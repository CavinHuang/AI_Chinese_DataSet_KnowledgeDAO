["Q: Why am I being asked for local password in 'update apple ID settings'? I factory reset my iPhone and set it up from new which caused the notification 'Update Apple ID settings' to appear on both my iPhone and my Mac. After asking for my apple ID password it then asked for my iPhone passcode on my phone and my Mac password on my Mac. I have reset my phone a few times in the last few months due to various issues and have never been asked for these local passwords before.\nThe exact message on my Mac read 'the password you use to unlock this mac will also be used to access saved passwords and other sensitive data you store in iCloud'. The message was coming from the settings app.\nWhy is this happening? Is there any reason why Apple needs these passwords?\nI have read things about this being something to do with iCloud Keychain but I have never had keychain on. Just want to know if this is something that is supposed to happen as it seems a bit odd to me.\n\nA: With new hardware and new OS - Apple can entangle the local device password and keychain to cryptographically log in to your iCloud account / AppleID account without needing your password once the setup and initial hand shake to sign in with that iCloud/AppleID is completed.\nThis confuses a lot of people since they are expecting to enter an iCloud password and not the local admin credentials. This change is across watchOS, TVOS, iPadOS, iOS and macOS.\nThis also can be prompted when you do a setup / transfer:\n\n*\n\n*iPhone asks for Mac password (or Mac asks for iOS password)\n\n*Why do our iPhones keep asking for passwords of other users?\n\n*Shady password required for Update Apple ID Settings\nI feel this is much more secure overall since it mitigates if you have a key logger and if you lose control of your local admin - this means someone can't use Keychain Access to reveal your iCloud password - it just reveals a secure token that works with one device and can't be abused to download your iCloud data from another device.\n", "Q: Cryptographic Integrity and Authentication Validation of Homebrew Installer? Is there a way to install homebrew on MacOS such that anything downloaded from the Internet is cryptographically validated for integrity and authenticated to the actual publisher?\nUnfortunately, the method listed on the official brew.sh website to install it on MacOS is a horribly insecure curl-piped-to-bash command\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n\n\nNote that https doesn't provide authentication since X.509 checks in curl trusts a ton of certificates (including certs issued by CAs owned by Nation States that have known history of committing cyber attacks, including active content manipulation over https via MITM attacks)\n\nIdeally, these cryptographic checks would come in the form of a signed checksum file using gpg.\nIs there any way to install brew in a way that provides cryptographic validation of the installer's integrity and authenticity?\n\nA: No, this ability is not provided by the brew project.\nAs an open source and community run project, no-one is providing assurance of the installer's integrity and authenticity.\nSee brew's Vulnerability Disclosure Program for more details about the project's handling of security concerns.\n", "Q: Python with Catalina : No module named 'OpenGL' I am running the examples provided by the PyQtGraph python graphic module, on a MacOS Catalina.

That launcher will now run on login, check mark on Hide so that it doesn't throw unwanted messages.\nAlternatively, you could make a zsh or bash script and tell AppleScript execute the shell script (given its absolute path) instead of specifying each command in AppleScript itself.\nEDIT: Instead of using Login Items, you can place the Application Bundle in /Library/StartupItems (though it is deprecated) if you want it to launch on startup instead of login.\n", "Q: Photos folder on external hard drive incessant disk usage for 5 years My photos collection has way over 500 gigabytes, and when I got a new Mac in 2015, I moved the collection to an external hard drive, and pointed Photos (iphoto by then?) to the external hard drive.\nSo far, so good. Everything works most of the time, with all the known glitches of Photos which are covered in many other questions.\nMy question is regarding disk usage. My hard drive is being used 100% of the time (and quite loudly), since 2015. The thing NEVER stops.\nI have spotlight disabled for that hard drive, and the people search doesn't show anything anymore (like that \"X images still need to be scanned).\nThe processes using the hard drive are\n\n*\n\n*mds\n\n*filecoordinationd (4 threads, same PID)\n\n*com.apple.MediaLibraryService (also 4 threads, 1 pid)\n\n*photolibraryd (12 threads)\n\n*cloudphotod\n\n*com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration (4 threads)\n\n*revisiond (4 threads).\n\nIf I kill all those processes, I end up with fseventsd in 1 thread, 28 threads of photoanalysisd, 1 thread of mds, and 4 threads of revisiond. It quiets things for a while, and the activity comes back after a while.\nWhy is this happening and how to fix it?\nAgain, this is bothering me for FIVE YEARS. It's not something temporary.\n\nA: You’ve moved to a new Mac and a clean, maybe even a newer OS with newer versions of the software (iPhoto vs Photos).  There’s a lot that macOS is going to do with all those files in their new home on your external drive indexing, analyzing photos, facial recognition, etc.\nThese things are going to happen so you’re going to have disk activity.  Every time you kill these processes because you believe there’s an issue only delays and prolongs the process that needs to happen.  You have, as you say 500GB of files most likely with a ton of meta data attached - it’s going to take time to process them.\nTo draw an analogy, this is like seeing your car rev its engine a few RPM’s higher on start up than normal and rushing to the mechanic because you believe it’s a problem.  It’s not.  It’s behaving normally for the conditions which is probably much colder that day than normal and requiring more revs of the engine to warm up; sorta like having 500GB of files in a new location not normal and having to spin the drives and process them. Once everything normalizes, your car will rev down and so will your drives.\n", "Q: How do I set the finder view to only list files and folder by name and not group by date modified? I'm using Mojave.\nI like to have all folders displayed in list view and sorted by name.\nI set the finder view options to sort by name, unchecked \"Use relative dates\" and clicked \"Use as Defaults\".\nBut if I go to upload a file, the finder groups files and folders by date modifed (today, yesterday, May, April...).\nIs there an easy way to change this so that I can only see it listed by name when I go to upload?\n\nA: Yes, at the top left of a Finder window, on the Toolbar, there are four icons for sorting files, and by default has the word View under them.\nThe second icon will show files in list view, and you can then click on the Name column to sort the files by name, as seen in the image below.\n\n", "Q: Do all iPhones really delete themselves after 10 failed passcode attempts? I don't actually own an Apple device, I'm just curious if what I just read is true:\nAllegedly all iPhones have a function that locks them after 10 wrong passcodes were entered. There is a delay after each attempt, but over an hour or two anyone can enter 10 wrong passcodes. This function can not be turned off. After the phone is locked, the only course of action that remains is to connect the phone to a computer and erase all data that was stored on the phone.\nIs this actually true?\n\nA: No it isn't.  There is an option that has to be set on iPhones and if you set that option, it makes you wait longer times in between repeated attempts. If your phone gets stolen the thief can only  try 10 times and on 11th attempt the phone will erase. But again the owner has to set that option for it to take effect. Yes Apple allows the owner of the phone to set that up if they want to. And you can turn it off when you choose. The default setting is off.\n", "Q: Non-Touch ID Mac says \"Touch ID requires password when Mac restarts\" I used Carbon Copy Cloner to move from one MacBook Pro to another and have found that while the newer Mac does not have the fingerprint sensor, the OS still reports \"Touch ID requires password when Mac restarts\".\nDoes anyone know how to clear this setting on my Non-Touch ID Mac?\n\nA: This is happening because the OS still probably thinks you're using a MacBook Pro with a fingerprint scanner. If you still have both MacBooks, a possible solution is to go back to the other MacBook Pro and disable the TouchID settings and then use Carbon Copy Cloner to move from the old MacBook Pro to the new MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Separating EFI partitions of Ubuntu 20.04 and Mac OSX on Macbook Pro I installed Ubuntu 20.04 alongside OSX on my early 2015 Macbook pro by following this answer.

I have multiple external drives, some with photo, app and video resources, some with client files and some with backup data dating back to 1988. I also have a number of BluRay backup disks with raw video footage and stock footage. Is there an existing app that can index each drive/disk when I mount it, then store a searchable index on my Mac HD? What I want is to search for, say, 'John Smith logo' and have the app give results for 'Drive G' or 'DISK 21'. I can then mount the indicated drive and retrieve the file, and not have to spend half an hour searching every time.\nSpotlight, I believe, only stores the index on the drive in question, so cannot search unconnected drives.\n\nA: I haven't used it in quite some time, but the go-to app for me, way back from System 9 days was CDFinder, now called NeoFinder & still maintained by its author, right up to Catalina.\nI used to use it for cataloguing dozens of backup & old project CDs & DVDs.

I am the owner of a MacBook Pro 2018 and I want to install Bootcamp on an external drive.\nI've been following a guide I found on the internet here, and I managed to create a bootable drive, but couldn't include the required drivers on it for continuing with the installation. I can't use neither the MacBook Keyboard/Touchpad or wireless keyboard/mouse, and I don't have any USB ones.\nSomeone called David Anderson (I think he's on here) commented on that guide that it'd be recommended to use the dism command as follows:\nDism /image:<path_to_image_directory> /add-driver /driver:<folder_containing_INF> /recurse /forceunsigned \n\nThe thing is that I don't understand how to do it, it sounds too abstract for me.\nCould anyone shed some light on this?\n\nA: The dism command you are referring to was originally posted as part of this answer. Colin William posted 2 responses which explain how and when to use a Windows laptop to execute the command.\nI originally posted that the dism command should be executed while running in the virtual machine. However, after reading Colin William's posts, I decided for this answer to build on his experience and post how to use the dism command after shutting down the virtual machine. The steps are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Julius Pargac's procedure calls for copying the Window Support Software to a MS-DOS (FAT) formatted 4 GB or larger flash drive. Instead, use a ExFAT formatted 16 GB or larger flash drive. Additionally, copy all the files from the Windows 10 ISO to this flash drive. The result should appear similar to what is shown below.\n\n\n\n*Proceed with Julius Pargac's procedure until after you have closed VirtualBox. This is immediately after you have manually shutdown the virtual machine.\n\n\n*Eject and unplug the external drive where windows is installed. Plug in the flash drive. Restart the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear. Select the external drive icon labeled EFI Boot.\n\n\n*The first window to appear should be similar to the one shown below.\n\nProceed as one would for a GUI installation of Windows. When a window similar to the one shown below appears, press the shift+F10 key combination.\n\nThe result should be the appearance of the Command Prompt window shown below.\n\n\n\n*Plug in the external drive where Windows is installed.\n\n\n*Enter the command given below. This will list the volumes.\necho list volume | diskpart\n\nFrom the output, determine the drive letters for the flash drive and the external drive where Windows is installed. I found letter C: for the flash drive and letter D: for the external drive where Windows is installed. If you have different drive letters, then make the appropriate substitutions when entering the command given below. This command copies the Windows Support Software drivers to the Windows 10 drivers store.\ndism /image:d:\\ /add-driver /driver:c:\\$WinPEDriver$ /recurse /forceunsigned\n\nNote: If a driver meant to be installed after Windows has finished installing, then an error message will be displayed. You can ignore such messages.\n\n\n*When finished, close the Command Prompt window and the Activate Windows window. If prompted, select the Yes button. The Mac should reboot to macOS.\n\n\n*After booting to macOS, eject and remove the flash drive. Proceed from where you left off in Julius Pargac's procedure.\nI do not have a MacBook Pro with a T2 chip to test the above steps.

Recently I have used an Apple Private Email Relay address to sign up with an app in order to hide my own email address. Everything went well and I purchased the subscription.\nNow I want to use the service on the other platforms as well. But in the web interface they are missing Sign In with Apple.\nSince I know my Apple Private Email Relay address I can still sign in with this email, but I need to reset the password to do so.\nI already requested password reset for the email address. But how could I access to the private relay email address's inbox.?\nThe mail has not been received by my default email address associated with my AppleID.\n\n*\n\n*Can I request password reset with an Apple Private Email Relay address?\n\n\n*How can I view emails sent to Apple Private Email Relay addresses?\n\n\n*Are mails sent to the Apple Private Email Relay address rerouted to the email address associated with the AppleID?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, in general you can request a password reset using the Apple private relay address. There is a small caveat in that the sender of the the password reset mail must authenticate their emails by registering their outbound email domains and using the Sender Policy Framework (SPF). This is a requirement for app developers / companies that wish to use the private email relay service that comes with \"Sign in with Apple\".\n\n\n*The emails sent to the private relay email address are forwarded on to your real email address and are received just like any other mail.\n\n\n*Yes, mails sent to the private relay email address is \"rerouted\" to the address associated with the AppleID (one of the verified email addresses).\nYou can read the full details on how this works from Apple here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_js/communicating_using_the_private_email_relay_service\n\nA: The currently accepted answer is incorrect.

I have a MacBookPro, Mid 2014.\nIn the system information, I see that I have an USB 3.0, with speed up to 12Mb/s.\nThis is already different from what I see on official specifications https://support.apple.com/kb/sp703?locale=en_US where the USB port speed is given as \"up to 5Gbps\".\nSo the question is: I want to buy an external SSD drive, giving priority to speed. But will it be meaningful to buy an SSD that boasts up to 550MB/s (68Mbps) when I have only 12Mbps?\nOr should I believe that I have 5Gbps?\nI'm a bit confused\n\nA: The external USB3 ports on the MacBook Pro Mid 2014 are definitely capable of 5 Gbps, and so it it is indeed meaningful to connect a SSD that way.\nNote that the actual speed of the USB links changes depending on what you connect to it. So if you connect some older, slower device - such as a for example an old USB mouse - you would see the speed listed as being significantly slower. The same can happen if you connect an older USB hub, or you connect several devices to the same port of differing speeds.\nAlso note that the MacBook Pro has internal USBs for things like the keyboard, trackpad and camera. The speed of these is irrelevant in terms of the performance you'll see with externally connected devices.\n\nA: Keep in mind that most every external SSD on the market is a common SATA SSD drive on the inside.  There's two common flavors of SATA today, there's SATA at 3 Gbps and at 6 Gbps.  Even with the 6 Gbps SATA interface on the inside the actual speeds of the data in and out of the drive will be closer to 4 Gbps, basically just fast enough that they didn't want to use the 3 Gbps interface and make that the bottleneck.\nIn other words the speed limitations will not likely be the 5 Gbps USB port.  If it were then they'd use something like Thunderbolt instead of USB as the interface for their high performance external SSD drive.\nThunderbolt can get more speed than USB but there are few drives that can both plug into Thunderbolt 2 and offer greater speeds than USB 3.0.  There are Thunderbolt 2 to SATA adapters available that will take USB out of the middle but it's not likely to give much in a speed bump, if it gives a bump at all, because unless you buy top end SSD drives they are still going to be common SATA 3 Gbps drives inside.\nIf you want more than the 3, 4, or maybe 5 Gbps that you'll get from USB SSD drives then investing in Thunderbolt 2 drives is a fool's errand, it's time to get a laptop with Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C.\n", "Q: Keep the camera activated while using other apps during a video conference When I am in a videoconference with any app (I have tested with zoom, facetime, discord and skype), if I change to another app my friend stops seeing my camera.\nMy issue is that I use the iPad to have zoom meetings where I share the screen and I move through the iPad and I need to keep the camera working while using other apps.\nIs it possible to achieve this using any other app or changing some configuration in the iPad?\n\nA: No, it is unfortunately not possible in any other app or by changing settings in the iPad.\nApple has explicitly forbidden apps to record videos while they are in the background, and iOS prevents this from happening.\nAs Apple writes here for app developers:\n\"Camera usage is prohibited while in the background.\"\n\nA: Based on the information in the AV Developer Kit, it is possible beginning with iOS 16, but the app has to explicitly support it:\n\nCamera access is usually limited to apps running in full-screen mode. If your app enters a multitasking mode like Split View, the system disables the camera. Starting in iOS 16, your app can use the camera while multitasking by setting the isMultitaskingCameraAccessEnabled property to true on supported systems. Enabling this behavior also extends to Picture in Picture mode using AVKit.

After a few seconds, previously launched applications start and can be used as usual, but the \"Setting up...\" screen remains and covers the desktop.\nAdditionally (and possibly related?), the set of application that re-opens at login appears fixed and is not affected by ticking/unticking the \"reopen applications at login\" box on the logout/restart confirmation popup.\nThis issue doesn't present itself when I start in safe mode.\nBased on OSX 10.13.4 'Sets up your Mac' every login, I attempted to uninstall my anti-virus software (Eset endpoint security), but this had no impact on the issue.\nI also tried creating the file /private/var/db/.AppleSetupDone as mentioned in How to stop Setup Assistant from showing up on every restart on Mac Mini with OS X Mavericks?\nI'm fairly sure that some 3rd party software is causing this issue, as reinstalling OSX resolves the issue, however I'd like to find out what the real problem is.\nIs there anything else I can check/try?\n\nA: Following jaume's comment, I checked my login items (https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mac-a-blue-screen-startup-problems-mh21210/mac).\nIt turns out that Setup Assistant had ended up in there, and was impossible to quit once opened.

When I run .pkg and Installer opens, it only gives me the option to install on my main disk.\nHow do I change this so I can specify where on my disk for the .pkg to install? Is there a 3rd party installer that would allow me to do this? Or would this require me to convert .pkg and edit the scripts? I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing, and I wouldn't call myself an advanced user, but more of an above average user...\nWhat I'm trying to do is move all my applications to ~/Applications rather than the default /Applications, but one of the apps I'm trying to move and reinstall is in a .pkg and I'm not sure how to run the .pkg and install the app and make sure all of its corresponding files correctly show that the app is in ~/Applications.\n\nA: Some installers allow custom install locations in the install wizard.\nHowever, if not, you can use the excellent third-party installer app, Pacifist.\nPacifist lets you browse the contents of installer packages, select components to install and choose install destinations.\nHowever, if an installer package contains files that rely on the app being in /Applications, or if it contains scripts that pre- or post-process files, there isn't an easy way of configuring things to work with a different location. Pacifist does let you have a look at such scripts inside the package, though.\nIt's more likely that the app itself requires other components to be in fixed locations, and that after installing normally, you can move the app to another location, particularly ~/Applications, which is an OS designated location for apps.\n", "Q: Linking between tables in different spreadsheets in Numbers I wonder if it's possible to link tables from different spreadsheets.\nI have several live projects running at the same time, for each I have a \"Project finance\" sheet, in which I have different tabs (Labour cost, Material cost, Project summary).\nI would like to create a SUMMARY sheet with all my project, where I can link/mirror copy the project summary tables from all my projects. This needs to be \"live\", i.e. as we make changes in the project finance sheets (as the projects progress), on this summary table it would update automatically.\nIn Google sheet this is the formula I would use, but I only recently started using Numbers and I couldn't find anything similar in there.\n=importrange(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138XdwtZoMVsdMwJOzT4R8Zzg2NNc9pxTV-ARDPvHoj8/edit#gid=63426406\",\"Customer finance!A1:N100\")\n\nYou can basically create a \"live carbon copy\" this way.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can reference every table on every sheet by name/title, as long as they are within the same document.\n(In the screenshot below, there is a table \"Material Cost\" in the sheet \"Material Cost\" with some values in column B that add up to 15.)\n\n", "Q: exec(\"php -v”) vs phpinfo() -- different php version I have upgraded PHP version on my Mac to 7.3 with a command\ncurl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 7.3\n\nand then\nexport PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH\n\nWhen I type php -v in terminal the new version shows up correctly.\n\nI am using Apache shipped with macOS.\nI have created a simple document in localhost/phpinfo.php that contains:\necho exec('which php');\n\necho '<br>';\n\n$out = [];\nexec(\"php -v\" , $out);\nforeach($out as $line) {\n    echo $line, '<br>';\n}\n\nphpinfo();\n\nThe phpinfo() shows the new PHP 7.3.8 as expected, but the preceding lines, using exec() command produce a different result.\n\nI was wondering if someone could explain why it is happening, does it matter at all, and if it is possible to fix it.\n\nA: This happens because you've still got the older PHP binary installed (probably in /usr/bin).\nWhen you change your PATH environment variable on the command to include /usr/local/bin - this means that the shell also searches that folder (and in that order) to find the program you want to run. In this case when you run php, it finds the new version in /usr/local/bin and runs that for you.\nHowever that PATH environment variable change is local to that shell session only. It is not saved anywhere, and not used in other contexts.\nThus when you run the phpinfo.php script through the web server, it runs with a standard PATH that doesn't include /usr/local/bin. Thus the older PHP binary is run - showing the old version number.\nIt really doesn't matter at all - why would you want to run a PHP binary from a PHP script run by the webserver anyways?\nIn case you really wanted to do that and wanted it \"fixed\", you could do that by either changing your exec() call to include the full path:\nexec(\"/usr/local/bin/php -v\" , $out);\n\nor by changing the PATH environment variable for in your PHP script context.\n", "Q: Can outlook365 for mac be installed and connect to an email server via a script?

Only very rarely it allows more than one device to be connected. And there isn't anything in the settings that can be tweaked. Google search also doesn't show anyone with this problem. I am at a loss as to why it is happening.\nEdit: Updated to latest iOS 14.0, still unresolved\n\nA: I use hotspot quite a bit and can report that this isn’t how the system is designed. I have many devices connect to one hotspot and am pretty certain I tested that back when I had your iPhone 7 hardware in the US so it should be easy to confirm it’s capable of multiple connections.\nWhat was true in the past was carriers (for example Verizon and AT&T capped connections at 5) can establish these limits for most of their data plans.\n\n*\n\n*How can carrier limit hot spot connections\nSince your cellular carrier specifies whether you can use the hotspot or not, have you reached out to them to determine if they have enabled any restrictions or profiles relating to hotspot usage? In the US, all of the carriers I have seen don’t cause this to happen, so I’d hate to tell you to update / wipe your device and test with all content and settings erased if this is something the carrier controls.\n\nA: Short Answer:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, two devices can be connected to an iPhone.\n\n*Connect the 2 (or more than 2) devices at the same time to iPhone personal hotspot.\n\n*Check for carrier limit, but usually iPhone and carrier limit is 5 devices.\n\nDescription:\nI also use iPhone7 and has the same problem. But this is not because iPhones allow only one device to be connected at the same time.\nIf it is another Apple product with the same iCloud, you can connect it even without turning on personal hotspot.\nBut if you are turning on the Personal Hotspot, and connecting a device, whether an apple device or a non-apple device, the hotspot will stays on but after few minutes, when you search for wifi in another device, the Hotspot wont be visible, because iPhone uses similar technology like hiding or encrypting the SSID.\nTo connect 2 or more Devices to iphone Wi-Fi, try to connect it together at the same time.\nThere is no settings that can be tweaked for this problem. This is kind of a security feature, that prevents any cracking of Wi-Fi passwords and Apple won't be changing that in forthcoming updates.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt cable that only works as USB 3.1 I have an LG 5k Ultrafine screen which does not work when connected to my Macbook Pro 2018. Before thinking that the screen may not be working, it could be that the cable which isn't working.\nIn order for it to work, it must be a Thunderbolt 3 cable, which I know it is (I bought it and it used to work with the screen). I plugged the cable Macbook <> Different USB-C device and it did work, however it Apple -> About this Mac -> System Report, the device only gets shown in the USB 3.1 bus instead of the Thunderbolt section.\nAre there ways to test if the cable that I have is a working Thunderbolt 3 cable?\n\nA: I'll step through some obvious reasons this might not work, so don't feel offended if this sounds \"basic\" and you've done this already.  The setup you describe should work so it comes down to a bad setup or bad hardware.\nThe first thing is to see if the cables are in fact Thunderbolt cables.  They should have USB-C connectors on each end and the Thunderbolt icon on one or both connectors.  If you don't know what the icons look like for the different connectors/ports then take a look at Apple's support page on this: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201736\nThe second thing to check is that the devices needing the most bandwidth are connected closest to the computer.  Connect the Thunderbolt cable to the Thunderbolt ports on the Mac and the display.  Any USB-C devices connected in this chain should be connected to the ports on the back of the display.  It's best to connect any USB-C devices directly to the Mac if you can since they can \"steal\" needed bandwidth from the display.\nA Thunderbolt cable is \"dumb\", as in these cables don't often have any electronics in them to identify them as a Thunderbolt cable when connected to a Mac.  A Thunderbolt cable when used to connect a USB 3.x device will look like a USB cable to the computer, it doesn't know the difference.\nIf walking through the wiring and checking that it's like I describe then perhaps something is broken.  Do what you can to verify all cables are working, as well as the display and devices.\n\nA: \nAre there ways to test if the cable that I have is a working Thunderbolt 3 cable?\n\nYes.  Purchase a cable from a known vendor with a reputation for quality.  I tend to stick with Anker, Cables2Go (C2G), Belkin, and Pluggable (cables, not peripherals) and even Apple (well,  whoever Apple selected to OEM for them).\nC|Net summarized it perfectly in their article Here's everything you need to know about USB-C and Thunderbolt 3:\n\n\n*\n\n*All Thunderbolt 3 cables will work as USB-C cables.\n\n*All USB-C cables will work as Thunderbolt 3 cables as long as they are good quality cables.\n\nEmphasis mine\nIt’s when you start rummaging around in the bargain bin looking for low cost USB and Thunderbolt cables that you end up with cables that just don’t work the way they’re supposed to.  Spend the few extra dollars up front and it’s something you won’t have to worry about (meaning spending hours diagnosing and days waiting for your delivery from <insert favorite online retailer here>)\nIf you plug a TB cable into a TB3 port and hook it up to a USB device, it’s going to show in the “USB section.”  Likewise, plug it into the same port but now the device is a TB device (like a dock), ot will show up in the “Thunderbolt section.”  In other words, the cable doesn’t define how the device appears -the device snd the port do.  It’s also important to remember that Thunderbolt 3 carries USB 3.1 but not the other way around.\nAs for your LG cable, I wouldn’t preclude it being of suspect quality.  Just physically comparing the Apple cable (which I already owned) and the LG cabled included in the box, the Apple cable was clearly of higher quality.  I’ve chucked more “included” cables because of horrible build quality than I care to remember.  Remember, a lot of this is to meet a requirement, check off a box on a list somewhere and most folks won’t notice the difference\n", "Q: How do I drag a text box in Preview?

How do I do that?\nApple's reference says, \"To move the text box, just drag it.\" But, I haven't figured out how to do that.\n\nA: \n\nMove the mouse cursor over the Text box and the cursor should change to hand icon. When it does, simply drag the Text box.\n\nA: You select the text box and then position the cursor over the center of the text box. Now left-click your mouse button and wait a second or two.

I can't find anywhere how to do it.\nI figured that having a Mac, it would be easier to download the ISO file and then create the virtual machine.\nBut still, I managed to download an ISO, but it is becoming impossible to create the virtual machine.\nWhen I load the ISO, the message I get is this:\n\nWhat I have seen is that to create the virtual machine of Mac OS, in Windows or in Linux, it requires writing a series of commands in the CMD or Terminal respectively.\nMaybe that's it but I don't know.\n\nA: This is gonna be an overview of the process which I completed a few months ago. It doesn't require spending money on commercial software just a bit of fiddling.\nI haven't investigated recently but last I looked VirtualBox doesn't support APFS or booting from APFS. So that is part of the problem. Maybe it has been fixed in the last few months, I don't really know.\nDownload a (free) copy of VMware's virtualization software Fusion. It's free to use for 30 days. No worries there as this procedure will take a lot less time than that.\nThere are a number of \"Making a macOS VM in VMware Fusion\" web pages out there so I'm not going to go into all of that, but there are some non-obvious settings you will need to find to make this work. I used this. There are others.\nOnce you have macOS Mojave working in VMware Fusion you create a second virtual drive and using Disk Utility on the just created VM, reformat virtual drive 2 as HFS+. This is important as it's APFS by default. It needs to be HFS+ to work with VirtualBox.\nOnce formatted you can use a backup program like SuperDuper! or CCC to clone the working installation to Virtual Drive 2. If you prefer you could just install Mojave onto Virtual Drive 2 (HFS+). However you do it, you will end up with a VMware Fusion VM with macOS Mojave bootable on two virtual drives. One formatted as APFS and one formatted as HFS+.\nNow set Fusion to boot off of the HFS+ virtual disk and boot from it. Then you just delete the original (APFS) virtual disk from within Fusion. Actually delete it from disk don't just remove it from inventory.\nThen you open the Fusion virtual machine file like you would an .app package (right-click > Show Package Contents...) and copy all the files out of the package into a location you want to use for VirtualBox VMs.\nVirtualBox will then open the VMware Fusion VM.\nIt is a bit of a PITA but the trick is using Fusion as a stepping stone to VirtualBox via an HFS+ bootable drive image.\nI don't think this will work with Catalina as the guest VM. That pretty much requires APFS and Mojave does not.\nOh and you can trash VMware Fusion now...\n\nA: First I should mention this question was already asked and answered back in February. See Installing Catalina OS in VirtualBox? The comments and accepted answer read like a historical record of all the problems encountered with previous versions of VirtualBox. However, most of these problems have been fixed.\nThe current version of VirtualBox is 6.1.8 r137981 (Qt5.6.3). The version will work with Catalina (macOS 10.15.5). However, the Guest Additions (drivers) software will not work with macOS versions that boot from APFS volumes.

We have a scheduled job that we want to run on both our macOS and Linux hosts.\nOn Linux, with systemd we can just use this:\nConditionPathExists=/etc/this_file_must_exist\nConditionPathExists=!/etc/skip_if_this_exists\n\nand the job will only execute if the first file exists, and the second file is absent (so we can pause the scheduled job from running, e.g. if we're testing a new version).\nIs there an equivalent on macOS? I've seen others achieve a similar result by using Bash and just running `[[ -f /etc/this_file_must_exist ]] && run_my_job`` but this seems... not to be the ideal way.\nlaunchd.plist's manpage (https://www.manpagez.com/man/5/launchd.plist/ -- official link seems down) has KeepAlive but that's for keeping the service up, not preventing it from starting.\nThanks!\n\nA: Short answer: Nope.\nlaunchd can start jobs at scheduled times (with the StartCalendarInterval key), when particular files are modified (WatchPaths), or when files appear in a particular directory (QueueDirectories), but it doesn't have a way to test existence of a specific file, nor to combine conditions the way you want to.\nSo... something like a bash wrapper is what you're looking at. You can either write a bash script and run that with a StartCalendarInterval trigger, or use the ProgramArguments array to embed a miniature script directly in the plist:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>[[ -e /etc/this_file_must_exist ]] && [[ ! -e /etc/skip_if_this_exists ]] && exec /path/to/my_job</string>\n</array>\n\nNote: I'd recommend running your job from bash with exec; that makes the job replace the shell (rather than running as a subprocess), so launchd can monitor and manage it more directly.\n", "Q: Can a projector be used as a good quality second screen? I've never attached a projector to my Mac, so I don't know just how good the really good ones can be. I'm a graphic designer who used to use a 27 inch iMac but now works on a laptop most of the time. I'd occasionally like to see my screen at a larger size with enough detail to be pleasant to use—no need for extreme HD. How would a good projector go at mirroring my laptop screen onto a flat surface? I'm wondering if there's a reason that projectors aren't touted as an alternative to a secondary screen...this concept doesn't appear anywhere I've looked online. If someone is doing this I would like to know specific projector models that you are happy with to create a secondary display for your Mac.\nHow bright would it need to be to show up in the daytime? I'm interested to know people's experiences with the number of lumens needed for having a really clear daytime picture. I've researched this but am still unsure.\nI'm aware that it may possibly be cheaper to buy a secondary screen, but the portability of a projector would be a big plus if the display quality was good enough (accurate colour, good resolution).\nAlso, will the projector echo the exact screen colour of my laptop? So if nightshift is on, will the projected image show that yellowing or will it be bright white?\n\nA: The answer to this question is always going to be heavily based on opinion, so it is not really a good question for this site.\nHowever, I think it is for good reasons that projectors are not really treated as \"secondary screens\" for computers - but more for specialized use cases such as movies, presentations, etc.\nIf you have ever attendeded any project-backed presentation, you would probably have encountered many of the problems that can occur with projectors: too much daylight to be able to see the image clearly, skewed/warped image, incorrect colors, fan noise, heat generation, noone can be in front of the project output, etc.\nYou could argue that you could solve most of these by buying a high end projector and setting it up properly. However those projectors are not cheap - and definitely if you compare it to what a budget 30\" monitor or even a flat-screen TV costs.\nAs for getting the exact same colors on the projected image as on your laptop display - this not really possible. The colors are not going to be exactly the same, unless you buy a really, really high-end projector that you calibrate often.\n", "Q: How to delete or change the words \"My card\" under my own name at the top of \"Contacts\"? (iOS 13.5.1) When I open \"Contacts\" on my iPhone XR running iOS 13.5.1, the person listed at the top is me. The index entry consists of three parts: my name in bold; an image I've chosen; and, under my name in smaller type, the words \"My Card\".\nHow can I delete or change the words \"My Card\"? (Note: this is all I want to change. I do not want to delete myself as a contact, or my name, or the image.)\n\nA: You can’t change those words. They are hard coded into the application and it shows them to identify which contact in the app identifies you.\nIf you don’t want that contact to be identified as you, go into the preferences for the contacts app and choose a different card under “My Info”. If that doesn’t work, you can delete the card and re-add it, but without choosing the card as your contact details.\n", "Q: ScreenFlow won't record screen after transferring data to new MacBook Pro running Catalina I've just bought a new 16\" MacBook Pro and I've transferred all my data, but now ScreenFlow won't record the screen anymore.\nIt must be a permission problem, so I've opened System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording but I can't add ScreenFlow:\n\nCan someone help me to add ScreenFlow again to the authorized list?\n\nA: I fixed the problem by using the following command in Terminal:\ntccutil reset All net.telestream.screenflow9\n\nThen restarted the Mac.\n", "Q: How to copy pdf file to Books using File manager?

I haven't really had a problem with it until recently... but there are 2 variables:\nWhat's Changed?\n\n*\n\n*Catalina upgrade to 10.15.5 recently\n\n*Applecare service replaced the logic board\n\nQuestions\n\n*\n\n*Is it likely that the replacement logic board is not up to snuff?\n\n*I haven't heard any complaints online (reddit, stack exchange, apple support) of thermal throttling lately.  How does one test abnormal throttling?\n\nScreenshots\n\n*\n\n*terminal output after running pmset -g thermlog\n\n*intel power gadget showing the aforementioned stats holding steady despite high CPU Utilization.\n\n\n\nA: Thermal throttling is normal behavior for laptops.  However, I did not expect the extent to throttling in everyday applications.\nWhile Cinebench R20 shows robustness against thermal throttling, Adobe Premiere Pro thermal throttles right away.  The only explanation I can think of is that Cinebench R20 does not engage GPU while Adobe Premiere Pro does.  When CPU + GPU are both used in conjunction, thermal throttling happens immediately.\nI suppose this is a limitation of laptops.\n", "Q: Can I pair both a logitec Crayon and a Brydge keyboard with my ipad (6th gen) at the same time? Given my ability to lose pens, I want to use as cheap a stylus as possible with my ipad. Most of the alternatives use bluetooth, as does the Brydge keyboard.  Can I use both at once, or do I have find a non-blue-tooth stylus.\nMultiple matching doesn't aways work:  My Subaru will talk to my phone or my wife's phone at any given time.  I have to manually switch from one phone to the other from the Subaru audio centre.\n\nA: You can connect multiple bluetooth devices at one time to any device that supports bluetooth.\nThere's nothing special about the iPad bluetooth setup.  I have a few iPads and I connect Apple Pencils and bluetooth speakers and a Brydge keyboard to them at the same time.\nTo address your edit to your question, you can't use more than one device of the same profile at the same time, i.e. 2 BT speakers or 2 iPhones.  That's just how BT works and isn't unique to Apple products.\nThe pencil and the keyboard are different device types so you can use them at the same time.\n", "Q: OSX Window server vulnerabilities on catalina This question will be a long one, as I have given lot of time in doing research and also I have attached all my research in the question itself.\nThe window server/ display server used on linux is X11, on which OSX's window server XQuartz (now almost deprecated) was based on. Recently it was discovered in 2013 that this X11 has a very big vulnerability. article here.\nThe above article mentions the following\n\nFor those that don't know, X was originally designed and released in\n1985 and X11 in 1987. X.org replaced X11 and was originally released\nApril 6, 2004. When X was originally conceived, the computing world\nwas in a completely different state. Both X and X.org lack a few very\nimportant security features that are critical for modern era usage and\nhardware:\n\n*\n\n*All X applications have access to everything on your screen\n\n*All X applications can register to receive every keystroke, regardless of which window said keystrokes are typed within\n\n*Applications such as browsers can be remotely controlled such that keystrokes can be forged as if the user were typing them\n\n*The xhost + option can completely disable any security on the display\n\n\nOlder XQuartz (used by apple) was very much based on this X11, and hence these vulnerabilities were also there on MacOS.\nXQuartz official website mentions the following\n\nThe XQuartz project is an open-source effort to develop a version of\nthe X.Org X Window System that runs on OS X. Together with supporting\nlibraries and applications, it forms the X11.app that Apple shipped\nwith OS X versions 10.5 through 10.7.\n\nIn 2017, apple made a shift away from this XQuartz as the main display server/ window server as mentioned here.\n\nAbout X11 for Mac\nX11 is no longer included with Mac, but X11 server and client\nlibraries are available from the XQuartz project.\nApple created the XQuartz project as a community effort to further\ndevelop and support X11 on Mac. The XQuartz project was originally\nbased on the version of X11 included in Mac OS X v10.5. There have\nsince been multiple releases of XQuartz with fixes, support for new\nfeatures, and additional refinements to the X11 experience. Apple is a\ncontributor to the XQuartz project and has worked to ensure that X11\nworks as expected with macOS and latest available versions of XQuartz.\nX11 server and client libraries for macOS are available from the\nXQuartz project at www.xquartz.org. Download the latest version\navailable.\n\nCurrently apple uses the following mentioned in this answer from 2016 (almost 4 years old) which is also valid today as mentioned here on apple's website.\nMy question now; Is this mentioned technology, currently used by apple still as vulnerable as the X11 on major linux distros? Is the freely accessing other running apps' data and keystrokes vulnerability still there today or has it been solved?\n\nA: Apple does not use X11 or XQuartz in any way. It's an entirely third-party app, created to run the X windows environment inside Apple's own Quartz graphics system.\nThe last build of XQuartz was released in 2016. Most people only use it to run particular software, like FontForge. They are unlikely to use it as a general computing environment.\nI suspect that the security problems you mention only exist within the X environment, rather than bleeding out into MacOS's own window server. Apple has introduced all sorts of security features to restrict applications' operations and scope of influence, so I would be very surprised if these flaws existed.\n", "Q: Encrypted disk is \"corrupt\" but unencrypted is fine I have a USB hard drive that I want to use as my Time Machine backup disk.

In the App Store, the app just says Open.\nI’ve tried shutting it down multiple times (didn’t work).The app is grey with lines and it’s Snapchat.\nHow can I remove it from Settings?\n\nA: To expand on my comment. Often these kind of issues respond to the backup, wipe, restore process. Here it is in greater detail\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone (or iPad) into your computer, launch iTunes and select the option to back up your device locally (rather than iCloud)\n\n*IMPORTANT Set a password for the backup. That will ensure the backup preserves all saved passwords. you will need to remember your AppleID password and unlock PIN.\n\n*Once the backup has completed, go into iCloud and turn off Find My iPhone, and unplug the phone from your computer.\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Reset and tap on Erase all contents and settings. you will be asked to confirm. Do so. The reset will take a few minutes. When it is done the iPhone will be at the setup screen, just like when you bought your phone.\n\n*Early in the setup process you will be given the option to restore from backup. Choose that, plug your phone into the computer and proceed with the restore.\n\n*When the restore is done the phone will reboot and proceed to download all your Apps. Unfortunately Apps are no longer stored on the computer during a backup so they all have to download, this may take a while depending on how fast your internet connection is.\n\nWhen that is done you will have a freshly restored iPhone, identical, in configuration and settings as it was before. you will have to re-enter your AppleID and AppleID password but everything should still be there.\nNote that doing this will usually clear temporary/deleted files that are otherwise not deletable, clearing usable space on your iOS device. It will also solve a lot of issues with the phone acting strangely and apps not working correctly, as well as the ghost app icons sometimes seen.\n", "Q: External display attached to MacBook Pro has washed out colours I have a BenQ BL3201 display, connected via HDMI (and a USB-C dongle) to my 2019 15\" MacBook Pro.  Light grey areas are completely washed out, and appear white.  I've attached some photos to demonstrate.\nBuilt-in Display:\n\nExternal Display:\n\nI've adjusted the brightness, contrast, gamma, and every other setting on the monitor, but none of it resolves this problem.  The monitor even has a special 'M-BOOK' mode for MacBooks that doesn't improve things at all.  I've gone through every available display profile, and the only one that helps with this issue is 'ACES CG Linear' (but it looks worse in other ways, colours are very dark and muted).\nThe monitor was previously attached to to a Desktop Linux box, and it didn't show the same issue there.\nIs there any setting or tweak that I can use to resolve this issue?\n\nA: It does look like a calibration issue.\nThe only way to properly calibrate is with a hardware colorimeter [anywhere from $£€ 70 to $£€ 250 & upwards] but you can try to get the worst of it fixed yourself…\nSystem Prefs > Displays > Colour\nYou get one of these per display & interacting with each will affect that display only.\nTo the right is a Calibrate… button, which can give a very general set of tweaks - however, if you hold Opt before clicking it, it will open out some more complex adjustments.

But just in case it becomes unavailable, here's\na short summary:\nThe external monitor is using the YPbPr colour format over HDMI.  Something about the MacBook Pro YPbPr output is not compatible with the monitor.  It's possible to create override settings to force the HDMI connection to use RGB instead, using a script at https://gist.github.com/adaugherity/7435890.\nHere are the instructions from the above post:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the problematic display.\n\n*Download and run this script\n(./patch-edid.rb). Take a look at the generated file and remember\nits path.\n\n*Reboot into recovery mode (⌘-R at boot).\n\n*Mount your main disk (enter Disk Utility, select the gray Macintosh HD, click\nMount, provide your password, close Disk Utility).\n\n*Open up a terminal (Utilities ->Terminal), backup the overrides directory,\ncopy in your new override file, and reboot:\n\ncd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources \ncp -R Overrides Overrides.bak \ncp -R <path to directory generated in step 1> Overrides/ \nreboot\n\n\nA: \nI had this exact problem of the external monitor having washed out colors and, for me, the solution was to uncheck \"High Dynamic Range\"\n\nA: I had the same problem and using Display Port resolved it. It seems when using HDMI with a Mac it thinks the monitor is a TV and the pixels are slightly out of alignment causing the banding and a red/green hue on text.\n\nA: Heres what helped me solve the issue.\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences->Displays\nIn the display settings of the external monitor you might see 2-3 options under \"Scaled\".

I have them connected via Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt with the TB2 to TB3 adapter. For whatever reason, I'm not able to use Target Display mode on my 2015 iMac, and I'm suspecting it's because the model doesn't support it. ETA: The other mac doesn't show up in either System Preferences > Displays menu\nI'm hoping someone can offer advice as to what I'm doing wrong or a possible workaround for this issue, as I have no use for both iMacs separately but would greatly benefit from using one as an additional display - even if the answer is simply that I can't do it, it will at least allow me to stop spinning my wheels and give up on this pipe dream.\nAny suggestions are welcome!\n\nA: I'm afraid neither of those iMacs is capable of Target Display Mode\nGenerally it was iMacs between 2009 & 2014 that supported it, no retina iMacs were included.\nSee Lifewire - How to Use Your Old iMac as a Monitor\nUnfortunately, Apple's own KB article on this seems to have recently vanished.\n\nA: I found the Apple Support document on Target Display Mode.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592\nThe last iMac to support for Target Display Mode was made in 2014.

What is the difference between the two?\n\nA: Yes, this in fact is an existing restriction with Catalina (see screenshot). It is unsurprising that the version of Mac OSX after Catalina has the same limitation; ultimately the hardware gets left behind as it becomes incompatible with changes in the OS.\nSee this table from https://eshop.macsales.com/guides/Mac_OS_X_Compatibility:\n\nEveryMac lists the specifications of the Early and Late 2013 MacBook Pros at https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/macs-released-in-2013.html\n\nA: An \"early 2013\" is either a MacBookPro10,1 or a MacBookPro10,2... same machine ID as the 2012's, just with faster processors. They ARE in everymac's list and in mactracker's list... don't waste time with information from OWC.\nThe answer to your question about support is that the 10,x are on the vintage list, and the 11,x are not. The 11,x have arguably better graphics support than the 10,x do.\nThe 10,x machines support Catalina. ref: support.apple.com/en-us/HT210222\n\nA: \nDoes it mean the Early 2013 MacBook Pro won't be able to run macOS Big Sur?\n\nNo, it means it's not supported.\nThere's plenty of evidence of macOS running on unsupported hardware.  There's a cottage industry of people building a \"hackintosh\" for themselves.  A \"hackintosh\" is non-Apple hardware running macOS, done by careful selection of hardware and with modifications made to the installer to bypass the checks for supported Apple computers.\nOne reason Apple drops support for older hardware is that they don't come with a powerful enough GPU out of the box.  Add the right kind of GPU and it may install.  Perhaps the older computers don't always come with enough RAM or drive space, a configure to order model might work.\nPoint is that there's going to be people that will want to run Big Sur on unsupported hardware and given the success of past attempts they will be successful again to some degree.\n", "Q: In a group text, how do you reply to the same numbers that were originally messaged? I am on the receiving end of this problem and am trying to resolve the issue for my brother, who has an iPhone.\nI have two mobile numbers (we'll call them Phone A and Phone B). When my sister (who is on an Android) sends a group text to my brother and to me on Phone A, I receive it on Phone A as expected and can reply without issue. However, when my brother replies to the thread, it goes to my sister and to me on Phone B. How does my brother resolve this issue so that when he replies to the group thread, it goes to Phone A as intended?\n\nA: It sounds like your brother has a different contact for you than your sister does. If your brother replies to you it may be using the number in contacts for you. He would need to change the Contact number to the number you use for Phone A.\n\nA: Your brother could \"maintain the single contact record\" (i.e., one contact card for you) by moving the Phone B number on that card from being one of the named numbers at the top of the card, to instead appearing in the \"Notes\" section below. Number B would still be on the card, but his iPhone shouldn't then use Number B for a text \"reply all.\"\nFor example, I dummied up a contact card for you, as it probably now appears in your brother's phone. It includes both your cell number A and cell number B:\n\nHere's the same contact card, with the cell B number moved down into the \"Notes\" field:\n\nIf your contact card on your brother's phone is like the second image, when a text is sent to him and to you, and he selects \"reply all,\" his text response to you will be sent to phone A, and not to phone B.\nThis was done in macOS. Do you need me to do the same in iOS so you can see how it looks there?\n", "Q: Using Partitioned External Harddrive with Bootcamp I tried connecting my external harddrive to my computer while booted in Bootcamp, but it wouldn't recognize the drive. I'm pretty sure this is because it was formatted for Mac computers. If I partition part of the drive and format it in exFat, will I be able to use that formatted partition within Bootcamp?\n\nA: If you installed the Windows Support Software, then Windows should be able to recognize Mac OS Extended (Journaled) formatted volumes. AFAIK, Windows can not recognize APFS volumes without third party software. If an external HDD contains a ExFAT formatted partition, then any version of Windows running on a Mac can access the volume. Although, older versions of Windows may need a to have an update installed. Here, I assume the external HDD is using a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or GUID Partition Table (GPT).\n\nNote: There are newer Macs running Windows that can access APFS containers for the purpose of selecting the system to use to start up your computer.\n\n", "Q: I deleted Macintosh HD - Data and now the computer won't boot even in Recovery Mode Okay all, I think I messed up really big time.\nWas so excited and delighted today to see my brand spanking new MacBook Air arrive (running Catalina). Everything was wokring great; I started Migration Assistant to get it migrating over from my old computer and, after a little while for the preliminaries, it said it was going to be 6.5 hours. So I thought let's not do this right now, so I can still use the old computer, and cancelled it.\nThat was my first mistake.\nIt wouldn't let me go back to the original state of Migration Assistant; the users were already on the new computer. Okay, fine, I have to go into Utilities to find Migration Assistant on the new computer. But then when Migration Assistant did start up again, it would keep freezing in the early stages, stalled and not progressing - never even got to the part where it estimated time remaining. It did this in multiple ways, whether I was connected through WiFi or Ethernet, direct from the old Mac or through my Time Capsule.\nSo I figured I wanted to start clean. And this appears to be where I made the REALLY big mistake. I thought \"well, I'll just wipe the data so I can start clean, right?\" I tried to followed instructions for a factory reset: went into Recovery Mode (cmd-R), entered Disk Utility, deleted the Macintosh HD-Data partition. I thought that what I was supposed to do next was delete the Macintosh HD partition too. But it wouldn't let me do that because it was in use. I also tried to reinstall the US, and it wouldn't let me do that either (also because it was in use). Okay, I thought, I'll just restart and see what happens.\nAnd now my brand new $1800 computer is completely bricked.\nThe Apple logo appears, followed briefly by the start of the progress bar - and then I hear this whooshing sound, like ocean surf or a heavy breath, and it turns back off again... and then the Apple logo appears again and the same thing happened. Over and over on an endless cycle, just Apple and whoosh. I can sometimes get it to turn off by holding the power button, but turning it back on just gives me the endless cycle and whooshing again; I can't get into Recovery mode. In the old days I would have tried sticking a paper clip in or some other option for a hard reboot, but there's nowhere to do that.\nHelp! How can I get back to a brand-new computer with the old data smoothly migrated?\n\nA: If you have a time machine backup of your old computer or can make one (buy or borrow a spare disk drive) you can recover using the backup in recovery mode.

I use digital crafting files and can download them from Internet without issue, but on discs I own, I cannot work out how to transfer from the discs to the iPad.\n\nA: There’s no native way read a digital disc on an iPad, and I don’t think a 3rd party manufacturer makes such a solution.\nYou will need to extract these files from the discs on a computer, macOS or Windows, then upload them to whatever cloud service you’re using to make them available on the Internet to your iPad. If you don’t have a cloud service, iCloud is one option, as nohillside mentions above, but there are others such as Dropbox or Google Drive. Dropbox and Drive have iOS apps to handle file transfers. I use all three cloud services on my iOS and macOS devices.\nDisclaimer: I am not an employee of Apple, Dropbox nor Google.\n\nA: I tried connecting a DVD drive to my iPhone 8 by an Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter and I was not successful in reading any discs.  The adapter does work with the USB 3 flash drive I tried to make sure I didn't have a hardware failure elsewhere.\nThis was with an iPhone 8 and not an iPad Pro so perhaps not a valid test.  The iPad Pro is more \"computer like\" than the iPhone and so might support a DVD drive plugged into it.  If you have any USB DVD drives around then it doesn't hurt to try it.  Be aware that USB powered DVD drives are very picky about the ports they plug into, they take a lot of power and not all hubs or adapters will provide the power they need.  Use a drive that takes power from somewhere other than USB if you can.\nIf plugging in a DVD drive into the iPad does not work then you'll need something to be an intermediary.  An Apple computer with a DVD drive might work best as that means you can use AirDrop and not have to copy the files to some place in the middle.  Using a flash drive should work, copy the files off the DVD onto the flash drive with a computer and then move the flash drive to the iPad to copy them off there.  Copying the files to iCloud, Google Drive, DropBox, or other internet file service, as mentioned by other commenters, can work too.  If you have an AirPort, Time Capsule, or other similar file sharing capable wireless access point, then you should be able to share a flash drive or something to copy the files over.\nIf the files are not too big then maybe e-mail them to yourself and pick them out of the e-mail on your iPad.  That's appears to be a fairly common practice I've seen people use.\nThere's a lot of ways to try.  Good luck.\n", "Q: What is the current status of handwriting recognition on the iPad with an air pencil or stylus Ideally I want to be able to use my ipad as a clipboard running google sheets to do inventory entry.  So I'm looking for a general purpose stylus to text converter.\nSeems strange that Palm got this pretty close to right 20 years ago, but there is little progress since.\nResearch into this found a flurry of articles written shortly after the air pencil came out, but I've found little since then.  So my current answer is, \"Moribund\"\n\nA: iOS currently doesn't support handwriting recognition on OS level. There are apps for the Pro models (with Apple Pencil) that recognize handwriting, but this won't help you with Google Sheets or similar.\nThings appear to be more bright with iOS 14 (the version to be released later in 2020). Apple will introduce handwriting recognition on OS level, at least for the Pro models, with a feature called Scribble. Check out https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/ for the details already known.\n\n\nA: One way is use the Mazec key board app http://www.product.metamoji.com/en/mazec/\nIt sort of works with normal handwriting but i think I think -Palm Pilot recognition was better\nMazec suggested the last  part after the hyphen so some things have improved\nthe app provides an area to write in that replaces the keyboard\n", "Q: How can I hide persistent Facetime audio call on macOS? When I'm on a Facetime audio call, I'm not able to hide or minimize or move that persistent audio call banner.

Enable Do Not Disturb and the banner will disappear even when on the call.\nYou can enable Do Not Disturb from the Notification Center. You can access the Notification Center by clicking the Notification Center icon at the top right of the screen. Or by sliding two fingers on the trackpad, from right to left but starting from the outside of the trackpad.\n", "Q: How make BBEdit Color Scheme follow system dark mode setting BBEdit has an awesome setting to make the application appearance match the selected editor color scheme – so when selected, if you select a dark color scheme in Preferences, it puts the app's chrome into dark mode.\nI'm looking for the opposite. Is there a way to make BBEdit adopt the BBEdit Dark color scheme when the system is in dark mode, and the BBEDit Light color scheme when the system is not in dark mode? I don't think there's a simple BBEdit preference to do this, but BBEdit is legendarily AppleScriptable.\nI use the awesome app Night Owl to switch my system between light and dark mode at sunrise and sunset, so I frequently change between light and dark modes for the OS, and I'd love it if BBEdit followed automatically. If there were an AppleScript that somehow either was triggered when the system changed modes, that periodically polled the system to see if it was light or dark and made sure that BBEdit was using the appropriate color scheme to match the system mode, or did something else creative to be sure that BBEdit used a light color scheme when I am writing things in the daytime and a dark color scheme when I am writing at night, that would be awesome.\nIn case it matters, I'm running BBEdit 12.6.7 and macOS 10.14.5.\n\n\nA: BBEdit 13.0 introduced automatic color scheme switching based on the prevailing OS color scheme. (And it runs on macOS 10.14.2 and later, so you'll be able to use it.) Here's a screen shot of what it looks like in 13.1 (the current public release, as of when I wrote this answer.)\nThis is probably a simpler and more reliable solution than trying to automate it externally.\n\n", "Q: Corsair Virtuoso Sidetone on MacOS I am setting up a new Corsair Virtuoso headset on my Mac computer.

In the past, I put temp files in /tmp/  folder, and the OS automatically purges them as time goes by.\nI'm now considering using the alternative folder /Users/username/Library/Caches/myFolder/   but before I do, I want to make sure that it won't fill-up the user's disk.  Will the OS automatically delete older files in that folder?\n\nA: In my mind, Caches should not be cleaned by an OS.\nIn general, the process that generates the cache is responsible for always working - if the cache is missing it should recreate it, it should run periodically and clean the cache or expire old data. Each cache should exist for specific reasons, triggers and expirations so a routine clean up imposed by any OS uniformly on all caches would be a bad design depiction and constrain the usefulness of caches in general.\nIn specific don’t see macOS ever cleaning ~/Library or /Library cache folders either. I can’t be sure it’s not cleaning at a time I don’t see or just leaving my stuff there alone. There could be low disk space triggers that do clean there and I just don’t run my machines to trigger that occasional cleanup or emergency cleanup if the OS is about to run out of all space.\nThere are triggers where the OS will just kill running processes when there is no memory, so only Apple could tell you if they have any circumstances where this would be cleaned.\n\nA: I think the answer is at https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/AccessingFilesandDirectories/AccessingFilesandDirectories.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH3-SW11\nIt suggests that the OS does not periodically clear files in the cache folder.   But the OS \"may\" clear files in the \"temp\" folder.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete the original admin user after creating a new one? I have a MBP running Mojave that I got from a colleague.

And John will not need that account anymore.\nIf I create a new user, \"Chris\", can I safely delete the old user, /Users/john folder and everything else?\nMy instinct is that it should be completely fine, but I want to make sure there isn't anything super-special about the auto-created administrator account in macOS that I would be losing by deleting that original account.\n\nA: Yes it’s safe - you only need one admin account. You can delete all the others, just not the last one.\nChoose to keep the data or delete the data, but the accounts can all go when you don’t need them.\n", "Q: how to stop this bogon host running from my macbook? I have noticed from my macbook a new hostname is exposed with the name bogon\n\neven if I block this mac address on the router, it comes up with a new one.\nAnd  do not have any clue where is it coming from ?\nplease help.\n\nA: A bogon is an illegitimate IP address that falls into a set of IP addresses that have not been officially assigned to an entity by an internet registration institute, such as the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA). Bogons arise as a result of a misconfiguration or intentional misuse that fools recipients about its source IP address. The term bogon is used as slang and is derived from the word bogus.\nPrevention of bogons.\nMany internet service providers (ISP), firewalls and intrusion prevention systems block bogons. This can be accomplished through bogon filtering, or the practice of assigning access control lists (ACL) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) blacklists to a device. A list of bogons can be obtained from a variety of sources including HTTP, BGP peering, routing registries and the DNS.\nThis is not an unusual problem and much has been written about it here, here and here. These are commonly found as the source addresses of DDoS attacks. I don't know enough about them to do more than refer you to these sites. There are ways to prevent these from showing up on your machine.\na Google search on Bogon returns many other sites with helpful information.\n", "Q: Entering Passcode too quickly? Is there a setting or a way to have the phone accept the passcode more quickly?\nThe Problem:\nMy passcode is greater than 8 characters.  I've entered it enough times that I've become quite efficient at it.  The phone can't seem to keep up. After several attempts at ever decreasing speeds, I have to enter it at what seems 1 character per second.\nTo make sure that it's not me, we recorded me tapping in my passcode at a quick pace.  I tapped each number correctly.  Each tap highlighted the number and there was an audible \"keyboard click\".  The phone did not accept the correct passcode.  Entering the exact same passcode at a much slower rate, the phone accepted it.\nCan this behavior from the phone be adjusted?\nThe phone is an iPhone 7S running IOS 13, not jailbroken.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem. I don't see any way of adjusting or fixing this unfortunately. We just have to wait for Apple to fix this in a future release.\n", "Q: Upgrading to Catalina from Mojave stuck at \"Estimating time remaining\" for days! I was upgrading my 2015 Macbook Pro running Mojave to Catalina. It is stuck at a black screen with the Apple logo and \"Estimating time remaining\" for several days now.\nDuring that time, I hard rebooted several times out of frustration after hours of waiting, each time I got a normal-looking login window and I then input my username and password and got logged in, after which it resumed to the same black screen with the Apple logo and \"Estimating time remaining\". But the progress indicator kept at approximately the same location which is about 1/6 of the entire length. There were also a few times when the machine shut down itself and when I found out about it I pressed the power button to start it manually. After that the normal-looking login window showed up again and I then input my username and password to log in. And the same black screen with the Apple logo and \"Estimating time remaining\" show up again but the progress indicator stayed at approximately the same place. It is the third day it has been doing that now. What should I do?\n\nA: One thing you can try is to start up to your previous system and try the upgrade again. Press the option key on start and choose macOS Mojave or whatever your root volume is called. This will get you out of the recurring upgrade process.\nRegarding the login window, do you have FileVault enabled?\n\nA: After trying every possible suggestion I could find online, I managed to succeed by using Disk Utility to erase my SSD and have a fresh install.\nMy hypothesis that the file system might have been corrupted made even more sense when I found out that a particular file in the ~/Library dir would never finish copying.\n\nA: The end of the story is that I basically kept trying rebooting and allowing the installation process to retry itself and after a few days, for whatever reason, it went through and finished the installation. So it stays a mystery both why it was repeatedly stuck and why it got thorough the last time. It was a through test of my patience, I have to say.\n", "Q: Safari doesn't detect font installed on system When using Safari, I thought the font it was using in Google search pages looked different. Sure enough, Google was using the Roboto font in a Chromium-based browser, but Safari's Google still used Helvetica or something similar. What's even stranger is that I looked into the loaded webpage's CSS, and it seemed like Roboto was loaded preferentially above all other fonts.\nWhy would it be the case that Safari can't display Roboto, but Chrome can?\n\nA: I believe that the reason for its being shown only in Chrome is most likely due to Safari's anti-fingerprinting techniques, which obfuscates currently installed system fonts from websites. However, as a by-product this prevents websites from displaying webpages from using a custom font that the user installed on the system (source).\nBear in mind that websites can still display custom fonts as long as they are loaded from a source external to your local filesystem, which is why a website like Google Fonts can still function.\nNote: I am unsure why it's not possible for Safari to simply display the Roboto after the website has loaded. Surely that wouldn't reveal to the webpage host that Roboto was used, and thus installed on the system?\n", "Q: Will buying a new hardware stop my Apple TV+ subscription payment for a year?

I couldn't find any simple way to restore it :/\nHow can it be done?\n\nA: The simplest way is 'undo' i.e. ⌘+Z until you reach the desired (previous) state. 'Undo' applies to anything what is 'done' in a file, so pending on how many changes are made it may be lot of undoing.\n\nA: I would, and almost always do, two things:\n\n*\n\n*add a column numbering the items so that the original order can be restored easily - often necessary when the original data is not already in a specific order such as alphabetic etc\n\n\n*keep a copy of the original and I always work on a duplicate so when things go wrong I can return to the original. I also save prior to making changes so that I can revert to the previous state.\nThese have saved me often and apply to any spreadsheet program and other data handling programs....\n\nA: The original data was sorted by one of the columns and you need to know which. If you remember the 1st row of data you can maybe figure out which column it was sorted on. If you haven't made many changes there is an option under the File menu called \"Revert To\" which reverts the file back to how you opened it. This may be your best bet. You can revert and then figure out which column it was sorted on.\n", "Q: Will one USB-C port be able to deliver power, data transfer and power two monitors on a Macbook Pro?

I know you can do some customization through System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard, but it doesn't give you much fine control. Is there another interface or maybe even a config file one can use to hyper customize the Touch Bar?\n\nA: The following options should get your job done\nMy TouchBar My Rules\nSource is on GitHub. This Youtube video explains it's functionality\nPros: Free and Open Source, More customizations to touch bar than the next option, Adding Custom gestures (Instructions) - It's pretty easy to add custom functionality, All the functions you mentioned: Esc, F1-F12, Toggle Mute, Volume Slider, Screen-Brightness Slider are all there as default presets \\\nCons: I had a hard time installing it but type this open -e ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MTMR/items.json in the terminal and then you should be good, My friends complain it's buggy in Big Sur but I haven't upgraded yet so no opinions on that.\nBetterTouchTool\nPros: Completly customize the touch bar just like the above app, Wide range of gesture controls for Apple peripheral such as Magic Mouse and Keyboard, Big Sur Native Compatibility.\nCons: It's paid , Text Triggers are quite buggy.\nI use BetterTouchTool cause it has more customizations for the Magic Mouse and Keyboard but for your requirements, MTMR should do the job in flying colors.\n\nA: MTMR , it's free but it does need some editing to get it fully customized\n", "Q: How to browse files for uncompleted iOS backup I have an old iOS backup but it is not a complete backup (I dismounted the phone while taking it and never made a new one.)\nThere are 15GB of files but since it is not a completed backup, the Backup software is not able to browse it.\nHow I can browse these files and get some data from it?\nI used the backup tool from Finde.r\n\nA: When you take an unencrypted backup using Finder, it will generate a random name for your files or photos and remove the extension, in this case, you can't know the file type but you can try preview it or open it so if this file is an image and you tried to open it with preview then you can see the image\n", "Q: Reuse of Apple SSD in a PC I have a spare 256GB SSD from my 2015 Macbook Pro that I would like to re-use in my PC. I have an Acer laptop that comes with an M2 slot. Are adapters available that would allow me to reuse this SSD in my PC?\n\nA: Heavily edited answer:\nIn theory, the answer is yes. But as @benwiggy has pointed out in his comment, as a practical matter, the answer is: \"It depends\". Apple's proprietary design of the SSD's connector/interface means that an adapter will be needed to use it in a device with one of the industry standard M.2 interfaces. In other words, you can only re-use an Apple SSD in another machine IF you have the correct adapter. Making this still more difficult is the fact that Apple changed the SSD interface design periodically, and so the adapter required may be unique to a model or model year.\nYour question has now been closed as duplicative, but in reviewing the duplicated Q&A, it will be noted:\n\n*\n\n*that Q&A pertains to a Macbook Air early 2014 which requires a different adapter than your Macbook Pro 2015, and\n\n\n*some of the links are now broken, meaning some of the recommended adapters and sources are no longer available.\nHowever, ferreting through one of the manufacturer's websites (Sintech) provided in this answer led to this page of macbook SSD adapters which may be of some use. I saw no prices provided on Sintech's website, but another answer stated that his cost was $13.99. You can factor cost & your research time into your tradeoffs for buying a new drive vs. buying an adapter to re-use the Apple SSD. You might also want to consider the environment in your decision.\n\nA: The SSD module in a 2015 MacBook Pro uses an Apple-proprietary \"12+16-pin\" connector, which is different from the normal standard m2 connector used on Windows PC computers.\nThere is a market for adaptors that allow the fitting of generic m2 blades into a Mac's 12+16 socket; but I suspect that adaptors going the other way will be rare.\nYou can buy 256 GB m2 modules for less money than an adaptor is likely to cost you, even if you find one.\n", "Q: My new 2020 MacBook Pro is getting very hot I got this laptop roughly a week ago and have not used it for anything too computationally extensive as of yet. Using it on Zoom has got my laptop incredibly hot, yet the use on my CPU doesn't peak about 20% according to activity monitor.\nIs this a defective laptop, or is it just how they usually work?\n\nA: Using any teleconferencing software (Zoom, Google Meet, Cisco WebEx) puts a heavy load on the CPU and the GPU processing the video stream. My 2019 MBA's fans ramp up and the Mac gets hot when participating in a Zoom with 10 people.\nMy iMac at home, with a dedicated GPU and a very fast Core i9 CPU, shakes it off and barely breaks a sweat, even in Zoom calls with many more participants.\nWhich 2020 MBP are you using? The 13\" does not have a dedicated GPU, whilst the 16\" has an additional AMD Radeon Pro GPU of various flavours, depending on the build.\n\nA: \nIs this a defective laptop, or is it just how they usually work?\n\nIt's impossible to tell judging by the single performance metrics of single application in a singular environment.  However, IMO, Zoom is a blatant security disaster from the get go:\n\n*\n\n*routing calls through servers in China\n\n*atrocious privacy ah\\nd security (also linked to China)\n\n*Flawed encryption gives access to webcam and microphones\n\n*LinkedIn Back door\nThe devs at Zoom seem to be focusing on a lot (as in a sh*t ton more - it's a metric value) on just what private data they can see what they can abscond with.\n\nIs this a defective laptop, or is it just how they usually work?\n\nMore than likely not. Note, that I'm not saying it's impossible for a defect to sneak through quality control; it can happen.  However, with Zoom on your plate, I would tale a long hard look at that that software and why you have it installed.  However, I heed these words of wisdom from some of the investment gurus:\n\n\nIn the mornings I have  Maria Bartiromo and Dagen McDowell (major crush on her) as well as the the folks from CNBC Squawk Box (Becky Quick and Joe Kermam.  All have a short term bullish outlook on the stock but as contrarians, they all think it's going to get hammered for it's lackadaisical approach to security.  As Dagan put it (paraphrasing) \"I will not Zoom now or ever,  I won't connect with anyone who does, - I don't care if you're a business colleague or or family- it's not happening.\n\n\nOn a more technical note, I use Skype and it doesn’t put any load on my CPU or GPU.  Likewise fir Cisco, WebEx, and even Citrix GotoMeeting. I have a disposable Android phone for WhatsApp (Facebook is another nefarious data collection company) and no other app  consume CPU resources like Zoom does.  The best advice I can give you is to avoid it at all costs.\n", "Q: Karabiner not repeating shell command in \"to_if_held_down\" block I want to map my mouse button 5 such that option + button 5 skips to the next track if pressed once, and if held down it continuously skips forward by 10 seconds.\nI've added the following rule to Karabiner:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Mouse Button Remapping\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Maps option + button 5 to next track\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"pointing_button\": \"button5\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"option\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to_if_alone\": [\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"rewind\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"to_if_held_down\": [\n            {\n              \"shell_command\": \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Spotify\\\" to player position' | awk '{ print $1 - 10 }' | xargs -I {} osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Spotify\\\" to set player position to {}'\",\n              \"repeat\": true\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFor some reason though, when I hold down option + button 5, the track will skip forward 10 seconds just once.\nThe weird thing is, if I replace the shell_command in the to_if_held_down block to just be \"key_code\" : \"rewind\", then a ton of rewind events are sent to Spotify.\nIs there a configuration option I'm missing?\nFWIW I'm also running bearded spice such that all media key events are sent solely to Spotify.\n\nA: The Karabiner-Elements documentaion for \"to.repeat\" explains:\nThe default value is true.\nThe key repeating will be suppressed if to.repeat is false. \n\nObviously a \"repeat: true\" line is pointless – you cannot \"enforce\" a repetition; it's default anyway.\nBut more important for your script:\n\"shell_command\" unfortunately is NOT a \"key\" – \"rewind\" IS a key.\nTherefore, \"shell_command\" can not be repeated by holding the original \"from-key\".\nAnd: in any sequence of \"key_code\"s only the last one would be repeated (see link above).\nI was pointed to the reason for this behaviour by little-big-h (github.com):\nI found the code that makes karabiner send a key-up event before sending \nthe next key-down event in a sequence. It can be disabled using this patch. \n\nHis patch requires you to compile Karabiner-Elements from source code; that's too much for me … sorry.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina (mid-2014) shutdowns with -128 code I have a Mid 2014 Macbook Pro, which was just serviced at Apple (battery replacement). While they were replacing the battery they cocked up the main board with CPU, RAM etc and replaced that for free. Here I thought - nice service, I got my old CPU/RAM replaced, almost like new my Macbook! :D\nObvisouly in the shop no issues were present for the n-minutes I examined it. Home, under a week of usage, started shutting down in a most peculiar way:\n\n*\n\n*Screen goes black, but still remains backlit for 30 or so seconds.\n\n*Then the laptop fully shuts down\n\nNo apparent reason was found. So I went throught SMC and the memory reset procedures - no luck. Apples startup diagnostics alaso did not show anything.\nLooking at shutdown logs I get latest a kernel panic with code -128 (RAM issues?):\nkernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: -128\nSo I wonder wtf is actually happening. I manage to write this entry while in safe mode, could it be a software issue still? Not likely installing unreal engine and quixel mixer caused the cockup... But am at a loss if -128 can influence that in any way.\nAny tips? (Not sure if Apple provides warranty on repairs in case it is an actual RAM issue)\n\nA: Here is a post suggesting disabling the Thunderbolt Ethernet Driver solves the issue.\nAnother post suggests the nocrashmbp utility which says 2013-2015 MacBook Pros are susceptible:\n\nThe CPU has several power states and voltages.  Some CPUs have become unstable at the extremely low voltage on one of it's cores.   The CPU will sometimes briefly dip into that power state, and if it happens to be on the core wherein it is unstable you will see the “silent” crash.  Screen goes black, a few seconds later it dies completely.  This condition was observed with external test equipment, as well as through internal cpu voltage monitoring.\n\n", "Q: Restricting/Blocking iPhone access with a passcode for workers? I would like to implement an app that is capable of doing the following when a worker doesn’t return the iPhone for 45 days:\n\n*\n\n*Based on IMEI or a unique app client id the phone should be disabled with a random passcode, by bypassing the faceid or touch id.\n\n*It should not be enabled until allowed from backend admin end.\n\n*The iOS should not be overwritten while the app is enabled.\n\nI would like to seek advice if this software exists?\n\nA: Apps can not do this on iOS due to how the OS restricts an app to the sandbox.

When I rebooted my MBP (Catalina), I got this error message\n\nWhen I jumped into the System Preferences, this is what I see\n\nIt does not give me a lot of information where the extension comes from.\nHow can I identify which extension it is? If I can identify it, then I will know if I still need it or not.\n\nA: Here is an easy way to identify which kernel extension is causing this MacOS blocking of its install.\nWhen you are on the Security & Privacy System Preferences… telling you:\nSystem software from developer \"Google, Inc.\" was blocked\nfrom loading.\n\njust select Allow once just to be able to get its real name and not to keep it installed.\nThen let the complete boot of MacOS terminate, and open a Terminal or xterm.\nEnter the following command to extract from all your kernel extensions the one which developer might be Google with:\n/usr/bin/sudo kextstat | egrep -i '(^Index|google)'\n\nThe 6th field of output of this command is the bundle name under which this extension is registered in the MacOS kernel.\nLet's say for this example its name is:\ncom.google.kext.foo\n\nNext go to:\ncd /Library/Extensions\n\nand search for this bundle name within all the Google looking directories:\ngrep 'com.google.kext.foo' [gG]oogle*/Contents/Info.plist\n\nThen if Google made its job of developer correctly you should be able to find on the web what this extension id doing.\nAnd you will know if you need it or not.\nIf you want to keep it within your /Library/Extensions but not loaded within MacOS, just reboot.\nInvestigation closed.\n\nA: Having spent some time with Google, the only reference I see to a kernel extension is Google File Stream.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/27765/google-file-stream-team-id\n\n\n*https://macadmins.co.il/2019/01/21/macos-security-secure-kernel-extension-loading-skel/\nThis would make sense, as Dropbox also wants to install a kernel extension for what it does. I believe Dropbox’s “Smart Sync” feature requires it, and I believe Google has a similar feature for what used to be called “Google Drive”.\nHowever, if you do not use Smart Sync with Dropbox, you don’t need the kernel extension.\nUnfortunately I don’t know enough about Google File Stream to know what features might rely on the kernel extension, but perhaps this will give you a start in looking for more information.\n", "Q: How do i fix my MacBook Pro 13 from malware attack? On opening Safari it takes me to Yahoo and I have tried to clear extensions yet it doesn't work. Now,  I can't see any extensions under it's tab as well.\n\nA: Nothing you’ve described indicates malware...\n\nOn opening Safari it takes me to Yahoo...\n\nMine takes me to Bing. I have my home page and default search engine set to Bing, so this is normal. Check to see what yours are set to.\n\nI have tried to clear extensions yet it doesn't work.\n\nWhich extensions? What doesn’t work, Safari or the extension?\n\nNow I can't see any extensions under it's tab as well.\n\nYou just stated you tried to clear them out, if you did that, there won’t be any listed.\nIt’s very unlikely it’s malware.  If you are downloading and installing every piece of software you run into, then yes, you probably are infected in some way.\nI personally use a Synology NAS with AV built into it.   As for AV, I actually don’t use on my \"production\" machine because I'm very, very particular about what gets installed.  However, with a new app, I will usually test it out on a VM with AV, or on an old “scrap” Mac and with APFS snapshots enabled. I take a snap before I make changes prior to installation.  If the application is malware, garbagewae, or spyware (i.e. a Font program that wants access to GPS and contacts) I roll back to a previous snapshot like it never happened.\nNow, with all that said, there’s an AV company, I’ve got my eye on - PC Matic (yeah, those guys).  What I like is that they have a white/blacklist model.  If the app is not on the whitelist, it’s not going to run; even legit ones!  So, it really locks things down, but if you’re in a rush to do a  demo of some new software and have whitelisted it, you are up the proverbial creek.\nPersonally, I think  it might be a strong supplement to Gatekeeper; more testing needs to be done, though.\n\nA: There is an app called Malwarebytes which scans your mac for malware and other types of software such as a virus. This app is not free but comes with a 14-day trial. You can test it to clean up your Mac and see if you want to purchase it. It's around $40 for a yearly license. The exact pricing is given in the link above.\nThis app has been long recognized as fair and useful. Not all malware cleaners are legitimate or effective. This one is specifically both.\n", "Q: 2019 MacBook Pro 16\" T2 Security Chip question Dont have much to go on here, but im curious to hear anything from those who might have some ideas.  So for the past 4 days my computer has been at an apple authorized service center and authorized reseller for service in hammond, la for repeating keyboard letters and password mismatch issues - my user password seems to be different for login vs password used for user preferences.  They should be the same.  The service center has been telling me that they have been unable to \"access\" the system in order to run diagnostics or do firmware update.  \"The system wont let us do it\".\nFor those who might be familiar with how premium apple authorized service centers are run, shouldnt they after 4 days have been able to access an ulocked system in order to diagnose?\n\nA: Mac computers with the T2 chip have a feature known as Secure Boot, which prevents booting from external drives. It will need to be turned off using your admin password.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208330\nPreviously, Apple techs would boot to their own disks in order to run diagnostic checks and test that everything works on a known system.\nObviously, it would be worthless security if Apple had a way to get round it, but you'd think that Apple support staff would be prepared for this by now.\nMy first guess (without inspection) for the password issue is that one password is required to unlock the FileVault encrypted disk at startup, and another one is the user account's password that you need to authenticate and unlock System Prefs, etc.\nOther possibilities are: a firmware password, required when the machine is turned on; or you are loggin in as a 'Standard' user, and you need the password of an 'Admin' user to authorize things like installing and the padlock in System Prefs.\n\nA: So for the past 4 days my computer has been at an apple authorized service center and authorized reseller for service in Hammond, LA for repeating keyboard letters and password mismatch issues - my user password seems to be different for login vs password used for user preferences. They should be the same. The service center has been telling me that they have been unable to \"access\" the system in order to run diagnostics or do firmware update. \"The system wont let us do it\".\nThere’s a simple way to gain access to the system snd that would be giving them your firmware password and/or FileVault encryption key.\n\nmy user password seems to be different for login vs password used for user preferences.\n\nInteresting, as there’s only one Authentication mechanism when logging on or validation of your identity when you want to make a change you your system.\nNow, let’s assume fir a moment that your top case (the keyboard and trackpad) decided to stop working.  You can still still hook up an external USB mouse and keyboard and enter your authentication credentials.   You may need to disconnect the top case from the USB bus, but it doesn’t take 4 days.\nMy advice is to find a more reputable vendor even if you have to send it out of state\n\nA: After 4 days, I would ask them to send it to Apple or return it. Sounds like their ability to explain service delays is lacking. Unless they explained you a path and you didn’t OK them to erase it / begin the unlocking - then it’s on you.\n", "Q: Cheapest mac for latest xcode? I am doing a uni course which is called iPhone Software Engineering and it says that I need a mac that is able to run latest version of 'Xcode' for app developement and current SWIFT and the Apple iOS SDK will be used.

I can export a single playlist from iTunes to m3u format easily enough, but is there any way to do it en masse? I have about 40 playlists and it's exceedingly tedious to do it for all of them one at a time. I know you can dump the entire library database if you're just switching between macs but I use these all over the place. That library file is megabytes and megabytes and while I could conceivably reconstruct my playlists from the xml plist it's not ideal.\n\nA: Just using iTunes by itself, I do not know of a way to export multiple playlists at the same time, as one can only select one playlist in the Sidebar at a time.\nNormally to export a playlist in iTunes one would, e.g., select the target playlist in the Sidebar and then click: File > Library > Export Playlist…\nThis then brings up a Save dialog box, e.g.:\n\nTo semi-automate the process I assigned a keyboard shortcut of ⌘E to the Export Playlist… in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, as shown the image below.\nThis allows me to easily bring up the Save dialog box without having to navigate the menus, and I can then just use the keyboard to easily walk through saving one playlist after the other.\nIt's easy to get into a rhythm, select the first playlist, then ⌘E > enter > down-arrow > ⌘E > enter > down-arrow > etc.\n\n\nTo further semi-automate the process, you can use a bit of AppleScript in Script Editor.\nExample AppleScript code:\nactivate application \"iTunes\"\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat 1 times\n        keystroke \"e\" using command down\n        delay 0.5\n        key code 36 # return key\n        delay 0.5\n        key code 125 # down-arrow key   \n        delay 0.5\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nChange repeat 1 times to the number of times you want it to repeat.\nThen in iTunes select the first playlist on the Sidebar and then run the script from Script Editor.\nThis example AppleScript code assumes you've already once selected the Where: and Format: and will use the default names in the Save As:, none of which are the same, and there are no playlists currently at the Where: that would interfere with the limited example AppleScript code. Otherwise, additional coding will be necessary.\nIf you want to use the example AppleScript code without assigning a keyboard shortcut for the Export Playlist… command, then in place of keystroke \"e\" using command down use:\n    click menu item \"Export Playlist…\" of ¬\n        menu \"Library\" of ¬\n        menu item \"Library\" of ¬\n        menu \"File\" of ¬\n        menu bar item \"File\" of ¬\n        menu bar 1 of ¬\n        application process \"iTunes\"\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: Here my applescript with some changes because the down-arrow key approach was not working very well.\nactivate application \"Music\"\ndelay 1\n\ntell application \"Music\"\n    set playlistArray to (get name of every playlist)\n\n    # Foreach playlist...\n    repeat with currPlaylist in playlistArray\n\n        if ( (currPlaylist as string) is not equal to \"Libreria\" and (currPlaylist as string) is not equal to \"Musica\" ) then\n            say currPlaylist\n            tell application \"Music\"\n                # Set the current playlist in the sidebar\n                set the view of the front browser window to playlist (currPlaylist as string)\n                delay 1\n\n                # Start export\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    keystroke \"e\" using command down            # it's necessary to have set the shortcut CMD+E\n                    delay 2                                     # delay in seconds\n                    key code 36                                 # simulation return key\n                    delay 2\n                end tell\n\n            end tell\n\n            delay 0.5\n        end if\n        \n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nTo execute it from the terminal: osascript ~/Desktop/automate_export_playlist.scpt\n", "Q: What makes macOS 11 Big Sur supported on a 2013 MacPro and not a 2012? In the past, older Mac Pro machines have not been supported by newer macOS releases due to standard features on the machine (e.g. Bluetooth wasn't standard on 2008s, limiting Sierra) or by CPU extensions (SSE 4.2 required for Mojave). With the announcement of Big Sur, Apple states that you must have a 2013 \"trash can\" Mac Pro or later leaving the older cheese graters behind.\nWhat is it about the 2013 that would prevent Big Sur from running on a 2012 Westmere or even back to a MacPro4,1? One of the benefits of having a Mac Pro was that you could upgrade the Bluetooth and GPU modules and this is how we got (say) a 2008 machine to work all the way up to High Sierra and even Mojave if you were brave enough. But those upgrades aside, I believe the CPUs of a 2012 and 2013 supported the same features so I'm wondering if there is something else?\n\nA: As to the reason why Apple chose this exact model as the cut-off point for support cannot be answered by anyone but Apple. Everything else is just speculation.\nThere exists an non-official guide on how to install the Big Sur beta on the older 2010/2012 Mac Pro's (amongst others):\nhttps://parrotgeek.com/bigsur/\nNote that because this is non-official, it might not work or exhibit problems. Also it might only work for the current beta, and not when you get to the final release of Big Sur.\nAs indicated in this guide, the built-in WiFi does not and there could be issues related to sleep mode. This could hint at why Apple does not support this model - i.e. having to support these older WiFi chipsets.\n\nA: On a technical level, the installer has to have all the drivers needed to make the hardware boot, so the installer will check and abort if the model is not on the white list of eligible gear. Also, Apple may have run the code on the drivers and found they lacking entirely and had an estimate to support it that didn’t match expectations.\nOn a program management level, Apple has to spend time testing each release against a fleet of hardware so they can test everything. That money and time is surely reviewed to determine the costs to support older hardware.\nFinally, on an experience level, Apple has to measure how the software performs and decide if they can even support the new code running on hardware that may not execute code as fast for whatever reason (drivers, latency, CPU features) and might decide the experience isn’t going to be good or they would rather invest money and time elsewhere.\nIn the end, only Apple can know what and why the decided this, but I’m sure people will figure ways to hack gear that’s not officially supported, but the official support moniker means a lot for some so it’s worth checking your requirements before you upgrade.\n", "Q: Avoid default fullscreen (no header, no dock) Since time ago and after upgrading I realize that macOS began abusing of fullscreen feature, and personally I hate this behaviour.\n\n*\n\n*Maximize icon goes to fullscreen (hides window header and dock)\n\n\n*Maximize icon, keeping pressed offer tile to left and tile to right, but not and option to fit to screen\n\n\n*Exit fullscreen (from Menu;View) moves to a small windows and does't fit the window to the screen\nFrom system preferences I can't see any option about the fullscreen behaviour.\nAt the moment of writing I am on macOS Catalina.\n\nA: I don't think there is any way to change the default behaviour, but you can return to the older Maximise functionality by  Opt ⌥   clicking the green dot.\nThis will not always fill the entire screen, but has the old switchable behaviour that you might be used to, first click enlarges, second click returns to last state.\nThis older functionality is still also available in the Dock prefs - Double-click a window's title bar to… zoom\nThis is the same as  Opt ⌥  green dot.\nIf you do want to completely fill the screen without being actually 'fullscreen' then  Opt ⌥  double-clicking any corner of the window, when you see the diagonal arrows appear on hover,  will expand to completely fill the screen - but it will not return on a second click & will also sometimes 'forget' the last size if you  Opt ⌥   click the green dot afterwards.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Headphone constantly disconnecting Recently I bought a new pair of headphones, a JBL Everest Elite 150nc (with noise cancelling).

It’s far less setup than imaging to USB and far better in terms of speed, security and in lining the latest firmware and OS updates effortlessly.\nIf you have even less time per machine to get the erase rolling, hire an Automaton and some inexpensive software to accelerate your erase and install.\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/mds-admin-guide-version-2/\n\nSo in terms of time for technician interaction with the Mac, it takes just a few seconds to plug in the Automaton and the external drive, hold the option key to start the startup selector, and then return a few minutes later to disconnect the Automaton and external volume. This can dramatically reduce setup time and result in large savings of time and labor costs.\n\nThe Mac software is free and you can get professional / MDM support if you need that level of help.\nhttps://twocanoes.com/products/mac/mac-deploy-stick/\nThe hardware is $40 if you need 5 helpers. You won’t need either the hardware or the support if you’re a small shop and Apple and Two Canoes give away the network setup software for free that does what you mention on your Windows option.\nI list the prices since it’s very reasonable, but all the software from Two Canoes is open source, free and you only pay if you want to support them or need professional support. I am a happy customer of both Apple and Two Canoes - so consider that disclosure if that helps.\n", "Q: Any way to make symlinks or aliases resolve over a network with macOS? So I like to move my big folders from the home folder on the macOS System SSD to a hard drive and keep the SSD mainly for the system files and apps, a fairly common practice.\nProblem is when I want to access the home folder over a network, if I use aliases I get..\nFoo can't be open because the original item can't be found.\n\nOr for symlinks..\nThe operation can’t be completed because the original item for “Bar” can’t be found.\n\nAlas hard links don't appear to be usable for directories.\nBut once when doing this I appear to have stumbled upon a method of linking that did resolve over a network, but I don't have that install anymore so can't check.\nIs there a way to move and link folders that will resolve when accessing said folders from another Mac on the same network?\nIt's also no fun that if these are added back to the sidebar as aliases, files can't be dragged into them.\n\nA: So the answer is that both aliases and symlinks are both respected over network so long as the a share is mounted that contains the path to the original file in Finder i.e now has an eject button.\nIn my case I'd symlinked from an SSD to a HD, and while the SSD share folder was mounted, I had not yet browsed to any place on the HD so it was not mounted.\n", "Q: How can I differentiate between a broken iPad power button and some sort of software problem? Pressing the power button on my iPad mini 4 doesn't turn the screen on and off... but a long press on the button will still bring up the \"slide to power off\" prompt (and if I power off the iPad, pressing the power button will turn it back on ).\nIf nothing worked at all I would figure it's a hardware problem and look into getting it repaired, but the fact the the \"power off\" feature works even though the power button doesn't seem to sleep/wake the screen has me puzzled.\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: There is an issue with the display lock sensor and/or flex cable.\nI do remember seeing this on several occasions and this is a hardware issue with the sensor or flex cable from that sensor.  When you have a smart cover, it's that sensor in conjunction with a magnet that turns off the display (sleeps the iPad). What's happening is the sensor is faulty and \"tricking\" the iPad into thinking it's still open and it doesn't turn off.\nYou'll have to take it in for service.\nWorkaround:  Change the Display Lock\nGo to Settings → Display & Brightness then check to see if the Lock/Unlock is enabled.  If so, turn it off.  Obviously, if you have a smart cover it won't work any more.\nIf you're not using a smart cover, then the issue is technically moot - you can use the button to put it to sleep or wait until the autosleep (timer) put's it to sleep for you.\n\nA: That's not the way it works on my iPad Pro.  Pressing the Power button turns the iPad display off and on. Holding it down for a few seconds brings up the shutdown slider. If you can't turn the display off and on what do you do when screen turns off? Press the Home button? Really only thing you're missing, it sounds, is your ability to turn the screen off when you desire. Or did I miss something? You can turn the screen on with the Home button.\nIt sounds as if something may be wrong with your button.\n", "Q: How do you replace commands in the terminal? I want to be able to type a short command and have that be replaced with a longer one. For example, typing vscode could run something like open -a \"Visual Studio Code\". I know this is possible in Linux, but is there any way to do this in MacOS?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You should be able to do the same as your were doing in Linux in macOS.\nAs an example, if using bash, adding\nalias vscode=\"open -a 'Visual Studio Code'\"\n\nto your .bash_profile file will let you just type vscode in Terminal  to open Visual Studio Code.\n\nNote: If you are running macOS Catalina, or later, and have not installed a more recent version of bash and are using the default zsh shell, then put aliases in your ~/.zprofile, or the appropriate file for the shell you are running.\nAlso, you might want to read Visual Studio Code on macOS to add the code executable to your PATH or path, depending on your shell.\n\nA: You could write a series of 1 line scripts and make them executable. In your example, a script named vscode would contain the one line you describe above. then you could\nchmod +x vscode\nand then just type vscode and return to run it.\n", "Q: Global Shortcut To Open Safari Is there a way to set a global shortcut Key to Open Safari in Mac OS?\n\nA: After doing a bit more research I found this video on Youtube which provides a simple easy to implement solution. https://youtu.be/oR8FsCQQH9Y\n", "Q: I have a problem about Backup and Sync in mac big sur?

Am I likely to have this problem using this with a Mac mini?\n\nA: The 2018 Mac mini can output two displays at 4096 x 2304 from its Thunderbolt connectors, and one 4096 x 2160 display via its HDMI port.\nSo a single 3840 x 2160 display is well within its capabilities.\nThe mini has 2 USB A ports, but 4 Thunderbolt ports, which also provide USB C. You could use a USB C to A adaptor or cable to connect a USB device.\nI have a mini with an Anker 7-port USB hub, and that powers both my iPhone and external USB drives. My iPad, however, does not charge through the hub. Keyboard and mouse take minimal power. You might want to connect the drive to the mini directly, and the hub to the 2nd USB A port.\nMost hubs do come with an optional power supply, but I would expect that would only be needed for multiple high-power devices.\n", "Q: Send batch emails from terminal with attachments I would like to write a bash script that does the following:\n\n*\n\n*Read from an excel file a column of email addresses\n\n*For each email address (say person1@wherever) attach an associated file (say person1.xlsx) and send email with standard body.\n\nIn parts I have most of what I need except the mail bit doesn't seem to work for me.

For this to work, you need to download the Installer app onto your main Mac, run the script to create the disk image and then run Parallels with that image to create a Big Sur VM.\nPerformance may be rather unsatisfactory though, you might be better off with installing Big Sur on an external drive or separate partition, and boot from there.\n", "Q: How can I log edits to the hosts file?

I have files in, for example, ~/Downloads/music that I'd like to have on my iPhone's local music library. Is it possible to do this via Finder or some Terminal command, rather than having to connect a USB cable and use iTunes? Maybe something with Airdrop? Finder also has a \"Quick Actions\" command if you right-click a file, is there an extension that would do this?\n\nA: There isn’t a filesystem based local library on iOS. You will want to put it into Files app and use a different player if you really need to play files from an arbitrary box of files.\n\n*\n\n*Files.app can play most songs without needing an app.\n\nIt multitasks and I have some FM radio recordings that are 2-3 hours long and they play amazingly well from Files app. I don‘t want these in my iTunes library so even though I’m all in with Apple Music and a cloud library - I have some esoteric stuff and audio books, lecture notes, radio performances I choose to store in the filesystem. Files on demand from iCloud works so well for my case I encourage anyone to try that.\nIs there a reason why you’re using Music app and not syncing the libraries via Apple Music? Same question for using iCloud to sync files same as box.com / Dropbox / google and other file sync options between macOS and iOS.\nIt’s easy to automate moving files on macOS with services, folder actions and more, the problem here is Basically to chose a different player that works with files dumped in a directory as opposed to adding them to a music library that then syncs.\nYou are among some very smart and sophisticated People that have this understandable misconception about Photos / movies / books / music. Without an insight into how the ecosystem is designed, people revert to dumping files in a folder and hoping the apps read from a filesystem. No judgement, but this is a common request for something Apple design rejected about a decades ago as a sub-optimal experience on the platform. Since then Apple has doubled down time and time again on managed libraries and incremental sync. You don’t have to buy in to that, just find apps that buy in to how you like to store your data.\n", "Q: Existing 3rd party software migration Did Apple mention/provide a way to upgrade existing 3rd party software once systems with the new CPU are released or are we expected to buy from scratch? Does anyone remember how they handled this during transition to Intel?\n\nA: Two notable differences between 'old' Rosetta and 'new' Rosetta are:\n\n*\n\n*Rosetta 2 will 'pre-compile' its translation before the app is launched. The old Rosetta would 'translate' PPC code to Intel anew each time the app was executed.\n\n\n*PPC CPUs were 'Big-endian' (the order in which multi-byte words were stored), whereas Intel and ARM chips are both 'little-endian'. That removes one of the major headaches and causes of problems in translation.\n\nA: To the end user, Apple will be doing it the same way as they did for the transition to Intel.\nNew apps will be released with effectively, 'two apps in one' - originally known as a fat binary or Universal app - which can run on either platform. Legacy apps will run under an invisible translator, originally known as Rosetta & now, unsurprisingly as Rosetta 2. Universal will be, by the same token, Universal 2.\nThere's Apple's main press notification at Apple announces Mac transition to Apple silicon but The Verge has a more consumer-friendly explanation\n\nThat’s where Rosetta 2 comes in: It’s an emulator built into macOS Big\nSur that will enable ARM Macs to run old Intel apps. Rosetta 2\nessentially “translates” instructions that were written for Intel\nprocessors into commands that Apple’s chips can understand. Developers\nwon’t need to make any changes to their old apps; they’ll just work.\n(The original Rosetta was released in 2006 to facilitate Apple’s\ntransition from PowerPC to Intel. Apple has also stated that it will\nsupport x86 Macs “for years to come,” as far as OS updates are\nconcerned. The company shifted from PowerPC to Intel chips in 2006,\nbut ditched support for the former in 2009; OS X Snow Leopard was\nIntel-only.)\nRosetta 2 will allow apps built for Intel chips\nto run on Apple’s new processors without any work from the developer\nYou don’t, as a user, interact\nwith Rosetta; it does its work behind-the-scenes. “Rosetta 2 is mostly\nthere to minimize the impact on end-users and their experience when\nthey buy a new Mac with Apple Silicon,” says Angela Yu, founder of the\nsoftware-development school App Brewery. “If Rosetta 2 does its job,\nyour average user should not notice its existence.”\n\n", "Q: Text Edit - Save RTFD as RTF As per my understanding the file format RTFD > RTF > TXT file i.e. a text file can hold a subset of content and formatting compared to RTF and similarly RTF can hold a subset of content and formatting compared to RTFD.\nI can save an RTF file as TXT file by going to Format -> Make Plain Text. Of course I would lose some formatting because txt file can only have a subset of RTF file formatting\nSimilarly, I want to save an RTFD as an RTF file even though I will loose some formatting that an RTFD can support but RTF cannot. But I am not able to find an option in TextEdit to save an Untitled file as .RTF file. I think the content present in the untitled file has some RTFD related formatting. So when I try to do File -> Hold option key -> Save as then I cannot find an option to save the untitled file as RTF. How Do I save the file as .RTF file using TextEdit even though I am fine with loosing the extra formatting?\n\nA: The RTFD format is actually a package format that allows it to have related files attached, like images. If your document has any files attached, you will not be able to save it as a straight RTF.\nTry right clicking on your RTFD file and select \"Show Package Contents\" and you will see the contents: the \"core\" RTF file is usually named TXT.RTF and the other files also present.\nYou can actually grab the RTF straight out of the Package without even going through saving it manually via TextEdit.app.\n", "Q: Can you programatically tell if the webcam is in use? I'm trying to run some commands when I start and stop using the (built in) webcam on my 2015 iMac running Catalina.\nIt sounds like historically lsof | grep \"AppleCamera\" would once tell me if the webcam is being used. However I'm not getting that to work on Catalina, is there an alternative process name or other method I can use to tell if the webcam is active?\n\nA: I would recommend OverSight because it's free and written by a very talented Apple technology focused security researcher.

For the past couple of months, I have been dealing with a lot of issues with safari, most typically the constant freezing watching videos on youtube and on Netflix. For instance, when I consider pausing a video and it stays paused for a while and then getting back to the video to unpause, just to see the video isn't playing anymore. Currently, I am deciding between being patient and dealing with the freezing or taking it to the apple store. However, given the new Big Sur update is gonna bring big changes to safari, should I just be patient till September until the new update comes out or in other words, should I expect the Big Sur update resolve my freezing issue with safari?\n\nA: The first thing to do is work out whether this is a known problem with the OS that's affecting all or a significant group of users, or a problem that is specific to your computer.\nI have found this report, which details problems with video freezing:\nhttps://mrmacintosh.com/2020-002-update-causes-some-macs-to-freeze-when-using-hw-accelerated-video/\nthough this suggests that the latest Mojave and Catalina updates should fix it.\nThere should be one more update to Catalina before the release of Big Sur. Brand new OS releases may fix old bugs, but they often bring new ones too, so you may have to choose between which bugs you want to keep. ;-)\nIf it's a problem specific to your computer, rather than a bug in the OS itself, then a new OS may have no effect at all, and you need to identify the cause of the problem by looking a crash logs, and testing in a new user account or in Safe boot mode.\nYou may want to try using a different web browser, though that may not help if it is a bug in the OS.\n", "Q: Siri will not understand one particular word I say and its driving me nuts In Australia one of our major supermarkets is Coles and I have their app.\nEverytime I say the word \"Coles\" Siri interprets it as \"Kohls\" so it can not find the app or the shopping list or ANYTHING associated with Coles.\nNo matter what weird and wonderful pronunciations I have tried she just keeps hearing Kohls.\nEven as I say it I can see she sometimes puts Coles in the speech bubble but then it is auto changed to Kohls.\nApart from many other issues minor but irritating with her this one really is annoying.\nHow can I retrain her?\n\nA: Man, I understand your problem - even I used to have similar problems. But you can try this trick for short words.\nInstead of pronouncing the whole word, just read out the letters. For example, instead of Coles, spell C-O-L-E-S and it works just fine. I know this isn’t the best solution, but it works fine for short words. Also, try changing the Siri language to UK English, it works a lot better according to me.\n\nA: Tell Siri to \"learn how to pronounce coles\" or if she has mispronounced it already, you can say, \"That's not how you say that.\"\nSiri will quickly get over any embarrassment and ask, \"OK, how do you pronounce the name (coles)?\" Say the name correctly, and Siri will listen and offer you a few pronunciation choices. You can play each option and select the one that sounds the best.\n**\nFirst add the coles contact\n**\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 16\" battery drains overnight I've had this Mac on Catalina 10.15.5 for a few weeks now and suddenly noticed this battery drain overnight.

But iOS browsers don't support extensions. So is it even possible?\nEDIT: Also, is it possible to get rid of \"recommendations\", i.e. videos on home page and sidebar? I would like to watch only channels I am subscribed, but sometimes I am too weak and cann't struggle against temptation to watch \"recommended\" stuff which leads to lots of wasted time. On desktop I have empty home page and no sidebar thanks to browser extension so I see only videos I need on subscribed channels. Is it possible on iPad?\n\nA: Yes (sometimes - and no, sometimes). Nothing will be able to block everything Google and YouTube throws at you long term. Short term, you can very likely get excellent relief from some and perhaps all that irritates you or erodes your privacy while you consume their content and avoid their advertising.\niOS has content blockers that work equivalently to an extension, but differently than extension due to OS architecture.\nSince iOS is sandboxed and inter-app communication and code injection are much more restricted than on macOS, you’ll want to try a few of the commercially available blockers and perhaps try your hand at writing one if you are so inclined. It’s free to write these with Xcode and install your app on your device.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker\nI use FireFox rarely on iOS and I pay for and benefit greatly from OneBlocker. Brave browser is great. Lastly, consider removing google as your search engine on every last device in your home network. Use Duck Duck Go for a while and you’ll see less targeted advertisements. You may or may not like that, tbh, but over time it can help immensely without resorting to something like https://pi-hole.net/ .\n\n*\n\n*https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1blocker-for-safari/id1365531024\n\n*https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-private-web-browser/id1052879175\n\n*https://DuckDuckGo.com\nIt does a marvelous job on YouTube as does adding the request for no cookies to the URL for YouTube. Just keep in mind, google makes billions in getting you to see their ads, so it’s a bit of an arms race between people attempting to block and people attempting to track. The reality is the Surveillance-Advertising Complex is massively funded and has hired some of the best software minds of a generation to track you and boost their revenue. Until and unless regulation or cultural shift alters the balance of google, It will neither be easy nor completely effective to escape all of their efforts - but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.\n\n*\n\n*https://youtube-nocookies.com\n\n\n*https://www.cnet.com/news/youtubes-new-nocookie-feature-continues-to-serve-cookies/\n\nSince you edited in some very specific information - here’s how I block hot network questions from the side bar here on iOS using 1Blocker. You can very well do the same in YouTube if you find the tag they use to serve sidebar ads.

If the 4K already suffers a refresh rate hit, I'm concerned that a second monitor will either push it into slide-show territory, or not work at all. Obviously resolutions can be reduced, but that's a deal-breaker for me.\nSo, would 2014 Mac minis be able to drive both a 4K (3840x2160) monitor and a 2K (1920x1080) monitor simulataneously? Additionally, would the 4K monitor maintain 30Hz in this configuration?\n\nA: It seems, from the spec you've listed, that it should support one 4K display via HDMI at 30Hz, and another display via Thunderbolt.\nHowever, everymac.com does not list the HDMI options beyond 1080p at 60 Hz.\nFor a 2014 MacBook Pro with the same Intel Iris 5100, everymac does say:\nThis model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.\n... which tallies with the similar spec from Apple for the Mini.\nI'd also draw your attention to the fact that even the 2.6 GHz i5 CPU is only a dual-core, and was considered quite 'light-purpose' at the time.\n", "Q: MBP GPU Panic-less Logic Boards I inherited a Mid-2010 15\" Macbook Pro (2.66 GHz Core i7 (I7-620M), A1286) from a relative a few years ago, and since then it started GPU-panicking (a la here, here etc). AppleCare has obviously expired, and would not be an option since they'd inevitably ask for the receipt, which I doubt my relatives would ever be able to find (10 years later). I'm fairly certain I wouldn't be able to pull off the \"make-a-fuss\" approach suggested by a lot of answerers.\nThe standard correction for this nowadays seems to be gfx.io (which is now the only software option, thanks to Apple discontinuing their software patch. Grrr). The problems with this are:-\n\n*\n\n*that this forcefully disables the nVidia adapter (shifting graphics handling onto the CPU, which is not ideal when I want to use external monitors)\n\n*that this and similar patches have not always been reliable (I have memories of it not working consistently in the past).\n\nI am aware of numerous other potential fixes (Kext purge, PRAM reset etc), but I have run through all of these at one point or another.\nAnyway, so I was thinking about the process they used when they were running the official replacement program. Although I've read in some places (comment) that it's the logic board that was replaced, this article suggests it's in fact the \"defective video card\" that is replaced. Either way, I'm assuming they just replaced the defective board with a newer revision - meaning that parts sites (like this) probably have these revised boards knocking about that won't suffer the same issue.\nConsidering the still-incredible spec and condition of this machine, I don't mind spending the money for a new logic board if it means I can reliably use macOS on it. Of course, I'm only willing to spend the money if I'm sure it will actually solve the issue.\nSo my question is two-part:\n\n*\n\n*Was it definitely the logic board that caused this fault?\n\n*What is the part number for a logic board that is known to not suffer from the GPU Panic issue (assuming it actually entered circulation)?\n\nA: I have a mid-2010 15” MBP in which the NVIDIA GPU on the original  motherboard failed, around 2014. Apple replaced the motherboard twice under their Extension Repair program, each failing after about 6 months. I put the MBP away in storage until about a month ago when I found this solution by user LangLangC: GPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen which is for a 2011 MBP using a AMD Radeon GPU, but it is the same problem, poor thermal design.\nTo make it work you need to specify the NVIDIA kext files rather than the AMD kext. There are several kext files; search for GeForce*kext and NVDA*kext. I wasn’t certain which were relevant to the GPU so I moved all these using the directions in the post. Follow the instructions of @LangLangC - they work!!!\nI have my 2010 MBP running well now using only the internal Intel GPU. One caveat is that it cannot support an external monitor. So don’t waste money on a replacement motherboard, just follow the detailed instructions in the post. Tedious but only costs time.\n\nA: The normal method of knowing a product is good is a proper return policy and warranty. Why not rely on that - buy from someone you trust to have proper buyer protections?\nThat’s a lot cheaper than being able to have all the gear and skill to test something as complicated as a processor - let alone knowing the processor works with other processors when mounted on a logic board.\nIf you’re worried about the cost of a used part, you’re really not going to like the cost of a test suite to be guaranteed your board works and paying someone to guarantee they put it in and place a warranty on their work.\n\nOn a human level, I would let go of the concept you can have anything close to Apple 2020 reliability on something they designed starting 12+ years ago and shipped in 2010. If you can source parts for pennies on the dollar and want to learn, this era hardware is a great learning place and you will learn a lot and hopefully responsible e-cycle all the parts eventually. Other than saving these parts from premature recycling or worse (like being trashed outright) is commendable, but for reliability and value - Raspberry Pi 3 and newer can’t be beat. If you need reliable macOS - you’ll need newer hardware if you can’t pool lots of parts and spend lots of time on it.\n\nFinally your answers.\n\n*\n\n*You can’t know without spending a lot of money on your failed board.\n\n*See above, except for the other board.\n\n", "Q: Erasing everything on my current I phone besides contacts I would like a fresh start and want to delete everything on my iPhone but still keep my current contacts. I just want all of my photos, notes, and everything else to be backed up on iCloud. I just logged into my iCloud account and it looks like everything is there which is good. I just do not know how to clear all the data on the phone and then ONLY get my contacts back on the phone.\nAny help would be appreciated and I hope ya'll have a good day. TIA!!\n\nA: Unless there’s a compelling reasons to not take the easy route:\n\n*\n\n*ensure the iCloud backup is complete for all data\n\n*Restore the contacts after erasing all content and settings.\n\nFor 10,000 contacts, this takes about 10 minutes in my experience in the US. You might need more time to backup and restore the further away from Apple data centers you are, but contacts are very small amounts of data to back up and then restore.\nWhen you sign in again after erasing the device, just don’t sign in to iCloud when asked. Skip it from the setup assistant screen.\nSign in later from the settings app so you can control and turn off all the items except contacts.\n", "Q: How to mix fonts in a way that doesn't change line spacing? I'm trying to use Pages to write a technical document. The text has mix of normal font and a fixed width font (aka \"monospaced\") to represent computer code. For example:\n\nThe problem is that when there are multiple lines I can see that the fixed width font pushes the line height out and makes the text look bad. It does this even though both the fonts are the same point size. It even does it when I reduce the fixed width font size a little. Here is a larger screenshot to show what I mean.\n\nSome fonts are worse than others. Courier for example, moves the line, but barely. I don't like the looks of it though – its letters appear significantly shorter than the surrounding Helvetica. I like the Fira Code font, but it moves the line a lot. I had to shrink the Fira Code all the way to 7pt before it stopped disrupting the line spacing.\nShouldn't fonts with same point size have the same line height? If not, is there some way to choose fonts that do? Is there a certain kind of font, or property of the font, that I should be looking for?\n\nA: There are two problems here. The first is that the 'point size' metric refers the total height from the top of an ascender to the bottom of a descender (and a little bit of space beyond that): in traditional metal type, 12pt was the size of the lead block that the letter was 'carved' out of. So when you put each row of letters down, they line up in multiples of 12pt. So 6 lines of 12pt text uses 1 inch of the page.\n.\n\n.\nDifferent typefaces have different x-heights -- the height of letters like a o e, so that some appear to be much larger than others on the page. Also, digital typefaces have complicated things, making the measurement slightly more arbitrary.\nThe second problem is Page's typography. The default line Spacing is set to use '1 Line'. If you change that to use Exactly 14pt (or whatever), then the problem will go away.\n.\n\n\nA: Not the perfect solution, but one way is to select a font face and size for each type of text that makes the two look right together, then use those instead of the two you have been using.\nThe Font picker in some apps (TextEdit→Format→Fonts) will allow you to select \"Fixed Width\" and see which installed fonts meet that condition.\n", "Q: intermittent alert sound tritone playing running HighSierra and hearing intermittent tritone sounds. I noticed that the sound happened at the same time as the previous day.\nThere are no user applications/scripts open when this happens, even after rebooting.\nI would like to know if there is a way to find out where this alert sound is coming from and how to disable it.\nEDIT - the sound seems to happen at the same time every day.

Being said that, the work around I did is to back up my files into iCloud Drive and then factory reset my mac book pro.\n\nA: If you know that the problem is confined to one user account, then you should follow the standard troubleshooting tips for any user account problem.\nFirst,resetting anything outside of the user domain, like the OS itself, the SMC, NVRAM,  etc is not going to do anything.\nThere may be several preference keys across multiple plists at fault. You can try looking through the .GlobalPreferences.plist (normally invisible); any other plists with trackpad/input related filenames.\nBeyond that, you may have to do a 'binary search': take half the plists out; restart/log in; test the problem. If the problem remains, switch the halves and test again. If the problem has gone, restore half of the half.\n", "Q: Time Machine encryption variations - how does each work? I've seen some great answers on Time Machine encryption, especially one by Gordon Davisson. But the variations regarding networked volumes is still hazy. The rules for locally attached volumes seem clear - it's an all-or-nothing proposition, please verify:\nTM unencrypted backup to unencrypted volume: TM does an unencrypted backup.\nTM encrypted backup to unencrypted volume: TM encrypts the volume (and all the files on it) then does the backup.\nTM unencrypted backup to encrypted volume: TM decrypts the volume (and all the files on it) then does the backup.\nTM encrypted backup to encrypted volume: TM does a backup and the OS handles the encryption?\nNow, as for network attached storage:\nTM unencrypted backup to unencrypted volume: TM creates an unencrypted backupbundle.\nTM encrypted backup to unencrypted volume: TM creates an encrypted backupbundle. The other files on the volume are not encrypted and require no password?\nTM unencrypted backup to encrypted volume: TM creates an unencrypted backupbundle, but it is encrypted by the OS anyway because the volume is encrypted? The backupbundle requires the same password as all the other files on the volume??\nTM encrypted backup to encrypted volume: TM creates an encrypted backupbundle but what password does it require - the TM specified password or the volume's password (assuming they are different). Are two passwords required, one to mount the volume and one to open the backupbundle (Apple's documentation implies that you can)? Is the backupbundle encrypted separately using a different key than the other files or is it double-encrypted? Does reality exist?... oops too many questions.\nThank you for your patience! Any light on this subject would be appreciated.\n\nA: It’s pretty easy if you just look at the disks and you’re on a moderately new macOS version.\nToday, Apple encrypts disks and not backups. If the source is encrypted, it doesn’t matter because it gets copied unencrypted to the Destiination. If the destination is not encrypted the file stay clear, if the destination is encrypted, the files are encrypted.\nApple does encryption at rest, so until the filesystem is uncounted and then the key to decrypt them is no longer valid until a key to unlock is provided.\nYou can inspect encryption status with these two commands.\ndiskutil apfs list\ndiskutil cs list\n\nAPFS is the newer modern filesystem and core storage was used after the original method of encrypted sparse disk images. Complicated, so that’s why you see so many answers here on the old method, the newer method and the current method. Full disk encryption arrived with 10.7 Lion, so many major versions ago the old implementation is likely not in play for you.\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between FileVault 2 and Disk Utility Encryption?\n\n*When does encryption actually happen in MacOS/OS X encrypted volumes?\n", "Q: Finder not showing DVD/CD drive even when it is checked in the Preferences I am playing a DVD so it's definitely \"understood\" by macOS to be present.

I tried booting into EFI by holding ⌥ Option⌘ CommandFO\nMy end goal is to enable nested VT-x in VirtualBox.\n\nA: It's not mentioned which MacBook Pro is being used, but it's a safe bet that the CPU is capable of VT-x but it may be disabled.  I've checked a 2012 iMac, a 2017 MacBook Pro and a 2014 Mac mini and all had VT-x supported and enabled.\nCheck if supported:\nTo check if your Mac supports VT-X, issue the following command:\n% sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features\n\nYou should get output similar to below.  If you see VMX, your CPU is capable of VT-x.\nmachdep.cpu.features: FPU VME DE PSE TSC MSR PAE MCE CX8 APIC SEP MTRR PGE MCA \nCMOV PAT PSE36 CLFSH DS ACPI MMX FXSR SSE SSE2 SS HTT TM PBE SSE3 PCLMULQDQ \nDTES64 MON DSCPL VMX SMX EST TM2 SSSE3 CX16 TPR PDCM SSE4.1 SSE4.2 x2APIC POPCNT \nAES PCID XSAVE OSXSAVE TSCTMR AVX1.0 RDRAND F16C\n\nSupported but Disabled/Locked\nApple provides a support document, If VT-x virtualization technology is locked or disabled on your Mac to address this issue.  Basically, you need to ensure your software is updated to latest version.\nVT-x is enabled by default, but there's no \"setting\" or command that can be issued to turn it on.  Try resetting the NVRAM by holding  ⌘ Command⌥ OptionPR while booting.\nYou can issue the command nvram -xp to dump the NVRAM contents.  If you parse through it, you won't find any variable related to virtualization.\nPossible Solutions\nI've read (can't remember source) that installing either Parallels or VMware Fusion could enable locked virtualization features.  There's a community version of Fusion and a Trial of Parallels.  You could give either/both a shot - if it doesn't work, no harm no foul.\nIn the end, if it's not enabled, it would be best to file a bug report with Apple at https://www.apple.com/feedback/macbook.html because this feature should be enabled by default.\n\nA: According to Apple's list of startup key combinations, that is not a valid command, and there is no way of 'booting into EFI', beyond the normal EFIboot that starts the Mac in the usual way.\n", "Q: What does iCloud *not* backup for iOS?

Like Notes, Safari, Home, Health etc etc\n\nA: Apps are not backed up unless you specifically tell it to back them up. The idea is that all ios apps come from the app store and they have a record of all your apps so you can download them again.\n\nA: Passwords and health data are not saved to the cloud from what I understand.

I accidentially started to decrypt my FileVault so I am wondering what is the process?\nWill it reset my computer so I will have to put in my info?\nOr will It just start up again and ask for my password?\n\nA: FileVault decryption does not erase any data or reset your computer.\nWhen the decryption process is finished, the computer will be just like before - except that the data on disk is no longer encrypted. You can use the computer while it is decryption.\nAs this was done by accident, it is a good idea to enable FileVault again when it is done decrypting.

Late 2019, there were a series of reports that the then-latest Catalina update corrupted Mac firmware and caused computers to be bricked. My computer (MacBookPro11,1) appeared to be one of those affected. The reason why I believe this is real is because I always do a hardware diagnostic check before and after an upgrade. Before the update, the computer reported no problems. Afterwards, it reported memory problems. The hardware could've failed at that exact time, but it's quite a coincidence.\nMy Mac is now a door stop, but so many months later, I wonder whether there are any solutions found other than replacing the mainboard? There was also an account of someone reflashing the firmware with some tool, but there were never any details on this and I was not able to find this tool.\nAnyone have first-hand experience with this that can comment?\n\nA: I can't speak with any expertise, but I can speak from experience, as two of my machines fell victim to this.\nI don't know if I would call it a \"corruption\" issue, though it isn't too far from reality (Technically, the firmware isn't corrupt, it just doesn't boot the system. Since you were able to run diagnostics after the Mac was \"bricked\" I'm convinced that this was true in your case as well. Big difference, I know, the end result is the machine doesn't post, but it did make troubleshooting a lot harder for me.)\nSo as you said, the Catalina update involves changes to the firmware. Specifically, it updates it. Many macOS updates have included firmware upgrades as part of the process however, so why are there issues in the Catalina update?\nI don't know. I can only guess. I don't think there is a way to start multiple processors in EFI, and if a big application fails, more often than not the processor resets. And it's meant to start up again, make another attempt.\nBut sometimes it just fails to do this. In my case, perhaps it was because I had added drivers, applications etc. to my EFI, and the MultiUpdater(?) choked on the significantly altered region of the firmware that outlines descriptors of regions and their offsets.\nSince you're working on a portable, power failure seems less likely, but it's still possible, when you're making changes to the SMC, EFI, and depending on each individual circumstance, even a microcode update (sort of like firmware for the CPU, bad analogy but whatever :P)\nWhat usually ends up happening, from my experience, and from the anecdotes I've heard, is that for one reason or another, the BootROM flash doesn't happen, and usually the update application with a bunch of drivers is left on the ROM. For me, it went into a sort of half booted state, where the bootrom has started, doesn't flash the update and is just doing nothing, and also there is nothing you can do to change its startup behavior.\nFor T2 Macs, there is a supported solution, you can put them into DFU mode and restore the T2 firmware (which now envelops the smc).\nFor non T2/T1 Macs, the solution is simpler in one sense but infinitely more convoluted in another. Basically you open up the machine, and physically access the SPI bootrom SOIC8 nor memory chip to program it using known good firmware edited to include your serial number.\nThat's what I did to my non-T2 iMac, which I had modified to use without an internal display installed. Getting the materials/resources gathered up takes some effort and a lot of time, but the actual flash, is done in a flash :)\nDepending on where you live, there may be non-apple authorized repair shops providing this service for a lot less than what a replacement logic board costs.\nI don't think I can help with the firmware, I'm pretty sure my mbp is 10,something, but you can find SPI ROM dumps, all cleaned (like an SMC reset, but more like SMC wipe and reprogram from official Intel releases) and ready for a serial number if you google around. You might end up paying around 5 bucks for it.\n\nA: You can keep on hand a USB stick of your system-system your computer came with or last system with compatible firmware (until Apple adds a security update that actually bricks your USB port too)\nAll Apple security update are mainly 99% firmware add ons to brick 3rd party hardware and software developers, absolutely nothing to do with protecting you, the products you purchased or your privacy., in fact its Apple and some in congress you should be worried about.\nSo create a USB version of the system your computer shipped with or re download it in Recovery mode..issue with this is Apple messes with the installers as well, for example the installer for Majove now requires you to format the designated HD as AFPS!, imagine that, with out notice the system that was released before AFPS formats existed now requires this, and this is because Diskwarrior, etc can't save your data once Apple bricks your CPU or HD...\nYou can check the integrity of your EFI firmware using a terminal command;  usr/libexec/firmwarechecker/eficheck/eficheck --integrity-check  Terminal throws out no matching service found. either this system  is not supported by eficheck or you need to reload the kext.

When I am connected to the company VPN (via the built-in client, no third party VPNs), and my computer goes to sleep, it often freezes for a few minutes when waking up.\nWhen this happens, upon tapping a key or the track pad the screen wakes up, but the mouse cursor is frozen, and the keyboard does not seem to register any input. The touch bar still works (I can adjust volume, brightness, etc), and if I press Esc then the screen immediately turns off, as though it realized \"oh snap, I'm actually still asleep\". If I wait 3-5 minutes, it will eventually shake itself out of this stupor and wake up properly.\nIt also only seems to happen if it goes to sleep for at least a few minutes (so, only on actual sleep, not just display blanking).\nedit: remove previous edit\n\nA: I also have the 15” 2018 MacBook Pro running Catalina 10.15.5 and am running into the same issue.\nThis started a month or two ago but has gotten worse, today especially.\nThe keyboard and mousepad freeze after a certain amount of time after closing the lid; when I reopen it’s unresponsive. It used to work after I woke up the Touch Bar, however that’s no longer waking the keyboard and pad. I’ve just reset the SMC so will update if this manages to fix the issue.\n\nA: I have a 2019 16\" MBP that's been exhibiting this issue. Tried several other fixes (updates, etc), finally reset the SMC a couple of days ago, and that appears to have resolved the issue. Will update if it returns, but based on a couple of days use, SMC reset is the ticket.\nAlso for anyone bumping into this, it was something about the internal keyboard and trackpad.

Note: I have already read MRT Process using large unbounded amount of memory (but here the context is different: \"I'd rather not remove it\") and a few similar questions/articles like MRT is peaking my cpu, but a good complete solution was not easily findable.\nOn my Macbook Pro with High Sierra, the CPU fan was making a loud noise, and after doing top in Terminal, I noticed that a process called MRT was using ~100% CPU.\nSo how do I remove MRT (Malware Removal Tool)?\n\nA: Removing Apple's Malware Removal Tool is not a good idea, so it's better to figure out why it's running high.\nAlso, 100% is a per-core figure, so on quad-core i7, you can use up to 800% CPU. Various OS processes, like Spotlight, will use similar levels of CPU for short periods.\nMRT may use significant CPU for a short time while it does its job: downloading malware lists from Apple, and then checking/removing anything on that list.\nIf you have got a 'runaway' MRT process, then that might indicate that it is trying (but not succeeding) to remove some malware. You could try using MalwareBytes to check and remove anything on your disk, as suggested on the other thread.\nAt worst,  I would just recommend restarting, rather than disabling SIP and killing MRT, both of which severely reduce the security of your Mac -- particularly if malware is already on board.\n\nA: (As I struggled to solve the problem, I share it with the Q&A feature).\nThis is not recommended, but if you know what you are doing, and really want to remove MRT, here is how:\n\n*\n\n*First reboot in Recovery mode (CMD+R pressed while reboot), open a Terminal, then do: csrutil disable\n\n\n*Then reboot in normal mode, open a terminal and do:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.mrt\nsudo launchctl remove com.apple.mrt\nchmod -R -x+X /System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app\nsudo pkill MRT\n\n", "Q: Delete user account - High Sierra - 10.13.2 I have, since I bought my device second hand, an account that was created by the seller.

I'd really like to know where this is coming from. Sometimes it looks like the computer makes the sound when the Ethernet cable and/or the power cable are disconnected, but I haven't been able to reliably link the sound to any of these events as the sound is not played every time they happen.

We're in Catalina now an cron is still around and fully functional.\nIt's also important to note that there is a difference between deprecated and no longer supported.\n\n*\n\n*cron is deprecated meaning that while still supported, there's no more development on it and admins/users should start migrating to the new tool(s) (launchd).\n\n*AFP is no longer supported for file sharing.  You can use it as a client (connect to an old server with AFP support), but you cannot share a folder from Mojave/Catalina with AFP.\n\nJust because Apple makes a move to support a more modern technology, doesn't mean they are going resect it from their base code so it's not longer available in future versions.\n", "Q: Terminal \"history\" command brings back different results In OSX's terminal, I run the history command to find my recent commands.

For example, I will log on one-day and notice my commands from the previous day are not showing in history (though they did they day before) but rather last week's commands are there.\nHow do you troubleshoot this? Is it an error or I am understanding something incorrectly?\n\nA: In other words, Terminal.app connects you to a certain shell, allowing you to access all sorts of them concurrently.\nRun cat /etc/shells to see what shells are on your system.\nI’m sure you’ve got Bash, ZSH, and a few others.\nThen read up on configuring the history for your chosen shell, and try to make it a habit to always know which shell you’re using.\nThe fish shell, for instance, has an extensive and user friendly history browser, allowing you to see all commands you’ve run using fish.\nWith bash it’s a bit different.\nAlso Mac specific:\nIf you have apps that run maintenance and require administrative privileges, they likely run some of their tasks as simple shell scripts, and almost always using sh.\nThink: Catalina Cache Cleaner, Cocktail and Onyx, to name a few.\n", "Q: How do I make an HDD as fast as an SSD? I have a really slow iMac that I bought 2 years ago. I've been so annoyed about how I have to wait for the rainbow circle to stop loading. I did some research and found out it's about the hard drive. My iMac had an HDD drive. I didn't want to buy an SSD so I thought why not do something to make the HDD as fast as an SSD.\nCan you please help me on making an HDD as fast as an SSD?\n\nHere are my imac specs\n\n\nA: If you want to make a hard drive run as fast as an SSD, install lots of RAM, and put the system to sleep rather than shutting it down when you're finished.  If you've got enough RAM (in my experience, 64 GB is enough for a typical desktop), after a day or two of use, the parts of the disk that you normally use will be cached in memory, so the disk won't actually be accessed.\nNote that it's considerably cheaper to get an SSD than it is to install enough RAM for this to work.\n\nA: I'm afraid that's impossible. Your hard drive is essentially not much different from an old record turntable: it has spinning disks and a 'head' that writes or reads the magnetic stripe at a point on the wheel.\nThere are many different mechanical parts that all contribute limitations to the maximum possible speed.\nFurthermore: it's a sealed unit, made in a factory. If there was some easy 'tweak' to make it as fast as an SSD, the manufacturers would have done it.\n\nA: *\n\n*SSD are designed like a car. HDD are trucks.\n\n*You can’t make a truck operate like a car unless you buy a car and call it a truck.\n\n*Diesel fuels most trucks and some cars (computer “fuel” is SATA interface and command set).\n\n*Most cars run gas (NVMe).\n\nYou want a light car running on gas to get the best acceleration. Boot to the fastest SSD connected via NVMe controller for max performance and speed, there is no shortcut, especially with a truck response and SATA driving.\nSome HDD add a layer of SSD and try to cache data similar to how Apple does Fusion drives (think nitrous oxide), but this doesn’t get you NVMe.\nIn the end, connect an SSD via thunderbolt if you need equivalent speeds to having an internal SSD on an iMac. Your iMac is capable of tens of thousands of io per second if you bring fast storage to it, internally or externally so your wish can be granted, just not with HDD.\nShop for NVMe over Thunderbolt is my advice.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macworld.com/article/3276325/nvme-over-thunderbolt-killer-external-storage-with-caveats.html\n", "Q: Edited Sudoers file and Relocated Items I had to edit my sudoers file on Sierra or High Sierra (I don't remember which one.)

I saw someone's suggestion about using image capture application, but I can't find that either.\nThank you\n\nA: You can use Image Capture to save you photos to a folder somewhere.

My Macbook Pro's Apple Diagnostics currently reports PPM002, PPM003 and PPM004 error codes, which are associated with the on-board memory.\nApple's page on this topic is not illuminating.\nIs there a technician's or engineering manual somewhere that documents these?\n\nA: Apple in the past did not share technical documents like that outside being a certified repair tech. This changed in April of 2022 for iPhone and will cover some Mac hardware models in alignment with Apple’s “repair manifesto” paper shortly starting with recent MacBooks Pro and Air.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/08/apple-expands-self-service-repair-to-mac-notebooks/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apples-self-service-repair-now-available/\nIn the end, if the RAM is soldered to the board, it means call for a repair but I understand wanting to see high quality repair manuals, they are awesome for learning how things work and how they break.\nI don’t know of any place that broke NDA and shared the manuals covering this - so you probably would get an answer indirectly by engaging  Apple support.

Then I tried to find a note by searching for keywords. Search does not return any result for me.\nI tried to find a fix for hours today, without success.\nPossible solutions\nLink 1: Two suggestions\nHere is a discussion that adresses the problem: Notes app search is not finding some notes\nIn that thread there are some suggestions\n\n*\n\n*turning off notes in iCloud, restarting and turning it on again. (Did that, without success.)\n\n*re-indexing with spotlight (via command line or via System prefs). (Did that, no success.)\n\nLink 2: Points to Spotlight issues\nThis discussion says it might have to do with excluding ~/Library/Containers from spotlight search. But I haven't excluded that folder.\nMy system\n\n*\n\n*Am using MacOS Catalina, Version 10.15.5.\n\n*In Notes.app I turned off local notes. I keep all my notes in iCloud.\n\n*I can see all my notes on my iPhone and iPad. Search works there without a problem.\n\nEdit\nSearch within one single note works, but\nSearch across notes fails\nHere is a screenshot of what I see. I have only 16 notes. My search term delivers me four notes on my iPhone, but nothing on Notes.app on my Mac.\n\nEdit 2: Decided to ditch Notes.app\nAfter so many hours in trying to fix the broken search in my Notes.app, I decided to get rid of it altogether. Why? Because\n\n*\n\n*it is opaque (proprietary database, no way to look into what's wrong)\n\n*no easy import / export (my data is siloed in this app, I can't get it out)\n\n*it is developed and supported by Apple! that means, support is minimal. Every other app developer would have solved an issue within hours (Ulysses.app, Bear.app, TaskPaper app, these kind of apps have super responsive teams, because they are small companies, but not Apple; it will answer my requests as if they are talking to retards (\"have you restarted/rebooted your MacBook Pro?\" kind of answers))\n\nSo this incident was an eye opener for me. Better get rid of the app with a handful notes, instead of using it for years, accumulating some 10k notes and then having a serious problem with the app, just when I need it.\n\nA: I solved this for me. I am on macOS Monterey 12.4 (Notes.app v4.9). My Notes.app uses both accounts of (A) iCloud and (B) 'On My Mac'. The iCloud account I use for my working notes and 'On My Mac' account for archiving notes I don't need in iCloud anymore. The Notes.app search function stopped working a week or 2 ago. It wouldn't find anything in either account. Another iCloud-linked Mac of similar specs does not have any problem with the search function for the iCloud account (but, obviously, won't have access to the same aforementioned 'On My Mac' account, anyway).\nAfter reading the many and various suggestions here and elsewhere without any sure fix, I was inspired to try something I had not read anyone else suggest: -\nSolution: -\nI tried simply option-dragging my most important folder that needs searching to the 'On My Mac' account area. This creates a copy in that account instead of moving it. Thereafter, the search function started working again. I deleted the copy, and the search function continued to work. The search function now works for other folders, too, but I didn't test them all.\nMaybe this will work for other readers, too.\nETA 2022-08-07.\nThe above 'fix' did not last long - maybe only a week or so before needing to be redone for another short temporary fix ad nauseam. This is extremely tedious. Is switching to another app (Evernote etc) the only permanent fix? I have about 8000 notes archived in the 'On My Mac' area and 900 notes in the iCloud area. Judging from comments from others with far fewer notes, the issue doesn't seem to be quantity related.\nETA 2022-10-07.\nNow I am on macOS 12.6 and this is still an on-going tedious issue. I have found the least bothersome process which temporarily fixes the issue (for all notes?) for a few days is to run Disk Utilities First Aid on the Data volume in the boot drive. Booting from Recovery Disk Mode to do this is NOT required. It works after booting the Mac normally. I haven't experimented with leaving any apps open (including Notes) when running the First Aid: I quit out of everything (excepting Finder, of course) and run it.\nI am now wondering if some other macOS-level app is causing the problem. I have Micromat's TechTool Pro and LifeSpan apps installed which presumably run some low-level routiens.\n\nA: For a search to work you have to tell the search function where to search. So if you put the notes on the icloud drive you want to click on that and then search. The search function works fine on Notes as it searches inside each note.\n\nA: I've had Monterey for roughly a year and have used search feature constantly. In the past 2 months this happened 3 times. This last time it happened disabled iCloud Notes and then enabled it again, then rebooted.  The reboot might be the only important step, I'll try that next time.\nPrevious 2 times it happend, I was doing all kinds of things like spotlight re-index, disabling/enabling icloud notes etc from the various support forums online. I gave up both times, which is why I think the reboot might be important step after the enable/disable. First 2 times it happened, it just started working again next day, so likely after a reboot? (I shutdown end of each day)\nThis last time I did numerous searches and before it started happening. I have some notes that are on iCloud and then some that are only on my mac. The search will not give any results for either when this occurs.\nWill update next time this happens, will try reboot immediately to see if that works without anything else.\n", "Q: App to sort through every file on Mac? I'm switching to a new computer and want to sort though my files to back up some of them. Basically, I'm looking for a Mac feature or app that I can use to sort through every user-generated file. I want all of my files in a list with an option to save or delete each one, without having to sort through folders and hidden files and non user-generated files.\nDoes this exist?\nThanks\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you would like to back up every file that was created by you. If that is the case, all your files should be in /Users/Username. You can simply go to Disk Utility, hit Shift + Command + N and select the /Users directory if you would like to backup multiple users or just select the /Users/Username directory for one user and then make a Disk Image. Be aware that this will also back up the app data for the users selected.\n\nA: \na Mac feature or app that I can use to sort through every user-generated file. I want all of my files in a list with an option to save or delete each one, without having to sort through folders and hidden files and non user-generated files.\n\nA utility like Disk Inventory X might be useful just to see the expanse of your hard drive.\nOr, if you wanted an explicit list thereof (but again, without this save/delete convenience), you could look into some variation of this Terminal command:\nfind -E -s . -name \".?*\" -prune -o -iregex '.*\\.(app|dmg|pkg)' -print -prune -o -print | LC_ALL=C sort -f\n\nThat is, it lists all files on your volume (ignoring those prefixed by . and ignoring all files contained in application package contents), sorting within each directory, case-insensitive.\n", "Q: How to find activity log with time stamps of when applications were opened and closed on MacBook Pro Is it possible to see a log of when any given application was opened, running, and then closed on my MacBook Pro?

Any guidance would be helpful. Thanks!\nMax\n\nA: The console app is in your utilities folder which is in your Applications folder. This app is for browsing thru log files. To find when an application was started open the console app and click on Mac Analytics Data on the left side of the console app. Then you can search for the name of the app you are looking for.

I shut it down to stop the loop, but the loop just restarts.  Booting to safe mode breaks the loop... by taking me to a blank white screen until I shutdown.  Booting to recovery mode simply traps me on the loading screen, but there is no loading bar or apple logo, just an eternal circle with a line through it.

After the text stopped, the screen turned solid gray and the text disappeared, and a few minutes later it rebooted again back into the loop.\nhttps://streamable.com/e/m4xuku\nI used option D to run a test, it found nothing wrong.\n\nA: The graphical anomalies that you're seeing on boot are usually indicative of a GPU failure or logic board failure; for a MacBook Pro the difference between the two is immaterial in terms of what would need to be replaced since the GPU is soldered to the logic board. Booting into safe mode disables the GPU which likely explains your ability to get somewhere without having the machine kernel panic and power off.\nThe video you posted shows the machine running fsck_hfs, which checks the filesystem for errors, and it lists some issues with the filesystem. There's a possibility that you're dealing with GPU/board failure compounded with filesystem corruption caused by/during the failure of the hardware.\nThe diagnostics that would be available at an Apple Store (or over the phone as long as your machine is new enough) would be able to determine with a high degree of certainty whether or not you have a hardware issue.\n", "Q: Port Forwarding an SSH Connection on macOS I have been trying to use SSH over the internet to connect to a few different computer on my network. Unfortunately, it only seems to work on the computer that is set to the forwarded port of 22 (ssh port).

I can access my router non-locally and change the computer I am trying to access to forward to port 22, but I would really like a better solution.\nI am not very familiar with bash commands (I think these are bash?) and am at a loss. Fortunately I have been able to connect to my storage server via SAMBA, but I would really like to be able to ssh into each computer independently.\n\nA: If I understand the setup properly, you're using the wrong option to control what port it makes the connection over. If the router is forwarding port 70 to port 22 of the internal ssh server you want to connect to, then from the outside you'd connect with something like:\nssh -p 70 username@router_external_ip\n\nNote that I'm using -p 70 to control what port it connects to on the \"server\" (which is actually the router, but since the connection comes in on port 70 it should be forwarded to port 22 on the internal server).\nThis is very different from what the -L option does. What -L does is tell ssh to make a (tunneled) port forward of its own after connecting to the SSH server. Adding -L 22:someip:70 tells the ssh program to listen on port 22 of your local computer (by default, it also listens only in the local loopback interface), and if it receives any connections on that port it should forward them over the SSH connection to the remote computer, with instructions that the remote computer should forward them on to port 70 on someip.\nYou could use sort of port forward, for example, to tunnel filesharing connections to your storage server so you wouldn't have to have to expose the storage server directly on the open Internet (which is probably not very safe). There's an example of using it to tunnel VNC (screen sharing) in this stackoverflow question.\n\nA: Create multiple forwarding rules in the router, one for each machine behind it that you want to SSH into. Use different high ports as the input for each.\n", "Q: Apple Watch can't send/receive SMS while using cellular plan I've been using Apple Watch Series 3 for a while.  I just upgraded to a Series 5 and while I love it for the most part, I have noticed that if the watch is on cellular and my phone is not nearby the watch will not send or receive SMS messages.  I can make/receive phone calls just fine and if I'm on WiFi it sends and receives SMS without issue.  It is only when I'm on the cellular plan.\nI can always send/receive iMessages.\nI have unpaired and repaired the watch, I've talked to Apple and I've talked to AT&T.  I know I remember sending and receiving SMS on the Series 3 LTE+GPS while away from my phone.  Both Apple and AT&T seem to understand that the watch should be able to send/receive SMS while on cellular so long as the iPhone is on and connected to the Internet (via WiFi or cellular itself) but that the phone should not have to be nearby.  Neither seems to know how to fix this issue.\nI would really appreciate any assistance that anyone may have.  I find it difficult to believe that my Series 3 was capable of something that they left out of the Series 5.\nI found this article on Apple's site which also confirmed the watch should be able to do it as long as it has a data connection and the phone is on and has a data connection.\nAgain, any help would be greatly appreciated.\nWhen I send a message from an outside source to the phone/watch it shows up on the phone and in iMessage on the Macbook Pro / iPad Pro but does not show up on the watch.\nEDIT #3:  More talking to AT&T who still cannot solve the issue, but it is now back to an inability to send or receive when using the cellular plan.\n\nA: This isn't really a solution as much as an answer.  My girlfriend has a Series 4 LTE+GPS model on Verizon and a friend of mine has a Series 3 LTE+GPS model on Sprint.  I saw them over the last few days and they were kind enough to let me test things.\nBoth Apple Watches behaved in the same way.  Sending / receiving SMS while using a cellular connection was difficult and out of 10 tests per device, including mine, we only got them to send an SMS and receive a reply 4 times out of 30 tests.  Since 3 carriers and 3 different models had these same issues, I am personally concluding that it is some kind of software issue.  Since the devices are primarily designed to work with a cell phone within range, I expect that there is some as-yet-unknown issue in this specific though possibly rare use case.\nWe cannot packet sniff or do other advanced diagnostics on how the watch communicates with the cellular network to accomplish its tasks.  This fact combined with the fact that most tech support agents you can speak with on the phone at a carrier are simply running off of checklists without being knowledgeable in how their network actually works leads me to believe that this problem will have to wait for a carrier solution.\nI believe the issue is with how it appears the watch sends and receives SMS while away from the phone.  The iPhone is required to be turned on and connected (I quote the article linked in my question):\n\nMake sure that your Apple Watch can connect to your iPhone, cellular, or Wi-Fi. To send and receive SMS/MMS from cellular models of Apple Watch, your paired iPhone must be powered on and connected to Wi-Fi or cellular, but your iPhone doesn’t need to be nearby.\nEven if your iPhone isn’t connected or powered on, you can send and receive iMessages on your Apple Watch when your Apple Watch is connected to Wi-Fi or cellular.\n\nThis indicates to me that the watch uses UMTS for phone calls but not for SMS.  Since phone calls with the watch under cellular can be completed without the assistance of the paired phone.  I tested this just to be sure and powered off my phone but could still make and receive calls on the watch perfectly.  It appears the watch intends to send it's SMS messages to its paired phone over iMessage to then be relayed through the phone's cellular connection.  Similarly the phone appears to receive an SMS first and then relay to the watch similarly.  I did delay testing using the watch connected to WiFi only and the phone only connected to cellular.  The phone would receive the SMS first and between 0.5 and 2 seconds later the watch and other iMessage devices would receive the message as well.  Likewise testing sending under the same conditions the watch would send a message, it would then hit the other iMessage devices in roughly about a second, then 3-4 seconds after showing up on iMessage devices connected to my iCloud account it would show up at the receiver.\nIf I turn off the phone sending and receiving SMS fails to work (as the Apple documents indicate) on any iMessage device (this includes my iPad which has its own cellular connection and my two MacBooks).\nGiven all of this, I am convinced that there is a relay problem due to network provisioning and connectivity issues for the SMS relay to take place while the watch is using cellular data.\nThis is backed up by an experience I had previously in testing the ability for a cellular device to run an internet service.  I had attempted to run a small web server on an Android device on my AT&T account and was unable to open a port on the Internet side of the connection.  The test was part of a University project and not part of this testing.  Technical support from AT&T indicated that they specifically make it difficult for devices on their cellular network to be directly accessed on the Internet unless the device has been specially provisioned.  It was also indicated that this was done in the name of security but in the same call such provisioning was possible under specific request for a business account holder and would cost extra to implement.\nGiven these factors I'm considering the issue closed.  I believe the watch uses iCloud to relay information to/from the phone for SMS (and possibly other) functionality and that cellular services make it extremely difficult to establish this kind of connection reliably for standard cellular clients.\n", "Q: Do we have to submit a Paid Application Agreement if I intend to fix a price for my app @ 0.99$ Do we have to submit a Paid Application Agreement if I intend to fix a price for my app @ 0.99$\n\n*\n\n*Is the agreement for a longer period or can be renewed after a certain interval\n\n*Can we update the pricing once the app is inside the App Store\n\n\nA: Yes, you have to submit the agreement no matter what the price is - as long as it is not free.\nThe agreement runs for a longer period, but Apple will periodically make updates and changes, and at that point you'll have to agree to it again.\nYou can update the pricing at any time both before it is listed on the App Store, and while it is listed on the App Store.\n", "Q: Safari on MacBookPro opens mobile YouTube After WWDC2020 I can't open common YouTube in Safari on my MacBookPro 2020.

Moreover, if I bear with it and don't do anything, they keep spinning like crazy for hours and never seem to calm down.\nThe weird part is : If I close the lid of my computer (which is plugged to another screen, so it doesn't shut down or anything), the fans calm down slowly. If I open the lid again while they're calming or when they're done, the problem doesn't come back immediately (but will eventually, a few hours later).\nI've read about people having fans spinning WHEN closing the lid, but I don't know what to do about this problem in particular.\nAny idea ? :D\n\nA: You may as well ignore the fan thing unless it really bugs you. What I would do is download Macs Fan Control. Once the app is running, keep it running in the background. When the Mac fan starts up again, open the app and set the fan to a certain speed, and then reset it to automatic.\n\nA: You mention you have an external screen connected. In my experience, mixing retina and non-retina displays can cause the graphics card to work extra hard (hence why I work with my laptop screen closed).\nMy guess is is not the CPU that is getting hot, but the GPU. Not sure if there is an app that can display the GPU temperature to prove this theory.\n", "Q: How to Delete a MacOS Notification Center Widget? How to Delete a MacOS Notification Center Widget? Not how to disable it or simply turn it off, but how to completely remove it, like uninstalling it or simply finding the executable and deleting it?\n\nA: It is probably unsafe to delete executables without knowing if the main app executable depends on them.\nWidgets are .wdgt files. To completely remove the widgets you must delete them from your machine or move them to a different folder. There are 2 Library folders on your computer. Each Library folder has a Widgets folder. You may remove the widget from the widgets folder to get rid of it. One Library folder is in your home directory. /Users/username/Library, and the top level folder is /Library. You cannot edit the latter on macOS Catalina.\nIt may also be possible that apps bundle the widget in the .app bundle. So right click on the myapp.app file & \"show package contents\". Some folders in, Resources folder may contain a wdgt file.\nYou can also use app like EasyFind to search the whole Mac for the extension.\nIf you need the app, but not its widget:\nOpen the notification panel and click on Today at the top of the pane. After that look to the bottom of the Today view and you should see an Edit button. Click this button. Now the active widgets will appear on the left. There will be a red circle at the top of each widget. Click this to remove the widget. See the images below.\n\nAfter clicking Edit we see:\n\n", "Q: iPhone XR's screen triggers other devices Recently I bought a brand new iPhone XR. When its screen is activated by some application (not necessarily a GSM call or a Wi-Fi thing), it affects other speakers or headphones around it. All of them sounds exact same 4 \"buff\" like sounds consecutively.  It reminds me of the way old mobile phones affected the speakers around them. Is there anyone knows why it happens and how to prevent it? It annoys me and I really need a solution.\n\nA: Typically, this kind of speaker interference happens when there is a large amount of cellular data transfer. If you keep your phone on WiFi and enable WiFi calling, you may experience it less since WiFi is a lower strength signal than cellular?\nI don't know if there is another way to avoid this...\n\nA: This is perhaps because your speakers and headphones are unshielded.\nQuote from this website:\n\nShielding a speaker (actually the driver(s) are shielded) typically\ninvolves using a second magnet, known as a bucking magnet, on the back\nof the driver magnet. This keeps the magnetic field from creating a\nlarge stray field that can affect closely placed electronic equipment.\nHow well it does this varies from speaker to speaker. There is still a\nstray field, however, it is typically small enough to allow CRT\nmonitors or TVs to be placed reasonably close. With the air space\ninside the cabinet providing a buffer zone a CRT can often be placed\nimmediately next to the speaker without adverse effect. This applies\nwhether the speaker is powered or unpowered.\n\nSo, you have two options: Use Airplane mode and use only Wi-fi in your house, or buy shielded speakers/headphones. It's not an Apple's problem; it's inherent in all GSM phones.\n", "Q: Mac mini mid 2010 stuck on Apple logo with full progress bar I bought a used Mac Mini mid-2010 server. When it arrived I turned it on and it booted regularly into macOS High Sierra, since this is the last version supported by this model. I verified that everything was working and then turned off the machine.\nThe problem is that now it won't boot. The Apple logo appears and the progress bar underneath goes all the way to the end, but it does not go beyond that point. Is is worth mentioning that the bar progresses relatively fast until it reaches the middle and then it goes really slowly until the end. I tried to boot into the Recovery partition and the same thing happens. I tried Internet Recovery, both using Option+Command+R and Shift+Option+Command+R (however, this last option yields a slightly different outcome: it gets stuck in the screen with the apple logo, but instead of the full bar, I get the spinning wheel). I also tried safe boot, resetting NVRAM and PRAM, and an installation USB thumb drive. The result is the same. Just display, keyboard and mouse connected to the Mac.\nFunny thing is I had an old SSD where a Windows distro was installed and if I plug it to the mac via USB adapter and select its EFI file by holding the Option key during boot, it goes right into a fully functional Windows environment, making me think that there is no hardware problem with it...\nEDIT:\nI booted using verbose mode and the boot seems to hang at this point:\nbusy timeout[0], (60s): ´IOFireWireLocalNode´\nEXC_RESOURCE -> sftwareupdated[210] exceeded mem limit: ActiveSoft 500 MB (non-fatal)\nhfs: mounted Recovery HD on device disk1s3\nhfs: unmount initiated on Recovery HD on device disk1s3\nbusy timeout[1], (60s): ´IOFireWireLocalNode´\nbusy timeout[2], (60s): ´IOFireWireLocalNode´\nbusy timeout[3], (60s): ´IOFireWireLocalNode´\nIOConsoleUsers: time(0) 0->0, lin 0, llk 1,\nIOConsoleUsers: gIOScreenLockState 3, hs 0, bs 0, now 0, sm 0x0\n\nSo, by my understanding there are two main issues here, possibly. The FireWire timeout and the exceeded memory limit related to software updates. No more text appears after these lines.\nIf it helps, I can also successfully boot into Single User mode, where I have access to a sh terminal.\n\nA: So, I finally found a solution. The verbose boot lead me to believe that the problem had something to do with the FireWire port/driver. Since I do not really need FireWire, I figured I could disable it. Therefore, based on a combination of other answers to similar questions, I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*First, I must disable SIP, so I can use the Single User mode with writing privileges. Since I cannot boot into Recovery mode, I used Single User Recovery mode, by holding Command+R+S (as suggested in https://superuser.com/a/1245838). From here, I just ran csrutil disable command to disable the SIP. Reboot.\n\n\n*Now, I need to deny the kernel access to the IOFireWireFamily kext, in order to disable the FireWire support. Allegedly, this could be achieved using several methods, such as chmod 000 the kext, moving it, unloading it or deleting it. I went with the last option. For this, I followed these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Enter in Single User mode (Command+S)\n\n*Give writing privileges to the user by running mount -rw / (https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/285013-how-to-use-single-user-mode-and-how-to-use-it-to-uninstall-kexts/)\n\n*Deleting the kext file using rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IOFireWireFamily.kext (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1805732)\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n\nNow, the system does not look for the faulty FireWire port/driver anymore and it boots into High Sierra without problems.\n\nA: I would certainly test booting to a working external Mac volume. It's odd that an installation thumb drive wouldn't boot at all, but Windows would.\nIf the Mini boots to the startup selection bit, and lets you boot to an external (Windows) drive, but won't boot to the internal one, then it seems likely that the internal drive has died. That's not unlikely for a 10-year-old server hard drive.\nYour best option is buy an SSD replacement, and fit it internally. External drives might be easier, but the Mini doesn't have the connections to run them at high speeds.\n\nA: I solved this problem and removed the xio2211ZAP chip on the back of the motherboard. Now my Mac mini can run macos in hhd and install the system with remove strong dmg  normally!

I will be switching to an iPhone soon. At the moment, my best photos reside in a nice folder structure in iCloud Photos. When getting the iPhone, i still want to be able to view those images but not clutter my iCloud Photos library with every single trivial image I take on the phone camera.\nIs it possible to keep the iPhone's Photos app connected to my iCloud photo storage and not have every image I make with the iPhone's camera end up in iCloud as well?\n\nA: No, iCloud Photo is an all-or-nothing type of thing.  You can't selectively decide what photos are synced to your devices are what are not.\nThe only way that I know you can keep trivial photos off iCloud is to disconnect iCloud Photos from that iPhone.  You'd still be able to keep the existing photos in iCloud but you'd have to manually add any new photos from that device.  You said in the comments that's not what you want to do but I'm adding that info here in case the comments get deleted.\n", "Q: Ditto command and wildcard on Catalina?

I usually wear rubber slippers or not touching a wall or floor.\nMaybe something wrong with your electricity grounding. Try to charge another laptop in your place, or try to charge your Macbook Pro in other places.\nIf the problem exists wherever you try to charge your Macbook Pro, you can ask the place where you bought your Macbook.\n\nA: You must try to determine if the charge that's causing the shock is a charge on the Macbook - or a charge on you! Static electricity can accumulate under a number of conditions. The shock you feel is due to the static discharge when current flows to equalize the potential difference.\nIf the static charge has accumulated on you, try this: \"Discharge\" yourself before touching the Macbook. You can generally do this by placing one or both of your hands on a wall, or the floor for 5-10 seconds before touching your Macbook.\nAlternatively, if you are sitting still in a chair, touch your Macbook, and are shocked - wait 5-10 seconds, and touch your Macbook again. If your Macbook repeatedly shocks you while sitting motionless, then your Macbook is accumulating the charge. At this point, you should take it to an authorized Apple repair facility to have it checked.\nIf the charge is on you... maybe look into some removal and prevention measures\n\n\nA: Yes, as bizarre as it sounds, the \"mild electric shock\" you describe is considered normal, and harmless, according to Apple. (I can't seem to find the article they posted, it may not be there anymore but you can read the safety information for the details.)\nIn some cases (usually with varying environment factors, e.g. for people with especially sweaty hands, unusual levels of voltage on their outlet ground, in dry weather; but also possibly when there is a defect in the power adapter) they get a full electric shock, like one would get when getting on a metal elevator after pulling a sweater over their heads and rubbing their back against a polyurethane painted wall — the ones you can see the \"zap\" even though the lights are on.\nIt's actually not isolated to Apple products, any appliance that has a metallic chassis tied to ground can do this if is powered by means of a switching power adapter plugged into an AC outlet with no ground. It's the difference between the \"0VDC\" that the adapter \"defines\" and the \"ground\" voltage that your body can serve as a path to.\nI don't know how to explain easily how your body is \"grounded\", since you could be standing in rubber soled shoes on hardwood floor, but for empirical demonstrations, try out caressing your laptop (that's what I did absentmindedly to get the \"buzzing\" feeling on my palm) while sitting on a bed with a wooden frame/bedposts, while standing on tile, while standing on carpet, and most significantly, while you're actually electrically grounded at some point.\nThe easiest way to do this in an up-to-date electrical-code compliant building is to touch a outlet, or switch cover screw with one of your fingers.\nIf you consider this a problem that you would like a solution to, you can get a three-pronged (grounded) extension cord for your power adapter/charger, that Apple used to include with all portable Macs, but now you gotta shell out $19 for. IMO they should have come up with a three-prong plug before making the move to stop including the cord in machines with 4-digit price tags, but it is what it is. :(\nI wouldn't recommend getting one from amazon or eBay, unless you can get the OEM cable Apple sells used for a lot cheaper or something (it's $20 bucks to ground your system worth hundreds of times more) I'd grumble and complain but pay up in the end, unfair as it is.\n\nEDIT: To answer the question, it depends on what the source of the \"shock\" is, and how bad it is. If it is so severe it could be described as painful (as in, after a few dozen shocks you feel the urge to hurl the laptop away from you) then this is not expected. Whether it should be serviced is a harder one to guess at without the adapter in hand, but the test would be:\n\n*\n\n*Plugging the charger in to a different outlet, preferably in a different building/from a different breaker panel and seeing if the same issues are present.\n\n\n*Getting a grounded power cable, whether it is from an acquaintance with an older portable Mac, an Apple Retail store (they will gladly lend you one, and you can also test different power outlets there) or buying one. However, if the shock was as serious as I described above and the problem goes away using a three-pronged extension cord, there is likely a problem with the wiring in your house or a connected major appliance that you really should isolate and fix.\n", "Q: I can’t hear anyone and they can’t hear me iPhone 6 My phone won’t let me enable speaker and no one can hear me and I can’t hear anyone else anyone know why?

So that there is no trace of the deleted files and nobody can access them anymore.\nThat's why I think the best option is to look for a software that formats the disk doing a lot of reading and writing.\nI can't find good and reliable software that does that on a Mac. Is there one?\n\nA: Writing multiple zeros on an SSD does nothing to improve the secure elimination of the data, and significantly reduces the life of the drive.\nIf you want to make sure that your files are safe: encrypt the drive.\n", "Q: Why does the Note I shared via AirDrop to my Mac from my iPhone not show up in Notes.app?

Console output shows nothing relevant (AFAIK).\nAlso, after this issue appeared, macOS asks me to allow incoming network connections for emlog.pl.\nAny idea how to debug this issue? I've already tried to reset NVRAM, PRAM and SMC.\n\nA: It seems like you have filevault enabled. You also have verbose mode enabled.\nBecause of this macOS needs to finish booting into the decrypted drive and it shows verbose output.  To avoid this disable filevault or verbose mode. That should fix the problem.\nTo disable filevault go to system preferences->security->FileVault and disable it there. If you want to disable verbose mode then I think you need to change back boot-args by running sudo nvram -d boot-args.\n\nA: I've never found this issue's root cause, but it was solved by wiping the disk and re-installing macOS.\nThis is probably a filevault-related issue but I needed to rule out the possibility of an hardware issue as my MacBook warranty was expiring. So I had to do it the hard way.\n\nA: It looks like its going into Verbose Boot Mode.\nThe emlog.pl is a Perl script which invokes a logging tool.\nWhy this happened I can't tell you.\n", "Q: Catalina: Can't sign out of iCloud and Update Apple ID settings error, WindowServer high cpu.

I'd like to recover the pictures from it preferably without having to pay to have a screen replaced on what is essentially an unsupported paperweight at this point.\nI've got a USB to 30pin adapter so I can connect a keyboard which has let me unlock the iPad. The problem now is that although it is unlocked I have to allow access/trust any computer I connect it to, which I can't do because I have to unplug the keyboard to plug in the USB cable.\nMy first idea was to pair it with a bluetooth keyboard. Unfortunatley iOS 9.3.5 seems to be horrificly bad at handling keyboards. Using Meta+Space I can get into settings but once in there I'm stuck. I can search within settings but can't get out of the search box and interact with the app iteself.\nThis issue is compounded by it not having any internet access.  Again if I could navigate settings I could connect it to wifi but that wont work. Of course because its not connected to wifi siri wont work.\nI'm running out of ideas at this point.

I am using a 2020 MacBook Pro and Word 2016.  I am having issues opening a document sent by a friend.  He is able to open it, and this problem does not occur when I try to open files that originated on my computer.  When I try to open the document, I get the following error message:\n\nWord experienced an error trying to open the file.\nTry these suggestions.\n* Check the file permissions for the document or drive.\n* Make sure there is sufficient free memory and disk space.\n* Open the file with the Text Recovery converter.\n\nTo resolve this, I tried having my friend paste the contents of the document into a new document, but I also wasn't able to open that file.

Specific usage depends on the structure of your JSON file, the accepted answer on https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/570548/convert-json-array-into-csv has details which should help to get started.\n\nIf you don't have or use Homebrew you do not need it in order the get jq, as a precompiled binary is available at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/.

For example, if you want to do this in Python, this search may help. A more language-neutral search may be to search github for JSON to CSV converters.\nI tend to do these things from the command line, or in small scripts. I've tried jq and I've tried Miller (akamlr). jq has a larger following, but I have a preference for Miller because I get results I need without too much effort... but YMMV. One other thing: If you decide to try Miller you should file this link to the \"Cookbook\" page for Miller... it's not advertised well, but I find it useful 'cause I'm a cook :)\n\nA: You can create a free account at Gigasheet and upload JSON files up to 10GB.

I use the  \"auto-offload app\" feature of iOS that uninstalls unused apps on my phone to free up storage.\nFor the most part this is really useful, but there are some apps which I use infrequently, and if they get offloaded they need to be reconfigured to work.

It seems to be all or nothing. I've taken to removing a lot of apps I rarely use manually, foregoing this utility, unfortunately.\nApple's official wording states: Automatically remove unused apps, but keep all documents and data. Reinstalling the app will place back your data, if the app is still available from the App Store.\nPerhaps you should write to the developer of CCTV Viewer if the setup/pairing data is not retained when the app is off-loaded and then re-installed.\nYou should also go to the Apple Feedback site for iPhone and make a feature request.

I heard that TikTok was banned in some countries and was found to be looking at user's clipboard data at times and possibly transferring or storing them some where. But it seems to me any OS could simply not allow the app to do that, be it macOS, Windows, or iOS... user can be copy and pasting in their email app, and when you go to another app, why should the OS allow any app to look into the clipboard data?\nIs there any reason for the operating system to allow programs to view the clipboard not in response to the paste command?\nWhat functionality is enabled by allowing programs to view the clipboard not in response to a paste command?\n\nA: If you want to keep the cut-n-paste functionality, programs will at some point eventually have to read the clipboard contents.\nThe operating system (on iOS or macOS) in general cannot know what the \"paste action\" actually is. In some programs it could be clicking/tapping an icon, it could be pressing a keyboard combination (not necessarily the standard one), or it could be programmatically triggered.\nHowever the operating system could trigger a popup asking the user whether to allow a paste operation, when the app accesses the clipboard contents. Or it could show some other indication that the clipboard is being accessed. This is what happens in iOS 14 with a small notification that the clipboard contents was copied.\nNote that the operating system cannot as such know whether this popup is being triggered after the user pressed/clicked \"Paste\", or there is some other reason!\nThere are other reasons for accessing the clipboard than purely \"paste\" operations. Some apps for example detect that you have in the clipboard and display certain actions for the user. For example if you have a link in your clipboard, and you start up a link manager app, it could offer easy access to add that link into its database.\nAnother example is the Facebook app that back in 2015 introduced an automatic \"share\" suggestion when you have a link in your clipboard.\nIn iOS 14, Apple has added functionality to allow app developers to ask if the clipboard contains a link that matches a certain pattern without actually accessing the clipboard contents and triggering the popup. This could allow apps to keep their helpful clipboard features without the same privacy impact.\n\nA: \nCould iOS disallow apps from looking at the clipboard?\n\nNo, it can't.\nSince iOS 14, it can display a warning.\n\nIs there any reason for the operating system to allow programs to view the clipboard not in response to the paste command?\n\nYes in an ideal world where any application would only\ndo legal things, and where a phone or computer was used\nby a unique user within the same work context (professional, private) it would help us to save time.\nIn any other case, this could easily lead to privacy\nviolation or company data leak or criminal data theft.\nFor example, after you copied an image, if you open Preview on a Mac, and it will read your clipboard and see you have pasted an image and offer you to create a new \"Untitled\" document from Clipboard. This function was conceived in an ideal world (the one where we don't need keys for car or house).\nIf this image is an unclassified document in an ideal world: no problem.\nOtherwise, many potential problem with some of them with consequences which could be prosecuted (confidential information leak).\n", "Q: Does iOS allow any app to look at the clipboard data? As far as I know, there should be a way so that the clipboard data is only provided to the app when it is user initiated. My question is: does iOS actually allow any app to look at the clipboard's data even when it is not user initiated. Is it a fact, or is it not?\n\nA: The whole purpose of clipboards is that apps can read from it and write into it. Usually this happens due to a copy/paste request by the current users, but there are apps (e.g. Podcast apps or browsers) which peek at the clipboard to see whether it is in a any form actionable by the app (e.g. if it is an URL). And there are, as recent news show, apps which seem to peek into the clipboard to grab data, passwords etc.\nIf you are curious about how code to access the clipboard can look like, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41452868/reading-from-the-clipboard-with-swift-3-on-macos gives some examples.\n\nA: iOS supports not only the general clipboard (technically, the general UIPasteBoard), but also named UIPasteBoards.\nAs the Apple docs explain regarding named UIPasteBoards:\n\nYou can create named pasteboards with the class methods init(name:create:) and withUniqueName() for sharing data within your app and from your app to other apps that have the same Team ID.\n\nApps that want to better protect data that users may have pasted into the clipboard, would use named UIPasteBoards rather than the general one, to prevent any random app from accessing its contents.\nTheoretically, on a jailbroken device, other apps may still be able to gain access even to your app's named UIPasteBoard, so the app may still want to implement other measures like encrypting data before transferring it to the clipboard (whether general or named UIPasteBoard).\n\nA: There's a longer answer but the short answer is yes. Any running app can access the clipboard.\n", "Q: Where does macOS really install the SF Pro Text fonts?

And where you can find it? Including the Emoji font?\nIt's not on the /Library/Fonts folder then where is it really?\n\nA: Yes, its located at System/Library/Fonts.  There are several versions for different uses. SF-Pro for macs, and iPads, SF Compact for iWatch. And a third one for the terminal called SF-mono\nApple has a very restrictive license for these fonts.

A week ago it started repeatedly rebooting about two minutes after boot. When booted it shows battery at 3% or 4% but once showed it at 100% (though it still shut down after a minute or two).\nApple tells me that for iPads they don't actually replace your battery. It's too hard because the screen is glued on. Instead they swap out the whole iPad. Thus, I can't just say \"Please replace the battery. Here's $99.\" They replied with \"We have to replace the whole iPad. That will be either $99 or $599 depending on whether the problem is the battery or something else.\"\nAt the Apple store it wouldn't boot on a standard 1.5A (7.5W) charger or from a portable battery (wattage unknown). It required the 3.6A (18W) charger from an iPhone 11 Pro to boot at all. Once booted we were unable to run the diagnostic because it would power down too quickly. But we were able to go into settings and look at the log of kernel panics. The most recent panic was five days before the Apple store appointment, and the phone had shut down and rebooted at least 20 times since then, including four or five times in the Apple store. So these shutdowns were not being caused by kernel panics, which the Apple tech said they would be if this were a hardware problem, not a battery problem.\nHowever, he ultimately declared this to be a hardware problem, not a battery problem because he said he looked in some document that said that this iPad model would draw its power directly from the charging wire, rather than the wire charging the battery and the iPad drawing from the battery. Thus, if it's plugged in and still won't stay running, the battery is not the problem.\nThis is a really big deal because replacing the iPad due to the battery costs $99 and replacing the iPad for any other reason costs $599. I think the tech's conclusion is wrong and it's unfair to make me pay $599 for a bad battery. How can I convince them that the battery is failing so I can get the $99 price?\n\n*\n\n*What document would the tech have read that said that about drawing power from the charging cable? Can anyone find a document to the contrary? I don't think this argument is valid because I replaced the battery of a 2013 Macbook Air. Before the battery replacement the battery had to be charged for about 10 minutes before it would boot, and then it would run all day while plugged in. So even though it was drawing its power generally from the cord it still required some amount of functioning battery to boot. Once I replaced the battery it would boot instantly when plugged in, even if we had run the battery down to where the machine shut off.\n\n\n*The tech expected to find kernel panics in the analytics and said that these would indicate it was a hardware problem, not battery. He was surprised to not find them, but then changed his argument to the charging cable one. Do kernel panic logs always show up after a kernel panic? If an iPad shuts down spontaneously without leaving a kernel panic log, why is that happening? Any reason besides dead battery?\n\n\n*This iPad seems to draw a lot of current. Back when it worked, if battery was half full and iPad was being used while plugged into a 1.5A (7.5W) charger we would generally see the battery level go down, not up. This would be unheard of on an iPhone, where using it while charging is the norm. As I see it, what's happening now is that it's drawing all the current its power circuitry allows for a device of this era (2015 before \"fast charging\") and is supplementing this with battery. But since the battery has failed, it can only do this for a minute or two and that's why it shuts down. Getting a new battery would allow it to run for many hours while plugged in or not plugged in.\n\n\n*How many amps can this iPad actually draw while plugged in? How many amps can it draw from battery?\n\n\n*The fair way to resolve this would be to actually replace the battery. If that fixes it, I pay $99. If it doesn't, I pay $599. But Apple is unwilling to actually replace the battery of this iPad and instead only offers replacement. This is unfair since it prevents us from establishing the truth that the battery was the problem.\n\n\n*Since going to the Apple store when plugged into a 3.6A (18W) charger it now begins booting to the Apple logo and then shuts down after 30 seconds. It never gets to a normal screen. I would argue that the battery is holding even less of a charge so it's not supplementing the charger power as long as it was before.\nAnyone have other thoughts or ways to frame my position to help me get treated fairly here?\nThanks.\n\nA: I hate to say it, but it's probably not the battery.\n\nHowever, he ultimately declared this to be a hardware problem, not a battery problem because he said he looked in some document that said that this iPad model would draw its power directly from the charging wire, rather than the wire charging the battery and the iPad drawing from the battery. Thus, if it's plugged in and still won't stay running, the battery is not the problem.\n\nThis is probably true. If you want to prove it one way or the other, you'll need to find an even higher-current charger. Any USB-C Apple charger with a USB-C to Lightning cable should work. A 96W MacBook Pro charger will certainly lay the question to rest. (This is fine.) If it runs on that, it's the battery. But if it doesn't, then it's not the battery.\n\nA: If it’s really the battery, using it will make the battery diagnostics show use and wear over time. Just move on and use it for 30 or 45 days and ask for a check up on the diagnostics.\nYou can also pay a third party to repair the battery only. You don’t have to force Apple to do that work if they are unwilling to give you a price break on the cost of an exchange and supply an already repaired device which is what the $99 price point entails.\n\n*\n\n*https://locate.apple.com/\nLastly, check if you have a third party service option or warranty extension via your purchase method. Often a credit card will set up “double the warranty” so you could seek one year service from them on the second year of ownership. Apple would cover this $600 repair in the first year, so maybe you have coverage for another party to pay the estimated cost.\nThat last option is more likely to work if your iPad isn’t 4.5 years old, but checking won’t coast you much time. Everything you describe seems the tech did a ton of diagnosis for free and gave you a very fair shake, but heading back for a second opinion a few months down the road is always a good option IMO.\nIn the case of OP it looks like getting a second opinion later via the phone after gathering more data was all that was needed:\n\nwhen I called support and described the fact that it wouldn't boot at all without the 18W charger, but would boot with it he agreed that the problem was obviously the battery so I got to do the $99 exchange\n\n", "Q: Will BigSur Beta update do a fresh install or upgrade Catalina? when you install the BigSur Beta, does it upgrade the current installation of Catalina (if there is one) or will it always to a fresh install?\nBest\n\nA: It should always be an upgrade.\n", "Q: Disable Terminal man page shortcut on Catalina I recently upgraded to MacOS Catalina and when I am in IDEA IntelliJ, if I press Command + Shift + M the OS opens the Terminal program and attempts to load the man page for whatever I had highlighted in the editor at that time, as described here.\nThis is very annoying because I already have that keyboard shortcut mapped to something else in IntelliJ that I use quite frequently.

My problem is with WhatsApp itself. I know that modern browsing is RAM intensive (specially webapps built with Electron), but we close and open tabs all the time, which compensates for the RAM usage. But, for instance, my WhatsApp Desktop App (a glorified browser tab) is open ALL the time since it is a major work and personal tool for my digital life, and sacrificing 1GB of RAM for a communication application seems like overkill to me.\nIt consumes around 600MB to 1GB depending on its usage.\nWhatsApp Renderer GPU is the most RAM intensive task.\nI created an Automator App that runs this terminal command (I saw it here):\nopen /Applications/WhatsApp.app/ --args --disable-gpu\n\nBut it stills open WhatsApp with the GPU renderer.\nI would like to ask what could I do to force WhatsApp to be less RAM intensive or how to I stop making it use my GPU (since the terminal command above did not work).\n\nA: You can use web version instead of desktop version.\n", "Q: Locating the iBooks folder in iCloud Drive (on Windows) I need to get the iBooks that are saved in iCloud Drive, using Windows, in a folder path and / or command line solution.\nThis is a spin-off from Locating the iBooks folder in iCloud Drive which only has answers for Apple macOS command line (macOS bash), while I need this for Windows.\n\nA: Summing up the answer in advance: the folder simply might not exist on Windows.\nAnd the workaround in advance:\nIf I cannot locate the folder, the only solution is via extraction from the iTunes backup, see:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/62434692/iphone-move-in-one-go-all-pdfs-generated-from-safari-page-prints-which-i-fr/62701384#62701384\n\nI found a description that explains the equivalent Windows and Mac folders at https://deciphertools.com/blog/how-to-backup-ibooks-pdfs/.\n\nWhere are My iBooks PDFs Stored on my Computer?\n\n\nOn Windows, the iBooks PDF files copied to your iTunes by doing\nTransfer Purchases are stored in your computer user's account folder,\nalongside your iTunes music.

Memory Pressure is high and its hard to use computer. Why is this? I have a mid-2010 iMac running High Sierra. It has started getting very sluggish several times a week. I have tracked it down to the memory pressure and the process kernal_task. Shown below is a screenshot of the activity monitor when this occurs.\n\nAs you can see the process kernal_task is using 9.43 GB of memory.  This usually lasts 20 or 30 minutes. The kernal_task will occasionally drop to 5.46 GB and then sometimes down to 1.6 GB at which time the memory pressure is small and it turns green and my machine will return to normal.\nThe next image is of the Activity Monitor showing CPU usage. Kernal_task is not using a lot of CPU but has been running for quite a while.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of what is happening?\nI've tried restarting my computer and quitting all open apps when it gets sluggish. Restarting the computer worked but eventually it gets sluggish again.  Restarting every time this happens is a real pain. Quitting the open apps seems to have no effect. The final image below shoes the memory pressure when things return to normal.\n\n\nA: A dying a hard drive will actually cause this symptom as the system \"waits\" for read/write operations to complete.  It'll eventually get there, but often times, it will crash.\nFrom the comments, you've confirmed this with the SMART status saying \"Failed\" which means that drive literally has one foot in the grave and slowly putting the other one in now.\n\nI just hate putting money into my old computer.\n\nI can't agree more.

I'm into this for about $40 (a little horse trading on ebay helps) and everything works - Ethernet, Bluetooth, external display, and even WiFi!

Something goes wrong and it confuses launching the application with changing the folder contents, and triggers the indexing process without the real reason. (the implementation is broken anyway, because obviously taking most of the RAM for a background process and effectively killing the performance can't be intentional. But you can consider yourself lucky with 16 GB of RAM - my mac mini was routinely being halted for an hour or two whenever the mac os decided it is time to take 12GB(!) of its 8GB for the pointless indexing task.)\nHow did I solve the problem? Unfortunately, I can no longer find the website that helped me save my machine last year, but if I recall correctly, I have deleted the contents of helpd cache, like this:\nrm ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpd/*\n...then restart.\nIf I am mistaken, perhaps it might have been some other cache, but at least you have a new hypothesis to investigate.

When I try to move the cable, change the power cable to a different USB slot nothing helps. The battery indicator is in charging state, but when pressed, it says \"Not charging\". After some time, when it gets to 88-92% it suddenly starts charging again.\nI noticed that this happens independently of loads. Once or twice a day. This can happen when 2 IDE, browsers windows, media player are running simultaneously, and when it is in idle state showing only desktop. I'm using native 85Watt charging block and cable.\nAdditional info:\nIn System Report -> Power, the Condition is displayed as Normal. With cycles count equal to 52. This used to happen even when the condition used to be better, with fewer cycles count. But less frequently.\n\nA: This is normal behavior.\nThe key to your question is your estimation:\n\nAfter some time, when it gets to 88-92%\n\nThat is right at the line (93%) where Apple estimates that charging will appear to stop.  A couple of percentage points is well within the margin of error and it's safe to say it wasn't a scientific observation you were making.\nFrom Apple Support: About Mac notebook batteries\n\nMy battery won't charge to 100%\nOccasionally, the battery might not show a full charge (100%) in macOS, even after the power adapter has been connected for an extended period of time. The battery might appear to stop charging between 93 percent and 99 percent. This behavior is normal and will help to prolong the overall life of the battery.\n\nThe thing is, depending on use, it may go a little lower than 93%.  Most things done with battery is done based on calculation of what's measured so 93% is a calculation.  The point is, a hard 93% would not be that the demarcation of when to start charging.  Like everything else, it is based on the measurement; and in this case, most likely the measurement of the remaining charge and max charge values read directly from the battery itself and not a calculation displayed by the OS.\nRegarding Catalina\nCatalina introduced a Battery Health Management feature  and released it to the public June 1st 2020 in the 10.15.5 Update.  The Support article I sourced the info from above is from May 26th, 2020 (Pre-Catalina, see image below).\n\nApple has a habit of not dating things or just showing you when things were updated so, took a screen grab for posterity\nIt's also been in the public beta for some time judging by the ample blogs/articles written about it.  Now, it wouldn't be uncommon for Apple to implement a portion of the the feature (like changing the max charging limit) into earlier versions of macOS.  The full \"Battery Management\" feature allows you the ability to control it.\n\nA: This feature was introduced in macOS Catalina, on by default. Are you sure you're actually on Mojave?\nIt's supposed to prolong your battery life, you can disable it in Energy Saver -> Battery Health.\nMore info here\nPS: would comment, but don't have reputation\n\nA: I have a similar issue while using a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) running Catalina (10.15.x). What I've discovered is that my USB dock is the problem. I am using a Sicotool dock which has several USB ports, a USB-C port, ethernet and some display ports. I have everything connected to this dock (monitor, two USB drives, ethernet, power) so I have an easier time plugging in just one cable. What I believe is happening, the dock overheats. When I notice that my laptop is no longer charging while plugged in, an unscientific test of the temperature (by touch) indicates to me that the dock has grown too hot and some how shuts off the flow of power (or maybe it's the laptop itself). What I do is unplug my USC-C power from the dock, plug it in directly to the laptop for a while and then after the dock cools down, I can return the power cable to dock. This happens about once a month for me on average.\nI have also had some success with just unplugging everything from the dock, unplugging the dock from the laptop and then reconnecting everything to enable the power to flow again. Not sure if that resets any hardware/software running in the dock.\n\nA: Update 2020-08-05: It's a new feature by Apply and intended behavior\nsee HT211246\n\nIf you see 'Not Charging' when your Mac notebook is connected to power\nDepending on its settings, your Mac might temporarily pause charging to help calibrate battery health management, a feature designed to improve the lifespan of your battery.\n\n\nIf your Mac notebook has Thunderbolt 3 ports and uses macOS Catalina 10.15.5 or later, you can use battery health management to help extend the life of your battery. Battery health management is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and charging patterns.\n\n\nWhen battery health management is turned on, you might occasionally see ”Not Charging” in the battery status menu of your Mac, and your battery's maximum charge level might be lowered temporarily. This is normal, and it's how battery health management optimizes charging. Your Mac resumes charging to 100 percent depending on your usage.\n\nThis is a new behavior, in my opinion – and might be a bug (see update)\nI have not noticed this behavior till recently (see below). I cannot remember observing a noticeable/quick discharge while connected to the power supply, and when this started to happen I thought the laptop is broken or the SMC/nvram corrupt…\nWhat is happening now is that the Laptop (in my case also a MacBookPro 15\" 2018) stops charging for a period of time (around 1 h). Maybe till it reaches ~93% remaining charge and then starts charging again.\nI have noticed this since installing the 002 or 003 security update on High-Sierra, I have then tried a lot to troubleshoot this new behavior, updated to Mojave (with all updates), reset the nvram and power management but the issue persists.\nThe screen-shots below, from the iStat menu sensor data recording, show how the battery is draining (while still connected to the power supply). The DC input from the power supply is reduced to 2 W (20 V at 0.1 A) and power is (mainly) drawn from the battery.\n\nabove: Battery charge drops to ~93% while connected to power supply\n\n\nabove: The battery powers the system, although it's connected to power supply\n\n\nabove: Power input from the connected power supply\n\nThis only happens when the laptop is awake and always at the same time of day. When it is not awake at that time it will start draining the battery the moment it is awake.\nThis continues to happen with different chargers and when booting to recovery mode, and - I think - when booting an older system from external drive.\nI suppose that maybe something in the SMC code was changed, which triggers this behavior independent from the OS.\nAll in all this new behavior has perplexed me quite a bit.\nI do not see how a daily forced discharge to 93% can prolong the overall life of the battery!\nRight now Apple is forcibly adding one full discharge/charge cycle about every two weeks, or ~25 full cycles per year. Maybe (and I hope so) they have done some research and determined that this behavior actually prolongs the battery-lifetime – on the other hand this might just be a bug…\n\nUpdate 2020-08-05: It's not a bug but \"a feature designed to improve the lifespan of your battery\", according to Apple\nThe way Apple back-ported this behavior to High-Sierra and Mojave, where there is no \"Battery health management\" in System Preferences/Energy Saver still makes me wonder if this is working entirely as intended.\n", "Q: Only download new email on Apple Mail app on macOS Is it possible to set up a new email account on Apple Mail app on macOS and only have it download new emails from the time it was set up on the Mail app?\nI want to have a fresh start with an existing email address but I don't want to delete any of my old emails.\nQuestion: how do I add an email address to the Mac Mail app and only have it display new emails?\n\nA: Make Use of the Archive Function\nIn Apple Mail, you can Archive mail that you no longer need immediate access to, but you don't want to delete.\nSee the Apple Support Document:  Archive emails in Mail on Mac\n\n\nI want to have a fresh start with an existing email address but I don't want to delete any of my old emails.\n\nThis is exactly what Archive will do.  You will have a nice, fresh start with your In-Box, but you wouldn't have deleted any of the existing email messages.  If you ever need to search for them again, they are readily available.\nIn my personal workflow, I archive everything older than 365 days (you can set up a rule, but that's a different question).  The other day, I needed a Serial Number for a scanner I purchased 2 years earlier and was able to find it within a couple of seconds.

For my home network, I am still using the Time Capsule 4th Generation Router, from 2011.\nI realized that I may have overestimated the security of this device, as it apparently does not have a Firewall – it only has NAT.\nI am concerned about the security aspect, since my Time Capsule is connected immediately to my apartment building's fiber optic network, which provides Internet access.\nBehind the Time Capsule, I have several computers with software firewalls, and iOS devices which I assume also have software firewalls.

Absolutely.  Unequivocally Yes.\nThreats have evolved significantly since 2011 when that Time Capsule came out and quite frankly, are woefully ill-equipped to deal with the current threats.\nI don't use \"retail/consumer grade\" routers that you get at your local big box house.  I use pfSense running on a USFF Dell machine (Core 2 Duo, 8GB RAM and 32GB SSD) configured with an Intel Quad Gig interface.

You can start with a cheap PC you pick up on eBay, Craigslist, Gumtree, etc.  For home, it doesn't need to be fancy.  2GB RAM is more than enough but the more RAM, the more \"states\" the router can handle.  You'll need a NIC since the computer will come with one, you just need another (one for WAN the other for LAN).  I found (on eBay) SSDs used in thin clients and bought 5 for under $40 (good to have extras on hand).

You can make all lines align their left borders equal and it will allow gaps on the right at the end of a line to continue onto the next line. You can also align your writing so that every line is flush to both the left and right borders. Pages will vary the spacing between words to fit all words on a line.\nI've tried both options many times and there is no hyphenation involved. Another option, flush borders on the right will just allow large gaps at the beginning of a line. Again there is no hyphenation.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my spouse and an updated CV.  She added her most current position with Pages under iOS using her iPAD.  The document was FULL of hyphenations.  There is NO way currently to turn Hypenation ON or OFF using Pages for iOS.

How can I remove drivers/sound output device so it is not visible as an option? Few things I have already tried\n\n*\n\n*Checked /library/audio/hal - nothing to delete here\n\n*Checked the monitor for any options to disable the speakers and broadcaster as a sound output device. Nothing. All I can do is mute.\n\nI am on Mojave. Any help or guidance much appreciated. Thanks.\n\n\nA: The problem here is that HDMI carries audio.  Period.  When you plug in your monitor to your Mac via HDMI it's going to detect that there's an audio device attached.  And, like you said, all you can do is mute, but mute has no effect because it doesn't remove the (audio) device; it just lowers the volume to zero.\nThe second problem is macOS.  It assumes that whatever the latest audio device you plug in is the one you want to use.  FreeBSD allows me to enumerate my audio devices then using /etc/sysctl.conf tell it which one I want as my default.  macOS has no provision for this.\n(This is one of the things that drives me nuts about macOS - it assumes I did one thing, so I must want this other thing to happen.  It's like an Apple engineer resurrected Clippy from a bit bucket somewhere). <\\rant>\nThere are two ways to attack this:\n\n*\n\n*Don't use HDMI.  The specifications page for your monitor state that it has mDP (mini DisplayPort), HDMI, and DisplayPort inputs.  Use either of the DisplayPort inputs instead (you'll get better performance and reliability anyway). I've found that most monitors don't carry the audio even though DP has the ability to do so.  I'm guessing monitor manufacturers assume you want to use it as a computer display.\n\n\n*Use an HDMI audio extractor/de-enabler.  This will allow you to intercept the audio signals in your HDMI cable and \"remove\" them for redirection elsewhere (i.e. SPDIF port on a home theater).  If the end device doesn't present as an audio device as HDMI, there won't be anything to switch two.\nPersonally, I would go with the first option.  It's the easiest and least complex way to achieve this - it's just a cable.\n", "Q: The file system shows there is a user, \"_mysql\", that I cannot \"su\" as root. What is basically going on so I can get mysqld running again The following shell command sequence makes me realize I don't understand something very basic about how user and group accounts works on MacOS:\n\n/tmp$ whoami\njondoe\n/tmp$ cd /usr/local/mysql/data\n/usr/local/mysql/data$ ls -l | grep mydatabase\ndrwxrwxrwx 55 _mysql  _mysql 1760 Jun 24 2019 mydatabase\n/usr/local/mysql/data$ su\nPassword:\n/usr/local/mysql/data# su xxxx\nsu: unknown login: xxxx\n/usr/local/mysql/data# su _mysql\n/usr/local/mysql/data# whoami\nroot\n/usr/local/mysql/data#\n\nsummary: The file system shows that the mysql installation created a user account and group account both called: \"_mysql\". Yet, when I am root, and \"su\" that account, I remain the root user.\nwhy do I care? I ran my database fine using El Capitan. Then, I upgraded to Catalina, and now I'm having trouble (I think permission) with running mysqld. And, as a general \"best practice\", I think you are suppose to minimize the number of things running as root on your machine, yet _mysql and root sort of look like the same account. Of course, I really just want my db running again and understanding the _mysql could lead to this.\n\nA: My mysql database (5.6.23) became unable to start when I upgraded from El Capitan to Catalina (10.15.5). Now it works. This is what I did, but its possible some of this might not be needed or a recommended thing to do:\n\n/tmp$ su\nPassword:\n/tmp# cd /usr/local/mysql/data\n/usr/local/mysql/data# chown _mysql:_mysql *\n/usr/local/mysql/data# chmod 777 *\n/usr/local/mysql/data# exit\n/usr/local/mysql/data$ cd /tmp\n/tmp$ sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start &\n\nOne major error was that \"/usr/local/mysql/data/JonDoe-MacBook-Pro.local.pid could not be created\". And that was resolved by the chown and chmod commands I think. Before the chown, the user was root and group was wheel for files, but not directories, in /usr/local/mysql/data.\n(#1) this does not start the server\n\n/tmp$ su\nPassword:\n/tmp# cd /usr/local/mysql/support-files\n/usr/local/mysql/support-files# ./mysql.server start &\n\n(#2) this does the server\n\n/tmp$ sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start &\n\nMy understanding is that option #1 and #2 should start the server in the exact same way. This added to my not understanding.\n", "Q: Is there a Recovery Key for encrypted external drives? When you encrypt your startup disk with FileVault, macOS gives you a recovery key. Does macOS also create one for external drives? If not, would it be possible to make it create one?\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nWhen you use FileVault, you are encrypting the entire boot volume, not just a single volume or folder.\nIf you're looking for something where you can encrypt a removable volume (i.e. USB drive), take a look at VeraCrypt where it allows you to have both password and keyfile authentication.  It's also cross platform which is definitely a plus.\n", "Q: Syncing photos Android -> Mac I would like to accomplish the following, which, in today's technological ecosystem, seems like it should just happen anyway:\n\n*\n\n*I take a photo on my Android phone\n\n\n*The phone uploads it somewhere automatically (presumably Google Photos)\n\n\n*My Mac downloads it automatically into a folder\nIn other words, I want the photos on my android device to seamlessly appear in a folder on my Mac, without me needing to do anything besides take the photo.\nI have Google Drive installed, but my photos don't seem to be there. I tried installing \"Google Backup and Sync\", but it crashed immediately and I can't get it to work. (I'm on OS X 10.11, so maybe that's why. I don't intend to upgrade until I get a new machine.) I've head that Google Backup and Sync is quite complex and fiddly to use anyway.\nIs there any other way that automatic photo sync between Android and Mac can be accomplished? If possible, I'd prefer not to use Dropbox, because mine is nearly full and I already pay for additional space on Google Drive, so I don't want to upgrade Dropbox as well.\n\nA: One way to accomplish this is with Microsoft OneDrive. The main barriers to this method are:\n\n*\n\n*You need a paid Office365 account to get the 1 TB storage\n\n*You need to be on Mac OS 10.12 or newer\n\nIt has the same functionality as Google Photos where you can have all your photos automatically upload from you phone. Then you can sync them to your computer using OneDrive for Mac.\nSounds like you weren't planning to upgrade Mac OS, but if you already have an Office365 subscription and the upgrade would make the difference, this could be an option.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina: Install Slows and Errors on MacBook Pro (13-inch Mid 2012) For around 6 months I had intermittent issues with my MacBook Pro (13-inch Mid 2012) where it was randomly ending up on the folder with a question mark icon, or the no-entry icon.\nIt used a 250GB Samsung 840 SSD - which I had installed in 2014 - and I figured it must have finally been at its end-of-life.\nI've replaced it with a 1TB Crucial MX500 SSD; the swap went smoothly and as expected.\nNow, I'm having problems installing macOS Catalina at all.\nAfter installing the new drive I did the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the latest macOS Catalina from the App Store on my iMac\n\n*Created a new Catalina Install drive using Terminal createinstallmedia\n\n*Booted from the USB on the MacBook Pro\n\n*Formatted the drive to APFS in DiskUtility\n\n*Used the macOS install button, accepting terms etc..\n\nThe installer gets to around 50% normally (in around 5 minutes), but then it slows down dramatically, with the estimated time floating around 5-7 minutes constantly.

I am getting the Folder with Question Mark Issue as soon i am booting my machine. After going through the recovery option (Opt + R) the mac is not detecting the hard-disk at all.\nWe are under the lockdown here so can't travel to nearby apple support, Can anyone please suggest how to check if its the SSD issue or the Unibody Cable Issue (if it exists in this machine) .\nshould i order SSD to USB converter from Amazon to check if my SSD is fine ?\nDevice: MacBook Pro 13″ Late 2013 256 GB SSD\n\nA: In this model the SSD 'stick' slots into a rised slot on the motherboard, there is no cable. So given that the SSD is not detected at all in Recovery mode, my take is that it is hardware: either the SSD itself or the motherboard power circuitry to the SSD slot. The only sure way that I know of to differientiate between the two possibilities is to open the Mac, remove the SSD (which is fairly simple, just one T5 screw), and put the SSD into either an existing MacBook Pro/Air (any of the two, years 2013-2015 will work) or an external adapter of the kind you mention and see if it works.\nNote that a USB adapter will have to be specifically for 2013-2015 MacBook Pro/Air SSDs to fit the SSD you have.\n", "Q: Photos always listed as most recent I have a few photos from one photo “shoot” that are always listed as most recent in the iPhone Photos app even though they were taken months ago.

If not, then you’ll need to review the database - fix options with Apple or reset your library that stores the ordering of photos.\nI would start with checking that the dates aren’t just not what you expect.

When I opened my 13-inch 2020 MacBook Pro, right out the box everything seemed rather small. I went into the display settings and noticed the display setting was set to the \"default.\" However, poking a bit further into this, I saw that the \"default\" software resolution was being recognized as 1440x900, which corresponds to a 2880x1800 panel @2x. This happens to be the panel resolution of the 15-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nHowever, my MacBook is the 13-inch variant, which has a panel resolution of 2560x1600. The software resolution should as a result be displaying 1280x800 as default, as that's exactly half of the panel's 2560x1600 native resolution.\n\nI checked on my late 2012 13\" Retina MacBook Pro (which has the same resolution display panel resolution and size), and it correctly identifies the default software resolution as 1280x800.\nI was having some display issues related to True Tone being intermittently enabled/disabled, so I called Apple Support. I brought up this issue and escalated it to a senior advisor. I tried to show these numbers to him, but he simply stated that the default is \"scaled higher than the panel supports since customers complain about text being too small.\" Which seems to be the opposite of my issue, since everything appeared smaller than it should be.\nI reset my NVRAM, but these issues still occur.\nIs my display panel faulty, communicating to the OS that it's a 15-inch panel instead of a 13-inch one? Could this possibly be related to the True Tone issues that I'm having?\n\nA: So it looks like all modern 13\" MacBook Pros do this. It has been confirmed in this MacRumors thread.\n\n*\n\n*This change was likely made with the recent thunderbolt 13\" MacBook Pros.\n\n*This was most likely done in order to allow the user to \"fit more\" into the relatively small 13\" screen by default.\n\nI find it strange for this to be the default resolution, because it is a fractionally scaled resolution. This means that the virtual pixels do not map perfectly to physical pixels. If the default scaling was set to the second box, as with older 13\" MacBooks, then a 1x1 block of virtual pixels would correspond exactly to a 2x2 block of physical pixels. With the new default scaling, this is not the case.\nThis leads to text which is slightly less sharp if you look at it up close. Why this change in default scaling was made, I don't know—perhaps Apple determined the loss in sharpness wasn't significant enough to discount it as a default option. Oh well, it's good to know anyway. At least my display isn't having an identity crisis.\n", "Q: Open new Chrome window with different profile from command line I want to run a command line that opens a new chrome window with another profile.\nI tested the following commands:\nPreconditions:\n\n*\n\n*I have two profiles: Profile 1 and Profile 2\n\n\n*Chrome is already running with Profile 1\nopen -a \"Google Chrome.app\" --args --profile-directory=\"Profile 2\"\nThe above command does nothing other than bringing focus to the currently running chrome with Profile 1\nI also tried:\nopen -a \"Google Chrome.app\" --args --profile-directory=\"Profile 2\" --new-window\nThe effect is the same.\nI want to run a command line that opens a new chrome window with Profile 2 while there is already a Chrome window running with Profile 1\n\nA: Pass the arguments to the  Google Chrome's executable directly, instead of routing them via open --args.\nSet an alias to the executable inside Chrome app. (right click > show package contents)\nalias chrome_cli=\"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\"\nchrome_cli --profile-directory=\"Profile 1\" --new-window\nchrome_cli --profile-directory=\"Profile 2\" --new-window\n\nEven append --new-window to the alias if that's used a lot.\nFor more help, run\nchrome_cli --help\n\nTo remove alias,\nunalias chrome_cli\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3773/how-to-pass-parameters-to-an-alias\n", "Q: How to turn off localhost web server I've discovered by accident that my Mac is running a localhost web server.

With Catalina (10.15.5), file system updates are not reflected in the Finder windows until several minutes later. That is, I can rm a file and it will still show up in the corresponding Finder window for at least several minutes.\nHow should I go about diagnosing this behavior?\nCould any of the following be contributing to it, and if so, how?\n\n*\n\n*If the folder is on an SSD formatted with HFS+ rather than AFPS\n\n*Whether the folder is on a disk image and/or one with encryption\n\n*Whether there are 1000+ files in the folder\n\n*File sizes and/or types\n\nOne thing that does work is running disk first aid from Disk Utility or diskutil verifyVolume after any of these commands.\n\nA: Just to set a base line, I can say that my Catalina installation does not exhibit any such delay for updating Finder windows. Doing mv/copy/remove operations from the Terminal updates the Finder windows immediately.\nThis is on Catalina 10.15.5 on an encrypted APFS SSD, and works with any file size and file type (as far as I can tell).\n\nA: What I'd do as a first check would be to run ls -lrt directly after you remove a file and verify that way that the file is indeed gone. Or use this after moving a file and seeing how they do that way. Removing a file with rm should be an immediate action. Checking if it has indeed been removed should show up in the ls -lrt command. or if you do have a lot of files try\nls -lrt | grep filename\nand the file should be gone.\nThis will tell you if the delay is real\n", "Q: What is the purpose of the BSD pty/tty device files in /dev? I am on macOS Catalina.\nAs far as I can tell (reading man pty, man tty, parts of this wikipedia article, and this somewhat dated reference on ttys), these device files are no longer used.\nInstead, when one opens up Terminal.app, /dev/ptmx (pseudo terminal master multiplexer) dynamically creates a /dev/ttys### slave for the user to type command inputs. This is what one  sees when calling who.\nHowever, when I ls /dev, I see many pairs of these BSD style pseudoterminal files, that is, /dev/ttyXY and /dev/ptyXY where XY are a pair of characters. I believe there are 255 total pairs of these files.\n\n*\n\n*Is there any specific reason besides backwards compatibility that these files are on new versions of macOS? Any modern use cases?\n\n*If possible, how could I open one of these BSD PTY files, instead of /dev/ptmx, for general terminal use or with screen? When I tried to screen \\dev\\ttyw0, nothing happened, and xterm created another \\dev\\ttys###.\n\n*Why was the new ptmx system adopted? Just so I can create more than 255 terminal sessions simultaneously?\n\nEdit: related but different post.\n\nA: Backwards compatibility is the reason that these files are on the newest version of macOS. It is there to ensure that programs that expect this way of handling pseudo terminals still work.\nYou can open the /dev/ptyX# files the same way you would open /dev/ttys### files. You seem to have reversed the slashes in your command - please ensure that you are using forward slashes like this:\nscreen /dev/ttyw0\n\nNote that this in itself doesn't cause anything to happen. You have only connected to one end of the terminal pair. You would need to connect to other end as well to transfer some data.\nAs an example you could open one Terminal window and run the command above, and then open another Terminal window and run the command below:\nscreen /dev/ptyw0\n\nNow if you type something in one window, it appears in the other (and vice versa).\nThe main factor in adopting the ptmx system was that the old system is very complex for programmers to use correct. It looks deceptively simple, but when you get into it, you'll find that it is actually not.\nOne of the main problems is in determining which of the /dev/ttyXX files to actually use. I.e. you want to use one that is not in use by others. If you're not very careful, two programs that want to open a new pseudo terminal at the same time could both mistakenly think that the same terminal is not in use by others, and then both start using it - causing all sorts of problems. The ptmx system solves this problem.\n", "Q: Mac Shortcut Key Making Sound - What is it doing? (Or not doing) I am using a Mac (OSX 10.15 Catalina).\nRecently I have found that using the shortcut ( control ) + ( / ) causes my mac to make a system alert sound as if something was tried but didn't work...\nThe problem I have is that I can't determine what is assigned this shortcut and what it is trying to do (unsuccessfully it seems).\nI could probably live with it except that I use Apps Script IDE and the shortcut is useful there for commenting/commenting code.\nI have even paid for KeyCue but that hasn't uncovered anything...\n\nA: I know this doesn't answer the question, however, to prevent it from being buried, I figured I'd add it in.

When MacBook Pro 2018 is completely shut down, it will power up by simply opening the lid, pressing any key, or tapping the trackpad, which is very annoying. I managed to make it not power up when the lid is lifted, but I couldn't figure out how to prevent the key presses or trackpad tap from doing so.\n\nA: The Mac is shutting down and powering off, but newer Mac's include a feature that powers on when any key is pressed or the touch pad is touched.\nIf you need to stop this behavior--to clean the keyboard, for example--you can force a shutdown once.\nPress and hold the left Control and Command buttons with the right Shift button for a total of 7 seconds. Without releasing them, press the Power button and hold them all together for an additional 7 seconds. Your Mac can only be powered on by using the Power button.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to disable this permanently.\n\nA: Short answer: you can't\nMacBook Pro 2018 with Catalina 10.15.7\nMy experience is similar to Billie Hawkin's excellent answer above: setting AutoBoot to %00 prevents boot on lid open\nHowever, sudo shutdown -h now did not, in my experience, prevent the behavior. When any key is pressed, the laptop still booted up.\nWhat do service shops do? crack open the case and pull the battery!?\nAnd Apple Support was no help :P\n\nA: Just opinion: I don't think the computer is actually shutting down. The very nature of 'power off' would turn off USB/keyboard immediately.\nBy the behaviour you describe, the laptop is either going to 'sleep' or 'power nap' - and in either case, it's not shutting off.\nTo test this:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal in Mac OS (found in /Applications/Utilities/ folder)\n\n*Enter the following command syntax exactly:\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\n*Hit the return key and authenticate with an administrative password to immediately shut down the Mac\n\nThe Mac will immediately shut down. No data is saved and no dialogs are confirmed, the shut down happens instantly.\nWhen the lights go out, the keyboard should become unresponsive, and you would now know for sure the mac is shut off.\n\nEDIT: I realized that on my 2018 MBP, I had changed the \"lid-open to turn on\":\nDisable Boot on Lid Open / Power Connection on MacBook Pro (2016+)\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal, which is found in /Applications/Utilities/, and then enter the following command syntax exactly:\nsudo nvram AutoBoot=%00\n\n\n*Hit return and authenticate with the admin password (necessary due to sudo)\n\n\n*Exit Terminal when finished\nWith AutoBoot turned off, when the MacBook Pro lid is opened, it will no longer boot the computer or turn the computer on simply by opening\nthe lid.

Might try skipping the time machine backup and using Migration assistant directly Mac to Mac.\nOne more thought: old Mac used case-sensitive Apple File System, new Mac doesn’t - might that be the source of the „error“? Thanks for your help!\nSascha\n\nA: I want to commiserate because the exact same thing happened to me after using Time Machine to restore my drive recently after I put a new SSD in my older Macbook. The restore took a good amount of time and seemed successful according to the UI however I noticed that exact 2 folders you mentioned hadn't been restored. (I didn't notice anything else missing.) So I manually copied the contents from my backup and went along as usual...\nI ended up here however with a new issue; for other reasons I ended up getting a new machine a short time after that. I set up the new Mac using Migration Assistant with my Time Machine backup, which seemed successful this time. (all folders appear OK, although my Plex Media Server app database seems to be corrupted now).\nMy big problem now is that I went to restore that particular file from Time Machine, and see that I have no history  dating to before the migration! I looked at the backupd folder for Time Machine and it's now got a new folder where the new backups are being made named \"my username 2\"... the migration somehow forked me into a copy of my username, making my backup files longer accessible to Time Machine's UI.

All of my MacBook Pro 13\" 2017 backups are kept on my Toshiba External HDD. I decided to update my MacBook to macOS Big Sur developer beta (because I am a dev) and test it out. I backed my MacBook up onto my external hard drive before installing macOS 11 Big Sur beta, expecting to be able to use it just in case I need to go back to macOS Catalina.\nAfter I installed the beta:\nJust about a half a week ago, after using the drive completely fine in macOS Big Sur, I plugged in my external hard drive and found that it did not appear on my desktop or in Finder. I opened Disk Utility to find that the disk was displayed as not mounted. I tried to click Mount, which was not greyed out, and I received an error that the disk could not be mounted:\n\nCould not mount “TOSHIBA EXT”. (com.apple.DiskManagement.disenter error 0.)\n\nI automatically assumed that this was just a bug in the new beta update and I reported it to Apple. However, I soon came to find out it was also happening on another MacBook Air that has macOS Catalina 10.14.2 installed. So it was obviously not the beta, it was the disk.\nWhy exactly did this happen on a disk that was working perfectly fine the day before? Was the disk affected by something in the macOS Big Sur beta or is it a completely unrelated issue? I was searching for solutions for this issue and found that it was somewhat common, and that people recommend using DiskWarrior to repair the disk, however, I cannot justify spending $100 to repair a disk when I might as well just buy a newer and faster SSD. Are there any other cheaper and even free solutions to this?\nAnd in terms of data, I do not have data on the disk that is vital except for my MacBook Pro backups, which I was hoping to have on hand if something went wrong. If I bought a new drive, could I back up that from macOS Big Sur, erase Big Sur and install Catalina with the data from Big Sur?\n\nA: \nWhy exactly did this happen on a disk that was working perfectly fine, driving down the same road the day before?\n\nFor the exact same reason your car breaks down on the road when it was working perfectly the day before.  In other words C'est la vie.\nIs it your drive or the enclosure?\nNow, as to your situation, you've presumed that the drive went bad without ruling out the other factor - the enclosure itself. The USB port would be the third factor, but you automatically ruled that out by going to a different computer.\nThere's a very similar question to yours already posted:  External Hard Drive no longer working.  That one involves an enclosure and an SSD, not an HDD like yours, but the principles are the same.\nRecovering your data\nIt's a bit confusing as to what's exactly on the external drive - data or backups.  If it's backups, there's really no need to expend the time and money to recover something.  Get that external SSD and just continue making backups like you normally have.\nIf it's data - you need to determine what that data is worth to do.  For data recovery, I've used DiskDrill; it's absolutely free to scan and see if your files are recoverable and if they are the software is (IMO) reasonably priced at $90USD.  If your data needs to be recovered, it's a cheap price to pay to get it back - it's also a good reminder to back up your data wherever it exists; - on your boot drive and your external drives!\n\nA: In case your drive is not corrupted, there is a 3rd party app called Mountain that I use to mount drives that wont mount normally. The app is not free but comes with a free trial. To get the free trial go to the link I've included above.\n\nA: I'm by no means a computer specialist but think the issue is that you had your time machine backup and your drive probably got too full and ceased to work which is what happened to one of mine. I would keep a separate drive dedicated to time machine backups and your files on a separate drive. The drive will not work if its filled to capacity.\n", "Q: Why is zeroing out a drive with dd not working? I'm using macOS Catalina.\nI have a 16GB microSD card that had Raspbian on it, which is 2 partitions:\n\n*\n\n*45MB boot partition\n\n*large Linux partition\n\nI needed to clear it, so I plugged the SD card into my Mac and did this:\n$ sudo bash -c 'gdd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=4M; sync'\n\ngdd is the GNU version of dd, installed using homebrew.\n/dev/disk2 is definitely the right microSD card I'm zeroing out, confirmed with the Disk Utility.\nI use rdisk instead of disk because it's much faster, and points to the same disk.\nWhen the command starts running, the macOS Disk Utility shows the drive name change from \"boot\" to something like \"Generic Flash Device\" or something like that, so I know it's definitely doing something.\ngdd runs for a while, and after a few minutes, shows this:\ngdd: error writing '/dev/rdisk2': Input/output error\n3799+0 records in\n3798+0 records out\n15931539456 bytes (16 GB, 15 GiB) copied, 419.932 s, 37.9 MB/s\n\nThe error makes sense, since it tries to write zeroes to the microSD card until it runs out of space. At this point, the SD card should contain all zeroes. I've done this literally dozens of times on Linux. It never fails. I've even done this successfully on High Sierra dozens of times.\nWhat doesn't make sense to me is that as soon as the gdd process is done running, Disk Utility shows the SD card as \"boot\" again, it automounts at /Volumes/boot, and the files are still there.\nHow is it that gdd shows that it successfully wrote the entire SD card full of zeros, and yet the data is still there?\nUpdate: The Mac I was doing this on just happened to have VMware fusion on it, so I did this:\n\n*\n\n*Created a VM, attached Arch Linux ISO to it, and booted it\n\n*Attached the USB card reader device to the VM\n\n*Used dd in Arch to zero out the drive\n\nI shut down the VM, and the USB device reattached to the macOS. Exactly the same thing - the \"boot\" partition is still there, still auto-mounts, and has all the files there. What is going on?\nUpdate 2: I can't even seem to delete the partitions. I use the Arch VM, and either fdisk, or cfdisk to delete the 2 partitions on the SD card, it says it deleted them successfully, but as soon as I check again, the partitions are still there. The SD card is brand new. I'm not seeing any I/O errors reading from, or writing to it that would even suggest that its damaged.\nUpdate 3: I can't even delete the files. I mount either partition under Arch, use rm -rf * to delete ALL files on that partition, and ls shows that they are gone. I unmount the partition, and immediately mount it again, and all the files are still there.\n\nA: \nThe error makes sense, since it tries to write zeroes to the microSD card until it runs out of space.\n\nYou've misread the error.\ngdd: error writing '/dev/rdisk2': Input/output error\n\nThat means there was an error writing to the device.  The command you issued should do what you want - fill the drive with zeros, but this error says otherwise.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me is that as soon as the gdd process is done running, Disk Utility shows the SD card as \"boot\" again, it automounts at /Volumes/boot, and the files are still there. How is it that gdd shows that it successfully wrote the entire SD card full of zeros, and yet the data is still there?\n\ngdd did no such thing!  It gave you an I/O error message when it was writing to the device.  Your original files are there because nothing was written to the SD card.\nPossible causes:\n\n*\n\n*The card could be write protected\n\n*The card could be defective (especially if counterfeit - i.e. it reports 16GB but only has 2GB of actual storage)\n\n*The USB card reader could be defective\n\n", "Q: Is texting required for Apple Watch fall detection? The Apple Watch Series 4 and above fall detection function transmits your location after a fall.  Is this information sent as a text?  If I have a talk-only phone plan without texting, for example, would the location still be transmitted as part of the emergency call?\n\nA: None of this data is sent as an iMessage or SMS.\n\nIf I have a talk-only phone plan without texting, for example, would the location still be transmitted as part of the emergency call?\n\nIf you have a talk only plan with no texting (do those still exist?), it won't be able to send GPS location data at all.  How would it? \"Talk Only\" means just that - talk - there's no data whatsoever so it couldn't send location data.  It's a moot point anyway.\nThe way fall detection works is that after a fall has been detected and you haven't responded, it makes a voice call to the programmed emergency number and plays an audio message that includes latitude and longitudinal data.\nFrom Apple Support Use fall detection with Apple Watch\n\nWhen the call connects, your Apple Watch plays an audio message that informs emergency services that your Apple Watch detected a hard fall and then it shares your current location as latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, the location would be transmitted, as audio as part of the emergency call.\n", "Q: Failed to run VirtualBox on macOS 11 Big Sur I got this error when started a VM:\n\n\nA: Big Sur is a developer beta, not a public release beta.\nThe difference being is that it's released to software developers so they have a relatively decent platform to begin work on getting their applications compatible with the new release of macOS.  It's not meant for end users to gain access to the bleeding edge of macOS tech because you want the latest and greatest features.\nReport it!\nYou've gotten an error when trying to run VBox on Big Sur.  It's not ideal, but completely expected.  This is something you want to search for as an issue in Oracle's Bug Tracker; if it doesn't exist, you should probably report it.\nTesting is encouraged!\nIf you've decided to install Big Sur (or whatever the latest build is for future readers) on a production machine, I highly advise you to rethink that.  By \"production,\" I mean one you rely on for work.  It's the machine you turn on to get your work done that gets you paid so you can keep the lights turned on.  A Beta version can work just fine and a subsequent release can break things to the point where you're dead in the water.\nInstall it on a test Mac.  It could be a cheap Mac mini or even a broken LCD, busted keyboard or dead battery MacBook laptop.  You just want something inexpensive you can try out the new features on.  This would be my recommendation.\nIf that's not possible, create a second (or third, or nth) boot volume so that you can manually boot into the new OS, test and play to your hearts content and when you need to get back to work on a stable version of macOS, your original install is still there.  Remember to make copious backups.\n", "Q: Early 2015 13\" MacBook Pro Retina Won't Power On It worked fine prior to vacation, never used it while away, schlepped it in computer bag, only removed from bag at airport security on the way there, and again on the way back.\nI know the bag didn't get too hot because my candy bars didn't melt :-).\nPlugged it back in on its stand the next day and nothing happened when I pressed the power button.\nWhat, I've done so far:\n\n*\n\n*Opened the back, unplugged battery, can boot with battery disconnected while plugged into power, but runs slow due to no battery.\nThought maybe battery went bad even though it only had 3xx cycles, so bought iFixit kit and replaced the battery.\n\n\n*Still would not power up. Displayed the battery as made in 1979 at that time.\n\n\n*Watched Louis Rossmann video and cleaned out JTAG connector, booted normally, ONCE, after that, with full speed and good readings on CoconutBattery, (battery made in March 2020, 1 cycle).\nThe motherboard is not dirty at all, it lives on my desk on a stand, except when on vacation, but thought I saw small bits of solder between legs on JTAG under microscope, used tweezers to clean.  Would like to remove the connector, but don't really have the equipment to do so, it is way smaller than the boards I used to rework for Seagate back in the early 90s.\nIssues before and after battery replacement have been somewhat intermittent in terms of power connector LED and CoconutBattery readings.\nI have removed and reseated the part the MagSafe connector, connects to (power module?).  It's not dirty.\nI would hate to replace the logic board, but sending it for repair would be a similar cost to replacing it.\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?\n\nA: Have you tried the Apple Diagnostics?  This source has instructions for the Apple Diagnostics which are for machines after June 2013 so it should work on your computer.\nIf this doesn't help you and if you live near an Apple Store, take your computer to the apple store and just ask them to check it for you. Explain your problems and see what they say. Maybe they'll find the problem. Tell them you ran Apple Diagnostics but if offered no help.\n\nA: There's a rather large clue that the issue is the logic board:\n\nOpened the back, unplugged battery, can boot with battery disconnected while plugged into power, but runs slow due to no battery.\n\nThe moment you remove power coming from the battery side of things, your MacBook works (not at full performance, albeit).  There's very little chance it's the DC-In board (connects) to MagSafe because a) it boots with battery not connected, and b) it's charging.\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC.  The SMC is actually the PMU in every other laptop on the market.  There are very rare occasions to actually reset it (contrary to Apple diagnostic lore), but this is one:   you have a bona fide power issue.\n\n\n*Send in to Louis Rossman.  I've personally used his services (not affiliated, but very happy customer) and his pricing is roughly half of what it costs for a logic board replacement.  Your other option is:\n\n\n*Surf the secondhand market (eBay, Craigslist, LetGo, etc.) for a MacBook Pro of your vintage that is broken for some reason (LCD, battery, etc.). You may luck out and get a good logic board and given that you've got some electronic skills, part it out and recoup some funds.\n\n\n*Don't rule out the top case! (Until you can, of course). It may be failing and the power button is non-functional.  Since you're limited on tools, if you can get it to boot again, go into System Preferences → Energy Saver → Schedule and set a wake time for about 10 mins into the future.  If it boots, there's a good chance it's the top case.\nA few things:\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning/removing the JTAG connector won't hurt, but it won't help anything either.  It will just be an exercise in futility.\n\n\n*A \"dirty\" logic board won't affect function - it may contribute to heat issues, but it won't prevent it from booting.  That said, I always recommend cleaning with an air duster and replacing the thermal paste (cheapest Apple could find) with some quality stuff. Do that when you get it all sorted out.\n", "Q: Can I mount the root (system) filesystem as writable in Big Sur?

You can purchase Lion from Apple for 19.99 USD. However the website states you first have to have Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8) installed before installing Lion. AFAIK, Snow leopard is no longer available for purchase from Apple. It is possible to buy used copies of Snow Leopard and it is also possible to download free copies. Downloading a free copy would violate Apple's license.\nAll of this really does not matter, unless you have some really old OS X compatible software to use. Basically, Lion is to old to access the web and be compatible with any current software.\nOfficially, the most current version of Windows available for your model Mac is 32 bit Windows 7. However, you might be able to run 64 bit Windows 10, but with a processor speed under 2 GHZ and only 2 GB of RAM, I would expect Windows 10 would be sluggish to run.\n", "Q: Family Sharing, iCloud Drive I remember years ago, family sharing was a cool feature but I didn't get involved with it as I didn't like the fact one had to share the same credit card / payment method, across all accounts.\nThus if I added my Wife and Son to my family sharing, they would both be using my card whenever they made purchases.\nThis was years ago, recently I moved to the 2TB iCloud Drive plan, and I'm now interested in sharing that resource, but only if I can keep our accounts/payment/files self-sovereign.\nI searched for authoritative documentation, but can't see any.\nIf I just shared iCloud Drive, can I keep these aspects separate per user, whilst sharing my space?\n\nA: Yes, when you set up family sharing it will ask what you want to share. You can share iCloud storage space without enabling purchase sharing, which does still require the family account organizer pay for the family purchases.\nHere you can see I’m sharing iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, and Purchase Sharing is not enabled.\n\n", "Q: Panic report for Macbook Pro (retina 15-inch late 2013) macOS Mojave 10.14.6 I'm getting the black screen error which leads to a computer reset.

I began to do a straight copy from another SSD (Sata), both connected via USB-C, the transfer was working fine, then froze. I cancelled the transfer, and the finder bar froze on \"stopping\". It was frozen for a while and eventually the entire Mac crashed.\nAfter a restart, the new SSD (NVMe) would not appear, not in Disk Utility, Terminal or System Information. All that would appear in System Information was the enclosure with the name \"JMS583\". The SATA drive worked as normal. I physically reset the drive in it's enclosure, and it had no effect. Eventually I connected it to my old Macbook Pro 13\" via USB-C to USB-A and it appeared. I re-formatted it and successfully copied everything across.\nHowever, the drive still refuses to appear on my new laptop over USB-C, it only appears when connected to a USB-A port on my HyperDriveNet (which then converts to USB-C). If I connect to a USB-C port on the HyperDriveNet (USB-C to USB-C) it does not appear.\nI've tried repairing via terminal over USB-A and it's had no effect. I've seen similar posts here and here. But nothing has helped. I unfortunately have no access to another USB-C laptop to check whether it's my laptop (I would not be surpised, Catalina and the MacbookPro 16\" have been a real disappointment) and I would rather see if it can be solved without buying an additional enclosure/drive.\nWhat I have gathered from my attempts is that...\n• The SSD, enclosure and format will work with my mac, as seen over USB-A.\n• The mac is detecting the enclosure over USB-C, just not the actual storage (\"JMS583\")\n• The drive as a whole has worked before over USB-C as seen on the first attempt that led to a crash.\nCould something have happened in that crash that meant it will no longer be seen over USB-C. I've pre-ordered an OWC thunderbolt enclosure... But waiting till August is not really an option.\nAny help much appreciated!\nThanks\n\nA: I had the same issue. You need an NVME enclosure that has the ASM2362 chipset and not the Jmicron JMS583 chipset.

I’ve seen lots of tutorials online explaining how to convert iOS HEIC files to JPEGs but I can’t seem to find any easy way to bulk convert existing JPEG photos to HEIC?\nThe reason being is I really like HEIC as a storage format: It easily makes image file sizes 5x to 10x smaller than JPEG equivalents which not only saves space but makes syncing the library to other devices quicker as well.\nSo I would like to convert all past images in my macOS Photo library to HEIC two take advantage of these benefits. Do any such tools exist?\nWhile I understand how to bulk convert images outside of macOS Photos using ImageMagick and simple Bash scripting, I would like to avoid doing a bulk export, conversion via non-Photos tools and then reimport because that seems messy at best.\nI mean Apple is really promoting the use of HEIC within their apps nowadays; why not have some way to easily do that within the macOS Photos application itself?\n\nA: Unless somebody writes a plugin to manipulate photos in place, converting all the JPGs outside of Photos, deleting them from the library and then reimporting seems to be the only way. Which of course means that you loose all the albums etc.\nAs for a plugin, I wouln't be surprised if this is nearly impossible to do as plugins usually manipulate just the content of a photo, they change neither file type nor file name.

Asking Apple directly or discussing the DTK on the private boards Apple has for DTK is the best way to get actual experience and not guess work or people gaslighting you that don’t have first hand experience.\nI would apply direct to Apple and then wait or contact Apple via developer support after a couple weeks minimum.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/\nThere’s not much you need the DTK for today so build your app and ship updates.

I have a two new microSD cards and I'm going to use them for overflow storage and Timemachine using macOS Catalina.\nThey have exFAT now.\nQ. Is there any advantage to formatting them in any other format?  Specifically looking at safety as I've lost files on another microSD that is using exFAT.  The files were lost, yet the drive was still seen and some files came back.  So I'm looking for any file system that is safer or can recover lost files better than others.\n\nA: Yes, different file system have different advantages.\nReliability:\nFor example if you compare your current ExFAT with the macOS standard file format APFS or the older HFS+, you could gain several advantages by switching:\nIn terms of safety against \"lost files\" (where the drive is actually still good) both APFS and HFS+ have the advantage of being journaled file systems. This means that they track changes to metadata (i.e. not the file contents) in a form of log on the drive.\nThis means that if a data transfer is not completed due to for example power loss, yanking out the drive or software error, then the file system can \"roll back\" the change using the information from the log. Essentially this means that although the file transfer didn't succeed, you wouldn't end up with a corrupted drive and lost access to your files.\nIf the card is physically damaged or \"broken\" then no software file system can fix that of course - that's worth keeping in mind. Always keep backups (this is true of any storage medium).\nNote that there's a big difference in the quality of SD-card. Don't buy the cheapest ones - they're usually not that reliable. However you can actually get very reliable SD-cards - they're just in a different price range. I've been using industrial SD-cards for many years in a commercial setting where they're exposed to high and low temperatures, vibrations, high endurance  (i.e. SLC instead of MLC), etc. and you really need high quality SD-cards in those cases. I've had good experience with cards from Cactus.\nCompatibility:\nOne of the disadvantages of APFS/HFS+ is that they're not natively supported by for example Windows. If you try to use the SD-card with Windows, the files won't show up without installing extra drivers and support software.\nRegarding your desire to use Time Machine, remember that this requires the drive to be formatted as HFS+ on Catalina or older. On Big Sur you can use APFS.\nSafety:\nIn terms of safety in a broader perspective, the APFS file system supports full disk encryption. This means that you could have the data on your SD-card encrypted while using it as any other SD-card. If the SD-card is lost at some points, others would not be able to your read your data without your passphrase.\nSpeed:\nRegarding speed there is a difference between the file systems. A file system such as APFS or HFS+ is usually slightly slower than FAT32 for example as they have to do extra work in terms of saving logs, checksums, etc. However in practical use, the average user wouldn't be able to tell them apart in terms of speed on a modern SD-card.\nModern SD-cards can actually provide data at very high speeds. Today you can easily buy SDXC cards of the UHS-II variety, which have data transfer rates in the range of 300 MB/s (the faster ones cost about 100$ or more depending on capacity - for example cards from Angelbird).\nNewer specifications for SD card interfaces have also been released in the even faster UHS-III and even SD Express variety. This could theoretically mean data rates of up to 624 MB/s and 3938 MB/s respectively in the future.\nTake note that how you connect the SD card to your Mac can affect performance. Are you using an internal card reader on an older Mac, check which card types it supports. If you're using a USB-connected card reader, ensure that you have a USB 3.0 type in order to support the fastest SD-cards at their full speed. A USB 2.0 connected card reader usually tops off at about 40-50 MB/s, so if you have faster cards than that, you would want a USB 3.0 reader.\n\nA: \nIs there any advantage to formatting them in any other format?\n\nThere is no advantage of one over the other in terms of speed, reliability, or (as you put it) \"safety.\"\nAs far as speed goes, the fastest SD card isn't even close to USB 2.0 speeds so your USB port won't make any difference.\nAs to format, it's more for convenience; ExFAT allows the highest degree of transfer-ability between platforms.  JHFS+ gives you the best compatibility with macOS as NTFS will do the same with Windows.  It's all a personal preference.\nRecover-ability (of data) has more to do with whether or not the card can be physically read or not.  Data loss on SD cards is either due to the card failing or the device glitching causing data corruption.  If the card can be read, your chances of data recovery are good.  If the card failed, no software or file format would overcome a physical failure.\n\nSpecifically looking at safety as I've lost files on another microSD that is using exFAT.\n\nYou need to look at a different technology.  SD cards are notorious for failing, thus the dual slots in DSLR cameras (or the very regimented backup workflow).\nSD cards have their place and work wonders when used as designed.  However, if you're using this to augment storage in someway, you need to look at a different solution like an external USB 3 SSD drive or a Thunderbolt drive/array\n", "Q: Don't prompt for opening certain external apps in Chrome Chrome prompts me before opening external apps.

That should satisfy Continuity Markup system requirements.\nI can do Continuity Markup with Quick View, with Screenshot's Floating Thumbnail, but, surprisingly, not with Preview. The icon is simply not there to click.\nAny suggestions how to fix this?\nBoth devices were recently restarted.\n\n\n\nA: The Apple documentation about Continuity Markup is not as clear as it could be.  The only way to get Continuity Markup to work is follow the steps in this Apple Support page.\nYou just can't open a doc in Preview and get this to work.  The Continuity Annotate button you indicated will not be displayed on the toolbar unless you follow these steps.  It's not one of those buttons that are displayed all the time in Preview.\n\n*\n\n*Continuity Sketch and Continuity Markup work when your compatible devices are near each other and set up as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Your Mac and iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on.\n\n*Your Mac and iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch are signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID using two-factor authentication.\n\n*Your Mac is using macOS Catalina, and your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch is using iPadOS or iOS 13.\n\n\n\n*From the Finder on your Mac, find the PDF or image that you want to mark up.

Click the markup button  at the top of the window.\n\n*Or Control-click the document, then choose Quick Actions > Markup from the shortcut menu.\nFrom the markup toolbar at the top of the preview window, click the annotate button, in my case it was the iPad icon .\n\n\n\nWhen this is done, the document will open on the iPhone/iPad automatically and you can start making changes.  Changes made on one device will be shown in the other device, too.\nI followed the steps and was able to see my iPad icon in the toolbar and get this feature to work:\n\n\nA: I agree that \"Preview\" applications doesn't support Continuity Markup, for no reason. Continuity Markup only works on \"Quick Look\".\nSo pressing Space bar on the file (opens Quick Look) is ok. But double-click (opens Preview) not good for iPad annotations.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina hibernatemode 25 invalid? (MacBook Pro 13\" 2020 w/ macOS 10.15.5)\nI've always set hibernatemode to 25 for all my old Mac's (running OS 10.10.5) without a problem. However, setting hibernatemode to 25 on Catalina didn't seem to work, even when I turned off the Standby feature as suggested in this link: macOS Mojave hibernatemode 25 | Dark Wake/ sleep wake .\nWhenever I open the lid, I see the login screen immediately; apparently it did not wake from a hibernation state. I checked the \"Wake from\" Console history and it showed several \"Wake from Deep Idle\" events; none of them was \"Wake from Hibernate\".\nIs it possible to make Catalina hibernate?\n\nA: Old post but still relevant as some people use old Macs even today.\nI can confirm that on my MacBook Pro mid-2012 (non-Retina) a real hibernate mode no longer works in Catalina. After opening the lid there is virtually no delay until the screen is visible; moreover, while in its sleep state, the LED does not turn off but keeps on pulsing.\nI currently have 3 systems on that same MacBook:\n\n*\n\n*El Capitán\nhibernatemode 25: real hibernation happens, LED turns off; when waking up, the machine sound can be heard and the progress bar appears\n\n\n*Mojave\nhibernatemode 25: LED turning off; when waking up, machine sound; no progress bar, though\n\n\n*Catalina\nhibernatemode 25: screen gets dark, but LED keeps on pulsing; waking up: no machine sound, the screen is immediately visible\nAccording to some statement by an Apple technician (mentioned in a few forums) hibernatemode 25 is still in the macOS code but no longer gets applied. So this mode seems to be invalid, indeed.\nBy the way, I really tried everything (PRAM reset, SMC reset, all kinds of pmset settings, etc.), but nothing helped.\n", "Q: Finder does not recognize all sharepoints available, opens only 1 that was previously mouned by default Finder does not recognize all sharepoints available, opens only 1 that was previously mouned by default;\nruning macOS Catalina 10.15.5 acting as client connecting to AFP File Server running Mac OS Server Sierra 10.12.6)\nOn my server (Mac OS Server Sierra 10.12.6) my sharepoints look like this:\n\nI should have 4 available sharepoints (shared folders) to my user jfb on the system: FAMILY-ARCHIVE, jfb, PHOTOS-ARCHIVE, and VAULT (the other two you see in the picture are not accessible by my user jfb)\nHowever, when connecting to this server from a machine running macOS Catalina 10.15.5 (*intermitant), my client machine bypasses the sharepoint selection screen and goes directly to mount a single sharepoint that I previously have mounted\nThis happens even though I DO NOT have the username/password stored in teh keychain-- I just connected to this sharepoint earlier in this finder session with it.\n\nIf I disconnect the sharepoint (using the \"Eject\" next to the sharepoint in any finder window) and reconnect, the same thing happens.\n*Please note that this worked several times before and I have seen this symptom be intermittant.\n\nA: This is a disappointing answer for Apple, but if I restart my mac, the Finder apperas to reset and then prompt for my un/pw on the next connection attempt:\n\n\n\nA: I would suggest the following:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off all iCloud logins, iTunes account activity on every machine.\n\n\n*Confirm on the user login machine that the user account short name is correctly showing up as a user with the correct privileges in the server admin\n\n\n*Visit Utilities → Keychain and confirm your keys and intermediates and self root are 'trusted' (ie.

I want to reset my network setting because i am having a problom with visual voice-mail but i am afraid to do it becaue i do not want it to wipe my mvno.\nDoes it do anything like that?\n\nA: No - resetting network settings just causes your baseband radio to reach out. Unless you have jail broken, this is a very safe and in fact, good thing to do as it forces a proper hand shake and registration with the cellular carriers to the extent you can do that.\nAlso, it lets you call your carrier and let them know that your issues are not resovled after a reset and reconnection. They can trace your communications from the date/time you reset and then get the issue to their engineering team to help you promptly (we hope).\n", "Q: Reproducing execution launchd execution environment I have a script which runs flawlessly under a normal interactive shell, but which frequently has errors when run as a user LaunchAgent.\nIs there a way to manually, and ideally interactively, run a command exactly as it is run by launchd, to make it easier to debug?\n\nTo be clear, the script in question does work (intermittently) under launchd. It is not as simple as missing paths. I know that launchd uses a more spartan environment, but the situation is now:\n\n*\n\n*There are frequent intermittent failures under launchd\n\n*I have never reproduced these failures in my user shell\n\nAs is common, there are numerous differences in environment between my fully configured user shell and the minimal launchd context, so it is very difficult to guess what difference might be at fault (or whether it even is an environment variable that causes the difference), which is why I was hoping to find a way simply to run commands manually and interactively, exactly as they would run under launchd. I am surprised that there is not a launchd run subcommand or similar.\n\nA: Launchd jobs run with a default shell that does not import any of the typical environment variables you'll see in an interactive shell; in particular the PATH variable lacks any directories that your interactive shell might have added, which can cause headaches. You can work around that two ways:\n\n*\n\n*By making your script as thoroughly generic as possible: using full path specifications to every command and utility, and explicitly setting variables as you need them rather than relying on the environment.\n\n*By adding an EnvironmentVariables dictionary to your launchd plist file and specifying the environment there.\n\nThe second looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    < ... >\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n           <key>VARIABLE_NAME_1</key>\n           <string>variable_contents</string>\n           <key>VARIABLE_NAME_2</key>\n           <string>variable_contents</string>\n    </dict>\n    < ... >\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n", "Q: Create multiple files with different extensions with one command I am looking for a way to create multiple files with one command and automate the process.\nThey should share a common name but different extensions.

I need to undo more than 10 steps or even 20 steps backward but the software does not allow me. How can I achieve this goal?\n\nA: You can undo whatever you did since the last time you have opened the app. Further than that you will need to get a backup version of that \"library\" (meaning the file project in Apple's brain) located in your backups folder, defined in the Library Properties panel. Also it is a good idea to snapchat your \"projects\" (meaning the timeline/sequence) from time to time, so you have older versions.\n\n\n", "Q: Allow all applications to access Desktop, Documents, and Downloads in Catalina How do I disable the macOS Catalina security feature that prevents apps from accessing the Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders without my permission?\nThe ideal fix would be something that I can do once to allow all applications to access these folders without simply granting all applications full disk access.\nI have my Desktop and Documents folders stored locally, not in iCloud Drive.\n\nA: This functionality is referred to by Apple as “Transparency, Consent, and Control” (TCC), Access Control, and Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC). It is designed to give a user control over Apps to protect their privacy. In some cases an App will request access to something that App really doesn't need and the user can block the App from accessing that data or filesystem path. It is annoying, but it's typically a one-time event per App.  So unless you are frequently clean installing macOS it wouldn't be super annoying.\nApple provides a way to build a Configuration Profile payload to whitelist applications so the user approval prompts do not appear.  An Mobile Device Management (MDM) server would be the best way to deploy the payload.\nYou might be able to build a custom XML Plist Configuration Profile and manually load it on macOS Catalina without an MDM and it might work to whitelist the Apps you specify. But it's a lot of work and as of macOS 11 (10.16) Big Sur will break. Big Sur simply won't trust a Configuration Profile unless it comes from a trusted MDM.\nIf you want to try whitelisting the Apps and manually installing a custom profile you can review that sample here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/privacy-preferences-policy-control-custom-mdm9ddb7e0b5/1/web/1 You can use Apple Configurator to create the Configuration profile with this payload and double-clicking the .mobileconfig should install the profile.  There's a command line profiles command as well.\nThose who use MDM typically deploy a bunch of Apps and configurations and they whitelist kernel extensions and PPPC/TCC entries via Configuration Profiles. They can lockdown a great many things on macOS/iPadOS/iOS. Admins would whitelist Apps so the users are not flooded with a bunch of user approval prompts but also seeing fewer of them will help a user be surprised when they see one and hopefully make an appropriate choice or at least call the Help Desk.  You don't want users clicking through frequent prompts without thinking about the question being asked. Most Macs managed by an MDM wouldn't even grant administrator rights to the users and they would provide a company specific App Store where pre-packaged and prepared Apps are provided.  Those Apps would all be whitelisted on PPPC/TCC approvals.  The Mac App Store may be blocked to the user.  Those Apps can be deployed by the MDM via VPP (Volume Purchase Pricing) integration with the companies procurement department.\nSo unless you setup your own MDM server and manually create a Configuration Profile to whitelist all the Apps and update that list over time. Then deploy it. There isn't really a good answer here. It's still a lot of work to manually specify every app in an XML file and only really useful if you are doing it across many Macs.\nThere is a Python tccutil.py utility on Github that can whitelist individual apps to the tcc.db but access to the tcc.db is blocked by SIP (System Integrity Protection) since Sierra. TCC was updated since Mojave to add the user approval to Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc. This tool won't work unless you disable SIP. Disabling SIP is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Since Catalina, the System volume is Read Only.  So you would have to not only disable SIP but also get around the Read Only System APFS volume which is possible.  Again, NOT RECOMMENDED. It is a lot of work that is frankly, not worth the effort to get around a one time prompt per App.\nThere is a published exploit where a malicious App could impersonate a trusted App identifier and signatures to bypass the PPPC/TCC protections.\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTION:\nThe X11 based apps such as Fontforge, Gimp, Inkscape, etc. do not run as true macOS applications.  They run a wrapper around a command line binary then load the X11 resources into the wrapper.  Therefore you must grant permissions to the Terminal App where these applications actually run.\nTry going to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access -> Unlock the panel and click + and add the Terminal App. This is fairly dangerous and has security implications but according to the Github issues regarding Gimp, Fontforge, etc. This may resolve the problem as a work around.  It is unlikely these applications will fully resolve this issue. They have made some recent changes to help alleviate the problem on macOS.\n\nA: Some commenters have been asking how to use their X11 applications on Catalina, so I thought I'd follow up with some research I did on this issue recently when I was having trouble using FontForge.\nWhile the original answerer is correct in that there is not a way to do this for all apps, there is a workaround for some apps that are more likely to have problems prompting for access to these folders, though there are security problems associated with it.\nRecent versions of GIMP and Inkscape have fixed this issue, so other people having the same issue as me should try updating their applications. FontForge, however, has not updated to fix this problem and seems unlikely to do so. The \"break glass in case of emergency\" solution in this case is to add \"/bin/sh\" to the Full Disk Access section of System Preferences. Obviously this is NOT SECURE. DO NOT DO THIS unless you have a backup. If you do have a backup, however, this will almost definitely fix your folder access problems until FontForge gets around to updating their software. If and only if you have done a recent backup of your files, please follow the instructions below.\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access.\n\n*Click +\n\n*Select your hard drive in the sidebar (named Macintosh HD unless you've changed it).\n\n*Use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘.

I don't usually dig around with the terminal, but I have been puzzled with the local host behavior on my Mac for a long time.  It works in some conditions and doesn't in others.  My question isn't about the localhost, but about scutil.\nI tried this out scutil but it seems like a blackbox to me.  It sets and gets the data I ask it to, but where does it store the information?  What does scutil mean?\n\nA: scutil talks to the System Configuration daemon, configd. Some of the info it deals with isn't stored anywhere (except in RAM), because it relates to the live state of the computer. The part that does get stored is (at least mostly) in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ directory, especially the preferences.plist and NetworkInterfaces.plist files. man scutil and man configd both have relevant (if superficial) info.\nThe format of the information in the configuration database is rather cryptic, both when viewed directly in the files and via scutil. For most network configuration tasks, networksetup is much easier to work with. I don't really recommend using scutil except for its --set and --get options (which set and get the Mac's various network names).

The three digit semantic versioning format is described in Apple's developer documentation and is widely understood beyond Apple's platforms:\n\nGiven a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:\n\n*\n\n*MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,\n\n*MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and\n\n*PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.\n\nAdditional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.\n\n\nA: You do not need to update the version number to version 3.5.\nYou can simply add the new build of 3.4 like any other update. Just ensure that the build number is higher than the previous builds of 3.4 you've added.\nI.e. if you're currently selling version 3.4 build 2, then add the fix as 3.4 build 3.\nYou could also consider changing the version number to 3.4.1 or similar, but it is usually not a requirement.\n", "Q: Why can carriers limit unlocked iPhone hotspot/tethering? The answers here and here explain that carriers can tell an iPhone whether to allow tethering or use as a hotspot.\nMy question is why, on an unlocked phone, can they do that?\nHas Apple simply colluded with a cellular service consortium to respect their wishes?\nOr are there a means by which a cellular data provider can detect that data are being served to and from a different device through the iPhone bearing its SIM card?  (While possible without any countermeasures, AFAIK it would be trivial for the iPhone to obscure the fact that it is tethering.)\n\nA: The main reason for this is that Apple works together with cell providers. Both have an interest in having the right products available for their customers.\nIt is of course trivial to say that the iPhone knows that it is tethering, as this is part of the functionality implemented on the iPhone. However, as you state: the main reason that providers know that you're tethering is simply that the phone tells them this. Often this is done by having ordinary data traffic to/from the phone pass via one APN, and tethered traffic pass via a different APN.\nThis allows cell providers to offer different service levels, transfer maximums, pricing, QoS, etc. on the two types of date.\nHowever, it is not so that any tethering is not detectable without the iPhone explicitly telling the provider that tethering occurs. Cell providers have ways of detecting tethering that works in different ways – some more foolproof than others.\nFor example data packets on an IP network have a TTL value in their headers. Whenever the packet is routed from one network to another (for example from a laptop to a home router to a USB connection to your phone and to the cell providers network) then the TTL value is decreased by one at each \"hop\". This is done to ensure that no packet can stay in the network indefinitely (i.e. due to loops, circular routing, or other problems) so when the TTL value reaches 0 it is discarded. A cell provider can use changes in this number as an indication of tethering happening.\nHistorically, tethering has been one of the reason why some have jailbroken their phones. Several types of add-ons exist that are intended for users to get tethering working (or bypass limits) where it previously wasn't possible. In some cases this could be breaking their agreements with their cell providers, in others not. This has been discussed for example here:\nhttps://yalujailbreak.net/hotspot-tethering-app-iphone/\nAdditionally, some have created apps that allow for the same functionality without jailbreaks. For example take a look at this open source project:\nhttps://github.com/rickyzhang82/tethering\nEssentially they work by implementing a proxy server in an app on the phone. This allows other computers to connect to the proxy for data transfers (such as web browsing, downloading files, or whatever it might be) while the data transfers appear to have taken place on the phone itself.\n\nA: \nare there a means by which a cellular data provider can detect that data are being served to and from a different device through the iPhone bearing its SIM card?\n\nA SIM card has nothing to do with this - a SIM just identifies the account with the device for authentication to the network.   And, yes, the phone can detect whether it is being used as an end device or as a bridge/router between two networks.\n\nAFAIK it would be trivial for the iPhone to obscure the fact that it is tethering.)\n\nWhat makes you think that?  Tethering via USB requires the phone to be put into a mode to basically make it into a USB to WiFi adapter.  To be a hotspot, it has to reconfigure itself to, at a minimum, implement NAT and a rudimentary firewall.  The OS must be part of this so both the carrier and iOS are going to be aware.\n\nHas Apple simply colluded with a cellular service consortium to respect their wishes?\n\nYes.  It’s their (AT&T, Verizon, Rogers, Vodaphone, O2, et al) network, it’s their rules.  If you read your contract, an unlimited plan isn’t so unlimited as they will throttle bandwidth after a certain data cap has been reached.  They also specify how many devices can be tethered or be on a hot spot at once.  So, yes, Apple and carriers work together to ensure their contracts are enforced.\nWhy do they do this?\nTo sell you other products.  They make different products for different needs/markets and they are fully within their rights to protect those markets - especially when you agree to the contract terms and sign the service contract.\n", "Q: Which MacBook Air models use an SSD compatible with my mid-2013 11\" A1465? I got a damaged MacBook Air for free a few years ago with the screen not working and the SSD missing. I got it fixed and working with a USB3 external drive and it's been great for years.\nNow I'm shopping for a secondhand internal SSD replacement. I know these machines used proprietary SSDs and they varied a lot from model to model.\nMost people that sell these privately just list what model the part is from.

I used to have a 'Find my' map on the details popup in Messages, useful for quick access to that info.\nIt disappeared around the time I upgraded to Catalina, so I assumed the feature was pulled. However, when I got a new MBP 2 weeks ago, the feature reappeared, so there as probably something wrong with my old installation. It has now disappeared again, so why is that and how do I get it back?\n\nA: The easy way to get a known good system and all Apple apps is to boot to recovery and reinstall the OS.

I had tried upgrading my MacBook Pro to Catalina from Mojave a couple of times on my own, but always got stuck on a 'could not be verified' error at the very end of downloading the said upgrade. Finally I decided to get it done at a verified Apple Service Centre. I have backups of my important documents on iCloud as well as a Time Machine backup for everything on an external hard disk.\nI had submitted my MacBook Pro to the Service Centre yesterday and got it back today. The upgrade to Catalina is perfect, but I've lost all my data and applications. Even the user profile that I was using is nowhere to be found.\nNow iCloud is automatically restoring some of the documents that I had backed up, but the applications/software that I had installed are completely lost. I do have a Time Machine backup, but I am not sure how I restore to that one. Moreover, restoring would take me back to OS Mojave, I think.\nIs there any way I can keep Catalina but get back my applications/software from Time Machine?\n\nA: The Migration Assistant is the program on any Mac that allows you to transfer in or out data and applications. I would connect your backup drive and then start the assistant.\nIt will then show you the information from the most recent backup or if there are many backups and the system can’t tell which backup was on your Mac, you can choose from the many destinations that can be saved to one Time Machine drive.\nYou can bring in accounts, settings, applications or a mix of some or all of the above.\nHere is Apple’s support article that I think does a good job of the overall design and intent of this process.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350\nSince Catalina has excellent support for containers, the old steps to reinvoke the assistant are a bit complicated. If you don’t have anything on your new system, erasing the content / reinstalling in an erase install might be much easier now that you are on Catalina.\n", "Q: iOS notes app - drawing tools disappear when using Pencil I noticed the following behaviour and consider it a bug.

The Macbook cannot run only on the battery - it requires the AC power adapter to be plugged in to power the device.\nThe battery used to provide 11.1 volts but there may be fault in cells or BMS circuit which is causing it to output only 7.3 volts.\n\nThe battery gets charged normally but I don’t know if any power is consumed from the battery by the MacBook.\nIt’s similar to using Macbook without battery, but Macbook cpu speeds are down when only used with AC adapter. But I notice no cpu throttle when used with 7.3v battery and AC adapter.\nI have also observed Frequent short freeze while working with apps.\nIs it safe to use the Macbook with combination of defective battery (7.3v)and AC adapter?\n\nA: If the apps are freezing then the Mac is trying to use the battery for power and failing.\nMost (if not all) portable Macs use both AC and battery for short periods (like opening apps). A bad battery can cause crashes and data loss as the Mac tries to use the battery and cannot.\nThe CPU throttles without the battery because the Mac sees the missing battery and lowers power use. Your Mac has freezes because you exceed the AC adapter slightly. I assume a larger power demand will cause a crash.\nAt the very least the battery can swell and bend the Mac, and can sometimes catch fire if the defective cell cannot turn off. It would be safer to remove the battery and use on AC.\nWith only 3 cycles the battery looks like it was constantly full for 8 years (non-retina device) so it is time for a fresh battery.

I also want to set different icons to different input system on Japanese.\nIs this possible on macOS?\n(I use Big Sur Beta 2 but a solution on Catalina is totally fine.)\n\nA: The only way to do this as far as I know is to create custom keyboards with a app like Ukelele, where you can create any icon you want for a layout.  But Ukelele cannot make custom keyboards for complex \"input methods\" like Chinese and Japanese.\n", "Q: How to Quit by default X11 when shutting down When I shutdown my computer I am having followin pop-up for X11, by default I want to always Quit instead of manually clicking.\n\n[Q] How to accept by defualt Quit for X11 when it is closed?\n\nA: Adding the following to the X11 preferences removes the popup-\ndefaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 no_quit_alert true\n\n", "Q: Cannot resize APFS container after updating to Big Sur I've installed Big Sur beta 2 and tried to use Boot Camp Assistant but I got the error \"disk could not be partitioned\".

Do it at your own risk, I don't know whether it will work on your Mac.\n\nA: sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0 0\n\nYou could vary the statement if you have a specific size in mind but you also just set it to 0 and it will grow to maximum physical disk size.\nYou can do this after copying the Time Machine image to a new disk for example.\n", "Q: Whither macOS Server 5.3.6 installer? Until a week ago, I was happily running macOS Server 5.3.6 on High Sierra.\nMy hard drive failed, resulting in an eternal beachball instead of restarting.  So, I put a clean copy of High Sierra 10.13.6 on an external and rebooted from the new/external startup disk.\nProblem:  Neither Server.app, nor the /Library/Server/ directory are present on the clean install.\nI need to install Server 5.3.6, the last Server version with support for websites and IMAP mail.\n48 hours later I am still searching.\nWhere can I find a copy of the Server 5.3.6 installer?\nOr, should I simply erase the drive and install macOS Sierra [or a given prior macOS version]?\n\nA: Server is a separate app from the OS, that you download from the Mac App Store. It will be listed in the Purchases of the AppleID that was used to buy it.\nYou could also copy the app from your backup, and it will create all the necessary folders from scratch. (You may want to copy over the contents of /Library/Server, and other files, to restore your server settings.)\n\nA: You want 5.6.3 not 5.3.6. I'm running this version on my Mac mini with High Sierra and it has Mail and Websites support.\nIf you go to macOS Server.app on the App Store and try to download it from a computer running High Sierra, that is the version that you will get.\n", "Q: Moving files (manually in Finder, via terminal MV, or via script) appears to leave a 'ghost' file in search results that cannot be deleted Scenario:\n\n*\n\n*I use plex with a DVR and torrents to download tv shows and the accompanying files.\nThe DVR files save to DRIVE_1, and the permanent storage for PLEX is DRIVE_2.\n\nIssue:\n\n*\n\n*When the files are moved, it appears that many (some, not all) files are 'ghosted'. Essentially, the files that have been moved still 'appear' in the search results of smart folders, but they aren't real files. They cannot be edited, deleted, etc. I cannot seem to remove them from the search, even though they do not physically exist on the drive being searched.\n\nLayout:\n\n*\n\n*They are both physical drives.\n\n*DRIVE_1 is OSX Journaled, and DRIVE_2 is EX_FAT.\n\n*My script is an applescript 'app' that uses \"do shell script\" to run a series of BASH commands to mv the files that are relevant. They are also being renamed using \"A Better Finder Rename\" call out before the MV command.\n\n*I use MV, and not CP, because DRIVE_1 needs to be free for other files.\n\nProcess:\n\n*\n\n*Either manually using (Command down) Drag and Drop, OR via the MV command in terminal in the script, the system will find the *.mp4/mkv/etc file types, rename them, and then MV them to the TV_Shows directory.\nHere is an example:\ndo shell script \"find /Volumes/DVD_Scratch/Downloads -iname '*.mp4' -exec open -a /Users/MYName/Documents/xHelper_Apps/DVDNameFix.app {} +;\"\ndo shell script \"find /Volumes/DVD_Scratch/Downloads -iname '*.mp4' -size +90M    -exec mv -v '{}' /Volumes/DVD_Music/TV_Shows/_Unsorted_TV/ \\;\"\nAs you can see, this basically finds all mp4s, sends them to the Renamer App, then 'qualifies' if they are over 90mb, and MVs those to a folder.\nI think this is where the issue comes in. Some of those files, after the MV, the filenames in the original location are still showing as 'ghosts' in the system.\nI can't explain it any other way, because:\n\n*\n\n*They DO show up in a Smart Folder/Search\n\n*They do NOT show up in Terminal\n\n*They do NOT show up with a file path.\n\nSee in the image below. in the smart search, I am simply looking at 2 things: Location=DRIVE_1, and KIND=Movie.\nYou will note that \"The Munsters\" and \"Smallville\" are selected. The Munsters is a 'ghost' file, in that:\n\n*\n\n*It has no file location (no \"where\" in the info)\n\n*It has no Edit or Read Access\n\n*I cannot drag it to the trash\n\n*I cannot CMD-Delete it\n\n*I cannot drag it to the terminal (it does nothing)\n\nWhat I've Tried:\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild Spotlight\n\n*Reindex via terminal (sudo mdutil -i on /)\n\n*sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100 AND sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V200\n\n*Repairing Permissions from Disk Utility\n\n*Running Daily/Weekly/Monthly from Terminal\n\n*Running diskutil repairvolume /Volumes/MYVolume/\n\n*Recreated the search.folder\n\n*Deleted /Library/Caches for Finder\n\n*Deleted /FinderPreferences\n\nWhat does work:\nI know that if I reformat completely, this does go away; but that is not a regular solution; at least, it shouldn't be.\nLooking for ideas on next steps, or at least the cause.\n\n\nA: So, the solution is that the EXTERNAL drives, for whatever reason, were not re-indexing Spotlight.\nI ran this command directly pointed to the DRIVE itself, and this cleared the results.\nsudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/DRIVE_1\nSo, the takeaway is: Spotlight re-indexing (sudo mdutil -i on /) is only for the main HDD. Which, is weird, but that's what did it.\n", "Q: How to sync videos between a PC and an iPad? I have edited a video on my computer and I want to upload it to my Ipad. The problem is that the video does not end up on my photos/videos library, hence I cannot reuse it in an ipad application or upload it e.g. on youtube. I can transfer it through the file sharing option of iTunes to iMovie and other apps, but it is still useless as the filesharing enabled apps are limited. Is there any \"native\" way to upload a video and access it from any iPad application?\nPS: My desktop is windows, but I wonder how this can be done through itunes.\n\nA: Use iCloud Drive for windows on the PC and sign in with the same account on iPad. Then save the exported video to the iCloud Drive. It will sync on all devices that have iCloud Drive enabled.\nCross platform apps like OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox etc can help too.\nAlso install Files app  on iPad for easy navigation.\n", "Q: How to boost microphone input volume above 100%? My internal microphone broke, and I have an external microphone on my webcam on an external monitor that is extremely quiet even when the volume is set to 100%.\nI tried using Boom, Loopback, and SoundSource, all of them can amplify output (speaker) volumes to above 100% but not microphone volumes.\n\nIs there a way to boost the microphone's input volume above 100%?\n\nEdit:\nI'm using it for Zoom meetings, so I need a software that modifies the volume in real-time.\n\nA: I'm a bit late to the party, but I had exactly the same issue.  The answer was Audio Hijack (probably the one Rogue Amoeba product you didn't mention : )\nThere is a 'Built-In Effects' block called 'Volume' that allows you to alter the volume and it has 'Overdrive' options to increase the volume by up to four times.  Seems to work well for my Aftershokz OpenComm headset that's too quiet for me even at 100%.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: To increase the sound, import the sound file into an iMovie project. Once it is in, select the audio recording and drag the volume slider to anything beyond 100% (you can also click the sound button in the app and increase it from there).\nOnce you're done modifying the volume, share the iMovie project as an audio file.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 16\" fried all USB-C ports after using a Samsung 43\" monitor I'm trying to understand what happened to my MBP because it's a rather weird situation.\nI hooked my MBP to a Samsung CJ89 43\" monitor directly through USB type C. It worked for a while and then suddenly the built-in screen started flashing and then the connection to the monitor was lost. While connected, the laptop's fans were running hot but I didn't give it a thought, it usually gets hot even without it connected to a monitor since I run a lot of demanding tasks on it.\nAfter this, I realised that the MBP won't charge anymore on any port. The right side ports wouldn't do anything, while the left side ports would still charge my phone, for example.\nI used the original USB-C cable from Samsung, not anything cheap, so why did this happen?\nI'm mainly asking because I got the laptop fixed but I'm afraid of hooking it back up to the monitor.\n\nA: Without putting hands on with the proper test and diagnostic equipment, there is absolutely no way to tell.\n\nI used the original USB-C cable from Samsung, not anything cheap, so why did this happen?\n\nUntil you test the cable, you have no idea whether or not it's at fault.  However, if you have any doubt as to the functionality and reliability of said cable, cut it in half (to prevent it from being used by others) and throw it away.  Replace it with another from a known good, reputable brand.\n\n*\n\n*This could have been a failure on your monitor's part - it just dumped way to much power into your Mac.\n\n\n*This could have been a failure on your Mac's part.\n\n*\n\n*USB controller that negotiates power/charging died in some way\n\n*The SMC (and related circuitry) could have had a component failure\n\n\n\n\nI'm mainly asking because I got the laptop fixed but I'm afraid of hooking it back up to the monitor.\n\nIf I had to guess, my money would be on the Mac failing and not your monitor.  However, you can get a rather inexpensive USB-C power meter to \"see\" what your laptop's drawing and what your monitor (or other power source) is delivering.  These run from $20 to $40USD online.\n\nIt's it \"pro grade?\"  No.  Those cost hundreds and would be way overkill for what you want.  But it's \"good enough.\"  We're not looking to measure microvolts or check for negotiation packets.  It will tell you, however, if something is majorly wrong so you can take preventative or corrective action.\n", "Q: macOS (Catalina 10.15.7) - Save dialog - no way to filter/search In macOS, the Save dialog window has a search box, seemingly to allow for users to search/filter the output in order to use an existing file/folder name as a template to then modify for the new file/folder, however when you enter anything into that search box, the output window shows nothing. Contrast this to the Open dialog, where the same search box behaves as it should, and filters the output window accordingly.\nThe behavior with the Save dialog is recreatable in any app, including the Apple-provided native apps.\nJust to clarify what exactly I do (on other OS'es without a problem), here's an example:\nLet's say I have an existing file named \"File blah blah blah 12341242.txt\" and I want a new file named similar but with different numbers in it. On Windows and Linux, there are no issues with clicking an existing file in a Save dialog to have it fill in the file name of the new file with the name of the existing file so you can then either save it as that name or modify it as needed.\nIn macOS, however, the only way to do this is to manually scroll through the output window to find the existing file. But, let's say there are thousands of files there and you don't remember exactly what the existing file's name is. You go to the search box to search for a word or number of the file that you DO remember, only to find that the search box doesn't work (effectively), so you're out of luck.\nIs there some way to remove this restriction or modify it to allow the search box to function as a way to filter the output in order to use the output as a template for new files/folders?\nEdit 1:\nHere are 2 screenshots to show what I mean.  These are from the Preview app, for the record, so you know it's a default app and not third-party.\nScreenshot 1 - Showing an existing file name in the Test folder:\n\nScreenshot 2 - Showing empty search results even though the existing filename matches the typed text:\n\nEdit 2: Here is a short screen recording of the problem in action, if it helps better than still images\nScreen Recording\n\nA: I think the crux is searching for a folder vs searching for a file.\nSearch in open and save works as well as Finder for me - just a different interface and limited space, less affordances are present, but as a long time user of search, perhaps I just have gotten used to the limitations and don’t even see clearly how it’s failing you.\nWhen I need more space to search, I open a second Finder window and use spotlight search (sidebar search, tag search, Smart Folders, complex searches) to my hearts content and then drag the file I find into the save box.\nIt really helps you can drag and drop folders and files and they instantly update the file open and file save dialogs.\nAny time this doesn’t work, I find one of two things.\n\n*\n\n*The app isn’t using a standard dialog. You need to patch that app or select a new app so things are easy again\n\n*Spotlight itself is failing - this is easier to detect in Finder for me, but you can also detect this in app file dialogs if you are keen and know the results should show and do not.\n\nThe key win for me is having second display and drag/drop of files from outside the save box. You also might love a tool like DefaultFolderX - I used it heavily years ago but have gotten used to working with the OS and not needing extensions.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\nThe author is a long time supporter of Apple users and has superb value / customer support in my experience. The tool does amazing things - I just work on so many macs, that in stalling a bunch of tools doesn’t work for me unless I can’t live without that tool. Don’t take my not using it to mean it’s not awesome - it is absolutely amazing and well worth a trial.\n", "Q: Late 2013 RMBP switches to SCO(very poor quality) codec when using earbuds microphone It switches back to AAC once I pick the internal microphone as an input.\nDoes this mean that the bluetooth version is too old to handle both audio input and output with the earbuds? If so, can a bluetooth 5.0 replacement for the network card be purchased somewhere?\nBased on the system report, my current bluetooth is 4.0 (0x6).\nThe earbuds are Samsung Galaxy Buds+\nThey work nicely on my iPhone X.\n\nA: None of this will work.\n\n*\n\n*The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ require Bluetooth 5.0\n\n*The 2013 MacBook Pro's AirPort adapter Bluetooth is 4.0 and was a nice, industry standard PCIe slot so you could swap it out for another\n\n*The next Mac with Bluetooth 5.0 is the 2018.  Unfortunately, it doesn't use the old \"tried and true\" Broadcom chipset - it uses a proprietary Apple/USI (Universal Scientific Industrial) Bluetooth module.  So, the question becomes, even if you could source a BT 5.0 module from a different vendor - where are you getting the drivers?\n\nWhat bugs be about Apple is this need to be so rediciliously proprietary that upgrade-ablity concept has been literally thrown out the window.  Like you asked...\n\nIf so, can a Bluetooth 5.0 replacement for the network card be purchased somewhere?\n\nThe answer should be yes.  You should be able to get a PCIe WiFi/BT card from a different manufacturer like Dell or HP (or even Apple themselves) and upgrade it for additional features.  However, Apple immediately puts a stop to that by tweaking the AirPort card's firmware so that only its drivers will work.\nIf the 2018 MacBook Pro had continued to use the PCIe slots instead of soldering to the board, you could have theoretically swapped out the AirPort cards from one to the next and still have all the native Apple drivers.  Unfortunately, you can't.\nYour solutions are limited:\n\n*\n\n*Get BT 4.0 headset/earbuds specifically for you Mac\n\n*Upgrade your Mac\n\n*Try an external BT dongle (not recommended)\n\nApple has traditionally not played nicely with more than one BT dongle attached so I would avoid.  You can try - it won't break anything (physically) but macOS probably won't appreciate having two BT devices and you could break some functionality.\n", "Q: Add free space in Disk Utility \nI want to take the free space of 200 GB and add it equally to the MacOS partition and the Windows-Bootcamp Partition that is currently 34.3 GB.\nCan someone please help me through this process? Thanks.\n\nA: Honestly... that's messed up to the point where you should just start from scratch.\nApple is part way through a several year process to transition from HFS+ to APFS (and other related technologies like Core Storage), which has added a whole bunch of complexity to the low level filesystem layer of the operating system. Some things have been removed from the GUI and can only be done by command line for now, and if I'm honest, you just can't trust either the GUI or the command line to do anything without data loss.\nI assume you already have a backup? Make a separate backup from your main backup, erase the hard drive, and start over. Use APFS and if you don't need boot camp, get rid of it (I prefer virtual machines personally). It's time to format the entire disk, remove all partitions, and do a clean install - restoring from your backup.\nGet rid of the \"data\" partition for your home directory. It's not the best practice anymore especially on APFS. Some new features that work better if you give it the whole disk. And the last thing you want during a multi-year filesystem transition is to do anything \"out of the ordinary\".\nIf you can, I would hold off on this until the current beta release of macOS is available as a stable build (in a few months maybe?). That includes yet another new approach to splitting the disk into \"containers\" (which are similar to partitions). I haven't verified this personally, but I've heard it's something like one for recovery, one for the core operating system, another for user data (including stuff outside the home folder). Of course, how it works on the beta might not be how it works on the stable release.\nIf you really don't want to use a virtual machine for windows, I strongly encourage buying a Mac with two physical SSD drives and run Windows on the second. Or if you're on a laptop, get a good external SSD for bootcamp (this is a bit tricky to setup, but it can be done).\n", "Q: Time Machine says \"There isn't enough space\" and says I need 50 petabytes available to back up a one terabyte drive Time Machine hasn't backed up for a week.

Time Machine correctly reports there is 4.81 TB.\nI have a 1 TB hard drive on my MBP running Catalina. If I click on the options for Time Machine it says: \"Estimated size of full backup: 100.51 GB.\"\nHowever, when I click on the red \"information\" \"i\" next to the Latest backup, it reports that it needs 50.21 PB (yes, PB) of space. What in the world? I already have things like ~/Dropbox excluded.\n\nA: The comments got me pointed in the right direction. In my case it seemed to be all the Python virtual environments I have.

I would like to be able to use or access the data, notes, files, sms, images, voice memos, contacts and so on.\nI don't need to worry about the data being set up on the new phone. I just want to make sure I can access and use the data before I let go of my iphone.\nI would also like some assurance that any third party program isn't uploading whatever they can get to their own servers to their own ends. Via paying for the software or auditable open source software.\nLastly I want to be as thorough as possible in not leaving anything out.\nAny suggestion of tools or knowledge about how the backup data is stored or could be exported that could lens insight into a solution is appreciated.\n\nA: A lot of phone apps store their data in a way that no other software can read. Your best option is often to use the app on your phone to somehow export the data - instead of working with backups.\nA lot of the Files app can be accessed via iCloud Drive or copied into dropbox/etc. Photos can be exported by connecting your phone to a computer and importing it like you would a DSLR camera. Contacts can be synced with various PC contact apps, and from there exported as vcard files.\nSome apps won't have good export options and it might be easier to just give up on that data.\nSome apps, especially music and video players, have DRM specifically designed to enforce contract license terms that do not allow exporting. In the case of Apple music, the contract terms and DRM differ depending wether you downloaded the song as a \"subscriber\" or \"purchased\" the song.\nPlease try searching for existing questions/answers for each individual app with data you'd like to archive, and if you can't find anything, ask a separate question for each one.\n", "Q: Issue: Safari on macOS won't open a new window via keyboard shortcut I can open a new window from the menu bar, but for some reason Safari insists on opening a new tab rather than a new window when using either the default keyboard shortcut or a custom shortcut.\nHas anyone run into this issue before?

Please let me know how to create certificate for the same and code sign my package.\nCan I do it without Xcode ?\n\nA: You can code sign your distribution manually using the codesign tool. Apple's Code Signing Guide includes a section on manually signing code:\n\nSigning Your Code Manually\n… In the unusual case that you sign your code manually, or to interrogate an app for details about its signature, you use the codesign command line tool directly. See the codesign man page for a complete enumeration of the options this tool takes.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the bundle being signed, the final command typically looks like:\ncodesign -s <identity> <absolute-bundle-path>\n\nidentity refers to the common name of the signing certificate. For distribution on computers you do not control, you will want to issue an Apple Developer ID using Apple's developer web site.\nNotarizing\nOnce your bundle is code signed, you should ask Apple services to notarize it, see Notarizing macOS Software Before Distribution. This will remove the first run message from Apple warning about possible malware.\nAs with code signing, a command line approach exists using altool, see Customizing the Notarization Workflow.\n\nA: You can only be an identified developer by paying Apple $99 per year.\n", "Q: Is there a \"global\" setting for Do Not Disturb on iOS devices?

Here's the harder part, I would like anyone to be able to use it. The (possible) good thing is that the code's script file that I want to execute will be in the .dmg (I don't officially know if that's a good thing or not).\nPlease be advised that I know little to none about code and this is my first time working with it.\nThe closest code I have found that \"might\" work is shown below:\n\nThe link for ^this^ code is shown below. It is on this website:\nUsing AppleScript to click radio buttons\nIf you need more detail or anything else, please ask me in the comments below! Help and advice are really appreciated! Thank you!\n\nA: The code snippet you borrowed doesn't relate to what you're trying to achieve, so you can safely throw that away.\nTry to avoid looking for solutions that involve simulating clicks or keypresses, as these sorts of scripts are really case-specific, liable to break easily and frequently, and prohibit any additional interaction between the user and the computer whilst it is running.\nA .dmg file (or disk image) is an item on the filesystem, which means it can be manipulated using AppleScript.  You don't even have to have the .dmg window open.  It sounds like you already know the name of the file you wish to be opened.\nLet's say that when you double-click your .dmg file to mount (open) it, the name of the disk that appears on your desktop (or in the sidebar of a Finder window) is \"my dmg\" (this may be different from the name of the .dmg file itself, but it may be the same).  Let's then say that there's a file called \"some file.txt\" contained within the disk image that you wish to open.  The path to this file will be located at: /Volumes/my dmg/some file.txt\nTherefore, your entire AppleScript that will open the file (as if the user had double-clicked on it) will be:\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\" to open the ¬\n        POSIX file \"/Volumes/my dmg/some file.txt\"\n\nor alternatively:\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\" to open ¬\n         file \"some file.txt\" of disk \"my dmg\"\n\nBoth of these scripts are essentially identical.\nHowever...\nA limitation of both the method I've outlined above, and of your original notion involving simulated clicks, is that you won't be able to dictate that the file being opened should appear on a different desktop/screen that isn't the one that is currently active.\nClicking on the file necessarily means that the active desktop/screen switches to the one on which the window containing the file is open.  You can perform a similar switch to in AppleScript, so that the desktop/screen on which the .dmg file is open becomes the active one:\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\"\n    open disk \"my dmg\"\nend tell\n\nThis would be incorporated into the previous code to produce a combined script that looks like this:\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\"\n    tell disk \"my dmg\"\n        open it\n        tell its container window\n            open file \"some file.txt\"\n        end tell\n    end tell \nend tell\n\n", "Q: I'm taking my 2010 iMac in for SSD installation. What is best way to secure my iMac? I have a mid-2010 iMac running High Sierra and I'm taking it to a local shop to get my fusion drive replaced with an SSD. I of course have sensitive info in the Notes App and elsewhere on my computer. What is the best way to ensure the security of my iMac? Is there any way of doing so without deleting everything?\n\nA: Everything is going to get deleted anyway. Replacing one of the drives in the Fusion pair will render both parts unusable and very difficult to recover data from.\nAssuming you've got a backup, which you will use to restore your data onto the new SSD, then you will lose nothing by erasing the Fusion devices.\nNormally, the best practice for securing sensitive data is to encrypt the volume, but there's no point in this instance, as it takes time and is quite stressful for an elderly mechanical drive.\n\nA: You could set up full-disk encryption via FileVault, which will keep your data in-place. You could also wipe the drives using secure erase. I don't know what your shop's procedure is for replacing drives, but I'd recommend making a backup, and if you have anything sensitive on that drive, it's probably in your best interest to encrypt it or wipe it.\n\nA: This depends on whether the shop will just replace the hardware (so you need to restore from backup afterwards to reinstall the system) or whether they also migrate your data directly.\n\n*\n\n*If they just replace the hardware, make sure you have a useable backup (or even two to be on the safe side). If your current disks are encrypted with FileVault2 your disks are unreadable without your password, so as long as you pass your password along you don't need to take additional steps. If your current disks aren't encrypted, either enable encryption (and wait for it to run through) or reformat (with the most secure option) from Recovery\n\n*If they replace the hardware and migrate your existing data they will have access to your data while doing so (they even will need your password in case the current drives are encrypted)\n\n", "Q: How do I resolve svn: The subversion command line tools are no longer provided by Xcode I have subversion and Unity installed via brew.\nI have code in Unity to run svn and it returns the error:\nsvn: The subversion command line tools are no longer provided by Xcode.\n\nBut if I run svn in Terminal, it works correctly.\nHow do I resolve this issue?\n\nA: Turns out that Unity wasn't receiving the correct path.

I own a 13\" mid-2012  MacBook Pro, and have been using it for over 7 years. I have replaced the HDD with a larger SSD, and upped the RAM to 8GB last year to improve its declining performance. However, I have done nothing to its original battery.\nMy battery over the years has underwent 2000+ cycles, and can only last at most 2-3 hrs from 100% to 0% currently (with no apps using significant energy). My 60W MagSafe 1 charger (L-shape) has had some parts of the outer cable torn (half of it covered in electrical tape). The cable has become more and more yellow, and the plugs are slightly bent out of shape, although it still works.\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*How many years do you think the battery/charger of a MacBook Pro can last (mines is 7 years as of now)?\n\n\n*Should I look for replacements? If so, what should I replace in order to increase my MacBook Pro’s battery life?\n\nA: \nIf so, what should I replace in order to increase my MacBook Pro’s battery life?\n\nEmphasis mine\nThe battery.  Period.\nI would replace the battery only if having 2-3 hours of usable charge is no longer convenient.  The question you have to ask yourself is whether or not the battery, in it's current state is still usable to you.  If it's not, change it.  If it is, try to get every charge cycle you can out of it (I'm a big proponent prolonging the life of products to minimize e-waste.)\nYou might find this post quite relevant:  Quality factors relevant for getting a replacement battery (MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012))\n\nBattery Life\n\nMy battery over the years has underwent 2000+ cycles, and can only last at most 2-3 hrs from 100% to 0% currently\n\nYou are definitely several standard deviations from the norm on the right side bell curve that represents charge cycles and battery life.  Batteries generally have a useful life of 3 to 5 years. The \"1000 cycles\" is just a marketing estimate of how many types you can charge cycle the battery so you can estimate (budget) for battery replacement.  It's not a hard and fast rule (unfortunately, too many people believe it is).\nMagSafe Adapter\n\nMy 60W MagSafe 1 charger (L-shape) has had some parts of the outer cable torn (half of it covered in electrical tape). The cable has become more and more yellow, and the plugs are slightly bent out of shape, although it still works.\n\nIf your charger still works and is safe you have no reason to change it.  Yellowing of the plastic has nothing to do with performance - it has to do with UV exposure to the plastic.  If you're still making the connection with the adapter, there's no reason to change.\n\n\n\nNOTE: If it's brown, that means it's overheating and burning the plastic - destroy that charger immediately and get a new one.\n\n\n\nI emphasize safe because the ground wire in the MagSafe cables is also EM shielding.  If this wire is broken you should replace the adapter.   Here you have a couple of options.\n\n*\n\n*If replacing the adapter, I would get the 87W adapter.  It will give you more options if you choose to add another vintage Mac to your stable.  You can always use a \"larger\" charger than what your device is rated for; not smaller.  And with the MagSafe 2 Converter, you can use that MagSafe 1 with newer devices!  See Apple's Support Document Find the Right Power Adapter for Your Mac for full details.\n\n\n*If you have the technical skills, you can \"break\" open the MagSafe adapter and simply solder on a new cable.  Yes, you have to break it open because it's glued together (stupid design), but once open, you can solder on a new cable and (what I did) duct tape the adapter back together. I have one still working to this day.  iFixit.com has excellent guides on how to do this.\n\nA: How long should the battery last?\nA Mac battery should be able to do fine with general usage for 2.5 years (for my experience).\nShould you replace your battery?\nYes, 7 years is a very long time for a battery to work for.\nWhat should I replace?\nI would simply get a battery replacement done by Apple.\n\nA: I think your questions have been answered well, but I'll add this as what I feel is a good option to consider wrt your MagSafe power supply.\nYou can buy a MagSafe adapter cable that works with Apple's newer (USB C) chargers.\nI've been using this cable with an 87 W (and a 96 W) charger to power my late-2011 17\" MBP for several months now, and have no complaints - it has worked perfectly so far.\nLike others, I don't like to see eWaste wind up in the landfill. I considered repairing the original supply/charger, but my cable was also suffering a gross decomposition of the outer insulator. I much favor a modular configuration that allows separation of the charger from the charger cable, and so I took my old charger to the Apple store & left it with them.\nFinally, you may be interested to know that the deterioration of Apple's MagSafe charging cable is (was?) the subject of a class-action lawsuit. Despite this, Apple apparently continued to sell this defective product - at least through 2017.\n", "Q: Add exif creation time with correct timezone (TZD) to filename Hi i have a problem renaming a lot of photo and images files.

I'm very new to AppleScript so bear with me. What I am trying to achieve is for every time I run the script, the current value of a cell is copied into a cell, one column to the right of when I last ran the script, so the first time it puts the value of A1 into B1, then A1 into C1, then A1 into D1 ect. How would I do this?\n\nA: This is written as more of a proof of concept to show some logic in accomplishing the task. There may be a better way to code it, but I do not really do much AppleScript with Numbers, maybe someone else (CJK) can present some different code.\nThe following example AppleScript code was tested under macOS High Sierra and Numbers, version 5.1 (5683), with a default document using the basic blank template and as coded works per what was mentioned in the OP. The example AppleScript code assumes that Numbers is already running with the default document opened.\nAs coded, with set n to 1, if the value of, e.g., A1 is not missing value, then the value of the next cell in that  row whose value is missing value, then gets the value of the first cell of that row. In this case the value of, e.g., A1.\nSetting set n to 2, and so on, acts on that row and the value of that rows first cell, if not missing value, then get set to the value of the next cell of that row whose value is missing value.\nNote: The setting or changing the value of a cell is not set until focus is removed from that cell. This normally occurs when pressing a key, e.g., tab, enter, arrow or when clicking elsewhere in the document with the mouse. I'm mentioning this so when you go to test the code and you typed something in e.g. A1, its value is still missing value until focus is moved elsewhere.\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    set n to 1\n    tell row n of table 1 of sheet 1 of document 1\n        if the value of its first cell is not missing value then\n            set v to value of its first cell\n            set c to its cell count\n            set i to 2\n            set flag to true\n            repeat while flag is true and i is less than c + 1\n                if the value of cell n of column i is missing value then\n                    set its value of cell n of column i to v\n                    set flag to false\n                else\n                    set i to i + 1\n                end if\n            end repeat\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: quicktime resets playback speed after pausing Hi usually on players when you set a playback speed it doesn't reset after pausing the video but on quicktime this happens does anyone have a solution?? (I know that you can change playback speed using option key + clicking on fast forward button)\n\nA: Here is an AppleScript code that will make QuickTime Player remember the playback speed of a video after pausing it. Go to Script Editor and paste the following code into a new document, replacing # with the desired playback speed.\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    set theWindows to windows\n    set win1 to item 1 of theWindows\n    tell win1\n        set visible to false\n        set visible to true\n        set index to 1\n    end tell\n    tell document 1\n        repeat while miniaturized of win1 is false\n            if playing and rate is 1 then\n                set the rate to # as real\n            end if\n            delay 1.0E-3\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe playback speed (\"#\") can be any real decimal number (i.e., 1.5). Values larger than 1 will speed the video up, and values between 0 and 1 will slow the video down. A negative value will cause the video to play backwards.\nNote: The audio will drop out at speeds less than/equal to -2 or greater than/equal to 2.\nPress Command+S (or File > Save) to save the script in a location where you can easily access it, and then open the script and run it (press the Play button at the top) whenever you need it. You can pause and play the video as many times as you want, and it will play at the selected speed each time, as long as you do not minimize the QuickTime Player window. You can resize and move the window, and also open other applications in the foreground, though. When you are done, click the Stop button (to left of Play button) and you can close the script.\nIt can be a little buggy at times, but this is the only method I have found to remedy this issue.\n", "Q: Big Sur beta on external disk vs internal disk? I've read this question: Remove macOS from a APFS container? and this question: APFS - Is it possible to install 2 macOS versions inside one APFS container?\nIt seems there is a little bit more mess to using (the admittedly very cool) APFS to install more than one OS.\nThe way the Apple support document mentions it, it seems so easy, and APFS is very modern and flexible.\nHowever, as you can see in the question linked above, it's more subtle. Removing the second OS can require lots of manual steps to clean up the recovery partition, etc.\nSo my questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Is this messiness still present in Big Sur/Catalina running side by side? Does using a separate container help this?\n\n\n*If installed on an external disk, does this issue still persist?\nIn summary, Apple's support of multiple OS side by side in separate partitions seems to forget about the contamination of VM, Preboot and Recovery partitions...\n\nA: In general, I would recommend installing it on an external SSD disk. First, you won't have to worry about possible disk issues with your regular MacBook. Second, it is easier to erase and manage with Disk Utility.\nJust as long as you know how to install correctly, I would go for that option.\nEdit: While setting up a separate APFS works well in many ways, such as dynamically adjusting the size, the slight risk is still present in case things go wrong.\n\nA: I think you're confusing several topics into one question\n\n*\n\n*In your title, you're positing Big Sur and Catalina being installed on an external versus an internal disk.  I don't see what the comparison/contrast would be of external and internal drives and why it would be an issue installing either operating system on either drive.  I suspect you mean to ask about Catalina being on an internal drive and Big Sur being on an external drive (or vice versa) and how that would work but your question doesn't even hint at that.\n\n\n*In the body of your question, you ask about the issues surrounding having multiple operating systems within the same APFS container; however, it doesn't support the supposition of the title - internal versus external drives.  The questions, however, are valid in their own right.\n\n\n*You also ask if issues that aren't technically bona fide issues are resolved in an OS that's still in developer beta stats.\nSo as to your questions:\n\nIs this messiness still present in Big Sur/Catalina running side by side? Does using a separate container help this?\n\nProbably. This is still two operating systems running side by side in a single container (if this is how you choose to configure it).  But, remember, this is a developer beta not a public beta meaning there are still very significant changes to come.  Unless you're planning on submitting feedback to Apple trying to solve this at this stage is an exercise in futility.\n\nIf installed on an external disk, does this issue still persist?\n\nYes.  If the issue exists on an internal disk, why wouldn't it continue to exist on an external one?  Again, were looking at this from the initial position of internal versus external disks.\nHowever, there is part of your question that could shed some light on what I assume you're asking:\n\nDoes using a separate container help this?\n\nThere's nothing that says you can't have multiple APFS containers on a single computer.  You could have two internal disks, or two external disks or an internal and an external both with their own APFS formatted containers, one with Catalina (internal) and the other with Big Sur (external).  In fact, if you wanted to test Big Sur, I would highly suggest you format and install Big Sur on an external drive and leave your internal drive alone.  Either installation with not interfere with the other's Recovery, System, Preboot, etc. partitions.\nHaving multiple OSes on the same drive is obviously doable as per the links you provided, but it introduces an extra level of complexity you likely don't want to deal with.  I'm all for users trying things out and testing, but not at the sake of risking data - especially if this is your \"production\" or \"work\" machine.  So, yes, having this in a separate container on a separate disk \"solves\" this.\nIdeally, you test on a computer you don't mind getting \"hosed up\" because you mis-configured drives, but I realize having multiple Macs is outside the budget for a lot of folks; I still encourage testing and experimentation but on a separate drive.  Spending $100USD on a quality external USB drive is a lot cheaper than trying to recover your data because you experimented on your internal drive you use everyday.  And, as always, make copious backups.\n", "Q: MBP built in keyboard unresponsive until complete shutdown MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), running macOS Catalina 10.15.5.\nSometimes while working, the built-in keyboard becomes completely unresponsive, the only button that works is the power button. Logging-off, sleeping etc. does nothing, only shut down and fresh boot (with the chime) removes the issue.\nWhile the issue is happening, the Caps Lock light is turned on.\nTouchpad works fine, and plugging external USB keyboard also works (but doesn't unlock the built-in keyboard).\nMouse Keys, all this stuff is turned off.\nI noticed, but have no proof, that this happens when I'm pressing various left-side modifier keys: shift, alt, ctrl, cmd, tab.\nIs this a hardware issue? A software issue? A hidden shortcut? Is there some kind of logging that can be turned on to watch for this kind of things?\n\nA: This is a hardware issue and more than likely you need to have the keyboard (top case) replaced.\nThe keyboard is on the USB bus; if you look for it in the device tree of the system report, you’ll find it there.  The fact that it stops working after a while says yo have a failing component - what exactly is impossible to know without putting hands on with proper diagnostic gear.\nWe know that it’s not your USB bus because you can plug in a different keyboard and it works - so the USB bus on your logic board is fully functional.\nHidden shortcut?  No.  With all of its complexity even modern computers are still pretty binary - it either works or it doesn’t.  There’s no setting to tell your keyboard to only work for a little while then stop, then start again after a reboot. Hardware functionality becomes intermittent when it’s in the process of failing (or failed).\nYou mentioned that the issue happens when your Caps Lock key is engaged.  If so, you may have narrowed down the issue however, the resolution is still, unfortunately the same - replace the keyboard.\nKeyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix\n", "Q: LG UltraFine & replacement Belkin USB-C cable gives blurry text I have an LG UltraFine 5K screen and a 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe original USB-C cable that came with the screen broke. So I bought a Belkin USB-C replacement. Now all text is noticeable blurry. So it’s not fully compatible despite the fact that I bought everything directly from Apple.\nAre there any settings I can try to tweak to get the same sharp text like with the original cable? I’ve already tried disabling font smoothing. If not, which cable I should buy to get full compatibility?\n\nA: Looking at the specs of the the LG 5K Display and the accessories (cable) it comes with, you can't just use any plain USB-3 cable.\n\nYou need a Thunderbolt 3 Active Cable.  Thunderbolt 1 and 2, natively, were active meaning power was required to operate properly.  Normally, Thunderbolt 3 is a passive, meaning power isn't present. Any quality USB-3 cable will carry Thunderbolt 3 (and vice versa).\nHowever, to drive this particular monitor, it appears LG requires an active cable.\n", "Q: Keep Zoom Screen Share Active I am using Zoom on my iPad and sharing my screen.\nAnytime the iPad screen blanks zoom stops sharing.

How do I prevent my AirPods Pro from launching my Mac's Music App (formerly iTunes) when I squeeze the stem to play?\nI wear my AirPods Pro pretty much all day and I'm constantly switching between my  my Mac and my iPhone. If I put the Mac to sleep, and then, forgetting that I'm still connected to my Mac, squeeze the stem to play something on my iPhone, the Music app will launch on my Mac.\nI understand what's happening here and I get why it's programmed that way… and I totally understand that it's my fault for forgetting that I'm connected to my Mac and not my iPhone… but it's still annoying. How do I disable this behavior?\n\nA: I don't believe there's currently a way to disable this.\n\nSqueezing the stem triggers \"play\" on the device it's connected to, and as of now there is no way to alter this behavior.\nTherefore the only solution is to disable \"play\" from opening Music on your Mac. Unfortunately, solutions to this no longer work with the current version of MacOS.\n\nA: I installed noTunes on MacOS 12.6.1 using the Homebrew method. noTunes adds an icon (that looks similar to the Music.app icon) to your top menu bar. Clicking on it toggles between allowing Music to launch when ending a call or removing your AirPods. When the icon looks like the Music icon with a circle with crossbar (i.e., the No symbol), then it prevents Music from launching when ending a call or removing your AirPods.\nIf you do not use Homebrew, the linked page also has a downloadable .zip file.\n", "Q: How do I log-out (or reset) Microsoft's RMS / AIP [Azure Information Protection] identity on a Mac for Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook? Microsoft 365 offers a RMS / Right Management Service called Azure Information Protection which is integrated with Outlook, Word, Excel. It encrypts documents of certain files, in a nutshell.\nOn a Windows computer switching between two accounts within Word is relatively easy, but switching the under-the-hood RMS/AIP account is harder. On Windows you launch the Azure Information Protection Unified Labeling Client and reset the logged-in account via that application (update :/).\nOn a Mac the integration in Office of AIP with Sensitivity Labels is similar to Windows; however, no AIP- unified (right-click) client exists at the moment of writing for Mac OS.\nMy question is: How do I log-out or reset the logged-in AIP user on a Mac?\nIt doesn't not matter what the logged-in account in Word is, that one is not necessarily linked to the account which logged is in AIP/RMS and fetches the appropriate Sensitivity labels and access rights.\n\nA: After a too long search:\nGo into the Mac's KeyChain and look for an Application Password called something like:\ncom.microsoft.office.rmscache\n\n(Search for RMS.)\n\n*\n\n*I deleted this record.\n\n*Quit Word.\n\n*Opened the protected file again.\n\n*Now I get the RMS/AIP login Window again and can user another account.\n\nFor the record, logging Word out normally or using Microsoft's remove-Office-license-from-Mac-pkg did not have the desired effect. Office's license account, Word's account (providing OneDrive etc.) and RMS/AIP's account are three separate entities.\nIn a simple world you have one account for all of them. In a more complicated set-up you can use the provided work-around to switch accounts.\n(Fyi, an alternative: create an extra MacOS user account.)\n\nBreadcrumbs I found:\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/17214.ad-rms-information-resetting-the-office-2011-for-mac-irm-client.aspx\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/030bba52-551b-4f31-8394-589b00418e22/azure-information-protection-on-mac\n", "Q: Editing a system preferences .plist file (not user preferences .plist file) I'm using an app that has .plist files in the user path ~/Library/Preferences/com.xyz.app.plist and the system path /Library/Preferences/com.xyz.app.plist\nFrom the command line I can edit the user .plist with defaults write com.xyz.app.plist key value\nBut how do I edit the system .plist file from the Command line?\nUsing \"sudo\" with the defaults command didn't work. In fact, it didn't seem to have any effect at all.\nEditing it in Xcode isn't preferable, but I can't do it there either. Using Xcode, I can bring up the system .plist file. But it's not letting me edit saying it's locked and not letting me unlock in Xcode.\nI've also chmod 666 the system .plist file from 644, with no effect on editing from the command line or Xcode. I've started Xcode under root, and it still had the same issue with the file being locked.\nHow do I edit this system .plist file (preferably from the command line)?\n\nA: defaults can also work on plist files specified on the command line, so you can use\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/om.xyz.app.plist key value\n\n\nA: I use BBEdit for modifying plist files in /Library/Preferences, which has the advantage of handling the authorization needed to obtain write permission, and then save the files with their original attributes.\n", "Q: App to lock the phone “right now” I configure my devices to only turn off the screen after a couple of minutes, and only lock themselves several minutes after (so I can quickly turn on the screen without needing to unlock them all the time), for example when outside walking for geocaching.\nOn Android, I have an application on my home screen which forces locking the phone (i.e. turns off the screen and makes it so that it requires the PIN when turned on again), which makes this scenario useful/secure. I would call this app when I want to turn off the device without needing to turn it on soon.\nWhich app do I need to install on iOS to achieve the same effect? (iPhone SE, iOS 13)\n\nA: [Apple] - Use Emergency SOS on your iPhone:\n\nPress and hold the side button and one of the Volume buttons until the Emergency SOS slider appears.\n\n\nThis locks the screen and requires a pin:\n\nIf you use the Emergency SOS shortcut, you need to enter your passcode to re-enable Touch ID, even if you don't complete a call to emergency services.\n\nIf that doesn't work (iPhone 7 and earlier):\n\nRapidly press the side (or top) button five times.\n\nNote that you may want to turn off \"Auto Call\", to avoid accidentally calling emergency services. This can be done in the \"Emergency SOS\" settings.\n\n\nA: You can use AssistiveTouch (Settings > General > Accessibility) where a tiny bubble floats on the screen. You can set it such that holding it locks the phone, or double-tapping it does it, or single tap > tapping the \"Lock Screen\" icon does it.\n\nThe menu gives you access to functions that would otherwise be controlled by pressing physical buttons or moving the device.

The only thing I like about Microsoft's implementation of the Common User Architecture is the Save As... feature, which makes it easy to use cloud storage, local backups, etc. I know, I know, you can always use \"Duplicate\" and \"Move\" the copy. That takes considerably longer than \"Save As...\". It's a real workflow-disrupter.\nIn recent version of macOS, this functionality has likely disappeared. Is there an easy way to get it back (or to add it to the menu again)?\n\nA: You can save the current document in Pages, Numbers and Keynote to a new location with Option Shift Command S. Holding down Option when the File menu is revealed will display Save As... in the place of Duplicate.\n\nA: With the File menu open, press and hold the Option key to get the Save As... command.\n\n\nUpdate: Some new users of macOS may be concerned about the discoverability of the command, as it is not visible by default in the Pages menu bar. And most users aren't aware that the Option modifier key can alter the behavior of commands.\nAn alternate discovery approach that new users can take to discover a command is to go to the Help menu and search for the desired command. A match, if available, would be highlighted, along with its keyboard shortcut, even if it is not directly available in the app menu. The same is illustrated below for Save As... command in Pages for macOS.\n\nThe trick works in any native macOS app.\n\nA: As others have said, you can get ‘Save As’ with the Option key.\nHowever, I prefer another way, which I have been promoting since Mountain Lion came out in 2012.\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences » Keyboard » Shortcuts » App Shortcuts.\n\n\n*Click the + button.\n\nThen enter ‘Save As…’ as the menu item and ⌘ ⇧ S as the keyboard shortcut:\n\nOnce you click ‘Add’ you will have the original keyboard shortcut for ‘Save As…’ back, since there is still no reason on earth why it should mean ‘Duplicate’.

I then rebooted to normal macOS and tried again to run Boot Camp Assistant, and I had the same problem.\nI then researched more about the problem, and I found a solution that seemed to work for many people. It said to reboot using Single-User mode (⌘+S), but my computer has the T2 Chip, so I then rebooted my computer with macOS Recovery (⌘+R) again, made sure the Macintosh HD volume was mounted, opened Terminal in macOS Recovery, and ran /sbin/fsck -fy. I got an error that said \"Error: Container /dev/rdisk1 is mounted\".\n\n\n*I then rebooted into regular macOS and ran sudo fsck_apfs -n -l /dev/rdisk1.

However, at the end, it showed that The volume /dev/rdisk1 appears to be OK.\n\n\n*To make sure the problem was because I wanted more storage than Boot Camp could allow, I tried setting the Windows size to 60GB, and it still gave me the error.\n\n\n*The Windows version I am trying to download is the Windows Education Version found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/vlacademicwindows10iso.

Credit goes to user tomadimitrie on the Mac Rumors forums who found the solution.\n\n*\n\n*First I booted into macOS recovery mode, and made sure that Macintosh HD was mounted in Disk Utility.\n\n*Then I opened Terminal from Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*Then I needed to find out the id of the Macintosh HD drive by using the command diskutil list, and finding the IDENTIFIER of the Volume called Macintosh HD. This ID may be different in recovery mode than the one in regular macOS, so make sure you run the command in the recovery mode terminal. The IDENTIFIER looks something like this: disk1s1.\n\n*Then run the command diskutil apfs listSnapshots <Macintosh HD's disk id> to list all the snapshots, all which start with com.apple.os.update-.\n\n*Then delete each Snapshot by using the command diskutil apfs deleteSnapshot <disk id> -uuid <snapshot uuid from the previous command>.

I installed the MySQLWorkbench app, but had to get it from outside the official App Store. I am using MacOS Catalina (10.15.5). So, I had to override the \"warning\" from Catalina, using the root password, that said to not install apps gotten from outside the app store. The MySQLWorkbench installed fine and works great.\nHowever, I noticed the metadata on the MySQLWorkbench executable file says it was \"*last modified\" on April 1st, 2020. And, today, the download / install date is July 11, 2020.\nSo, that's weird, right? I'm just assuming the workbench was built on April 1st. ok. But, I'd still expect the file metadata to say the last modified date, for me on my file system, is today. The day I downloaded and installed it, right? I've not installed from the app store in months, but the date metadata looks as I'd expect on the apps from the app store. The date I downloaded them is their \"last modified date\".\nI'm baffled. The April 1st date can't be correct, right?\nnote: I did have an earlier MySQLWorkbench that was not compatible with Catalina, and it had to be uninstalled (by dragging into the Trash) today, and replaced. But that trashed MySqlClient was installed 1 year ago, definitely not this April.\nAnyway, my database and workbench are all good. But, that date metadata on the workbench executable, and the fact I got it from outside the App Store have me confused.\n\nA: If you copy a file from one folder to another, that does not update the creation or modification dates. Nor does making a copy in the same folder. Try it!\nThe same is true for 'copying' a file from a remote location, such as a network drive or downloading from the internet.\nThe modification date is only changed if the contents of the file are modified.\nIt is arguably more useful to know that 'this is a copy of the file that was created on Tuesday, and modified on Wednesday', rather than 'this is a brand new file that was made on Thursday', just because you moved it or duplicated it.\nThis way, you know that the file's contents are the same as other copies in other locations.\n", "Q: What APIs is the `security` cli using? in particular the execute-with-privileges subcommand, which uses fingerprint scanning GUI to authenticate and i'm curious whether those could be used if I build a cli.\nDetails\nsecurity is a standard binary that ships with OSX and:\nsecurity(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              security(1)\n\nNAME\n     security -- Command line interface to keychains and Security framework\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     security [-hilqv] [-p prompt] [command] [command_options] [command_args]\n\nAny pointers or reference to documentation would help!\nThanks you!\n\nA: AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges\nsecurity uses the deprecated AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges function to implement execute-with-privileges:\nstatus = AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges(auth_ref,argv[0], 0, (argc > 1) ? &argv[1] : NULL, &communications_pipe);\n\nThe function needs an AuthorizationRef, which is the part that confirms who the user is.

I recently set up my iTerm and have been really enjoying how smooth and functional it is out of the box. I installed the Prezto zsh pre-config and set up Powerlevel10k as my Prezto theme. I also use solarized dark with Inconsolata for Powerline and Menlo for Powerline as my font, both of which have this issue.\nWhen I cd to my root director (cd /), I see an odd question mark box on my powerline. I also see the same box when I activate my virtualenv in a python code directory.\nBelow is a picture of this happening with the root directory. When I activate the virtualenv, the same thing happens but ON THE RIGHT SIDE beside an indicator with my project name that comes up when virtualenv is activated. What do the question marks mean? What is failing to display? I have no idea what is going on and would appreciate help in troubleshooting.\n\n\nA: After a period of troubleshooting, and with some nudges from Allan, I was able to figure out what was going on: my terminal was attempting to display a unicode lock.\nTurns out, my font, Inconsolata for Powerline, didn't support this. I came to this conclusion after reverting to my default theme in iTerm2 WITHOUT Inconsolata enabled. The lock displayed correctly there!\nAfter research, I found a Github repo (and its name is familiar... I feel like I used it on a previous install) of patched fonts that display most of the proper terminal unicode icons. Much thanks to ryanoasis on Github for this!\nIf you're having a similar problem like me, give it a try and see how it goes. Here's what the fixed terminal looks like:\n\n\nA: What your screenshot shows is Zsh prompt defined by Powerlevel10k. Powerlevel10k is flexible w.r.t. what symbols it uses to communicate information. As long as it knows the capabilities of your terminal and font, it'll stick to symbols that can be rendered correctly. On the screenshot Powerlevel10k displays a question mark because it thinks your terminal can display it. This usually happens when you configure Powerlevel10k in one terminal with one font, and then use the same config either in a different terminal or with a different font.\nWhenever you change your terminal or terminal font, you need to run p10k configure. If you aren't yet using the recommended font, the configuration wizard will ask whether you want to install it. For best experience, say \"Yes\", restart iTerm2 when prompted and then run p10k configure again. You may, however, refuse to install the font and proceed with prompt configuration. Powerlevel10k will still work but the choice of prompt styles will be limited if your current font isn't very capable.\n\nA: The question mark in a box is placeholder for a symbol from a font set it doesn't recognize.\nThere are probably pre-requisites and/or dependencies for Prezto and the Powerlevel10k themes (maybe even the solarized theme as well) that didn't get installed.  You can try reinstalling and watch for errors to see what does/doesn't get installed.\nAt minimum, we need to see your .zprofile and/or .zshrc files to see what modifications were made to your prompt and then possibly try to decipher which Unicode symbol the theme was going for.\nAnd not trying to be a negative Nelly here, I believe this needs to be said:  This is one of the issues I have with all these ZSH theme and customization packs.  Yes, they're cool and all, but most people have difficulty working in a shell to begin with.  Now, let's add a whole bunch of complex stuff to files the user isn't familiar with either and hope for the best.\nThe best piece of advice I can give is to try to understand your shell, as it is it it's native form before you start trying to make it look cool with scripts and customization found all over the Internet.  Why?  Do you really (no, I mean really) know what that customization is doing to your computer?  How can you be sure you didn't just install a backdoor to your machine?\n", "Q: HyperKit - Docker Desktop for Mac - Is it possible to launch traditional Debian VMs? Docker for Mac currently uses HyperKit (reference: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/)\n\nDocker Desktop uses HyperKit instead of Virtual Box. Hyperkit is a\nlightweight macOS virtualization solution built on top of\nHypervisor.framework in macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher.\n\nIs it possible to run a traditional Debian/Ubuntu VM using HyperKit on a macOS 10.15.5 or newer?\n\nA: Multipass\nIt is now possible to launch an Ubuntu instance on MacOS (with HyperKit). Use Canonical's Multipass.\n\nMultipass is a mini-cloud on your workstation using native hypervisors of all the supported plaforms (Windows, macOS and Linux)\n\nmultipass allows you to quickly startup an Ubuntu instance on MacOS much like Docker.\n\nA: Unlikely.\nI wrote an answer to a similar question that addressed the topic of using a a full blown hypervisor versus the framework that's built into macOS.\nThe framework fits Docker's model which was best described (can't remember who said it to me) as \"single function blocks\" and that model works perfectly with Apple's hypervisor's framework - a small, single function VM.\nTo get Debian going in a VM, your best bet would be to run it in a proper Hypervisor.\n", "Q: How do I run apple script on a particular instance of Firefox?

One day while using it I connected charger with it and as I connected charger it shut down.\nI tried to turn it on and tried SMC reset but it did not turn on.\nIt has been 3-4 months and I have still not able to turn it on. When I put macbook on charging I feel vibration on its body that we normally feel while charging so I think it is atleast charging and not complete dead. But it is not turning on.\nCan someone please help me understand what can be issue.\n\nA: There is no sensor to detect moisture that will shut down  a Mac.  There are moisture indicator strips that will let a technician know if it was exposed to liquid, howver.\nNow, if you got the MacBook wet, it can cause damage to the logic board where it will stop working.  Note that I didn’t use the term “shut down.”  This is because liquid damage can short out electrical contacts causing the machine to simply power off where you lose data unlike a shut down that cleanly turns off your computer.  It’s like pulling the plug on a desktop machine.\nIt may be too late, but you should still review this post:  What procedure should be followed post spilling fluids onto a MacBook keyboard?\nThe fact that it doesn’t turn on at all means you need to take it in for service.\n\nA: I have kept it in bag with 2 small silica gel for 4-5 months and I kept on checking every 15 days whether it is turning on and suddenly after 5 months one day when I connected to charger I got sound (chime when macbook is connected with charger). And when I pressed power button it turned on.\nI was happy to see my macbook working again after long time. And I am very happy I did not   visit apple store or third party store(due to lockdown) to get it repaired as it could have cost lot of money. (Because of my experience with apple store they always say your motherboard is damaged).\nI am not sure what was issue and why it started working again after few months.\n", "Q: Customizing Wallpaper for Apple Watch Infograph Watch Face?

I probably did something that I was not supposed to do and now I ran into some kind of problem.\nI deleted two old user accounts from my Mac inside System Preferences to get some space back. However the space did not become more so I checked the hard drive and found the two user folders still being there.\nSo I deleted both manually, which was probably not the best idea. They went to the Trash. However when trying to clear my Trash, the following error occurs:\n\nThe operation can't be completed because some items had to be skipped. For each item, choose File > Get Info, make sure \"Locked\" is deselected, and then check the Sharing & Permissions section. When you are sure the items are unlocked and not designated as Read Only or No Access, try again.\n\nNext I tried to delete the two folders via Terminal using this command:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/\nThis did not work either, I got the following error: Operation not permitted\nDoes anyone have any idea how to solve this problem. Thanks for your help in advance.\n\nA: Reboot to Recovery:\n\n*\n\n*Restart holding command ⌘ + R\n\n*Open terminal from utilities menu\n\n*Type csrutil disable then reboot\n\n*Empty trash\n\n*Reboot to recovery holding command ⌘ + R\n\n*Open terminal from utilities menu\n\n*Type csrutil enable then reboot\n\n*Problem may be fixed\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem. I have an iMac running Catalina 10.15.7 but I think my solution will work for any recent OSX version.\nBasically, I had an unwanted user folder inside my Users folder but this user didn't appear in the System Preferences > Users & Groups menu and so, it appeared that I couldn't delete it from there.\nIf that's the problem you face then, go to the Users & Groups menu, authenticate yourself (click on the padlock and enter your credentials), then click on the '+' to add a new user. Give this user exactly the same name as the unwanted user you want to delete.  The new user will be created in Users & Groups.  Now click on the '-' to remove that user. You will see a dialogue box asking you to choose from 4 options. The one you want is 'Remove the user's home folder from the computer'. Click OK and you'll find the unwanted user folder inside your Users folder is no longer there.\nYou can find more instructions on this here : Delete a user or group on Mac - Apple Support\nBut, unfortunately, I only discovered the above solution AFTER I'd made the mistake of dragging the unwanted user folder to the trash. Once the unwanted user is in the trash, there appears to be nothing you can do to remove it by any of the normal means - if you try to empty the trash, you get a system message advising that 'Voice Trigger' is in use and another that says 'Library' is in use.  I tried dragging it back to the Users folder and my desktop and it just created a copy and left the original in the trash; I tried the 'delete immediately' option; I changed the permissions on the folder to allow an Administrator to read & write (and hopefully delete - but that didn't work); I tried a number of Terminal commands; I tried installing an app called iTrash that forces deletion of 'stuck' items; I revealed the hidden files / folders in my own User folder (using cmd-shift-dot) and found the 'bin' folder with the unwanted user inside - I opened that and found the culprit 'voice trigger' folder. I tried setting the permissions on that to Admin read & write but even that didn't work; I tried booting into safe mode and seeing if I could delete from there but that didn't work either. Nothing seemed to work.\nThe solution\nSo, here's what I did. I have a bootable clone of my hard drive on an external drive as insurance (made with Carbon Copy Cloner). I plugged that drive in and set it as the startup disk (System preferences > Startup disk) and rebooted. Once the mac had booted off the external drive, you can see the internal MacintoshHD drive in the left panel of the finder window in the usual place. I opened the MacintoshHD and navigated to my own User folder and use cmd-shift-dot to display the hidden files and folders therein. I found the .Trash folder and inside it was the rogue unwanted user folder I had been trying to delete. Only this time, as I'd booted off of the external drive, the unwanted user folder wasn't in use by  anything so I was able to drag it to the trash (ie the trash can in the dock) - and was able to empty the trash in the normal way.\nI switched the start up drive back to the MacintoshHD and rebooted and voila - the rogue unwanted user folder had gone from the trash.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: Don't attempt to delete ~/.Trash! Delete the contents of it. If you don't have any dot files you can just rm -rf ~/.Trash/*. If you do you can rm -rf ~/.Trash/{.[^.],}*.\n\nA: Your Mac is in a state where other user access control prevents you from getting details from your trash.\nFollow this, especially the recovery portion.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201583\n", "Q: Files grayed out in Finder.

There are two popular methods to install Ubuntu on your Mac's external drive. The first one is to use default Ubuntu installer option where you use the entire drive. This method does not use rEFInd, unetbootin or the ubiquity -b option. Basically, you use the Mac Startup Manager, Etcher, and Grub. The second method is the one described in your link.\nIf you do not what to use the entire external drive for Ubuntu, then both methods will require you to partition the external drive. Ubuntu requires at least an EFI partition and a partition for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Make dns-sd exit after listing service Is there a way to make dns-sd just list a service and then exit? I am using\ndns-sd -L \"abcdef123@MySpeaker\" _raop._tcp. local.\n\nTo list an AirPlay device's details but it keeps running once that is done.\nContext: I have an AirPlay speaker that is slow to show up in the AirPlay speaker list on devices. The AppleTV shows up instantly so I was hoping to get some stats on when the speaker is slow to show up vs. not; as a way to understand what the issue might be.\n\nA: It’s designed to not exit. We have to track the process and send it an exit / kill signal. Apple even calls this out in the manual page. (and worse, doesn't supply bindings for dns-sd in swift or any other language that I can find so that part is an exercise left for the reader)\n\nFor example, calls like \"browse\" never\ncomplete; the action of performing a \"browse\" sets in motion machinery to\nnotify the client whenever instances of that service type appear or\ndisappear from the network. These notifications continue to be delivered\nindefinitely, for minutes, hours, or even days, as services come and go,\nuntil the client explicitly terminates the call.\n\nThe best I can do for scripting is use expect to fork the process with a timeout or just use something brute force like backgrounding the command so I can sleep and kill it and copy the results to the pasteboard.\ndns-sd -B _home-sharing &\nsleep 5 && kill %1\n\nIf you have another background process as %1, this will kill the wrong process.\nIn practice, I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a good browse or listen but not all networks are the same size.\n", "Q: What is the best way to validate every single file on an external drive? My mac is having a kernel panic every time I try to time machine this external drive.\nI've tried disk utility but I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually check for much, except maybe for some directory structure. The scan is maybe only a few minutes long and it reports everything has fine.\nIs there a command or app that will actually read every single file in the disk and report any corruption or IO error?\n\nA: According to Apple, if you run First Aid on a volume, Disk Utility verifies all the contents of that volume only. This is from this site. First thing I'd do if run first aid on your drive. It takes about 30 minutes to verify my drive.\n", "Q: to change the date based on exif data since export from Mac Photos shows date of export using exiftool I used the following to change the Date Created to the actual date the photo was taken because exporting from Photos showed the date of export.\n\"for file in *; do SetFile -d \"$(exiftool -p '$CreateDate' -d '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S' \"$file\")\" \"$file\"; done\"\nI got the following warning:\n\"Warning: [minor] Adjusted MakerNotes base by 46 - IMG_1369.JPG\" -- what does this mean?\nI found the above suggestion at this thread:\nExport from Mac Photos app while keeping date created data?\nAlso what is the cmd to change \"Date Modifed\" using exiftool?\nThanks.\n\nA: As a test, I exported six photos as JPG files from Photos, on macOS High Sierra, into a new folder.\nThen in Terminal I change directory to the new folder containing the exported photos and ran the following command to change both the create and modify date/time from the EXIF info:\nfor f in *; do SetFile -d \"$(exiftool -p '$CreateDate' -d '%m/%d/%Y %T' \"${f}\")\" -m \"$(exiftool -p '$ModifyDate' -d '%m/%d/%Y %T' \"${f}\")\" \"${f}\"; done\n\nThe prompt returned without error, and the exported files now have the original create and modify date/time.\n", "Q: Can InDesign CS6 and CC run well on Mojave 10.14.5? I'm using a MacBook Pro running Mojave 10.14.5 for work. My primary work app has been InDesign CS6, but a decision was made recently for everyone to switch over to InDesign CC.\nDoes anyone know if it's possible to run both the CS6 and CC versions of InDesign on Mojave 10.14.5? Is anyone doing this now? Anyone ever experienced any issues with either CS6 or CC?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can have both CC and CS6 installed at the same time. Creative Suite works well for me on Mojave, though there are some minor interface issues.\nAdobe's own website states that InDesign CC works on 10.13 and later. https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/indesign/system-requirements.html\nCS6 definitely won't work on Catalina, of course. However, I'm not sure why you should need two versions of InDesign. The later one is just an updated version, which can still open old .indd documents without problem.\n", "Q: Unable to fully maximize Terminal window I am trying to maximize my Terminal window so that it goes from edge to edge. I do not want to take it full-screen.\nHowever, I am observing that I am unable to do so and despite by best effort, there's a tiny gap that remains at the bottom of the window. The same can be seen in the screenshot below:\n\nI do not encounter this behvior with other macOS apps, just the Terminal app. Is this by design? or could this be a possible bug with the app?\n\nA: Terminal windows are always sized to show full text lines (you can check this by resizing the window manually to see that it resizes in steps), so for example if your text height in Terminal is 10pt and your screen height is 1275pt there will be a 5pt gap at the bottom (numbers not real and ignoring menu bar, window title etc, just to show the principle).\n\nA: Something that worked for me was opening Terminal settings (CMD+,), going to the 'Window' tab of the current profile, and setting the row count to the number of rows that resulted in the terminal window closing that gap.\nNote that this doesn't necessarily increase the amount of functional real estate in your terminal window. If there's a gap in the first place it's likely because the height of your screen and your font settings do not accomodate an integer number of rows. This will not change by changing the row count. Your terminal will still display the same number of rows. It's just that now that gap will be converted from a gap between your terminal window and the bottom of your desktop to a gap between the last row in your terminal and the bottom of your terminal window.\n\nA: As @nohillside said in his answer, the font settings has to match perfectly a line in order to have a real fullscreen.\nSo you can tweak Font size and Line Spacing in order to find a \"line perfect\" setup (tips: put a white window behind your terminal to easily set it up)\nI tried many fixed width fonts (SF Mono, Monaco, Menlo, PT Mono), and here a setup that worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*macOS: 10.15.7\n\n*Screen: 1920x1080 (16/9)\n\n*Tab Bar: Always shown (View > Show Tab Bar)\n\n*Font: Menlo Regular\n\n*Font Size: 14\n\n*Character Spacing: 1.046\n\n*Line Spacing: 1\n\nNote that Character Spacing does not impact the height, it is just more confortable to me.\nBecause my Macbook is 16/10 I still have a slight gap on it, but it is perfect on my external monitors.\nIf you have any other setup that works for you feel free to comment on this post\n", "Q: MacOS Big Sur cannot use wifi adapter device Recently, I upgrade to macOS Big Sur (11.0 Beta (20A4300b)).\nAfter upgrade, my tp-link usb wifi adapter(Archer T2U Plus model) no longer works.\nI had tried to reinstall the driver, and even other driver from gitHub.\nI also tried doing smc reset, nvram reset. Nevertheless, after restarting, my extended wifi adapter still can't work.\nThere is no issue regarding the wifi adapter itself. I am able to successfully connect adapter with my other laptop. Either type-c port directly or with a usb to type-c converter inbetween, both ports can recognize the adapter correctly. The adapter would start to blink after plug-in in 2 seconds, yet the adapter won't be able to blink at all for the Big Sur.\nWhat can I do to make Big Sur work with this wifi adapter?\nP.S. This is my working laptop, I had to bought this adapter after work from home period since its internal wifi is terrible. Even after the upgrade, the interal wifi still suffer network inconsistent issue heavly. Therefore I had to rely on the external wifi adapter to get decent network. While I upgraded the system, I didn't backup the system, so I can't time machine it back. And also wipe out the system would not be a good approach for me, especially still in lock down period.\n\nA: Some types of kernel extensions – including USB Networking – are deprecated in macOS 11.\nThese kernel extensions have to be rewritten by the vendor using DriverKit to be compatible with Big Sur. See https://developer.apple.com/support/kernel-extensions (USB networking).\nWhile macOS 11 is in development, you can enable the loading of deprecated KEXTs by disabling SIP. See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-beta-release-notes (Deprecations).\n\nA: Contact the vendor to get a driver which is compatible with Big Sur. It may take a while for the vendor to do so though (Big Sur is still in Beta after all), or never happen if they rather focus on selling you new stuff.\nAlternatively you may try https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter (which is linked from the Github page in your post) or ask the author to include support for your model.\n\nA: I face the same issue, I just plugged my Android phone with a USB cable and I enabled USB tethering on the phone and macOS Big Sur recognised it perfectly.\nThen I downloaded Mojave, made a USB pen drive for it and was able to go back to my old operating system.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2019 reset to factory: Mojave or Catalina? I am new to Macs. I need to reset my MacBook Pro 2019 to factory settings. It was on Mojave originally then I upgraded it to Catalina. My questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Should I follow the steps of reset for Mojave or Catalina?\n\n\n*What happens to FileVault encryption key when the laptop is reset? Does the encryption key remain the same?\nWhat I mean by factory reset is, see for example here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kPvfTdq_Vs\nPlease, advise. Thanks\n\nA: See Apple's documentation on Recovery Mode on ways to reinstall macOS and/or erase the disk. A simple reinstallation should not impact installed applications or user data, but as usual making a backup before is recommended. Also, downgrading from Catalina to Mojave always require changes in the disk format/partitions so you must make a backup before.\nWhich version of macOS is installed during Recovery can be partially influenced by the way Recovery Mode is launched (see https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204904):\n\n*\n\n*Cmd-R reinstalls the same version as currently installed\n\n*Opt-Cmd-R installs the newest version available\n\n*Shift-Opt-Cmd-R installs the version the Mac shipped with (or the oldest one still available if the shipped version isn't available any longer)\n\nIf you clean install macOS, you will \"wipe out\" any FileVault encryption so whether you have the key or not is rendered moot.  The boot firmware password, however, is not affected.\n\nA: There isn't really an option to 'reset to factory settings'. You can do a clean install of the OS on an erased volume.\nWhether you choose Mojave or Catalina is entirely up to you, depending on why you want to do this.\nIf you just erase the volume, then the encryption scheme should remain the same.\n", "Q: How can I specify a drive in Applescript without the drive name? I had a main system drive on my iMac named \"Macintosh HD\" and wrote my scripts to reference files on that drive.  For instance, to get to my library directory, I had \"Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:Dev:AppleScript:\" as the full path.\nThe problem is that I'm having drive issues and need to replace my drive before it goes bad.  To keep track, I cloned my original system drive (\"Macintosh HD\") to \"System Temp,\" which is connected by USB.  I can afford to use this drive for a few days, but need to return it to a server as soon as I can.  Early this week I'll be getting a new drive that will be the long term replacement drive, named, \"System.\"\nI don't want to name each drive \"Macintosh HD\" because that makes it hard for me to keep track of them, but I'd like to keep the scripts working throughout the process.\nHow can I, in Applescript, specify a pathname to a drive without using the HD name?  If it's the main HD, what is the equivalent of the Linux form of \"/\" for the root file system, so I'd use \"/home/me\" to get to my home directory?  Is there some way to do something like \"::Users:me\" instead?  I just want to be able to tell Applescript something like, \"This is on the main system drive,\" or, \"Use the boot drive.\"\nI tried a lot of possible alternatives and none worked.\n\nA: Instead of using HFS file paths, use posix paths.\nUse System Events for file operations, which handles posix paths as well as HFS paths.  It even knows how to expand the ~, so your home directory can be expressed simply as folder \"~/\", and your main disk is mounted at folder \"/\".\nAs for your attached USB drives, you essentially have to reference them by name.  They'll be listed under folder \"/Volumes\", or you can use this command (via System Events):\nget the name of every disk where it is ejectable -- i.e. attached drives\n\nI'm not entirely able to tell if I've answered all your questions.  Leave a comment and I'll fill in whatever seems missing.\n", "Q: Which changes are necessary for XM and XMTrading applications to both be approved and not rejected by Apple Guideline 4.3? There are two applications:\nOne you can see it directly in app store: https://apps.apple.com/gr/app/xm-trading-point/id1072084799\nThe second one I'll share it to you via Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xmtrading.webapp\nWhen the two aforementioned apps are being submitted to the same countries then they might be rejected with reason:\n\nGuideline 4.3 - Design\nThis app duplicates the content and functionality of other apps submitted by you or another developer to the App Store, which is considered a form of spam.\n\nWhich are the minimum amount of changes to be done in order for the two apps to not be considered similar and both be approved ?\n\nA: Apple Developer Guideline 4.3 states:\n\n4.3 Spam\nDon’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase. Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated; the App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc. already. We will reject these apps unless they provide a unique, high-quality experience. Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Developer Program.\n\nThis means you already have more than one app that does the exact same thing except there's slight variances.  This is not a new rule, it's been in place for years.  Apple started really enforcing it about 2 years ago.\nYour options are to either talk directly to Apple about what, specifically, caused them to reject the app or you can do what they suggest and put them into a single app.\nThere's nothing in 4.3 that states what you have to change, that's going to be different for each app.  Apple only states you must \"provide a unique, high-quality experience\".\n", "Q: Automate the repositioning and refreshing of menu bar icons? Background\nWhen menu bar items are rearranged manually using Cmd+drag, macOS writes a new \"preferred position\" preference to each app that is showing a menu bar icon. (This preference helps, but does not guarantee, that they retain their position for subsequent launches.)\nProblem\nI want to automate the saving of the menu bar icon positions, without interacting manually, for educational and accessibility reasons.\nQuestion\nHow can I automate the repositioning of a menu bar item (which will trigger the system to write the new prefs)?\nOr, how can I trigger macOS to write the new preferences directly (without automating a repositioning of a menu bar item)?\nI do not want to interact with the menu items manually, or write out the preferences myself.\n\nA: I've found a way to directly write the Preferred Position values using the shell command defaults. I'll leave the automation part out since I don't know the specifics of your project (I assume you know how to automate shell commands as the current user.) This should allow you to change the preferred values but won't move the menu bar items without a restart.\nBackground\n\nThe Defaults system is used to store certain user preferences on macOS. This happens to include the Preferred Position for Menu Bar items. I'll let Apple explain the basics better:\nFrom man defaults:\n\nDefaults allows users to read, write, and delete Mac OS X user defaults from a command-line shell. Mac OS X applications and other programs use the defaults system to record user preferences and other information that must be maintained when the applications aren't running (such as default font for new documents, or the position of an Info panel). Much of this information is accessible through an application's Preferences panel, but some of it isn't, such as the position of the Info panel.\n\n\nUser defaults belong to domains, which typically correspond to individual applications. Each domain has a dictionary of keys and values representing its defaults; for example, \"Default Font\" = \"Helvetica\". Keys are always strings, but values can be complex data structures comprising arrays, dictionaries, strings, and binary data. These data structures are stored as XML Property Lists.\n\nIn short, Defaults are categorized under Domains (the app or service the setting belongs to), are identified using Keys (the name of the particular setting), and each *Key has a Value assigned to it.\n\nThe Preferred Position defaults we care about are not all under one domain, since individual apps can add new items to the Menu Bar. However, the keys all share this format:\nNSStatusItem Preferred Position <menu-item-name>\nwhere <menu-item-name> is the name of each item a particular app or service adds.\nThe values are all stored as float numbers, usually integers but some have a decimal point.\nHere are the macOS built-in Menu Item Defaults on my machine as an example.\n'com.apple.systemuiserver': {\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Item-0\" = 23;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri\" = 61;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.TimeMachine\" = 548;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.airport\" = 483;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.battery\" = 179;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.bluetooth\" = 513;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.textinput\" = 127;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.volume\" = 260;\n}\n\ncom.apple.systemuiserver is a domain containing the key NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri with value 61.\nListing All Current Preferred Position Defaults\n\nIn order to list all the domains, keys, and values for our Preferred Position Defaults, we can use the defaults find command to search for matches.\nThe command we need in this instance is defaults find \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position\".\n$ defaults find \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position\"\nFound 1 keys in domain 'com.coconut-flavour.coconutBattery-Menu': {\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Item-0\" = \"344.5\";\n}\nFound 1 keys in domain 'com.lastpass.LastPass': {\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Item-0\" = 795;\n}\nFound 8 keys in domain 'com.apple.systemuiserver': {\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Item-0\" = 23;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri\" = 61;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.TimeMachine\" = 548;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.airport\" = 483;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.battery\" = 179;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.bluetooth\" = 513;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.textinput\" = 127;\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position com.apple.menuextra.volume\" = 260;\n}\nFound 1 keys in domain 'org.pqrs.Karabiner-Menu': {\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Item-0\" = 750;\n}\nFound 1 keys in domain 'com.google.GoogleDrive': {\n    \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Item-0\" = 607;\n}\n... and so on ...\n\nReading and Writing the Value of a Given Domain & Key\n\nIn order to read the value of a given domain and key, we need to use the defaults read command. To write, we use defaults write.\nHere, I will read the value of the key NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri at the com.apple.systemuiserver domain.\nNote that the domain and key must be enclosed in double quotes.\n$ defaults read \"com.apple.systemuiserver\" \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri\"\n61\n\nHere, I will change the the key NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri at the com.apple.systemuiserver domain to the value 42.7.\nNote that the domain and key must be enclosed in double quotes, and the -float before the value\n$ defaults write \"com.apple.systemuiserver\" \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri\" -float 42.7\n$ defaults read \"com.apple.systemuiserver\" \"NSStatusItem Preferred Position Siri\"\n42.7\n\n\nAgain, I'll leave exactly how you automate this up to you, but this can all be easily integrated into your code.\nIf this doesn't work out for you, here are some links to the Apple Developer AppKit docs for adding items to the Menu Bar as well as for accessing the Defaults system using objective-c and swift. Not sure if they'll be any use to you but maybe they'll set you on the right track.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstatusitem\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstatusbar\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults\n\nA: I believe you are referring the invisble file called \".DS_STORE\".\nIf you are command-line comfortable:\nYou can run this command to disable the writing of that file.\n# Avoid creating .DS_Store files on network volumes\n(sudo) defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true\n# this should be run in your HOME directory. the \".\" means it will use the current folder.\n# alternately you could test on one folder.\nfind . -type f -name '*.DS_Store' -ls -delete\n\nAll previous folders should have their \".DS_STORE\" files deleted using this command.\nAfter you delete these files, you can set the \"Show View Options\" under the view menu in the finder to how you want it, and \"make default\".\nIf you share directories with other mac users, their .DS_Store files will be created and affect your view. So it really is only effective in your personal environment.\n", "Q: IPad app to annotate PDF without showing a toolbar I want to find an iPad app that allows me to annotate a PDF with an Apple Pemcil while all the app’s toolbars and navigation menus etc. are hidden.\nIdeally, I would like to select an annotation tool (say a highlighter or pencil), hide the toolbars, and then just go through the document (a lecture that I am recording) occasionally highlighting or writing a few words here and there. I don’t want the mostly-unused toolbars to clutter up each and every slide.\nApps like Notability and PDF Expert hide their toolbars while in “presentation mode”, but ONLY when the content is being mirrored by HDMI or AirPlay, and not when connected to the Mac (doing the recording) by cable.\nBasically, I want an PDF annotation app with a “presentation mode” equivalent that the user can choose to enter when they want, regardless of how the iPad is connected externally.\n\nA: Just found an app that somewhat does this after looking for quite a while: PDF Reader & Annotator by Xodo. It allows using the Apple Pencil as “ink” when the toolbar is hidden.\n", "Q: Calling AppleScript routine using osascript Given the following AppleScript code\non myHandler()\n    display dialog (\"I'm your Handler!\")\nend myHandler\n\nHow do I call myHandler from osascript (using Terminal), plain without parameters, but also with?\n\nA: \non myHandler()\n   display dialog (\"I'm your Handler!\")\nend myHandler\n\nHow do I call myHandler from osascript (using Terminal)\n\nAssuming your shell is bash or zsh, there are a couple of ways, depending on your needs or preferences.  You can send your code through directly, which only needs an extra line at the bottom in this case to actually call the handler in order to execute its code (just as you did in your Python code: \"{applescript.read()}\\nmyHandler()\"):\nosascript <<-'osa'\n    on myHandler()\n        display dialog (\"I'm your Handler!\")\n    end myHandler\n\n   myHandler()\nosa\n\nIf you, say, stored your script in a file, which was located at ~/Documents/myscript.applescript, then you can pass the file into osascript like so:\nosascript ~/Documents/myscript.applescript\n\nOf course, you would still need to include the call to your handler in your .applescript file, i.e. an extra line at the end or the beginning of your script that simply says myHandler()\nIf you wanted to pass a commandline parameter to make the contents of the dialog more dynamic, you can edit your script to look like this:\nproperty text item delimiters: space\n\non run input as text\n    myHandler(input)\nend run\n\non myHandler(msg as text)\n    local msg\n    display dialog msg\nend myHandler\n\nThen call it from the command line like this:\nosascript ~/Documents/myscript.applescript \"It worked!\"\n\nHopefully, if I anticipated my example script's set up correctly, it should work without the quotes:\nosascript ~/Documents/myscript.applescript Do these words have a space between them \\?\n\n\nA: Found a workaround. Not clean, but it works. In my case with Python:\nimport subprocess\n    \nwith open(\"script.scpt\") as applescript:\n    subprocess.run([\"/usr/bin/osascript\", \"-e\", f\"{applescript.read()}\\nmyHandler()\"])````\n\n", "Q: Automatically print incoming email on an iPad I'd like to automatically print all incoming email to my printer.\nI don't think there's any way to do this with the native mail client, perhaps there is another app that does this?\nIt's definitley possible to do this with the desktop versions of Outlook or Thunderbird, I'm trying to set this up on an iPad.\n\nA: Going from this comment:\n\nIt would be one email per page. The idea is to automatically print out order emails so that they can be fulfilled.\n\nYou're using the wrong product for your purposes.\nThere are much less complex and more reliable solutions\n\n*\n\n*Printers with email addresses like HP's ePrint  The printer has it's own address and you can literally email (or forward) the message to the printer\n\n\n*Apple's (or any other *nix for that matter) built in mail facility.  A simple and very short batch program can be used to access and print all mail sent or fetched) from a computer.\n\n\n*The full blown Outlook client supports rules that allow you to print all incoming mail based on criteria you set.\n\n\n*Purpose built software such as Email to Print from Papercut will retrieve mail from a mail server and print it based on rules (like Outlook client)\nActually, the worst thing you can do is set this up on a mobile device like an iPad.  The moment it goes to sleep, all processing is done.  If the process is pushed the the background, the email to print processing stops.  If the device is dropped, it stops.\nIf you're taking orders to be fulfilled, you likely have a computer (or even a server) already for other purposes (accounting, internal website, etc.) that can handle this processing for you without trying to bodge something on a mobile device.\n\nA: I am quite sure that this is not possible on iPad because you always need to click \"Print\" if you start the printing process on iPad.\n\nIn my opinion this dialogue is obligatory.\n", "Q: Changing Apple ID on Macbook to match ID on iPhone and iPad My 13” Mac has a different Apple ID than my iPad and iPhone. I’d like to change the Apple ID on my mac so I can utilize apps properly.\n\nA: Sign out of the old Apple ID on the mac, knowing that you need to keep all the content there. Apps will lose permissions / update while you switch in the proper Apple ID.\nSign in with the proper AppleID so you can share all the data and other apps. They when you have an update, sign back in with the original AppleID (only if you want) to allow updates to the previously purchased apps, but not lose the data syncing from iCloud on the same account on both platforms.\n", "Q: Apple TV 3rd generation.

Thanks\n\nA: The Apple TV 3rd Gen has no true storage at all & only 512MB RAM - it was discovered it does actually have a 'hidden' 8GB, but presumably that will be caching content for immediate use rather than storing a movie you watched previously.\n38 minutes to download a movie/TV show would indicate your internet connection is struggling.\nFrom Everymac -\n\n*Officially, the third generation Apple TV models have no internal storage.

The only time this is an issue is when it's \"elevated self-discharge.\"  So your Macbook needn't be powered-on therefore to suffer some degree of battery drain.\nSo battery drain in a powered-down state isn't the problem- it happens to all chemical batteries.  Your issue is that it's at an elevated level, which might indicate the battery requires replacement as the 2nd link talks about. Apparently 5% loss within 24 hours and 1-2% per day thereafter is expected for Lithium batteries. Yours is definitely draining at a much higher rate.\nIf you go to the \"Power\" section of \"System Report\" you can check the status of your battery to see if it's misbehaving as mine apparently is in my 2018 Macbook!:\n\nSo assuming you're 100% sure that the affected Macbook isn't in a sleep state, but fully powered down, this looks a lot like a hardware issue regarding the battery.

I'm making a reaction video and I need the face reaction as well as the screen capture. I've tried 'Go Record', 'Record it!' apps that makes the face videos appear on the screen. I'm not looking for that kind of recording app nor using two separate devices to record.\nSo in short,\n\n*\n\n*Is iphone able to record two videos simultaneously?\n\n*If so, is there an app to do so.\n\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, the iPhone is able to record two videos simultaneously.\nBut no, I don't think there is an app that does what you want. As I understand it, you want to do screen capture of any app, and simultaneously record the front-facing camera using a different app, than the one being screen captured. That is not possible.\nYou can do screen recording of any app simply by using the built-in screen recording feature of iOS.\nYou can also record using the front-facing camera at the same time using the built-in Camera app, or any other app that offers video recording. You can probably get an app that will record without actually showing the video on screen.\nHowever, you cannot then switch to a different app (for example a game) and have the camera keep recording in the background.\nIf you do not want to use two devices to be able to do this, a work-around could be to record the screen capture first, and then record the reactions after the fact and edit them into the video. This is how some Youtubers add small reactions to their content.\n", "Q: Screen-Lock Breaks Uploads I've noticed that when uploading long-ish videos to social media, if the device goes to autolock, invariably I'll see the upload failed.

Also, in video calls some people talk really softly and some are really loud.\nIs here an app which can act as a high pass filter for high pitch and frequency sounds?\n\nA: I recommend Rouge Amoebas Audio Hijack.\nWhat you are looking for is actually a low pass filter. Low frequencies should pass it, high frequencies should be attenuated.\nAudio Hijack is a high-quality macOS audio tool, which offers not only audio manipulation via an equalizer, but also a dedicated low pass filter.\n\nStart Audio Hijack, add a New Session and select the preset Sweeten. This is a pre-build audio enhancement workflow for all sounds that are played by your selected output device. Then select the category Build-in effects and drag the Low Pass Filter block into the audio processing chain. It should look like the screenshot i attached. You can easily customize the cutoff frequency with a slider.\nAs soon as you press the start button on the bottom left, the audio effects will be applied.\nIn case a plain old equalizer is sufficient for you, you can try the free eqMac App.\n", "Q: How active is my mobile phone when I'm not using it? I wonder whether there is any study/website/research work or a place to check how much data my phone is sending when I'm not using it. My question is: when my phone is off, but I'm not actively using it (just left it on my desk) do any of the apps on my phone send any network data to servers, etc.? Can I somehow check this information on my phone (I have iPhone 7) or maybe someone already did such an analysis?\n\nA: Since iOS 10, I’ve seen very good ability to control activity. Even better, you can see exactly what runs, hour per hour what’s front most and what background apps are taking energy.\n\nIf you want no background - just turn that off for all apps. Then review the activity graphs for a couple days. If you want more activity, enable background and remove apps that are more active than you care or selectively disable background activity so you know apps only run when you ask them to run.\n\nIf you’re technically minded, the Charles proxy is excellent to log outbound traffic without needing to manage your router. I also use Ubiquiti network routers so know and log access / block some traffic, but that’s on the network side, not the iOS side.\nI don’t think getting outside analyses are as important as choosing your apps so you know how they are funding development. If the app is slick and free, you’re paying them in data / marketing / eyeballs in many cases.\n\nA: \nI wonder whether there is any study/website/research work or a place to check how much data my phone is sending when I'm not using it.\n\nYes.  I found this research article (behind a paywall) that discusses these points from a battery and energy optimization point of view:  Smartphone Background Activities in the Wild: Origin, Energy Drain, and Optimization\nFrom the Abstract\n\n\n*\n\n*First, we present a large-scale measurement study that performs an in-depth analysis of the activities of various apps running in background on thousands of phones in the wild.\n\n\n*Second, we quantify the amount of battery drain by all such background activities and possible energy saving.\n\n\n*Third, we develop a metric to measure the usefulness of background activities that is personalized to each user.\n\n\n*Finally, we present a system called HUSH (screen-off optimizer) that monitors the metric online and automatically identifies and suppresses background activities during screen-off periods that are not useful to the user experience.\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2789168.2790107\n", "Q: How do you turn on a send verification prompt for text messages on iPhone?

Unfortunately, Bootcamp Assistant insists on this boot media and completely ignores the bootable Windows 10 USB that I have plugged in.\nI followed these instructions and it got me as far as installing and an initial run of Windows OS. But things get impossibly complicated the moment I update drivers either via Apple's Bootcamp driver package or Windows Update. Going either way results in blue screen and/or endless restart/repair cycle that can't be fixed by anything I tried. There's always a problem with one of the mountmgr.sys or igdkmd64.sys drivers.\nHaving thought that the graphics driver is the most probable culprit, I tried disabling the built-in Intel HD graphis card, hoping it would help, but to no avail. Sooner or later, the thing blue screens.\nI've already wasted 10 hours on this. What bugs me is the fact that this very laptop used to run Windows on Bootcamp successfully in the past, but it was installed via Bootcamp Assistant from a DVD. Since this is no longer an option, my only hope is USB.\nHow can I make the Bootcamp Assistant recognize my bootable USB stick?\nUPDATE\nI tried to install Windows 8.1, as suggested. I used the official ISO from microsoft.com. The installer proceeded to copy all the files, but then, at the end, it complained that it couldn't update the boot configuration. After restart, I found that that Windows partition is unbootable. I can still get into the OS X by holding down the Option key at boot, but Windows is no go.\nI tried installing the Windows 10 again, this time disabling internet connection during setup. I got much further, because it didn't try to automatically install drivers. I then tried manually installing latest NVidia driver for my GeForce GT 330M card. It succeeded, but the driver wouldn't take for some reason. Looking at Windows Device Manager, there was an unspecified problem with the display adapter corresponding to the NVidia card.\nWhat else can I try? I have no clue.\nUPDATE 2\nI've now even tried it with an official Windows 7 ISO. This one won't go past the very first \"Windows is loading files...\" setup screen, before even copying any files. It just hangs at that point.\nIt's starting to really look like I'm not getting any Windows version on this MacBook... Which is sad. The only reason I want Windows is because my kids would like to play a Windows-only networked game with me, and this is the only other free computer we have...\n\nA: The instructions, you have linked to, install Windows to EFI boot. The Boot Camp drivers provide by Apple were designed for a BIOS booting Windows. In other words, you need to hybrid partition the drive and the instructions explicitly insure the drive is using a fully protected MBR. If you can select EFI Boot of the Windows 10 installation flash drive from the Mac Startup Manager and successfully boot from the flash drive, then you can install a BIOS booting Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 to your Mac. However, you will have to use the command line (CLI) to install. In your case, the graphical user interface (GUI) provided by Microsoft will only allow EFI booting installations.\nThe are many examples on the web of how to use the CLI to install Windows. For example, these instructions install for a dual boot. Perhaps you could adapt the instructions for your use.\n", "Q: How to clone my HHD to SSD on my mid-2009 Macbook Pro I'm trying to clone my 680GB HDD to a new 500GB SSD, trying EaseUS and Carbon Copy Cloner. The goal is to replace my HDD with the SSD, so I need to boot from it. There's only about 100GB of used disk space on my HDD so I figured it's doable to clone, unless it's literally trying to copy every sector, empty or not, in which case my SSD is too small.\nAny thoughts on how to do this? Would using the Disk Utility be another option? I've read up on Time Machine, or Restore option in Disk Utility, but it's hard to find a clear answer and so far what I've tried hasn't worked. I managed to copy the contents over to the SSD but it won't boot up from it. And when I tried reassigning the startup disk to my SSD, it still didn't boot from it. Not sure what else to try. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend having the boot drive mounted to do a proper clone. If you have an external drive (preferably firewire 800 for that model, but USB 2 will also work), install a current versions of macOS onto it. Boot to that drive by restarting and holding down the Option key at boot, and you can select the external bootable drive. Now that you are booted to your external, install your clone software of choice, in your case Carbon Copy Cloner (I personally like SuperDuper! but that is me). Once you have the software installed, start cloning the boot disk to the new SSD.\nAs a side note, make sure that you partition your new SSD before you start the process. That way you don't run into an error because it is FAT32 partitioned and not GUID.\n", "Q: Turn off the ability for users to have a password hint I am working on a security setting for my company that requires users to not have a password hint. Since we have several users that either\n\n*\n\n*ignore our security options and\n\n*purposely go against ones they don't like, I need a way to turn it off in terminal for 10.13-10.15.\n\nI know I could create a script that pulls the User lists, and repopulates the opendirectory command to insert a 'blank' password (dscl . -merge /Users/username hint \"password hint\"), but I would like to turn off the ability as part of the setup. I have scoured the Internet and found nothing so far.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\nPS. I also want to build a profile for it, but we are a ways away from profile management but any suggestions on that would be helpful as well.\n\nA: The ability to disable Passwords Hints has been built into macOS\nSystem Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Options.  Just make sure \"Show Password Hints\" is unchecked.\n\nUsing Terminal, you can issue the command:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow RetriesUntilHint -int 0\n\nYour security policy\nYou aren't alone in dealing with employees/users who what to go against the grain so to speak when it comes to security.  The users that you described:  the ones who ignore your security and the ones who actively go against your policies can actually be the biggest threats to data security.\nFirst thing to know is that there is no technology you can implement that will secure a user who ignores your security policy - i.e (don't use personal email accounts when sending sensitive documents) or employees that circumvent them (puts a Post-It note with their password on the screen because it needs to be changed every 90 days).\n\n*\n\n*The very first thing you need to do is define the security policy and why it's being defined.  Describe what data or system (or whatever) you are protecting and the risk it poses if it's compromised (i.e. loss of revenue, litigation, etc.).\n\n\n*The very next thing is to get buy in from management.  Not only should you periodically remind employees, but have an official communication come from management spelling out the policy - don't do this alone!\n\n\n*Thirdly, involve HR (or whoever is ultimately responsible for hiring and firing) to spell out the consequences of not adhering to the policy.\nWhy is this important?\nAs an IT manager, I can't tell you the number of times a data breach occurred not because I or the systems I put in place failed, but people who didn't like the policies actively went around them.  Having these operational policies in place squarely puts the burden on the employee and management and not you.  Now, as an IT consultant (I charge for this type of analysis) I can't tell you how many times my business increased because the IT manager took my report, went back to management and said \"see, I told you so.\"\nObviously, I'm speaking in broad terms, but the takeaway from this is to not shoulder security by yourself.  Define your policy, use whatever tech is available (can afford) and get buy in from the whole organization.\n\nA: If you are working on security then can I recommend that you use the Center for Internet Security benchmarks. They include tunring off password hints. Katie English at Jamf has developed a set of scripts that allows you to check the status of of the benchmarks on a machine and remediate anything broken. The CIS benchmarks also give you an easy way to discuss securing your Macs with your management or security team. You can find the security benchmarks on the CIS website.\n", "Q: Can I patch arbitrary apps to add Speak Text accessibility to macOS apps that don’t support it? In many (if not, most) Mac apps that display or edit text, you can select text and have it spoken out loud, via a right-click or the Edit menu:\n\nNote: I am aware of the Accessibility setting that assigns a keyboard shortcut to speak text… but it doesn't always behave as you'd expect and sometimes reads text from the page that is not highlighted.\nSome apps that you would expect to have this ability, don't… which is a pretty big accessibility issue for lots of folks (myself included).\nIs there any way to forcibly get this functionality into uncooperative apps?\n\nA: The easy answer is no.\nThe more complex answer, is that it usually depends on the accessibility of the app. If an app doesn’t use the proper accessibility labels and APIs, it won’t work properly with other assistive technologies like voiceover and speak screen. A classic example of this not working is in an image\n", "Q: Startup security utility menu not properly popping up I am trying to configure the security utility but I get this menu instead: \nWhat I am doing is attempting to install windows on an external drive.

(this is the correct procedure)\nIf you restart your Mac and then go straight into recovery that is actually (fallback macOS Recovery) so terminal and startup security will not work it's only meant to reinstall the OS and fix disk issues.\nThe correct method to resolve this issue from apple themselves is:\nMacOS Recovery requires:\n\n*\n\n*The silicon Mac to be shutdown first\n\n*wait 5 seconds after the screen goes black\n\n*Then press and hold the power button, don't let go until you see \"loading startup options\"\n\n*Then everything will work\n\n*Same process goes for T2 chip Macs\n\n(if they still don't and your sure you followed all instructions a slight possibly the firmware needs to be revived: but at a last restort)\n", "Q: Any way to know if a USB attached drive to a Mac is HDD or SSD? I'm very puzzled that when you click \"Info\" for a SSD drive connected with USB in Disk Utility, it says:\nSolid State: NO\nAny way to know if a USB attached drive to a Mac is HDD or SSD?  Best if you can know in macOS, without third party tool.\nIt's a 2.5\" SSD connected to a USB port.\nAny help much welcome.\n\nA: It depends.  If the external USB controller supports the whole set of ATA commands you can find out if the drive attached is solid state or not.  See the following post for several ways to determine if your drive attached is solid state or not.\nHow to determine if a drive is Solid State via Terminal\nThough the driver in macOS is very limited, macOS has this ability to identify the  drive attached.  The second part that’s required for this to work is the USB to SATA bridge (the chip in the enclosure) must provide this capability.  Many off brand vendors use chips that only provide read/write functionality because they are substantially cheaper than quality chips that support more functions.\nYou can see this in smartmontools (excellent utility for monitoring drive SMART status via the command line) USB support wiki where they state to support USB they need:\n\n*\n\n*The USB bridge provides an ATA or NVMe pass-through command.\n\n*The operating system provides a SCSI pass-through I/O-control which works through its USB-layer.\n\nmacOS doesn’t support the pass through of the whole ATA command set (Why it’s limited) and thus you need a special driver for smartmontools.  But if the USB device doesn’t suport it, theres no 3rd party driver that will give you this ability.\n\nA: MacOS is limited in the data about the drive that it can obtain via USB. If you look, the next line down says \"SMART Status: Unsupported\".\nIf you have a drive connected via Thunderbolt, it will support SMART status and accurately report the drive's type.\nI suspect that Disk Utility reports that it's not an SSD unless it specifically knows that it is an SSD. And it can't get that information over USB.\n\nA: Go to About this Mac under the apple menu. After clicking on About this Mac you get a small pane with 2 options - choose system report. Rhis bring up a large panel. From the column on the left select \"Storage\", its about half-way down that 1st column. When you click on that the right side of the panel will list all storage devices connected to your machine, Click on the device you're interested in and facts abiut the device should list.

I think it only lists this for SSD's.\n", "Q: System kext not loading in Catalina I finally figured out what the problem was for my other question, which was sadly closed even though it had a clear problem to solve. Briefly, the problem is that my dGPU 750M in my late 2013 15\" MacBook Pro gets stuck in a high power state, pulling 17W at idle instead of 3W. I installed Catalina fresh on an external drive and that fixed my dGPU being stuck in a higher power state.\nI compared the system kernel extensions loaded on the fresh Catalina install with those loaded on the problematic install and made a list of all the kexts that did not load in the problematic Catalina install. The problem is that the system is not loading these kexts from /system/library/extensions:\nIOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/contents/plugins/x86platformplugin.kext\nIOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/contents/plugins/ioplatformpluginlegacy.kext\nIOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/contents/plugins/acpi_smc_platformplugin.kext\nIOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/contents/plugins/x86platformshim.kext\napplegraphicspowermanagement.kext\nappleplatformenabler.kext\nIn fact my issue is fixed by simply just loading x86platformplugin.kext:\nsudo kextload IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/contents/plugins/x86platformplugin.kext\n\nHowever it's probably best to load all of those that are present on a clean Catalina install and not present on my problematic install.\nAfter loading x86platformplugin.kext manually, toggling on the 750M dGPU results in it being able to use its low power state, consuming just 3W at idle compared to 17W otherwise.\nWhy aren't these kexts loading on my problematic Catalina install? How do I get these kexts to load automatically after reboot?\n\nA: If a simple terminal command is working for you, then you can create a logon script as an ugly hack and use it for a few months.\nThe next macOS will release in the fall so it might fix things for you.\n", "Q: Can an Automator workflow generate an Application? I'm building a \"Wizard\" of sorts that uses Automator and some Appliescript, and at the end I would like it to generate an \"Automator Application\" that does things when launched, that are based on the inputs from the wizard.\nIs this even possible?  Can one Automator workflow, actually generate an application from the results?  I know software can create software, but is this possible within Automator's capabilities?\nEDIT:  As noted in the comments below the post, osacompile seems like it might get me where I want to go, but now I have a new problem with that.\nHere's a screenshot of my automator steps:\n\nHere's the code of the erroring module (Send iMessage):\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    set sms_address to item 1 of input\n    set email_address to item 2 of input\n    set sms_content to item 3 of input\n    set email_subject to item 4 of input\n    set email_body to item 5 of input\n    \n    set savePath to (path to desktop as text) & \"test.scpt\"\n    \n    set code to \"osacompile -e 'tell application \\\"Messages\\\"' -e ' \n    set imessageservice to 1st service whose service type = iMessage' -e '\n    set iMessageBuddy to buddy \" & sms_address & \" of imessageservice' -e '\n    send \" & sms_content & \" to iMessageBuddy' -e '\n    end tell' -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of savePath\n    \n    do shell script code\n    \n    return input\nend run\n\nNote that the lines are broken up that way because it was the only approach I could find where I didn't get any errors just because of adding line breaks (I can put this code all on one line and get the identical error)\nHere's the error I receive:\n\nI haven't been able to figure out what the problem is here but it seems like I'm not passing the variables in the way a bash script expects.  Have tried a bunch of other approaches and nothing has worked any better, but this is the one that seems the most sensible to me, knowing how I would normally pass variables into a script.\nEDIT 2:  To simplify further, here is the standalone code I'm current debugging in AppleScript Editor and without any line breaks to not confuse the issue:\nset sms_address to \"person@gmail.com\"\nset sms_content to \"sms content\"\n\nset savePath to (path to desktop as text) & \"test.scpt\"\n\nset code to \"osacompile -e 'tell application \\\"Messages\\\"' -e ' set imessageservice to 1st service whose service type = iMessage' -e 'set iMessageBuddy to buddy \" & sms_address & \" of imessageservice' -e 'send \" & sms_content & \" to iMessageBuddy' -e 'end tell' -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of savePath\n\ndo shell script code\n\n\nA: So from the edits to my post, I was on the right track.  But I forgot that the final script needs to have quotes around the content being passed in!  This is the code snippet that ultimately worked:\nset sms_address to \"sms_address\"\nset sms_body to \"sms_body\"\nset filename to \"filename\"\nset savePath to (path to desktop as text) & filename & \".scpt\"\n\nset code to \"osacompile -e '\ntell application \\\"Messages\\\" \n    set imessageservice to 1st service whose service type = iMessage \n    set iMessageBuddy to buddy \\\"sms_address\\\" of imessageservice \n    send \\\"sms_body\\\" to iMessageBuddy\nend tell' -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of savePath\n\ndo shell script code\n\nSo I was on the right path all along, just needed to excape those double quotes.\n", "Q: How can I rename Device ID from disk1s5 to disk1s1 My brand new MacBook Pro 16\" had \"Macintosh HD\" at disk1s1 and \"Macintosh HD - Data\" at disk1s2. I didn't realize the USB-C cable that came with it wasn't Thunderbolt 3 so I killed the Migration Assistant and ordered the cable online. When the cable came I reformatted the disk to start over and for the life of me I can't get the Device ID to match what they were out of the box. I've tried starting with a brand new Partition and installing from Disk Recovery, then running Migration Assistant (using the TB3 cable that came today) but now I'm getting Macintosh HD on disk1s5 (was on s1) and Macintosh HD - Data on disk1s1 (was on s2). I realize this doesn't impact the performance in any way but it's bugging me that I can't get it back to the way it came out of the box.\n\nA: Device IDs are what the system uses to identify the drive.  They often change depending on when and even where they are detected (Internal vs. USB vs Thunderbolt).\nFor instance, an old hard drive bootable drive might be identified as disk1s2.  Take it out and put it in a USB enclosure, attach it to another Mac and it  suddenly becomes disk3.\nThis is not something you need to try and manage and trying to make of “match what came out of the box” does nothing except create a massive amount work on your part.\nNow the fact that the data partition went from slice 2 (disk1s2) to slice 5 (disk1s5) tells me that you may not have removed/reformatted the drive properly.  However, this is now moving into a new question so issue the command diskutil apfs list and post it to a new question as to the structure of your partition layout.\n\nA: Hey @motoservo there's an answer to your question kindly provided by @david-anderson if you still need it! P.S. You will likely need to use Terminal to remove old APFS Container without reboot, use this answer by @david-anderson for commands.\n\nA: Shortest possible answer... You can't!\nPartial explanation... disk1s5 & disk1s1 are system device IDs, assigned at mount time. If you examine carefully, a given drive might have a different device ID from one boot of your Mac to the next. That's not very human friendly & is one reason why we have volume names. Device IDs for drives apply to logical volumes, not physical drives, so under Catalina & later \"Macintosh HD\" (or whatever you've renamed it to) will have 2 device IDs, because the System is on a write only partition & everything else on another partition.\n", "Q: Can replacing wires fix a display I dropped my laptop on the ground.  For about 7 days the display would not work though the hard drive was fine.  I could use the computer with a different display.  The display has magically started working again but it has flickered off for a few seconds twice over a period of ten minutes.  Perhaps the only thing that is wrong is that some wires went ajar during the dropping and they just need to be replaced.   Can one purchase wires and easily replace them?  I have a Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2015.\n\nA: No, on the newer MBPs, the display cable is basically integral to the \"Display Assembly\" part, even if it is just the cable that was damaged it is not replaceable on its own, not \"easily\" by any reasonable standard.\nRealistically if the display cable is seriously damaged you need to replace the entire display half of the laptop.\nIf it is only the display connector that is damaged, it may be possible to repair but the smt soldering needed for such a job means it would not be easy either, though you might be able to find a third party repair shop that could do it for you without replacing half the laptop.\nThough I don't think it is likely, if the problem is that the display cable connector simply came loose, then that would be an easy fix. But I feel that would just be wishful thinking.\n\nA: \nCan one purchase wires and easily replace them?\n\nThe “wires” is called a flex cable and it can be purchased.\nEasily?  That depends on your level of technical skill.\nTypically, wires don’t “go ajar;” connectors break.  You may have broken solder joints, a connector my be damaged connector on the logic board.

Also, it becomes really hot when I use heavy software like Final Cut Pro and starts hanging.\nI went to the Apple Store and they asked me to reinstall macOS, which didn't work. The common issue with the question mark problem is the SSD, but in my case its not the SSD.

I have an early-2015 MacBook Pro 13\" whose battery status has changed from normal to 'service recommended' state. The cycle count is around 367 and the battery backup runs strong at around 4-5 hours. My understanding of the service recommended status is that the cells in the battery have begun deteriorating, resulting in less than optimal battery capacity and therefore charge backup. Is it possible to predict how long, if I were to keep going about my business, the battery has before it completely runs out?\nWe have authorized Apple resellers only here so options to get the battery officially serviced are limited. Last year, the battery on my personal early 2015 MacBook Pro 13\", with half the cycle count of the battery on this work machine, suddenly changed to \"change battery\" status from normal, and stopped giving me any backup.

Having a infected MacBook to start with, or sharing the AppleID between devices, may make it easier (or open additional attack vectors), but at the end it's always a weakness on the attacked device which makes it possible.\n\nA: Yes, with the emphasis on 'can'.

Further, will it tidy up by removing such apps or will I end up with non-runnable apps to manually clean up?\n\nA: 32-bit apps in Mojave should already bring up a warning when you launch them.\nYou can check what 32-bit apps you have in System Information: Click to open the Apple menu, then hold Option and click on System Information, which appears where 'About This Mac' was.\nThen choose 'Applications' from the sidebar, under Software. This will show you whether the app is 64-bit or not. You can sort the list by that column, giving you all the apps in one place.\n\nCatalina will not remove any apps: it will just leave them in place.\n", "Q: Is there any solution to remove the macOS App - Prepare for Submission? As you can see I wanted to update my iOS App 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 but I accidentally added the macOS App.\n\nAfter searching some solution on a couple website, I still can't find the solution...\nSome say you can remove the \"Prepare for Submission\" in the \"App Information\" but I think that is not the correct way. I use that way, I think you will delete the whole App.\nEven I wanted to try remove it but in the \"App Information\", I still can't see the \"Remove\" Button that I wanted... What can do I?\nOther's people screenshot:\n\nMy case:\n\nI even have go to the apple developer documentation have a look but their link is not working...(https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/)\nAll the link that I press in the apple documentation is just keep loading just like below this image.\n\nIs there any solution to remove the macOS App - Prepare for Submission?\n\nA: It's not possible to remove a version of your app in Prepare for Submission state.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple at feedbackassistant.apple.com.\n\nA: According to Apple's Developer site:\n\nRemove a build from review\nTo stop the App Review process, you can remove the app version from App Review. The app status must be one of the following to do this:\n\n*\n\n*Waiting for Export Compliance\n\n*Waiting for Review\n\n*In Review\n\n*Pending Developer Release\n\n*Pending Apple Release\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager.\n\n*\n\n*From My Apps, select your app. The page opens with the App Store tab selected.\n\n\n*In the sidebar, click the app version you want a build removed from review for.\n\n\n*In the message that appears up top, click “remove this version from review.”\n\n\n\n*In the dialog that appears, click Remove.\nThe app version is removed from Apple’s review queue and the app status changes to Developer Rejected. Later, when you resubmit the app, the review process will start over from the beginning.\n\n", "Q: Delete Users and Separate User and Groups I am using a Mac for both personal and work and want to keep them separate as I can. I think a good solution would be for me to have 2 users -- a personal and work user -- but the only problem is when I download software in my personal account it appears in my work user account. Luckily I caught this early enough I could just delete my work user, but can't seem to be able to do that.\nHow do I delete a user? How do I keep the user profiles separate so what I download in one doesn't show up in the other?\n\nA: Normally, if you download something (apps, files, anything): it is saved in your User account's Download folder.\nWhen applications arrive, it is usual to copy or install them into the root level /Applications folder. This location is accessible to all users.\nIf you want applications to be available to only one user, then move them to <user>/Applications. You may need to create this folder inside your user account.\n\nA: Install the apps you want to use as both users in ~/Public. This works even for users without administrator rights.\n", "Q: Ensuring consistency and minimal interference during benchmarking? I am attempting to measure the performance of a common piece of software on the current line up of 13” and 16\" for the purpose of comparison between models.\nAnalysing the specs “on paper” may not be ideal since CPUs and memory can perform differently depending on how the software utilizes them, and obvious metrics (clock speeds, cores, memory type and memory GB) don't always correlate with actual performance.\nI am working on some simple, reproducible tests to benchmark performance on across MBPs and generate some real, empirical data. They will resemble real-life workflows, and be focussed on heavy compute and heavy memory use. All up they will take under 2 hours per machine, and they don't require Internet.\nQuestion: how should each MBP be prepared before each test is run? There is a strong desire to ensure maximum consistency/accuracy across tests and therefore a fair comparison.\nSome things I have considered so far:\n\n*\n\n*WiFi and bluetooth off\n\n*Consistent room temperature and (sun) lighting conditions\n\n*Close as many unnecessary applications as possible, leaving open only what is necessary for the OS and for the testing software\n\n*I am not sure what else, or if there is any established 'best practice'. I am particularly concerned about any 'background' tasks which I may not be aware of which could run during the test and affect the results\n\n\nA: Items you've considered are already good! Disabling internet stops lot of stray processes.\nYou can try Safe mode to do the tests if they don't need the services disabled in that mode. Also consider making a new user account for doing the testing.\nhttps://support.apple.com/HT201262\n\nSafe mode prevents your Mac from loading certain software as it starts up, including login items, system extensions not required by macOS, and fonts not installed by macOS. It also does a basic check of your startup disk, similar to using First Aid in Disk Utility. And it deletes some system caches, including font caches and the kernel cache, which are automatically created again as needed.\n\nThat's the closest you can get to a brand new Mac.\nAlso, if the tests' results use huge storage, its best to delete them after every run since remaining storage also affects VM usage and increases memory pressure.\n\nA: To do any sort of benchmarking consistency is the key.\nWhen benchmarking your software whether it’s to be published as part of your marketing material or not, it needs to be consistent across technical specifications, not just “line” (MacBook Pro 13”).\n\nI am attempting to measure the performance of a common piece of software on the current line up of 13” and 16\" for the purpose of comparison between models.\n\nThe problem is technical configurations change significantly within that line.  My 2020 13” MacBook Pro may be vastly different than your 13” MacBook Pro.  Even if you choose to use a wide brush to describe the performance statistics, it may be “too wide a brush” because the CPU, GPU, and memory configurations can vary by such a wide degree.  Because of this saying “we get X operations on the 13” model and Y operations on the 16” model” won’t have much relevance because the natural question will be “which one of the 13” models did you test.”\nCritical & Non-Critical Factors\n\n*\n\n*CPU:  The CPU can vary from an i5 1.4GHz to an i9 2.3GHz.  Just that alone can affect your performance (and i7 2.3 and an i9 2.3 are very different in terms of speed.\n\n\n*Memory:  It’s not as critical as you’d like to think unless there’s memory pressure  because you’re maxing out.  For example generally, if you’re using a total of 4GB of RAM having 8 or 16GB total isn’t going to matter, but if you’re pushing 8GB and you’re comparing machines with 8 and 16GB, you will see a performance difference.\nHowever, from a marketing standpoint (what the customer reads), you want to remain consistent.  You don’t want them asking “why did you use 8 here and 16 there?”  You want to avoid giving the customer “cans of worms to open.”\n\n*\n\n*GPU:  Critical if your machine makes use of the GPU in some way - for graphics rendering or for number crunching.  However, like memory, you want to remain consistent here too as it’s also “a can of worms you don’t want them opening.”\n\n\n*Storage:  Not critical at all.  Whether you run this on a MacBook Pro with a 256GB SSD or a 512GB SSD it’s not going to make any difference - storage performance isn’t measured in size, but in IOPS or *Input/Output per Second.  So, unless your app depends on the speed of reading/writing to a drive, you can feel confident ignoring this factor.\n\n\n*Touch bar:  Yep!  The Touch bar.  While it does have it’s own “processor” to drive it, it still has to “sync up” with the rest of the OS and that requires CPU cycles (as few as they may be).  You don’t want something leeching CPU cycles from one test machine and not another; make sure your consistent on having one or not having one.\n\n\n*WiFi:  Generally not a concern especially if network connectivity is not an issue.  If your app doesn’t need it, turn it off for consistency.  This too, is like storage; unless critical, you can safely ignore it\n\n\n*Peripheral devices: mouse, keyboard, external drives, etc.  Most of these utilize very little in the way of CPU cycles, but again you don’t want a performance leech affecting your data.  However, if you must use one, like a USB-C to HDMI or Ethernet adapter, make sure you are using identical ones for each machine.  There’s no one USB bridge (interface between USB and the device) or even one SATA (for drives) or Ethernet (for network) controller.  Manufacturers are notorious for turning off features (even if the same chip is used) or using poor performing chips that require more CPU cycles to compensate.  If you must use one of these, make sure they are the same brand and model.\n\n\n*OS:  this is very critical.  You want a clean (meaning fresh install) with no 3rd party anything installed.  Safe mode is good in a pinch, but it doesn’t account for System Preferences customizations you may have made.  The OS needs to be the same down to the build number.\n\n\n*Environment.  Somewhat critical.  Ideally, you want to run in a “room temperature room” where the heat factors don’t change significantly (i.e. a room with lots of windows).  Unless you’re testing in the arctic or in a desert, any temperature controlled room is fine.\nTL;DR\nBenchmarking requires repeatable consistency.  However, you configure your devices, you must make every attempt to ensure a consistent test environment where you can perform multiple iterations of the benchmark without worry that your factors are inconsistent.\nThe worst case scenario is you get the guy who likes to play “stump the tech” in a public forum and your data is inconsistent.  And as mentioned earlier, you don’t want to give your customers “cans of worms” to open because, ultimately, you’ll be the one to clean them all up.\n", "Q: Folder name containing \"..\" on ExFAT: How to rename it?

I've looked into tools like keyboard masestro but was unable to do this.\n\nA: Consider using a visual scripting tool like Eggplant or SikuliX.\nSikuliX\nSikuliX is an open source scripting tool that detects images and performs actions:\n\nSikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix.

I would like to programmatically create a repeating event.  I'm using Automator and it seems that Automator can't do this, plus I want to pass variables provided by the user into the event creation process so I'm guessing I need to do it in AppleScript instead.  Trouble is I haven't been able to find information on how to do that.\nHow can I create a recurring event in Automator using AppleScript (or really any other way would be worthy of note as well)?\n\nA: I was unable to get all the way to my ultimate goal of creating repeating calendar events with open file alerts.  But, i did at least solve this question of how to create a repeating calendar event in AppleScript, so here it is.\nThe main issue is that you can't actually create a repeating event.  You have to create a static event, then modify that event to repeat.  Here's the code that is working for me:\n#Event name & description\nset title to \"event title\"\nset taskDescription to \"The Description\"\n\n# which dates to use?\nset startDate to date (\"07/21/2020\")\nset endDate to date (\"07/21/2020\") -- last date to include\n\n# which calendars contain the events?\nset thisCalendar to \"Automator\"\n\n# how many days in between repeats?\nset interval to 2\n\ntell application \"Calendar\"\n    tell calendar thisCalendar\n        make new event at end with properties {description:taskDescription, summary:title, start date:startDate + 540 * minutes, end date:startDate + 540 * minutes} # creates event at 9am, modify to suit.\n        set theEvents to (every event where its start date is equal to startDate + 540 * minutes)\n        set recurrence of item 1 of theEvents to \"FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=\" & interval\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nIf you don't have a local calendar called \"Automator\", then this might give you problems, I'm not sure.

that RN Diagnostics indicates you have conflicting country codes: some are US, some are RU (Russia). If your router transmits a different country code than what your macbook thinks it should be, then this can apparently cause problems with re-connecting. Check your router setup to see if the country code (or region) can be changed. Hopefully you have control over the affected routers to make this change.\n", "Q: How does giving Apple my CCV code confirm I am a parent of my child? I am setting up iCloud account for my child (just created a family). After setting nickname and entering my child's data, I am prompted for CCV code for my card, and it says:\n\"confirm you are the parent or legal guardian of this child by entering the security code for the card, Visa (**** 1234)\" - last 4 numbers are from my card.\nI can't understand - how does it confirming I am a parent?! And why is this even needed?\n\nA: It confirms you are owner of the card - or at least have it in your hand.\nPresumably, that is considered a minimum identity check, assuming the last names match. Sending in a photocopy birth certificate seems a bit 1980s these days ;)\nThe CARD Act of 2009 says that to have a credit card in one's name they must be 18 years old with a verifiable source of income or be 21 years of age.  Asking for the CCV of the card when setting up the child's account is just Apple's due diligence that the card associated with the parent's account is \"in hand of an adult\" and that the parent is aware the account is being created.\n", "Q: Dark mode not appearing as an option on ipad, how to make it appear? I wanted to use dark mode on my ipad.\nI tried the standard suggestion (based of this):\n\n*\n\n*Setting | Display & Control\nthen there should be a nice picture to toggle dark mode. The option is not there.\nI found a different option from this webpage to go to:\n\n*\n\n*Setting | Control Center | Customize Controls\nthen they claim there should be an option for dark mode, but it's not there.\nThus, I am unsure what to do. I've restarted the ipad and tried updating but the update option is not there.\nWhy is it not working?\n\nPerhaps some info of my ipad specs might help?\nSoftware Version: 12.4.6\nModel Name: iPad air\nModel Number: ME898LL/A\n\n\nA: iOS 12 doesn't have Dark Mode. It was new to iOS 13.\nYou can achieve something similar by going to\n\nSettings > General > Accessibility and choose Display Accommodations. Then click Invert Colours.\n\n\nIf you want to go all funhouse crazy, toggle the Classic Invert mode. But to get an inverted iOS that's closer to a true dark mode, you'll want to select Smart Invert.

I have two vertical monitors(ASUS VG249 1080p 144Hz)(BenQ GW2270 1080p 60Hz) and one normal monitor(DELL 2718Q 4k) set up with it, and they were working fine with a \"H-shape\" setup.\nHowever I just found after I updated to Big Sur for a week, the setting is failed. I am able to set only 1 monitor rotated. I tried to set the second rotation after the first rotation is successful, but the this operation would reset all the settings of Display, which means the three monitors are all horizontal.\nPlus, I've known it can also be a problem to Mac OS 10.15 or 10.14, I've searched it and found these problem unsolved.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I've solved this problem by making a safe mode reboot.\nYou need to shut down your MacbookPro, hold command + R. After you get into the safe mode successfully, restart it again.\nThis time you get into your Mac with a normal mode, and the dual rotation of monitors is working.\nA rough assumption is that a safe mode reboot may cleared some cache of the system?\nHope my solution can be helpful to you.\n", "Q: Removing Icloud Account from old phone I have just swapped from an Iphone 6s to an Iphone SE. I reset my old phone and and erased all contents and settings but I forgot to remove my icloud account. I've logged on to my icloud account and looked under 'my phone' but all i can see on there is my new phone. When I go into account settings I can see my old iphone 6s and there is an option to remove it from account. If I do this will that mean that my icloud had been removed? Thanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: Removing your iCloud account from the iPhone 6S from icloud.com or any other Apple device on Find My will mean that your iCloud account has been removed. Was Find My iPhone enabled on the iPhone 6S? If it was, then that means that the iCloud account was automatically removed when erasing the device (your device should have prompted for your Apple ID and Password). If you still have access to the iPhone 6S and want to make sure that it is removed completely, you should probably set up the phone again and use your Apple ID. Then, remove it from Settings > Your Name > Sign Out (at the bottom) and erase the device (Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings).\n", "Q: iMac locking immediately after remote connection via Anydesk or Chrome Remote I upgraded my iMac Late 2013 to Catalina.  When I login through Anydesk or Chrome Remote Desktop I see my desktop for a split second and then im presented with the lock screen again.\nWhile Anydesk is open, I can press 'switch user' in CRD which then shows me my screensaver.  Then if I start moving around the screen saver eventually quits and I can use my desktop in CRD, while anydesk still sees the switch user screen (the available users and the sleep/restart/shut down options)\nAfter a fresh reboot I was on with CRD & Anydesk.  I closed CRD, and I was back to the starting issue where the screen just locks and using CRD at same time I was able to login.  Sometime later I ended up with total lockout - neither Anydesk or CRD will connect even though I know the Mac is online running scripts.\nTwo remote connections, same iMac:\n\nI've also now put in Teamviewer and I have the same issue - as soon as I type my password it locks on me.  It sems like something is locking the cursor because with every letter I type the password field loses focus and I have to click again and quickly type the next letter.\nThese are the relevant options I can think of:\n\n*\n\n*Energy Saver: Turn display off after 10 min, prevent auto sleep when display off, put disks to sleep when possible, wake for network, auto start on power failure, enable power nap.\n\n*Screen Saver: Start after Never\n\n*Amphetamine: Launch at login, start session when launch or waking sleep, indefinite duration, allow display sleep, (no screen saver, no forced sleep).

Display sleep off\n4. duration: 12 hours or 24 hours (Indefinitely setting didn't work for me)\nAll other default energy saver settings were off.\n", "Q: How to force quit and restart a service every hour? The Underlying Problem\nThis is rather specific to my machine but basically, because of how my Mac, dock, & keyboard are connected, my keyboard software (Corsair iCUE) will occasionally freeze/hang until I go into activity manager and force quit it.\nIt happens once every day or 2 and the specific cause is not known, but it has never happened within a few hours of me restarting the service.\nAs a result, none of my macros, media keys, custom scripts, lighting effects, etc. work while iCue is frozen.\nThe Desired Workaround\nGiven how specific this issue is to my setup and that iCUE is in beta for Mac, I don't expect Corsair to fix it anytime soon.\nAlso, given that this issue never happens when I have recently restarted the service, my ideal workaround would be to simply force-restart it every hour or so. (It's a lightweight service, so restarting should be near-instant)\nMy Question: How can I force quit and then restart a service every hour?\nPlease let me know if I can provide any additional information to help!\n\nA: In Terminal, ps -ef to identify a search string for the process you want to kill.\nThen the script can find it by\nICPID=$(ps -ef | grep \"searchstring\" | awk '{print $2}') # find the PID\n\nkill -9 $ICPID                                           # kill it\n\n<full path to executable>                                # restart it\n\nThe 9 is the signal to send to the process.

I apologize for being somewhat lost, but I can't seem to turn up many obvious answers in a web search.\nI'm using iTerm2 and the fish shell, and after upgrading to Catalina, invoking the ps command seems to cause an unspecified bash process to proliferate which has an overwritten name and cannot be killed in the conventional way.\nAfter invoking ps several times I get the following output:\n  PID TTY           TIME CMD\n18710 ttys000    0:00.03 /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 --server login -fp username\n18712 ttys000    0:00.74 -fish\n18732 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18796 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18821 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18846 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18867 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18892 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18917 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18942 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18967 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n18992 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n19017 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n19042 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n19067 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n19092 ttys000    0:00.00 (bash)\n\nI'm assuming this has something to do with the move from bash to zsh as the native shell in Catalina, but I'm otherwise completely baffled. I don't know if anyone has a solution, but even a hint on how to diagnose it would be helpful.\n\nA: Okay, I think I found out the source of the problem. After removing the fasd plugin for the fish shell (https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-fasd) the issue seems to have gone away. Reinstalling it brings the problem back, so it must have been that. Absolutely no idea why it was doing this though.\n", "Q: Remote Management and Verizon I recently bought a MacBook Pro from a third party brand new in the box. I go to set it up and I get to a screen that says \"Remote Management\"\nIt says Verizon can remotely install apps and erase my MacBook Pro... WTF?\nWhy am I seeing this message? Does this mean the MacBook is not new?\n\n\n\nA: Very large organizations like Verizon likely have their devices enrolled from the factory, it could be new but it's likely stolen, innocently mixed up as a retail product for sale or liquidated to a 3rd party as \"new old stock\" (unlikely IMO).  However, generally speaking, when you see this screen, it's usually not “brand new in the box” as you describe.  The fact that it had MDM installed/enabled (manual process) means at a minimum, it was configured for use.  The moment that happens, it’s no longer \"new\" but \"used\" (pre-owned) or at the very least it's considered \"Open Box.\"\nThe problem here is that you could have something that is legitimately sold from Verizon to the third party via liquidation and the MDM was innocently overlooked to it being a stolen device in which case, if you are in possession of it, you could have it confiscated by authorities without compensation back to you.\nIn this particular case, Verizon being a large company with a large bureaucracy, it will be a Herculean effort to validate its legitimacy  and to get MDM removed.  I would return this to the person you purchased this from for a full refund as it’s not as described - brand new. Let the vendor deal with removing the MDM - this is the \"value add\" he's supposed to provide.\nThis is not to say that buying from 3rd parties is to be discouraged; you just have to be more diligent. Here are some tips for dealing with 3rd parties:\n\n*\n\n*Use a service that offers purchase protection like PayPal or eBay\n\n\n*Test it out; boot it up and test before closing the deal. If you run into this type of error, walk away.\n\n\n*Boot it from a completely off state.  If the machine is running and “waiting” for you, it could be a sign of trying to obfuscate issues. Shut it down completely and boot from off. For instance, they may have booted into Safe Mode, obscuring any issue that might occur during a normal boot\n\n\n*Test everything while on battery.\n\n*\n\n*There are keyboard test sites (https://www.keyboardtester.com/)  or you can use Karabiner Elements (it has an event viewer) this will help you ensure the keyboard is good (You can also try xev but it requires XQuartz to be installed (both are free)\n\n*Memtest86 is free and you can boot it off a USB drive\n\n*DriveDx is free for diagnostics (pay for data recovery) and is an excellent tool to test out the storage\n\n\n\n*Check the battery stats.  You can do this from Terminal without extra software.  Issue the command:\nsystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep -i \"charge information\" -A 10\n\nSee the link for sample output.  If it's brand new it won't have a bunch of cycles (should be in the single digits) and the \"max charge\" and \"charge remaining\" shouldn't have much of a delta if the battery's fully charged.\n\n*\n\n*(I can't stress this enough) If this is an in-person transaction, do this at a police station.  Some even offer a well lit, camera monitored space in the the front parking lot to do the exchange.  If your seller balks at this, you'll know something's not right and should walk from the deal.\n\nConclusion\nMost of all, live by the philosophy caveat emptor or buyer beware. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you not \"strong\" in tech, do what you'd do if buying a used car from a 3rd party - bring along a tech to give you the thumbs up/down on the purchase.\n\nA: Apple has device enrollment so you can get this with a brand new - out of the box Mac or iPhone or iPad. It could be a simple mistake where the person selling a Mac accidentally listed your serial number instead of the correct one, or they pulled the wrong mac from stock for you. It could also be deliberate bait and switch or worse.\nActual mistakes where Apple or their agents mess up serials and DEP is super rare, and most of the time, this indicates a company purchased this through educational / enterprise / business team and your seller is the one that messed up intentionally or unintentionally.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204142\nI would get them to retrieve the original purchase and contact Apple to validate the serial number and double check they didn’t accidentally register your new Mac to the wrong account.\nSince this is third party - have them release the DEP lock in less than a week or return it. You can’t escape this and without the original invoice - not your third party invoice, Apple will decline to unlock that Mac and release it in my experience. You might also consult a local lawyer to learn what your obligations are with respect to suspected stolen goods, you may have purchased an experience here and not a product you can use.\n", "Q: can I restore my SMS messages without iCloud?

In this example output, 1 snapshot was removed:\nThinned local snapshots:\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-07-17-200440\n\n", "Q: How does iOS and apps deal with low to no disk storage? I was trying to determine why all apps were crashing on a phone when I looked at the storage and saw it was completely at-capacity. I tried restarting and exiting all background tasks to no avail. The entire 32GB of storage was shown as being used, and as soon as we deleted an app that took up a sizeable chunk of disk, everything started working again. And many people have the same issue.\nThis, however, goes against my intuition as to memory management coming from a computer science background — iOS does not swap pages to the disk, so we wouldn't need to reserve space on disk for this. In addition, it's not an issue with RAM as exiting all running background apps didn't change anything, nor did restarting the phone.\nI understand that the kernel would kill processes if it were an affair with RAM contention and resident pages in RAM getting too high, but that's not the case here. So my question is then, if there is no swapping to disk, and it's not a RAM affair, what is the most likely cause for apps to all completely crash like this without even starting up? I'm assuming they're not all trying to write to disk on startup...\n\nA: This is a design decision that is made to handle situations where operators of the device choose to ignore low storage space warnings or are not present to see them and react appropriately.\nFrom your comments, you described that the system works well enough to let you inspect storage, choose to delete apps and data and continue working - that’s the case in my experience. The system sacrifices the ability to launch new apps, install updates and do other non-critical functions when storage space is close to empty.\nIn most cases, the system is able to send a sequence of disk space “warning” and disk space “critical” signals to the OS, the first party apps and third party apps requesting they purge any cached storage, but in the end, you can overload the filesystem and this is the last ditch attempt to get the device in the hands of someone that will realize that files or apps need to be deleted to resume normal operations.\nFor the nerds that program, there are entire API and processes around this to let an app know how much space is available for opportunistic storage and critical storage:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlvolumeavailablecapacityforimportantusagekey\nOne of the better articles on this is:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlresourcekey/checking_volume_storage_capacity\nIn the end, it’s up to the programmer of an app if they want to check and let you know they may stop working or if they want to be simple in design and let you figure out if your device is full in other manners. Neither decisions is completely right or completely wrong. The OS will nag you about low storage, so most apps let that handle education these days and they just postpone large downloads when things get tight.\n", "Q: Im trying to use xcrun altool to get my app notarised, what is --asc-provider parameter?

All other parameters I have found and fine. Help me out I'm new to mac.\n\nA: altool manual page\nThe manual for altool can be viewed by running the command man altool. The manual states:\n\n--asc-provider provider_shortname\nRequired with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple providers.\n\nWithout your knowing, it is unlikely that your account is associated with multiple providers.\nasc-provider\nIf you believe you need a provider, see Apple's Customizing the Notarization Workflow:\n\nYou can omit the asc-provider option for the notarization call if your credentials are associated with only a single team. Otherwise, use the option to indicate the provider short name for the appropriate team. Starting in Xcode 11, you can use altool to get a table of providers, provider short names, and team IDs associated with a given username and password using the list-providers option:\nxcrun altool --list-providers -u \"AC_USERNAME\" -p \"@keychain:AC_PASSWORD\"\n\n\n\nA: The provider is nothing but the membership account that you use.

I recently did a clean install of macOS Catalina. I did this knowing well that my previous OS, Mojave was backed up on Time Machine. However, am failing to restore the Time machine backup on the new Catalina OS.\n\nA: Time Machine doesn’t operate differently when restoring.\n\n*\n\n*If you restore a backup interval made on an older or same OS - it works.\n\n*If you attempt to restore a backup interval made from a newer OS than what is attempting the restore it will fail.\n\nSince we don’t know what’s failing - you can either attach the Time Machine and indicate before you create the first user account you want to migrate. If you are past that, erase the Mac and then watch carefully in the setup steps where you are asked to choose to restore from backup.\nIf you don’t want to erase Catalina - open Migration Assistant and choose the data you want to restore from your Time Machine.\nIf you like steps and guides - here is a great one on moving your data to a new Mac.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350\n", "Q: Best Practice for User Shell Scripts location and/or PATH I am interested in knowing if there is a best practice for placing/storing custom shell (Bash/Zsh) scripts and it's related PATH location.\nI know folks have their favorite places - I usually dumped mine in /opt/local/bin but that required root permissions (sudo) and it was \"intermixed\" with all the stuff from MacPorts; thus it was unorganized to say the least.  So, this is not what I'm looking for - an opinion of what each individual liked best.\nIs there a generally accepted recommendation of a location/methodology to store custom scripts both system wide (all users) for individual users' own personal scripts (maybe in their home directory?) and if necessary (and available), how to structure the PATH?\n\nA: Put things in /usr/local is the best practice for global use\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/98626/5472\nYour individual user needing a separate playground / path / space is more tricky to solve.\n\n*\n\n*How many users?\n\n*Where do they come from in terms of access / authentication?\n\nBest practice (a.k.a workable and optimal) is not the same for three people that ssh in to a machine or you have thousands of students, faculty that leverage a mature file sharing / network home folder architecture or you all are developers and will check your code into source control and access many machines and want to sync things.\nThere’s likely no best practice than knowing your users, their skill level and preferred tools and working with your support budget. Things a professional IT team / dev team will engineer, provide and support will be far more powerful than a couple people sharing a Mac mini at the office. Those same tools are overkill for a small group or one person setting up several accounts.\nDepending on your volume of items subdirectories in the local user folder can be very helpful. The only other suggestion I’ve seen that’s worth considering is /Library or ~/Library but those are further from the unix/shell heritage for my tastes.\n", "Q: Mac pausing bluetooth headset used by another device I try to use my bluetooth headset (Jabra Elite Active 75t) with both my Macbook (MacOS 10.15.5 19F101) and my Android phone. If I pause all the sounds on Mac and try to play any music on the phone, the reproduction will stop immediately as if pause signal is sent.\nThis can also be reproduced with another bluetooth speaker.\nAny idea how can I work around the bug?\n\nA: Any sound your computer makes  whether a system sound (i.e. an alert) or something from media will cause the media to stop playing on your other device.  What you have to do is temporarily disconnect from the device you're not listening to.  In macOS, just click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, select your audio device and select Disconnect.\n\nIt's only temporary and you and reconnect any time by going to the same menu and clicking Connect.\nThis happens to me all the time on my iPad and iPhone.  It's not really a bug, but a limitation.  The computer/iPad/iPhone isn't stopping the music, it's the headphone - it's assuming that the \"new\" sound coming from the device is what should have priority so it sends a pause signal (like you hit the button on the headset manually) to the app playing the music/video/whatever.\nI also suggest having all system sounds play through the internal speakers and not the audio device you listen to for videos, music, etc.\n\nI got this information from Sennheiser  support because any small noise my iPhone made would pause the music or podcast I was listening to on my iPad.\n", "Q: How to mute accessibility options voice over? Sometimes when I double click the power button, I hear a voiceover for accessibility options.\nHow do I disable this and all other potential voiceovers?\n\nA: A triple-click on the power button will show the accessibility shortcuts window. In macOS Catalina, you can disable this in System Preferences → Accessibility → Shortcut (at the bottom of the sidebar list) by disabling all the checkboxes in the list. Prior to macOS Catalina it is not possible to disable this action.\n\nA: I think everyone is misunderstanding the op. She's not asking about the VoiceOver Accessibility feature, she is asking about the voice over that plays unsolicited when you trigger Accessibility Options by triple clicking the power button. It plays even when you already have VoiceOver turned off. I use triple power to enable/disable colour filters so it's pretty annoying when I'm somewhere quiet (library) and my computer starts speaking.\nI figured out a workaround to completely get rid of these types of voice overs:\nSystem Settings > Accessibility > Vision > Spoken Content > Speaking volume\nSet the slider to the lowest setting. This effectively mutes any spoken content that plays independently of VoiceOver and still allows VoiceOver to work when you turn it on.\n", "Q: iCloud photo mismatch, debug options?

In the end my wife thought of a way to resolve this.\n\n*\n\n*On the Mac (which has 7201 photos), divide this into two albums, one with 3600, and the other with 3601 Album-A and Album-B.\n\n\n*On iCloud check which album isn't matching, i.e. Album-A had 3601 on my Mac, but in iCloud it showed only 3600.\nRepeat this process dividing the photo set in two continuously.\nIt took about 30 mins, but eventually I had narrowed it down to a set of photos with say 36 images. I then manually found the offending photo.\nSo, weirdly, it was a photo that literally didn't appear in iCloud photos. Yet when re-syncing from iCloud it would come down to a blank device. Weird.\nAnyway, on my devices this innocuous photo, had a little cloud icon in the corner. again weird, not other photos had this.\nI deleted it manually from both devices.\nSince then all devices are in sync with the cloud, and re-syncs are working.\nSo there you go, strange.\n", "Q: Miniaturise all windows with AppleScript tell application \"System Events\"\n    set mywindows to windows of (processes where background only is false)\n    repeat with theItem in windows of (processes where background only is false)\n        set miniaturized of theItem to true\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI get\nerror \"System Events got an error: Can’t set miniaturized of UI element to any.\" number -10006 from miniaturized of UI element to any\n\nA: I answered a similar question over on Stack Overflow, around the time I was still working mostly in High Sierra.  Testing it today, it still works on Catalina.\nHere's the salient part of that answer:\ntell application id \"com.apple.systemevents\" to set the value of ¬\n        attribute \"AXMinimized\" of every window of every process ¬\n        to true\n\nUnfortunately, it's not going to minimise them all simultaneously, which would be lovely.  It does them one-by-one, not necessary starting with the one that's right in front of you.  Therefore, if you have many windows open, it can appear at first that it's not doing anything, but in fact it's minimising windows obscured by the frontmost one), and they'll minimise in turn, which is fun to see the first time, but irksome every other time when you just want it done now.\nAnother point that @user3439894 kindly reminded me of is that System Events is only aware of objects that exist on the currently active desktop.  Therefore, this method won't be to minimise windows that are on other desktops/spaces are off-screen.\nHowever, if you aren't specifically looking to minimise windows, but rather just get them out of sight, then you can elect to hide the processes instead:\ntell application id \"com.apple.systemevents\" to ¬\n        set visible of every process to false\n\nThe major annoyance here is that Finder remains visible, and will need to have an extra line of code after to get rid of its windows, which I suggest should be:\ntell application id \"com.apple.Finder\" to set ¬\n        miniaturized of every window to true\n\nThe benefits, however, are that all the windows across all desktops/screens will be gone, not just the ones on your current desktop; and this takes place very quickly, almost instantaneously (apart from Finder).  Activating the application by clicking on its dock icon for example, makes the process visible again; typically, this means that the application and all of its windows that were previously visible will re-appear en masse.  Whether that's a positive or negative will depend on your needs.\n\nThe reason your code doesn't work is because miniaturised is not a property of the window object belonging to the processes suite of System Events' AppleScript dictionary.  It is a property of window objects belonging to the standard suite of any scriptable application's AppleScript dictionary (including SystemEvents, although it doesn't have any windows of its own); despite sharing a common name, these two window class objects are distinct and unrelated objects in AppleScript.\n", "Q: Show Keynote presenter view but share only slides via Zoom? Back when I was in the office, I'd connect my MacBook Pro to a conference room's large display via HDMI cable and, using Keynote, show only the slides on the large display, but the presenter view (with notes) on the laptop display.\nNow that I'm working from home, I have only the laptop display, but, when I give a talk via Zoom, I want the same thing, i.e., share only the slides, but see the presenter view on the laptop display.\nIs this possible?  If so, how?\n\nA: The easiest way is to buy a dummy plug that acts as a tiny (but high resolution) external screen. And then you share your slides as usual.

I have tried everything with no avail short of restoring the phone from scratch and starting over.

You'll also have to login again to some apps, but others you won't.\nIt also takes a long time, and is generally a pain.  But, given that this problem is all over the internet including on apple forums with no response or help from the company (typical), I will depend on this in the future too!\n\nA: Settings → iPhone Storage\nDelete any apps you never use.  Then at the bottom, \"On My iPhone,\" look at the local files for app you do use and delete files you don't need.\nAlternatively, in Finder on MacOS, plug in and select the iPhone.  Go to the apps tab and look through the files different apps have stored.

In either case, you need a backup for both.\n\n*\n\n*Erase all content and settings\n\n*Restore the OS\n\nIf the first method works, you have some containers where the indexer can’t adequately report user data correctly.\nIf Wiping the user data / user sandbox clears this in less than 20% of the cases I see, but it’s quicker.\nIf the second method works, the container itself needed to be erased.\nThe APFS filesystem is in play, so without a command line interface or custom app that likely calls private API (or a jailbreak) we can’t really know if it’s APFS snapshots or just files that are in some state that a restore is the correct way to reset and clean.\n", "Q: Apple TV+ (the subscription) - how can I tell what it actually offers?

This one seems to be on the level and actually part of the channel, but nothing really differentiates it from Game of Thrones, except for a small icon bottom right.\nAnd so on.  How do I see what a subscription actually buys me?  And how, when I search, do I avoid extra-fee listings like Sicario?\n\nA: The easiest way I browse TV+ content is by opening the TV app on iPad and look for the channels. Tap on it, then you can see all the major shows. Also, on each show in the app, look for the service in the text as well as the badging in the lower right corner.\n\nOf course the free episodes can and will change, so I wouldn’t count on things that are free today being so in a month or vice-versa. If you prefer web access: https://tv.apple.com lets you browse and watch off device (AppleTV, iPhone, iPad, etc..) in a native app.\nSince the native apps show all channels, not everything is included nor is everything in the app advertisement free, however what you pay for from the + is commercial free, downloadable, playable for the duration of the subscription whether it’s subsidized or paid in cash / store credit.\n", "Q: Max length a USB-C charge cable can be for a Mac Mini 2018?

It was perfectly functional but the seller hadn’t removed any of their personal info before selling it so my wife erased it (I believe it was a factory reset that she did). The computer now only boots in recovery mode, and we are unable to reinstall the operating system because it’s requiring the password of the person that sold it to us. We’ve tried contacting them for either a password or even proof of purchase to bring it to Apple, but they will not reply.\nSo currently we are trying to reinstall the macOS from a bootable thumb drive. I succeeded in making the drive from another computer, but that’s only lead me to more hiccups. For one, I can’t get the computer to start up in the boot menu. No matter what keys I hold down at it opens in recovery mode.\nI thought I figured out how to work with this when I went into the operating system installer and saw my thumb drive as an option, but when I click on it, it says the disk is locked. So I’ve been trying to figure out how to unlock it, including the verify and repair, but when I clock repair it says it cannot be done.\nSo help with any of this would be greatly appreciated. Either getting to the boot menu, unlocking the disk, or even better if there is some other easy solution to getting around the issue with the password to get macOS up and running!\n\nA: I solved the problem! I looked up how to erase a computer when you plan to sell it, was able to do so in recovery mode by opening up the disk utility and selecting erase on the hard drive and setting it to the maximum security. This successfully removed the need for the previous owners password and was able to reinstall macOS as per normal from there!\n", "Q: Difference in archive formats? After a little testing, I can't figure out what the difference is in the archive formats listed in the Preferences > Use archive format. Each time I compress a folder, each one has the same extension and file size.

To use the other options you have to open Archive Utility directly and drag-and-drop things onto the icon in the Dock.\n", "Q: iPhone screenshots have wrong date info on PC I recently exported several screenshots from my iPhone SE onto my Windows 10 PC. I noticed some photos, but specially the screenshots, have a wrong value for the date taken and the date created.\nThe images on the phone have the correct date before exporting them.  They are only incorrect after transferring to the computer.\nThere does not seem to be a constant factor by which the date is off.  Sometimes, only the time is wrong and others both the date and the time are wrong.\nFor what is worth, the screenshots have a PNG extension while photos have a JPG extension and I have already check that the system clock of both my PC and my phone are set correctly.\nIs there anyway to get these to offload with the correct times?\n\nA: I'll start by saying that the file extension itself has nothing to do with the time metadata alterations for your photos.\nNow to address the problem at hand: it depends on how you exported your photos. If you copied the files over to your PC using Windows Explorer (which I suspect you did) then Windows will not reliably preserve the original time/date metadata of your photos. As you mentioned yourself, Windows isn't even consistent in the fashion in which it alters the time metadata. If you're copying just one file, the metadata should be correct. Other times, if you're doing a bulk copy, not only will Windows sometimes change the time metadata for certain files, but it'll also change the filename for certain files. Why this happens, I don't know.\nI haven't used iTunes in a while (I use iMazing instead to manage my iPhone – you should check it out if you're interested in an alternative to iTunes) but I do believe that if you import your photos and videos via iTunes, then all your files' metadata will be correctly preserved and handled.\n\nYou can also try uploading the screenshots to a cloud service (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.) and then downloading them onto your computer. There shouldn't be any reason for the upload process to alter any of the files' time metadata.\n", "Q: Does \" would like to access files in your Downloads folder\" give complete access to directory, or just certain files in it? I see the following (particularly with communications apps like slack and zoom):\n\nIf I had sensitive info in Downloads, say, client data for a project I'd been working on, could these applications like Zoom or Slack upload that file to their servers (or access it in any other way), or does this permission only give these applications the ability to do the following\n\n*\n\n*save files sent through that application\n\n*upload files sent by the user through the application (for example, if I wanted to send a file from Downloads to a friend)\n\nThe notification as it stands doesn't rule out the possibility that the application will be given permission to upload anything it wants from Downloads to its servers at any time it wants. I would assume it doesn't have that permission, but we know what happens when we assume..\n\nA: No: the permission is for unlimited access to that folder.\nThere's nothing to stop an app secretly uploading all your files to some server, except that people would notice and denounce the company, and there's no commercial benefit in doing it anyway.\nThe Documents folder is another location that has  privileged access, but the trouble is that every app that can open and save files is likely to need access to it. If you create another user folder outside Documents, then it will be open to all user processes.\nYou can install something like Little Snitch, which will regularly worry you with information about all outgoing internet connections, and let you allow/deny them.\n", "Q: How do I change my iCloud password when it’s stolen?

And which is correct?\n\nA: The %CPU column is percentage of one [virtual] core. The total summary is percentage of entire CPU. So if, for instance you have 4 real cores, 8 virtual, the maximum possible total figure in the %CPU column would be 800%\nif you want to check how many cores you have, Use either Window menu > CPU usage or CPU history.

I am trying to make a virtual machine using VirtualBox. I have been following the comment David Anderson made for me here on this post (his comment I am talking about is at the bottom): Install macOS Sierra on VirtualBox?\nI have gotten to his step #3 and finished it. I am now at step 4, but I haven't started step 4.\nBefore I finished this process I thought it might be a good idea to make a time machine backup of my drive in case I do anything wrong, also I haven't made a backup in about 150 days.\nI'm just wondering if making a Time Machine backup with a sparse disk image containing a bootable installer will be a problem for the Time machine backup?\nThese are my computer specs in case they are needed for reference:\nMacbook Pro mid-2014,\nRunning macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (natively)\n\nA: I would absolutely encourage you to stop and make a Time Machine backup. There’s no harm in trying to manually twiddle things, but wouldn’t it be better to make your first backup in 150 days to an actual drive that’s connected?\nYou won’t run into issues with installers being downloaded - those are just are large files that get saved one time and then don’t change in the next hour’s backup.\n\nA: At best, Time Machine will preserve the \"sparseness\" of the \"sparse disk image containing a bootable installer\" (saving space).  Otherwise, Time Machine will \"fill out\" the backup to the maximum size of the sparse file.  Which Time Machine does may depend on whether the backup is local or remote (and possibly other factors).  In either case, Time Machine should do its job and backup the file.\nHowever, there are some restrictions on what Time Machine excludes which may affect your Time Machine backup (so YMMV):\nhttps://www.baligu.com/pondini/TM/11.html\nFor example, if you have excluded your home folder/desktop where the file is located, it will be excluded.\n", "Q: Can't Interact with Second External Monitor I have connected two external monitors to my MacBook Pro through USB-C to an Anker docking station.  The displays appear to be arranged correctly in the settings (screenshot below)\nIn the image, Monitor 1 is my Macbook Pro.  Monitors 2 and 3 are external through the docking station.\nThe problem is, for some reason monitors 2 and 3 are 'mirrored' in the sense that their displays are identical.  However, I can drag my mouse from 2 to 3 as though they were extended.  I cannot actually interact with monitor 3 using the mouse however.\nAny pointers to fix this bizarre behavior would be appreciated!  Thanks for looking\n\n\nA: You could try using the program I wrote, displayplacer, which was developed to deal with the wonkiness of macOS screen layouts. For your particular situation, you'll want to run displayplcer list to output your current monitor setup. Then, edit that profile so that it isn't mirroring. Mirrored monitors are after the + sign in the id section. It'll take a bit of fiddling. Once you get it working though, you can assign that displayplacer command to a hotkey. Then, whenever this happens again (usually every time you plug in), type the hotkey to set your monitors to the correct layout.\n\nA: The solution in my case was to use a monitor from a different model/manufacturer for display #3.  When monitors 2 and 3 were identical in make and model, the bizarre pseudo mirroring would happen.  When I changed out #3 to a different make/model everything worked normally.\nAlso check out Jake Hilborn's answer for displayplacer on github if using a different monitor is not an option\n", "Q: How to show Cmd+ to the **tab** title? \nI was watching a video and this guy managed to add Cmd+number to the tabs title - instead of the window title that only shows the current selected tab - how?\n\nA: In term2, the default is to show the command and number.

My current plan is to shrink the Windows 10 partition, connect the broken MBP to the other MBP in target disk mode, use asr to copy the macOS partition over, and I should be able to boot of the other MBP. Would this plan work? Will asr copy blocks that have information on them (fs/meta/data) or will it conduct a block-to-block copy, including free blocks? I want to minimize read as the SSD have a limited lifespan.\n\nA: I end up copying the system over using the \"Restore\" function of Disk Utility, by connecting the serviced mac in Target Disk Mode to the other mac and restoring the macOS APFS container over to the Windows partition. This process is slower (300 MB/s) then the theoretical speed (1 GB/s) and it took twice as much time as I expect because there is a verification stage after the copying stage.\nAfter copying the system, I successfully booted into my copied system on the other mac with no weird or unusual symptoms.

They can do what they like, because every system they interface with will think it is you.\n\nA: In general, this will be difficult on the phone itself since you’re trying to forensically reconstruct past events from log files that expire routinely. The easiest thing would be to take your phone to each computer you suspect and see if there’s a pairing record or backup stored on the filesystem.\nEach phone makes it’s own folder, so you might see two phones backed up to a computer you only expected one.\nA pairing and backup surely leave log messages on iOS, but since you can’t easily inspect those, you would need Xcode to open the console and read the log files from the phone.\n", "Q: PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR on 2 of my 3 WordPress sites but only from my MacBook Pro I get the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR error on two of my three WordPress sites when using current versions of Firefox and Safari on my late 2013 MacBook Pro, macOS 10.15.6. All three sites are hosted on the same ionos.com plan (shared Linux server). I can access the sites from this computer when using Edge (Chromium) and Tor browsers. I can also access them with any browser from my iPhone, iPad, and my wife's late-2013 MacBook Pro with the same macOS and browsers.\nWhen I uninstalled Sophos Home Premium, as attrib suggested, the issue went away. Unfortunately, attrib's solution did not work for me. When I reinstalled Sophos the issue returned.\nI also use a Winston Privacy appliance but it filters traffic for our whole home network and should affect all of our devices in the same ways. To be sure, I bypassed Winston and had the same issue.\nI let Little Snitch run in passive mode. It did not record any blocked connections to the affected sites. I've also asked friends to visit the sites and they had no issues.\nAll of this seems to point to some issue on my MacBook Pro but I have been unable to find relevant guidance I can follow to get to the bottom of it.\nI am not an under-the-hood expert on macOS or networks but I usually can follow explicit, step-by-step instructions.\n\nA: I would use the developer console in your browsers to start to look at the web site errors. That almost always shows you the error in these cases, however if there are lots of errors, you may spend some time eliminating them one by one.\nHere are step by step directions to get the console on Safari.

I purchased this system in January, 2016. It says it is a \"Late 2015\" model. Apple Care told me it is the last generation compatible with non-matching RAM chip amounts so I left the Apple provided 8gb RAM (two 4gb sticks) in when I added 2 8GB sticks of Crucial RAM that is the EXACT recommended RAM specs! I even checked with Apple Care to be sure. \"About this Mac\" says \"24 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\" for \"Memory\". Anybody have an idea why it's momentarily \"beach balling\" MORE OFTEN now after adding the RAM?\nPrior to adding the ram it was \"beach balling\" HARD if I ran memory greedy apps like Civ 6 Mac edition so I was forced to hold down the power button then but it ran fine the rest of the time.\nTo answer the drive type question in the comment, I bought the system with a 1tb non-Fusion HDD as that was the only drive I could afford.

I did some research and according to EveryMac.com your iMac has both an SSD and a regular HDD.  One or both could be dying.  Most of my drives lasted around 5 years and that one is 5 years old now.\nI found this post:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/239723/377857 on how to fix it, but it seems like you have to remove the glass.  I did a little more research (I want to do this to my iMac) and it seems like you have to cut the glue holding the screen.  That scares me.\nSince it is so difficult to do, I would probably use a program like Disk Warrior or Disk Drill (see them recommended by people all over this site) to test out the drive first.  If it's not failing, why go through the trouble of opening it up?\nIf you do have to change it, it might be a good idea to get a pro to do this job.  Maybe if I get more experience, I will try it myself, but not yet.\nPS - In my experience, I've found that using matching RAM modules is the way to go.\n", "Q: How do I compile Apple's Security framework? I am trying to compile my own copy of Apple's Security.framework, specifically version 55471.14.18, which was included in OS X 10.9.5 and whose source code can be downloaded from https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/Security/Security-55471.14.18.tar.gz.\nI'm using a copy of Mac OS X 10.9.5 in a VM. Xcode 6.2 has been installed, and xcode-select --install has separately been run to acquire system headers.\n\nThe readme file included in the source download says:\n\nTo build this project in a Darwin environment (as opposed to building\nin-house at Apple), use the Darwin buildstyle. If you're building with\nXcode, select \"Darwin\" from the \"Active Build Style\" popup. If you're\nbuilding from the command line, specify the build style like so:\n% xcodebuild -buildstyle Darwin install\n\nBut when I run the given command, I'm told:\nxcodebuild: error: option '-buildstyle' is no longer supported\nSince my copy of Xcode was current at the time this code was released, I'm not sure what to make of this error. I decided to ignore it and press on with just a standard xcodebuild command.\n\nThe first problem I ran into was easy to fix, but makes me worried I'm missing something larger. The compiler complains:\n/Users/Jonathan/Desktop/Security-55471.14.18/libsecurity_utilities/lib/macho++.cpp:39:18: error: \nunused variable 'MAX_ARCH_COUNT' [-Werror,-Wunused-const-variable]\nstatic const int MAX_ARCH_COUNT = 100;\n\nSince the variable is reportedly unused anyway, I just opened the file and commented out the line static const int MAX_ARCH_COUNT = 100;.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where I ran into a brick wall. Xcodebuild seems to want all sorts of headers that are not on my system or included in the project. For instance:\n/Users/Jonathan/Desktop/Security-55471.14.18/libsecurity_utilities/lib/mach++.cpp:33:10: fatal error: \n      'bootstrap_priv.h' file not found\n#include <bootstrap_priv.h>\n\nThese headers are also open source, and I know where to find them! Bootstrap_priv.h, for example, is part of launchd; the OS X 10.9.5 version can be downloaded from https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/launchd/launchd-842.92.1.tar.gz\nHowever, I do not understand where I'm supposed to put these headers in order for the compiler to find them! Things I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Copying the launchd project to /usr/include/\n\n*Copying the launchd project to the root of the security project\n\n*Copying just Bootstrap_priv.h to /usr/include/\n\n*Copying just bootstrap_priv.h to the root of the security project\n\n*Copying just bootstrap_priv.h to the project directory/libsecurity_utilities/lib/\n\nThat last attempt actually did let me get past the error (and to see the next missing header, IOPMLibPrivate.h), but I'm quite sure it's not what I'm supposed to do! As I keep adding headers to random places within the project, other source files get stuck finding headers I've already copied elsewhere. Some of the headers themselves get stuck this way, expecting a different relative path for dependencies than what the main project seems to need.\n\nI am feeling extremely out of my depth here! Where are these header files actually supposed to go, and what is the meaning of that -buildstyle option I'm supposed to include but which can't be run? None of this appears to be documented anywhere!\n\nA: This ended up being a lot more complicated than I think rightly fits this site's Q&A format. Even so, I didn't want to leave this question hanging, since I did get the framework to build, kindda.\nThis repository should build fully in 10.9.5 running the latest compatible version of xCode, and using the 10.9 SDK. https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/Wowfunhappy-Mavericks-Security-Framework\nI used the \"User Framework Search Paths\" to add libraries, but because it's an absolute rather than a relative path, you may need to update it on your machine. This should be trivial even if it is a bit tedious—all of the actual frameworks are included in the Git repository. These Frameworks come from a combination of opensource.apple.com (preferred wherever available for obvious reasons), samdmarshall's reverse-engineered private SDK, and the Darling project.\nThe built Framework does not appear to actually function—replacing it on my hard drive makes the computer (a VM, thankfully) unable to boot. I initially expected this to be a code signing issue, but it doesn't look like that's the problem. But, still, it built!\ntl;dr I wasn't making some stupid oversight, Apple's opensource releases are basically impossible to actually build without additional reverse engineering. Luckily, that reverse engineering work has largely been done by various projects, but seemingly not to the point where you can build something that actually works.\n", "Q: Can AppleScript create an Open File Alert? macOS Mojave 10.14.6\nI would like to be able to programmatically create repeating calendar events that open a given file when run.  I'm using AppleScript within Automator.  Creating the repeating events is not hard, but I cannot seem to add an Open File Alert.  Is this possible?\nI found this old post which was having the same problem and the nearest conclusion was that it's not possible for some inexplicable reason.  Does anyone know how to accomplish this?\n\nA: Quoting Calendar's AppleScript dictionary in macOS Catalina (but applicable since Mojave) :\n\n\"This class represents an 'open file' alarm. Starting with OS X 10.14, it is not possible to create new open file alarms or view URLs for existing open file alarms. Trying to save or modify an open file alarm will result in a save error. Editing other aspects of events or reminders that have existing open file alarms is allowed as long as the alarm isn't modified.\"\n\nAdditionally, having tested other types of calendar alarms in Catalina that do not have similar warnings against them, they too failed to be created.  Whilst the restriction in place for file alarms is most likely motivated by security concerns, the others feel more like a bug.\n", "Q: Linking MacBook Pro and iMac as single system As I’ve moved to working from home during quarantine I’ve found myself in a bit of a situation which I’m hoping you can help me out with. Traditionally I have one workstation (a MBP connected to an external monitor) for video editing, and an iMac for video editing. However I’m hoping to link all 3 of them to make a single workstation like the picture I just took: where I am using the iMac as the base of the system (for its performance) and the MBP and secondary monitor as additional external monitors while being able to use the keyboard and trackpad from the MBP as it’s what I’m most comfortable with.\nIs there any way that I might be able to do this?\n\n\nA: You could potentially solve this with a product called Barrier and with display sharing software\nNote: this is a total bodge and not something I would personally do because you’re likely to spend more time fiddling with it than getting actual work done.\nBarrier will let you use your keyboard and mouse on several computers.  Its like a software KVM that works on a client/server model.  All the computers must be on the same network and ideally, you’d use the MacBook keyboard and trackpad to control the iMac.  The external display would be connected to the iMac for simplicity.  To use the MacBook screen, you would need something like Luna Display to extend the display of the iMac to the MBP.\nThere’s a YouTube video on how Barrier works.  You can also see a demo of Luna Display on Youtube.\n\nA: Upgrade to macOS Monterey 12.4 and enable Universal Control.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757\nThis has been requested for a decade or more and it’s wonderful to see it working now.\n", "Q: Do the Airpods Pro change how your internal voice sounds? This is just a question for owners of Airpods Pro. I've noticed that with regular earbuds that seal with a foam or soft plastic tip, the seal makes your internal voice sound weird. This is very jarring and makes speaking normally very difficult. This makes earbuds very uncomfortable to use for meetings/phone calls.\nApple's regular wired earbuds don't have a perfect seal, and talking with them in doesn't change the way my voice sounds to myself. This is good, but the earbuds also don't fit well in my ears and keep falling out.\nI can't find anyone talking about this online, possibly because I don't know what terms to search for. I'm wondering if anyone with Airpods Pro can let me know:\n\n*\n\n*Are you familiar with this problem? It's possible that not everyone experiences this.\n\n*Do the Airpods Pro have this problem, where your voice sounds different to yourself? Does this change if you use Transparency mode?\n\n\nA: No they do not - not due to plugging your ears and not due to loopback.\nBoth AirPods and AirPods Pro don’t loop back audio, so you don’t get any negative effects whatsoever. You have to go out of your way to loop the audio back with a tool like LoopBack to get any hint of your own vocalizations in the mix.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\nAirPods Pro can be even better in transparency mode if you don’t like to have any attenuation. The Pro on full isolation mode are less effective than Etymotic ER-6 and more effective than foam noise protectors in my experience in terms of external noise and less impactful to making you think your voice is different.\n\nA: *\n\n*I think I'm quite familiar with your problem. Sometimes it makes me stutter when speaking on the phone, and when singing it's just really inconvenient.\n\n*With the Airpods Pro on transparency/pass-through mode, I personally feel that it's very natural to speak or sing with the earbuds in. I think it works really well, without any delay or disturbances that would make it sound unnatural.\n\n", "Q: How to read currency values in Numbers? I have currency values in the following format in a CSV file.\n$171.5M\n$2.74B\n\nHow do I have Numbers recognize these as proper currency values for sorting?\n\nA: You can't use the letters  B or M in the cell. you have to use all the digits.  Open numbers and on the right side of the window, on the top right corner be sure to click on Format. You should have 4 tabs underneath Format that read \"Table, Cell, Text, Arrange.

Both after updating from macOS Mojave 10.14.6 to macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and again when updating from 10.15.5 to 10.15.6, the installation failed with OSStatus error -37. This failure leaves the computer in an endless update loop where it tries to perform the software installation, fails, reboots, and tries again. Forcing the computer to boot from the main internal drive fails: the computer is no longer bootable.\nA clean install does work successfully. But, installing macOS Catalina (or a Catalina update) in-place fails.\nHow can I resolve the installation failure without wiping my computer clean and reinstalling from scratch?\n\nA: I have a small internal drive in my 2018 Mac mini. So, I keep most of my data on a large external SSD. For ease-of-use, I replace most directories in the user home directories with symlinks. That way, for example, the ~/Documents dir points right over to a dir on the external SSD.\nWell, I also use this symlink method for the /Users/Shared directory. It looks like:\n> cd /Users\n> ls -l | grep Shared\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 admin    wheel  34 Jul 19 13:42 Shared -> /Volumes/ExtSSD/shared\n\nRestoring the /Users/Shared directory back to an actual directory — the way it looks as laid down by the macOS Installer — resolves the issue. Now /Users/Shared looks like:\n> cd /Users\n> ls -l | grep Shared\ndrwxrwxrwt  25 root      wheel  800 Apr 17 14:17 Shared\n\nWith /Users/Shared no longer a symlink, the macOS Catalina install/update process works fully and successfully.\n", "Q: Duplicated table in Numbers I think I have exactly the problem described here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250476270?answerId=250909160022#250909160022 - Numbers apparently drawing the spreadsheet on top of itself, offset, for no obvious reason.

I could ping all ip addresses (with allowed IPs: 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0) but no resolving of domain names on macOS.\nBefore I found the solution I noticed that macOS switched the DNS in resolv.conf to the Endpoint ip of the WireGuard server.\nSolution:\nOn macOS I created a new Network profile in System settings under Network with the exact samme DNS address as used in the Wireguard tunnel profile (thus making sure that macOS uses the exact same DNS as the WireGuard tunnel).\nOn the WireGuard server I setup a Local DNS Resolver using Dnsmasq ( https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-setup-local-dns-server-using-dnsmasq-on-ubuntu-20-04/ ). I believe you could use Pihole as DNS resolver in the same way.\nYes, DNS resolving is strange, but maybe particularly strange on macOS.\n", "Q: Square brackets on Swedish Keyboard - MacBook Pro with Catalina MacOs Each time I need to use square brackets '[]' I need to find them somewhere else and Copy & Paste them. I could add an extra language to my keyboard and switch languages every time I need to use square brackets but it would be nice to find simpler way that works with the Swedish keyboard.\nI use Catalina MacOS and I've tried both using the keyboard of my MacBook Pro and and external Logitech keyboard but so far no success.\n\nA: Simplest way to find anything like this is from the Keyboard Viewer, available as an option for the menu bar in System Prefs > Keyboard > Input sources [or also in that pref itself]\nFinding the Swedish layout in that panel shows [ & ] on Opt 8 & 9 respectively.\n\n", "Q: Mac OS disable shutdown prevention when user is logged in At our office, there are tons of different users who use the same Macs running High Sierra over the course of a day. Unfortunately, sometimes people forget to log out after they've used those computers which leads to the last people in office in the evening not being able to shut those computers down without the admin password. I cannot give our Admin credentials to all of them because that would pose a huge security risk. Is there a way to modify Mac OS so that it doesn't ask for the Admin credentials when trying to shut the machine down while another user is logged in?\n\nA: There’s rarely a good technical question to a purely human problem. I heard one company change every account to the cell phone of people that don’t clean up so that everyone would call that number any time someone forgot to log out. Until the person paying the salaries resolves if it’s always IT’s responsibility to clean up after other people or set a standard for people to clean up after themselves, you’ll be stuck. A bit brutal, but it’s better than them losing their data by an unclean shut down.\nThe technical solution would be to trial the feature to log out idle connections and see if that works.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-your-mac-to-log-out-when-not-in-use-mchlp2443/mac\nBarring that, you would enable a non-admin account to force power off / shut down but again, without them taking over the accounts that are logged in, you are left with the damaged app data or unsaved work dilemma. For that, an admin resetting the password would let someone take over the accounts to exit them cleanly, and then presumably lock that person out the next day since they wouldn’t know their password.\nIf you want to go down the path of a command you could enable a non-admin helper account, here are several options:\n\n*\n\n*Way to logout a user from the command line in OS X 10.9\nI prefer you take the tack of explaining the issue, why it’s disruptive when people leave before they clean up and then let the manager manage.\n", "Q: XCode crashes at start (at launch) My XCode crashes with the following error\nProcess:               Xcode [972]\nPath:                  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode\nIdentifier:            com.apple.dt.Xcode\nVersion:               11.2.1 (15526.1)\nBuild Info:            IDEFrameworks-15526001000000000~4 (11B500)\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

I don’t have admin credentials on my machine, so I’m severely limited in what I can change.\nDo I have to reinstall XCode or is there any other solution or workaround?\n\nA: I would make a new user account on the Mac first. Log out of your current user, and then log in to the new user account.\n\n*\n\n*If Xcode crashes in the new account, you will know it’s not any data or user settings and focus on reinstalling the OS / rebooting the OS / reinstalling the app.\n\nIf Xcode does not crash on the new account, now you know how much time to spend triaging it. If you can move all your data and settings to the new account in 30 minutes - spend that time researching this and then move accounts.\nNow, since this is a managed account you are forced to get help from an administrator or read the exact crash and hope it helps you determine why the app is crashing. In this case, you can watch the stack trace on each thread - especially the one that crashes and watch carefully what you do leading up to the crash.\nThread 28 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: Diff queue for DVTDiffContext <0x7fe80b26e9a0>\n0   com.apple.CoreFoundation        0x00007fff2d5cddcb __CFStrConvertBytesToUnicode + 23\n1   com.apple.CoreFoundation        0x00007fff2d5d4633 _CFStringCheckAndGetCharacters + 128\n\nXcode is converting bytes to Unicode, so perhaps this is a class name or something being rendered?\n", "Q: Choose where to save Catalina screenshot individually Should be a simple question: When I take a screenshot, I would like to be able to choose which folder on my hard drive it can go into, the way I can with every single other program (and could in the past with Grab and Jing). But with the Catalina screenshot tool, I cannot find an option to do this. There's a way to change the default folder to save screenshots (so that it doesn't clutter up my desktop by default - thank goodness!), but I can't find any place to choose where to save each individual screenshot when its created, short of pressing Move to Finder and manually moving it myself. Is there some way of choosing the save location that I haven't been able to find yet? Or do I have to change the default location every time, and remember to do that before I hit capture?\n\nA: Yes - after invoking commandshift5, you will see the small dialog with choices for \"entire screen\", \"window\", etc, you will also see a choice for \"Options\". Click that to get a pop-up selection item - that's where you'll find your individual choices for file location.\n", "Q: Two Identical Monitors Plugged in with USB-C I have two identical Lenovo P24h-10 monitors plugged into my Macbook.  Each one has it's own USB-C cord.  I thought about using a single Display Port cord and then daisy-chaining them together, but each monitor has USB outlets that I'm using to connect my peripherals so I don't need a separate hub.  I've noticed there is a 50% chance that the display arrangement will be flipped every time my computer wakes from sleep.  I think this is because there is no way for my computer to differentiate between the two.  Is there a way to set a name on my monitors?\nIn the Display Preferences, each monitor is listed as P24h-10 (1) and P24h-10 (2), and they can change.\nThis seems like a really silly problem to have.  I'm hoping there is an easy fix, but I've been scouring the internet for weeks now looking for some help.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: I've experienced this as well, and there are a few fixes that I've found.\nSolution One\nThis fix involves involve running macros on startup. Here's a link to the \"Keyboard Maestro\" method which includes using a utility called displayplacer on github.\nSolution Two\nIt's possible this is related to spaces/mission control behavior. One easy thing I would suggest is going into System Preferences -> Mission Control and uncheck \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use,\" assuming that is checked. This may solve your problem, maybe not.\n\nSolution 3\nI'm a bit dubious about this one, but it's easy and worth a shot. Basically, you need to remove the Caches folder in your User Library folder. You can try to do this with finder, but I suggest opening terminal and entering\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/ColorSync\nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches\n\nAnd then restarting your computer. Please note that you may clear your user-specific caches with that second command, which include caches from other Applications and things like iCloud. These are caches, so you shouldn't experience any real data loss, but certainly be a bit cautious with this one.\nI wish there was an easy fix. Hopefully the mission control solution works for you, but this seems like it's been a problem for several years.\n\nA: \nIn the Display Preferences, each monitor is listed as P24h-10 (1) and P24h-10 (2), and they can change.\n\nThe problem here has to do with the EDID information the monitor is send the computer.  What's happening is that the monitor isn't sending \"enough\" identifying information that the system can find a unique value.  Most of the time it's a serial number.\nWhat is happening here is that the monitor is being detected and it's getting the model info from each, but everything is identical so you get the parenthetical number after the model to uniquely identify it - it's like what happens when you try to copy a file with an identical name into the same folder; you get file (1) and file (2).  Which monitor goes where depends on which order they're detected.\nIt's like flipping coins - two identical monitors randomly being turned on; law of averages says you've got a 50/50 shot at things showing up the way you expect.\nIf you want to verify this (and you happen to have a spare monitor), plug in a different monitor and you'll see things stay the same.\nIt's not a bug or issue with macOS - it's just dealing with the lack of monitor identifying info as best it can.  There is an app, however, called Stay that has been successful in solving this.  See:  Arrange different external displays of same model to different positions\n", "Q: How can I get back the old split screen behavior from Mojave in Catalina? Back in macOS 10.14 Mojave, clicking down and then dragging on the zoom button would allow you to drag the window to one half of the display, and the window would become full-screen on that half, allowing you to then choose another window for the other side (similar to Windows 10).\n\nUnfortunately, that's been replaced with a rather clunky and unintuitive drop down menu which you have to stop on top of the button, wait for it, and then choose an option. I know this is for sidecar to work, but I don't have a Mac or iPad with sidecar capabilities and I value my gesture-based UI more than capabilities for an option I can't use. (Even if one does have it, why not just \"drag up\" instead of to a side or something, to send to SideCar?)\n\nI'm wondering if there is a Terminal command or something which I can do to revert this to its old behavior. It would be one thing if you could still drag, but get this menu by pausing over it... but they just seemingly disabled (or ripped out entirely) this functionality in favor of a far worse one. I don't usually get bothered by little waits for animations or something, but this does feel like I'm stopping for a sizable amount of time, even for someone who values animations (probably because there is a literal pause in this process).\n\nA: There might be a better solution to enable the old functionality through the OS, but I would be surprised if so. But I've found the free, open-source application Amethyst has been great for my usage.\nTo make sure you're getting the exact functionality you want, I suggest going into Amethyst's Mouse Preferences and ensuring \"resize windows using mouse\" is enabled.\n\n", "Q: How does Fing detect the model and MacOS version of a device I was running Fing on my iPhone. My Macbook Pro is on the same wireless network and I noticed that Fing not only detected my laptop's name (this is understandable, it is broadcasted, I can see it on the router too), but it also detected the model generation  (say Macbook Pro 13 in, 2017-2018) and the MacOS version (MacOS 10.15 Catalina). How is it able to determine the exact model and the exact OS version and is it possible to prevent broadcasting this info?\n\nA: It's called Network Discovery.\nBasically, Fing can get this information because your computer (not limited to Macs) is both broadcasting who/what it's resources are and responding to requests about what resources are available.\nThere's lots of tools (mostly professional) that will do a \"network inventory\" of not only what's connected to your network (type of device), but name, OS, installed software, etc.  Network Inventory Advisor is an example of such software (this one is Windows based, but it's product info pages give good examples of what info can be obtained).\nSo, how can it get it?\n\n*\n\n*DNS Client (how your computer gets an IP address)\n\n*SSDP Discovery - Simple Service Discovery Protocol\n\n*UPnP - Universal Plug & Play\n\n*Zero Config (Bonjour)\n\n*OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier)\nUsing Wireshark (FOSS Network Sniffer) and just evaluating what ports respond, you can start building a network map and determine what computers are on your network.\nThe OUI alone can give you a clue as to what computer's identity - there are many free tools on the internet like Wireshark's OUI Lookup Tool.  Try it for yourself, paste your MAC address (obtained from ifconfig and see what vendor is identified.  You can obtain all of the MAC addresses on your network segment by pinging your broadcast address.\nThese are just some of the services on your client machines that advertise what resources are available.  All Fing is doing is utilizing one or more of these (which one they use specifically, I don't know) to do an inventory of the network.\nPreventing Discovery\nCan you prevent this? To a point.  No matter what, even your MAC address (unless you spoof it) is going to give up some of the goods on you.  Your browser's User Agent String tells whatever server you connect to what your running including the host operating system.  Give it a try with the site WhatIsMyBrowser.com. What does this mean?  Even your applications are giving up the goods on you.\nWhen you attempt to prevent this, you are going to find it difficult to strike a balance between user convenience and perceived security.  These identifiers are shared so that the end user doesn't have to go back to the 1970s and 80s and manually configure services (i.e. printing or network file sharing).  For example, turn off a zero-conf service and you have to manually configure your printer on your client.  You also have to manually configure your printer to not use DHCP because if that IP changes for whatever reason, you have to reconfigure that service again.\nRemember, these services are added for user convenience.  Can you turn them off and firewall your computer so it doesn't respond?  Sure.  Have you secured anything?  Not really.\nIn the book The Art of Deception, the author, Kevin Mitnik (convicted hacker) describes many ways systems are compromised.  There are many tools and steps you can take technologically and yes, you should implement them.  But knowing what OS you're using is irrelevant when the weakest link can be found between the keyboard the chair.  You can turn all of this off tomorrow and with very little effort, can get all this information via social engineering; in other words, just talking to the user.\nTL;DR\nBasically, you can spend a ton of time trying to make your system invisible with firewalls and disabling services and in the process, \"break\" the conveniences that were built into the system that makes your computing experience a good one.  Instead, focus on security practices that harden your system.  Knowing that you use macOS Catalina on a MacBook pro or Windows 10 on a Dell XPS is meaningless if you use the same password on a majority of your systems/services, for example.   You would be better served by focusing on not letting unauthorized people onto your network in the first place and if you do have to allow guests, segment them to their own VLAN with access to nothing but the Internet, put time/bandwidth limits in place and lock down the protocols they can use (i.e. http/https only).\n\nA: The two things you can control on the hardware MAC ethernet address and the macOS Catalina firewall.\nTo prevent detection, try these one by one. Power down your router and Mac so that these things cause a new IP address to be issued between scans.\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the firewall - https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-firewall-preferences-on-mac-mh11783/mac\n\n*Enable stealth mode if Fing still knows who you are. https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-stealth-mode-to-keep-your-mac-more-secure-mh17133/10.15/mac/10.15\n\n*Change your ethernet fingerprint (you have to change all the network adapters / ethernet wired and wireless) - How do I properly change the MAC address of my MacBook Pro?\nWhen this is done, perhaps go back and look at stealth or carving holes in the firewall to allow incoming connections to system / known / signed apps, but if you want the maximum security - changing the factory delivered MAC address and enabling stealth firewall should help secure the hardware details from most scanners.\n\nHow does fing or nmap fingerprint a machine? Usually a database of known claimed hardware manufacturers, looking at open ports and even issuing handshakes to the machine in question to pick apart minute differences in timing and implementation of TCP/IP transactions. It's a lot of reverse engineering and collaboration that lets these tools \"identify\" gear as the manufacturers generally don't want advertise \"I'm a Mac\" now that security and cracking are legitimate threats on home networks since routers and software have so many holes in them and it's hard for people to choose strong unique passwords and secure their \"smart\" devices. Once one is compromised, your whole network is open to \"fing scans\".\n", "Q: Mac won’t connect to internet I have an interesting problem and I believe I may be halfway to understanding it but don’t know how to fix it.

Whats the \"typical\" CPU/MEMORY/THREAD usage per \"display window\" by the O/S process (WindowServer)?\nI'm seeing the following ...\nWindowsServer Usage Statistics:\nAverage CPU Load: 10%\nMemory: 193.0 MB\nThreads: 11\n\nSo the main quesiton I'm asking is \"how much CPU + MEMORY\" load should I expect per additional (1920 x 1080) display?\nThanks!\nAsher\n\nA: There is no such typical cpu/memory/threads \"usage\" per connected display.\nAs a quick test you can watch the values in Activity Monitor and then plug in a few displays to your computer, and then unplug them one by one again. You'll see that there's no fixed value that the usage jumps by. Nor is there going to be on a longer term.\nAll in all the memory usage by WindowServer depends on what each and every GUI application on your computer is actively doing - it is going to be very different over time.\n\nA: The WindowServer responds to the demands of the user and OS to display all the graphical content on the screen.  Its CPU and memory allocation will change depending on how many windows and dialogs you have open. Scrolling, or otherwise animating the display, will increase the load briefly.\nThe values you show are 'not untypical', certainly.\n", "Q: Why is it still not possible to cut files to paste them elsewhere in Catalina? I find it weird that this simple functionality doesn't exist in macOS, as it does in other OS. IIRC, it used to exist in the System 7 era.\nWhat would be the rationale to get this simple functionality out of the window (I should say Apple here, I know ;) )?\n\nA: Because the Pasteboard, to which all data is Cut, is inherently transient and unsafe. If you could Cut a document in the Finder, that document would only reside in the Pasteboard, and any new Copy/Cut action would cause it to be lost.\nYou could never Cut a file in Pre-OS X Mac operating systems.\nHowever, you can achieve the same result by Copying (CMD+C), and then Moving (Option+CMD+V).\n\nA: The clipboard metaphor doesn't really work well for files, and while \"copy file\" can be implemented transparently as \"copy and paste\", \"move file\" requires some judgements.\nAt its simplest, \"copy\" means putting some data into shared memory, and \"paste\" reading it back out; \"cut\" is then \"copy\" plus immediately deleting the source data.\nFor working with files, this would be incredibly inefficient - imagine if you selected a 2GB file and pressed \"copy\", and had to wait for 2GB of data to be loaded into RAM.\nSo instead, file management programs overload the \"copy\" command in some way so that what is put in shared memory is just a pointer to the file. They then overload \"paste\" to run an appropriate \"copy file\" command. The UI will act as though you've \"copied a file to the clipboard\", and \"pasted it from the clipboard to a new location\", but the file content itself is never in the clipboard.\nWith a straight-forward \"copy and paste\", this is mostly transparent to the user - the effect is largely the same as if the content was actually placed in memory. It also achieves what the user wants to do: copy the file on the filesystem, with the clipboard just being a UI convenience to do so.\nThe natural parallel is for \"cut and paste\" to mean \"move file\", but there's a problem. Normally, \"cut\" means \"copy and then delete the original\", but if the data hasn't actually been copied anywhere, the source can't be deleted yet. The actual \"move file\" command has to be executed when the user selects the target directory.\nHowever you implement it, some of the expectations of the clipboard metaphor will be broken by any useful \"move file\" function.\nYou could special case \"cut\" to only delete the source content once it's been pasted. \"Cut\" can place a file pointer in the clipboard with an instruction that when pasted, the \"move file\" command should be used instead of \"copy file\". This makes \"cut and then paste\" work as expected, but if you look at the original file, it's still there until you paste it, which wouldn't be true if you \"cut\" any other type of data. This is how Windows Explorer works, for instance, and it tries to indicate the \"cut but not deleted yet\" state by rendering the file's icon transparent while it's \"in the clipboard\".\nAs a variation, \"cut\" could move the file to a temporary location, so that it is immediately removed from its original location. On many file systems this can be done with practically zero cost as long as the temporary location is on the same partition, by editing two directory entries. Then on paste, move the file from the temporary location to the target. This would make the file disappear immediately when \"cut\", but the user may still notice that \"paste\" is doing the actual move - for instance, a large file which has been \"cut\" will still take up space on its original partition. (I don't know if any OS / file manager uses this approach.)\nAlternatively, you can offer the user a special \"paste\" operation which deletes the original. This makes it clearer that the source file has not been removed yet, but means that the \"copy\" command might result in deleting the source file, which would not be true of any other data. This is what MacOS Finder makes available: after copying a file, the user can choose to move it by pressing Option+Command+V instead of Command+V.\nAlthough these approaches all need some of the same implementation, it would be confusing to offer more than one variation. For instance, if MacOS allowed you to \"cut\" a file, would Command+V do the same thing as Option+Command+V? Or would one of them be unavailable?\n\nA: Insofar as files are concerned, \"cut and paste\" is \"move\" by a different name. With Finder, as you have likely noticed, there is a rule behind its behavior during drag-and-drop operations on files:\n\ndrag-and-drop to the same volume: move is default.\ndrag-and-drop to a different volume: copy is default.\n\nBut if these default behaviors are not what you want, here's how to modify that:\n\nCommand key while dragging changes copy to move.\nOption key while dragging changes move to copy.\n\nIf you find it tedious to remember this, one option is to use mv or cp from the CLI.\n", "Q: Airport Express can't handle multiple devices I have an Airport Express connected to my modem (which provides 60 mbps download speed). The Airport Express is in DHCP + NAT mode, has one computer connected to it via Ethernet, and has other devices connected to it via Wi-Fi.\nFor some reason, when one device on the network is using a lot of download throughput to connect to the Internet (e.g., video streaming, downloading software updates, etc.), the other devices are unable to get more than minimal throughput to the Internet (e.g., simple webpages barely load). The device using a lot of throughput could be connected via Wi-Fi and even the computer connected via Ethernet will get little throughput.\nHas anyone experienced this before and know how to ensure all devices have reasonable throughputs? I assume the issue is with the Airport Express. I have tried restarting the router along with reseting it and setting up the network again.\n\nA: This is normal, especially with older routers like the AirPort.  TCP is a “greedy” protocol, it will take all that it can when it can, so if you have a node (computer on the network) consuming lots of bandwidth other nodes experienced high latency and low throughput.\nYou may or may not remember, but places with free WiFi would often have horrible connectivity when the “business” crowd showed up with their VPN clients.  Basically, they would hog the bandwidth whether they were transferring lots of data or not.  Many places blocked VPN traffic because if this.\nYou need a new, modern router\nThe way you fixed this was you configured QoS (quality of service) for individual clients and protocols.  More advanced routers would  allow “packet shaping” where the router would limit the amount of bandwidth per node and/or protocol.\nModern routers take care of a lot of this for you automatically. Many can allow you to prioritize  traffic.  For instance! http/https takes highest priority, but email takes lowest. More advanced routers (I use pfSense) allow much more granular control to limit bandwidth by node and by protocol/application.  A regular retail, consumer grade router should be enough for your needs.\n", "Q: How to find watt hours of MacBook?

Watt=ampere*Voltage, Wh=Ah*V, so 3582/1000*12553/1000=44.96 Wh.\n", "Q: Slow internet speed with an ethernet adapter on my Mac With the internet connecting to my windows laptop, the ping/download/upload speed is 16ms/157.15Mps/10.21Mps. However, when I connect the same internet cable to a USB 2.0 ethernet adaptor and then to my MacBook Air (2017 model), the ping/download/upload speed is just 24ms/30.07Mps/10.00Mps. This speed is even slower than the internet speed when I connect to wifi.\nIn this post, I see some comments suggesting that only Apple's brand of ethernet adapter works for MacBooks. Can anyone give me advice if that comment is right or any other possible solution to fix the slow internet speed when using an ethernet adapter? Appreciate!\n\n\nA: You can’t evaluate adapter performance by measuring Internet latency and throughput because those things change - like the Network congestion and load of your service provider at that tine.  You need to do this internally where you control the variables.\nYour question is very similar to this one: What dowload speeds is the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter capable of?\nYou need to use the iPerf3 utility to measure the performance internally. It’s free snd simple to use.\nAs for differences in performance, it comes down to the quality of the USB bridge in the adapter and the quality of the Ethernet chip itself; they’re not all created equal.  High quality USB to Ethernet adapters will have low latency (ping results) and higher throughput (iPerf3 results).\nIn your example, the variance in your ping results - 12ms vs 24ms could be due to the quality of your adapter and/or inherent latency of your internet connection.  USB speeds and feeds have nothing to do with this.  Same for your transfer speeds - what you’re seeing is well below USB 2 throughput.  However, it can be affected by the quality of the adapter and/or the inherent throughput inconsistencies of the Internet.\nI actually address the “quality” issue in this post: AX88179 ethernet adapter keeps dropping connection. As far as the comment re: Apple branded Ethernet adapters, the answer is any quality adapter with a compatible chipset will work and perform just fine.  Avoid the inexpensive off brand adapters and stick to brands like Belkin, Anker, Netgear, etc.\nSetup a small test environment as described in the linked answer so you can eliminate the unreliability of the Internet connection and limit your test to variables you can control.\n\nA: In my experience it is not so that only the Apple made Ethernet adapter works with Macs. I have used various 3rd party Ethernet to USB-C adapters and even Ethernet to Thunderbolt adapters (both in docks and in dongles) - and haven't had speed issues with them.\nIn general a USB 2.0 adapter is not going to allow you to transfer data at ful gigabit speeds. However achieving 150 Mbps should not be a problem. USB 2.0 has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 480 Mbps, but in practice I would expect a USB 2.0 Ethernet adapter to max out at about 300 Mbps.\nYou can unlock the full potential of gigabit ethernet by using a USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt 2 Ethernet adapter instead.\nI would start by checking the actual configured speed on the adapter. In the Network Settings (your screen shot) - choose the USB Ethernet adapter and click Advanced.... In the window that comes up, choose the Hardware tab and check that the Speed setting is set to the maximum possible. Usually setting it to configure automatically should do the trick.\nAnother thing is to try different cables, switch ports, etc. - however as you say that you're using the exact same cable with another computer that achieves better speeds then it is probably not going to help.\n", "Q: Cursor-down not working 100% on a end-of-2019 MacBook Pro I've been using a MacBook Pro (ordered in Q4/2019) for about 6-7 months now, and one of the keys (cursor-down) is often reacting sluggishly - I have to press it much with much mor force  than normal. The key shares the cursor-up function, and that side is totally trouble free.\nIs there a safe way to release the key cap to check if it's just a matter of cleaning a speck of dust that may have gone down there? I have found videos that show how to remove a regular key, but don't want to risk destroying the presumably tiny plastic piece on the double-function key...\nAlso, is this keyboard known for being problematic in this way?\n\nA: This sounds like a typical symptom of the butterfly keyboard.\n\n*\n\n*your Mac is less than a year old and should be covered under nornal warranty.\n\n*It may be covered under the Keyboard Service Program\nBoth the 13” and 15” MacBook Pro laptops are covered under the program.  I wouldn’t  attempt a fix as any damage may nullify your coverage.  Just take it in.\n\nA: Self-answer: as suggested by @Allan, if in any doubt, and especially if you still are in the warranty time, the best choice would be to contact your dealer.\nApple suggests to clean the keyboard with compressed air. I did that to no avail, and also gave the whole keyboard a tender scrubbing with a (dedicated, clean) toothbrush. This didn't help either.\nOn the next day, the key decided to get completely stuck in the \"pressed\" position, and I simply had no time to go to my dealer. I decided to gently lift it with the help of a thin, sharp tool. The lower part of the key (the split cursor up/down key) came off just fine. Below that there was the usual butterfly construction. It is delicate; there is a tiny strip of plastic which is not really attached to anything; don't blow on it or it will fly away.\nI gave it a very tiny airstream to get away any specks of dust, and just put the key on again. Lo and behold, it is now unstuck, and also my original problem of not registering the keypress in 50% of activations is gone.\nIf you google, you quickly find videos about how to disassemble and clean the butterfly mechanism itself, but I did not need to do that. The \"half\" key looks just like the regular keys, just literally split in half; it is not any more complicated.\n", "Q: Text encoding problem with old files not newly created ones MBA running 10.13.6\nI keep a lot of plaintext Notes in a shared DropBox folder, synced between an iMac (also 10.13.6) and my MBA.\nThe programs I use to access those notes (The Archive and nvALT) suddenly stopped displaying the notes. nvALT gave a Stopped Responding message in Force Quit.

I have used dd because it is what the tutorials suggest to do for instance when copying Linux images to SD cards (e.g. Raspbian, Kali, ...).\nThis is done at 1 Mb/sec on my macbook pro. I have tried to change the bs option of dd, e.g. bs=1m or bs=10m or bs=100m but copying a 32 Gb image takes hours and the rate is always around 1 Mb/s.\nI read on linux some users suggest to use cat instead of dd .

It's free, fast and even verifies. It's also cross platform.\n", "Q: How to map a MacBook keyboard to write different characters? I have a MacBook computer with Japanese keyboard.\nThe only realistic way to use the keyboard is to change the input source to either British or Australian. So I changed it to Australian.\nOn doing so, I cannot write some characters I need on a daily basis. An example would be backtick (`) or tilde (~).\nThere is an option in Settings to replace the text with some other text. So I replaced OptionN with \"~\".\nBut the thing is it only works with some default Apple apps. I cannot use it on any text editor (and not even Terminal). Is there is any fix for this?\n\nA: if you go to\nsystem preference>keyboarder>input source\n\nthen click on >> option key (alt)\nyou are going to see all even in Japanese\n\nA: I think the characters you need are already there if you use the US or ABC layouts.  Using what is printed on the keys of a Japanese keyboard,\nTilde can be had by typing Shift ^ .   ~\nBacktick can be had by typing Shift @.  `\nBoth of these are actually printed on the keys.\nIf there are others, let us know. If you really need to use the British or Australian layouts instead, this won't work and you should probably make a custom layout based on one of them with Ukelele, which has a template for the JIS Japanese physical arrangement.\n\nA: An alternative is to use a text replacement or text expander.  I’m guessing you used a “Keyboard Shortcut” to assign OptionN as the tilde.\nHowever, this statement is key to the problem you’re experiencing:\n\nBut the thing is it only works with some default Apple apps\n\nThe built in text replacement only works with Cocoa based apps.  For instance, it works in Pages, but not in Microsoft Word.  The way around it is to use a 3rd party text expander.\n\n*\n\n*TextExpander is the market leader and works really well, but it’s very expensive at $40USD /year subscription.\n\n\n*aText isn’t as fancy but works exceptionally well (I personally use this) and is priced at only $5USD; one time purchase.\nThe way they work is you can type a shortcut and it will replace it with the text you’ve defined for that shortcut. For example you can create a shortcut called “tildesymbol” (too long for practical use, but it’s just an example and it will replace it with “~”. I use it for my email addresses.  I assigned @1 to my primary address, @2 to my personal I only give to family and close friends and @3 is my “spam” address that I use when having to “register” for accounts.\nThis is completely different than switching inputs, but it may give you an alternate way of getting the symbols you need without having to remap keys or remember unicode shortcuts.\n", "Q: Budget eGPUs for Mac Mini? I thought it sounded quite cool that you can connect an eGPU to a Mac Mini to boost it's performance, but had no idea just how expensive those things are!\nHere is one I found recommended on a YouTube video, almost £800:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/EVGA-08G-P4-2182-KR-GDDR6-GeForce-Graphics/dp/B07GQTRH9W\nI've tried looking for alternatives but struggle to find any... are there just not that many eGPUs out there or something?\nIt would be good if I could find one for around £200–£300 — I would mainly be using it for the likes of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and After Effects... maybe some 3D software too. I'm not after anything too hardcore, just something to improve on what I already have.\nAre those really unrealistic expectations price-wise?\n\nA: You already have a 'budget' GPU inside the Mini. I would expect the Intel integrated unit to be more than capable of your workload.\nThere is a danger that you spend a lot of money on a GPU and not notice any performance benefit.\nYou can always check Activity Monitor to see if your GPU is being 'overloaded' by your work, using the GPU History panel. It's worth checking to see whether any lack of performance is caused by the GPU, or whether it's just shonky Adobe code.\n", "Q: Software-level volume control for OSX?

I have verbose mode turned on always so I can see if a kernel panic or some error happens. After having it on for a few times, I started to notice that most of the boot was happening after the login. I can't show a picture as it is in boot, but the login screen loads before most of the OS. This is only after a cold boot but I can't seem to find any information on this. All I want is some information on this.\nEDIT:\nBasically, the machine starts to boot, the apple logo pops up, a small box of text scrolls down, where the rest of the monitor is not used, it shows the login screen, and after I type the password, the login screen goes away. now the whole screen is used and the rest of the machine boots up.\nEDIT 2:\nThere is no firmware password. I have not locked the firmware.\n\nA: Boot Process\nBefore you can be presented with a login screen, the OS must be booted.  Granted, there can be \"login items\" which are apps or helpers that can be loaded after a user logs in, but the bulk of the OS (this includes the kernel and related drivers) has loaded by the time you get the login screen where you enter your username and password.\nTo simplify it, if you can log into your Mac remotely before you've entered your login credentials, your Mac has booted completely.  As far as User applications that run in the GUI or get started by launchd (LaunchAgents) those will be started after you've successfully authenticated.  These aren't really part of the OS, but part of the userland environment - they're not required for macOS to boot and run, but they are required for the user experience.  You will see these loading on the screen in verbose mode.\nThe Eclectic Light Company has an excellent flowchart (below) as to the complex nature of the Apple boot process - but one thing to notice is there are a couple places for password input long before the system actually starts booting the kernel.\n\nFirmware Lock\nMac computers both laptop and desktops now have heightened security and provide for a firmware lock.  This protects your device in that it prevents starting up from any internal or external device that wasn't designated a startup disk.\nFileVault\nFileVault is Full Disk Encryption of your storage device.

I got a Mous case which is great in terms of protection  against falls etc.\nHowever it’s got magnets inside for accessories like to attach it to a car dashboard etc.\nCan these magnets damage the phone’s component?\nI’m asking because I know usually magnets aren’t good for electronics but especially because it’s now 2 iPhone XRs that I have that keep doing the same crap: randomly slowing down and or crashing. Especially when trying to take a photo or loading some apps but also sometimes just out of nowhere as I’m chatting in WhatsApp.\nThe first time I got a replacement at the Apple store cause they said the motherboard had a defect.

It could be the following:\n\n*\n\n*your digitizer (the screen input) may be failing.  It may be sending random erroneous input to the system.  If it's happening too quickly or too much, it may be overloading the iPad slowing it down or crashing the App.\n\n*the accessory may be interfering with the capacitive touch.  The digitizer requires something that conducts a small electrical charge (like your skin) or the fabric on those stylus.  The material used may be lightly conductive and inadvertently sending inputs to the device - try removing the cover/case\n\n*software update may need to be installed.\n\n*software or iOS may be corrupt (file corruption does happen).  Try doing a full factory reset and a reinstall of the OS.\n\nI'm leaning toward an issue with the digitizer (it or the case) because this symptom says a lot:\n\nwhen trying to take a photo or loading some apps but also sometimes just out of nowhere as I’m chatting in WhatsApp.\n\nMagnets would corrupt and disrupt things, not open other apps. To get an app to open, you need something to send input to the phone telling it to launch (or switch to it if already open).  Assuming you don't have a preset Shortcut the only thing that would send that type of input is the digitizer.\n", "Q: Which Siri on which device does what? I am trying to figure out which device Siri does certain things. I have a 13\" MBP, iPhone SE 2nd gen., and an iPad Air 2. I know if I ask Siri to set a timer, my phone will set the timer. But, why not the iPad? If I ask Siri to open Google Chrome, which is on all three devices, which device responds?\n\nA: \nI know if I ask Siri to set a timer, my phone will set the timer.\n\nI'm assuming that you have \"Hey Siri\" enabled because I do this many times per day.\n\nBut, why not the iPad?\n\nThe iPad is fully capable of setting a timer via Siri.  I just set one on my iPad by invoking Siri with the home button.  It's also capable of doing so via \"Hey Siri\" as well. If yours isn't doing so - either via \"Hey Siri\" or manually, I suggest we look at this in another question, because that in and of itself is a technical issue.\n\nIf I ask Siri to open Google Chrome, which is on all three devices, which device responds?\n\nI actually tested this.  Siri opens on the device that responds first.  Putting my iPhone next to my iPad and saying \"Hey Siri\" both devices responded however, it was always my iPhone that took control becuase it had the Siri \"tone\" first.  When that tone sounded, Siri on my iPad closed.  For the record, Handoff and Continuity was enabled.\nFor some reason, I don't have \"Hey Siri\" on my iMac with Catalina (10.15.5).  I can only invoke it by clicking the Siri icon or pressing the hot key assigned.  However, I would assume it functions in the same manner.\nAs for putting a priority on the device, decide which one you want to respond to \"Hey Siri\" enabled on one device and not on the others.  It's easy to invoke.  I have mine on my phone since I use it to control Apple Home (my lights, fans, etc.).  I don't enabled Hey Siri everywhere to avoid confusing things.\n\nA: MacWorld has a whole article about this in 2018. From the summary\n\nThe iPhone and iPad are the kings of Siri. Every request I made was answered best by these two devices, and the responses always matched up (though the language often differed).\nThe Apple Watch is the slowest to respond. Often times it would give me an I’ll tap you when I’m ready message before offering up an answer several seconds later, even when connected to Wi-Fi and tethered to an iPhone.\nThe Mac is the worst Siri device. While it's fine for general knowledge questions, It can't set timers or alarms, can't control smart devices through HomeKit, and can't add songs to a playlist. Plus there's no (official) Hey Siri functionality.\nHomePod is by far the best at listening and responding, and it's clear that Apple wants this to eventually be the high-water mark for Siri.\nSiri on Apple TV is woefully underrepresented. It's missing key Siri components, including Hey Siri summoning and audible responses. And its answering left much to be desired, even when asking about movies.\nSiri really needs a personality boost. Apple has added some fun interjections when asking questions and its responses are very natural, but it doesn't play games, read stories, or tell jokes nearly as well as Amazon Alexa or Google Home.\n\n\nA: There's no different version of Siri for different device types. Siri is Apple's digital assistance service and is made available over an active Internet connection. What this means is that a request made to Siri is processed on Apple's servers, and you cannot use Siri without an active Internet connection.\nWith that said, Siri does not generally differentiate or use a different service based on the device type the request is coming from. Siri may or may not allow you to perform an action based on if that feature is available on the said platform.\nFor e.g., you can set a timer on an iOS app as the feature is available into the built-in Clock app. But no such functionality is available by default in macOS.\nAdditionally, it is possible to integrate Siri functionality in 3rd party iOS apps but the same is not available for macOS apps.\nSo even if it's possible to invoke a function available in a 3rd party app using Siri on your iPhone or iPad, the same would not be possible in macOS apps from same developer if they have an app on both the platforms.\n", "Q: MacBook Air 2015 MagSafe charger is too hot to touch In the last couple of weeks, I've noticed my charger connector (the part which connects to Mac) is too hot to touch and also there are some pins a bit burnt (it is happening slowly but getting visibly worse). Charging ability is unchanged but I really like this machine, otherwise, it is working fine.\nI have tried to clean the patches. It is extremely hot only when not fully charged when fully charged it is normal. What could I do? I guess it is not exactly harmless for the machine.\n\n\n\nA: Also this may be caused by (or exacerbated by) dirty contacts.  Clean the pins on the power cable, and the macbook with alcohol.  It can't hurt, and it might help.\nThe heating is because of a weakened electrical connection.  When electricity is forced to go through a dirty connection , or through wires that are too small, it heats those things up.  With a sufficiently dirty, damaged, or loose connection, it will spark through the dirt or the air gap.  When it sparks, it vaporizes some of the metal.  That makes the connection even weaker and smaller.  That vaporized metal lands on whatever is nearby, causing black sooty marks.  It looks like that is what is happening on the plastic around the pins in your connector.  Or it could just be heat causing the plastic to discolor.\nIt's hard to tell, but it looks like the tips of the questionable pins and sockets have lost their gold coating.  That is a sign that the connection has become weak and may be heating up because of reduced contact quality.\nThis can be caused by the springs becoming weak in the pins as well.\nEither way, clean it, try a different (good) adapter for a while, and contact Apple for service if these don't help.\nThe\n\nA: Those are definitely the “high voltage” pins, if you consider 18V DC “high voltage.”\nI would recommend getting a new charger to minimize damage and/or down time.\nThere’s a small IC in that adapter that communicates with the Mac to identify it as having whatever wattage your charger is rated at. When components get hot, it’s because something failed and now too much current is flowing through something.\nAs bad as this sounds, your potential damage is limited.\n\n*\n\n*charger may fail meaning you can no longer charge and you have to buy a new one. This is moot because you should be getting a new one anyway\n\n*may blow the DC-In board. The good news is these vintage Macs has a separate board that interfaced with the MagSafe before sending power to the logic board. If the charger happens to burn this board up, it’s a cheap and easy fix to replace it\n\nBoth of these are more inconvenient than expensive. To be completely thorough, I must say it could damage your logic board, but that’s highly, highly unlikely. But, either way, you need to get a new adapter\nAnd as adapters go, get the one with the highest wattage as you can always use a charger with wattage greater than or equal to what the device requires but not the other way around. So, since that’s a MagSafe 2 adapter, get the 85W charger.  If you happen to add another MagSafe Mac to your “stable” this charger will work regardless of the power requirements.\n", "Q: Trackpad2 clicking feedback stops after 30 seconds from initial use of the day When I open my MBP at the morning, I can feel the clicks for around 30 seconds, and then it's still functioning but without the click feedback. kind of goes to silent clicking mode.\nThe built-in MBP trackpad works fine and I've another trackpad2 at the office that works great.\nTried:\n\n*\n\n*Turn it on and off.\n\n*Connent with cable and without.\n\n*Removed from connected devices and re-add it.\n\n*Went through all the possible checkboxes on Trackpad + Accessibility settings.\n\n\nA: This is a physical issue and not a software one meaning you’ll have to get it replaced.\nThe haptic feedback is basically created by a small electromagnet that creates a vibration. There’s really no “mechanical” device.  However, these components can fail from time to time.\nThe symptom that it works fine for a little while then quits after a few moments points to a bad connection somewhere (like a  dry solder joint) that when things “warm up,” it fails.\nThe fact that the trackpad on your MBP works fine pretty much guarantees it’s not a software issue. Unfortunately that means you’ve got to replace it, but I’ve got clients who simply ignored it and continued to use it without the haptic feedback. For them, it was the track pad built in to the MBP and they preferred to wait until something more “major” needed service like the keyboard or battery to replace it.\n", "Q: How is Messages traffic routed?

Assume the recipient is not using an Apple device (not use iMessage).\nIf I did not have an iPhone, would I be confined to sending messages to AppleIDs (email addresses)?\nIf any additional context is needed to confine a proper question please ask in comments.\n\nA: In answer to question 1, it depends. Some carriers allow WiFi calling on other devices (you can check by going to FaceTime > Preferences > Calls from iPhone checkbox). If WiFi calling is being used, your Mac sends it over the internet to the cell carrier. If it's not, then it's sent through your phone (I'm not sure if it's sent over the LAN or through Apple's servers to the iPhone, but I think it's the first).\nSecond question: correct, you'd only be able to send iMessages to AppleIDs.\nHope this clarifies your questions.\n", "Q: How to prevent MacOs from switching keyboard input method I installed a perfectly fine and working custom layout and it works for everything I use.

So I type a couple of words in Spotlight and nothing useful shows up. When I enter the same words in search bar in Safari I find the result I am interested in.\nWhy doesn’t Spotlight show the same results as in search bar in Safari?\nWhen I type some query words in Safari history using CommandY I can find even more results.\nIs there a way to find more information from Safari history on Spotlight?\nWe can see that it shows completely different results.\n\n\n\nA: \nWhy doesn’t Spotlight show the same results as in search bar in Safari?\n\nIt’s because they use two different search engines.\nIn iOS 8, Spotlight was using Bing (iOS 9 used Bing as well) whereas Safari was defaulted out of the box to use Google, but you could, obviously, change that. According to Wikipedia, Spotlight search uses Bing but goes through Apple’s servers first with a unique identifier that changes every 15 minutes.  However, it’s still 2 different engines, thus the different results and the non-matching history.\n\nSince the release of Yosemite, Spotlight sends all entered queries and location information to Apple by default. The data is accompanied by a unique identifying code, which Apple claims to rotate every 15 minutes to a new identifier. In response to privacy concerns, Apple has stated that they do not use the data to create profiles of their users, and that query and location information is only shared with their partner, Bing, under a strict contract which prohibits the information from being used for advertising purposes.\n\nSo, not only is it two different search engines, the search is actually sent to Bing through Apple with an identifier that technically doesn’t come back to you, so the search history will be different even if you standardize on Bing.\nIMO, I’ve been using Bing instead of Google for a while now and I can honestly say that the results are better, easier to filter ads versus genuine search results and I have less of my search activity going to aggregators who sell it to advertisers.  So, if it’s still Bing, I don’t have any issue with that at all.\nUpdate:  After further research, in 2017, Apple switched from Google to Bing (quietly, I might add).  The process is still the same - the search  goes through Apple's servers first as they did with Bing.\n", "Q: D-Link DIR-880L + Mac => monthly data usage stats possible? Any idea how to track network data usage (how many GB in/out total per month) from a D-Link DIR-880L router?\nI tried PeakHour (https://peakhourapp.com/) but it looks like this router doesn't support SNMP and using UPnP straight up didn't work (and their support is non existent…).\nXfinity is not unlimited anymore where I live and they're saying I used 65GB just yesterday, and  1.1TB total this month which is not even remotely possible from how I use the web, so I need to figure out what's going on… (assuming they're not just inflating the numbers like crazy )\nI'm pretty frustrated with the \"crappy software with no update ever\" business model of D-Link so I'm thinking about maybe buying a Synology router instead (already have a NAS from them and I like their OS) but I'd rather spend $0 with some Terminal Voodoo or something like that \nAny pointer in the right direction MUCH appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: \nI'm pretty frustrated with the \"crappy software with no update ever\" business model of D-Link so I'm thinking about maybe buying a Synology router instead (already have a NAS from them and I like their OS) but I'd rather spend $0 with some Terminal Voodoo or something like that\n\nAhhh yes... You've seen the light!  Consumer grade routers are just too limited for what they do.  You need a proper router that has the ability to measure your bandwidth.\nAs for Terminal \"voodoo,\" no.  There's no magic command that allows you to simply measure the amount of data that has gone out to the internet.  75% of it is how you architect the hardware setup.  If not your router, you need to somehow put your computer (it's network interface) between your router and your network so it can \"count\" all of the network packets going in and out.  It's like having a bouncer at a bar with one of those click counters but instead of putting him at the door, he sits at the bar - there's no way he can accurately count the patrons coming and going; you need him at the door.\n\nbut I'd rather spend $0\n\nThen you want pfSense.  I'm a huge fan of Synology and make heavy use of the NAS gear.  As for networking, I swear by pfSense for my routing.  First off, it's free.  Their model is either to purchase their appliance or purchase managed support.  You can install pfSense on a cheap Core 2 Duo.  Your biggest expense will be a quad Ethernet port if you want to have a DMZ or handle multiple LANs.  I put one because I put my guest WiFi network on it's own network and kept them separate from everything else.\nHere's just one of the sample Stats reports (Traffic Graph) that comes out of the box.\n\nHowever, based on your premise for starting this project, no more unlimited bandwidth, you can set up traffic limiters to prevent going over.\n", "Q: Why does a Macbook pro's internal screen flicker ONLY when it is on a GPU? I have a Macbook pro 2017 (15 inch, touchbar).\nSince a couple of months ago, once the laptop is on GPU for a long time (at least 3-4 hours), the internal screen starts to flicker, like this:\n\nThe flickering gets worse until the internal monitor turns into blank screen (even though it is technically ON, the backlight is working, but it shows just a black image). The external monitors have no issues at the same time and show the correct image.\nI took the laptop to Apple genius bar and showed a recorded video of the issue. Apple repair team could not reproduce the issue even after a video triage (because it only appears after some hours of use). Despite that, they REPLACED the Logic Board, the Top Case, the I/O Board, and the battery, hoping that the issue will never show up again.\nUnfortunately, screen flickering re-appeared after receiving it back.\nWhat could be the cause of this issue?\nHere are my speculations:\n\n*\n\n*It's NOT a GPU issue: The GPU is attached to the logic board and is recently replaced, while the problem persists. Besides, when the internal monitor starts to flicker, the  external monitors that use the same GPU (though, via USB-C) do not flicker. It only happens for the internal monitor.\n\n\n*It's NOT an internal MONITOR issue: Screen flickering appears only after hours of use, when the GPU is enabled (i.e. when the laptop is connected to the external display, OR if I disable the internal Intel graphics card in power settings). Interestingly, when the screen flickers, switching back to the internal intel graphics card resolves the flickering. I just have to detach the external monitors and/or enable automatic graphics switching, and the flickering disappears after a few seconds. Detach the external monitors and the internal monitor starts to flicker again.\n\n\n*It is related to heat but not all about overheating: The problem only arises after a few hours of use, but I don't think there is an OVERheating issue. When the screen starts to flicker, none of the GPU sensors shows a high temperature. The internal sensor reports a GPU temperature of at most 55°C.\nWhat else could be the cause of the this? It's weird enoguht that half of the laptop is replaced but the issue is still there..\nMy own hypothesis is that:\n\n*\n\n*The LVDS cable that transfers data from the GPU to the internal monitor is affected by heat or damaged... But I wonder... Isn't it the same cable that transfers data from the \"Internal HD Graphics card\" to the internal monitor? Why does it only happen when I am using the GPU? Is it easy/cheap to replace this cable?\n\n\n*Since the GPU is OK for the external monitors (all 1080p) but flickers for the internal monitor (2880-by-1800), then maybe the GPU cannot feed a high-resolution screen when it is warmed up (again, heating issue?)\nWhat could be the cause if this mystery?\nP.S.

My old harddrive is now in an enclosure and I'm trying to access my old Notes from there, I forgot to back that up. I never connected that laptop to iCloud, and from seeing other articles/answers, I tried to find the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes but I could not even find this Library folder.\nFor curiosity sake, I tried finding it on my current SSD and at first I couldn't, but then I clicked Show View Options and added Library to the view.

The USB cable may be damaged and no longer allows for communication between the iPod and the USB port.  If possible, borrow one from a friend (preferred method), or you may have to purchase another one.\n\n\n*Verify that the Shuffle works.  If you can't get it to work (i.e. play music) then you definatley have a problem with the iPod.  If it will not communicate on the USB port, it's likely that the iPod USB interface has died.

I have two work-flows, one uses Mountain Lion, the other uses Mojave.  So ideally I would like to be able to easily switch between the two boot drives I have whenever I need to.\nWhen I have booted from Mojave, I can choose System Preferences -> Startup disk, and then my Mountain Lion drive is there, and I can select it and boot from it.\nHowever, when I boot from Mountain Lion, it says \"the disk you inserted was unreadable\" and there is no option to choose it from the System Preferences -> Startup disk.\nMany resources online say \"hold down option when booting and select your boot drive\", but this does not seem to work for me.  When I hold option down, it does not present any options for drives and just continues to boot Mountain Lion...  How can I do this without the annoyance of having to physically remove the drive I don't want to boot?\n\nA: One possible explanation is that Mojave is on an APFS volume, which Mountain Lion doesn't know about. It's possible that your Mac's firmware also needs updating if the APFS volume is not being shown in the Boot Manager thing (Option at Start).\nSeemingly, you have managed to get Mojave booted somehow, so it's not an incompatibility/lack of support for your hardware.\nI currently run Mountain Lion in a Parallels VM, on my Mac running Mojave.

My MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) running macOS Catalina 10.15.6 (19G73) will inevitably kernel panic while in sleep mode when my external display (LG Ultrawide 34UC98-W) is connected via an Apple Thunderbolt USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.\nThe issue appeared a few weeks ago and since then has become a daily occurrence. I am able to disconnect my external display from power via a smart plug but I generally forget to, and when I do I end up coming back to a MacBook that has panicked and restarted.\nMore recently, my MacBook has started waking from sleep correctly but not detecting the external display anymore. This is even more frustrating because no amount of fiddling with the cable or the settings will fix this. Only a restart will cause the MacBook to detect the screen again.\nWhat can I do to stop these issues from occurring?\nEDIT: Here is an example panic log.\n\nA: Surprisingly, Apple Support’s advice of resetting the SMC and NVRAM was actually the solution to this issue.\n", "Q: Make a global shortcut for a particular app From Apple KB - Use global keyboard shortcuts on Mac,\n\nNote: You can create keyboard shortcuts only for existing menu commands. You cannot define keyboard shortcuts for general purpose tasks such as opening an app or switching between apps.\n\nI want to know if there is a utility or a hack to make a shortcut for a particular app work even when the app is minimized. In my case, I am trying to assign a shortcut to OBS to start/stop recording even when minimized.\nTo explain better, consider this scenario. My active app is Firefox (or any other app). OBS is running in the background and is visible in the top menu bar. I press a shortcut key combination and OBS starts to record screen. Currently, this doesn't works if the active app is not OBS itself. The reason is, this shortcut is local to OBS. I want a way to assign it as a global shortcut.\n\nA: It sounds like you want to switch to the OBS Studio App so you can switch scenes, etc.\nYou can use Automator to create a custom service to launch the application of choice and bind a global keyboard shortcut to do so.\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator, select New Document and Choose Quick Action (Service)\n\n*In Workflow Receives (Service Receives) drop-down list select No Input\n\n*Drag Launch Application from the Actions list to the right side\n\n*Select the OBS App as the Launch Application\n\n*Save the Automator Quick Action (Service) as \"Launch OBS\"\n\n*In System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services scroll down and find Launch OBS and set a keyboard shortcut for it.\n\nThis will open OBS and bring up the minimized window and it will unhide it as well.\n\nThere's a great deal of potential solutions that may be even more useful in controlling OBS. If you rethink your workflow a bit, the deeper problem is controlling OBS while you are streaming or recording.\nOBS has a websocket API and can be remotely controlled via a web browser but it can also be remotely controlled via iOS/iPad Apps as well as actual hardware controller boxes (stream deck or MIDI controller) with a myriad of programable buttons and dials to control OBS and a lot more.  You can add an inexpensive second monitor, even an old iPad setup as a second monitor and put OBS on the iPad.\n", "Q: Change email reply's automatic object When I reply to an email, the object is automatically set as \"Re: {object of the previous email}\".\nI would like to change the \"Re:\" and have \"Rép:\" instead.\nIs that possible?

In most cases, pressing -= yields zero.\n\n*After pressing = once, additional presses apply the last operator and operand to the displayed value.\n\n*The bug is that if there is a low-precedence operator (like +) being deferred because a higher precedence operator (like x) is computing, the low precedence operator moves to the end of the equation for the initial computation.\n\nExamples from the original question\nInput: 4+3x3x3x= \nOutput: 135\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*4+3x puts 4 on the stack while it computes the higher priority 3x...\n\n*3x3x3 is 27\n\n*When you end with x= it has to decide what to do for the final x to complete the equation.

If I right click on it in the Dock and \"Quit\", it remembers the session next time I open it.\nSo, is there a way to make the \"close\" button behave as \"quit\" if the window I’m closing is the last one open?\n\nA: You can use CMD + Shift + T to reopen a window that was accidentally closed and CMD + Shift + N for me just opens a new Incognito window.\nI think I have a pretty good solution for you, I hope :) Plus, it will solve another, possibly bigger issue - at least for me.\nHistory\nI'd curse at my computer multiple times a day, threatening to toss it out of my fifth-floor apartment window  Macbooks are expensive - why am I having to deal with memory issues? Maybe they got their shit together with the new M1 chips this year. I'm saving up slowly for 15\" or 16\" in 2021.\nAfter putting in real work time with 4 different browsers over the course of about 6 days, noting my device's performance under normal working conditions, and being flexible with workflows in each browser, I came back to Chrome.\nI continued searching high and low for an answer to my dilemma with no luck. I ultimately came up with my own little solution, implementing two wonderful plugins. They also added some benefits that I didn't even know I needed, which is something that'll help you automatically saving your windows' state of tabs, while also along you to save collections of tabs manually.\nI don't know how I've survived this long...\n\"Chrome Tab Hoarder\" and \"Memory Efficiency\" Achievements Unlocked!\nConfession - I knew my memory issues were caused by the fact that I had 15 browser tabs open.\nNo idea why you're bringing up that I'd save these growing number of tabs to maybe look at them a few days later... Whatever! They were important at the time \nGet the Toby Chrome extension to automatically save any and all browsing window states whether your computer stroked out or you quit Chrome on purpose. It's even better than what I was originally searching for because you can save (and edit at any point) Collections of tabs. This is by far my most used and favorite thing that I've discovered in 2020 (along with my web design software, Figma, and upgraded web development workflow).\nThe perfect companion extension for Toby is called The Great Suspender. It will cause you to yell at the sky screaming profanities a lot less because your computer will run SO much better. Suspended tabs use significantly less energy and memory. If you have tabs open and don't use them within 30 minutes, it'll stay there in your tabs, but be suspended and not use resources. When you click on the tab, it reloads. It won't suspend any tabs that have input fields with information in them or ones that actively play videos or sounds. You have options to not suspend any tabs from a particular domain, particular URLs (I don't suspend Gmail, ClickUp, and some others), customize the amount of time before suspending a tab, etc\nI hope this helps some people! It may sound like a lot but give it an honest couple of days and see what you think, especially those of us who are tab hoarders/whores/junkies lol.\nI literally have 46 tabs open between two different windows - oops  My 3-year-old MacBook Pro has that plus Photoshop and 6 other open apps.

I got back 349 ) com.apple.tccd but am not sure what that means or if it's relevant.\nYou think this is fixable in code or do I just need to buy an external camera/deal with repairs?\n\nA: The FaceTime webcam has died.\nThis is basically a duplicate of this question about a MacBook Pro camera but you've done a lot more diagnostics.\nYou've got two options:\n\n*\n\n*Replace the FaceTime webcam.  I don't recommend this option unless you intend to do other work inside your iMac like upgrade your hard drive to an SSD.  This requires removing the screen which means you'll have to cut through the adhesive holding the screen to the frame; it's a very time consuming and tedious task requiring the purchase of adhesive strips for the display when reassembling\n\n\n*Get a USB Camera.  While my FaceTime camera works, I actually use a USB webcam (Logitech Brio) so I can get 4K resolution which is much higher than the FaceTime HD camera's resolution of only 1280x720.  The color is also much more vibrant on the Logitech making for a much better picture.\nBasically, the fact that it doesn't work in Safe Mode (after a reboot) and doesn't work with Apple’s own built in software that works with it (i.e. FaceTime and PhotoBooth), pretty much says this is a physical issue.  Unless you're up for removing the glass on the iMac, go with an external USB webcam.\n\nFuture Diagnostics:\nI just wanted to provide some pointers for future diagnostics for folks who may be looking to solve this (or other hardware issues).  Here are some tips to guide you in diagnosing the problem:\n\n*\n\n*Hardware can be \"recognized\" but not work.  It's like having all 4 wheels removed from your car.  It will start, shift into all the gears and no engine light will turn on, but you car isn't going anywhere.\nIn this case, the controller (aka the USB bridge - an IC or “chip”) can still work, but the sensor (what captures the image) just dies. So, the system still see's it attached to the USB bus, but you get no image.\n\n\n*Plugging in another USB Webcam is the best diagnostic test.  The integrated FaceTime camera is also attached to the USB bus so if a different USB webcam works and the integrated one doesn't it's pretty much guaranteed that the issue is the camera itself.\n\n\n*Running Safe Mode (Hold ⇧ Shift\nwhile booting) is an excellent troubleshooting tool as it eliminates 3rd party software and drivers (kexts).  Also, since it requires rebooting, you know everything is starting \"fresh.\"\n\n\n*Apple Diagnostics (Hold D while booting) is also an excellent tool, but it sometimes cannot detect things that don't generate errors (like in this case).\nLike your eyes, you may lose function as you age (the failure), yet you don't experience pain (the error code).  This is why we do alternate tests.\n\n\n*Disabling security is not a good idea. SIP only protects certain folders from having things written to it.  Disabling security, especially when the device was working before won't yeild much return in the way of diagnostic info.\n\n\n*Resetting the SMC and NVRAM is rarely a fix for anything.  You'll see these recommendations everywhere and the result is usually fruitless.  It's because the SMC handles power and cooling (fans) while the NVRAM handles the pre-boot environment like setting the boot device, and initial boot screen resolution.  There's nothing in it that addresses peripheral devices like webcams or software.\n\n\n*Updating your OS is always a good idea.  Apple's been known to break things with updates and new OS releases.  Now with APFS and it's ability to take snapshots of your hard drive, the converse is now true - rolling back is a good idea if you apply an update and something breaks.  APFS allows you to roll back your OS to a point where it was working - it's an \"undo\" for your Operating System.\n", "Q: Restoring a new iPhone from backup fails with no error or message, why?

How can I make SnailSvn use vimdiff or any custom diff script?

I did a hard reset 3 times and it was good for a little bit. Now last week it shut off and I tried doing a hard reset and it wont turn on. What do I do??\n\nA: There might be an issue with your phone's battery. Check out Apple's iPhone Battery and Performance page and scroll down to the \"Preventing unexpected shutdowns\" section. They have a very detailed explanation of various factors that contribute to unexpected shutdowns.\nIf your phone is unexpectedly turning off even whilst connected to an AC power supply, then there might be an issue with your phone's hardware and you should contact some technical support for further help and inquiries.\nIf there's absolutely nothing wrong with your phone's battery or other hardware, then it might be some app or other piece of software that's causing the issue, and you should most probably do a complete factory reset of your phone. It's definitely not an iOS software bug, that much I can tell you.\n", "Q: Is there any app or anyway for mac to search within a video's texts/transcription This might be a very niche thing, but I have a lot of local and downloaded videos on my Mac that I keep for educational purposes, and was wondering if it's possible to search through the transcriptions/speech within the video.\nI know searching in finder allows the ability to search within text documents and file contents, I'm looking for something similar for videos.\nI'm willing to manually attach the transcriptions myself to every video if that's required, since there are many apps that can do that. But the ability to search my entire Mac, like in finder, for a certain phrase and see which videos contain those search results would be extremely useful.\nThe closest thing available right now natively on macOS is to just paste as much of the transcript inside the comments section of the video's 'get info'. Doing this allows searching in finder and getting the video in the search results but there is character count limit so it's very limiting.\n\n\nA: If the mp4 file has a subtitle track, you could extract the text to a .srt file using mp4box (more info can be found at How to extract subtitles from MP4 and MKV movies. Of course, you would need to do this for every file you have then search within those .srt files.\n\nA: Spotlight Importer\nWhat you are looking for is a Spotlight Importer for movie file subtitles. There are numerous open source importers on GitHub.\nIf none match your needs, consider writing a Spotlight Importer to index the embedded subtitles. Importers look complex to write but they are not too bad. Be sure to start with the Xcode template project.\n\nA: A Terminal-based approach is rga. It can extract video metadata such as chapters and subtitles and creates a cached index for fast searching. It searches .mkv, .mp4 and .avi files.\n", "Q: Using Siri to automatically add Outlook events to iCal Calendar Context\n\nThere is currently a feature for Apple Mail whereby you can enable Siri, such that it will automatically add any event/invitation picked up in Apple Mail to your iCal calendar.

(Caches, fonts, location tracking and temporary data etc.)\n\nA: These numbers do not add up on iOS 13.6 and lower in my experience. Apple has started patching the system to make these more accurate on iOS 13.6.1\n\nBe sure you check other storage in addition to the on my device portion after a clean power down and connect to power. I think the metadata collection and snapshot freeing run better when connected to power and that there is a gradual cleanup so the numbers are shifting daily in my experience for both my iPhone and iPad but they are aligning much better than before.\n\nA: Under the part that says xx of yy used is a color scale that shows you what makes up the used portion of memory.

If anyone know how to fix it...\nCreate a new app in Xcode\nThis step requires no coding whatsoever. Open a new Project as a Document-based application, using the file extension of the file type you want to change.\n\nUnder 'Assets.xcassets' in the sidebar, click on the + icon and under App Icons & Launch Images, select  create a New MacOS Generic Icon.\n\nAdd the correctly sized images to the empty squares.\n\nNext, in Targets > Info, define the Document Types fields with the relevant data for your file type. Select the Icon resource, and you should get the icon in the empty square.\n\nYou can do the same for Imported UTIs, just to cover all bases.\n\nYour app should build and run without any further effort. Quit it. Back in Xcode, right-click on the app product and select \"Show in Finder\". Move the app to the Applications folder.\n\nThe LaunchServices database may not immediately update with your new app and its icons. One tip to force it to update is to copy and paste an icon into the icon square in Get Info on any file. You can delete the change immediately.\nSet your app to be the default app for the file type.\nThis is done in the usual way in Get Info window. The Finder might not update existing windows: close and reopen to see the icon change.\n\nSubstitute the binary\nRight-click on your new app. Select Show Package Contents. Navigate to the MacOS folder, and delete the Unix executable file inside, with the name of your app.\nIn another Finder window, navigate to the similar MacOS folder inside the bundle of the application that you want to open the file. (In my case, BBEdit.)\nIn the Terminal, type ln (that's lowercase LN) followed by a space. Then drag the Unix executable of the 'destination' app onto the Terminal window. Then drag the the empty Macos folder of your app onto the Terminal window. The completed command should look something like this:\nln /Applications/BBEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/BBEdit /Applications/PostScript.app/Contents/MacOS\n\nPress Enter.\nYou should now have a hard link to the destination app (BBEdit) in your dummy app.\nOne important thing left to do: rename this link to the name of your app. (In my case, 'PostScript'.) You could do this in one step as part of the Terminal command above, by appending the name.\nln /Applications/BBEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/BBEdit /Applications/PostScript.app/Contents/MacOS/PostScript\n\nDone.\nAs long as your dummy app and the destination app are both installed, files will display the custom icons, and launch with the app of your choice, without modifying installed apps. There doesn't seem to be any speed penalty, either.\n", "Q: Storage Management on Catalina displays nonexisting apps. How to fix?

I have iCloud photos and a massive cloud library of ~700GB which used to be all squished into my 64Gb iPhone X, taking up around 22Gb. I recently wanted to free up space to do a WhatsApp backup, but that required 13Gb of free space which I didn't have, so I decided to untoggle iCloud Photos and delete all my local photos except for my 13 most recent ones.\nAfter hours of manually doing that, and emptying the recently deleted photos, I made sure that there was literally thirteen photos on my phone. But somehow Photos is still taking up 13Gb... What is going on???\nMy only possible explanation is that my Whatsapp takes up 12.5Gb, and the system is double counting the media on it. Could that be why? Then I'm in a dilemma because I need to free up another 5.5Gb according to WhatsApp to do a full backup\n\nA: You should go to settings on your iPhone. From settings go to general and then go to iPhone storage. Underneath the total memory statement is a colored scale showing what apps and others are being used.  If you scroll down even further it gives you the amount of memory used by each app. You can check the size of Whatsapp on your phone.\n", "Q: iMac has two internal drives, what is the best setup? My iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2014) has a permanent internal 120GB drive on the main board and I just added a 2TB SSD internal drive as well.\nI'm essentially starting over with a clean system.\nI'm wondering what is the best setup for these two drives? By best I guess I mean 'safest'. I just went through having a dead fusion fusion drive and losing data so I'd like to be careful and smart about how I set this up.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Format your SSD as APFS and use it as your boot drive. That will make a noticeable speed improvement over using a magnetic disk. APFS is optimized for SSDs and runs poorly on spinning platters, so format your 120GB drive as HFS+.\nYour 120 GB drive is nearly worthless at this point. Maybe you could use a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner to keeps some important documents backed up to it, but really you should be using Time Machine. Maybe use the 120 GB drive for downloads or something.\nAs for what kind of drive to use for Time Machine, definitely get a 3.5\" Hard Drive (best value), and I recommend getting bare drives plus a dock rather than drives in an enclosure, again because you get better value that way. Beyond that there are 2 schools of thought:\n\n*\n\n*As Apple did with Time Capsule, you buy a single rugged drive that is unlikely to fail. Get one designed for 24/7 server use with a 5 year warranty. Something like the Hiachi Western Digital Ultrastar.\n\n*Buy 2 drives and alternate backups between them. Expect they will both fail at some point, just hopefully not at the same time. For this, buy ordinary internal drives. To help ensure they do not both fail at the same time, I recommend buying drives from 2 different manufacturers. 2 Drives also allows you to keep one off-site, which can be critical if your computer and backup drive are both stolen, destroyed in a fire, or suffer some other common catastrophe just due to being in the same place at the same time.\n\nOne thing to be careful about, especially with high capacity drives, are drives that use Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR, DM-SMR). Long story, but those devices perform fine when used as Time Machine backups until Time Machine starts pruning old files, at which point they perform quite poorly. What is worse is that it can be hard to tell if a drive uses SMR because some manufacturers fail to disclose this. So I would stick with drives labeled for use as internal desktop drives (not RAID or NAS drives) unless you have assurance that the drive does not use SMR.\n2 other sources for information about disk drives to consider\nYou can look for disk reliability data published by heavy commercial users. Backblaze publishes their report about every quarter. The Q1 2020 report is here. Any drive they have selected to test will be high enough performance, and you can judge for yourself the reliability, which Backblaze explains in great detail. I think some other companies publish similar reports.\nYou can also pick your favorite NAS or RAID system and stick with the list of certified compatible drives. Just make sure you select a system that is a high-performance system, not something touted as a cheap media server or something like that. As a random example, here is a link to the compatibility list for the Synology 220+. Being on a list like that would assure me that the drive will perform well enough for Time Machine.\n\nA: The built-in 120GB is part of the Fusion drive.  A Fusion drive is a software solution where two physical disks are joined as one drive.  If either disk fails you can lose all data.  Sounds like your 3TB HDD experienced a fault which is not unusual after 6 years of life.  The 120GB SSD is soldered to the system board so that cannot be replaced It is replaceable. Just on the backside of the main system board and not as easily accessible like the HDD.  Fusion originally appeared using JHFS+ file system and CoreStorage containers to create the Fusion. When Apple announced it, I was able to implement Fusion on a Mac Pro 2010 by using the command line diskutil.  With the new APFS and APFS Containers Fusion still works under Mojave and up.\nFusion is vulnerable to losing all data if either the SSD or HDD fails. Since you now have two SSD's it doesn't make sense to combine the two for the same reason.\nInstall macOS and everything else onto the new larger SSD that you installed. Here's a few ideas on how to use that 120GB Apple SSD. You should format the 120GB drive.\n\n*\n\n*Keep the drive as a second disk use it for scratch space. Some applications can benefit from this such as Adobe Photoshop. Having a different disk on a different controller can improve performance while the main disk is busy.\n\n*Mount the drive to a folder in your Home folder to make it easily accessible. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/291154/382818\n\n*I wouldn't trust that Apple SSD as it's 6 years old so don't put anything on it you don't mind losing if it suddenly decides to fail.  SSD's have a limit on the number of writes and it's been running for 6 years under Fusion. Fusion puts the most frequently used files on the SSD so it likely that disk has been worked rather hard.\n\n*The Apple SSD can be replaced and there is the IFIXIT teardown for that model. The process is not too bad if you are adventurous. It is a PCIe drive not an NVMe drive.\n\n", "Q: syntax error near unexpected token `(' I was given a script to automate some processes.

I have a Catalina Mac server with an attached Drobo drive, shared over SMB to my local network. I have another iMac that writes large amounts of data to that drive. This has been working fine for over a year. A couple months ago I updated my server to Catalina. Then I discovered that the drive would disconnect. I switched from SMB to AFS and the problem went away. Abruptly this past weekend the issue has returned.\nI test this condition by mounting the drive on any Mac on my local network and dropping a large file onto it. Within seconds, the drive becomes non-responsive, and after a few minutes will disconnect from my Mac.\nI can't find any log message to suggest what's happening. I've tried fiddling with all the Sharing settings on the server, messing with the /etc/nsmb.conf file, but to no avail. I'm considering putting a Linux box in place and removing the Mac altogether; this needs to work! But I'm out of ideas for fixing this issue.\n[Update]: I noticed something odd: my Drobo has a second volume that I don't use for much. I tried using that over sharing and it doesn't seem to have the same issues! I've used DiskWarrior on the problematic disk (the file directories were in good condition) and Disk First Aid (no problems), but I'm wondering what could possibly be different about this one?\n\nA: I realize the problem: the first Drobo volume is at max capacity.\n", "Q: What is the 'xmessage' command equivalent on macOS?

I know Mac doesn't have a registry, but malware could similarly run as a background process, service or helper tool.

For most of them, I do not understand what they do or if they are really necessary. I worry on the one hand that they might slow my system down. In the worst case, I worry that I may have malicious software running in the background (e.g., Zoom's hidden web server).\nHence, I was wondering whether there was a software similar to Hijackthis that scans processes and gives some info about them, possibly with an assessment of their quality, risk.

I use the \"storage optimisation\" feature on my Mac. Part of this feature is that it deletes local files to save on local storage, and files can then be downloaded when needed.\nI like this feature.

I just want to keep the file permanently on my local hard drive.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is currently no file or folder level controls for storage optimization. It's an all or nothing feature, which is really too bad.\nHere are your options as I see them:\nOption 1: Turn off Storage Management\nSystem Prefs -> Apple ID -> (uncheck) Optimize Mac Storage\nBy default this keeps everything. You can Right click -> Remove Download for any files in an iCloud drive you don't want to keep locally. But you'll have to manage them by hand.\nOption 2: Move the file out of an iCloud folder\nStorage Management will stop deleting the file, but it also stops syncing.\nOption 3: Use another service\nYou could keep Storage Management on for most files but move the things you need more control over into another cloud service (ie dropbox) that does what you want.\nOption 4: Open the file frequently\nIn theory Storage Management will keep files you \"open frequently\".

This is pretty easy to do with Automator using a script like this:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke input\n    end tell\nend run\n\nHowever, macOS Catalina's security permissions trigger the following alert for any application I use this in for the first time.\n\nNot only is this a nuisance (you have to do it every time),  the security implications seem to be pretty wide ranging.\nMy best alternative is to just copy my input to my clipboard and manually paste each time, but I would like a single keybinding to just dump  my script output at the current cursor in any application.\nIs this wildly insecure? Is there a way I can just paste at current position without a security pop up and be safe?\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/a/457238\n\nA: Don't use System Events to do this.  As well as the difficulties you've discovered, it's also a pretty unreliable way to do this, a potential security risk, and—thankfully—not at all necessary.\nHere's an outline of how to use Automator to insert the date at the cursor's location in the currently active application:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new† Automator workflow, selecting Quick Action as the type.  Enter the name you wish it to go by, but try and be sure because changing it later in this particular instance could be irksome.\n\n\n*When you're presented with the newly-created, blank workflow, there are options at the top that allow you to dictate what sort of input you can pass to the workflow, and in which applications the service will be available.  Set these to the following:\n\n*\n\n*Workflow receives: no input\n\n\n*in: any application\n\n\n\n\n*The third option you need to select is this one:\n\nThis—as the name suggests (in a slightly misleading way)—causes the Quick Action to run as normal, and at the end of its run, the final result—assuming it can be represented as text—will replace the currently active text selection, much like when one pastes the contents of the clipboard into their document.  If a text object permits highlighting of its text content, then it will always contain a text selection object, regardless of whether or anything text is highlighted.  In this instance, i.e. most of the time, it is located wherever the cursor is, and contains zero characters.\n\n\n*Create a Run AppleScript action.  Delete any default script text that it contains so you have a blank editing field, into which you can paste the following code:\ntell ((current date) - (time to GMT)) as ¬\n    «class isot» as string to return the ¬\n    contents of [text 1 thru 10, space, ¬\n    text 12 thru -1] as text\n\nThis produces an formatted date and time derived from the ISO-8601 international standard, and looks like this: \"2020-07-26 14:21:11\".  It's basically the order that date and time parameters should have been dictated from the very start, but most countries unfortunately didn't think hard enough, and ended up with the year in third position, and the date and month in some arbitrary choice between the first two positions.  How ridiculous.\n\n\n*Save. Quit. Assign a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.  Done∗.  Here's the finished workflow:\n\n\n∗(Almost done) Whilst the keyboard shortcut you set via System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services should work in all appropriate situations, it seems to be buggy in web page text entry fields.  The menu option appears in the services menu, but without a shortcut seemingly assigned to trigger it. Therefore, create an additional shortcut via System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts > All Applications and assign it the same hotkey as the other.  Now it works.\n†Usually, editing a workflow and saving it will effect the changes more-or-less immediately so that it works outside the Automator environment, as you'd expect.  This isn't necessarily the case with the option to replace selected text, which can take quite some time or require a system reboot to work outside Automator.  Therefore, two things I advise you get correct to help avoid starting all over again are: 1) The name you wish your Quick Action/Service to have; and **2)**That you check the box to allow output to replace selected text. If something doesn't work, delete it all and start again.\n\nA: Extending @CJK's excellent answer, neither the ISO-8601 format nor the default Applescript one works for me, and I'm more comfortable programming in Javascript, so I came up with this:\n\nIf I were programming an app, I would momentjs to format the date, but for this personal Quick Action, it seemed more expedient to brute-force it. Anyway, I don't even know if you can import modules in JXA, seems unlikely.\n", "Q: How can I use a detached keyboard with my iPad Pro so I can draw and use quick keys with it flat?

Then, when I start it back up, I will get a Problem Report for macOS popup that says my computer restarted because of a problem. At first I assumed this was possibly related to the fact that I hadn't updated my macOS in far too long, so I updated to Catalina, but the issue keeps happening.\nI am including the error report here in the hopes someone smarter than me can help me figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.

The report you posted suggests it is a problem with a USB device, but it could be anything, really.\nI suggest running Apple Hardware Diagnostics (be sure to unplug all your USB devices etc. as it says in the instructions). If it fails, call Apple about getting your MacBook repaired. If it succeeds, run it a second time just to be sure.\nIf no hardware problems are found, then stop using your external drive and see if the panics stop. It might be the drive, or it might be the drive's power connector, or it might be the USB cable connecting the drive, or it might be some other USB device attached (like an external keyboard), or it could be something else entirely. It's pretty much trial and error if the hardware diagnostics do not turn up anything.\n", "Q: macbook 2016 21w charger replaced with 61watt I have a late 2016 macbook with a charger that fails often.  I bought one that I thought would work but am afraid to try it until I know for sure.They are both c chargers, but the original one is 29W and the new one is 61w. I think that using one with higher wattage is ok, am I right?\n\nA: From: Find the right power adapter and cable for your Mac notebook\n\nPower adapters for Mac notebooks are available in 29W, 30W, 45W, 60W,\n61W, 85W, 87W, and 96W varieties. You should use the appropriate\nwattage power adapter for your Mac notebook. You can use a compatible\nhigher wattage power adapter without issue, but it won't make your\ncomputer charge faster or operate differently.\n\nAlso:\n\nMake sure you're using the correct USB-C charge cable\nFor the best charging experience, you should use the USB-C charge\ncable that comes with your Mac notebook. If you use a higher wattage\nUSB-C cable, your Mac will still charge normally. USB-C cables rated\nfor 29W or 30W will work with any USB-C power adapter, but won't\nprovide enough power when connected to a power adapter that is more\nthan 61W, such as the 96W USB-C Power Adapter.\n\n", "Q: On mac, chrome is not centered, and shifted to the right. How to fix it? This is its behavior.\n\nAlso, I was able to maximize the window and see the screen properly. However, as soon I exit the maximized window, it shows the same issue again. Refreshing the page obviously does not help.\nAlso, if I open a new window, that window is also showing proper. Just every tabs in the previous window are messed up.\nHow to fix this behavior?\n\nA: It looks to me like it's \"not centered\" because your window is actually much wider than your display screen, and extends to the right of the screen. (I think you'll find that within the window, the display of the content actually is centered.) I have seen this on rare occasion. I don't know a fix that's elegant, but you should be able to fix it in this inelegant way: Click and drag the left edge of the window to reduce the width of the window; then, grab the window header to move the whole window back over to the left, hopefully revealing the right edge. If the window is still too wide, repeat the operation until it fits on your display screen. Then size the window to your preference.\n", "Q: Apple Music checkbox is disabled and greyed out in Music In the restrictions for Music, the Apple Music checkbox is disabled, and greyed out.\n\nThings I tried/checked:\n\n*\n\n*I am the administrator on this mac.\n\n*I'm signed in to iCloud on this computer.\n\n*I can sync my library to my Apple ID.\n\n*Restarting the computer\n\n*Restarting music\n\n\nA: I called Apple and they helped me in about 10 minutes, all you need to do is enable iTunes. For some reason, you need iTunes enabled to have Apple Music enabled.\n", "Q: How to get 1:1 scale in Keynote, Pages or Numbers? I was an early user of Mac last century; I remember Jobs telling about how the Plus had the only screen with square pixels and how important it was for developers a consistent info on pixel size so that they could give to the user an exact scale. That if an image was being shown 100% scale in the screen, one centimeter in the ruler should be a real centimeter.\nI think that this consistency was a key to win the field of graphic design.\nSo, I got a new 21.5 iMac some months ago and yesterday I discovered that the images I was sketching at 100% size were not the size I was seen in the screen. I enabled the ruler and measured it. Whoops, I need to set zoom at 150% to get a correct size, and even then it is a bit, sort if one hundredth part, inaccurate.\nTo my amazement, Preview does the 100% size right when showing pdfs, so the info on pixel size is available to developers... My guess is that I am missing some setting, is it?\nEDIT: LibreOffice also does the right scale, so it is something with the adjusts of AppleWorks applications. Er... iWorks.\n\nA: If you select 'Actual Size' (Command 0) under the View > Zoom menu, then the page should display at ... actual size.\nWith this setting, an A4 page on the screen is the same size as an A4 piece of paper that I hold in front of the screen. This works for Retina displays and non-Retina displays.\nBack in the old days, Mac screens had 72 pixels to the inch. So it was easy for 1 point on the page to equal 1 pixel on the screen. This ratio is what become 100% zoom.\nOf course, screen pixel density has increased massively since then. Pre-Retina displays were around 109 dpi. Retina screens are twice that, but scale everything up by 2, giving the same perceived resolution.\n109 dpi divided by 72 dpi gives you 151%, which is the zoom factor you get when you select 'Actual Size'.\n\nPreview has a Preference to define 100% as either 1 point = 1 pixel, or 'size on screen equals size on printout', which presumably sets 100% to the Actual Size.\n", "Q: How do I pack regions into a folder in Logic Pro X? The Apple help site says:\n\nSelect the regions, then choose Functions > Folder > Pack Folder from the Tracks area menu bar.\n\nHowever, there is no Folder tab under Functions, nor is there any command in the menu bar or edit dropdown that says \"Pack Folder.\"\nThis seems like a very simple thing, but I can't figure it out because following Apple's directions doesn't work. How do I pack and unpack folders?\nI'm using the most recent version of Logic Pro X, so the YouTube tutorials I've found are unhelpful as they are older versions in which the Help site directions still work.\n\nA: This got answered on another site, but I figure I might was well share it here:\nPreferences > Advanced Tools... > Show Advanced Tools\nmakes the option available. Why organizing with folders is an advanced tool is beyond me, but that's a discussion for another day.\n", "Q: My 2014 MacBook Pro is not able run external monitor at high refreshrate I recently bought a Acer 2K 144Hz monitor to pair with my 2013 Retina MacBook pro. I am connecting the monitor to the MBP via Thunderbolt port to DisplayPort cable. As far as I know, my MBP should  support Thunderbolt 2, which should be able to drive the monitor at 2K 144Hz.\nEven though I do see the monitor running at 2560x1440 resolution, I see the refresh rate is only 60Hz. Going to the display settings, the refresh rate option is greyed out and is set at 60hz.\nAny pointers on what could be the issue here? Could it be caused by a faulty Thunderbolt to DP cable?\n\nA: There is no issue, 60Hz is the highest refresh.\nAccording to the official specifications, that model Mac has a refresh rate of (HDMI)\n\n*\n\n*Support for 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz\n\n*Support for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz\n\n*Support for 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz\n\nAs for DisplayPort, the released standard for  DisplayPort at the time this Mac was released, was 1.2a.  The maximum resolution and refresh rate was 4K (3840x2160 @ 75Hz) or 5K (5180x2880@ 30Hz).  That doesn’t mean Apple “enabled” those resolutions/refresh rates. They’ve been known to “cripple” features like daisy-chaining which was possible with DP 1.2 but not possible with the MacBook Pro.\nThe cable may be able to support the bandwidth but, more importantly, the graphics chip must be able to drive that frequency.\n\nA: There is a software ceiling that does not allow Macs to push out a higher refresh rate. So even if you have a monitor that supports a much higher refresh rate, say 240 Hz, the Mac will still output 60 Hz cause the MacOS sets the limit there. I am only aware that this is the case with MBP and MBAir, so I wont comment on other devises. And therefore there's probably nothing wrong with the cable unless it fails elsewhere too. Good luck, hope this helps.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) running Mojave (10.14.3 (18D42)) is does not recognize external boot drive I just got a new Macbook Pro, I was previously using an MBP (13-inch, Mid 2012) running Mojave. I have a 1TB SSD that has a partition with a Windows 10 installation (I followed this tutorial: https://blog.macsales.com/40947-tech-tip-how-to-use-boot-camp-on-an-external-drive/) and another MacOS Journaled partition that I use for general file storage. This setup has worked for me on my old MBP (I can hold option to boot into windows). However, the Startup Manager does not recognize my external drive and only display my internal drive. Using System Preferences startup disk leads to this error: The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk. I've tried resetting NVRAM as well.\nHere is some disk information that may help:\n$ diskutil list\n\n...\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:               Windows_NTFS BOOTCAMP                353.1 GB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS VECTOTECHS              671.1 GB   disk2s2\n\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk2\nDisk: /dev/disk2    geometry: 124519/255/63 [2000409264 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*1: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         2 -  689689262] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 689690624 - 1310715904] HFS+\n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused\n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused\n\nMy guess is that I need an EFI partition for the newer mac to recognize my drive. Would this entail restarting the entire installation process? Any information would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nA: Your guess is correct. The 2017 model Macs can only EFI boot Windows. Since the first partition on the external drive starts at sector 2, the drive does not have the space to convert from a MBR partition table scheme to a GUID partition table (GPT) scheme. This means you would need to restart the installation process.\nWhen installing Windows 10, I would recommend you do not use VirtualBox. This recommendation is based on the fact that the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft and the Windows Support Software from Apple contains all the software required to install Windows 10 to your external drive. Therefore, there is no need to use a third party product such as VirtualBox.\n\nThe use of a virtual machine to install Windows dates to when Mac owners removed the optical drive so another HDD or SSD drive could installed in their Mac. After the optical drive was removed, often an owner would discover the Windows 10 installer could not be booted from a flash drive. This led to the use of a virtual machine as the only way to install Windows other than change the hardware configuration.\n\nSince you model Mac can EFI boot from either an internal or external drive, you do not need to use a virtual machine. However, if you wish, a virtual machine can also be used. Below are some references to previously posted methods for installing Windows 10 on an external drive.\nDrivers not working on Windows 10 installed (CLI process) on external SSD running on Macbook\nIs it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?\nHow can I copy the drivers provided by Apple when installing Bootcamp on an external drive?\n", "Q: Why can't I see subscript \"s\" (Unicode Character “ₛ” (U+209B)) even though I can see lots of other unicode characters?

Apple doesn't provide fonts for all 130000 unicode characters.  For U+209b you need to download one.  A possible list is here.\nAnd a font that can be used as a source for installing these glyphs is here: https://dejavu-fonts.github.io\n", "Q: Purchased TV Show will not play - Screen stays black and progress bar won't move I'll start this with saying that the following question is relevant, but the answer didn't solve the problem for me:\n\n*\n\n*A purchased and downloaded iTunes television show will not play\nI'm running iTunes Version 12.10.7 12.10.8.5, which is the most recent version at the time of writing this on Windows 10. I bought and downloaded the latest season of Doctor Who two days ago.\nInitially I had trouble downloading some of the episodes, with error 2072 being thrown in the process. The solution I found online (deleting the Downloads folder in iTunes Media and letting iTunes recreate it) worked to solve this problem and I could download the episodes.\nNow they are on my device and I'd like to play them, but the episodes that showed me that error while downloading can't be played now. Starting them opens the player window and displays progress bar and control buttons, but the screen stays black and the progress bar doesn't move.\nOther episodes that didn't have this problem downloading are playing fine.\nI've tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*Delete and re-download the broken episodes\n\n\n*Delete the broken episodes and re-add them from my device\n\n\n*Check for updates on iTunes and my device (there were none)\n\n\n*Restart iTunes as well as my device.\n\n\n*Check if my device is authorized to play my purchases (it is, otherwise the other episodes of the season wouldn't work either, i guess)\n\n\n*[UPDATE] I also tried downloading the episodes to my iPad (where they do play) and transferring them to my PC from there. However, as soon as they are on my PC, iTunes refuses yet again to play them. This sounds to me like a library corruption. I think I'll try to rebuild it next.\n\n\n*[UPDATE 2] After literally spending hours rebuilding my library (even with exporting and re-importing my old one as xml) it worked for a bit. Right until I closed iTunes and reopened it a while later. Then it got much worse: Now all TV shows that I purchased from the iTunes store either won't play at all or have no sound when they do.\n\n\n*[UPDATE 3] After I did that, I tried completely uninstalling and re-installing iTunes, completely with emptying out my library again. Took me some hours to get everything back up and lo and behold: No changes whatsoever. No TV shows that I bought on the iTunes store can be watched, neither downloaded ones, nor on stream.\n\n\n*[STILL UPDATE 3] I've also unauthorized every device linked to my account and re-authorized my computer. Didn't work either.\n\nA: It could be many things from a missing video codec, to a corrupted iTunes/Quicktime installation, to an old video driver or hardware acceleration on the video driver.\nFind a video that doesn't play that you have purchased already. Don't use rentals or streams.  This gives you a baseline to test without incurring additional costs.\nMake one change at a time then test iTunes with the known troublesome video.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Windows is up to date run Check for Updates.\n\n*Go to your computer manufacturers support web page look up your model and check the video driver version verses the one you see in Device Manager. Upgrade it if it is not the latest version. Some vendors provide tools to make this easier. These tools help you keep your drivers up to date, run such a tool as an alternative option.\n\n*Turn off Hardware Acceleration (Display Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Troubleshoot -> Reduce Hardware Acceleration)\n\n*Run Disk Cleanup to clear your Temporary folders.\n\n*Run virus/malware scans.\n\n*Run a Disk Check (Right-click drive -> Properties -> Tools -> Check)\n\n*Delete & Re-download the purchased content\n\n*Follow this Apple Support guide to completely uninstall, re-install iTunes on Windows. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204275 Also uninstall Quicktime if you have that installed.\n\nIt's possible that Apple had technical difficulties, some people report a video that had a black screen working properly at a later date with no changes made on their part.\nYou can actually report the problem and possibly request a refund from Apple for those rentals that didn't work. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084\n", "Q: MBP 2012 restarts at times for no reason I have this crash coming up lately...any ideas?\nFYI, I do have two different RAMs 1x2gb 1x4gb different manufacturer.\nmp_kdp_enter() timed-out on cpu 0, NMI-ing\nmp_kdp_enter() NMI pending on cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nmp_kdp_enter() timed-out during locked wait after NMI;expected 8 acks but received 1 after 69874 loops in 1147385509 ticks\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800464aa3a): Kernel trap at 0xffffff80044c549f, type 14=page fault, registers:\nCR0: 0x000000008001003b, CR2: 0x000000000000009f, CR3: 0x0000000009b97000, CR4: 0x00000000001626e0\nRAX: 0xffffff800501cb28, RBX: 0xffffff8015153d80, RCX: 0x00000000000000f6, RDX: 0xffffffffffffffff\nRSP: 0xffffff8ceefbb570, RBP: 0xffffff8ceefbbd80, RSI: 0x0000000000000007, RDI: 0xffffff8015711540\nR8:  0xffffff8015806800, R9:  0x000005beb8db3a83, R10: 0x0000000000000015, R11: 0x0000000009b97000\nR12: 0x00000000a13a59a0, R13: 0xffffff8014fa31c0, R14: 0x0000000000000007, R15: 0x000000000000000b\nRFL: 0x0000000000010082, RIP: 0xffffff80044c549f, CS:  0x0000000000000008, SS:  0x0000000000000010\nFault CR2: 0x000000000000009f, Error code: 0x0000000000000002, Fault CPU: 0x0, PL: 1, VF: 5\n\nBacktrace (CPU 0), Frame : Return Address\n0xffffff8ceefbafd0 : 0xffffff800451f5cd \n0xffffff8ceefbb020 : 0xffffff8004658b05 \n0xffffff8ceefbb060 : 0xffffff800464a68e \n0xffffff8ceefbb0b0 : 0xffffff80044c5a40 \n0xffffff8ceefbb0d0 : 0xffffff800451ec97 \n0xffffff8ceefbb1d0 : 0xffffff800451f087 \n0xffffff8ceefbb220 : 0xffffff8004cc27cc \n0xffffff8ceefbb290 : 0xffffff800464aa3a \n0xffffff8ceefbb410 : 0xffffff800464a738 \n0xffffff8ceefbb460 : 0xffffff80044c5a40 \n0xffffff8ceefbb480 : 0xffffff80044c549f \n0xffffff8ceefbbd80 : 0xffffff7f879a56d3 \n0xffffff8ceefbbe60 : 0xffffff7f879a4a4a \n0xffffff8ceefbbf20 : 0xffffff800464c60a \n0xffffff8ceefbbf40 : 0xffffff80045446c7 \n0xffffff8ceefbbf80 : 0xffffff8004544888 \n0xffffff8ceefbbfa0 : 0xffffff80044c513e \n      Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\n         com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement(222.0)[754827F6-D42B-3311-815E-C3A9E312BEC1]@0xffffff7f879a2000->0xffffff7f879cbfff\n\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: kernel_task\n\nMac OS version:\n19F101\n\nKernel version:\nDarwin Kernel Version 19.5.0: Tue May 26 20:41:44 PDT 2020;

I say that because the SMC manages the power, sleep/wake, etc. and you have that AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement being referenced in the log.  It's worth a try first.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\nIt very well could be the RAM. Especially since you've added 3rd party RAM to the system. Mac's have always been picky about RAM since forever. PC motherboards are more forgiving on RAM while Apple has tighter expectations. Even though the RAM may pass x86memtest aggressive scans it might have a slight timing issue that crashes the Mac. Also, mixing different RAM sizes is not recommended. Each of the RAM memory modules should be exactly the same, a matched pair.\nRemove whatever 3rd party RAM that you added and see if the panics cease to occur.\nThe cost of upgrading to 16GB or RAM is under $100 USD for high quality name brand memory.  If the problem goes away when you remove the 3rd party RAM consider replacing both memory SODIMM's with two 8GB ones. It will help with improving performance on your MBP 2012.\nIf you don't currently have an SSD, consider installing one as that will help even more for performance and the cost has dropped considerably for 2.5\" SSDs. You don't specify which MBP 2012 you have and there are four models from 2012 between 13\" & 15\". But since the MBP Retina 2012 models have the RAM soldered to the system board that means you must have the 2012 model without the Retina screen.  Therefore 2.5\" HDD or SSD.\nYou should be able to get another couple years out of it but you won't be able to upgrade to Big Sur. After about 2-4 years you will run into software applications no longer being supported on Catalina. Perhaps sooner because of the CPU architecture changes coming soon.\nBut the good news is by late 2021 to 2022 would be an excellent time to buy a new Mac as the new Apple Silicon should be shipping a model or two end of 2020 and 2021 into 2022 refreshing the entire line-up to use Apple's new processors.  Early indications are impressive to say the least.\nIf you are on a tight budget see if you can find a newer used MacBook Pro. Big Sur will run on any MBP from Late 2013 and up. A MBP 2015 or up would give you a few more years.  Typically Apple removes hardware support at approximately 7 years of age. It is not always the case but more often than not that is how it works out. As you get closer to 10 years more and more software will not work. With all the massive change developers are going through with the Apple Silicon transition that might mean that developers will drop support for older systems sooner rather than later.\n", "Q: iPhone FaceID stopped working after 13.5 update––is this a bug or hdw failure? So here's the story...\nMy iPhone X was working just fine on 13.4.x. Then a couple weeks ago I updated to 13.5.1 because of the rumored FaceID w/Mask unlock. Everything seemed to be working fine––but I think I got so used to typing passcodes I didn't notice if FaceID ever worked after the update.\nWhen I finally realized something was wrong with FaceID, I did the usual: soft reset, FaceID reset, and then finally, factory reset. Nothing worked, and once I reset FaceID, I could never \"Set up Face ID\" again. Every attempt left me with the \"move the phone higher/lower\" bug.\nSince then, I've also updated to 13.6 with no change in FaceID. After reading more than a few pages on the web, I've got the following diagnosis:\niPhone X FaceID checklist:\n\n*\n\n*Proximity sensor/AutoBrightness OK\n\n*Animoji OK\n\n*Selfie camera portrait-mode does NOT work, “move farther away” msg, no background blur\n\n*Rear camera portrait mode OK\n\n\"Set up Face ID\"\n\n*\n\n*shows \"position your face within the frame\" or \"move iPhone a little higher/lower\"\n\nCan someone help me determine if this is 1) a software bug or 2) a fatal hardware failure that coincidentally emerged within days of upgrading to 13.5.1?\n\nA: May vote is neither.\nIt’s not a software bug in that release - we would have floods and floods of people with issues if there were a bug breaking FaceID.\nIt’s not likely a coincidental hardware failure. Of course if you suspect that seek hardware service immediately.\nIt’s much more likely some general corruption on the combination of your software, your apps, your data and the device. The steps to troubleshoot that would be to get a good backup, erase all settings and content, set up FaceID alone before you restore any data. If that doesn’t work, then restore the device entirely from a computer. Repeat the “set up nothing except FaceID” test.\nBased on that you may have hardware - seek service knowing you have a backup.\nOr you may find the hardware and software work, then decide to erase and try restoring your backup or just setting up new.\n", "Q: How to solve Mac Apple Store repeatedly prompting for Apple ID and password?

I logged out and I logged in with my Apple ID.\nI urgently need to be able to develop for iOS 13, and for this reason, I need to update XCode to the latest version. When I open the Apple Store it starts prompting for Apple ID and password, and the Apple ID field is automatically filled with the previous Apple ID, the one I signed out. If I type my Apple ID and my password in place of that, after 30 seconds it prompts again for the same information, in the same way.\nI've tried a lot of tricks, all the ones that came out when you google for this problem. But none of them helped. I tried signing out, restarting, enabling two factors authentication, removing the password prompt in the settings, but nothing made any difference.\nThe only thing I didn't try was putting a valid credit card in the payment settings of my Apple ID. The credit card I had inserted time ago expired, and I don't want to insert any credit card info on a shared computer. Furthermore, I just want to update a free app and I don't think there are no alternatives.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The version of Xcode - & everything else that was already on the Mac when you got it, including the OS itself - doesn't strictly belong to you. It belongs to the Apple ID that originally 'purchased' it, even if that purchase was free.\nApp & OS ownership is not transferrable.\nUnless your company runs an MDM solution allowing it to properly manage company-purchased apps, then the simplest solution is to wipe the entire machine & start afresh. That way everything then 'belongs' to you.\nThe Mac also needs to be released from the Find My & entire iCloud structure too.\nSee Apple KB - What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac for a comprehensive guide.\nAs it's a corporate Mac, you'd be best to speak to your IT department before going at this single-handed, as it will likely require the compliance of the previous user.\n", "Q: Use laptop keyboard as an external keyboard for my ipad I just bought a new ipad amidst the lockdown and i just can't get hold of the keyboard for it\nIs there any way i can use my old laptop's keyboard and mouse with the ipad (pro 2020)\n\nA: The 1Keyboard app allows you to use your Mac keyboard to control an iPad or iPhone. It's great app that I have used for years on both devices. It doesn't allow you to use the a mouse or trackpad, though, but for typing it works flawlessly. (Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with the app maker.)\n\nA: There are wireless Bluetooth keyboards that work fine with an iPad. I purchased one from an online shopping site for $19 for my iPad Pro. I've read that practically any Bluetooth keyboard will work but I would opt for one that explicitly says compatible with an ipad. Mine is an Omoton wireless keyboard and its easy to connect and works great.\n", "Q: Should important files in iCloud also be backed up elsewhere? It is commonly accepted that any files stored on a personal external hard drive should also be backed up elsewhere (in at least one other drive/location) since external drives can and do fail and having >=2 copies greatly reduces the chances of important data being lost.\nIs the same measure necessary for important files stored in iCloud?\nKnowing that any large company's 'cloud' storage would likely be much better and safer than someone's personal external hard drive helps, but are they still susceptible to failure? Do files get backed up within iCloud, that is, are there multiple copies of the files in iCloud in case any one of Apple's datacenters gets destroyed?\nThe basic question I am trying to answer is: is storing important files in iCloud enough, or should the extra precaution of storing important files elsewhere (e.g. google drive, an external hard disk, etc) also be taken?\n\nA: Yes. I have one mac that I set to download originals - no optimizing space. This way I have a guaranteed local copy of my Music (formerly iTunes) Library and content, my Photos (formerly iPhoto) Library and content and all containers and app-data and files stored in iCloud.\nI back these up to Time Machine. I have two drives that Time Machine backs up to - one that’s connected for 3 months and another that’s off-site. Each quarter, I disconnect the drive that’s online and swap it out with the off-site one that comes back and stays connected for the new quarter.\nI limit my lossage to the new files only should I lose both iCloud and my home to a fire or accident.\nI know some other people use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner or Arq but I haven’t needed these excellent tools for personal use (I use each of the above professionally and can vouch for how well engineered they are - spend money with one of them if you don’t trust Time Machine).\nHere are my truths:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud is not a backup I trust for irreplaceable items like photos, legal documents, important files.\n\n*RAID is not a backup for anything\n\n*I’m more likely to mess up than Apple is. I am primarily protecting me against myself losing control of my account or messing up.\n\n*I gladly outsource backup tools to the professionals (just like I outsource music syncing and photo syncing to Apple).\n\nEvery time the bill comes due, I have a drink and appreciate I’m not spending hours fixing my hacked together scripts to back up or sync. I’m then refreshed to earn more than enough money to pay someone to manage these tasks for me. The time I save is way more valuable than the cost of one time backup service or $13 a month to Apple for iCloud storage and music service.\n\nA: The new paradigm is…\n\"Any data which is stored in fewer than three distinct locations ought to be considered temporary.\"\nLate Edit:\nDon't use a sync solution as a backup.\niCloud is not primarily a backup solution, it is a sync solution. It will come back to bite you hard if you accidentally delete a file from one device… the helpful sync service will then dutifully delete it from every device.\nFor 'distinct locations', personally, I use 4, in degrees of 'distance'.\n\n*\n\n*My Mac, which has not only my Mac data but also my iDevice backups.\n\n*Time Machine, containing all of 1.\n\n1 & 2 are both in the same building, so if the house burns down, I need another location, off-site.\n\n\n*iCloud, containing only a subset of 1 & 2 [primarily iPhone backups, just because they happen automatically] which is not enough to recover everything in case of disaster.\n\n\n*Backblaze [other offsite backup structures are available] which has copies of everything in 1, 2, & 3 above.\nI also have my boot drive cloned, for rapid recovery in case of drive failure, but that is also in the house, so classes as part of 1 & 2.\nI consider iCloud to contain my keychain in case of catastrophe. I don't consider it as any kind of 'storage', per se. I don't trust it with my photos or my music, for instance, I have all that data stored in 1, the Mac. I consider my Mac to be the primary location for all my data. It has 13TB of storage & nearly 20 years of unbroken historical data.\n\nA: iCloud is not a backup. It is a synchronization service.\nThere is a fundamental difference between the two. When you accidentally delete a file, then\n\n*\n\n*a backup makes sure that you can restore the file again, whereas\n\n*a synchronization service makes sure that you can never again restore the file because it synchronizes the deletion event everwhere.\n\nAs you can see, this makes the synchronization service in some sense the exact opposite of a backup.\nThe same applies to RAID, by the way.\n\nA: While I don't want to labor the points already made, I do believe it should be called out that \"accidental deletion\" is not the only failure mode that can ruin your iCloud \"backup\" (i.e., sync).  Other possible failures, due to iCloud sync'ing and not maintaining a fully \"independent\" (i.e., non-local), \"distinct\" (i.e., non-synchronized), \"time-dated\" (i.e., snapshot) copy of your data are:\n\n*\n\n*Ransomware will ruin your day: the iCloud \"copy\" will be encrypted along with your (local) data.  Note that this can also be ruin a snapshot service if there is insufficient excess capacity to hold at least 2x the capacity of your data.  Without sufficient excess capacity, encrypted data will overwrite old snapshots (indeed possibly all your snapshots).\n\n\n*Multiple device synchronization can be a foul up: iCloud can and does have issues if a device has been offline for an extended period of time and is then re-introduced to synchronization.  It can and does attempt to \"add\" the old data to the latest data.  I've seen it, it isn't pretty.\nNote: iCloud could be significantly improved if it would provide synchronization of a Time Machine backup-- especially if the Time Machine backup were made to separate, write-once (\"WORM\") media.\n", "Q: How can I change the colour matching option in the Default Settings printer preset? Specifically, I want to change the colour matching for my Canon Pixma G3500 from Canon Color Matching to ColorSync.\nWhen editing using the GUI, the Default Settings, and Draft Printing on Plain Paper and Fine Printing on Plain Paper can't be saved over or deleted.\nI know how to create custom settings but ideally I would like to change the defaults to avoid accidental wasted prints in future, because the custom settings appear lower down the drop-down menu so could be missed if printing in haste or when tired.\nI searched plist files in /Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Preferences/ but drew a blank.\n\nA: You can't change the Default Settings print preset, but if you make a new Preset, and print with it, then MacOS normally offers the same preset again, the next time you print.\nIn earlier versions of MacOS, if you held down Option when you pressed OK in the Print menu, the settings would be saved as the default, but that doesn't seem necessary now. You could try it if it isn't working.\nYou can change the defaults of the printer by accessing the CUPS web interface, but that doesn't always include ColorSync options.\nThe first time you try this, you need to enable the CUPS web interface. In Terminal, type cupsctl WebInterface=yes\nIn a web browser, go to http://localhost:631\nThen you'll see the CUPS controls. Click on \"Printers\" in the bar along the top.

Now I'm trying to play games that don't work in a VM and want it back.\nBootcamp is failing to create the partition and corrupting the APFS container as it unwinds. Actually, it's creating the partitions but gacking at some point. The question above has the fsck_apfs commands I've been looking for, but I'm looking beyond that.\nWhat if, prior to reloading, I created the APFS container AND a smaller HPS/NTFS/FAT32 partition for Bootcamp Assistant to use? A \"sacrifice\" disk if you will.\nDoes it matter if the partition is created first, in the first sectors of the drive or at the end behind the APFS container?\nThis time, I plan to only do a MacOS install and not a recovery to test if this works. If so, I'll either restore directly to it or blow everything away again and do a full restore from the ground up with the extra partition.\n\nA: My issue turned out to be Fusion drive issues that necessitated doing a diskutil resetFusion and blowing EVERYTHING away, recreate the APFS container, and reload. Painful, but I now have a Windows partition running. And yes, Bootcamp Assistant totally ignored everything but the APFS container.\nClosest thing I could find to my issue: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207584\n", "Q: Install a package .pkg into a custom directory I need to install the gcc3.3 on my OS X 10.5.8 to try something. For that purpose, I need to install it into a custom directory, such as /usr/loca/gcc-3.3\nBy default, the gcc3.3.pkg installs itself directly into /usr/bin To change that default directory, I've tried this command line:\nsudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/gcc3.3.pkg -target /usr/local/gcc-3.3\n\nbut that didn't work and the installer installed it into /usr/bin\nSo how can I install a .pkg into a custom directory?\n\nA: Try unpkg. It has  worked flawlessly for me for several years.\nunpkg solves the problem of installing a .pkg outside its intended location. You still have to figure out how to run gcc from that location. I assume it's a matter of setting the correct environment variables or setting symbolic links in /usr/local .\n\nA: You cannot redirect the target on this package. Per the installer manpage the target is a device node entry such as /dev/disk*, disk ID disk1s9, a volume mount point /Volumes/Untitled, or a volume UUID. When I tried to change the target it wouldn't allow it to be changed.\nThe gcc3.3.pkg is a standard Apple Pkg format so right-click and Show Package Contents. Then all you have to do is \"tar zxvf Archive.pax.gz\" somewhere and Bob's Your Uncle. There are the files you want.\nYou could then repackage it how you wish for future use or you can just copy the files where you want them and try that.\n\nA: I checked the man page ( run man installer) and -target can only specify volume, like the examples given on the man page. It doesn't accept a custom install directory.\nSo you may make a new volume or a dmg with double or triple the size of .pkg & install gcc there. Use Disk Utility to achieve this, or if you have a writable DMG, then use that. Don't make a partition, \"Create Volume\" instead. Use either of the following afterwards.\ninstaller -pkg InstallMe.pkg -target /dev/disk2\ninstaller -pkg InstallMe.pkg -target /Volumes/my_gcc_vol\n\nWhere /dev/disk2 is what you can find by running diskutil list.\n\nA: Several of the scripts for things like compiling and running GCC assumes the GCC app being in the /usr/bin directory and installing it elsewhere may require other scripts being rewritten or being run manually and/or your path being updated. Unless you have a compelling reason to put it in a custom directory I'd install it wherever it wants.\n", "Q: The letter O on my MacBook no longer works I no longer get any functionality when typing the letter O of my mid-2015 MacBook Pro.\nHow can I troubleshoot this?\n\nA: If the problem is due to debris under the key cap you can use compressed air to blow under the O keycap.  If that doesn't fix it then you'll need to replace the entire keyboard.  There are guides and instructions on ifixit.com.  It would mean completely removing everything to get to the keyboard underneath. The keyboard itself is low cost.

I want to create a secret provisioning systems that on deployment decrypts secrets on the target machine and put them in RAM.

Does this ramdisk get swapped to the disk by the operating system (which would put the secret data on disk)?\n\nA: Since macOS High Sierra 10.13.x the virtual memory \"swapfile(s)\" have been encrypted even if FileVault2 disk encryption is off.  Obviously, I would test that theory and review any CVE reports and validate it.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-secure-virtual-memory-on-mac-mh11852/mac\nYou might be scratching your left ear with your right hand roundabout the hard way.

I have three partitions on the drive, one (really two, Data and System) for macOS, one for Bootcamp, and one for Shared files.\nI am running macOS 11 Big Sur Developer Beta 1 as of now. I saw an available update today for what I assume to be the public beta. I downloaded the 12 GB .app installer, and once I got to the 'select a drive' phase, all three partitions were grayed out with the error:\nThis disk has S.M.A.R.T. errors. The popup (in an attached screenshot) specified that this was a hardware issue, although the drive is less than a month old.\nBefore everyone renounces me for even thinking of installing the developer beta on my mac (I do understand how incredibly buggy macOS betas are), I want to assure all the veterans this is not my main machine, although I do use it for application development and various other uses.

insert boot disk and press any key I inserted Mountain Lion on an iMac A1225 having new formatted HDD. When I boot holding the ⌥ Option, it shows Mountain Lion (install disk) as option. When I press enter-key to confirm, it came with \"no bootable device\" but if I boot holding \"C\" it boot Mountain Lion normally. Now with the new OS installed, the iMac still gives \"no bootable device\" at start up\n\nA: If you can get Lion to boot you can go to the Startup Disk in System Preferences and select the internal disk. Maybe it in Recovery Mode if it won’t boot.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202796\nBasically does this under the hood.\nTo bless a volume with only macOS or Darwin, and create the BootX and boot.efi files as needed:\nbless --folder \"/Volumes/Mac OS X/System/Library/CoreServices\" --bootinfo --bootefi\n", "Q: How does a 4K Retina display 'double up' the pixels? I did the following experiment on a 21.5 retina display:\nOpen Pages, and write some lines with Courier New at point size 4, 3, 2 and even 1.\nUse default screen 2K High Resolution and then set view to Actual Size\nUse extreme 4K Resolution and again set view to Actual Size.\nThe typefaces with 3 and 2 points are readable in both modes, but they seem better in 4K. How is this?\nI mean, is not \"2K Retina\" supposed to present a default resolution of 2K but render objects at 4K? Just to be sure, \"2K low resolution\" seems to have a worse rendering of the 4, 3 and 2 typefaces. But 4K seems the winner. It is just my bias, or is it a fact that it renders better than 2K?\n\nA: On older displays, the pixels were sufficiently large that you could see each one on the screen.\nNewer displays have smaller pixels, which gives a sharper, less 'blocky' image. Eventually, displays' pixels became so small, and so densely packed that the human eye cannot distinguish individual pixels from a standard distance. (That's why the term 'Retina' is used.)\nThe problem with such high-density displays is that text is also reduced in size, appearing very small, and difficult to read.\nApple solved this with its 'Retina display' screen rendering. What it does is to take a high-density  (HiDPI) display and magnify everything by a factor of 2. So an image that would have been displayed using 512 x 512 pixels will actually be displayed using 1024 x 1024 pixels. The image stays sharp because the 2x2 square that represents \"1 pixel\" can actually have different colors in each pixel.\nSo by pretending the display is half the size, you get 'normal'-sized images and text, but with twice the fine detail. I would recommend using the Default scaling for most purposes. You can of course zoom in and out in Safari, Pages, Preview, etc.\n\nA: Apple has used scaled vector shapes to draw things on printers and screens since the original days of Macintosh. Fonts and Typefaces, Adobe Illustrator and other uses are programmed and supported for quite a while.\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display\nThis was renewed when retina displays came out with too many pixels for apps that didn’t contemplate a screen as dense dots. Rather than break these apps, Apple enhanced code and libraries to not preserve 1:1 pixel spacing or elements like icons and text that would render as minuscule at best. The OS has code to load 2x and 3x size images and scale them appropriately so that you get all the details of a 5k / 4k or just Retina display so that as you noticed, Apple is able to get use of all the pixels you throw at your screen while also keeping application spacing and text and lines readable.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/icons-and-images/image-size-and-resolution/\nOn other OS, you might have a less nuanced model in many cases and people have to down scale the resolution as the only lever to change text sizes and on screen icons for apps not willing to do that lifting themselves. By drawing paths and correctly substituting in high fidelity icons and images, the result is precise details, better curves and appropriate sizing than you might expect from the “resoltion” you see scaled in Display Preferences on macOS. Elements don’t change on-screen size even though the sharpness does render with 4k to 8k displays like the Pro Display XDR.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get the app icon of a built-in app on iOS? I would like to get an iOS app icon from a built in app, like Settings, ideally not including the app icon mask.\nOn macOS you can select the app in Finder, choose Get Info, click the icon, copy it to the clipboard, then paste it into Preview for example to get a 1024x1024 png. Is there a way to achieve the same thing but for iOS apps even ones that are built in?\n\nA: In a word, no.\nNot on iOS as there is no way to get to that particular icon without jailbreaking the device.\nHowever there are 3rd-party tools (iMazing is one of them) that allow you to copy apps from the phone to the Mac and explore the filesystem on the phone.\nNot sure if they will give you what you want but I do believe that the apps that do this have demo modes that will let you find out.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to quicksave Tomb Raider II Usually, with the Aspyr Media version of Tomb Raider II on MacOS (newest version), you save game with\n\nFn+F5\n\nand load game with\n\nFn+F6\n\non the Macbook Pro 2016.\nHowever, this frustratingly overlaps with the voice control when you press\n\nFn\n\nIs there a way to set a shortcut key which, when in the game, will shortcut Fn+F5 (for example, just pressing F5)?

Backups exist so you are free to clear things knowing you can get them back if you find out later some specific program actually needs them where they are.\nExamining the files like this you have some clues that often will let you refine what caused them to be there:\n\n*\n\n*What permissions / ownership is on the files?\n\n*What are the created dates, last modified dates?\n\n*Can you catch it with lsof or fs_usage (both of which are covered here on site pretty well on how to check for what process has a file open and which process reads / modifies / writes to a file)\n\n*Open terminal and use the file command to actually inspect the contents. Open them in an editor or a great free program like BBEdit to look at them safely. (Type file and a space and then drag one or two of the curious file icons into the terminal window and press return)\n\nWhat’s clear, is it’s not a program that behaves at all like a mac program and puts application files where they belong in user or system libraries. I would focus on things that are cross-platform or open-source as that’s a typical pattern to shard data to directories that are named algorithmically (Apple does this in /private/var/folders) as well - but hides that away from where people expect properly curated files to exist.\n\nA: You asked about tools to explore persistently installed apps.

Fix? I am the original owner of a mid-2012 MacBook Pro, which is currently running 10.14.6. On it I am running VMware Fusion 11.5.5. I created a VM of OSX 10.11 El Capitan so I could help a relative who uses it.\nI do not want to use my personal iCloud account on this VM so I created a new Apple account, validated it, and it now works on a spare iPad. Let's call it my \"Test Apple Account\".\nWhen the 10.11 installation on the VM reached the point where it asked for Apple Credentials to set up iCloud, et al, I enter the Test Apple Account ID and password, received an approval request on the spare iPad, allowed it, entered the 6-digit code, things were looking good, and then the following dialog box appeared.\n\nI entered the password I always use to sign into this MacBook Pro and after several seconds red text appeared in this dialog box saying it's the wrong password. I tried a couple more times thinking I was misspelling it and now that account is supposedly locked for 24 hours.\nI've seen a few forum posts on the Interwebs about this issue but they all veer off on sidetracks, including one on the SuperUser forum. My application is about as clear cut and legal as it gets.\nSuggestions?\nBTW, as a test I used the same Test Apple Account for setting up iCloud in another User account on this MacBook Pro. It worked fine. So what's different about this attempt to sign in to iCloud is that it's on an OSX 10.11 VM in Fusion stead of a 10.14 meatspace MacBook Pro.\nHmm. I wonder if I should be running the VM from that account? I'll check that and report back.\n\nA: This is a new authentication method. It really doesn’t have anything to do with your app or your VM - Apple is using another trusted device to prove you’re in control of the sign in request.\nThis all started around April 2017:\n\n*\n\n*iPhone asks for Mac password (or Mac asks for iOS password)\n\nA: It does get a bit confusing setting up a new device.\nDid you clone a machine to create this VM, or did you create it from scratch? If you cloned it, you could be having some issues about duplicate identifiers.\nIf you installed this from scratch, it is important to note that the password request is unusual. It is not asking for the iCloud password or the password to the computer (VM) you are using. It is asking for the password to a different computer that is using the same Apple ID. It is doing this to establish trust between this computer and the other one, thereby allowing the other computer to transfer secrets (like your iCloud keychain) to this new computer in a way that Apple never gets to know the secrets.\nSo pay particular attention to the name of the computer it is asking for the password for. If you have more than one computer with that name, change the name of the other computer(s) using this same Test ID so they are all unique and you know which password to enter.\nThe password to enter is the password for the user using the Test Apple ID on the named computer.\nAlso be sure you have iTunes 12.3 or later installed. Somehow iTunes is involved in the multi-factor authentication.\nOption 2\nThe other thing you can do, and in your case you might find it easier and acceptable since this is just a Test Account, is you click on the \"Forgot MacBook Pro password\" link. It will ask you for the password to a different device, if you have one, until it runs out of devices, at which point it will give you the option to delete all the secrets from your iCloud account. Do that, and now the VM will be the one that needs to authorize the other devices.\n", "Q: bluetoothd 100% CPU + can't turn off Bluetooth: My bluetoothd process is hitting 100% CPU on my 2013 MacBook Pro.\nI have no bluetooth devices.

Reinstalling High Sierra alone never fixed the problem.

I have two MacBook Pro laptops, a 13\" 2012 and a 15\" 2019. I want to get an external monitor.\nI tried using the Dell 2410 and the BenQ GW2480 external monitors.  Both monitors were too bright with either of my MacBooks in my bedroom even when the monitors were set to minimum brightness.\nDo MacBooks make external monitors brighter than Windows laptops, or does a monitor's brightness have nothing to do with the type of computer?\n\nA: The range of brightness of a monitor is dependent on what the manufacturer designed and is irrelevant to the computer (Macs and PCs) attached to them.\nLumens or Units of Visible Light\nThe amount of lumens a display puts out (how dim and bright it goes) is totally dependent on how the manufacturer designed and built it.  For simplicity, think of it like the \"volume\" control for audio, but instead of sound, it handles light.  The fact that it doesn't go to \"zero\" (or low enough for your particular needs) is due to the design - there may be a technical reason like the LEDs that the manufacturer used may only work properly within a certain voltage range.\nComputer Control\nYour MacBook (or any laptop) can send control signals to dim or brighten the monitor but when it reaches it's lowest point, that's as far as it goes.  Your computer can't make it go any lower.\nFinding Your Monitor\nNow, to find a monitor that suits your needs, it's unfortunately going to be \"trial and error.\"  Go into a store and test them out.  If online, you'll likely have to test out buy and return a few (could get expensive because it's technically not faulty so return shipping would be on you).  Hardware Recommendations here on StackExchange may be helpful, but you'll need to be much more specific as to how dim you want this monitor to be because hardware manufacturers rarely (if ever) tell you how low their monitors can go - it's usually max brightness they promote.\n\nA: Consider a digital dimmer in addition to the built-in display dimmer, see for example https://github.com/sidneys/desktop-dimmer/releases. I am not sure though whether it can dim more than what the monitor is able to.\nYou can also solve the issue by buying a mac screen protector, there are lots of different types and any anti-glare / matte / filtering film should help out, though I cannot say which films will take away the most light.\nI am using a film on my laptop screen, I would not be able to work without it, I would have raised eyebrows from the constant mirroring. My screen protector film takes away some brightness so that I could even use it in complete darkness, that would not be possible without.\n", "Q: DELL WD15 DOCK with Macbook Pro 2018 - max resolution issue I am the owner of a DELL WD15 Dock and a Dell U3818DW monitor.\nI bought the dock to quickly switch between both of my macbooks.... But seems happen to not work as I'd like to.\n\n*\n\n*On my Macbook Pro 2017 13\", on Mojave 10.14.6, on the display options, if I press \"option + scaled\" to get the full list of available resolutions, I can get 3840 x 1600. On that one, the dock works like a charm.\n\n\n*On my Macbook Pro 2018 15\", on Catalina 10.15.5, the maximum resolution I can get is : 1920 x 1080. But it works if I use the HDMI apple adapter (but it is not handy to unplug the monitor from the dock every time).\nHas anyone ever faced that situation? Please tell me you found a solution! \nThank you anyway, and have a great day,\nPS : the monitor is connected with HDMI.\n\nA: The limitation is the Dell WD15 Dock only supports HDMI 1.4a (see specifications), which only supports 3840 x 1600 at 24p, and the dock does not support HDCP (content protection). Your Mac wants to run at 60p unless it is playing a movie, in which case Netflix wants HDCP. Count yourself lucky that your 2017 Mojave Mac will let you use 3840 x 1600 at all.\nThe fix is to use DisplayPort. Get yourself a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable (around $10) and use that to connect your dock to your display and you should be able to get the full 3840 x 1600 at 60 Hz support.\n\nA: Yeah indeed, I realized the issue with USB-C, so I ordered a caldigit TS3 plus, that should solve my issues.\nThanks for the help!\n", "Q: How can I update my (super old) Mac OS when the App Store shows no available updates? I am pretty computer-dumb. I am still operating on Mac OS X 10.10.5  MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012 with Yosemite) and have started to lose functionality - some websites don't open, softwares don't work, etc. due to my outdated browser. When I go to the app store to view available updates, there are none. Months ago I tried to manually update the OS to Catalina (I think) and it completely crashed my computer; I had a smart friend restore it, but it is back to the old OS.

And is there an easy way of doing it?\n\nA: Another option is to use the Anaconda distribution of Python3. This along with Anaconda will provide you with Python 3.8. Python should be run in virtual environments and these are simple to manage in Anaconda. Anaconda comes with several data analysis tools if you are interested in that.\n\nA: You can easily install any new version of python you wish; and you cannot remove the system python.\nmacOS traditionally comes with python2. You can install a newer version of python2, and choose whether you use the system python or the newer version by how you call it, or by the first line of your script. Using /usr/bin/python will use the system python, necessary for compatability; and using /usr/bin/env python will use the newer installed python.\nYou can install python3, and then call it using python3.\n", "Q: How to format a Time Machine SSD so it can also host the backup for external booting I want to split an external 1TB Nvme SSD into 500/500 partitions - so one partition can be a target for Time Machine backups, and the second partition can be used as a target to be an external partition that can host that backup\nSo basically, if something happens to my Macbook, I can potentially borrow a Macbook Air that only has, let's say 256GB of storage, instead of using that internal storage, I can use the second partition on my 1TB backup SSD to restore the backup on and boot externally\nSince there are so many arbitrary restrictions that you only learn about when you actually attempt things, I wanted to ask this question (As an example, maybe the backup partition has to be the second partition if macos can only be set up onto primary partitions etc. - or it might be impossible to restore a backup onto an external partition altogether)\n\nA: I ended up verifying this scenario myself, you can restore a Time Machine backup from an SSD partition, onto another APFS partition that's on the same SSD drive\nYou need to enable booting from external drives on T2 Macbook's, but it's a simple step that you are guided into (Everything available on MacOS Recovery with CMD+R) (You need the root password of the Macbook for Time Machine restore capability and changing the startup security, so if you are going to borrow an actively used device, you either need to get the password too, or do these steps with the owner after they enter the password themselves)\nIf you try this yourself, the only side effect is the startup disk getting changed to the external drive you just restored a backup onto, the restored OS is regularly usable, the disk benchmarks were 900mb/s read/write when booted from itself (everything kept on working as it was too, the only issue I saw was missing Chrome thumbnails, but Chrome password system was accessible as before)\nOverall I think this approach is very practical, obviously you need a secondary time machine since it's risky to use the same ssd that's housing your time machine in case of a secondary failure - It took 35 minutes to restore my ~200GB backup with a 10Gbps nvme enclosure onto itself\nSome edge information that's relevant at the moment: Avoid 40Gbps Chinese enclosures, major example is Orico (avoid them like your life depends on it, recently restored a system from an HDD, I had it connected with one of their USB-C/USB-A cables, it turns out the read speeds were 8mb/s because of this faulty cable, while it's 100mb/s if connected with a different cable), I believe they are all manufactured to fail, the enclosures heat SSD drives on idle and have various other issues. I found the Asus ROG Strix Arion 10Gbps drive to be very reliant (seemingly). SSD's don't heat as much (nowhere near 90C, more like 40C) and they are cool when idle. I've tested a Samsung 970 Evo Plus, it was unusable with the 40Gbps thrash enclosure, usable with 10Gbps one, but I wouldn't use it in this scenario, the heat is still concerning. Instead, a WD SN550 Dramless Nvme SSD was both cheaper, cooler and suprisingly faster on average. Since it doesn't throttle due to overheating.\n", "Q: When two devices connect via wifi, is the connection 'direct' or are they going through a wifi network? In the documentation for 'How to move your content to a new Mac', we see:\n\nIf both computers are using macOS Sierra or later, just make sure that they're near each other and have Wi-Fi turned on. If either is using OS X El Capitan or earlier, connect them to the same network using Wi-Fi or Ethernet.\n\nI presume it's implicit that if both computers are using macOS Sierra or later, they'll connect directly to each other (without requiring a separate wifi network)? Is this correct?\nThe reason I ask is because I currently have access to only slow wifi networks, which would pose a problem with the amount of data needing transfer.\n\nA: It doesn’t matter if you have a router or not, the macs will find each other and transfer. Plug a direct ethernet cable if you have it for fastest speeds, however. Your reading is correct - good work picking apart the nuance of direct connection on Sierra.\n", "Q: When I launch my macOS there running so many interfaces When my Mac started, I check my interfaces:\n$ ifconfig\nlo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384\n    options=1203<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TXSTATUS,SW_TIMESTAMP>\n    inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 \n    inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 \n    inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1 \n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\ngif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\nXHC20: flags=0<> mtu 0\nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=400<CHANNEL_IO>\n    ether a0:99:9b:17:50:07 \n    inet6 fe80::cd8:2bd4:f767:a6ed%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x5 \n    inet 192.168.2.228 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255\n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nen1: flags=8963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=460<TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO>\n    ether 82:13:08:b0:ec:c0 \n    media: autoselect <full-duplex>\n    status: inactive\nen2: flags=8963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=460<TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO>\n    ether 82:13:08:b0:ec:c1 \n    media: autoselect <full-duplex>\n    status: inactive\nbridge0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=63<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6>\n    ether 82:13:08:b0:ec:c0 \n    Configuration:\n        id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0\n        maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200\n        root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0\n        ipfilter disabled flags 0x2\n    member: en1 flags=3<LEARNING,DISCOVER>\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0\n    member: en2 flags=3<LEARNING,DISCOVER>\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 7 priority 0 path cost 0\n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: <unknown type>\n    status: inactive\np2p0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 2304\n    options=400<CHANNEL_IO>\n    ether 02:99:9b:17:50:07 \n    media: autoselect\n    status: inactive\nawdl0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1484\n    options=400<CHANNEL_IO>\n    ether ba:2f:ce:01:6e:14 \n    inet6 fe80::b82f:ceff:fe01:6e14%awdl0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xa \n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nllw0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=400<CHANNEL_IO>\n    ether ba:2f:ce:01:6e:14 \n    inet6 fe80::b82f:ceff:fe01:6e14%llw0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xb \n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nutun0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1380\n    inet6 fe80::5e2a:55ee:b7dc:1b30%utun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xc \n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\nutun1: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 2000\n    inet6 fe80::62d2:7e57:5727:90c8%utun1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xd \n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n\nin the beginning, I only use lo0, en0, maybe en1 and en2. I some times install the VMware Fusion and docker and other things. I don't know why there get some many interfaces out, when I launched my Mac there will start so many interfaces, this is a waste of the computing resources, how to delete them or stop them?\n\nA: You do not want to get rid of your active interfaces, obviously, because they are active, meaning you are using them.\nInactive interfaces use up so little resources that it is not worth deleting them, especially since they will just have to be created again when you need them. They use a tiny bit of memory and that is it; they have no impact on performance.\nDocker and VMware both create a lot of interfaces so they can use a separate, private, local network for their virtual machines, but they can get created by other software, too.\n", "Q: How can I force a folder and the contents to be downloaded locally and not uploaded to the iCloud? I am trying to store a folder locally on my Macbook pro. I am running Catalina 10.14.4. Once I download the videos, they eventually all upload to the cloud and I have to redownload them. I am about to leave on a roadtrip and won't have internet access to redownload the file.\nI have tried including a folder in the same location as the videos with .nosync in the name, but the files still upload.\nPlease let me know if you have any recommendations.\nThank you for your time,\nCameron\n\n\nA: \nI have tried including a folder in the same location as the videos with .nosync in the name, but the files still upload.\n\nBut have you tried changing the name of the folder that contains the files to end with .nosync? iCloud Drive ignores the contents of folders named with .nosync, not the files that are in the same directory as such a folder. So, in your example, you'd change the name of the folder Lecture Videos to Lecture Videos.nosync.\nAlso—perhaps a simpler solution—you could simply move your Lecture Videos folder somewhere on your disk that isn't a subdirectory of ~/Documents or ~/Desktop, which are the two folders automatically synced to iCloud. For instance, you could put your Lecture Videos folder in ~/Pictures or ~/Downloads.\nAnd, lastly, before you leave for your trip, you could go to System Preferences > Apple ID > iCloud and disable Optimize Mac Storage, which—if your laptop has enough free space—will (usually) prevent files from being automatically removed from your local disk once they're uploaded.\n", "Q: Can I charge my MacBook Pro from an older iMac? After dropping my 2012 MacBook Pro, the build-in magnetic MagSafe charging system doesn’t seem to be working any more. Is there a way to charge it from an old (2002) iMac, to recover my files? Or any other way?\n\nA: There's no other way of charging a 2012 MacBook Pro than through the MagSafe power port. If that has stopped functioning, you cannot charge the laptop as usual.\nYour options are primarily:\n\n*\n\n*getting the MagSafe power port repaired\n\n*taking out the battery and charging it externally and put it back\n\n*take out the hard drive or SSD (depending on model) and transfer data externally\n\nTo recover the files I would prefer the last option, taking out the drive. It is an ordinary SATA interface, so you should be able to buy a cheap USB-to-SATA interface at most computer stores, that would enable you to transfer the data to another computer.\n", "Q: locate `pre-commit` and not `pre-commit.sample` I would like to find all files named pre-commit, the problem is that I also find pre-commit.sample.\nlocate pre-commit.\nHow can I find the files that don't have the .sample extension?\n\nA: locate uses shell-style globbing so the options for the pattern are kind of limited.\nThe simple way probably is to just run\nlocate pre-commit | grep -v 'sample$'\n\nOr you could make use of the special case documented in man locate\nAs a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'') is matched as\nthough it were ``*foo*''.\n\nand use locate 'pre?commit' (quoting is required to prevent the shell from expanding the pattern) to prevent the automatic adding of the * wildcard.\n", "Q: How to add an .icc colour profile to OSX 10.15 In OSX 10.13 i can add an .ICC profile to the OS by copying and pasting a .ICC to libary/colourSync/profiles\nBut in OSX 10.15 the above folder structure does not exist. Any idea how i can add a colour profile to the OS in 10.15 ?\n\nA: The folder /Library/ColorSync/Profiles does, or should exist on macOS 10.15.\n(Note the / at the beginning, signifying the root level of the volume, the US spelling of 'color', and the correct capitalization.)\nIt's possible, or even likely, that the similar path inside the User account may not be there. E.g. /Users/<yourUserName>/Library/ColorSync/Profiles\nYou can create either of these folders, if absent, and the OS will use any profiles contained inside.\nYou can check the location of installed profiles with ColorSync Utility. In the Profiles tab, select a Profile in the Sidebar, and the location will be given as part of the information provided.\n\nIf the root level Library is really missing the ColorSync folder, then I would suggest reinstalling the OS, as you don't know what else is missing.

Few modifications of normal using have been done between the timestamps of the 2 commands updatedb.\n\nSo I conclude there is a really a difference betweeen GNU/MacOS and GNU/Linux implementation.\nAny explanation is welcome.\n\nA: The problem here is that you are running GNU's updatedb with the macOS's find. gupdatedb is a shell script that expects to be running a GNU-compatible find. In particular, it converts --prunepaths to a GNU-compatible basic regular expression.\n--prunepaths='/private/tmp /private/var/folders /private/var/tmp */Backups.backupdb /Volumes /System'\n\nconverts to\nPRUNEREGEX=\"\\(^/private/tmp$\\)\\|\\(^/private/var/folders$\\)\\|\\(^/private/var/tmp$\\)\\|\\(^*/Backups.backupdb$\\)\\|\\(^/System$\\)\\|\\(^/Volumes$\\)\"\n\nGNU BRE (basic regular expressions) treat \\| as an \"alternative\" operator:\n\n‘foo\\|bar’ matches either ‘foo’ or ‘bar’\n\nThis is a GNU extension to the BRE syntax, and the macOS find operator does not accept it. So the whole prune string fails to match anything.\nThe macOS (and POSIX) BRE does not have an alternative operator, so it is not a super easy fix. The macOS updatedb script converts the alternative into explicit -or operators in the find command. You can modify the GNU script to do that. Or get gfind to work.\nBy the way, GNU's updatedb script builds a completely new database from scratch on every run, just like macOS's.\nYour Debian installation is using mlocate which is a completely different implementation than GNU locate, not as widely ported, and not available on macOS AFAIK. And even though mlocate runs quickly on your Debian installation, that does not mean it runs a lot faster than GNU locate. Both run in under a second building the entire database from scratch on my Debian installation when all the disk metadata is in RAM (which is usually the case).\nApple provides mdfind, which uses the incremental database created by mds, which is largely triggered by file system events. This makes it (theoretically) much more efficient than even mlocate, which still has to traverse the entire directory structure looking for changed directories. The problem is that incremental builds accumulate errors. That is why locate, with its full rebuild every time, is still around and preferred by many.\n\nA: The Apple version is run via /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb which is a shell script. Some additional paths are excluded from the search there. In Mojave these are\n: ${PRUNEPATHS:=\"/private/tmp /private/var/folders /private/var/tmp */Backups.backupdb\"} # unwanted directories\n\nPS: I don't have Catalina so you may need to check whether other paths need to be excluded as well.\n", "Q: Disable all Mac system keyboard shortcuts whilst using nano I want to use nano on the terminal, however the built-in system keyboard shortcuts constantly conflict with the usability of the program.\nIs there a way in which I can set a system option to disable all system shortcuts whilst I am running nano?

The Nano website has a keybinding section of documentation here. You may need to configure a .nanorc and redefine those keybindings that conflict with macOS.\nhttps://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html#Rebinding-Keys\nThe macOS Terminal under the Profile -> Keyboard has a checkbox for Use Option as Meta key.  Seems to work for the nano meta keys.

The OS is very slow and has some read errors when I tried to use CCC to clone it. Anyways, I managed to copy some necessary files to another external drive and am trying to replace this fusion drive with one 2TB SSD and do a clean install. Do I need to split the fusion drive before I take them out of Macmini if I want to use them as two separate external drives later or I could just remove them without the split and format them later as two external drives? Thanks.\n\nA: You can remove them without any fuss or erase. Fusion is a software layer, not something that changes on the hardware side.\nYou can remove and erase / format them in any order you like. If you haven’t formatted then yet, maybe try that unless you’re sure you want an SSD even if they work, but I’m guessing you know they still work since you plan on reusing them.\n\nA: I had a 2012 Mini with a Fusion drive, and I swapped out the SSD for much larger SSD. (I didn't have the courage to remove the mechanical drive, which requires 'extra steps'.\nAs soon as you remove one of the drives , then that breaks the Fusion scheme.\nWhen I rebooted, the mechanical drive was reported as an 'Unknown Format', and needed to be partitioned.

On Friday I closed the lid, disconnected from power and put it away. Today, I tried turning it on but I got the low battery screen.\nLittle surprising but I've had it happen before that it would go in sleep mode (instead of hibernation like it's supposed to) when I close the lid and then empty the battery in my bag, so I thought nothing of it and plugged it in.\nThe screen changed from the \"low battery, plug in\" icon to \"low battery, charging\" icon. Usually this would let me boot within a couple of minutes, but this time it's now been hours on charge and still won't turn on.\nI have tried ^ Control⌥ Option⇧ Shift⦿ Power to reset the SMC, no effect. The LED on my original Apple adapter stopped working a week ago or so, but it was charging fine so don't think that's related.\nWhy would the MacBook recognize that it's plugged in and charging, but still refuse to turn on because of low battery? Is there any way to fix this without taking it for servicing (almost impossible in the middle of lock down)?\n\nA: The LED confirms that the charging is actually taking place.  If the LED stays off, then most likely reason is (keep in mind, LED life is 15000+ hrs.) that the adapter cannot provide the amount of wattage that the computer is requesting.  This results in the adapter having voltage too low for the MacBook to be able to actually charge.\nIn other words, even though it is displaying that it is charging -- it is not, and the battery is actually getting discharged just from having to display this screen.

Since you don’t specify anything about which version of the OS / which version of the program, hopefully this general guidance helps you research what step to take next.\nHere is my advice - if you’re not sure how to figure out a security error or just don’t want to be bothered, it’s best to not relax security / GateKeeper. It is a significant bit of responsibility to add and you lose that protection for all software - not just for this, so be sure to re-protect with GateKeeper as soon as you run software that can’t be bothered to protect you from malware.\nAlso - you could have legitimate malware and be one step away from unleashing it. Be sure you have a backup before relaxing Apple security in case you have a tampered product you downloaded. Just because it came from the proper web site, doesn’t mean that web site or your network wasn’t compromised.\n", "Q: Why are my iPhone 7 charge & transfer contact & cable less and less reliable (keywords: loose / defective contact, slack joint)? Why are my iPhone 7 charge & transfer contact & cable less and less reliable (synonyms: loose / defective contact, slack joint)? Of course, the question stands for any iPhone version with the same contact type.\nContext.\nI seem to lose more and more reliability of the cable contact or the cable during charging or file transfers. Often the connection stops almost immediately, I have to adjust the cable with some pressure. I know now that it is not about the cables, since I have bought a new one that led to the same result. Today it started to lose contact after a while, without any clear reason.\n\nA: It is just dust in the contact.\nThere was just dust inside the contact of the iPhone coming from carrying it around. The flat charging cable added to the problem, as it can only press the dust further inside. That is why I think it is a specific iPhone-7-upwards problem which you do not necessarily have with other contact shapes. I noticed at some point that I could not put in the cable completely. Then I got the most of the dust out with a plastic-bristled brush. You could not get rid of the dust just blowing at it. With a very thin kitchen knife I could get a ball of dust out in the end, solving this.\nI am sharing this though it might be totally obvious. It took me a month to find out, that is why it might still help someone else.\n", "Q: Restrict super user write access to some files Is there a way to add folders to the SIP (System Integrity Protection) configurations in order to prevent them to be modified by the root user?\nOr any other way not involving System Integrity Protection? \nI want to protect the host file so I can block distracting websites and not being able to modify it as a root user. As a developer, I still need to be a root user so deleting sudo is not an option. \nI'm looking for a solution which is independent from my internet connection.\n\nA: SelfControl\nSelfControl is an open source project aimed at restricting distractions:\n\nSelfControl is a free and open-source application for macOS that lets you block your own access to distracting websites, your mail servers, or anything else on the Internet. Just set a period of time to block for, add sites to your blacklist, and click \"Start.\" Until that timer expires, you will be unable to access those sites—even if you restart your computer or delete the application.\n\nPi-Hole\nTo block distracting websites and services on all your devices, consider blocking them on your network using Pi-Hole.\nWith this approach you avoid needing to modify your macOS configuration.\n", "Q: Selecting a dropdown menu in Safari I need to create an Applescript to open a certain website and export it as PDF using the menu \"Save as PDF…\" under the File menu.

The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: AppleScript doesn't know about menu items, so you will need to use an application that does, such as System Events.  Menus can get confusing since menu items can also have menus (take a look at the scripting dictionary), but your command would look something like:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n   open location \"http://www.website.com/\" -- this command is from Standard Additions\n   activate -- bring Safari to the front if it isn't already\nend tell\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\" to click menu item \"Export as PDF…\" of menu \"File\" of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1 of application process \"Safari\"\n\n", "Q: Creating a pre-recorded lecture on macOS I have created a PowerPoint presentation and I want to create a video of me presenting it. I'm looking for a software to make my life easier. The features I'm looking for are:\n\n*\n\n*Can record a 25-minute video for free.\n\n*Works on Mac.\n\n*Can record the screen and me (audio+video).\n\n*Lets me rewind while recording and continue from there, so that if I make a tiny mistake I can just go a few seconds (or one slide) back and continue recording.\n\nThis is not a regular opinion-base recommendation question, because I haven't found even one software that answers these needs. PowerPoint for Mac doesn't record video (only audio) and the built-in screenshot program doesn't record it either. I can use zoom and share my screen and record, but feature number 4 isn't supported.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The fourth point about rewinding video and re-recording is unheard of. Let's say you made a minor mistake while speaking, best you can do is one or more of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open the video editor, add a text box that shows the correct thing to say, make it visible in the video as an overlapping window for 3-4 seconds. This is a common method to fix mistakes in post-shoot editing.\n\n\n*When you realise that you've made a mistake, immediately repeat the last sentence with the correct word and let the recording go on. While editing it later on, trim the portion where you misspoke and delete that part. There will be an slightly abrupt cut but not a big deal in lectures.\nAll this is possible in iMovie for macOS. It's free and easy to use. Also use help centre: https://help.apple.com/imovie/mac/10.1/#/mov5ec96da08\nFor screen recording, Quicktime is a good option. If you want to appear speaking in the video, use Photo Booth and put it in a corner such that it appears on the screen.\nOther way is to use a camera and use clips from both the camera and the screen in the final video.\n\nA: For freeware with no time limit, OBS Studio is recommended by many. However, since it's too complicated to learn, I'm now using RecMaster for easier presentation video creation.\n", "Q: Secure empty trash on external drive OSX I’ve got an internal SSD on a 2018 MBP, with these drives macOS no longer gives you the option to secure erase the trash.\nI’ve connected an older HDD external drive which I wish to secure erase the trash on, how can i do this in OSX 10.13 ?\n\nA: To securely “empty” the trash on an external drive you can use the rm command with the -P option which will overwrite it 3 times - similar to a DoD 3-pass overwrite.\n% rm -P /Volumes/foo/bar/.Trash/*\n\nThe other option is to reinstall srm via Homebrew or Macports and use srm in place of rm\n% srm  /Volumes/foo/bar/.Trash/*\n\nYou could even create an alias and put it in your .zprofile or .bash_profile depending on the shell you’re using.\nalias emptytrash=‘rm -P /Volumes/foo/bar/.Trash/*’\n\n\nA: Secure erase relies on writes replacing the data in the blocks allocated for a file. With SSDs this is technically not possible. If you want to protect data on an external drive, you need to encrypt it (can be done with a right-click on the drive in Finder).\nPS: encrypting external drives is advisable in general, otherwise anybody with physical access to the drive can access its content.\n", "Q: How do I delete songs on my iphone using Windows version of iTunes? I have an iPhone 8+ and use the Windows version of iTunes. There are all these songs my son purchased thru iTunes showing up on my iPhone. How do I get these listings off my iPhone?\nNote: The songs are not physically on the iPhone, but listed as downloadable. I don't want them listed at all.\n\nA: There are two ways to see only your downloaded songs, at least on iOS 13 and newer:\nMethod 1\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Settings app.\n\n*Scroll down to the \"Music\" section and click on it.\n\n*Deselect the \"Show all purchases\" option.\n\nThis should now only show your local downloads.\nMethod 2\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Music app on your iPhone and click on the \"Library\" icon in the bottom menu bar.\n\n*In the top right corner, click on \"Edit\".\n\n*A customizable list with checkmark circles should appear. One of the categories that you can select is \"Downloaded\", which – as the name suggests – shows only the songs that are stored locally on your phone. You'll also see another category called \"Songs\". This category shows all of your songs (both in the cloud and the ones stored locally on your phone).\n\n*Uncheck the \"Songs\" category and check the \"Downloaded\" category.\n\n*Click \"OK\" in the top right corner of the screen to close the list. You should now see only your downloaded songs whenever you click on the \"Downloaded\" category.\n\nAnd if you want to see all your purchases once more (including those that haven't been downloaded), you can simply select the \"Songs\" category instead of the \"Downloaded\" category – that is if you haven't disabled the \"Show all purchases\" option in Settings.\n\nA: Get your son and yourself separate Apple IDs.

Here is the setup:\n\n*\n\n*13\" MacBook Pro 2020 (2 x USB-C ports)\n\n\n*2 x Dell U2518D monitors (not Thunderbolt-equipped)\nI tried connecting everything together with a Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Express Dock, but it does not seem to work, unfortunately. I connected one monitor via HDMI-HDMI cable to the dock, and the other monitor via Thunderbolt-DP cable (that came with the monitor), and then connected the dock via USB 2.0 to USB-C to the laptop.\nI think the problem might be the link between the dock and the laptop, but I have no idea how I could connect it otherwise. Any ideas?\n\nA: Your issue is very much like the one in this question about a MacBook with only two USB-C ports as well:  MacBook 4K/60Hz adapter is working directly, but not via USB-C hub\nWhile you have two Thunderbolt ports, the MacBook only had USB ports that supported DisplayPort.  So, in your case, you have a couple of options:\n\n*\n\n*Plug one display into one of the USB-C ports and use the USB-C Hub w/ Power Delivery as described in the answer in the above linked question to connect your devices and your charger.\n\n\n*Use a proper Thunderbolt 3 Dock.  The problem that you're having with the Belkin Thunderbolt 2 dock is that while Thunderbolt is technically backward compatible, Thunderbolt 3 uses passive cables where as Thunderbolt 2 cables were active.  A number of \"high bandwidth\" devices like storage and display require an active cable which the standard USB-C cables are not.\nI recently wrote an answer about this for the question LG UltraFine & replacement Belkin USB-C cable gives blurry text.  Basically all (quality) USB-C cables are Thunderbolt 3 cables.  However, not all are active.  Active Thunderbolt 3 cables carry power and cost about $50USD more than regular ones.  I believe this is why your Belkin dock isn't working properly.\nI would go with the first option: using the USB-C hub with PD.  This gives you a lot of options out of the gate without spending too much money.  If/when your needs outgrow the hub, go for the Thunderbolt 3 dock as you'll have much more room for growth.\nYou can try getting the active TB3 cable, but to me, it's more of a bodge and I'm not convinced the Apple TB3 to TB2 adapter carries power.  There are lots of folks looking for Thunderbolt 2 docks because they have 2017 and older MacBook Pro laptops they'd like to expand but can't because of product availability; it could fetch a nice price online and help pay for that Thunderbolt 3 dock.\n\nA: The problem is with the USB-C -> USB-A connection you are losing your DP/HDMI video in the transition between adapters.\nIdeally, you need a dock that provides a USB-C connector and runs USB 3.1 and/or Thunderbolt3 over it. USB-C is the connector it could be USB 3.1 or it could be Thunderbolt3. The Mac can send video over just USB 3.1 via USB-C without Thunderbolt. Buying a newer USB-C dock which can be expensive. You need to ensure the USB-C dock can provide enough power (wattage) to charge your MacBook Pro battery. Look at the side of your charger for the wattage your Mac uses. 63W/90W, etc. Thunderbolt3 is not required unless you need to plug fast Thunderbolt3 drives into the dock.\nHowever, if you don't mind attaching two USB-C cables one for each monitor and a third for MacBook Pro power, then they are cheap and easily obtained online. Since both monitors are the same they should both have DisplayPort and HDMI ports.  I would prefer DisplayPort over HDMI every time when driving computer monitors.\nSearch your online retailers for the following:\n\n*\n\n*USB-C to DisplayPort Cable\n\n*USB-C to HDMI Cable\n\n", "Q: Terminal Disk Free `df` returns Huge `ifree` free inodes This has been going on for a few years through several upgrades. In the Terminal when I type df -h the ifree numbers are ridiculously high and clearly off.\nExample:\n$ df /\nFilesystem   512-blocks      Used Available Capacity iused               ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1  489825072 442781368  39401000    92% 2253035 9223372036852522772    0%   /\n\nThe disks /private/var/vm and Android File Transfer Agent.app also have huge numbers for ifree.\nSystem Information:\nAbout This Mac: \nmacOS Mojave\nVersion 10.14.6\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n$ uname -a\nDarwin xxxxxxx.xxxx.xx.comcast.net 18.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.7.0: Thu Jun 18 20:50:10 PDT 2020; root:xnu-4903.278.43~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\n\n\nA: My best guess is that these are filesystems that do not have inodes (the vast majority of modern filesystems don't, actually pretty much only old Unix filesystems do), and so the filesystem driver just synthesizes an arbitrary number because the 50 year old API says the driver must provide a number of free inodes even though modern filesystems haven't had them in a decade.\nIn particular, I am assuming that your / filesystem is APFS, which is indeed neither a traditional Unix filesystem (it was designed specifically for macOS) nor an old filesystem (it was announced in 2016). APFS is fully 64 bit, and as far as I know, it doesn't use a traditional inode-based scheme. Actually, the entire design of APFS and the way it intersects multiple layers of the traditional Unix filesystem, VFS, and block device stack, is very much non-traditional, and much more reminiscent of ZFS and the Be filesystem (which is no surprise since the designer of BeFS works at Apple now).\nNote that the number you showed is very close to the maximum 64 bit signed integer (9223372036854775807), or in other words, it is close to the maximum of size_t in a 64 bit version of Darwin. In fact, the sum of used and free inodes is exactly 9223372036854775807. So, what is happening here, is that the filesystem driver simply synthesizes 263-1 (size_tmax) inodes for use.\nPresumably, when you say that \"it has been going on for a few years\", you are talking about the move from 32 bit to 64 bit Darwin, and before that, the numbers were closer to 2147483647, which is of course the maximum for size_t in 32 bit Darwin.\nFor fun, you might download the open source Darwin source code from Apple and compile a 32 bit version of df, and I bet you, the numbers you will see are 2253035 and 2145230612 (2147483647 - 2253035).\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook use more energy when idle when plugged in? Using iStat Menus, I tested the power usage of my MacBook Pro when idle and plugged in. When it was off the charger, it used around 5-6 W of power consistently. When I plugged it in, however, it used 6-7 W of power consistently. I repeated this multiple times over multiple days, and in general it uses more power for any task (or even when idling) when it is plugged in.\nWhy does the Mac use slightly more power when plugged in, when seemingly doing the same thing both times? Does the Mac underclock itself when it's running on battery power? Would underclocking still have an effect on power consumption is the laptop is idle?\nNote: I had \"dim display on battery\" disabled, so it shouldn't be due to a change in monitor brightness.\n\nA: When you disregard things such as dimming the display on battery and CPU-throttling - you're left with a quite obvious difference: charging the battery.\nEven at 100% charge, you'll spend some extra energy keeping the battery charged while using the computer.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro: One USB-C port only works for charging devices Is this possible:\nI have two USB-C ports on my MacBook Pro 2019. One port works perfectly well. The other is odd to say the least.\nAfter some testing, it seems as if the port \"can't handle strenuous tasks\" and by strenuous tasks, I mean running a USB-C hub with external hard drives plugged in it or using the port to go to an external monitor.\nIt does work when charging my iPhone or using the port to charge the MacBook itself.\nSo my assumption overall is that it does work, but only small, less strenuous tasks, if that's even possbile?\nCan any USB-C knowledgeable people confirm this is possible? Could it be a software issue?\nI've tried resetting stuff like the SMC etc. just haven't reinstalled macOS yet, which is the last thing I'd wanna do, it's on the latest version of Catalina at the moment.\n\nA: You have a hardware issue.\nAnd, unfortunately, it's a logic board problem.\n\n*\n\n*The power rail not may not be delivering enough current to the USB bus\n\n*The USB controller for that side may be malfunctioning\n\n*The circuitry that connects the controller to the port may be problematic.\n\nUnfortunately, without putting hands on with proper diagnostic gear it's impossible to know.  In fact, if you take it to Apple, they will simply change out the logic board rather than identify and fix the problem.\nThe one thing you should do is an reset the SMC.  There are different methods depending on your Mac model so be sure to read the steps carefully.\nThis is one of the actual few problems where an SMC reset is applicable - you're having power issues.  Re-installing macOS is the last thing you should do - booting into Safe Mode or Recovery will get you a clean version of macOS without the hassle of overwriting your system and risking your data.  You can also run Apple Diagnostics to see if there are any error codes.\nPotential Workaround\nIf you can still transfer data, just not handle the \"strenuous\" tasks as you described, you may still be able to work with it if you use a powered USB hub.  It will supply the power to the USB bus that your logic board can't\n", "Q: Why do I see this installation screen upon logging in? I logged into my Mac and the progress bar went about half way when the screen blacked out, another loading progress bar showed up, after which this showed up (see image).\nWhat's going on?\n\n\nA: That looks like macOS Catalina 10.5.6 Update released 7/15/2020.  Seems Catalina finally decided to force it on you. You must have Automatic Updates turned on which isn't necessarily a bad thing except for when it happens when you have things to do. A large update can take 45-60min.\nIn System Preferences -> Software Updates there's a checkbox to Automatically keep my Mac up to date as well as an Advanced button. In Advanced there is Check for updates, Download new updates when available, Install macOS updates, Install app updates from the App Store and Install system data files and security updates.\nYou can make adjustments to these settings to stop the Mac from automatically installing macOS updates. Those are the big dot releases like \".6\" in this case. But you really should install these updates because they always include security fixes to protect you.\nOut of band security updates usually take the form of \"Security Update 2020-004\" which was for Mojave and High Sierra while the dot-6 update included those fixes in 10.15.6.\n", "Q: Can a self-signed certificate use an IP address for an entry in Subject Alternative Name? From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176\n\nTLS server certificates must present the DNS name of the server in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the certificate. DNS names in the CommonName of a certificate are no longer trusted.\n\nAccording to these new requirements, should I be able to use an IP address in the SAN field?  I read an answer that stated or implied that it was possible, but I cannot make it work.  Obviously I realise that an IP isn't a DNS name, but... well I can hope.\nI can workaround the limitation by setting up an mDNS (eg Bonjour) and use host.local style names (which does work) but this is not ideal for my situation.\n\nA: Yes, according to the standard (RFC 5280 page 37) you can use an IP address in the SAN (SubjectAltName) field!\nThe standard defines a number of possibilities for specifying the SAN, including iPAddress, dNSName, and various others.\nThe most obvious option is to use iPAddress, where the IP address is stored as an octet string. You can also write the IP address in the dNSName field, which is a common string (IA5String to be precise).\nIn practice, you want to do both at the same time as software support varies. For example it seems that especially Microsoft software (like the Internet Explorer and Edge browsers) look at the dNSName and interprets IP addresses there, whereas browsers like Safari and Chrome look at the iPAddress field.\n", "Q: I can’t start my computer after installing update I have an 2010 iMac running High Sierra. Recently I got a notice that there was an update to my system. I’ve installed a few and they worked fine. I installed this latest one tonight but my iMac will not restart using this new upgrade. When I try to start my computer it loads a small part of the system and then just sits there with no advancing of the slider. I have tried starting in safe mode but no luck. I tried restarting in recovery mode but my recovery disk is apparently not working.\nIs there any way to start my computer?

I thought I had a backup disk but that method doesn’t seem to work.  I am completely out of ideas and my computer is a brick.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Start from Recovery & re-install the OS.\nThis will lay a fresh OS over the old one without affecting anything else on the Mac.\nI've had this happen several times on different Macs with High Sierra security updates.\n\nA: Well my attempt at installing the System update worked after all. I started it installing and went to bed. When I got up this morning the update had installed and seems to not cause any problems - yet! I think maybe I was too impatient. But when I tried it I waited for over 30 minutes and the slider had not moved. I don't know how long it took but at least I got it installed. So lesson learned is if your update looks like it won't install, let it run all night and see if that works.\n", "Q: Passcode entanglement with UID While reading the Apple Platform Security document, I came across this statement under the Passcodes and Passwords section\nThe passcode is entangled with the device’s UID, so brute-force attempts must be\nperformed on the device under attack. \n\nI have a few questions\n\n*\n\n*What is meant by the passcode being entangled with the UID and why the brute force attempts have to be performed on the device itself?\n\n\n*What sort of cryptographic algorithms are used for this?\nAny online links to this topic is appreciated.\n\nA: In general \"entangling\" means that you're somehow \"mixing\" two components into one. This can be done in a number of ways.\nIn this specific instance what happens is that the UID and passcode are entangled by using an AES encryption algorithm. The UID is as the key for the AES encryption, and the passcode is used as the clear text. The cipher text is then the entangled data.\nIn order to create the entangled data, you'll need both the UID and the passcode.\nThe reason why this must happen on device is that the UID is a unique number that is \"fused\" into the CPU (i.e. each CPU has a different number, and it cannot be changed after the fact) - and that number is not accessible by software directly. However software can ask the CPU to encrypt data with the AES algorithm using the UID as the key - the software can then get the cipher text without ever knowing the UID.\nAs an added complexity, Apple actually uses a key derivation function known as PBKDF2 where additional computation is needed to go from the starting data to the actual data used as an encryption key. Apple is using 80 rounds (basically \"loops\" of a computation processes). The purpose of this is to make it slow (i.e. use a lot of CPU time) to come from a pass code (which we're trying to brute force) to the encryption key - even when you have access to the CPU with the UID inside it. Making it slow means that brute forcing takes a lot longer than otherwise, hopefully making it infeasible.\n", "Q: Can MacOS Dictionary be invoked by a URI? I've seen links in web pages on MacOS and IOS that invoke other apps, notably App Store and iBooks.  If I recall correctly, they usually have a protocol¹ that in some way identifies the app.\nI am using an HTML/PHP/MySQL app called Learning With Texts that allows it to create a URI to a web page with place holders to auto-insert a word to look up in an online dictionary.  Now I know that ⌘⌃D can be used on MacOS to display all instances of a string that appear in any MacOS dictionary.  I am wondering whether there is a URI syntax that will look it up in a specific dictionary.  (And what is that syntax.)\nIn Catalina, if that matters.\n¹the first part of the URI—in a web link, the protocol is “http” or “https”\n\nA: \nCan MacOS Dictionary be invoked by a URI?\n\nYes: dict://\nExample HTML code: <a href=\"dict://foobar\">Lookup 'foobar' in Dictionary</a>\nTested with Safari under macOS Catalina using:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n    <title>Dictionary Lookup</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p><a href=\"dict://foobar\">Lookup 'foobar' in Dictionary</a></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nWhen clicking the hyperlink, one is presented with:\n\n\n\nI am wondering whether there is a URI syntax that will look it up in a specific dictionary.

I wonder how could we get the rankings for apps from app store, for example on AppAnnie, there is a dashboard showing top apps in different categories.\nIs there any apis to achieve this? Or we need to pay Apple to access such data?\n\nA: App Annie doesn't get all its data from the App Store.  According to recent stories about their funding rounds, they have hundreds of different sources of data, including:\n\n*\n\n*App Store reviews\n\n*social media posts\n\n*site scraping\n\n*VPN applications\n\n*marketers\n\n*app developers and publishers\n\n*mobile advertisers and traffic managers\n\nApp Annie doesn't publicly disclose how it gets all its data.  This story states:\n\nApp Annie collects the data largely by distributing high-quality free apps, such as VPN software; it’s one of the most-downloaded such apps in the U.S. Each is free but asks for the right to collect data on apps, usage, and other behavior. Combine enough of these and you eventually get massive reach.\n\nDevelopers allow the company to access their Google and Apple App Store analytic accounts in return for limited access to their data.  This allows them, and similar companies, to know and compare download and usage stats.\n", "Q: How does my brand new iPhone have steps activity recorded on it (in the Health app) from a month ago? I just received a brand new iPhone from Apple.com. It booted up to a fresh \"welcome\" state, as expected. I did not do any kind of data transfer/import; I set it up as new. And I configured it with a brand new Apple ID / iCloud account not linked anywhere else.\nAnd yet... it has 197 steps on it from a day in June, registered in 3 chunks at 3 different times that day (around 3AM, 5AM and 12PM California time -- it was shipped from California). Tapping on these steps shows additional metadata that verifies that the steps were indeed registered on this device, not synced from anywhere.\nIt also has one flight of stairs climbed from the same day in June.\nHow is this possible? Does the device register steps before it's been set up, and it was turned on multiple times in a day (including in the middle of the night) during some test/QA phase? Surely all new iPhone buyers are not receiving devices with ghost steps on them?\nI considered that perhaps it had registered some steps I made while setting it up and before the correct date/time had a chance to sync. But that wouldn't explain the preexisting steps coming in 3 chunks at 3 different times of day that are many hours apart.\nCould this indicate that perhaps the device is not as \"new\" as promised?\n\nA: This sound like a case of a product return - a customer who purchased it and returned it.\nNow, you state that you purchased it as “Brand New” so Apple, of all entities, shouldn’t be repackaging returned items and selling them as new.   Actually, they can.\nSpecifically, from that post, there’s an FTC opinion giving guidance on usage of the term “New Product.”   Basically, they can take a previously opened product that may have even been turned on but  generally unused and in new condition, repackage it as new so long as there is a conspicuous process behind how they do this.\nIt’s entirely possible someone bought this iPhone, tried it out (maybe for this specific feature) didn’t like it and returned it. Apple did a simple factory reset not realizing there was data stored, and repackaged it as new.  Obviously, one got though the process that shouldn’t.   Is it a major problem and fraud on Apple’s part?  No. The process must be conspicuous, not perfect.\nSimply contact Apple, tell them that it appears the product is used when it should be be new and you want a replacement.  They’ll accommodates you.\n\nA: I would erase all content and settings and the check without signing in to any account.\nThis is almost certainly not a case where it’s “not new” and most likely a date / time error in your iCloud bucket of data or the device.\nIt’s hard for us to guess, though without seeing the pictures / data / and work on the device to look at the entire setup. This data only comes from encrypted backups or synced watches in my experience. Not even iCloud would put that data on the device other than as when a restore of a device backup happens.\n", "Q: Upgrading to macOS Catalina with Android Studio I have a MacBook Pro mid-2014, running macOS Mojave 10.14.6.\nI have built an iOS app using Xcode 10.1, but when I wanted to upload it to the App Store, I came upon the following message:\n\nERROR ITMS-90725: \"SDK Version Issue. This app was built with the iOS 12.1 SDK. As of June 30, 2020, all apps for iPhone or iPad must be built with the iOS 13 SDK or later, included with Xcode 11 or later.\"\n\nI entered to the App Store, but I couldn't update to Xcode's latest version, as I don't have macOS Catalina installed. The problem is that I need Android Studio on my computer, but according to Android Studio's website, it is supported up to macOS Mojave, not Catalina.\nMy question is, is it safe to upgrade to macOS Catalina and keep using Android Studio? Or is there another way to solve this? Maybe installing a different version of Xcode that will run on macOS Mojave and supports iOS 13?\n\nA: I have installed Xcode 11.3 from Apple Developers website.\n\nThis version supports iOS 13 SDK and macOS 10.14.4, which is exactly what I needed.\n\nA: Assuming you have sufficient space on your disk, you could try partitioning it into two separate volumes from Disk Utility, then installing macOS Catalina onto the second partition.  While requiring more disk space, this has the highest performance and the easiest means to copy files between the two different OSes and developer environments.\nYou could also create a macOS Catalina virtual machine in most of the popular emulators, such as VMWare Fusion, Virtualbox or Parallels.  (Apple's EULA for the macOS specifically allows running it under emulation on Apple hardware.)  By sacrificing some performance, you gain much more portability, and could store and run the VM from any external storage.\n", "Q: Simple AppleScript script terminates early I have an AppleScript script for Music that processes the selected tracks and modifies the track name.\nBasically, it works.\nIf I select one item, it works without fail.\nIf I select multiple items, it will correctly modify the first item.

Passing by reference means that the list is stored in Music.app and the script retrieves items as needed; it also means that if the selection changes during script execution (which it probably does, since you're changing track names) it will throw off the indexes and references within the script. This might cause errors, or may just trick the repeat loop into think it has worked through all the items, when in fact they've merely disappeared from view.\nThe solution would be to dereference:\nset selectedTracks to (get selection)\n\nThis should convince Music.app to pass an explicit list at the beginning of the script, so that changes in the selection would not propagate back to the script.\n", "Q: Is it possible to list running processes that are not signed or notarized?

For example, using the last command the error must be in the names\n\"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/myusername/Pictures/\"\nor\n\"/Volumes/nameofextHD/\"\nThere is a problem with one of these names or else there are no jpgs in that directory.\nThe same applies for the other statements.

With most of the applications I use, the shortcut works, but when Chrome or Intellij have focus, nothing happens.\n\nA: Apps can enable/disable shortcuts as their developers see fit.  In fact, they can completely override system defaults and choose to ignore any custom shortcuts you may have defined.\nChrome is notorious for this.\nIn Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, it specifically tells devs to \"respect standard shortcuts.\"\n\nRespect standard keyboard shortcuts and create app-specific shortcuts for frequently used commands.

Press and hold ⌘ CommandW to close the selected Tab.\n\nIn general, don’t override standard keyboard shortcuts. Users may become confused if the shortcuts they know work differently in your app. Only in very rare cases does it make sense to redefine a common shortcut. For example, if people spend a significant amount of time in your app, it might make sense to redefine a standard shortcut that isn’t applicable to your app. Another option might be to let the user choose their own keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSo, while Apple obviously frowns upon redefining shortcuts - you still can.\nSo, why doesn't your key combo work?

Is there a way to list all of the registerd URI schemes?\n\nA: Use lsregister\nThe command can be found in /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister. I suggest creating a symlink to one of the directories in your PATH for easy access.  You can copy and past the following command for simplicity\n% sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister /usr/local/bin/lsregister \n\nNow, you can run lsregister from anywhere.\nDump the URL Binding Table\nlsregister has a number of database tables that contain various application registration details.  The table that we're interested in is URLSchemeBinding\n% lsregister -dump URLSchemeBinding\n\nThis will give you the full list from afp:// to x-man-page://.\nTo find the URL scheme used for the dictionary we can grep for it:\n% lsregister -dump URLSchemeBinding | grep \"dict*\"\ndict:               35608 (0x8b18) (0x8b1a)\nx-dictionary:       35604 (0x8b14) (0x8b16)\n\n", "Q: Can I customize how file information is displayed in Finder There are 3 things I need from Finder for my work: I need finder to be in \"Columns\" view, I need the window to be relatively small, and I need to be able to see the \"date modified\" and \"file size\" in the preview pane.\nSince upgrading to Catalina, the icon image in the preview pane has gotten so big that I can't see any of the file information without scrolling - I've cropped the image but you can see how the file information isn't visible. I found out how to get rid of the \"more\" section underneath, but I still can't see the file information without scrolling.\n\nI've tried going to View > Show View Options > Unclicking \"Show Icon Previews\", but that doesn't do anything. Basically I'd like for the preview image to be much smaller, or for the file information to show up on top.\nHere's an example of how it used to look where all the preview info was compact - this is how I'd like it to look in Catalina:\n\n\nA: You can get control of how things are shown in the Finder by clicking on the Finder icon in the dock. This should bring the Finder to the front. From there go to the View menu and click on it. Near the bottom of this menu is an option \"Show View Options\". Click on this and it opens a new panel where you can set things in the Finder View.  The image below shows the panel for setting the Finder view.\n\n", "Q: Any way to check if my AirPort card is going bad MacPro 2013? Every day for the past couple days, my WiFi on my MacPro 2013 running Mojave 10.14.6 has spontaneously vanished. The signal strength icon in the menu bar goes gray, and the status is \"Wi-Fi looking for networks\" (even though it lists all of my local networks).\nThe only solution is to reboot the machine.\nBeside simply this random crass behavior, is there perhaps something in the logs I could look at that would show some tell tales that this is, indeed, what's happening? I would like perchance some additional evidence before I drag it in to the Genius Bar with \"yea is sometimes does this\" to try and narrow down the issue.\nIn the end, they may simply swap out the card. I don't know if it will fail a diagnostic, or if it's just happy happy until it decides \"No, not happy\".\n\nA: You can use Apple Diagnostics to run a hardware check on your computer. Instructions for doing that are found here.  Your computer is on the borderline for computers using Apple Diagnostics. If you computer is from before June 2013 you have to use Apple Hardware Test. There is a link in the reference I included for this older hardware test.\nIf you are using an Apple Base Station, you can check that you have the latest software for your base station. This link describes what you should do to keep your airport base station up to date.\n", "Q: Update Safari on High Sierra Somehow Safari got reverted to v11.1.2 on my High Sierra box. I know I had 13.1.2 before. But App Store thinks I already updated so I can't click \"update to 13.1.2\".\nIs version 11.1.2 at least at security parity with 13.1.2? I'd rather update?\n\nA: Each version of Safari is more secure than earlier versions. I would suggest you upgrade to at least version 13.1.2. You should be able to upgrade Safari by going to the AppStore. Go to the app store and see if you can download a newer version of Safari.\nThis link will take you to a page where it talks about upgrading Safari.\n", "Q: Is there an app I can use to automatically track screen time for each desktop on my MacBook? I usually forget to start/stop time trackers when I'm working on different projects and tasks.\nSo I think it would be better if there is an app that can automatically track my screen time on each desktop. That means I can create a separate desktop for each task, and when I switch to it, the time tracker would automatically start. When I switch to another desktop, or when I lock the screen, or when the computer sleeps, it should automatically stop the timer.\n\nA: I don't know about a solution that tracks time per desktop but what I use is Observe (https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/). It tracks the time you spend in any application and you can add filters so screen time in one app is allocated to a specific project. You can even define working paths. So every time you work on a file in specific directory it also gets allocated to a specific project.\n", "Q: Stocks widget on mac os mojave not showing current prices About a weeks back, the stocks widget on mac os mojave stopped showing the current prices.\n\nDoes anyone know of a workaround to fix this?

I also found pages mentioning that the API got deprecated by Yahoo already years ago. Combining this with the fact that Apple deprecated Dashboard as well you may want to use other ways to access that data.\n", "Q: Using zgrep on a remote drive eats space on my local Mac I connect to a remote drive via WebDAV protocol, whereon I have a folder full of about 143 .tar.gz files containing data dumps, whereamong I'm trying to find my email.\nHerefor, I use this command:\nzgrep -a \"my@email.com\" /Volumes/storage.address.name/home/folder/Collection\\ \\#2-\\#5\\ \\&\\ Antipublic/*\n\nOnce the command is running, I can see my free space on my local MacBook, wherefrom I run the above mentioned command, disappear swiftly, like 0,5 GB per minute. If I let the command run, I would totally run out of space.\nCould someone please tell me why is this happening or how to prevent it?\n\nA: \nOnce the command is running, I can see my free space on my local MacBook...disappear swiftly...\nCould someone please tell me why is this happening or how to prevent it?\n\nOperating Locally while connected remotely\nThe command is acting upon those files as if they were local, even when they are not.  *nix systems have this wonderful feature where you can mount almost anything as if it were a local file/directory.  This \"feature\" is where you're running into this problem.\nTo operate on the file, it has to \"download\" it from the remote, hold it in memory and if necessary, resort to swap space.  If it needs to unzip it (bzip, gzip, compress, etc.) it will likely utilize a temporary file (i.e. mktemp).  Since your command is operating locally, all the resources it will utilize will be local as well - it doesn't know to use your remote for temp space.\nYou can do a simple experiment to show how this works - move a file from one remote directory to another. Using a simple mount on a NAS (/Volumes/NAS/) if you try to move /Volumes/NAS/folder1/* to /Volumes/NAS/folder2/, this simple operation will need to \"download\" the files to local machine, then upload them to the destination folder.  However, if you login directly to the server and issue the move command there - for example, mv /home/username/folder1/* /home/username/folder2, it will happen almost instantly.\nIn your case, it has to extract a number of files from each of those .tar.gz files, download them, store them in a temp location, then load it to memory for as the ASCII text is searched for.\nCleaning up Temp files...\nAn important consideration to keep in mind is that temp files are not cleaned up until the process has completed or terminated abnormally; if the developer was good about it.  If not, those temp files will be cleared out upon reboot.\nIf you have 200GB of files to search and a MacBook Air with 128GB or 256GB of storage, you will run out of space very quickly filling it up with nothing but temp files.\nHow to prevent it\nDo you operation on the server (remote machine) itself.  Instead of mounting the remote file/directory locally and operating on it locally, connect via SSH (for example) and issue your command on the remote itself.\nCan you specify a different location for the temp directory like the remote?\nTechnically yes.  For example, gzip uses /tmp and you can set your environment variable to a remote temporary directory (i.e. /Volumes/NAS/tmp).  The problem is, you're still operating on the file locally, so it would \"download\" the file, and then while extracting them, \"upload\" all the extracted bits to the remote.\n", "Q: Create a bootable NTFS drive on mac I have a working MacBook Pro as well as an old Dell laptop with no OS installed whatsoever. I'm giving the old laptop to a friend and I bought a Windows 10 license to install for them. The problem is burning the image properly!\nThere seems to be an issue in recent versions of Windows 10 where one of the files in the installer is too large for FAT32 so (unless I want to do some off-label dark magic during install, which I'd prefer to avoid) I need to burn directly to NTFS.

Some of these clients offer just the nitty gritty; iTerm2 has tons of features.  For example, some clients (like iTerm2 and Terminal) allow you to store profiles which is what configures iTerm2 and it's behavior.  You can set the background/foreground colors, the blinking of the cursor, how URLs are handled etc., but none of it is related to the actual shell on the remote computer.\nYou can have 1 remote assigned 1 profile or 100 remotes assigned to 1 profile.  Multiple profiles on your computer doesn't give you multiple users or sessions on the remote.  Multiple profiles just gives you multiple ways of interacting with the remote computer.\nWhen you Connect\nIt would be beneficial if you read my primer on ZSH files:  ZSH: .zprofile, .zshrc, .zlogin - What goes where? because it will help you in understanding  what happens when you connect to the remote machine.\nWhen you connect to a remote machine, whether it's your personal Mac or some big shared computer with many users, you are assigned a shell; assigned when your account was created.  On new Catalina installs, the shell is ZSH.  Mojave and earlier, it's Bash.  You could install newer and different shells like CSH or TCSH or even fish and then choose which one you used *when you connected or authenticated.\nWhen you log in, ZSH reads it's configuration files in order (see the above link).  It starts with the ones in /etc/ then moves onto the ones in your home directory /Users/username/.  As a side note, your home directory can be referenced as a variable $HOME or with the tilde notation; ~/ (eg: ~/Documents)\nBottom line here is that every time you invoke the shell it's going to read those files - nothing in iTerm will affect that.\nZSH History File\nZSH has no built-in setting for the history file.  It's set by environment variable, HISTFILE in any of the following: /etc/zprofile, /etc/zshrc, ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshrc.  In macOS, it defaults to .zsh_history.  You can set it to anything you want by editing any one of those four files with the line HISTFILE=foo.bar.\nEvery time you load a shell (and you can load a shell within a shell within another shell) it's going to read those files.  Again, your iTerm2 profile has nothing to do with it; your history file is going to be what you (or the admin) configured it to be.\nTL;DR\n\nFor MyUser, I set a custom location of /Users/john-doe/iTerm2/zsh (copy of zsh from /bin/zsh) and set a custom .zshrc file via the command\n\nThat's not how it works.  The user shell on the remote has nothing to do with the Terminal client's profiles.  You can't link a custom shell config file with a terminal profile the way you're trying to.  As far iTerm2 and the shell, they actually have nothing to do with each other much like the Mail App has nothing to do with Gmail's servers other than a method to connect to them.\n", "Q: I cannot export highlights from Apple Book on iOS13 I try to export highlights from a book purchased in Apple Book but when I select all my highlights, the “Share” button is still gray (so it cannot be clickable).\nWhen I try with other ePub file this method works.

This morning I woke up early and left without checking on the laptop. 8 hours later, I came back and realized the lid wasn't closing properly by a huge margin (look at picture).\nIt's like something is preventing it from closing all the way... I'm currently in vacation in a hot country and few months ago I received some warnings about changing the battery. Could it be that the battery is getting swollen and is deforming the case preventing the lid from closing properly?\nIf so is it dangerous? Will it stop getting swollen if I stop using the Macbook? I kind of want to repair it myself but I don't want to wait a month to replace the battery if it's dangerous...\nThank you for your help\n\nHere the information on the system information panel:\n\nEDIT: I Just checked on a flat surface and the bottom case is definitely deformed:\n\n\n\nA: The most obvious diagnosis at this time would be a swollen battery.\nA swollen battery can cause different symptoms from a misaligned track pad to a malformed keyboard.  In your case, it appears it's mis-aligning the case causing the lid to not close properly.\n\n*\n\n*Why is my Early 2014 MacBook Air's Trackpad Uneven?\n\n*Stiff trackpad on Macbook air\n\n*Macbook Pro mid-2015 15\" swollen battery\nA battery swells because the off gasses that are normally vented are trapped (see the first link for more info); the battery swells like a balloon.  Suffice to say, this is more than an inconvenience, this can cause something called \"thermal runaway\" where it could cause a fire.\nI strongly suggest that you get this addressed as quickly as possible.  It's impossible to predict if/when this could occur, but it is very dangerous.  You cannot put out a thermal runaway fire as the chemical reaction will continue.  This is why firefighters simply allow hybrid and electric cars to burn out; they will try to contain the fire, but they cannot extinguish it.\nAt a minimum, from a non-safety point of view, the battery is warping the aluminum structure - it could be permanently be bent, or unlike it's counterpart steel, will tear once it reaches a certain point.\n", "Q: Air plane mode schedule Is there any way to schedule airplane mode in iPhone?\nI create an automation in shortcut\nBut it’s send me a notification and I should to run that manually and it won’t work automatically.\nIs there any way!?\n\nA: \nHey Siri, turn on airplane mode.\n\nThat automates turning on airplane mode very well for me. I hope this meets your needs based on the requirements listed.\n\nA: The shortcots app is very powerful in this case. The automation can be activated/deactivated. Automation triggers are broken up into three categories: Events, Travel, and Settings. Each trigger is also either what I call \"active\" or \"passive\" in nature. An active trigger is one that is the result of a user's deliberate action, like plugging your iPhone into your CarPlay-enabled vehicle or tapping an NFC tag. At some point, you deliberately did something to or with your iPhone to start your automation.\nA passive trigger, like the time of day or arriving at or leaving a location, is one where you're not actively doing something to or with your phone. While you might leave a location with your iPhone in your pocket, for instance, your phone is passive at that moment. Ironically, these automations with this type of trigger ultimately require your active consent to run. When their trigger is activated, you'll get a notification. Tapping that notification will show you a \"Run\" button. Tap that, and your automation will run.\nIn my example, I have activate the Automation:\n\nThen you can as example automate to turn off the air plan mode by ringing the alarm clock. So if your alarm is ringing and you stop the alarm, the air plan mode will turn off. In order for this to work without confirmation after the alarm clock stopping, the \"Ask Before Running\" setting must be deactivated for this shortcut. If this is not deactivated, after your alarm clock is stopping, you will asked, if you will turn off the air plan mode. But this is not desirable.\n\nSo every time when a alarm rings and you stop them, the air plan mode will turn off and the iPhone will connect to the internet.\n", "Q: Actual working tutorial of installing catalina on an external drive? I want to know where the working tutorial for installing Catalina on an external drive is.\nAll the tutorial I managed to google up for some reason failed to mention the \"missing a firmware partition\" error.\nI tried to install it using clover or raw official installer, under a GUID scheme. All got stuck at this \"firmware partition\" gag. I tried to use apple FS but to no avail.\nWould someone please help me? This is driving me nuts.

Both running the exact same script.\nI'm not sure if there was a setting I changed or something else on the old one to disable this behaviour.\nI've read this question: How to get rid of Python Launcher icon every time a script runs? But I'm mostly confused why my old MacBook doesn't encounter this.\nThey are both running the exact same version of macOS: 10.15.6 (19G73)\nIf its important I installed Python on the new one by the installer(provided by python.org) and I used homebrew on the old one.\n\nA: Well, it sure seems the difference is caused by different methods of installing Python. If your systems are identical then its caused by Python itself. You could try installing python via homebrew on your new machine and see if the behavior changes. You should run python in a virtual environment. If you do that you can have multiple versions of python3 on your machine.\nHow are you running Python?  If you run it from the command line you may not have this happen. Are you trying to stop this behavior or are you just curious why it happens?

When I transferred it to my iPad and opened it with Notability, to my horror all the text had been removed. When I opened it in PDF Expert, it was there but the font had reverted to Helvetica. Naturally this isn't something I want, as I expect the recipient to see exactly what I'm seeing in a PDF file.\nI presume this happened because Preview wasn't embedding the font into the PDF (although strangely the file size became significantly larger, suggesting that it had). What am I doing wrong, and what's the correct way to embed a font that you use in a PDF file?\n\nA: It appears as though to embed a font in Preview (or at least to ensure that it shows up on an iPad when the iPad does not have the same font installed), you need to perform the following:\n\n*\n\n*Go to File > Print...\n\n*Click PDF on the bottom let, and click Save as PDF\n\n*Save as a new PDF file\n\nThe new PDF file will have the font correctly embedded in it. You may also be able to export as a PDF (again) directly from Preview, although I have not tried this.\nThe reason that it doesn't get \"embedded\" upon saving likely has something to do with the text fields staying editable in the PDF. Once you export the PDF, you are unable to edit the text fields any longer in Preview, but the fonts are embedded.\n", "Q: How to compress multiple folders into multiple zip files My folder structure is:\nYEAR - MONTH - DAY - SUBFOLDERS\nI want to compress each subfolder in the [DAY] directories.

I was told that for this model, they need to swap the entire keyboard and track pad  in order to replace the battery.\nCan the repair be done in the same day, or does it typically take several business days?\n\nA: I had this done on my 2014 MBP (essentially the same model) last year, and it took exactly 7 days. It might be quicker or slower, depending on how busy they are, but it is a difficult job.\n\nA: \nI was told that for this model, they need to swap the entire keyboard, track pad, in order to replace the battery.\n\nThey need to swap out the top case assembly and this consists of the case itself, the keyboard, track pad and battery.\n\nCan the repair be done in the same day, or does it typically take several business days?\n\nTechnically speaking, the repair \"can\" be done in a day.  In fact, it's a very simple repair and takes approximately 30 mins from start to completion.  However, the total process can take up to a week or more depending on where you are in the repair queue and parts availability.  If it takes more than a day, you can bet it is because they don't have the parts available.\nIt's important to remember, Apple Stores are set up to sell new products - they are not a repair facility.  There are only a couple/three  technicians that are actually qualified (by Apple) to do the repair.  They are usually inundated with iPhone/iPad repairs mostly, then computer repairs.  Having technician and parts availability is a complex process and (IMO) this is not Apple's wheelhouse.\nThey do not offer loaners.  This is why I'm a strong proponent of having a backup strategy that goes beyond Time Machine; you back up your data in multiple places so if you're without a Mac for an extended period, you can continue to work even if the temporary machine isn't Apple.\n\nA: Here are some things to consider.\nYou have no control over how many other people drop their machines off for the same repair as yours between now and when you deliver yours for service. Staffing in the stores is geared to helping people and diagnosing - not fixing. Stores routinely send out involved repairs (and battery repairs on Macs are very involved now) - harder to do than a logic board or display swap or storage / RAM fix.\nI always choose to go mail in repairs in the US now unless I have to take it to Apple. The repair centers are staffed for max parts, max labor and often they get repaired in less time than I would spend in the store parking / transit / queuing / handing off. Of course, you have overnight delivery so not all times is mail in faster, but for me it’s about 20 hours faster on average over the last 40 we’ve done for work. (We have about 3 repairs a week - most are damage and battery)\nYes - a tech could be ready, the parts could be there and you could get a same day battery repair, but with glued batteries, it’s not a 10 minute repair like hard drive swap, ram swap or battery swap used to be. It’s moving your computer from the old frame on to a new frame where the battery is glued on to the frame.\nFor any business that needs express service and loaners - check out http://jointventure.apple.com/\n", "Q: Is there a spatial map for 2020 MacBook Air track pad's right-click \"sweet-spot\"?

You can either initiate a right-lick with two fingers, or in the bottom right or bottom left corners.\nI don't know what the default is, so perhaps it's set to use two fingers, and there is no 'sweet spot'. Personally, I prefer using two fingers, as it prevents accidental right-clicks if you happen to be 'in the zone'.\n", "Q: LLDB command line installation on macOS Big Sur edition (11.0) beta I'm using the following command in order to install lldb without Xcode\n\nxcode-select --install\n\nHowever, the window that pops up with the progress bar gets halted on task \"Finding Software\"\nThose are the relevant errors I could trace from log stream:\nCode Block runningboardd: (RunningBoard) [com.apple.runningboard:process]\n[daemon<com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand(502)>:843] \nError 45 setting darwin role to UserInteractive: Operation not supported, \nfalling back to setting priority\n\nrunningboardd: (RunningBoard) [com.apple.runningboard:process] \n[daemon<com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand(502)>:843] \nError 45 setting darwin role to UserInteractiveFocal: Operation not supported, \nfalling back to setting priority\n\nAny idea how to tackle this issue?\n\nA: This is fixed on macOS 11.1 BuildVersion 20C69 (and likely before now just I haven’t tried sooner to reproduce your issue).\nYou need to run the following:\nxcode-select --install\nsudo xcode-xelect -license\n\nPress space to get to the end of the license and type agree.\nThen open Applications folder and drag the calculator app icon into your command line window after typing lldb:\nmike@m1 ~ % lldb /System/Applications/Calculator.app \nobjc[17521]: Class AMSupportURLConnectionDelegate is implemented in both ??

(Catalina retains support for the \"Mac OS Extended\" HFS+ file system.) While HFS+ was introduced in 1998 with OS 8.1 and quickly took over common usage on hard drives, it includes a \"journal\" of file system operations that makes it difficult to use with read-only drives, so CD-ROMs continued to use HFS until they were replaced with DVDs which use a different file system altogether.\nAFAIK, currently (August 2020) there are no good tools for reading HFS file systems under Catalina. A bunch of attempts at utilities that may mature over time, but nothing ready for prime time. Probably your best bet is to use a virtual machine running compatible software to read the files.\n\nUsing Virtual Box, I can see the Windows partition, but on MacOS I can’t.\n\n\n*\n\n*In general, macOS will not show the Windows partition of a multi-format CD.\n\n*You cannot use the CD drive with Virtual Box and the host macOS at the same time.

However, when I try to put a CD into it, I can just move it around and the drive does not do anything. It doesn't block the CD, but also doesn't try to pull it in or make any noise.\nIt also seems like my Mac doesn't recognize the optical drive at all; it isn't listed anywhere and system info -> burn disks says it couldn't find any drive for it.\nAny solutions for this?

Or is it something with the logic board?\nResetting the SMC doesn't help.\n\nA: The DVD Drive has died.\n\nIt doesn't block the CD, but also doesn't try to pull it in or make any noise.\n\nYou can insert media before the system has even booted.  When you turn a Mac on, it will do a scan of all attached devices (disk drives, CD/DVD drives, USB, etc.) to look for all the potential bootable media.  Macs with these optical drives will make that tell-tale noise of the optical heads moving back and forth looking to see if there's media installed.  If you're not hearing that - the drive is dead.\n\nIt also seems like my Mac doesn't recognize the optical drive at all; it isn't listed anywhere and system info -> burn disks says it couldn't find any drive for it.\n\nThis is another sign that it's dead.  The optical drive is attached to the SATA bus, so if the system can see it, it's not working.\nCould it be the logic board?\nNot likely.  As long as it gets power, the drive will \"make noise.\"  It's possible that the cable/connector to the logic board went bad, but very, very unlikely.  Since the drive is mechanical, odds favor that the drive itself is the problem.\nSo, you need to replace it (or simply remove it).  I'm assuming it's a 2010 MacBook Pro  since there was no MacBook made in 2010 and the MacBook Air doesn't have an optical drive.  iFixit has a guide for replacing the optical drive - it's fairly simple.

Any advice how I can fix this?\n\nA: You get this error message because whatever device you have plugged in wants more power than the USB bus on Mac can deliver - this is about 500mA or half an Ampre.\nCan you damage your Mac?  No.\nYou can't damage it because macOS is letting you know it disabled the port.  This is the safety feature built into the system to prevent you from damaging your Mac.\nTo solve this, you want to get a powered USB hub.\nWould a powered USB hub solve the problem of two external disks randomly losing connection or being slow?.\nIn that and your scenario, the issue can be solved by supplementing the limited power from the USB port with a hub that has an external power supply.\n\nA: I had a similar issue (maybe not the same cause) when connecting an iPad to a USB-C hub connected to a USB-C/Thunderbolt port of my M1 MacBook Pro. I solved it by using another USB-C cable: switching from the one provided by Apple with the iPad to another one I had. I noticed that in System Information, after this change, the iPad was connected through \"USB 3.1 Bus\" instead of \"USB 2.0 Bus\", and was able to draw ~900 mA instead of just 500 mA.

Being quarantined in a country where online shopping is slow and unreliable, I cannot get any new device quickly.\nAny suggestion on how to log in would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks is advance.\n\nA: A mac with no USB keyboard or mouse and no Bluetooth keyboard or mouse pairings will automatically go into pairing mode to search for a Bluetooth keyboard & mouse.\nI have not tested this with Bluetooth devices defined, but not available -- but from what I'm able to read, it should go into pairing mode if there are no input devices available.  If a display is attached, you would see the pairing window open -- so you'll know if this is working.\nIf it does not, your only option may be to use a USB keyboard & mouse (do you have any friends who have a keyboard & mouse that you can borrow for a few minutes?)\nNormally when I do this on a mac, nothing is previously paired.  This is how Apple handles non-laptop devices where the owner only uses Bluetooth input devices.\n", "Q: Cannot resize partition Mac Os I removed a container disk 1, in order to allocate more space to Container Disk 2. but still cannot increase the size of container disk 1 which is 100G. my disk capacity is 251G.\nHere is the detail of diskutil.\n\n\n\nA: To add the space from the deleted container to the existing container, the deleted container would at least have to physically reside after the existing container. In your case, this probably was not true. You can confirm this by viewing the output from the command given below.\ndiskutil info disk0s3 | grep -e Size -e Offset\n\nHere, I assume the existing container has disk0s3 as the identifier for the physical partition. If you restart your Mac, this will probably change to disk0s2. The offset should show the partition starts at around 151 GB. If so, then all the free space you created resides before the container and therefore can not be added to the container.\nApple's intent by creating APFS was for a computer to have only one APFS container. You can create additional volumes within a container and install more than one macOS operating system. If you had done this, then deleting the APFS volume(s) would have automatically made the free space available for other volumes.\n", "Q: zsh can't see and doesn't load the ~/.zshrc startup file After upgrading to Catalina and encountering the zsh upgrade reminder when launching Terminal, I've decided to switch to zsh.\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble getting Terminal/zsh to recognize the .zshrc startup file located in my home folder. ~/zshrc isn't loaded on launch, and executing source ~/.zshrc returns source: no such file or directory.\nThe file only contains one line, an alias tying python to python3.\n\n\n\nA: The issue turned out to be that .zshrc had a hidden .txt file extension. Somehow it was automatically named .zshrc.txt, probably when I used TextEdit to edit it, and source doesn't infer the text extension. Finder also doesn't display the .txt extension by default unless you inspect the file, so I hadn't noticed the issue.\n\n\nA: Somewhat similarly, my terminal/zsh wasn't recognizing my .zshrc file also, so running source ~/.zshrc helped me find that my zshrc file was formatted improperly (it contained spaces before/after an equals symbol in alias g=\"git\").\n", "Q: iMac mid 2011 reboots when connecting an external display I'm new to apple, and finally got my second hand iMac booted.\nI try to connect an external display to the iMac with an mini display port adapter.\nI have 2 adapters, 1 does nothing, the other makes my external display working (FHD and 4K), but then, the iMac reboots.\nI think this has something to do with the switching of the graphics adapter.\nI searched for a workaround to disable the AMD graphics adapter, but can't find this.\nDoes anyone has another solution, or tips for a work around?\n\nA: It is safest to treat DisplayPort as not hot-pluggable.\nOnly connect or disconnect when the computer is off.

The following command will dump the dom for a web page using Google Chrome:\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome  --headless --disable-gpu --dump-dom http://example.com\n\nI'm wondering if something similar is possible for Safari.\nI can do this with AppleScript but I'd prefer the solution for Safari to be \"headless\" (see --headless option in command above), so I think an AppleScript will not achieve what I'm looking for.\n** UPDATE **\nSelenium driver has a headless mode for other browsers. But it doesn't look like there is such a mode for safari: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314435\n\nA: I’m fairly confident Safari isn’t amenable to scraping, so use Chrome or Firefox for that on macOS if you need a browser to be scriptable.\nHowever, swift and python are exceptionally good at this by calling code directly via NSURL or equivalent as well as using the NSURLSessiond daemon and working with the OS directly and not even needing Safari.\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41517065/web-scraping-in-apple-swift-3\n\n*How to know what nsurlsessiond is downloading\nOf course you have to learn some new language and API/SDK for this to pay off.

Apple Mail, the OS bluetooth subsystem and some other applications (e.g. Fantastical) loose relevant (but not all) configuration and preferences on nearly every reboot. For Apple Mail it seems that all lost settings are stored in the file ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist. I haven't yet identified the other affected files.\nWhat could cause the file contents to be lost on nearly every reboot? It does not happen if I hunt for it (keep rebooting), but only after using the Mac for a while.\nI currently run macOS 10.15.6 on a MacBook Pro 16\" with only a few popular Apps from the App Store plus Microsoft Office.\nI am a long term Mac user. The bad behavior started approximately 2 years ago after an update to macOS High Sierra (I think). The Mac became more an more unusable because of this and other strange bugs (it also started to become extremely slow, so I had to reboot regularly, loosing all settings afterwards). Repairing and even installing the OS did not help. Therefore, I got a new Mac and installed everything from scratch (no restore from a backup) and installed only very little software on the system. However, the preferences still get lost on nearly every reboot!\n\nA: This is user level corruption or system level corruption in almost all cases. Sometimes it’s third party software, but that’s the hardest to trace, so focus on the easy steps first.\n\n*\n\n*get a backup\n\n*Make a new user account and see if that user can maintain mail settings across reboots.\n\nBased on that you’ll know if you need to address your user preferences, repair the disk, erase the disk and reinstall the os. After reinstalling, don’t set up the mac or restore the backup - just test the system with mail.\nThen decide to wipe a second time and restore files / users or if you are better off setting up a clean system just transferring documents from the backup.\n", "Q: Shell commands work in Terminal but not in Automator service I try to implement these two very simple commands in an Automator service to be run by a keyboard short (takes a screenshot and OCRs it):\nscreencapture -i /tmp/tesseract.png\ntesseract /tmp/tesseract.png stdout|tr -d \\\\f|pbcopy\n\nThis works great when I execute these commands in the Terminal, but not when I make it an Automator service (sorry this is in German).\n\nI don't understand: Why does it work in the one case and not in the other? Does it have anything to do with tesseract?\n\nA: Any executable that is not within the PATH passed to the Run Shell Script action, which is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin, you must use the fully qualified pathname of the executable.\nIn this case, e.g. /path/to/tesseract\nYou should be able to get its path in Terminal using:\nwhich tesseract\n\nAs tesseract is not a default of macOS, it may be in /usr/local/bin/, however which tesseract should report its fully qualified pathname.\n\nInstead of using the fully qualified pathname, or in conjunction with, you can also add a PATH statement to the top of the Run Shell Script action, e.g. for a bash shell:\nPATH=\"${PATH}:/usr/local/bin/\"\n\nYou could also just substitute everything to the right of the = sign for what the output in Terminal, e.g. echo $PATH is. Then the Run Shell Script action has the same PATH as Terminal.\n", "Q: iPad mysteriously sleeps when I turn away to sleep I will preface this by stating that I'm not a nut. There's a very strange phenomenon that's been happening on my iPad Pro 2017 over the past 5 months that's mildly annoying and somewhat alarming.\nRight before bedtime every night, I prop my iPad on it's stand located on my bedside table. Occasionally, I'll doze off while laying on my side while watching a video playing through the YouTube iOS app. My iPad goes to sleep within a minute after the video ends. Nothing out of the ordinary here.\nWithout fail, however, if I turn around and lay on my other side facing away from the screen, the video will stop playing and the iPad sleeps within less than a minute. I usually turn around and wake the iPad and hit the play button and the video continues where it last stopped.\nI can emphatically say it never happens when I'm facing my iPad, or at least I can't recall it ever happening. Usually, I'll turn the brightness all the way down and roll over to my other side and try listening myself to sleep. I figured the brightness level might be a factor. It's inconclusive, however, as I often leave the brightness level very low when the room is dark.\nI tried to come up with some possible explanations for this. Perhaps the iPad sleeps when it senses someone is not near the device to save energy? Possibly, but it would make playing music in the background impossible.  Could YouTube's App be the culprit?  Could it be a feature where it prevents users from using YouTube as a stereo due to licensing arrangements, or with an aim to upsell you their premium service? YouTube does prevent playing in the background and PiP, but it might require hardware access it doesn't have. Could it be a defective iPad or some strange setting? Sure, some other nefarious reasons entered my mind, but I figured I'll exhaust other possibilities first.\n\nA: Are you sure you have a 2017 iPad Pro, not 2018? It has a home button? The first possible explanation you came up with is what I'm betting is doing this, it's called Attention Aware features. But I thought it was only available on 2018 models on, with Face ID/TrueDepth camera. Though support documents only say that it's available on 11\" and 12.9\" iPad Pro, so maybe it works on 2017 12.9\" iPad Pro?\nIt thinks you're not watching so it locks itself after a while. I'm not sure why you would think this would make playing music in the background impossible, music plays whether or not the screen is locked. If you mean music videos on YouTube don't have this problem then that is bizarre and I'd love more details.\nHere's how to turn the feature off. If it doesn't show up, then I must be completely wrong.\nI'm not sure if there's a way to do so on an app by app basis, I find it pretty useful, so I wouldn't want to turn it off system-wide, but maybe it's not a problem for you.\n", "Q: Why did my 2017 12” MB go into kernel panic (page fault)?

Sometimes the hardware issues are intermittent and not caught by hardware diagnostics, and in these cases you have to wait for a pattern to appear out of multiple panics.\nThe other source of Kernel Panics, though, is the kernel software, including Kernel Extensions, which have names ending with .kext. In your case, you have VirtualBox installed, which has installed multiple Kernel Extensions. This is perfectly reasonable, but VirtualBox is free software and has been known to cause Kernel Panics in the past. (Free software, being free, is usually not as rigorously tested or as quickly fixed as commercial software, and often does not have as much official support from Apple, so is more likely to be the source of a Kernel Panic than commercial software like VMware Fusion.)\nUninstall it using the Uninstaller as explained in the VirtualBox manual. Simply moving the application to the trash will not remove the Kernel Extensions.\nThen wait and see if your computer panics again.  If it does, keep a copy of the panic and build up a history so you can look for patterns. Probably, though, it will not panic again for a long time.\n", "Q: Apple Repair Service Image of cracked bezel -or- what am I looking at? A simple battery exchange for a 2014 15\" Macbook Pro turned into a major repair - at least that is what Apple's Repair contractor claims. All I got after a very disappointing chat and call with Apple's Support Hotline was this blurry image - apparently the reason why they claim not replace the battery is that they would only to this along with repairing this:\n\nNow, this image tells me nothing but hopefully someone here has an idea what I am looking at. Would I have been able to see the defect prior to sending it off? Would the Genius at the Apple Store have seen this? MBP ran perfectly fine with the exception of the bloated battery.\n\nA: As far as I can tell from the blurry picture, it seems you're looking at the display itself and the bezel that surrounds it. If you look at the lower, right corner, you'll see that the bezel is cracked.\nWas the bezel cracked before you sent it in? - If so you had this pre-existing damage that you probably didn't declare.\nIf the bezel wasn't cracked when you sent it in, it was probably cracked during transportation. You should inform them of this to see if there's an insurance or similar that covers such an event.\n\nA: That image is hard to make out, but I trust the people in the process with Apple repair for a couple reasons. One, what's their incentive to be wrong - they get paid to repair product and make you happy. Also, they see things perfectly under inspection even if that photo is blurry.\n\n*\n\n*I would make a decision - is it worth paying for this repair?\n\nIf so, call back and say you would like them to take much higher resolution photos and see if they can cover some or all the accidental damage, but you're willing to pay if not. Leave the decision for them.\nIf not, thank them for discovering the damage and ask for it returned unprepared, again that they check with people who had custody if they noticed anything.\nOnce you have it, then it's up to you to look over things and make a call. My experience is if Apple messes up, they fess up immediately, apologetically, have a very good suggestion how to make me whole. I've not had any experience that was bad and the bloated battery could have expanded and damaged things in transit - it's not likely, but it's the most likely thing I can consider based on many years using Apple to repair work and home computers.\n\nA: Assuming that’s the display of your MacBook Pro, there are two different ways to view this:\n\n*\n\n*There’s no technical reason to repair a cracked display when replacing a top case.  While the entire MacBook Pro must be disassembled, the display is only being removed.  That same display can be reattached without any issues.\n\n\n*There’s a policy that prevents Apple and/or the ASP from working on a machine with a broken display due to the hazardous nature of broken glass.\n\n*\n\n*That display can become further damaged resulting in higher liability for the service provider\n\n*It could cause injury to the technician attempting the repair.\n\n\n\nCompanies have this policy because of a phenomenon called he who last touched it owns it.  In other words, when a technician services a product (not limited to computers) they are responsible for every issue that comes up regardless of how unrelated it is to the original issue.  If they find any damage, they will refuse to service it until you address the other issues.  Apple does this when they see the moisture detection strips indicating the presence of moisture even though there was no liquid damage or the issue isn't even related.\n\nWould the Genius at the Apple Store have seen this? MBP ran perfectly fine with the exception of the bloated battery.\n\nYes.  They are supposed to inspect the device for any damage prior to being submitted.  Every device I’ve taken in, from iPhones to iMacs, for warranty service was inspected.  They will take note of any damage.\nIf this damage was not present when you dropped it off, then you need to make that known.  However, if it was, but missed by the technician, then you’ll still be on the hook for the repair.\nNow as to being related to the swollen battery, it’s very unlikely that the swollen battery would cause this because the battery is down by the palm rest and the top of the display (when closed).  Since it appears that the damage is near the bottom of the display, it would be closer to the far end of the top case or where the logic board would be.  Your case would have to be completely distorted from a swollen battery to cause that kind of damage.\n", "Q: Instagram not available among share suggestions in iOS 13 When I wish to share a Facebook post to Instagram on iPhone running iOS 13, Instagram does not appear among the Share Sheet suggestions, not even when I hit MORE...  I have seen numerous how-tos about hitting EDIT and toggling on the applications listed under Suggestions, but Instagram is not listed at all, although I have the app on my phone and use it all the time.  How can I add it to my Share options?\n\nA: Apps get added to share when you install them. They get removed when you remove them. I would check that your app has uploaded everything to Instagram online and then remove the app.\nOnce it's gone, power down the phone.\nPower it up, and then reinstall the app.\n", "Q: Successfully launching a shell script from Finder when the path has a space in it Been trying to work this out this morning and beginning to wonder if this is even possible.\nWhen launching a shell script through Finder, either by using the extension .command or opening .sh files in Terminal, the following command is executed:\nMacbook-Pro:~ /Users/mulquin/Desktop/test/Path\\ With\\ Spaces/run.sh ; exit;\nCould not open input file: /Users/mulquin/Desktop/test/Path\n\nTrying it with quotes instead of escape characters yields the same result\nMacbook-Pro:~ \"/Users/mulquin/Desktop/test/Path With Spaces/run.sh\" ; exit;\nCould not open input file: /Users/mulquin/Desktop/test/Path\n\nThe users this is intended for are not tech savvy so asking them to open Terminal, browse to a directory and ./run.sh is unfortunately not an option.\nI had a look at Platypus but the script location will be dynamic as the users will be running it from their desktops or other location they choose.\nHas Apple really not noticed this issue or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: It turns out I was doing something wrong.\nI erroneously believed the error message was caused by Mac OS X executing the script.\nThe reason this error was appearing was because inside my script I was executing something without escaping the space. Woopsie!\n", "Q: How do I get a single file that is 22GB onto a MS-DOS FAT 30GB memory stick? A commenter has suggested that a MS-DOS FAT memory stick has a limit of 4GB for each file. I have a 22GB file that when moved or saved to the stick says it is 'too large for the format' of my 30GB memory stick. I've used the Disk Utility to help reformat/clean the memory stick (which is new by the way).\nWhat else do you suggest please?\n\nA: You can format the memory stick as ExFAT. Go to Disk Utility, click the Erase button, and select the Format as ExFAT. ExFAT supports much larger file size and you'd be easily able to copy 22GB file on a ExFAT formatted filesystem.\n\nExFAT is supported on Mac, Windows as well as Linux and any of those OS can both read and write to an ExFAT formatted filesystem.\n\nAlternate approach, if you wish to stick with MS-DOS FAT filesystem:\nYou can use the split command-line utility. The split utility comes pre-installed in macOS (I have assumed you are using a Mac).\nThe split command-line utility lets you split a large file into smaller chunks which can be managed separately. The command lets you specify the size of a chunk and the input file is broken into the chunks of mentioned size with the last chunk equal to or less than the chunk size.\nThe chunks can at a later point be re-joined to restore the original file.\nThis command-line utility comes in handy in cases where you have restrictions on file size such as yours (or such as when wanting to email a larger file which is over the limit for the attachment size allowed in an email).\nThis is how you can use the split command to break the 22GB file in question into chunks smaller than 4GB each. On your Mac, launch Terminal.app, use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you have the original 22GB file and type the following command:\nsplit -b 4000m \"original_filename\" \"pattern_name.\"\n\nwhere the original_filename is the name of the input file and pattern_name. would be the name used for chunks. The chunks would be generated as pattern_name.aa, pattern_name.ab, pattern_name.ac and so on. The output file chunks would be generated and saved in the current directory. Each chunk would be 4000m or 4000 megabytes in size, which is under 4GB. You can choose any other appropriate chunk size as well.\nNow you can copy the individual chunks on the memory sticks as they are smaller than the allowed size for the filesystem.\nAt a later point, when you want to re-join the chunks, copy the chunks onto a filesystem which supports larger file size (such as other Mac, or the same Mac in future), and run the following command:\ncat pattern_name.* > original_filename\n\nwhere the original_filename is the name/path for the output file.\nAdditionally, if you'd also want to make sure that the integrity of the file is maintained, you can derive and verify with the MD5 checksum for the original and the re-joined file.\nThe MD5 checksum for a file can be obtained by running the following built-in macOS command:\nmd5 original_filename\n\nwhich should give an output similar to the following:\nMD5 (original_filename) = 00e47d9d1414d49ab5ab3eee653ed96b\n\nThe value for checksum should match before and after the split. The value of checksum shown above would differ in your case.\n", "Q: How can I avoid iTerm trying to scp a file when ⌘-clicking it? I am working with a developer setup so that I run my code in a docker container and be able to edit it locally (via volume). Local path is e.g. /path/to/my/project while inside docker container it is /app/source.\nSay I have a file relative to the project called app/models/team.rb.\nOn an error in the container I see an output like this:\n/app/source/app/models/team.rb:13:in my_method...\n\niTerm seemed to be smart about the open on ⌘-click such that it underlined only the app/models/team.rb:13 (incl. line number) when I hover over the a of app (unfortunately only on the first character), and opened the local file in my editor (VSCode). That was already great.\nI now added an iTerm profile that identifies when a session is running inside docker (greedy: auto profile switching checking for \"&docker\") and sets the hostname and path via Triggers and regex (besides colors etc). This also works fine.\nHowever now when I hover over the filename, the whole path is underlined and when I ⌘-click, iTerm tries to download via scp (which fails).\nHow can I avoid iTerm to try to scp the file and make it realize again how to load the local file?\nI already tried not to set the hostname, but this results in iTerm not providing anything anymore for opening. When I don't set the path then it's working like before of course, but I'd like to have this information of the docker container in the status bar.\n\nA: I know this is not a direct answer to your question, but here is how I have handled the situation in other cases. Instead of mounting your local volume at /app, mount it in the container at /path/to/my/project. That way the file has the same path name inside Docker as outside it and you can skip special processing of the path name in iTerm.\nIf you are running Docker Desktop for Mac, the default osxfs driver will handle for you the issues arising from the files having different owners and permissions inside the container than outside and you do not have to worry about it.

I let the setup run for 3 hours and this happened on 5 different occasions. The Macbook was locked with Amphetamine running, the lid was closed but an external display was connected through a USB-C hub with HDMI output. I do not believe the Macbook can go to sleep under these circumstances.\nWould anyone please know how I can fix my setup to ping at regular intervals, without any large gap?\n\nA: \nThe Macbook was locked with Amphetamine running, the lid was closed but an external display was connected through a USB-C hub with HDMI output. I do not believe the Macbook can go to sleep under these circumstances.\n\nI wouldn't be so sure. Just check the output of pmset -g log | grep \"Display is turned off\" - if it happened when the ping got interrupted, you Mac went to sleep. I find Macbooks particularly stubborn when the charger is disconnected.\nAlso note that if the external display was turned off, or switched to another input, this can also be sometimes detected (depends on model/connection, I assume), so this could also trigger the sleep.\nThere's no magic switch to ping to issue  echo requests regularly - it does that by default.\n", "Q: Get a menu of windows that are open with command-` like you have with command-tab This is one of my biggest frustrations on mac, Im thinking about disabling nested windows because of it- if thats even possible\nWhen I hold command-tab I see a nice menu of the open apps I have.

The default key is either F4 or CTRL down.\nMission Control shows you all the windows in each Desktop Space, which you can select to be grouped together by application or not.\n", "Q: How can I force a crash report in OSX? My MacBook Pro regularly gets into a state where a very lightly loaded system starts processing very slowly: mouse clicks and button presses take a few minutes to process and a couple of useful things can be done in the space of a couple of hours if I'm attentive.  Note that this happens without fans or any other signal that its running close to its operating limits.\nRegardless this is undesirable.  MacOS does not seem to recognize this state as a fault or failure, so I need to manually power off, and hence I don't get the \"your system was restarted...\" message with a crash report on boot (no bugs to be had in MacOS of course).\nI have XCode installed (linux developer making due on MacOS).\nHow do I force MacOS to dump the state of the running processes and reboot?\n\nA: Activity Monitor\nIf you just want a live view of system activity, keep Activity Monitor open and change its Dock icon to CPU to see if cores are busy. You may of course open it and see what is hogging the memory/ disk/ CPU.\nYou can either enable memory column in CPU tab, or CPU column in memory tab to keep a tab :) on processes.\n\nLast time I had such a slowdown, it was spotlight processes consuming massive memory. I killed it.\nInstruments.app\nIt is bundled with Xcode app which you say you have.

System Preferences -> Profiles does not normally exist on a retail Mac. If you see that, look for an MDM Profile, that would mean your Mac is being managed by your employer. Then you can take a look at running processes that might be scanning the disk, phoning home to a server management console on-prem or in the Cloud even if you are not on VPN.\nSome companies might deploy several security endpoints and it's a real bummer as they can certainly affect system performance. In some cases quite a bit of an impact, especially the ones with kernel extensions or ones that scan the drive. Such as Symantec or Carbon Black endpoints.  There's also Tanium and Crowdstrike, etc., etc., etc.\nYou can take a look at the following paths to see what's loading daemons and background services via launchd (like systemd in Linux).\n/Library/LaunchDaemons \n/Library/LaunchAgents\n~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n/Library/Extensions (kernel extensions)\n\nIf you find the culprit is indeed a security tool you should report that to your IT department so they can escalate with the vendor and fix the problem. It should not be impacting the device like that. I've seen that sort of thing in enterprise environments quite a bit and not just on Macs.\nThe worst offenders are the ones that run disk scans updating binary signatures or scanning for viruses. Typically, when the application is updated it will run a full scan which can really work a computer pretty hard.  Eventually, it should finish the scan and performance should improve. But if it is interrupted it may start over or continue scanning some time later on.  The IT department may be running scans more aggressively than perhaps they should.\nJust something to consider as I see it all the time and with all the security threats online, every companies IT security department has been ramping up their tooling.  Especially since COVID-19 and work at home.\n\nA: I would use the following to dump and restart.\nsudo sysdiagnose && sudo shutdown -r now\n\n", "Q: Pages stuck during opening file I had a crash of my Mac right in the middle of saving a Pages document I was working on.

In addition, Finder has a difficulty showing the preview of that file - it display the contents with a very, very long delay (minutes).\nI tried to remove the ...com.apple.iWork.Pages.savedState directory, as suggested in another answer, without success.\n\nA: Just solved the issue by updating Pages to the newest version!\nThaks and excuse to everybody.\n", "Q: Demo account for Sign in with Apple for App Store Review? Does the Apple App Store review process require a demo account for signing in via a \"Sign in with Apple\" button? For example, if that is the only sign-in method, how would one create a demo account?\nThe App Store Review Guidelines state to \"include demo account info [...] if your app includes a login.\"\n\nA: Apple can use their accounts for Apple sign in.\nIf you didn’t rely exclusively on Apple for app identity, you would want to provide an account of your issuance so you can see what the testers hit. Not giving them an account makes you miss getting feedback.

I am able to connect Bluetooth of car for music and phone calls but after 2-3 minutes Bluetooth for phone gets disconnected and only music is working. Please note I am able to play music continuously.\nPlease note this was working fine since last 1.5 years before upgrading iOS 13.5, I have upgraded to iOS 13.6 but I am still facing issue.\nAlso note that I haven’t upgraded car music since the beginning, so I suspect that the issue introduced by iOS upgrade.\n\nA: Buried in the last couple of updates has been a little bug that does this. I think it is tied in with the odd MAC address changing Apple devices can do for security and hiding you from tracking.\nThe only fix I have found is to delete the pairing on both sides (phone and in-car) and then recreate it. You may get away with just deleying the connection on the Apple but I started in the car system first :-(\nSolved exactly the same issue in my Renault after about a month of the phone randomly needing reconnecting even outside a call.\n", "Q: Is it safe to close laptop while \"Shrinking APFS Data Structures\"? I just learned that the \"shrinking APFS data structures\" phase of creating a partition on a mac can take many hours, often overnight and I need to go from one place to another but I started the process just an hour or so ago. Is it safe to close the laptop while I'm on the go?\n\nA: Interrupting the operation for any reason in the middle of it, like putting the laptop in sleep might (in case of sleep) or WILL (in case of everything else) corrupt the filesystem badly.\nIt may take more or less time as it moves around the data blocks from the place which is going to be removed from the partition. Depending on the arrangement of data on your disk as well as your general storage device performance it could take anywhere from 2 minutes (I had a new partition so I fell into this case) to several hours (if a lot of data needs to be relocated).\n", "Q: iMac mid 2011 T2 secondary heatsink heating up My iMac mid 2011 started heating up about a year ago to the point that the hard drive broke and had to be replaced.\nI managed to replace the hard drive and I also replaced the power supply module as I had suspected this was the problem. I then reinstalled the correct operating system with no problem however I noticed it started heating up again.\nI then got an application which showed the heat sensors and the rpm of the fans and noticed that one of the fans, the CPU fan, was saying 0 rpm. I took my iMac apart and checked the the connections of the cpu fan with a multi meter and noticed that when one of the connections was in contact with the heat sink it started to work again.\nI assume that this connection is ground and had become disconnected to the PCB and so because the heat sink is grounded this makes the fan work when in contact. I then soldered this connection and the fan works fine ever since.\nAfter all this, fixing the fan has made the temperature cooler than what is was before but it is still hot. The Secondary T2 heat sink reaches 66 degrees after about half an hour of usage and the upper left side of the iMac gets very hot to touch. From looking at the stats application it looks as though it is the AC/DC power module which heats up because the 'T2 AC/DC Sec heat sink' and the power supply temperature sensors get to around 60 degrees which is not normal and all the other temperature sensors are normal temperatures.\nI have no idea how to fix this so any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: This is not a problem. I have a 2010 iMac with an HDD and I have Temperature Gauge 4.1. It reports the temperature at 14 different locations in my iMac. My computer is basically idling right now. 9 of the 14 locations have a temperature that is over 60°C, with the Power Supply Heatsink reporting 75°C. The locations that are not reporting temperatures over 60°C are at 55-59°C. So 60°C is not a problem. The Average CPU temperature on my machine is reported as 59°C. One fan is maxed out and another almost maxed out. This is normal for my older iMac. The left side of my iMac also gets very hot to the touch.\n", "Q: 2015 MBP (Thunderbolt 2) output to Thunderbolt 3 Dock I have a 2015 MBP (Thunderbolt 2), and I want to output to a new Thunderbolt 3 docking station. The new dock is connected to 2 monitors.\nSeems like what I need is a male to male Thunderbolt2 to Thunderbolt3 cable. But, from googling around, doesn't seem like such a cable exists.\nI see USB C to Mini DP male to male. But that's used for new laptops (USB C) to drive older displays (Mini DP).\nI also see that Apple provides a Thunderbolt 3 to 2 dongle.\nhttps://www.apple.com/us_smb_83039/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nThunderbolt 3 is male, Thunderbolt 2 is female. So I guess I could connect a Thunderbolt 2 cable from may MBP to the dongle. But even then, I'm not sure if that would work. Also, I'm not sure if it'd be driving 1 display or 2.\nCan anyone help?\nThanks\n\nA: Get a proper Thunderbolt 2 dock.\nThe problem that you’re going to have is that Thunderbolt 2 does not provide all of the bandwidth and capabilities necessary to support what’s on the Thunderbolt 3 dock.\nUsing a USB-C dock with older MacBook Pros\nThose Thunderbolt 2 to thunderbolt 3 adapters are great for when you’re using a single use items like an Ethernet port or a Firewire adapter. Thunderbolt 3 has double the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2 -  40Gb/s versus 20Gb/s. You simply will not be able to support everything that the newer dock supports.\nWhat’s also important to keep in mind is that the Thunderbolt 2 uses an active cable where as Thunderbolt 3 does not. So right off the bat trying to connect this dock to your older MacBook Pro will likely not work.\n\nA: According to this Macworld.com article here you can use backwards compatibility by making sure that the dock you purchase is EXTERNALLY POWERED in order to supply access and power to the down-streamed device.

I also don't want all traffic going over the VPN.\nSo here's what I have so far:\n\n*\n\n*Something needs to work at the application layer to 'capture' all traffic from an application.\n\n*Something else needs to work at the network layer to take all of that traffic and push it over the VPN.\n\nAnd then I need a way to specify which apps and which interface, and be sure that if that interface is down or disconnected, no traffic flows.\nSo far I think this might be doable with pf (I found Murus, a GUI front-end), except that it doesn't seem to deal with applications per-se, but rather networks and ports, which as stated above is problematic.\nThen there's Little Snitch, which deals with applications but is a binary go/no-go decision maker, rather than directing some traffic here and some traffic there.\nThat said, I did find a not-well-documented feature where it seems like you can create a rule for a process in Little Snitch, and give it access to pf. So perhaps there's a way to write a pf rule that then directs that traffic over the VPN.\nOpen to suggestions.\n\nA: This feature is available from Private Internet Access. They call it their Desktop Application Split Tunneling Feature. It is a complex enough feature that I would not expect it to be supported by free software.\n", "Q: iPad 4th not recognised when connected via USB-C Apple Digital AV Multiport Adapter on Catalia If I connect my iPad 4th generation to the MacbookPro 2020 with Catalina 10.15.6 directly via USB-C cable, everything works well: the iPad shows in the finder.\nIf I do the same, but I plug the usb-c cable in the Apple Multiport adapter (last generation), nothing happens.\nAny idea what is going on?\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: The Apple Multi-port adapter only provides power via the usb-c out connection.\nYou could use the older USB-A port to get USB 3 speeds if needed THOUGH early iPads top out at USB 2 on the Lightning adapter.\nFull details of the connector are on the Apple site here\n", "Q: Getting AppleScript function to pass string correctly Someone please help me here and show me how to get this to work.

So, after talking to him I tried checking why the name was not displayed, I found that his contact was no more in my contacts (only \"siri found in apps).\nWhat could be the reason? Is there any chance that I got something malicious in my Iphone?\n\nA: In my personal experience, the issue might be an iCloud syncing problem or somehow the main group in your Contacts app has been unselected.\nTo check to see if all of your Contact groups are selected, open the Contacts app and tap on the groups button on the top left corner.  You should see a checkmark next to the groups that are selected.\nIf this is not the issue, then you might want to go to iCloud.com to see if your contacts are at least stored on the cloud.\nTo answer your last question, yes there is a chance that something malicious could be occurring but it is very improbable unless someone managed to hack your Apple ID.\n", "Q: Spotlight Search: Show ALL FILES, and exclude ALL FOLDERS I am looking for a macOS equivalent of the Windows command:\ntype:NOT\"file folder\" \n\nThis command, when entered into Windows Explorer search bar, will display all the files of a directory or hard drive, without showing the folders in the search results.\nThanks.\n\nA: The Spotlight query you need to use the \"kind\" attribute.

The only thing I could find was \"Overvoltage shutdown protection\", but I wouldn't know why there would be an overvoltage. Disconnecting the charger and using the battery doesn't help.\nResetting the SMC seems to help, but after a month or so the problem starts occurring again. I ran an Apple Hardware Test (both regular and extended version) and it doesn't find any issues. What can be causing this? Is it an issue with the motherboard?\nJust to make sure: Is it possible that it's the 6Gbps SSD (Samsung 860 EVO) that I installed (while my Mac officially only supports 3Gbps), somehow messing things up?\n\nA: On a ten-year-old laptop with a non-removable battery, I suspect that the battery chemistry has aged to the point that it can't reliably provide an appropriate supply of power. I'm vaguely surprised that it's over voltage protection, but the chemistry of an aging battery is a complex topic.\niFixit indicates that you can get a replacement battery for $95 and that the replacement process is easy (only five steps!).

Very useful and works great (after installing the command line tools) for a lot of my pictures that have the correct modification date, thanks.  What I am looking for now, is a syntax for \"content created\" date that I could use?\nAny help on this would be great.\n\nA: Using tools that are part of macOS, We start by getting the ContentCreationDate from the file and place it into a container ccd -\nccd=$(mdls -raw -n kMDItemContentCreationDate FILE)\n\nNext, We format the ContentCreationDate string into a string usable by SetFile and place that into a container nct -\nnct=$(date -f '%F %T %z' -j \"$ccd\" '+%D %T %z')\n\nFinally, We use SetFile and set the FSCreationDate to the modified date/time string from ContentCreationDate -\nSetFile -d \"$nct\" FILE\n\nI'm assuming that you know how to place all of this into a loop for processing multiple files.\nNote: Look into exiftool\n\nA: As you mentioned, this command works great to automatically convert both the \"File Creation\" and \"File Modification\" dates to the \"Content Created\" date.\nexiftool \"-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal\" *\n\nBut a little warning to those unfamiliar with the terminal, this command will do so to every file in the user directory by default. If someone has a specific folder they want to run this on, better to first use the \"cd\" command into the folder they want.\nAlternately, you can just paste (not hit enter, just paste) the command without the asterisk into a terminal window:\nexiftool \"-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal\"\n\nAnd before running the command, go back to Finder, select the files you want, and literally drag the files into the terminal window. It will auto-populate with the lists of files and then you can run the command, only affecting the files you chose.\n\nA: And for something totally different that uses only basic commands, you can do this:\n# mv OriginalFileName.jpeg TempFileName.jpeg\n# touch -t 199912310000 OriginalFileName.jpeg\n# cat TempFileName.jpeg > OriginalFileName.jpeg\n\nThe basic system commands don't really want you messing with the creation date, because, well, it is the creation date, which should really be considered immutable!\n(Why use touch when there are good examples here using SetFile? Well, the dates used by SetFile must be in the \"Unix Epoch,\" which means they must be between 1970-01-10 and 2038-01-18. If that works for you, fine, but I have a lot of scanned photographs and PDF documents from before 1970, and touch will set creation dates outside of the UNIX Epoch, back to 1900. In addition, the formatting is tricker for SetFile, which does not use ISO Standard date/time formatting.)\nSo this solution basically copies the file, creates a file at a given point in time, then copies your original file's contents into the created empty file.\nYou can easily package this into a shell function and store in your .bashrc file for easier use:\nfunction recreate {\n    mv \"$2\" /tmp/file_to_recreate\n    touch -t $1 \"$2\"\n    cat /tmp/file_to_recreate > \"$2\"\n}\n\nNow you can simply type recreate 199912310000 MyPhoto.jpg and your function will \"re-create\" the file with the desired creation date.\nThe touch command with the parameter \"-t\" takes a date time in the following format: YYYYMMDDHHmm. You must enter all characters. Non-existent dates are silently accepted without error, and produce unpredictable arbitrary dates.\nI use this for photographs, yes, but also I set the creation date to the copyright date on PDF books I collect.\nI have a lot of scanned slides and photographs that don't have an internal EXIF creation date, so I haven't included updating EXIF data from the file creation date in my function.\nInstead, I do the opposite: I use GraphicConverter, which has the best access to EXIF/IPTC data I've seen in any regular (non-Terminal) application. It can batch-set the EXIF internal creation date to the file creation date with just a couple mouse clicks.\nGoing the other direction — setting the file system creation date to the file's internal EXIF creation date — will require exiftool.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: A \"time out\" means that a command was sent and the system is waiting for a response but didn't get one. Instead of waiting forever, a period of time is hard coded into the utility (diskutil) to wait and once it's reached, it generates the error.\nAlso, when you see \"invalid request\" as a response from your disk it means that the controller didn't understand what was supposed to be very much valid.  These two conditions are indicative of a failing (or failed) hardware.\nIf you have a failing component like the SATA controller on the drive (it's what bridges the SATA interface on the logic board to memory modules in the SSD), you'll never get it working. It may be intermittent where it works for a while but then fails again.  It's like having transmission where all gears but one have some broken teeth on them. You can change the fluid all you want and reprogram the transmission computer, but it won't fix the broken part(s). You might get it working (the unbroken teeth on the gears line up), but hardware failures are pretty much permanent; it'll fail again.\nWhat will happen is you'll have a nice clean \"fixed\" drive ready to fail at the worst moment. It's better to just spend the $40-60USD and get a new drive and have the piece of mind your data is not at risk.\nPossible Recovery\nYou might still be able to recover the data, but I don't advise doing it on the device itself.  Instead, make an image of the drive and work off of that.   You will need:\n\n*\n\n*A working MacBook that one with a new SSD and clean install is fine.  You can also use a friends.  One that you can leave alone for a while to do recovery operations\n\n\n*A USB3 to SATA cable. This will allow you interface with the drive without having to open up a Mac to connect it to the SATA bus.  Ideally, you want USB3 for the higher transfer speeds.  You can use USB2, but it will take considerably longer.\n\n\n*Recovery Software like DiskDrill (I've used this personally with very good success) or Disk Warrior (other have reported success).  The diagnostic features of these utilities are free so you can use them to see if the data is recoverable. If you want to recover the data, you can purchase a license key that will unlock it.  If you're data isn't recoverable then you're not out any money.\nYou want to work on an image instead of the device itself.  Stressing out the drive can only compound the problem. It's like our transmission with broken teeth on the gears - continuing to run it will only make it worse, not better.  Same with electronic components - there may be no more spinning drives, but passing electric current, which generates heat through failing components isn't doing them any favors.\nYou can use the built-in dd command to make an image.\n$ sudo dd if=rdiskX of=/path/to/disk.img bs=4M\n\nThis will make an image of your drive wherever you decide to put it (i.e. your Desktop - ~/Destktop/disk.image).  Then run your recovery software on the image.  Note:  This is a \"set it and forget it\" type of operation so, it's going to take some time.  But, once you have the file, you'll be able to copy it and move it and do your operations on it without running the risk of further data loss.\n", "Q: File don't show with \"ls -a\" but was detected by Malwarebytes On the terminal, I search for the file com.pplauncher.plist on the directory\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\nthrough the command ls -a, but such a file wasn't found.

I thought every file on my computer could be shown on the terminal.\nPS: I was trying to delete this file because I found mshelper running on my iMac, which turns out to be a malware used to mine cryptocurrency.\n\nA: I would do the directory listing as root or with a sudo.

When I open \"System Report:\", I see these lines under Graphics/Displays:\nDisplays:\n  LG HDR 4K:\n    Resolution:                     3840 x 2160 (2160p 4K UHD - Ultra High Definition)\n    UI Looks like:                  1920 x 1080 @ 30 Hz\n    Framebuffer Depth:              30-Bit Color (ARGB2101010)\n    Mirror:                         Off\n    Online:                         Yes\n    Rotation:                       Supported\n    Connection Type:                DVI or HDMI \n    Adapter Firmware Version:       7.55    \n\nWhat is this \"UI Looks like\"? Is there a way to get the full resolution of my screen?\n\nAdditional information. Thanks to @Alex for a solution that worked.\nExamining the EDID data from the monitor, I see that its native resolution is 3840x2160. This is the resolution reported by \"About this Mac/System Report\". The \"UI Looks like\" half of that resolution. The Mac's native display is 5120 x 2880, which probably explains why the text was smaller and more stuff was fit onto the screen.\nGoing to Settings > Displays and selecting the \"Scaled\" checkbox allowed me to choose settings that made the text look more like what I expected on the machine's own display. Going back to \"About this Mac/System Report\" now shows the external display to be 6016 x 3384 and the \"UI Looks like\" value is again half of that resolution. I don't know if \"About this Mac\" is lying to me, or it really got the monitor up to that resolution.I was actually able to push it all the way to 6720x3780.\nWhen I chose the very highest resolution, the resolution actually went back down to 3840x2160 but now the \"UI looks like\" was full 3840x2160 resolution.\nHonestly, all I really wanted was for the Mac to put the monitor into its native resolution and then adjust the text height and other scale values to make it look right. But whatever. At least I can make it look good.\n\nA: Go into System Preferences --> Display\nSelect Scaled\nPick one of the options - under the monitor icon it'll tell you the resolution. As others have said, Apple will automatically scale the display, but you can choose \"More Space\" to get a true higher resolution.\n\n", "Q: Eject on menu bar shows \"No Drives\" even though an external drive is connected I have an external drive connected to my mac and I'm able to eject it from the finder window or the desktop like usual.\nFinder:\n\nDesktop:\n\nBut, I would like to be able to eject it from a menu bar icon.

I have seen comments in various posts here to the effect that HDMI is to be avoided.\nCan anyone explain what the problem is with HDMI, and why it's a bad thing?\nMore specifically, I have a 2nd monitor with three inputs: HDMI, DVI, and VGA. I'm currently using the HDMI port, connecting directly with the HDMI port on my Mac mini.\nIs there any reason why I should use some sort of adaptor from one of the Thunderbolt ports to the DVI instead?\n\nA: HDMI is an AV (Audio/Visual) interface that is designed for consumer devices.  DisplayPort is focused on the computer industry.  As such, one functions better in a compute environment than the other.\nFounders and Industry Adopters/Supporters\nHDMI:\n\nThe HDMI founders were Hitachi, Panasonic, Philips, Silicon Image, Sony, Thomson, RCA, and Toshiba. Digital Content Protection, LLC provides HDCP (which was developed by Intel) for HDMI. HDMI has the support of motion picture producers Fox, Universal, Warner Bros. and Disney, along with system operators DirecTV, EchoStar (Dish Network) and CableLabs.\n\nDisplayPort:\n\nDisplayPort (DP) is a digital display interface developed by a consortium of PC and chip manufacturers and standardized by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor, and it can also carry audio, USB, and other forms of data.\n\nOne was developed by consumer electroncs manufacters and supported by movie and television studios as well as cable service providers.  The other was developed by PC and chip manufacturers with standardization provided for by the long standing VESA.\nThis is further reiterated by PC World article from 2019: HDMI vs. DisplayPort: Which display interface reigns supreme?\n\nThough you’ll find it [DisplayPort] alongside HDMI on most late-model, high-end video cards, as well as in Macs and laptops marketed to business users, it rarely appears in Windows PCs aimed at consumers. It’s also rare as hen’s teeth in consumer electronics devices.\n\nEmpahsis mine\nYour Mac\nYour Mac has been using DisplayPort whether it was the native mDP (mini DisplayPort), the Thunderbolt (1, 2 or 3) port or the USB-C port in Alternate Mode.  Only a few Mac computes had native HDMI ports (i.e. Mac mini).\nSo, going from native DP to DP is going to be the most reliable connection.  There's no conversion.  No conversion = higher reliability.\nConverting the Signals\nThe signaling of HDMI and DisplayPort are very different.  It's not just re-aranging the pin outs of the display signals, the voltages and the presence/absence of a clock sync all contribute to the reliability of the signal.\n\nDisplayPort was designed to replace VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), and FPD-Link. The interface is backward compatible with other interfaces, such as HDMI and DVI, through the use of either active or passive adapters.\n\nYes, you can convert a DisplayPort signal to HDMI, but I don't recommend it.  Again, no conversion is better, but if you must use HDMI, use an active adapter because it recreates the actual HDMI signal including the clock signal.  A passive adapter cannot do this.\n\nMy Opinion on HDMI\nPersonally, I find HDMI very flaky especially when it comes to audio.  On every single HDMI interface (non-computer) in my house, regardless of how new or old the equipment is, audio will drop out.  The fix is to switch to another input and switch back.  Apparently, it gets out of sync and the switching of inputs \"re-syncs\" it.\nFrom a computer perspective, in the office, we've had mixed results.  Some computer to HDMI connections work flawlessly.  Others only get a blank or blue screen.  I resolved it by getting active adapters.\nHowever, my greatest experience came when trying to convert a MacBook with a broken LCD (re-purposing a student computer) for a digital signage project.  The 55\" Television only had HDMI and I simply couldn't get the MacBook to talk to the TV properly.  I had to get a PC with a video card with HDMI to make it work and at least twice a week, I had to reboot it because the signal became corrupt.  However, the Mac that I had attached to the Dell monitor via DisplayPort ran for months without issue - the only reboots came when we had to apply updates or change the content.\n", "Q: How do I get this Mac G5 up and running ? (boot to OS) A local Goodwill sells Apple hardware at ridiculously low prices, great for a tinkerer like me. I'd missed the Mac mini on sale so I grabbed this Mac Pro looking device thinking it would be an intel running unit. The $25 price tag and wire tie kept me from opening. the cover to confirm and they don''t offer refunds.\nWhen I opened it at home the plastic cover inside had the great big G5 on it and my heart sank. No hard drive or memory. The little sticker started off showing it as a single 1.6. DDR3 or DDR2 or DDr4 memory didn't seem to fit, but I did shoehorn two sticks of 2gb into two slots. There is a 500gb drive attached inside without rails. Both are to test. There is what seems to be t he optical drive still in the front bay.\nI haven't figured how to open the  'apparent' optical drive else I'd searched for an old Apple Mac OS dvd to try. Also I'd have. thought I'd get other than a black screen when turning it on.\nWhat do I need to do to just get it booting into an OS ?\n\nA: Software - You need to get an old OS X install CD, boot from it, and install. Depends a little on the specific Mac you have, but you can check sites like eBay. You can find more info on sites like: https://lowendmac.com/\nTo open the CD tray - hold the left mouse button on boot - it should pop open for you.\nShoehorning RAM into a slot doesn't sound healthy. If it came with a stick of RAM, take out your new RAM and leave what was there in it, and try booting. Putting in an unknown stick, at least till the box is up and running is going to be another potential headache.\n", "Q: Unable to use Audio Midi Setup to use two audio outputs I used to have an aggregate device where I would have my audio output coming out both my Bluetooth headphones and my built-in speaker. (Weird, I know. I used the setup to play along with musical recordings.) Suddenly one day it just stopped working, so I delete the aggregate device and tried to make a new one. But I'm unable to get the sound to come out of both devices.\n\nThe sound only comes out of whatever subdevice I have listed first.

So if you don’t have a local caching service or aren’t on fast internet - add 15 minutes for the download. Your customization and amount of apps governs the migration script timing, but it’s almost always faster to get a clean install than pick apart how your mac is broken in my expierience).\n", "Q: How can I be getting updates on the location of my lost iPad if the device is WiFi-only, with no cell phone hardware? I lost my iPad mini (current model, 5th generation, running iOS 14 beta), the model that is equipped only for WiFi. This is the model of iPad mini without any cell phone hardware.\nWhen I checked now using Find My on my iPhone, Apple reports contact with the iPad only a half-hour ago, showing a current location on the other side of the city. But I've not been on that side of the city for hours.\nWhere I lost the iPad, there are no WiFi networks that I have ever given permission for the lost iPad to join.\n➥ So how can Apple's server's be reporting contact with a Wifi-only iPad with no previously-joined WiFi network available?\nI understand that a WiFi-only iPad can determine its location by scanning for nearby WiFi routers. But how does a WiFi-only iPad communicate that location back to me via Apple if the iPad has no authorized WiFi network connection?\n\nA: *\n\n*Apple devices join networks for setup by default so any open network would work even enter resetting your SSID / network preferences. I’m not sure you can be certain some SSID wasn’t joined without forensic details, but let’s set that more obvious cause aside.\n\n*Apple devices use handoff to talk amongst themselves without any WiFi based station. You’ve enabled this by signing in to iCloud from what I can tell based on Apple’s documentation and experience.\n\n*Apple devices have offline location functionality built in as well as last known location reporting.\n\n\nFind My can help you locate a missing device — even if it’s offline and sleeping — by sending out Bluetooth signals that can be detected by Apple devices in use nearby. These devices then relay the detected location of your device to iCloud so you can locate it in the Find My app. It’s all anonymous and encrypted end-to-end so no one, including Apple, knows the identity of any reporting device.\n\nAny one of these will update location and all could be in play based on your situation. Find My has many ways to establish a location report as opposed to the initial functionality of find my iPhone from June 2010 and iPhone 4s.

How can I fix my issue to allow me boot from the flash drive?\n\nA: You can try to run the installer on your USB directly in Recovery mode.\nOpen up terminal and run ls /volumes. Identify your USB, and then run /volumes/<USB Name>/Install\\ macOS\\ Catalina.app/Contents/MacOS/InstallAssistant. The macOS installer should appear.\nIf it did not launch, you can copy your installation partition on the USB over to your internal drive. In Disk Utility, you can create a new partition on the internal drive and \"restore\" the USB drive to the new partition you just created. Then, select your internal installation partition as a boot drive and proceed to standard installation.\n\nA: I am going to guess you ended up with a firmware password and aren’t seeing the images here due to some removals of OS that the system expected.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\nIf so, you will need to get Apple to unlock the device by providing original proof of purchase if you can’t recall and enter the passwords that were entered into the T2 / Secure Enclave. The T2 encrypts the storage with a device key and as you add admin accounts, their password and identity is asssociated with the key to unlock the storage so you would normally provide that admin password to retrieve the key to make a change. This doesn’t really need an admin user - just one authorized to perform the storage unlock and change the boot sequence. Typically that’s an admin since typically only one account is on a Mac out of the box.\nThe good news is your hardware is fully capable of internet boot, so I would try recovery from the internet to drop on macOS and see if you can unlock and configure things with a new OS from Apple being trusted and installed.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nSupporting Macs at work, we override all three of the items in the KB you reference with Internet Recovery and an erase. For firmware passwords, unless we have an MDM unlock, we do go to Apple service for that just like consumers do in the end, but it’s rare we lose control of most devices in that manner. Hopefully you get a trusted install from the internet and can reinstall Catalina without using USB.\n\nA: The disk (that you erased) contains a 'Secure Token' for the admin user. You need to recreate it before you can change the settings.\nFirst, reinstall the OS using Internet Recovery.

I kind of didn't expect this to help as the issue appears to be with \"Mac A\".\nI don't know what else to try next with this. Does any one have any ideas on what to try?\n\n\nA: I don’t have a fix, but I know this has come up. Also, this is going to be very hard to reproduce your conditions, so it might be a while to solve this. Here’s how I would troubleshoot this, based on a layered approach:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure AirDrop works bilaterally - photos / web page - share back and forth.\n\n*Make sure Handoff works bilaterally - safari and messages are good to test\n\n*Make sure WiFi handoff works - this uses Handoff to store an item in Keychain / System Preferences\n\nSo, for most people, I would expect handoff is the broken piece here and not that the keychain or system preferences app are broken for you.\nAlso - when A/B testing, it’s very useful to have a C to test - iPhone / iPad or another Mac.\nGood luck - with so many variables, you may need a piece of paper or spreadsheet to test the various apps in the various configurations, but WiFi sharing layers on top of handoff which layers on top of AirDrop with iCloud identify certificates to allow Handoff to work. Hopefully you can eliminate iCloud as a cause by signing out and in, but clearing the keychain of signing / identity certificates might be needed - especially if iCloud syncs these down to the Mac A after you erased it.\n", "Q: Import Albums \"From my Mac\" to my iPhone albums and keep them synced I don't use iCloud Photos. I wanted to import my iPhone photo albums to my Mac but it seems that without iCloud Photos it is not possible without any third party software according to my searches.\nBut I've found that I can create albums on Photos on my Mac and then sync with my iPhone. So I took time to recreate albums on my Mac. I factory reset my iPhone and then sync with my Mac. All the photos are back, even the albums, great.\nBUT, the albums on my iPhone are \"hidden\" in the \"From my Mac\" section. Not in \"My Albums\". And I can't add photos to these albums on my iPhone. I could select all the photos and add them on a newly created album on my iPhone with the same name but.. I guess it will be out of sync.\nIs it possible to keep the albums between my Mac and iPhone synced AND have the possibility to add photos to these albums on my iPhone ? Without iCloud Photos.\nI've searched for a solution for the past two days and I don't know what to do anymore.\nIt is supposed to be simple.. isn't it ? :(\nThanks\n\nA: Ok technically I've found the answer : no.\nIt seems that due to iOS limitations, you can't edit album that are created outside the iPhone.\nSo I'll try to achieve my goal by managing photos manually.\nThe problem is : Photos crashes during the export. I'll ask another question for that.\n", "Q: \"Moving\" MP3s from one mac book to the next? I imported my private MP3 collection (basically ripped from the CDs I bought years back) on my Mac into iTunes some years back. On my \"Music\" directory, I basically see my folder private, where I put my MP3 files with 15 GB, and iTunes, also with 15 GB. I guess that is where iTunes stored all the data after import.\nI use the Music app1.0.6.10 on macOS Catalina 10.15.6 now instead of iTunes.\nI am about to replace that old Mac book with a new one. My plan is to  copy that private folder onto the new machine, and import again but I worry it won't that like \"double\" all the existing entries.\nI saw this very old question, but I am rather looking for a more basic explanation about \"option space\", and best practices.\nHow do I get the same MP3s into Apple Music these days?\n\nA: By default, iTunes/Music copies audio files to /Music/iTunes. If you've got 15 GB of music in two locations, then you've probably got them duplicated already.\nWhen you get a new Mac, you can use Migration Assistant to copy all your files and settings, and the process will be handled automatically for you.\nIf you don't want to use Migration Assistant, you can just copy the 'iTunes' folder inside /Music. The new app will update its Library database will all your data.\n", "Q: Identify tower being used in iOS At my cottage field test mode tells me I am -116 dB. I need a booster with a yagi.\nThe problem is where to aim it. There are two towers about the same distance but very different directions.\nIs there anything in field test that lets me identify the exact tower I’m using?\n\nA: I like to just do speed tests as you adjust the antenna when I don’t have a software defined radio and/or oscilloscope to measure the actual signals.\nI’ve not seen any good tool that uses the compass or just shows that weak a signal since the noise is so large compared to the signal.\nSo, no - you’ll need to try them sequentially and also sight things visually or do even more measurements.\nHopefully someone has a better guide to field test, it’s so changeable based on hardware I try to do anything else but use that anymore. It was great when ATT and iPhone original came out, but after a while it’s needing a PHD to decipher.\n\nA:  Signal Reborn\nIf your device is jailbroken, you can use Charlie While's Signal Reborn on Packix. This will show the tower your device is connected to and other towers that your phone has previously seen, which can be filtered to only show towers for your carrier.\n\nIts main purpose is to map out all the cell towers that are in your local area. It does this through all on device measurements, meaning it's always up to date. The tower you are currently using, will have a green outline, and a green line going to it.\n\n\n", "Q: (macOS) Two windows side by side: is there a way to allow stretching one window to minimum width? My daily case: I usually have .pdf viewer for articles + MS Word side by side and Web browser + markdown side by side.\nMy struggle is windows stretching - for example, when I read .pdf I would like to shring MS Words window to minimum, however, macOS allow me to like 35 % (my guess), some goes for the Web browser + markdown.\nIs there a way to set the stretching percentage of each window?\nThis is an illustration of my question:\n\n\nA: You can do this with Applescript. Set the boundaries for the front window to be a certain width. Then after clicking on the window you want to shrink, run your Applescript. Name your script something like narrow_front_window.sc.  The script could look something like:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set the bounds of the front Finder window to {36, 115, 511, 674}\nJust run the script after bringing window to the front.  The widows do have a minimum size.\n", "Q: iOS VPN configuration: which ip do apps see? If I have a VPN configured on my iPhone, which ip address is accessible by some other app on my phone? For example, if I use some news app, will the app's server know my true ip address or the ip assigned by the VPN?\n\nA: Apple doesn’t really tell applications much about vpn since there are other ways to check if a resource on the internet is reachable, so most apps just check what they want to access is available or try to request something and then indicate waiting or failure.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/49581\nIt really depends how smart a programmer is if they track any or all interfaces and also match up your request to their server logs which will show your NAT address in all cases.\nIt also depends on the VPN if it’s app specific or system general and split tunnel exposes multiple network interfaces to each app in practice.\n", "Q: How can I turn off internet access for Mac apps I'm trying to disable the internet for some apps, specifically Origin because it always requires an update before I can play a game. I tried turning off internet access in the Firewall settings for Security.\nI turned off Origin and chrome but both still have internet access. Restarting the computer did not do anything either. I'm still able to access internet sites on Chrome.\nBoth chrome and Origin are not installed via the App Store.\nI'm running MacOS Catalina 10.15.6 and am always using the wifi to connect to the internet. I would like to keep my internet for the rest of the computer.\n\n\nA: The firewall settings you have tried to configure apply to incoming connections only - this is why it is not working for you.\nBasically a program on your computer can initiate a connection to an external computer, which is known as an \"outgoing connection\".\nSimilarly a program on an external computer can initiate a connection to a program on your computer, which is known as an \"incoming connection\".\nIn both cases, data can flow both ways as soon as the connection is established. That is a program can initiate an \"outgoing connection\", and receive lots of data on that \"outgoing\" connection.\nIn order to do what you want, you'll want to install a program such as Little Snitch, which can block network connections from programs such as Origin.\n", "Q: ITunes and Catalina If I upgrade to Catalina will I still be able to import songs? If there is no iTunes were are the MP3 files going? Can I still bring music from my mac to use my iPods?\n\nA: Yes, the new Music application has taken on the music-related roles of iTunes. You can sync music to an iPod Touch from the Music application, but for an iPod Classic I think you’ll need to use Finder, and you may need to reformat it — see this thread.\n", "Q: How to reinstall Mac OS Snow Leopard from Grub I tried install Ubuntu on the internal hard drive of my iMac and now want my iMac running Snow Leopard again\nI can acquire a Snow Leopard ISO and burn it on to a CD through using my laptop. I don't know if that helps but I have that option. Grub does come up when I boot the Mac initially. But then I don't know where to go from there. Would it be wise of me to install the Windows 10 first that I have or should I just install the Mac image that I have?\n\nA: Either the Mac came with installation media which you can boot on (may need to press C or D while booting), or it has a rescue partition built in you can boot from using Command-R while booting (see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314)\nThen proceed to use Disk Utility to completely wipe the drive, and then install MacOS/OS X.\nFull details on https://support.apple.com/da-dk/HT204904\n\nA: By stating \"again\", I assume you had Snow Leopard installed at some previous time. Apple currently posts: You can hold down the Option (⌥) or Alt at start up to boot to the Startup Manager, which allows you to choose other available startup disks or volumes. In this case you should select the optical drive containing the Snow Leopard DVD. Another option would be to hold down the C key at startup.\nIn your question, you did not state the exact model of your iMac or the version of Snow Leopard, therefore there is no guarantee the version of Snow Leopard is compatible with your iMac. For example, if the iMac is a 27-inch, Mid 2010 model (which came pre-installed with Snow Leopard OS X 10.6.3) and the version of Snow Leopard is OS X 10.6.0, then I would assume this version would not be usable.\nIf you do get Snow Leopard installed, then you should install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1. You may have problems downloading using the iMac with Snow Leopard installed. You probably will want to download to a USB flash drive using Ubuntu on the iMac or your laptop.\n", "Q: Is there a system keystroke (interrupt) I can press to force a coredump on OSX?

The system information says that the battery is fine and charged, the cable is plugged in but not charging. When I connect the actual charging cable it stays that way and doesn’t charge (I waited and checked for at least 10 mins). The other port works fine though. Crazy thing it doesn’t sound the “charger connected” ding when I plug in the charger. I’m using the original charger.\nI Googled and read about resetting the SMC system which asks to press the special keys and power button for 10 secs. When the MacBook started, it showed the proper icon which was a black filled cell icon. I plugged in the charger into the same port and it starts charging after a few seconds. I removed the charger and it goes back to the same behavior.\nAs for the data transfer connection using the same port, I’m using a hub for that and it wasn’t working either with that port.\nI’m new to Apple Ecosystem and I don’t have an Apple store around here to get it checked by them. So any help would be immensely appreciated because I’m pretty much losing my mind over this investment.\nI also tried enabling and disabling battery health management mode; that didn’t help at all.\nLet me know if anymore information is required to troubleshoot this.\n\nA: Putting an update here so if someone has this problem, they know how I got it resolved.\nSo I talked regarding exchange with Apple Support - no use.

It's working fine at the moment.\n\nA: \nI bought this brand new MacBook Pro few weeks ago, now one of the two Thunderbolt ports are not working.\n\nReturn it. Charging (I’m not referring to “Battery Health Management) is not something that’s regulated by the OS. It’s something that’s handled by the charger and the USB controller that negotiates charging current (you don’t boot the Mac to charge it).  I was recently reading a tech article where one one these controllers can fail for one port will “kill” the charging for all ports (have to find the article).  Could it be this?  Possibility or possibly not. Point is, you have a hardware issue that’s not going to be fixed by OS tweaks, unfortunately.\nGiven that this is brand new and you’re already running into issues, you need to return it. Not for repair, mind you, but for refund/replacement. It’s unacceptable that new products fail this suddenly. Don’t put the burden on your shoulders; put it on Apple’s (my consumer advocacy side coming out).\n", "Q: How to remove leading whitespace in a folder for OneDrive upload on mac os I am currently transitioning my files from local to a OneDrive folder on my mac and after I have copied all of the files in I have hundreds of Sync issues which relate to file names containing spaces at the front.\nI am fairly new to coding / automator and looking around on the internet is fairly daunting!\nIs there an easy way to just select the folder you want and then remove all leading whitespace inside of that folder?

I have a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) running MacOS Catalina 10.15.6. Ever since I updated from MacOS Catalina 10.15.5, when I play music on my MacBook speakers, after a few minutes I'll start hearing a horrible distortion noise along with the music.

In switching from El Capitan, to Catalina, you may have also switched your default shell from bash to zsh, and these shells have different defaults for maintaining their command history. This answer assumes your question is for altering the behavior of the zsh command history.\nYou have at least two choices:\n\n*\n\n*Restore bash as your shell:\n% chsh -s /bin/bash\n\nThis is easily changed if you decide to return to zsh:\nchsh -s /bin/zsh\n\n\n\n*Configure zsh to disable the \"aggregation\" of command histories see APPEND_HISTORY\nFrom man zshoptions:\n\nAPPEND_HISTORY \nIf this is set, zsh sessions will append their history list to  the  history  file,  rather than replace it. Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions\nwill all have the new entries from their history lists added to the  history  file, in the order that they exit.  The file will still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).\n\nAccordingly, if you wish to continue using zsh as your shell, you can un-set the APPEND_HISTORY option, and the command histories from your various terminals/shells will not be aggregated into a single history.\nYou can check to see which options are set or unset as follows:\n% setopt\n...\n# lists options that are set\n\n% unsetopt\n...\n# lists options that are unset\n\n% set -o\n...\n# lists all options w/ off/on status \n\nNOTE: setopt only prints the options not enabled by default. The APPEND_HISTORY option is set by default - as designated by the <D> seen in the man page excerpt above.\nNow, this is a bit obtuse (IMO at least), but notice that there is an option appearing in the unsetopt output named noappendhistory. This is explained in the zsh Options documentation as follows:\n\nIn the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked ; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are marked , , ,  as appropriate. When listing options (by ‘setopt’, ‘unsetopt’, ‘set -o’ or ‘set +o’), those turned on by default appear in the list prefixed with ‘no’. Hence (unless KSH_OPTION_PRINT is set), ‘setopt’ shows all options whose settings are changed from the default.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nIt comes down to this: the option to give you the behavior you want is set as follows:\nsetopt noappendhistory\n\nAdd this command to your ~/.zshrc file using your favorite editor. Once you've done that, source this file as follows:\n% . ~/.zshrc \n-- OR --\n% source ~/.zshrc\n\n\nA: This answer assumes the question concerns the behavior of the command history function in zsh.\nI feel two points should be made before proposing an answer:\n\n*\n\n*Information available online for zsh often refers to a \"default configuration\". As far as macOS is concerned, the zsh \"default configuration\" may differ from that described in other sources. The \"macOS default configuration\" is the zsh \"default configuration\" as modified by /etc/zshrc. It's best to review this file before making changes, AND all changes should be made in the local user's ~/.zshrc file.\n\n*It helps (me at least) to understand that the shell can maintain two (2) command histories. One is a history file (by default: ~/.zsh_history), the other one is a session history that is cached or retained in memory for each session. The parameters SAVEHIST and HISTSIZE determine the depth of the history file, and the session history, respectively. This can be confusing, and the figure below, while not technically accurate, may help in understanding the concept.\n\nFor each session, there is a unique session history. However, there is (by default) only one file history for all sessions. Under the macOS default configuration (ref. /etc/zshrc): HISTSIZE=2000, SAVEHIST=1000. When a new session is started, the session history is empty. However, assuming the file history is not empty, pressing the up arrow key (⬆︎) will reveal commands issued from other sessions. As time goes on - as commands are issued in this new session - its session history will begin filling commands entered in this new session. After, say, 20 commands have been issued, the up arrow (⬆︎) will reveal those 20 commands; the next up arrow key press will reveal the latest entry in the file history.\n\nIn summary: In a new session under the macOS default configuration (HISTSIZE=2000, SAVEHIST=1000) your command history is drawn from the history file, which is to say from the session histories of other sessions. As more commands are issued in this new session, these session commands will \"push\" commands from the history file further down in the stack.\nAs I understand your question, you do not wish your session histories to co-mingle. That is, for any session, you do not want to see any command history from another session - from the history file. After reading the above, if this is the behavior you want, here is one way to do that:\nProposed Answer: Set SAVEHIST=0 and HISTSIZE=2000\nOpen the file ~/.zshrc in your editor, and add the following two lines which override the macOS defaults:\n\nSAVEHIST=0\nHISTSIZE=2000\n\nSAVEHIST=0 will prevent any session from saving its history to the history file. Each session will have a command history consisting only of its unique session history. The up and down arrow keys (⬆︎, ⬇︎) will never show a command from another session because as far as the current session is concerned, that history does not exist. Potentially undesirable side effects of this option are:\n\n*\n\n*new sessions have no command history\n\n\n*if a session is closed or terminates, command history is lost, but see Note 4 below.\nIf you tend to keep sessions open for long periods of time (as I do), you could set HISTSIZE to a larger value to postpone \"pruning\" when the history reaches 120% of its allocation (2,400 commands in this case).\nIf you wish to retain the history file,zsh provides a large number of options for controlling how the history file and session history are maintained, and how they interact with each other to present your command history. In addition the fc commands are shell built-ins that allow manipulation of the  the command history (see also: 1, 2, 3). Beyond the options native to zsh are numerous 3rd party tools dedicated to the command history function - even a tool that stores command history and related tidbits in a relational database. I would summarize by saying, \"The shell command history suffers from an embarrassment of riches.\"\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*Note that the name ~/.zsh_history is not a standard for zsh - it is simply the filename that Apple has chosen.\n\n\n*Apple defines their defaults for zsh in the file /etc/zshrc. It's instructive to review these, but it's probably best to make changes to the defaults within your local configuration file at ~/.zshrc.\n\n\n*HISTFILE, HISTSIZE and SAVEHIST are covered in the zshparam manuals\n\nHISTFILE (from man 1 zshparam)\nThe file to save the history in when  an  interactive  shell exits.

I know creating a temporary file in /tmp/ forces the command line tools update to be displayed, for example.\nI was thinking as well of just downloading the specific update dmg from Apple Downloads.\n\nA: We script softwareupdate  to pick from some or one of the advertised installs but not to pick a “n-1” patch version like you are asking.\nI don’t think you can pull 10.5.5 from the command line now that 10.5.6 is out. Hopefully someone smart and clever can let me know if I’m wrong here.\nI would grab the files from the download link and script them if that’s your main goal. Apple is being asked by the Macintosh admin community to allow a delay so we can pause / delay the latest for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, but that functionality isn’t shipping yet. The command line tools are a special case where you can fake things out as far as I can tell from working with Apple Engineering on this the past year or so (and talking with peers in the macadmin community).\nThe consensus “long term / stable solution” seems to be to get some machines in the beta program / seeding program so you can test these releases before they ship and then hop on updates on your fleet a week to three past when the general availability. Then you can just not update when a new one or blocking one arrives - as opposed to try to pick something that’s not the latest.\nWe like to let machines update as soon as they can and only block a new update due to known issues / inability to have a backup / restore checkpoint if we run into issues. Then once we know we’re good, we push an update to catch up the machines where people don’t self update on day 1 of an update being available.\nDon’t under estimate Apple’s clear goal to get everyone to patch securely and rapidly. User experience is poor when an update breaks things, but also degrades when too many patches are in service and bugs not fixed.\n", "Q: iOS how to read bluetoothd service logs in the console? I’m debugging a Bluetooth app on an iPhone. When I connect it via cable to a Mac, I see that Apple logs output from “bluetoothd” service in between my app’s output.

So that whenever they want to change it, they will need the administrators password?\n\nA: I am adding one more option:\nFrom System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General tab,  click on Advanced... from where you can set up the inactivity timer as you want and enable administrator option. Any other standard user can't access other system-wide preferences setup too. So I guess this option will easier for you.\n\n\nA: You can set MacOS to sleep the display or activate the screensaver after a specified period of time, and require them to type their own password to unlock the screen.\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy's General tab has a control for requiring a password to unlock the display.\nYou can set the time for the display to turn off in Energy Saver preference pane, or the ScreenSaver time can be set in Desktop & Screen Saver.\nTo ensure that users cannot change the settings, then the users would need to be Standard user accounts, not Admin accounts. (Arguably, that should be the case in any managed environment.)\n\nA: \nShould I then prep the MacBook as an administrator and other users as regular user? So that whenever they want to change it, they will need the administrators password?\n\nYes. This is exactly how this feature/function is designed to work.\nWhether you’re setting a time limit for inactivity or regulating the joining of WiFi networks you can restrict how and what a user can modify. Keep in mind, that the “tighter” you lock things down, is the more administrator intervention you’ll experience as they go through their workflow and those settings legitimately need to be tweaked. It’s a balancing act you’ll have to work through.\nAlso, from the other end of the spectrum - making them an admin - the old adage is \"one one admin can do, another can undo\" so use caution when granting admin rights.\n", "Q: Strange behaviour of symlink /var I have a pretty new MacBook and got this from our central IT department pre-installed.\nI experienced a problem, which I first thought was related to Terraform, but after investigation this seems to be a general problem at all.\nHaving a look at simple cat commands:\nls -al /var/tf-test/                                                                 \ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxrwx   3 root     wheel   96  3 Aug 11:00 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  30 root     wheel  960  3 Aug 10:57 ..\n-rwxrwxrwx   1 user     wheel  198  3 Aug 11:00 backend.hcl\n\ncat /var/tf-test/backend.hcl                                                         \nI am fine\n\npwd                                                                                  \n/Users/user/tf-test\n\ncat ../../../var/tf-test/backend.hcl                                                 \ncat: ../../../var/tf-test/backend.hcl: No such file or directory\n\nThis is pretty strange ....since cat should resolve the symlink und should automatically point to the real path, right?\nThis basically leads to my Terraform to not deploy anything, since Terraform is generating a relative path from the current directory to a backend-config (a parameter) and then couldn't resolve it:\npwd                                                                                  \n/Users/user/tf-test\n\nterraform init -backend-config /var/tf-test/backend.hcl                          \nInitializing the backend...\nError: Failed to read file\nThe file \"../../../var/tf-test/backend.hcl\" could not be read.\n\nPermissions seems to be ok, isn't it?\nls -la /\ndrwxr-xr-x    6 root  wheel    192 28 Mai 01:32 private\nlrwxr-xr-x@   1 root  admin     11 13 Jul 13:05 tmp -> private/tmp\nlrwxr-xr-x@   1 root  admin     11 13 Jul 13:05 var -> private/var\n\nGuys, this freaks me out.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: I would probably start with two things.\n\n*\n\n*sudo -s\n\n*Judicious use of file hopefully can help pick apart the error in thinking, permissions or execution here.\n\nFile should report correct results all the way back to root, and then all the way back to /private/var - once you’ve got a string of good results - repeat the sequence of file checks to test ../../var/whatever\n# file ../../var/                                      \n../../var/: directory\n# file ../../var/com.twocanoes.tcscryptotoken.tcstoken/        \n../../var/com.twocanoes.tcscryptotoken.tcstoken/: directory\n# file ../../var/com.twocanoes.tcscryptotoken.tcstoken/token.sh \n../../var/com.twocanoes.tcscryptotoken.tcstoken/token.sh: POSIX shell script text executable, ASCII text\n\nIf you are on Catalina - realize you are crossing filesystem boundaries and firmlinks are in play as well as sym links.

I am using a 2011 MacBook Pro 15\", this is the model with the AMD GPU problems and I have used the NVRAM modification to disable the AMD GPU and then Dosdude's patch to install Catalina.\nThis is a usable laptop with an i7 and 16GB of RAM so it runs Catalina fine.

I ordered the iPhone 7 off of Amazon. I got the phone yesterday and when I finished setting up my Apple ID, I tried to download an app. It immediately said my ID was not in use at the U.S. store and that I needed to review the account, it also said my Apple ID was not in use in the iTunes Store but my iTunes isn’t working. So I went back to my account and it took me to a page where I had to agree to Terms and Service. Above it was a location and it said I was from Albania. I changed it to United States and refilled all my information, then I tried to download an app and it said the same thing. I went to settings and changed my location on there, but it’s not helping to reset the App Store and iTunes. Not sure what I’m doing wrong. I’ve contacted Apple Support and I stayed up until midnight trying to figure it out. We factory reset it so many times and we tried turning my phone off and on again. I’ve tried going to the Apple ID website and changing my location from there but it keeps resetting to Albania as well. I have no idea what’s wrong with it.\n\nA: There are two possibilities. One common and the other rare.\nThe common item is your AppleID is steering this. You can solve that with Apple Support directly and I would leave your device out of the picture - just use a computer to go to https://appleid.apple.com and choose your region / locale / banking so that your preferred location pops up when you browse https://www.apple.com and https://support.apple.com\nThe less common item is that Apple tracks the geography in to which an iPhone is sold. This can not be changed unless you have documented proof as the original purchaser that Apple made a mistake. If a reseller makes a mistake, it’s generally up to them to fix the registration.\nThis affects things like GPS being disabled, functions like EKG / health / watch being enabled only in regions where it’s officially approved (legally and contractually) by regulatory  agencies (the FDA in the US for example).\nOnce the AppleID is set, I would erase all content and settings on the iPhone and perform a setup again, and then engage Apple Support if you are not being offered your preferred region. Sometimes a reseller uses an iPhone to set up a bunch of accounts and then sells it, so you might need to talk to your seller if for some reason your phone isn’t working as Apple designed it out of the box.\nAsk a pointed question to your buyer - which region did Apple sell this iPhone if you can’t solve this yourself. Tracing back to the contact to which Apple shipped the device (you or a reseller) will make it easy to know if a mistake was made.\n", "Q: Set print quality to ‘Best’ by default When printing in macOS, I can set the print quality in the Media & Quality section:\n\nIs it possible to set the quality setting to ‘Best’ by default?

I'm used to have some keyboard shortcut remapping for menu items via Apple's system preferences -> keyboard pane.

What's the correct way nowadays to do it?\n\nA: Figured it out. You have to add the application you want to modify keys for to com.apple.universalaccess.\ndefaults write com.apple.universalaccess com.apple.custommenu.apps -array-add \"com.googlecode.iterm2\"\n\nor if all keyboard equivalents are set via one file, you can also write the full list at once\ndefaults write com.apple.universalaccess com.apple.custommenu.apps -array \"com.googlecode.iterm2\" \"com.apple.Safari\" \"com.google.Chrome\"\n\nThe other thing that was tricky was, that my iterm2 prefs file is symlinked and therefore doesn't appear in the list of domains nor is read with the defaults tool.

Trying to work around the system's blocking your attempts to rm by going into recovery mode is a sign you are taking a hammer to the problem and is not generally a good approach. Before doing that I would try the following.\nAfter your initial command to identify what backups there are:\n% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /                \nSnapshots for volume group containing disk /:\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-08-03-161551.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-08-03-162946.local\n\nYou can then delete any of them with a command like:\n% tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2020-08-03-161551\n\nEach may take a while to delete, so if you have a lot and want to automate the process, you can use this command to extract the relevant part of each file name (matching on the current year, if it's an old one you may want to ):\n% tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates / | cut -f2 -d. | while read f; do tmutil deletelocalsnapshots $f; done\n\nBut I'm always paranoid about automating destructive commands, so you should first test that command with this safe variation (to protect you from something like a file naming convention change that makes the cut command act unexpectedly):\n% tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates / | cut -f2 -d. | while read f; do echo $f; done\n\n\nA: It is not possible to delete those orphaned Time Machine snapshots from the regular user space.

Up to and including Mojave, /var/log was listed in the sidebar of Console.app, allowing me to browse subfolders and, for instance, look at /var/log/powermanagement logs for previous days.\nBut in Catalina, there are no directories listed in the Console sidebar.  Is there some way to browse these folders using Console in Catalina?\n(I tried adding them by finding the folders in Finder and then dragging them to the sidebar like one would with the Finder sidebar, but to no avail.)\n\nA: In Catalina the interface for Console got a revamp, in my opinion not for the better.\nIf you click on \"Log Reports\" in the left hand bar you will get a list of the logs in /var/log.

Do screen manufacturers such as Dell or LG have any agreement with Apple?\nTechnically, we're plugging in a non-standard power adapter; can it void the warranty?\nEdit: By \"non-standard\" I meant \"non-Apple\".\n\nA: Safety and reliability\nIn this context, \"safety\" refers to a products ability to function as advertised with no adverse affects to it nor the device in which it interfaces.\n\nIs it safe to connect external screen to the MacBook via USB-C from the warranty perspective?\n\nWhy wouldn't it be safe?\nThe idea behind standardizing on USB is so that you can plug in 3rd party devices to expand and enhance the functionality of your computer.  If plugging in devices voided your warranty, they wouldn't put the port there and instead we'd still have (our cherished) MagSafe power connectors.\nIf it wasn't safe to do something, the manufacturer wouldn't market that function as a feature of the product.\n\nPower Delivery\n\nSince power is supplied to MacBook there is a (small) risk to damage the laptop.\n\nTechnically speaking, anything you plug into your laptop has the potential of damaging it.\nSince USB 1.0, power has always been supplied - 5V @ 500mA.  It is only since the USB Power Delivery Specification was implemented that more power can be delivered; up to 100W or 20V @ 5A.\nThis is why you should always stick to known brands and avoid the cheap knockoffs.1  It's a timeless adage -  you get what you pay for -  but it still holds true today.  That said, it still doesn't rule out the possibility of a manufacturer defects.  While very rare, they do happen; your expensive Dell or LG could potentially damage your MacBook.\n\n\nTechnically, we're plugging in a non-standard power adapter; can it void the warranty?\n\nIf you are plugging in a display that provides power  and conforms to the USB PD specification, especially if it's USB-IF certified  it's not \"non-standard.\"  That device is designed to connect, interface with, negotiate, and accept power.  You plugging in this device, does not void your warranty.\nApple decided to go from a (beloved) proprietary power connector - the MagSafe - to a widely adopted industry standard connector that literally has \"universal\" in the name: USB-C.  Simply using a different charger doesn't void your warranty.  If damages arise because it was defective, that's a different story.\nIs the Macbook 12 inch's USB-C charger interchangeable with other USB-C chargers or devices?\nFrom a pragmatic point of view using your Dell or LG monitors as the basis of your postulate, how can you possibly have a \"genuine Apple\" charger coming out of a third party monitor?  This would mean that the moment you connect a non-Apple monitor you void the warranty.   Until recently, Apple had exited the display business when they ceased production of the Thunderbolt Display in June of 2016.3  The display provided charging via a MagSafe connector; the Thunderbolt port didn't supply power. Therefore, it would be virtually impossible to \"officially\" charge a later model MacBook with this display.\n\nWarranties\n\nDo screen manufacturers such as Dell or LG have any agreement with Apple?\n\nSpeaking as someone who worked in product management for a hardware manufacturer (in a past life), there are no agreements between companies that spell out any sort of liability assignment or otherwise with respect to each other's hardware.  From a practicality standpoint, this would be absurd - think about how many display vendors there are.  That alone would be next to impossible to manage.  Now, expand that to all the different USB devices and accessories.  There's no way to manage warranty reciprocity agreements to that scale thus making it totally unfeasible.\nFrom the perspective of the manufacturer, the warranty generally covers the products fitness or in other words, it's ability to do what it says it will do.  If you read the fine print, there will always be a clause exempting coverage for misuse/abuse.\nFrom Apple's own warranty language, they basically say this:\n\nThis Warranty does not apply to any non-Apple branded hardware products or any software, even if packaged or sold with Apple hardware. Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers, other than Apple, may provide their own warranties to you – please contact them for further information. 2\n\nWhat Voids Your Warranty\nIn short, misuse, abuse, and anything that's covered in the warranty language.  Ultimately, it comes down to what you can prove.  Here's a short excerpt from the hardware warranty; I encourage you to review the whole section at the link provided.\n\nSoftware distributed by Apple with or without the Apple brand (including, but not limited to system software) is not covered by this Warranty. ... Apple does not warrant that the operation of the Apple Product will be uninterrupted or error-free. Apple is not responsible for damage arising from failure to follow instructions relating to the Apple Product’s use. 2\n\nCan Apple Void Your Warranty Solely for Using a Third Party Accessory?\nNo.  The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act4 (in the US, your country's laws may differ) gives protection to consumers in that installation or use of third party accessories cannot void the warranty unless they it can be proven that the part or accessory in question is the reason for the failure.\nThe FTC (Federal Trade Commission) specifically addresses this in warning letters sent to several companies5:\n\n...companies can’t void a consumer’s warranty or deny warranty coverage solely because the consumer uses a part made by someone else or gets someone not authorized by the company to perform service on the product.\n\n(Hover for  Opinion)\n\n This means that warranty void stickers6 and using your Dell monitor that conveniently supplies power to your MacBook Pro for charging cannot void your warranty.

When warranty ends, the responsibility to pay shifts to the consumer.\n\n*Consider if any accessory you plug in to the Mac is less well engineered than Apple and then if the chance of resulting damage should be covered by Apple. This is just the technical analysis.\n\n*It's almost certain the Warranty excludes any damage arising from using non-Apple parts, but the letter of the warranty and consumer law globally may affect this.\n\n*If your Mac fails, it likely won't be due to a display charging it - on a technical level.\n\nThat being said, Dell and LG certainly have engineers that can work closely with Apple on standards bodies and they are likely among the best in terms of displays, power supplies - so the chance of being left in the cold by mixing these specific items is very low - you are likely safe, despite Apple not being on the hook to pay for repair if your Mac fails due to a display.\n", "Q: How to modify the command line text showing in Mac terminal My Macbook Pro shows a wired string (\"ryoitasuou\") at terminal like below picture.\nDoes any know how to remove or modify it ?\nI already deleted the \"ryoitasuou\" folder in /Users folder , and modify username in \"bash_profile\" , but these steps does not help.\np.s.

Often when I am using my iPhone I find that I am using mobile data without realising it. If I am engrossed in an activity, it seems unlikely that I would look up to check whether I am using 4G. So is there a way of getting a notification when, unbeknownst to me, I start using 4G rather than Wi-Fi.\nI’m not against using 4G; I’d just like to know when this is happening.\nCan I enable this directly or with a third party app?\n\nA: There's no way in iOS that would send a notification if you start using mobile data rather than Wi-Fi.\nHowever, you can either disable mobile-data entirely; disable Wi-Fi assist, which is a feature baked into iOS that lets the phone switch automatically to mobile data if the Wi-Fi signal is weak; or disable mobile data on a per app basis.\nIf you are concerned about a data hungry app such as video streaming or social networking apps, you can selectively disable mobile data for them by going to Settings app → Mobile Data and turn off the switch shown corresponding to the desired apps.\n", "Q: Cannot partition external drive I  have an external drive that I just cannot partition.

This points to a failing drive.\nfsck is a utility to fix A corrupted file system and will not have sny effect here.  Looking at it from a simplified perspective, in order for fsck to work, you have to have an existing filesystem in place for it to fix.  formatting a disk is the act of wiping away whatever was there in order to install a new filesystem.  It’s like bulldozing your property to build a house. In this case, the guy doing it reported a problem that prevents you from doing it (they found a fault line).  Running fsck at this point would be like calling the plumber to come fix the pipes because you can’t clear away your property.\n\n*\n\n*External Hard Drive no longer working\nBasically, you need to replace that drive.\nFrom your further attempts:\n\nThen I had no issues creating multiple partitions under MBR, but any attempt to go back to GPT led to the message above re backup table and failure to create multiple partitions under GPT.\n\nThis further lends credibility to the diagnosis that your drive is failing. Where the tables are stored is in different places on the drive; the “whole” drive doesn’t have to be completely inaccessible for the drive to be considered bad.\nI’ve seen this many times: folks will spend countless hours trying to get a drive to format that keeps generating errors. Then, they’re successful once, get it formatted, copy data over, do work, then suffer a catastrophic failure because the drive was dead (dying) to begin with.\nFormatting a drive is a super easy task. If it takes you multiple utilities and days of effort, something is very wrong.  Don’t risk your data; get a new drive.\n", "Q: Chrome popup on random urls?

I'm using the instructions from this question: How do I add my Applications folder to the dock?\n\nIn Finder, right-click on Applications on the Sidebar and select: Add to Dock\n\nto add Applications to my Dock, however, nothing happens when I click \"Add to Dock\".  I've also tried dragging Applications from finder onto the Dock next to Trash, but nothing happens.  How can I find out what's wrong?\nI'm on Catalina, 10.15.6 19G73\n\nA: When you \"right-click on Applications on the Sidebar and select: Add to Dock\", nothing obvious happens if you have the Dock hidden, which is the default behavior. If your Dock looks anything like mine, after you add the Applications folder to the Dock, you might not even notice it.\nWhen I right-click on Applications on the Sidebar and select: Add to Dock on Catalina 10.15.6, and then mouse down to the bottom of the screen to reveal the Dock, the Dock now has what looks like a new Application Icon next to the Trash Basket. It does not look like a folder at all. Instead, it is a stack of icons, with the top-most being the first (alphabetically) application in the Applications folder, so at first glance it looks like just another Application on the Dock.\nWhen I hover over it, a label \"Applications\" pops up over it and when I click on it, it expands into a grid of icons representing all the Applications in the Applications folder. So that is the Applications folder in the Dock.\nIf I then drag the Applications folder from the Finder to the Dock, it disappears when I release the mouse, because the Applications folder is already in the Dock and you cannot have it duplicated in the Dock.\n\nA: Assuming you are not dragging the folder to a section of the dock on the right instead of the left sides that are generated by rule instead of by preference - consider deleting all dock settings after taking a screenshot of how you like it now.\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal app (or other shell)\n\n*defaults delete com.apple.dock\n\n*Log out from the Apple Menu\n\nWhen you log back in, set up the dock as you please.\n", "Q: Applescript to find and add specific contacts to a group I tried to re-jig the applescript from these two answers, but no dice.

I am having a problem merging two Pages documents into one. I have several Pages files that I'd like to merge into a single document. These Pages files have a lot of graphics and spreadsheet tables. When I try to copy file #2 and paste it at the end of file #1, all of the spreadsheet tables and some of the other graphics get left behind or moved around.  Is there another way to merge 2 or more Pages files into one single Pages file. I can't convert them into PDFs because the final document must be in Pages. I have tried copying and pasting the Thumbnails but the graphics still get messed up. Does anyone know how to do this?\n\nA: I am on Pages 10.1 and no longer have access to anything that still has v8.1.  This means the precise instructions might be a little different, but Pages 8.1 does support these features (even if the menus or wording might be a little different).\nPages has a two major modes of operation.\n\n*\n\n*Word Processing mode:  This is the default mode for most documents.  In this mode, document text is added directly to the page. If you reach the end of a page but continue typing, a new pages is added and you continue to type on the new page.  If you delete some of the text from the first page, all text is moved up (including text from adjacent pages).\n\n*Page Layout mode:  This mode works like a publishing system and is easier to use if you are creating newspapers, newsletters, or magazine style documents... where you have multiple articles and an article might start on one page, but finish on a later page -- even with other articles interspersed between them.  In this mode, you don't type directly onto a page.  Instead you create a text frame and place it on the page and type only within the frame.  If you run out of space, the frame will not automatically grow nor will new pages automatically get created.  You manually added pages as needed and add more text frames as needed... but you link text frames together if they all belong to the same article in the publication.  When a text frame is full, text automatically flows into and continues in the next text frame (provided you linked it to the same article).\n\nYou do a little more setup to use Page Layout mode because you have to manually create and size your text frames where you want them ... but the advantage is that things go exactly where you want them.\nAlso, in Page Layout mode, each page is a discrete thing.  If you move a page, the whole page and everything on it moves along with it and everything is exactly as you placed.  This is true wether you are moving it to a new location within the same document, or copying it to a completely different document (assuming the destination document is also using Page Layout mode.)\nConvert to Page Layout Mode\nBefore you do this, beware the danger... in Page Layout mode, you cannot apply text directly onto a page.  E.g. if you create a new blank document, switch it to Page Layout mode, and then try to type... you'll notice it won't let you.  You must drop a text box onto the page and then you can type inside the text box.  It's probably worth doing some experiments with this to understand how it works before attempting to convert a document you care about (make a backup before you make any changes).\nWhen you ultimately do perform a conversion from Word Processing mode to Page Layout mode, any text you had typed directly onto a page will disappear.  It will not automatically create text boxes for you and move your text into those boxes.  This is something you have to do manually.\nThere are two ways to perform the conversion (but I'm using Pages 10.1 and cannot promise this looked the same in Pages 8.1):\nUsing the 'File' Menu to Convert\nNavigate to the 'File' menu and you should notice a menu choice that will either say \"Convert to Page Layout\" or \"Convert to Word Processing\".  If you see \"Convert to Page Layout\" it means you are currently in Word Processing mode.  If you see \"Convert to Word Processing\" it means you are in Page Layout mode.\nUsing the Document Inspector Panel\nThe other method is to use the Document inspector.  I've added an image for clarity.\n\nTo use this method,\n\n*\n\n*Select the 'Document' inspector panel icon on the tool-bar.\n\n*Select the 'Document' tab within the Document inspector panel.\n\n*Check to see if 'Document Body' is enabled.\n\nIf Document Body is enabled, you are in Word Processing mode (and can type directly on the page).  If Document Body is not enabled, you are in Page Layout mode and can only type text within a text-frame.\nIf you attempt to change the mode you will be asked to confirm that you really want to change.  Remember... any text that was directly on a page (not within a text frame) will be lost.  Make sure you manually copy this text, create text boxes, and then paste your text into the text box(es).\nLinking Text Boxes\nWhen you create a new text box, if you select the box you'll notice the control points located not the sides and corners, and a round empty circle in the top-center of the box.  Click that circle and it will turn into a number '1' and get a color assignment.  This means it is the 1st text box associated with your thread (a thread represents an article).\nCreate a new text box and repeat by clicking the circle.  It will automatically fill in with a '2' (indicating it is the 2nd text frame in the thread.)  But notice if you hover-over the '2', a tiny arrow appears.   This means this text box is now \"linked\" to the first text box.  As you type and fill the box, text will autoflow into the next box that is linked to the same thread.  If you click on the colored number in the top-center of any text box you get a sub-menu and can choose to link that box to a different thread/article or create a new thread, or just unlink the box (remove from thread).\nCopy & Paste\nIn Page Layout mode (and only in Page Layout mode) you can move entire pages \"as is\" -- the page will look exactly the same in the new destination.  You cannot do this in Word Processing mode.\n\n*\n\n*Select \"View\" -> \"Page Thumbnails\"\n\n*Select the individual page or pages that you want to copy (it is only possible to select individual pages if you are in Page Layout mode).\n\n*Select \"Edit\" -> \"Copy\"\n\n*In the destination document, select \"Edit\" -> \"Paste\"\n\nThe pages will come across as they were.  This is because in this mode, pages simply hold \"objects\" -- objects are things like text boxes, images, charts or graphs, etc. etc.  Each page knows which objects are located on that page and the relative positioning or layout of each object.  Hence the name \"Page Layout\" mode.\nNuances of Either Mode\nYou can insert objects inline within text in either mode.  E.g. insert a picture in the middle of an article in Word Processing mode or in Page Layout mode and that image placement is relative to the point in your article ... not to a spot on the page.  In other words, add or delete some text in the article located above the image and you'll see the image moves up or down.\nBut you can also create an object on a page (such as an image) where it's location is pinned to the page itself and not tied to a location within an article (it wont move as you edit the article... the article will move and flow around the other object -- depending on the rules you set.\nIf you copy a range of an text in an article and that range includes an \"inline\" image, the image will get copied along with the text.  If you copy a range of text where the image is it's own object (not inline), then you'll only get the text and the other objects are left behind.  You have to manually copy those separate objects in a separate operation.\n", "Q: Mac mini with an iPad as the only display? Can I run a Mac mini with an iPad as the only display?\nLet's say that Sidecar has some kind of an autostart and when the Mac mini boots, it automatically gets started.\n\nA: Sidecar lets you use an iPad as a secondary display for your Mac. So Sidecar doesn't have any such kind of mode that lets you use an iPad as the only display.\nYou can, however, explore some 3rd party solutions which claim to make your iPad usable as a standalone display for a Mac mini. A such prominent 3rd party solution is Luna Display, Headless Mode\n\n*\n\n*https://shop.astropad.com/pages/headless-mode\n\nWith Luna Display, turn your iPad into the primary display for Mac mini. Combine the best of Mac mini and iPad by harnessing the processing power of the Mac mini and the edge-to-edge full display of the iPad.\nMinimum Requirements\n\n*\n\n*Mac mini must be a 2011 model or later, and running macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or later\n\n*iPad must be an iPad 2, iPad Mini, iPad Pro, or iPad Air model running iOS 9.1 or later (32-bit devices are not supported)\nExternal mouse and keyboard connected to Mac mini are optimal for this setup in case of MacOS permissions and logins\n\nHow to Get Started\n\n*\n\n*An external display is required to get set up, but is only needed the first time you configure your devices (unless FileVault is enabled).\n\n*Luna Display requires a Mac application to run. For Headless Mode, if FileVault is in use, an external display will be needed to unlock your drive whenever you reboot.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.astropad.com/article/218-how-do-i-use-luna-display-in-headless-mode\n\n\nHeadless Mode: Using your iPad as the display for Mac mini\nWhat you will need to get started:\n\n*\n\n*Mac Mini\n\n\n*iPad\n\n\n*Luna Display and latest versions of the Luna Display apps, available for download at lunadisplay.com/hello\nReliable local WiFi network connection or USB cable\nWe recommend connecting an external keyboard to your Mac mini.\n\n\nP.S.: No affiliation whatsoever with Luna Display or any subsidiaries.

I used the command sudo visudo and added this line to it:\n<my_username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: <path/to/command --arguments>\n\nBut whenever I update macOS, my sudoers file is reset to its defaults. A folder named Relocated Items appears on my Desktop and it always includes the following file: /Users/Shared/Relocated Items/Configuration/private/etc/sudoers. This happens on macOS Catalina, and also on macOS Big Sur.\n\nHow can I prevent the sudoers file resetting to its defaults with every macOS update?\n\nA: Modifying most of the files in /etc leaves you open to them being replaced during OS updates. That's why most of the ones you usually need to change have the facility to add files to a directory instead.\nIf you look in /etc you will see a directory called sudoers.d and the last line of the sudoers file is #includedir /private/etc/sudoers.d so any file of commands you put into the directory will be read. Files in the directory will not be overwritten when you update.\nYou may notice directories with similar names in /etc that fill the same function for other parts of the system.\n", "Q: How can I update my macOS 10.14.6 to latest version?

What should I do?\n\nA: macOS 10.15 is macOS Catalina. The former is the major version number for macOS, while the latter is the marketing name. Both are essentially the same operating system.\nSo, you do not need macOS 10.15 to install macOS Catalina. You can go to Mac App Store and search for macOS Catalina, or use the following link to access the macOS Catalina page on the Mac App Store:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/macos-catalina/id1466841314\nOnce you have the page open, click on the GET or the  button to download the macOS Catalina installer.\nOnce downloaded, the installer would launch automatically and guide you through the installation of macOS Catalina 10.15.\nUsing the Mac App Store would also let you automatically get the current latest update of macOS Catalina, which is macOS Catalina 10.15.6 (6th point release of macOS Catalina).\nShould you encounter any issue with installation, make sure you are logged in with an account with administrative access.\nAlso, make sure you have a backup of your critical data for a very less likely case where the installation may fail.\n\nA: You have three options:\n\n*\n\n*Use Recovery.

I plug in the charger when using it.\nBut my MacBook shows Not Charging in the battery icon in the macOS task bar. But I have the charging cable plugged in.\nWhy does it show that? It appears my MacBook is fine, but I don't know why it shows me Not Charging.\n\nA: The Not Charging message that you see is most likely displayed by the Battery health management feature build into macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and later, and is available on MacBooks with Thunderbolt 3 port.\nThe Battery health management features is intended to slow down the chemical ageing of MacBook battery by analyzing the battery temperature history and charging patterns, and intermittently stopping the charging.\nYou can toggle the Battery health management feature by going to System Preferenes app → Energy, and clicking on the Battery Health... button and unchecking Battery health management.\n\nApple recommends you leave it turned on, but lets you turn off the setting.\nYou can learn more about Battery health management by reading the following Apple Support document:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211246\n", "Q: Charging 7th generation iPad using MacBook Pro 61W USB-C Power adapter When I'm not at home, I'm used to charge both my MacBook Pro (2017) and my iPhone 8 with the MacBook charger for convenience.

It would be safe to use your MacBook Pro 61W power adapter to charge your iPad.\nIt is your device that actually determines the power it receives, not the charger.\nHowever, the Apple Support document on Fast charging doesn't mention 7th generation iPad.

I've tried going to display and changing the volume but the slider does not work (it is fixed at the top).\nThe monitor is a Dell HDMI monitor. The sound is unusable like this. What can I do?\n\nA: You can use a 3rd party utility called SoundSource which lets you control the volume of the external display connected to your Mac using the Macs built-in volume controls.\nSoundSource is a macOS app from Rogue Amoeba, a well known and reputed developer of audio utilities for macOS.\nWhile SoundSource is a paid app, Rogue Amoeba provides a fully functional but time-limited demo of the app which you can try to see if that resolves your issue.\n\nP.S.: No affiliation whatsoever with Rogue Amoeba or any affiliates.

I would like to have darker colors, but it seems like I can only pick one color at a time)\n\n*Changing grid size (I would like to make the grid a bit smaller, so it fits my handwriting better)\n\n*Option for pages (Ideally I would like to be able to print my notes, but the $\\infty$-paper cuts my handwriting in half)\n\nOther features (like pdf annotation, text recognition etc.) are not important for my use case. The recommended apps I was able to test (Notes, INKredible, Nebo, Sketches, Paper, Quicknotes) didn’t fulfill these requirements. Due to cost I could not test Goodnotes or Notepad+.\nI hope there is an app satisfying my needs, to specially to vouch for a paid app if that’s the only fit for my requirements.\nCan any app do some or all of my requirements?\n\nA: Notability is the app you want to use but it is $8.99. There is also a version for Macs as well. This allows multiple colors and it opens with a large page to write on. I can't vouch for it because I use Notes but Notability is a popular app. You can read about it at the link I included.\nThere is a free app called Notes Writer which you could check out since it's free.\n", "Q: How can I script the bootup disk in macOS Catalina without disabling SIP? I'm on Catalina 10.15.6.\nPreviously, you could write shell scripts that would set the boot volume and restart the Mac, either by using bless --mount X --setBoot or by using systemsetup -setstartupdisk, but neither of these commands seem to work now when System Integrity Protection is enabled.\nThere must be some way to automate this, since the System Preferences app is able to change your boot disk without SIP being disabled, you just need to provide an admin password. What mechanism does the pref pane use to set the bootup disk now? Can we invoke it in a shell script?\n\nA: The System Preferences app is able to change the startup disk because the application is signed with special, Apple-only entitlements that allow it to bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP). In order to grant those entitlements to your own application, you would need to disable AMFI, which would in turn require you to (wait for it...) disable SIP!\nMany Apple apps contain these types of entitlements. Think about it—if all Apple software was confined by SIP, how could you install updates which modify system files?\nThis also points to a possible workaround. Because System Preferences is allowed to change the startup disk (bypassing a part of SIP), you could write a script which tells System Preferences to do everything for you. I've done this—many years ago, I wrote and used the below Applescript to quickly reboot into Bootcamp. Because it uses UI scripting, it may need tweaking to work on the latest versions of macOS, but it should function as a starting point.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\"\n            set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.startupdisk\"\n            activate\n        end tell\n        tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n            delay 0.3\n            tell window \"Startup Disk\"\n                set lockFound to false\n                repeat with x from 1 to number of buttons\n                    if lockFound is false then\n                        if title of button x is \"Click the lock to make changes.\" then\n                            click button x\n                            set lockFound to true\n                            repeat while title of button x is \"Authenticating...\"\n                                delay 1\n                            end repeat\n                        else if title of button x is \"Click the lock to prevent further changes.\" then\n                            set lockFound to true\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n                click radio button \"BOOTCAMP\" of radio group 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of splitter group 1\n                delay 0.4\n                click button \"Restart…\"\n                delay 0.3\n                click button \"Restart\" of sheet 1\n                return true\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    on error\n        delay 0.5\n        tell application \"System Preferences\"\n            if current pane is pane id \"com.apple.preference.startupdisk\" then quit\n        end tell\n        return false\n    end try\nend tell\n\n\nA: The designers macOS pick which commands that are constrained by SIP. To be more precise, certain commands are given the ability to bypass the constrains of SIP. The bless command is not one of the commands that is contained by SIP. To use the command to set the default to boot would require disabling at least part of SIP.\nAn alternative would be to use a boot manager which can be configured from a macOS script or application. An example of such a boot manager is rEFInd. If installed in a EFI partition, then a password would be required to first mount the partition. If installed to a FAT of ExFAT partition then no password would be required, but would be less secure. The default_selection token can be use to choose the default operating system to boot. Typically, this token and parameters are stored in a file of your choosing. The name of this file is then given as the parameter to the include token stored in the refind.conf file.\n\nA: The SIP was the first problem I've encountered on Big Sur. Turned it off looks like a bad idea. So I tried something like @Wowfunhappy suggested but with update to fit new OS ui and also add some additional functional. The second problem was target volumes list items doesn't have actions. Which make impossible to click on them via click or \"click at\" functions perhaps because of some new additional protections on Big Sur. Click with AST and other scripts also doesn't works due to new MacOS restrictions. The only way I found is using python click(but this leads to a slight delay while script selects target volume).\nSo here is a fully automated switching:\nproperty targetVolume : \"BOOTCAMP\" # find name of required volume inside System Preference > Startup Disk\nproperty passwordValue : \"yourSystemPassword\" # Can be empty\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application \"System Preferences\"\n        set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.startupdisk\"\n        activate\n    end tell\n    tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n        tell window \"Startup Disk\"\n            set volumePosition to {0, 0}\n            set lockFound to false\n            \n            # Check if auth required\n            set authButtonText to \"Click the lock to make changes.\"\n            if exists button authButtonText then\n                click button authButtonText\n                \n                # Wait for auth modal\n                set unlockButtonText to \"Unlock\"\n                repeat\n                    if (exists sheet 1) and (exists button unlockButtonText of sheet 1) then exit repeat\n                end repeat\n                \n                # Autofill password if setted\n                if passwordValue is not equal to \"\" then\n                    set value of text field 1 of sheet 1 to passwordValue\n                    click button unlockButtonText of sheet 1\n                end if\n                \n                # Wait for auth success\n                repeat\n                    if exists button \"Click the lock to prevent further changes.\" then exit repeat\n                end repeat\n            end if\n            \n            # Wait until loading volumes list\n            repeat\n                if exists group 1 of list 1 of scroll area 1 then exit repeat\n            end repeat\n            \n            # Click on target volume (posible a slight delay because of shell script executing)\n            repeat with m in (UI element of list 1 of scroll area 1)\n                if (value of first static text of m = targetVolume) then\n                    tell static text targetVolume of m\n                        set volumePosition to position\n                    end tell\n                end if\n            end repeat\n            set volumePositionX to item 1 of volumePosition\n            set volumePositionY to item 2 of volumePosition\n            my customClick(volumePositionX, volumePositionY)\n            \n            click button \"Restart…\"\n            \n            # Wait for restart modal appears\n            repeat\n                if (exists sheet 1) and (exists value of first static text of sheet 1) then exit repeat\n            end repeat\n            \n            click button \"Restart\" of sheet 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n# shell script to make click work on target volume\non customClick(x, y)\n    do shell script \" \n\n/usr/bin/python <<END\n\nimport sys\n\nimport time\n\nfrom Quartz.CoreGraphics import * \n\ndef mouseEvent(type, posx, posy):\n\n          theEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent(None, type, (posx,posy), kCGMouseButtonLeft)\n\n          CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, theEvent)\n\ndef mousemove(posx,posy):\n\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventMouseMoved, posx,posy);\n\ndef mouseclick(posx,posy):\n\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseDown, posx,posy);\n\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseUp, posx,posy);\n\nourEvent = CGEventCreate(None); \n\ncurrentpos=CGEventGetLocation(ourEvent);             # Save current mouse position\n\nmouseclick(\" & x & \",\" & y & \");\n\nmousemove(int(currentpos.x),int(currentpos.y));      # Restore mouse position\n\nEND\"\nend customClick\n\non simpleEncryption(_str)\n    set x to id of _str\n    repeat with c in x\n        set contents of c to c + 100\n    end repeat\n    return string id x\nend simpleEncryption\n\non simpleDecryption(_str)\n    set x to id of _str\n    repeat with c in x\n        set contents of c to c - 100\n    end repeat\n    return string id x\nend simpleDecryption\n\nYou just need to change two properties targetVolume and passwordValue.

You can do the same process for all systems you have, for example Big Sur 1, Big Sur 2, Bootcamp.\n", "Q: How do I set the on-screen zoom level in OS X TextEdit? I want to set the zoom level in TextEdit to a precise value so that the on-screen display has the same size as the printout.

I have a couple of old Time Machine backups (for computer A and B) that are stored unencrypted on an unencrypted drive. I would like to encrypt them for archival purposes but they need to remain working with TM (e.g. browse using the TM interface, restorable to a new computer using TM and so on).\nI followed the instructions at https://www.howtogeek.com/305540/how-to-encrypt-your-macs-time-machine-backup/ but since A and B are long gone I used computer C. That didn't work out very well, at the final step, instead of starting to encrypt I got this message:\n\nHow can I encrypt an old TM backup when I no longer have access to the machine that was the source for that backup?\n\nA: Warning: I haven't tested this procedure, and there's at least one report of this converting the volume to APFS, which might cause trouble. So I can't really recommend this, I'm just posting it for the record.\nAn encrypted Time Machine backup is just a regular Time Machine backup stored on an encrypted volume (or an encrypted disk image, if it's on a network server -- not relevant here). Therefore, you can convert an unencrypted TM backup to encrypted just by encrypting the volume it's stored on. For some reason, this option isn't available in Disk Utility, but you can do it in the Finder by right-clicking (or Control-clicking) on the volume, and choosing 'Encrypt \"volume name\"'. You'll need to enter an encryption password (be sure not to lose this!), and then leave the disk attached for possibly quite a while as it converts the entire thing to encrypted format.\nNote that @Allan's comments about TM not really being suitable for archiving still apply, whether the backup is encrypted or not.\n\nA: A couple things...\n\n*\n\n*You can’t retroactively encrypt a Time Machine backup especially without the source available\n\n*Time Machine is not designed to be an archival system\n\nTime Machine is a back up tool meaning it examines a filesystem on a a computer and makes copies of files based on certain criteria.  In this case, it copies over only files that have changed since the last back up.  Additionally, it will back up system configuration files specific to your system.  Without the source, Time Machine simply can’t function\nAs for archiving, you save data, not computer settings.  The plist for your program (say Microsoft Word, for example) is useless in the future.  Even the software that gets backed up will be OS and system specific.  There are apps that worked fine just one or two versions of macOS ago, but now with Catalina, they don’t work.  Without the correct system (hardware and and OS) these settings can’t do you any good.\nGoing forward, what you can do to archive things on an encrypted volume is manually traverse the folders on the Time Machine backup and copy them.   The folder structure is the same as what’s on your drive (i.e. /Users/user/Documents), the only thing is that you’ll have multiple copies for each date Time Machine ran.  It will be time consuming, but it will achieve what you’re looking to do.\nGoing even further Forward, it’s worth thinking about how you Structure your files for backup and archival now.  This will make it easier to store your files for archival purposes without having to negotiate the complexities of Time Machine.\n\nA: Do you really need to encrypt the backups themselves?\nThe simplest solution to protecting them would just be to store them on an encrypted hard disk. If you have a spare external drive, just format it as an encrypted disk using Disk Utility, or turn on FileVault for that volume (via Preferences->Security&Privacy). My understanding is that both of those methods are, for all of your intents and purposes, identical (the only meaningful difference affecting encrypted boot volumes). Then copy your TM backups on to it the encrypted volume.  From then on, you can mount the encrypted volume - entering your encryption password, and then use the disk as normal until you're done, and then unmount it.\nI guess if your TM backups are on a disk of their own, you could just turn FileVault on for that disk - even simpler/quicker.\n", "Q: How to check what communication mode is being used with an external monitor over the USB-C/Thunderbolt plug If I understand correctly, if you connect an external monitor to a Mac there is more than one way the signals can be sent to the monitor.\nIt could be HDMI, it could be USB Two-lane Displayport, it could be USB four-lane DisplayPort Alternate Mode, it could be Thunderbolt Displayport, it could be Displaylink.\nIs there some place on the Mac it will tell me which mode is being used?\n\nA: Yes.  System Report.  Click on the Apple Logo (top left of Menu Bar) *About this Mac → System Report → Graphics/Displays\n\nThat said.....\n\nIt could be HDMI, it could be USB 2 lane Displayport, it could be USB 4 lane DisplayPort Alternate Mode, it could be Thunderbolt Displayport, it could be Displaylink.\n\nYou're confusing/conflating a bunch of things all into one big lump.  Let's see if we can sort through the confusion - and yes, the industry doesn't help at all in making things less confusing.\nThe technology...\n\n*\n\n*USB-C describes the physical port attributes (connector type) not the actual port itself.  It's actually a USB 3.x port or a Thunderbolt 3 port with a Type C connector, but we've been saying USB-C for short; and yes, doing things this way made everything overly complex and confusing\n\n\n*Your Mac (assuming 2018 or later because you referenced USB-C), natively outputs a DisplayPort signal.  Period.\n\n\n*\"Lanes\" just refers to the bandwidth of the USB or Thunderbolt signal.\n\n\n*USB Alt or Alternate Mode is when the DisplayPort signal is \"added\" or embedded in the USB signaling.  USB by itself doesn't have display capability so if your computer manufacturer enabled this capability (i.e. Apple 12\" MacBook), you will be able to connect an external display to your MacBook via the USB-C port.  From the Texas Instruments PDF linked above:\n\nThis configuration enables other protocols such as DisplayPort (DP) ... ... to transfer over Type-C cables\n\n\n\n*Thunderbolt is actually several signals all in one: PCIe, USB 3 (soon will be 4.0), DisplayPort 3.2 and Power Delivery.  If you connect your external display to a Thunderbolt 3 port, you're still connecting it to DisplayPort.\n\n\n*DisplayLink is a technology that allows manufacturers to embed the video signals on USB/Thunderbolt, Ethernet and WiFi connections.  This is something at the manufacturer level and really, the only time consumers actually get involved with this is when Apple doesn't include the drivers or there's an issue with it supporting something like daisy-chaining.\nWhat you connect to...\n\nIf I understand correctly, if you connect an external monitor to a Mac there is more than one way the signals can be sent to the monitor.\n\nNot exactly.  Generally speaking there's only one way signals are sent to your Mac and that's from a DisplayPort signal.  There are Macs with HDMI ports (Mac mini for, example) but since we're referring to the USB-C port - there's only one connection - DisplayPort.\nYour end device (monitor) may be HDMI, however, and depending on how that signal was converted, it my be unidirectional.  In other words, it won't communicate back that it's using HDMI.\nYes, you can use a USB-C to HDMI or DVI or even VGA adapter. The DisplayPort signal can be converted to these formats with passive or active adapters (I suggest active).\nFrom the Comments....\n\nIt would seem it would be nice to know is it (a) 2 lane and so I'm limited to 30hz at 4k (b) 4 lane and so all my USB bandwidth is being eaten and external storage will be slow, or (c) thunderbolt and so everything is good.\n\nThat's not how it works.  It's not just one big pipe where everything is shoved through and if you use so much of USB you reduce your video or frame rate.\nThe \"lanes\" that you're referring to have to do with the data lanes that can be sent.  This is not something that can modified nor utilized by the user in any way.  If you have a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port, using a USB 3 cable with \"4 lanes\" isn't going to improve your video or USB throughput in  any way.  What you need to focus on is the specifications of your hardware.  Looking at the specs\n\n\nIf your Mac has stated specifications, it has to meet those specifications.  Your peripherals also have to meet these specifications.  Whether you have 2 lanes or 4 lanes makes no difference.\n", "Q: My Notes App Disappeared I am using an iPhone 7+ and noticed my Notes application is missing this morning! I keep stuff in there I have trouble remembering so I always save it to my iPhone and iCloud when I add something to my Notes. I have 19 folders in there. When I go to Manage iCloud storage the only selection is to delete. When I open the notes icon there it only gives me information about the notes app. Where’d it go? How do I retrieve it? HELP!\n\nA: It is possible that it got deleted somehow. Yes Apple now lets you \"delete\" built-in apps.\n...Unless it is hidden. Do a search on your phone for \"notes\" to make sure it is not installed.\nYou would re-install a coup[le of different ways. 1) by going to the App Store, searching for \"Notes,\" tap on it and look for the familiar yellow on top of white icon. You can tap on it to make sure that the developer is \"Apple\"\nThen just tap the cloud download icon (the cloud with the downward pointing arrow) and wait for the App to install.\n...Or in your search results next to Notes is a \"View\" button. That will bring it up in the app store.

It was called the 3G, even though it was only the 'version 2' & carried the designation 2,1, because of its new 3G phone capability, rather than the previous GSM. After that came the iPhone 4… even though it was the 3rd gen not 4th, & they've been out of sync ever since.\nThey did briefly re-sync for the iPhone X, but the next year's XS threw that out again.\n", "Q: YouTube Displaying Homepage Incorrectly My girlfriend's iPad Mini has started displaying the videos on the YouTube app home screen incorrectly.\nPreviously the videos on the homescreen would display in rows, however now, despite the orientation of the device, the video displays at full width. It is almost like the app thinks it is on a phone rather than a tablet.\n\nIs there any way to restore the rows of videos? I checked the settings and couldn't see anything.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: They updated the app. I wrote 5 feedbacks to tell them that it looks stupid on an iPad. Do I have to scroll 2000 times to see my videos.

These frameworks are located within /System/iOSSupport which is why you're seeing that error message, as that directory (and the files within it) do not appear in previous versions of macOS.\n\nA: No way\nThere will be differences in the system APIs between different operating systems.\nPlus there will be new functions in the new OS which have no equivalent in older ones\n", "Q: Filter searches on the iOS App Store On the iPadOS App Store, there is a “Filters” drop down menu on the left side of the search bar that allows you to filter apps by what platform it supports, price, category, age, and sorting options.\n\nHowever, in iOS on my iPhone, I don’t see this drop down menu when searching. Are there any hidden buttons or features that allow you to filter search results in the iOS App Store like you can on iPadOS?\n\nA: No, there are not any hidden buttons or features to filter search results when searching from an iPhone.\nIt's done this way when viewing the App Store on iPadOS because iPhone apps can be run in iPadOS.  This is the default setting for developers using Xcode to create their apps.  Sometimes when searching, you just want to see apps that are designed only for iPads (developers determine if their app can be run on iPad only).\nBecause you can run an iPhone app on an iPad but not an iPad only app on an iPhone, Apple provides a way to search for only those types of apps.\n", "Q: Separate Time Machine backups for different partitions I have an older Mac mini with 3 partitions: one running 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7. I'd like to back these up via Time Machine, however, I'd like them to each be separate backups. Whenever I try to back up one partition to the TM drive (with all other partitions excluded), it works fine. When I boot into a different partition and back up, it uses that same backup, adding the other partition to the mix.\nHow can I make them each use their own unique backups?\n\nA: When you set a TM backup you specify which drive and partition to backup to. If you have an empty drive you can give it 3 partitions (or more) using disk utilities. Then when you back up your 3 partitions you can back each one up to a separate partition on the other drive. The real problem is that having three time-machine backups means your machine will almost always be backing up something. Since it backs up hourly I'd kick them off 15 minutes apart.\nThere are also extensions and apps that let you change the hourly backups to daily, or weekly. You could then back-up 10.5 on Wednesdays, 10.6 on Thursday, and 10.7 on fridays. Or back them all up once a day 7 days a week and separated the backups by 8 hours.\n", "Q: Into Finder, when clicking on a color tag, loading unfinishing and finally no folders displayed as expected I have a bad experience with color tag into Finder.

I don't recall any particular upgrade to either my operating system or mail server that may have triggered this, so I'm not sure why it's started happening as Mail has been happily using this mail server for many years.\nI've performed a connection test from within the Mail app and looked at the Mail logs and the mail server (postfix) logs and this is what I can see:\nLogs from Mail.app:\nINITIATING CONNECTION Aug 07 19:12:06.024 host:<my-mail-server> -- port:<port> -- socket:0x0 -- thread:0x6000002e2fc0\n\nCONNECTED Aug 07 19:13:07.110 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:<my-mail-server> -- port:<port> -- socket:0x6000032c4420 -- thread:0x6000002e2fc0\n\nREAD Aug 07 19:13:07.260 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:<my-mail-server> -- port:<port> -- socket:0x6000032c4420 -- thread:0x6000002e2fc0\n220 <my-mail-server> ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)\n\nWROTE Aug 07 19:13:07.272 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:<my-mail-server> -- port:<port> -- socket:0x6000032c4420 -- thread:0x6000002e2fc0\nEHLO [<my-ip-address>]\n\n// Followed by the basic SMTP handshake and connection test.\n\nLogs from postfix:\nAug  7 19:12:06 <server> postfix/smtpd[23750]: connect from unknown[<my-ip-address>]\nAug  7 19:13:01 <server> postfix/master[1324]: warning: master_wakeup_timer_event: service pickup(public/pickup): Connection refused\nAug  7 19:13:07 <server> postfix/smtpd[23750]: lost connection after UNKNOWN from unknown[<my-ip-address>]\nAug  7 19:13:07 <server> postfix/smtpd[23750]: disconnect from unknown[<my-ip-address>] unknown=0/3 commands=0/3\nAug  7 19:13:07 <server> postfix/smtpd[23750]: connect from unknown[<my-ip-address>]\nAug  7 19:13:08 <server> postfix/smtpd[23750]: disconnect from unknown[<my-ip-address>] ehlo=2 starttls=1 auth=1 quit=1 commands=5\n\nFrom the mail server logs it seems like the client connects, times out after 60 seconds, connects again and then instantly succeeds, whereas from the Mail logs it looks like it just takes 60 seconds to connect in the first place.\nI've tested the same mail server and credentials with both an iPhone and an iPad and neither of them have the same issue.\nIs there anything I can do to resolve this?\nEdit: I have just updated my operating system to macOS 10.15.6 and restarted but the issue still persists.\nEdit 2: I've just set up a new 2019 MacBook Pro and continue to experience the same issue, which suggests that it is an issue with the mailserver, but doesn't explain why it works fine on an iPhone and iPad.\n\nA: I only managed to solve this by changing the port that I was using on my mail server to send emails (I was using a non-standard port to bypass ISP filtering). When I changed to using TCP port 587 (the Message Submission port) the issue was resolved.\nI'm still not convinced that Mail and/or macOS (or possibly my mail server) is doing something weird as other devices (iPhone and iPad) use the non-standard SMTP port just fine.\n", "Q: Install backup of my old Mac on my new one I got a new MacBook Pro with Catalina on it. I made a APFS formatted Copy of my old Mac and want to install it on a separate Partition on my new MacBook Pro so that when I start the new MacBook I can switch between the new one and the old one but I can't figure out how to do that.\n\nA: You could use the Disk Utility to create a new APFS volume in your current APFS container. Next, download macOS Catalina from Apple App Store which will appear as the Install macOS Catalina application. Run this application and install Catalina in the new volume. Boot to the new volume and run the Migration Assistant application to transfer applications and data from the old Mac. This transfer is in the form of a copy. In other words, nothing is removed from the old Mac.\n", "Q: Does Apple Maps use Core Graphics internally? I'm curious to know if Core Graphics would be fast enough for the rendering of a map?\nOr maybe Apple has some internal high performance 2D graphics engine they use for Maps.\n\nA: Yes, Core Graphics – also known as Quartz 2D – is fast enough to render a map.\nTo prove the potential, find a vector representation of a map encoded as a PDF file. Using Preview.app, view the map. PDF rendering on Apple's operating systems uses Core Graphics.\n\nCore Graphics\nThe Core Graphics framework is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine. It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, and image masking, as well as PDF document creation, display, and parsing.\n\nYou can prove Maps.app on macOS uses Core Graphics using the nm tool:\nnm -m /Applications/Maps.app/Contents/MacOS/Maps | grep CG\n\nThe output shows numerous calls to Core Graphics:\n(undefined) external _CGAffineTransformEqualToTransform (from CoreGraphics)\n(undefined) external _CGAffineTransformIdentity (from CoreGraphics)\n(undefined) external _CGAffineTransformInvert (from CoreGraphics)\n(undefined) external _CGAffineTransformMakeRotation (from CoreGraphics)\n\nYou can see Maps.app is linked against the QuartzCore and CoreGraphics frameworks with otool:\notool -L /Applications/Maps.app/Contents/MacOS/Maps\n\n", "Q: Where should I place local executables on macOS?

This would let you keep all your own files organized in one place without needing to add a new directory to your $PATH.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of the \"move to applications\" window? \nA few weeks ago I downloaded Brackets from the internet. Now whenever I turn on my computer, I see the following popup and nothing I have tried will make it go away. Can anyone explain what this is, why it pops up, and what I can do to get rid of it?\n\nA: It's a mounted Disk Image [.dmg]\nYou should be able to right-click inside that window [over some empty space] & \"Eject Brackets Release 1.14\".\nIt should then not re-mount automatically. You can also simply discard the .dmg file once you've installed the app, by dragging to your Applications folder as indicated.\nAny Application delivered by this method should be run only after copying to Applications & not from the mounted Disk Image itself.

We wind up doing constant IT support for him. His biggest foible is that he goes into Contacts, accidentally selects \"groups\", and then gets flustered and unchecks the only group he actually has. Then the next thing you know, he's on the phone in a panic because he can't find any of his contacts. This has been known to happen more than once in a single day. It doesn't help that he lives several hundred miles away, so all this support has to be done over the phone. His son helps when he can, but he's not always around.\nIs there a way to simply disable the \"groups\" feature? He doesn't need it, and it's causing everybody involved a lot of grief.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no.  You cannot disable the Groups button on Contacts.\nHowever, there’s a few “operational” things I can think of that might solve the problem.\n\n*\n\n*Why is he spending so much time in “Contacts” to begin with?  Find out what he’s actually trying to accomplish and go from there.  For instance, is it just looking up contact info to make a call/send a message?\nIf so, then “hide” the Contacts App in a folder.  It can be launched from within those Apps themselves.  This might reduce his temptation to keep going in there.  In fact, the only time I go in there is if I have mass edits to make - I hardly ever use the Contacts App itself anymore.\n\n\n*Create a list of Favorites (Phone App).  This can be used for both calls and messaging; you can have independent  entries for calls and text messages for the same contact.  This will limit the exposure to the Contacts App altogether.  This way, the contacts show up, but you never see the “Groups” button.\n\n\n*The Groups button is actually “far away” from everything else in the Contacts App screen.  Is this a accessibility issue where there’s a physical/medical condition that’s causing inadvertent taps on Groups (yes/no answer - no need for details).  If this is the case, we can look at different input methods. For the screen to change, it more than just Groups.  It’s Group -> Something Else.\nWhat you can do here is take an image (even print it out) of what the Groups Box should look like, point to where “Done” is so he can exit.  Before panicking...just have him compare the image to what he sees on the screen.\n\n\n*Until screen sharing on iOS/iPadOS becomes a thing you can create short video clips (store on OneDrive or DropBox for easy sharing) of how to enter/exit the places he get’s stuck.  I’m sure you’re finding that you’re repeating yourself very often.  If this is the case, a short video of how to get unstuck might work wonders.\n\n\n*You can use video chat to “show” him how to fix his issue.  It’s not limited to FaceTime.  Use Skype if he has a PC.  It’s free and not a data harvester like WhatsApp or similar.  He can easily hold the phone to the webcam (if he doesn’t have one, get one - that might be the best $40-$50USD you spend this year).\n\n\n*Show him how to take a screen shot and kill an app.  If he gets stuck somewhere, he can take a picture of where he is then use messaging or email to mail you a picture of his “location.” At least from there, you can guide him (you can include these instructions with the picture of Groups settings I mentioned earlier.\n", "Q: Where is the \"Open in Low Resolution\" setting stored for an app?

It can alternatively be done from command line as tmutil restore. See man tmutil for more information.\n\nA: In order to restore from “a point in time,” you have to have a backup from that point in time.\n\n*\n\n*APFS (since High Sierra) allows you to create snapshots of the startup volume\n\n*Time Machine is a time-tested backup and restore utility that allows you to recover from data loss\n\nThere is an inherent requirement, however, to use either of these tools to fix whatever has caused your data loss/corruption:  you have to take the snapshot or create the backup in order to restore from them.\nSince you stated you have a Time Machine Backup from “this morning,” you just need to restore it.  Apple Support has excellent step-by-step instructions on how to restore from a a TM backup (includes instructions on how to restore from a local snapshot as well).\nYou can quickly create a snapshot before you attempt something like installing questionable software or performing an update.  I do this all the time (never had to restore, thankfully).  Simply issue the command\n% tmutil snapshot\n\nYou will get a confirmation message that your snapshot was created.  To list the snapshots taken, just issue the command\n% tmutil listsnspshots /\n\nFinally, you can use Time Machine to restore from one of thise snapshots even if you didn't use Time Machine to create regular backups.\n", "Q: Observing what Spotlight's mdworker is indexing for diagnostic purposes There has been a history of people reporting mdworker processes taking up lots of CPU time on older machines, but apart from vague suggestions to just re-create the entire Spotlight index, I could not find any diagnosis information.\nMy (modern) machine has no performance issues, I would just like to understand the reason for the \"Service exited due to SIGKILL\" messages that flood my system logs:\ncom.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.mdworker.shared.00000000-0300-0000-0000-000000000000[6763]): Service exited due to SIGKILL | sent by mds[141]\n\nAre there any logs I could use to find out what is actually going wrong; i.e. whether the indexing processes are stuck at a certain file? Is there a way to increase the messages' verbosity?\nA bit of system information: This is happening on an iMac running Catalina (10.15.6), with just a few hundred GB of files. For testing purposes, I limited Spotlight categories (through System settings) to apps and contacts only, but that did not seem to make any difference. The machine has no directories where files might change constantly, no directories with excessive numbers of files and, as far as I know, no totally unusual file formats on it.\n\nA: I’m not sure whether there’s a more detailed log generated by mdworker or mds themselves. You could use fs_usage to see what files they are reading though, run the following in Terminal:\nsudo fs_usage mdworker mds\n\nAs it says in the man page: “The fs_usage utility presents an ongoing display of system call usage information pertaining to filesystem activity.

The main concern is that it might reboot while I'm in the middle of an important video call (which thankfully hasn't happened yet).\nIf it would be of assistance and if it doesn't contain any identifying information, I could post the problem report (the message is all greek to me and very long so I don't know if it's okay to post or not).\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You start by not opening so much tabs, or you can try a different plugin like RabbitMQ because the plug-in Could be the case.\n", "Q: How will Apple's switch to ARM (Apple Silicon) affect compatibility with Linux / Unix tools and APIs? At the moment, a huge argument for using Macs in academic and research settings (and possibly quite a few other use cases) is the compatibility with the Linux/Unix ecosystem, through Homebrew, Macports and similar projects, and of course the classical terminal (nowadays using zsh) that allows control over system internals. Users in many areas would not be able to work with a \"plain\" macOS without access to specialized applications which are generally only available on Linux.\nIs there already information available as to what Apple's move to the ARM CPU architecture (\"Apple Silicon\") is going to mean for this compatibility? Will it still be possible to compile programs from source on macOS? How about graphical Linux tools, will there still be a possibility to use X / Wayland / whatever on the Mac?\nI do understand that it is possible for Apple to arbitrarily restrict the OS in order to make it as hard as possible for users to do that. My question is aimed more at the practical / technical side of things: Is it enough to say \"compiling for ARM is easy enough, no worries\" or are there hidden issues?\n\nA: The betas of Big Sur (on Intel, at least) have the all the same Unix underpinnings and other components as before. (Even python 2.7, which was widely expected to be removed!)\nYou would hear a lot of noise it if Apple ditched its 'certified Unix™' status.\nXcode isn't going anywhere either, so you can compile any Unix code you've got source for.\nAs for X11, that hasn't been updated for years, so will have to run in emulation until someone recompiles it (hopefully fixing the Retina display issues while they're at it).\nThere may be teething problems, particularly in the early days. But I'd say that recompiled code is likely to have fewer problems than Rosetta emulated stuff.\n", "Q: MS Remote Desktop on MacBook running Yosemite I am running Yosemite 10.10.5 on my 13\" MacBook (Early 2014) and I want to make remote connections to a Windows PC.

I'm running notes Version 4.7 (1111.23) on macOS Catalina (10.15.6) and I have a couple documents I want to disable bullets and number formatting.\nIn TextEdit, the number formatting isn't as aggressive as in Pages or Notes and I wonder if I'm missing a way to disable that either all together in Notes app or better to disable it on the few notes where I just want to type and not get assistance in numbering.\nTo be clear - I understand that after I type the following, it corrects my typing and prompts for another dash list entry:\n-spacetestspacereturn\nSimilarly, when I type:\n1.spacetestspacereturn\n... the number and period and space engage the automatic numbered list and return makes 2. show up automagically.\nI know I can change the text later among bulleted, list and number. The change I wish is to not have the app change my text at all on a document where I type numbers and period and then a space.\nCan automatic numbered list / number formatting be turned off in Notes?\n\nA: The option is Edit - Substitution - Smart Lists. Turn it off and it won't auto-format lists anymore. This option seems only available on macOS though.\n\nA: The workarounds I've found is I have to change my typing as I don't know a way to disable thus (yet).\nPutting a # in front of the number or refraining from typing the period seems to get me what I want in the short term without using another app and typing in notes on macOS.\n\nA: For iphones/ipads, a helpful tip is to make a keyboard shortcut. In my case, when I type comma dash space I get \"- \" which formats my lists on the notes app. In settings (for iphone/ipad), go to General > Keyboards then add shortcut of your liking. For example, my phrase would be \"- \" and shortcut would be \",- \".\nRemember: your shortcut might transfer to your macbook keyboard, so use something intuitive.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: \"Item not available\" error when trying to upgrade to High Sierra I'm trying to upgrade my Macbook Pro late 2011 from Sierra to High Sierra via this link:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?ls=1&mt=12\nHowever, when it opens the itunes store shows this error:\n\nTo be safe I tried it with the Mojave update via this link here:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828?ls=1&mt=12\nand it gave me the same error.

I've recently dug out my old 5th Gen (A1421) model iPod Touch and put it back to factory settings. It's currently running version 6.1 (10B141) of its OS. I don't want to find that a software update has broken it one day, so my goal is to keep it offline as much as possible (specifically, Airplane Mode) and have it only talk to my PC, a Xubuntu 20.04 Linux machine. In line with this goal, I've never linked it up with any sort of iTunes software or Apple account.\nIt was my hope that with the iPod set up as above, I would be able to connect it by USB to my PC and transfer files as I pleased. My goal is to use it to play mp3s. After all, Linux typically ignores whatever file system visibility restrictions that the connected device is trying to enforce. Now that I've tried that, my PC is only reporting that two devices exist: \"iPod\", contained only an empty DCIM folder, and \"Documentes on iPod touch\", containing nothing. When I try to move files to either of these, I either get an error message saying that a file doesn't exist or an error message saying that a directory doesn't exist. Unlocking the iPod does not change this, and the iPod does not seem to respond at all to anything that I'm doing on the PC, other than trying to charge its battery from my machine.\nSo, given my goals, what can I do to be able to move files between the two devices? Could anything that I've done, such as putting the iPod in Airplane Mode, be to blame for my difficulties? I have managed to use ifuse to get new files on to the iPod, but the iPod itself shows no signs of recognizing them.\n\nA: TL;DR — Try GtkPod. If no luck, install the latest version of libimobiledevice and try Rhythmbox. You may need to bootstrap the process using iTunes. You may be completely out of luck with a 5th-generation iPod Touch.\niPods and iOS devices use a proprietary database-style design, with seemingly arbitrarily named files scattered around the filesystem; not a simple artist/album/track hierarchy of audio files like you probably have on your computer. You will not be able to achieve what you want just by using a file explorer. What you're looking for is a drop-in replacement for iTunes, software which understands how the iPod handles music files. Back in the the day, YamiPod was a very good option (I personally used it on Windows Me, since iTunes only supported XP onwards), and GtkPod is still a popular choice for Linux users of older devices, but both now appear to be unmaintained.\nMost music library managers and players for Linux, such as Rhythmbox, have implemented iPod syncing (music only), so I'd try using that, but YMMV. For a larger list of such software, see Comparison of iPod file managers on Wikipedia (though do note that some of the info there about what supports what seems to be outdated).\nUnder the hood, most apps that support interacting with iPods and iOS devices, including Rhythmbox, use libimobiledevice, which is an impressively feature-rich API. Unfortunately, there is a clear lack of user-friendly software that takes full advantage of it (beyond music syncing). The library is probably available in your distro's repos, but they may not have the latest version; ensure you have the latest version installed if syncing in Rhythmbox doesn't appear to be working. It doesn't have support for the latest devices/iOS versions (indeed, their FAQ emphasises the lack of full support, but doesn't go into detail about what specifically is and isn't supported), but I believe there is good support at least up to iOS 6.1.2, so it's worth a shot.\nIf none of that works, or if you want to explore additional functionality, take a look at the Debian article on the subject.\n", "Q: Macbook pro default apps installed under different apple id? I just got a 13 inch MacBook pro, and it came with a lot of default apps installed (e.g. Garageband, iMovie, numbers, keynote, pages, etc.).

Is there a way to fix this other than deleting and reinstalling everything?\n\nA: Sure, delete the app in question from the Mac and empty trash.\nThen open the App Store from the account (fast user switching type of account) you want to manage updates on that Mac. Sign in to the App Store if needed with the AppleID You prefer for your updates.\nGet those apps tied to the correct AppleID.\n", "Q: How can an iPod touch play mp3 transferred as files on storage instead of Apple sync using iTunes? I am currently looking for ways to transfer files from my Linux machine to my version 6.1 iPod Touch. Following this guide, I have been able to use the ifuse package to treat my iPod Touch like a USB stick and put the mp3s that I want on it. However, after dismounting the iPod, I can't find anything on it that acknowledges the existence of the new files. So, I have the following questions:\nI don’t know which (if any) folders of my iPod Touch process files or make them available to any music player app.\nNote: The iPod Touch is on version 6.1 (10B141) of its OS and is a 5th Gen (A1421) model. It may be assumed that it has been reset to factory settings and has never seen iTunes or an Apple account, and never will.\nAre there apps or folders to which a native app will play these mp3 once they are copied via USB to a Linux machine?\n\nA: The native app for music playing on the iPod touch assumes music files are stored in a database that indexes their local storage in a sandboxed manner. Since it was designed to only receive songs by syncing with itunes software directly from Mac or Windows supported OS, it’s not clear there is a general folder that gets indexed or processed for playing like some other apps that expect to be thrown a folder of files to play.\nFor Linux, you should use an alternative software \"rhythmbox\" to accomplish this import to the database of playable files.\nIf you use ifuse, it will only transfer the songs like an usb drive for storage only and not for playing. This mirrors the storage function of the original iPods where you could dump files, but they’re not indexed or processed for apps to use. The files app for iOS came after your version of iOS so this function to store and play arbitrary files came later than iOS 6 and isn’t available to you. Perhaps others know a player app that might be able to play these or jailbreak your device to add this function.\n", "Q: FaceTime HD camera stops transmitting live video in Catalina -- how to fix? At some point in Catalina's evolution (10.15.5+ ?) situations started recurring where there’s no video with the Thunderbolt Display attached and the MacBook Pro in closed clamshell mode when attempting a videoconference via FaceTime or other videoconferencing app (Skype, Zoom, etc). What is strange is that the Display FaceTime HD camera is selected and the green LED is illuminated. I also tried disconnecting the Thunderbolt Display to see whether the MacBook Pro’s built-in FaceTime would transmit live video — and it did. But then there was no audio! I was able to reconnect the Thunderbolt Display to regain audio, but of course there was no live video.\nThe workaround for this problem is to restart the computer.\nHas anyone else seen this problem, and is there a fix besides restarting?\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but just in case it helps someone else who lands on this page: it seems this is related to a bug with MacBook Pros after they wake up from sleep. You can deal with it by simply restarting the camera plugin. Close the videoconference app, open Terminal and type:\nsudo killall VDCAssistant\n\nType in your password at the prompt and that's it. If the issue was related to the wake-up-from-sleep bug, then the Thunderbolt Display camera should be working once you start the videoconference app again.\n", "Q: How to change the order of the virtual desktops Is it possible to change the order of the desktop assigned to each monitor? It used to be setup so that they where all in sequence, 1 (laptop), 2, 3 however after working in a remote location for a while and plugging back in the monitors it switched to 1 (laptop), 3, 2 and now things are launching on the wrong screen. What can I do to get this fixed?\n\nA: This occurs when the Mac fails to recognise the displays correctly. At reconnect, it 'forgets' what physical order you had them in.\nOne of the users on Ask Different made an app to keep a tighter hold on this - which I'm afraid I've been unable to track down. I hope they find this question & leave us a link to their app again.\nIn the meantime, a workaround would be to re-arrange your display order in System Pref > Displays > Arrangement.\nYou can drag individual displays into whichever order you would prefer.\nIf you click & hold any display it will highlight in red - on the control panel & also right round the display that is referenced, so you can easily tell which is which. The primary display is the one with the menu bar [which can also be moved, if needed]\nImage showing 3 monitors, centre highlighted, primary assigned to left-most.\n\nIf your Mac is suffering from this 'forgetfulness' you may need to re-do this each time you change your connected monitors [hence the need for the app mentioned above.]\nI'm assuming this is not actually the same as How to prevent Mac from changing the order of Desktops/Spaces which is actually a different issue with a simple fix in prefs.\n\nA: Mission Control shows the order of desktop spaces. It may show the order of your monitors as well. In mission control, you can move windows to a different order by clicking on the window at the top and moving it around to where you want it - which order you want them in. I don't know for sure if it works with different monitors but it's easy to check.\n", "Q: Preview shows logical page numbers only in thumbnail view I have been noticing a weird quirk lately in Preview - on Mojave 10.14.6 - when viewing PDFs with logical page numbers (those that start with roman numerals and then switch to Arabic numbers). Preview recognizes that the file starts with logical page numbers but only in the left-hand thumbnail view and not in the title bar, meaning that using Go to Page (Option + Command + G) sends me to the wrong page (page 18 instead of 7, for example). I have tried Apple's official solution, which is to select the option to use logical page numbers in Preview's preferences, to no avail.\n\nDoes anyone know any solutions to this bug?\nThanks!\n\nA: I tested myself. On 10.13 (High Sierra), it's exactly like what the OP described. On 10.15, the problem has been fixed and working correctly.\n\nA: I've tested the behaviour in Mountain Lion, and Go To Page does indeed work with logical pages. (For instance, I can type in 'ii' for a page with a Roman numeral section.) That doesn't work in Mojave.\nIt could be a bug, though it's possible that Apple changed the feature, so that PDFs with two page ranges using the same numbers can be navigated more effectively.\n(The titlebar has always shown the total number of pages and the physical index of the current page.)\nIt would be worth submitting feedback to Apple on this.\nPreview is 'not the best' PDF viewer and editor, and there are many others that do a much better job.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 16 Thunderbolt ports dead/damaged twice after used with Samsung CJ89 43\" monitor with USB-C I have a brand new 2019 MBP and I hooked it to a Samsung CJ89 43\" monitor directly through USB-C. It worked for a while and then suddenly the built-in screen started flashing and then the connection to the monitor was lost. The laptop reboot itself and now all 4 of the thunderbolt ports are not charging anymore. What's worse is all above happened last week. So I took it to Apple store and got it repaired. Basically they replaced the logic board and Touch ID on the device.\nNow, I plugged the replaired MBP to my monitor with the same USB-C cable which is the original one from Samsung come with the monitor. It worked for a while. But the nightmare happened again suddenly. I can hear the fan go wild and it alerted with message \"USB ports disabled, unplug ...\". All the 4 ports are not charging AGAIN!\nI tried everything like reset SMC and NVRAM etc, none of them working. Very frustrated at the moment. I'm not sure where the problem is and how can I solve this? I booked in another Genius Bar appointment on Tuesday. However,  the thing is, even if it's replaced or repaired - again, I really can't tell what is causing the issue and I'm afraid of plugging it to the USB-C port on my Samsung monitor after that.\nNeed some help and advice please.\n\nA: I know you’re frustration and you’re hoping against hope that it’s something simple, but the evidence is pointing to a defective monitor. Apple may decline warranty service for this second repair if plugging into the same monitor causes the same issue.\nI answered a very related question regarding monitors and warranties.\nIs it safe to connect external screen to MacBook via USB-C from the warranty perspective\nIn short, you should feel confident that plugging in your monitor, especially a known brand like Samsung is a safe procedure. However, if it’s found that the monitor is what is the cause, they may direct you to Samsung to cover the repair costs - and would legally be within their rights to do so. Samsung isn’t perfect, nor is Apple and it’s not unreasonable that Apple decline something that‘s not their fault.\nI’m not a lawyer and this should not be construed as legal advice, just my opinion based on many years of this type of experience.\nBottom line is you may get it repaired or you may not.  But, if you do, before plugging it in for a 3rd time, it would be in your best interest to not plug you Mac into that monitor until you get it checked out.\nIn fact, as a DYI test, you can try a USB-C meter inline with another device (like a sacrificial Android tablet) and see what your power is being sent by the monitor. Anything cheap and you don’t mind losing. Anything but your Mac. If you see  more than 20V @ 5A and/or you fry the test device means  you’ve definitely got a problem with your monitor.\nIt’s highly unlikely Apple will fix this a third time\n", "Q: Where does Macbook Pro store wifi information?

My 2012 does have it (mini display port).\nSo let's consider it's possible.\nIt's said I need mini display to usb-c adapter. It's ok but not quite cheap. So finally we reached my question.\nI already have minidisplay to hdmi adapter. Now I'm wondering is it going to work if I purchase usb-c to hdmi adapter (since it's twice cheaper) and try to connect both adapters to each other?\n\nA: No.\nUnless explicitly mentioned in the official specifications for the machine, it can't.

I have a directory with a lot of files and subdirectories. I know there are a small number of large files contained somewhere within. What is a quick/easy way to identify one or more large files in a directory, including throughout all it's sub directories?\nI tried this:\nfind . -printf '%s %p\\n'|sort -nr|head\nfind: -printf: unknown primary or operator\n\nand this:\nfind -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' |sort -nr | head\n\nfind: illegal option -- t\nusage: find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ...

This doesn't directly report sizes so you can sort top 10, but you can quickly (fraction of a second) locate places where large files exist.\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSSize > 2000000000' | grep \"$(pwd)\"\n\nMore options are on this thread. Add or remove zeroes or pick your size threshold for finding large files.\n\nAs to your syntax errors and other problems you'll face is handling spaces in files and directories, hence the \" \" around $(pwd) so you can quickly get in territory where you need to learn a bit more about shells, pipes, white space and escaping words / variables. Worst case, isolate each one element above so you can learn what the output of the find command is telling you and they layer back the filters / processing once you have valid results.\nIf all you are after cleaning large files and you don't need a script and want to learn that later. I recommend system information, storage management or Daisy Disk. Finder also can calculate all sizes well for me in preferences if you want to interact as you navigate.\n\nA: BSD find (which is part of macOS) and GNU find (which is part of Linux distributions) use different options, so your examples won't work.\n\n*\n\n*You can install GNU find via Homebrew (brew install findutils) and then use gfind to get GNU syntax/options\n\n*For a quick solution, du -a TOP-DIRECTORY | sort -r will work as well. It lists both files and directories though, so it won't easily work within a script\n\n\nA: If you're looking for the largest file(s) in each directory and child subdirectories\nUse the du command:\ndu -ah . | sort -nr | head -n X\n\nWhere X is the number of results you want.  For example, if you want the top 25, substitute 25 for X.  If you only want the largest file, use 1.  It will list the output in \"human readable format.\"\n\nA: Do you need this for a script, or is a manual tool acceptable?\nI find Disk Inventory X is outstanding for identifying large directories and files.\n", "Q: Security Hardening Adobe Acrobat DC for macOS The Security Team is asking me to install the Adobe Acrobat DC (Version 2020.009.20067) package to our macOS laptops.

It is kind of impossible.\nIf you were me, what would you do?\nThank you so much in advance for your help\n\nA: I would start with one thing and that’s work on your time to patch in your environment. Measure how many endpoints are out of date and average time to get machines patched once Adobe releases an update (plan on 40 updates a year if you use the core CC suite - 15 if you just deploy acrobat).\n\n*\n\n*You can control it.\n\n*It’s something one person can tackle.\n\n*It is your best defense to get ready to take next steps on how the quickly patched software is used.\n\nIf you don’t have federated ID services, get that next. Then look at Adobe Console to use SSO / federation and then decide if you just manage apps and lock everyone out of Adobe Updates and have a side channel for patching. JAMF and Munki and Fleetsmith (cough, Apple) are the three solutions I would evaluate if you know nothing about MDM. If you know everything about MDM - still evaluate them and then expand to include your current MDM or others that might fit your niche.\nSecurity is a war of attrition and you will never have enough time to train, hire, manage but you can get better at evaluating your biggest gaps, work to close them and then repeat the observe, measure, plan, act, measure, react cycle.\n", "Q: Broken battery - downgraded performance I have old MacBook Pro that has a dead battery.  It is not charging, and displays always 0% battery charge.\nOS X is downgrading performance when battery level is close to something about 5% or 10%.\nIs that possible to turn off this feature, to be able to use its 100% performance without exchanging battery to new?\n\n\n\n\nA: On the older MacBook Pro models, it's not a software function that reduces power.  It's actually a hardware requirement, managed by the SMC to utilize both mains and battery to get full performance.  With a dead or missing battery it would actually \"downclock\" the CPU.\nMacBooks Run Slow Without Battery*\n\nIf the battery is removed from a MacBook or MacBook Pro, the computer will automatically reduce the processor speed. This prevents the computer from shutting down if it demands more power than the A/C adapter alone can provide.\n\nWith newer MacBooks and the release of Catalina's Battery Heath Management feature, you can control (very limited, albeit) whether or not performance is affected.\nHowever, in your case, you would actually see better performance if you removed or just disconnected your battery because the charging circuitry is using current that could otherwise be used for processing to try and charge a battery that will not hold a charge - in effect, you have a power \"drain\" on your computer which is compounding the issue.\n\n*\n\n*Fully charged MacBook Air turns off when power cord removed\n\n\n*Battery is draining with \"Power source: Power adapter\" in macOS Catalina\n\n\n*Macbook pro Mid-2012 not booting on battery.

I have an old MBP hard drive that has my old photos and documents stored on it. I have put it in a case and can connect it to my new MBP but it runs quite slowly presumably as it's so old. If I deleted the system files and applications so I theoretically use it as an external hard drive to access photos, music, documents etc on my new MBP would it speed up and still work?\n\nA: I wouldn't put much faith in an 11-year-old drive, long-term. I certainly wouldn't put the only copy of any data on it.\nThat said, so long as you never expect to boot from it again*, then the old System files are just waste space, deleting them would be harmless.\nIt wouldn't, however, give you any speed increase, merely more free space.\nOld 'spinny rust' hard drives are maybe 20 times slower than a modern SSD - even assuming a fast drive for its age, full SATA III support & a full-spec USB3 enclosure.\n*Not that a drive from a 2009 Mac would have an OS that the current Mac could boot from, even if it was completely up to date before you removed it from the old Mac\n", "Q: Apple Watch auto workout detection fails to detect local walks Apple Watch has a feature that detects workouts, including walks, and offers to record them. This feature works reliably for me anywhere but near home, where it never works (not for years). Is there a setting I missed that is required to enable this feature for local walks?\n\nA: As you have already linked, you can only enable and disable the option. All the magic of the detection is behind closed doors.\nIn my experience, especially for walks, it detects them best when your pulse raises.\nMy watch has a high detection rate for walks going uphill - simply because my pulse increases significantly.\nOtherwise we could make guesses which kind of detection mechanism are run in the background. Maybe, as you stated, it is less likely to detect a workout when you're near your home.

I have some issues with my Mac's limited storage. I want to upgrade it to 500GB with a third party SSD (970 EVO  Plus) but, on Apple's web site it says it can be upgraded to a maximum  to 256GB.\nShould I upgrade it to 500GB or stick with a 256GB upgrade? Please forgive that this question might violates the rules but i need a true help. (BTW neither Apple or Salers told me whether it is possible or not).\n\nA: There are two distinct questions here:\n\n*\n\n*Could you upgrade to 256G or 500GB\n\n*Should you upgrade to 256GB or 500GB\n\nLet's tackle this backwards and start with the question that precariously walks the line of being an opinion and out of scope....\nShould you?\nI'm going to take the official stance and say no.\n\nBTW neither Apple or Salers told me whether it is possible or not\n\nI don't know who \"Salers\" is but there's a reason they're not replying:   Apple's official position on the matter is that it was upgradable at the time of purchase.  The MacBook Air 11\" Early 2015 uses a proprietary PCIe 2.0 x2 interface meaning that from Apple's and any authorized service centers the only SSD that is supposed to go in there is an Apple PCIe 2.0 SSD module.  Since there were no after purchase options available, they're not going to reply to you.\n\non Apple's web site it says it can be upgraded to a maximum to 256GB.\n\nSo, despite what's stated by Apple, you're looking for advice to see if you can circumvent this specification.\nTechnically, you can install another Apple SSD module if it's PCIe 2.0 x2  provided it physically matches.\nCould You?\nNow, looking at this from an unofficial perspective....\n\nI want to upgrade it to 500GB with a third party SSD (970 EVO Plus) but, ... Should I upgrade it to 500GB or stick with a 256GB upgrade?\n\nNeither of these upgrades, as described,  are compatible because they don't conform to the Apple proprietary interface. They are off the shelf PCIe M.2 NVME SSDs  So, to connect any of these drives to the  proprietary interface you'll need an NVME adapter.  This will convert the industry standard interface to the Apple interface.  However...\nYou can't just grab this converter, plug it in and blast away with your new found storage and latest operating system.  You have to install (usually incrementally) macOS upgrades onto the original SSD before you can migrate to the new SSD.  Why?  Firmware and driver updates need to be applied to ensure your Mac can \"see\" this storage.  If you don't do this in the right order, your Mac won't simply won't be able to access the storage for you to use.\nThis is so finicky, that they continue evaluating compatibility with each new OS roll out.\nThe guy on the Internet said....\nThe question here is \"do you have the technical skill to do this?\"  Like Apple and the reseller/service provider you took it to, they are staying mum on the issue as will I because like them, I don't want to be \"the guy on the Internet who said this can be done\" then you attempt it and end up with a Space Grey paper weight.\nThis is not a knock on you whatsoever, but you must take stock in your technical ability to do this.  If Apple or authorized sellers won't come near this topic , I'm inclined to follow their lead in this case. If you absolutely must have this done, you need to seek out a trusted technical resource that can handle this for you.\nBottom line\nIf you do this, and decide to step out of Apple's \"box,\" remember it will be at your own risk and as always, YMMV. Do your research before purchasing parts or disassembling things.\nAnd...advice I always give people when asking what they should buy when purchasing a piece of equipment:\nBuy for what you think you'll need 3 years from now, not for what you need today.\n", "Q: iMac 2011 Graphics Card issue - Unresolved I have a weird issue with my iMac 2011 model. This is the iMac with the graphic card issue, so it happened to me as well.\nI tried everything except baking the graphics card, this is my absolute last resort. What I've done now is I installed Windows on the iMac, and guess what it works perfect, please don't judge but this was only for testing.\nSo now, why is it that Windows works but not OSX?\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on why this is?  Please do let me know.\nMuch appreciated.\n\nA: You need to repair/replace the GPU card.\n\nThis is the iMac with the graphic card issue, so it happened to me as well.\nI tried everything except baking the graphics card, this is my absolute last resort.\n\nIf you're going to bake it, you may as well just toss it into the bin and save the electricity/gas used to heat the oven.  Baking a PCB is about the worst thing you can do because...\n\n*\n\n*it assumes that the issue is a dry solder joint which the theory is re-flowing the solder will somehow fix the problem.  It ignores that the problem may be something simple like a bad capacitor, resistor or some other component.  Re flowing doesn't fix any of this\n\n\n*you're literally cooking the components on the board so if they weren't bad before, they're likely to be bad now.\n\nWhat I've done now is I installed Windows on the iMac, and guess what it works perfect, please don't judge but this was only for testing.\n\nWhy not judge?  That's a perfectly viable, creative way to test the viability of your iMac.  You got Windows working so you can see that from a hardware perspective, you've got a working machine (well, almost).  Nothing wrong with getting test results that give you definitive answers.\n\nSo now, why is it that Windows works but not OSX?\n\nIt's integrated graphics versus dedicated (discrete) graphics.  The Intel Core  CPUs have integrated graphics chipset (i.e. HD Graphics, Iris, etc.) as well as a discrete GPU like the Radeon HD 6970M (mobile chip).  When you boot into Windows, it defaults to the integrated graphics whereas macOS is likely set to use \"both\" integrated and discrete.\nHow to fix...\nYou've got two options\n\n*\n\n*The board itself can be repaired.  There are shops that do board level repair.  They can diagnose and replace the specific components that have gone bad.\n\n\n*Replace the GPU (link is about upgrade a 2009/2010 iMac, but it lists all 2011 compatible GPUs)  It may be quicker, easier, and possibly cheaper to simply swap out the GPU with another.  If you go this route, don't toss the bad GPU - you may be able to get a few dollars in scrap value from a board repair shop.\n", "Q: Duplicate the volume where macOS is installed and make it bootable I use my computer for work in software development. I have a new client that wants to install some special security software on my mac but I don't want to get that installed on my main operating system. To solve this problem I was thinking to install a second macOS system on a different volume.\nThe problem with that is that I need to spend a lot of time setting up all the software and configurations I use for development in the new volume. So I thought it would be great to just duplicate my main volume and be able to pick to which of the volumes to boot when I start.\nI couldn't find how to \"duplicate\" the volumes to have an exact copy of my main fully configured operating system but completely isolated from the other operating system...\nAny clue? Is this even possible?\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is with a commercial tool like Carbon Copy Cloner, which, as you can guess from the name, will do this easily. It is primarily targeted at making backups, but it can definitely do what you want in one step if you have the empty volume ready.\nThe free way to do this is to make a complete Time Machine backup, install macOS on a new, empty partition, and when setting up the new OS installation, you will have the option to restore from a Time Machine backup, and you restore from the one you just made. This is a lot slower, as it involves making 2 copies of your current drive and the macOS install takes time, but it is free and leaves you with a Time Machine backup.\nNote that you do not want to make an exact copy of your current drive the way a low-level utility like dd would. You want the new drive to have its own UUID, for example, so that tools can tell the 2 drives apart. Also, macOS now (Catalina) is actually 2 partitions, a read-only one with System files and a read-write one with User files, and you need to set that up properly. Plus the Recovery Partition is a third partition. You want to use specialized tools that know about and handle these kinds of special needs for creating a bootable macOS drive.\n", "Q: Make zoom use system proxy I'm in China, and Zoom on my Mac often gets stuck because of unstable connection to Zoom server.

Apache was easy to configure http Zeroconf broadcast port 80 on the LAN. What I am looking for is an Avahi type solution where I can configure services independent of the originating process.\nHow would I do it when using another server software like Tornado?\n\nA: You’ve got several choices here of existing libraries of open source code with quite good documentation. In essence, your server needs to know an IP address and then drop the service advertisement.\nHere’s JavaScript code to add http listener advertisement from one node.js based implementation:\nvar browser = mdns.createBrowser(mdns.tcp('http'), {resolverSequence: sequence});\n\nSince you mentioned Tornado - you might be interested in a python zeroconf library that does the same and also lists Avahi compatibility in addition to Zeroconf.\nThe example code to advertise a fake HTTP server is a bit longer than the node call above, but the code is all open source. Making a real HTTPS server isn’t much more code, so you might be close to your solution here.\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/blob/master/examples/registration.py\nThe core is what you’d expect - list the details and then advertise...\ninfo = ServiceInfo(\n    \"_http._tcp.local.\",\n    \"Paul's Test Web Site._http._tcp.local.\",\n    addresses=[socket.inet_aton(\"127.0.0.1\")],\n    port=80,\n    properties=desc,\n    server=\"ash-2.local.\",\n)\n\nzeroconf = Zeroconf(ip_version=ip_version)\nprint(\"Registration of a service, press Ctrl-C to exit...\")\nzeroconf.register_service(info)\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air camera's not working When I turn on the Photobooth or Zoom app, the green light keeps on blinking and the screen just shows gray color. What to do?\n\nA: A blinking webcam light means there’s a fault with your webcam.  It could range from a simple hang up of the hardware or driver to an out of date firmware update or the webcam has failed altogether.\n\n*\n\n*The first thing you want to do is reboot.\n\n*If the issue still persists, reboot in Safe Mode (hold Shift while booting).  This will make it so only Apple drivers and software is loaded to remove possible conflicts\n\n*Make sure your system is fully up to date\n\n*Run Apple Diagnostics (hold D while booting)\n\n*Try a USB webcam.  If you get to this point and the USB webcam works, it’s a hardware failure of the webcam itself. You’ll have to decide if you want to replace the webcam which requires disassembly of the display or get use a USB webcam.\n\n", "Q: Finder won't quit Finder will not quit.  Hard reboot doesn't fix it.  I can't install updates because they require the computer to restart, and it will not restart with Finder open.\n\nA: In order to properly quit finder, you need to open Activity Monitor. Once you’re in the app, select \"Finder\". Find the \"x\" at the top, and select \"Quit\" or \"Force Quit\".\n", "Q: How much space for bootcamp? I have around 100GB of space on my (27-inch, Mid 2017) iMac's SSD. I'm planning on using Bootcamp to play some Windows games, and I'm not sure how much space I need to leave for each OS.\nI'll be storing all the Windows programs and apps on an external hard drive, so I'm not sure how much I need to leave to Windows 10 itself. I won't be using Windows for much else. I know I have to leave some storage free on the Mac side, but I'm not sure how much.\n\nA: Windows 10 minimum hard disk space required is 32GB.  You need to start there, add up whatever your games/apps are going to require and allocate that much to the Bootcamp partition.\nYou get this information by looking up the minimum system requirements for each thing you want to install and adding them up. As a suggestion, most will give two values - the minimum and the recommended.  Always go with the recommended amount.\nThe key is to research!  I wrote this as more of a “tutorial” of sorts to show future readers how to obtain this info because the next release of Windows, macOS and whatever additional software  will change the specifics. Here’s some links to get you started:\n\n*\n\n*Bootcamp System Requirements\n\n*Windows 10 System requirements\nOnce I have everything accounted for based on the suggested values, I usually add 10% (like a contractor) as cushion. It better to “have and not need than need and not have.”\n\nA: While Microsoft states the minimum required space for the current release of Windows 10 is 32 GB, Apple states, when using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10, the requirement is 64 GB. Of course, you do not have to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10, but the additional space requirement may be partially due to the space needed to install the Window Support Software provided by Apple. Also, starting with the 2015 model Macs, the Boot Camp Assistant uses the internal drive to temporarily store the installation files from the Windows 10 ISO and a copy of the Windows Support Software. This allows installation of Windows 10 without the aid of a flash drive, but also increases the amount of space needed to install Windows 10. After Windows 10 is installed, this temporary space is returned to macOS and cannot be reallocated to Windows.\n", "Q: Cannot boot into macbook pro - Cannot access recovery mode I have a macbook pro 2019 with macos Mojave installed on it. It suddenly stopped working and stuck at apple logo for some unknown reason.\nI tried Command + R to access recovery mode. There is no error message. It shows apple logo and fills the progress bar. I waited for more than 30 mins but nothing happened. I tried releasing the keys immediately when apple logo appeared. Also tried holding the keys until the progress bar filled.\nThen I tried Command + Option + R for internet recovery. On the spinning globe screen, I connected to wifi network. After download, it gets restarted and again stuck at same apple logo. I waited for more than an hour everytime but nothing happened.\nAnd then I created a bootable usb and tried to install Catalina OS from it. The result is same, it stuck at apple logo.\nAs a last option, I installed macos in an external USB using my friend macbook. I tried to boot into external USB by holding Option key on startup. Again the same result, it stuck at apple logo.\nI also tried Command + Option + P + R to reset PRAM. Nothing worked. Assuming my macbook has T2 security, I cannot disable it since I'm unable to access recovery mode. Please suggest if there are any other options.\nI tried Apple diagnostics by holding down the D key. After checking for few minutes, it shows no problems found.\nWhen I try target mode by holding down the T key, it showed 2 icons, thunderbolt and usb. When I connected it to another MacBook Pro with a cable, the target MBP didn't show up in the host MBP. I did check in disk utility and network folder, not found anywhere.\nI tried the verbose mode by holding down Command + V keys. The logs shows 2 messages frequently. One is \"X86PlatformPlugin result 0\" and the other one is \"Interface link is not up, do not pull packets yet\". It keeps showing these 2 messages. Also seen \"kextd stall[0], (60s): 'IGPU'  \" and \"kextd stall[1], (60s): 'IGPU'  \". Attached a video link of recorded log. https://youtu.be/YFo9Ja63w68\n\nA: If you have access to a working Mac, the next thing I would try (after what you have already done) is to start the troubled MacBook Pro in Target Disk Mode by powering on the computer and holding down the T key until the Thunderbolt (or USB) symbol appears on the screen. Then connect it to the working Mac, mount the drive, and use Disk Utility to to verify and, if needed, repair the drive. Also take this opportunity to make a copy of the drive in case (a) the drive is failing or (b) you end up with a repair that includes a new drive. Obviously if Disk Utility cannot repair the drive, take it to Apple for service.\nIf the drive appears good but the computer still will not boot, the next thing I would try is running Apple Diagnostics by turning off the computer, turning it back on and holding down the D key while the computer starts up. If any issues are found, Apple Diagnostics suggests solutions and provides reference codes. Take note of those reference codes and give them to Apple when asking for service on the computer. Note that you need to be connected to the internet to run diagnostics. If D does not work (possibly because there is something wrong with your disk drive) you can use Option+D to load the diagnostics over the internet.\nIf the diagnostics show nothing wrong and the Target Disk Mode show nothing wrong with your drive, I would be pretty surprised. In any case, having made a backup of the drive from Target Disk Mode, if Disk Utility did not get the drive back into bootable shape, I would take the computer to Apple for repair.\n\nA: Stuck at the Apple Logo.  What to do.\nThis is an attempt to write a canonical QA for this issue, as per the Meta post:  Where is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different? I expect it to be periodically edited with the goal of becoming a comprehensive information resource.\nWhen you get stuck booting at the Apple logo, it can be really frustrating.  All you've got is a grey Apple and (maybe, but not always) a loading bar that's stopped moving.  The stuck logo means something has crashed and this Mac is going nowhere fast.  This document is written to help you figure out what the problem is/could be and take the next steps to getting things resolved.\n\nStart with Verbose Mode\nHold ⌘ Command V while booting.  This will boot in a non-graphical mode allowing you to see the boot time messages as they scroll by.  It's a good idea to have a camera recording this as it will capture all messages as it scrolls across the screen.  What we want to do is see where things are crashing so we can take appropriate action.\n\nBooting from Recovery (local)\nWhen you boot from recovery, you are booting from a different boot partition on your drive.  It's a clean version of macOS that will allow you to use drive utilities, open Terminal to run commands and even do a full re-installation of your operating system.  If you can boot to Recovery, this means your hardware is likely good and you have a problem with the macOS installation itself.\n\nBooting from Internet Recovery or via USB\nYou can boot into [Internet Recovery][inet-recovery] by using ⌘ CommandR or via a bootable USB device by holding ⌥ Option and selecting the boot volume.\nThe goal here is to eliminate your boot device from the equation.  If you can boot from Internet Recovery or from a bootable USB, then you've narrowed down your issue to a physical problem with either the boot device (drive) or the drive interface (SATA, PCIe 2.0 interface).  You may have to replace the SSD or hard drive depending on your Mac, but if the storage is integrated onto the logic board, it will have to be replaced.\nHowever, if you are stuck here,  you have a hardware issue.\nInternet Recovery downloads the OS installer to memory - you don't even need a hard drive installed/attached to download and run the installer properly.  So, if you're attempting to boot and it gets stuck, you need to look at hardware being the problem.  Same with a USB installer - you're using the USB bus and not the SATA or PCIe interfaces bypassing the traditional channels from which your drive operates.  If you can't get past this point, it's definitely a logic board issue.\nPossible Diagnostic Tests\nYou can try a boot Apple Diagnostics by holding D  while booting from a powered off state. However, Apple has been reducing the usefulness of this utility on newer Mac models.  You're not likely to get much useful diagnostic data.  You can try Memtest86.  They have instructions to create a bootable USB, however, since all components are now soldered to the logic board the end result will be the same - the logic board needs to be repaired/replaced.\n[inet-recovery]:\n", "Q: Apple Pencil life span Recently I bought Apple Pencil (1 with lightning charger) for my iPad Air 3. My question is relating to the life span of this pencil.   I use it about 5 hour a day usually.\nDo we know how many years I could expect my pencil to work?\n\nA: The pencil should last several years if you're careful with it. The two ways it will fail are physical damage and eventual consumption of the batteries. One way you won’t get long life out of a pencil is if you don’t use it and keep it charged monthly.\n\n*\n\n*Avoid hard drops to the hard floor.\n\n*Avoid never charging it or letting the battery go totally flat\n\nThings you can fix are overuse, the tips wear out in a year or so of moderate to heavy use. Apple sells replacement tips for your pencil at 4 tips for $19.  Apple also offers battery service for $30.\nThis link will describe how to tell if tip is worn. You may want to check it out.\n\nA: If you don't charge it every few weeks, the answer is less than a year. They don't tell you this, but i bought one, never used it, and it is dead. I threw away my money. You have to keep charging it or it dies.\n\nA: My only lasted about 15 months. I used it every now and then to draw on procreate, I always kept it charged attached to my iPad and last week I leaved it in my car glove box(like many other times) along with my iPad then when I tried using it it was dead, unresponsive. I never let it die it was as always attached to the iPad fully charged. My guess is that it will only last the warranty period like many products,now I’m looking for a cheaper alternative before I drop another $130.\n\nA: I bought the apple pencil in 2019, and it worked great back that time. Then 2020 happened and I did not have the opportunity to use it for about 10 months. Now, when the classes are resuming I see the pencil is dead. The only option available is to buy a new one; as another user said you need to keep charging it. It seems nothing more than an expensive toy!\n", "Q: Applescript: move all files with a certain extension to the trash This is very straightforward; it moves myfile.WMA to the trash:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    move POSIX file \"/Volumes/DS_30/myfolder/myfile.WMA\" to trash\nend tell\n\nBut how would I move all files in myfolder with a extension of .WMA to the trash?\n\nA: Using your example volume and folder name:\ntell application \"Finder\" to ¬\n    move (every item of ¬\n        container (alias \"DS_30:myfolder\") of ¬\n        application \"Finder\" whose name extension = \"WMA\") to trash\n\n\nA: You can use AppleScript's filter reference form - for example:\nset myFolder to (choose folder)\ntell application \"Finder\"\n   try\n      set theItems to files of myFolder whose name extension is \"wma\"\n   on error errmess -- shell script\n      log errmess\n      set theItems to paragraphs of (do shell script \"/usr/bin/find \" & quoted form of POSIX path of myFolder & \" -depth 1 -iname '*.wma' -print\")\n      repeat with anItem in theItems\n         set contents of anItem to anItem as POSIX file as alias\n      end repeat\n   end try\n   move theItems to the trash\nend tell\n\nNote that the filter reference works for application objects, not regular AppleScript objects such as lists and records.\nEdit\nAdded a statement to perform a find shell script in the event of an error.\n", "Q: iPhone charging from MacBook Air 2017 I have an issue when I plug in my iPhone 11 Pro Max into my MacBook Air 2017. The issue is that it starts to charge for like 1 second, disconnects for 5 seconds, and then loops like that. Do you think the issue could be with the port or the software?\nI am running macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and iOS 13.6.\nEdit: It was a lightning cable issue. Other newer lightning cables work fine.\n\nA: \nThe issue is that it starts to charge for like 1 second, disconnects for 5 seconds, and then loops like that.\n\nDirt or another containment in the port isn't going to cause a loop that cycles in a regular intervals.   When you connect an iPhone to a MacBook, there is a charging negotiation - normally, the USB spec is for 5V @ .5A, but the MacBook can \"boost\" the available charge up to 2.5A - it has to \"ask\" for it, however.  That \"loop\" that you're seeing is a connection, an ask and a disconnect and then the device trying again.\nIt could be a couple of things...\n\n*\n\n*You have an issue with your port not being able to supply enough power to the phone\n\n*You don't have sufficient power on your USB bus\n\n*There could be a hardware issue - either with the MacBook or the iPhone\n\nIf you can charge your phone correctly otherwise (i.e. with a regular USB power adapter) and your USB port functions normally, start with an SMC Reset.  If that doesn't fix it, try Safe Mode by holding ⇧ Shift while booting.  But, to be candid, I don't see that having much effect, if any at all.  Charging is not handled by the OS, but by the firmware on the SMC chip.  In this case, ensuring your firmware and software is fully updated would be the next best thing.\nLastly, you want to ensure that your connectivity is good - avoid cheap, knock off cables and connectors.  I assisted someone just yesterday who insisted against my advice on using one of those 5-way USB spider things that has all the different USB connectors on one cable she picked up at a trade show;  It fried her Dell XPS' charging ports.  Use good quality cables from trusted brands (I like Anker personally). Saving $5-10 on a cable simply isn't worth it.\nIf it is the hardware (either phone or Mac) you might just want to avoid charging with your Mac and stick to the wall adapter.  To fix it would require replacing logic board(s) and it may not be worth the expense.  If it's under AppleCare...well, that's a different story altogether.  You'll have to make the call to see if it's worth the AppleCare incident for this issue.\n", "Q: Why will Time Machine not restore Mail?

You need to copy and paste over the SDK for the iOS version that your phone runs on into this file location: <where ever xcode is located on your machine>/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport.\nAfter downloading the appropriate file, you can go to Terminal and paste this:\nunzip /Users/yourname/Downloads/13.5.zip\ncp ~/Users/yourname/Downloads/13.5 ~/Users/yourname/location/of/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.plaform/DeviceSupport\n\nHere's the link to the SDK for iOS version 13.5 (includes 13.5.1) that you need to paste over.\nYou can also update to Catalina to get a later version of Xcode, but I don't recommend it if this is the only thing you're doing it for.\nApple no longer allows you to downgrade your iOS version, so that option is now, sadly, null.\nEdit: I just wanted to make it clear that this approach works for all versions of iOS, not just 13.5.

Make sure to unzip the file before pasting it though.\n", "Q: Screen won’t lock after upgrading to Catalina I recently upgraded my 2018 Mac mini to macOS Catalina 10.15.6, and I’ve noticed that whenever I turn my monitors off and leave my computer, it never actually locks itself after the 10 minutes when it’s left alone. Is there any way to fix this? I can manually lock the screen and make it go to sleep but that’s kind of a pain to do every time I want to leave my computer.\n\nA: Check the battery settings in the Energy Saver. You should be able to see a dial to change the time needed for your Mac to sleep. The defaults for these have been known to change from time to time, so you may be able to put it back to what it was originally.\nIncidentally, locking your computer by leaving it unattended for 10 minutes is not a good security practice. If you want a quick way to lock it, see here for sleeping and here for locking. This is a habit that is worth picking up.\n", "Q: Sharing iOS pictures onto private cloud I and my partner have an iPhone which we use for taking pictures. We would like our pictures somewhat combined on a private server (Linux; e.g. NextCloud, WebDAV etc -- scripting/automation on the server is definitely an option). NO iCloud. The \"owner\" should be preserved.\nIdeally, each of our iPhone pictures would just be rsync'ed to a folder on the server. Then we would both find all of our pictures on the server, in separate folders and can use symlinks etc. to organize them.\nNextclouds Auto Upload function seems to come close. However, it's not really reliable. Worse so, it copies the pictures as soon as they are taken and does not \"rsync\" the iPhone picture library. We take lot of pictures and then delete most of them. Nextcloud want to upload all of them, even when we delete them afterwards. In that case, uploads hang and generate error messages. If we delete a picture on the iPhone after it has been uploaded to NextCloud, it is not deleted on the server.\nI know iOS is such a hopelessly closed system with barely opportunity for automation but I still hope we can find a somewhat reasonable flow. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Have you considered Dropbox? Dropbox is NOT a server and it's not exactly what you want but Dropbox could be installed on a Mac or spare iPad and share permission given to you both. Both of you would need to install Dropbox on your respective machines. Dropbox may be too expensive for photos as they take up more space than most other files.\nIf you don't have a Mac or spare iPad you could both just install Dropbox and one could give share permission to the other.\nOn a Mac, using the terminal, one can cd to Dropbox and use shell scripts to manage the files there.  The same thing can probably be done on an iPhone.\n\nA: Take a look at Synology to see if it suits your needs.\nhttps://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/photo_vs_moments\n\nA: iOS isn’t closed at all for file app sharing on SMB and other clouds. You can set up your own VPN as well if you wish to emulate the cryptographically secured upload that iCloud implements for general file sync as well as photos app synchronization. As you note, iCloud is explicitly closed to any apps and storage services except Apple’s for privacy reasons AFIAK.\nThere are more apps on the App Store than you can shake a stick at that handle photo syncing. I don’t see any that I trust more than Apple, but I’ll assume you have a very good reason you didn’t mention to not want your photos with Apple.\n\n*\n\n*https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kwilt-your-private-cloud/id1003799569\n\n*https://www.rsync.net/ (If you’re technical this may be a great option for your storage)\n\n*https://www.on1.com/products/photo-mobile/\n", "Q: How do you establish an area in which to search (restaurants, for example) for Maps.app How do you constrain a search in Maps.app that could have hits anywhere? Like 'burger restaurant'?\nI live in Chapel Hill, and I want to see all burger joints in the Triangle, so I size my Maps window to enclose Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh. Then in the search box I type 'burger restaurants'. The display drops red pins around Chapel Hill, a few around Durham, and none at all around Raleigh. To see Raleigh burgers, I have to jigger the display around so Raleigh is more centered, and Chapel Hill and Durham are out of view.\nGoogle Maps simply assumes you're interested in all locations viewable within the current window. It's such a natural way I assumed Apple would do the same thing, but apparently not.\n\nA: It’s simply a limitation of Apple Maps.\nTo find places around a certain area, Apple touts the “Nearby” feature supposedly which allows you to find points if interest nearby your current location.  If I search “pizza near research triangle  park, nc” it gave me pizza places near the closest city center to me - downtown Fort Lauderdale, FL.\nI tend to use Bing Maps as my preferred tool followed by Google. I did the same search  in Bing and the search area was as you described - bounded by the visible area in the window. If I zoomed or panned the map, the results  adjusted accordingly.\nI have found that 3rd party apps “force” Google maps regardless of what you want as your default - I suspect it’s to ensure a consistent and rich user experience.\nWhile I’d love to recommend the native tool, I can’t.

USB-C is just the physical port type.  The ports on your MacBook Pro are actually Thunderbolt 3 ports and they use a Type C connector.  Thunderbolt has several signals:  PCIe, USB 3.x, DisplayPort and Power.\nSo, that port is natively outputting DisplayPort and the adapter you purchased is an actual video adapter that connects to USB and outputs DisplayPort.  It’s not working because your Mac doesn’t have the drivers for that particular adapter.\n\nA: What worked for me was to go to my monitor settings, where I could change the version of DisplayPort signal from 1.2 to 1.1. After that, my USB-C to DisplayPort cable works as just fine, without lag and in all resolutions (up to 4K).\nBackground:\nWhen I tried to hook up my AOC 4K monitor, I first tried it through my Lenovo Thinkpad Dock. For this to work on the Mac, I needed to install DisplayLink software, but for the 4K monitor, this causes lag because of CPU spikes when the graphics card needs to do stuff.\nI tried both USB-C to HDMI as well as USB-C to DisplayPort cables, which both gave the issue that the monitor would show up for a couple of seconds after the signal dropped again. I was reading up on compatibility, but I couldn't really figure out what was going on. I knew the cables were alright and the monitors would work fine with Windows and through the DisplayLink (via the Dock). I read people would alter some monitor settings, I didn't expect much but luckily my monitor allowed me to swap the DisplayPort version. Not sure if either my computer couldn't handle the DisplayPort 1.2 or the cable.\n\nA: Actually, I found on a 2019 MBP 16\" that when the integrated (Intel) graphics are enabled (default, if computer is running just idle after start) then it may not detect a display on usb-c / displayport.\nI solved it by installing gfxcardstatus ( https://gfx.io/ ) and switchted to discrete graphics, re-plugged and it worked.\nYet, in theory, you should be able to run some software that auto-switches to discrete graphics (e.g. Photoshop) and unplug / plug should work as well. Haven't tried but I assume this may do the job.\n\nA: This solution may not solve the issue for everyone: I am using the very same cable and I had a similar problem with a Dell monitor. The problem was the monitor, and not the Mac.\nWhat I did was resetting the monitor, in my case I had to basically unplug and press the monitor's power button for at least 10 seconds or more.\nAfter that, the Mac immediately recognised the monitor and connection was established.\n\nA: This might not be the solution for everyone, but it may save someone some frustration:\nYour Macbook's power adapter must be plugged in or it simply won't recognize that you've connected an external monitor.\nThis is at least true of the 16\" Intel MBP on macOS Monterey and it could very likely be true for other configurations.\n", "Q: Backing up home directory, can I exclude ~/Library? I want to backup the home directory of my Mac. For reasons I won't go into, using builtin Mac backup tools is not an option and the backup cannot be too large. Luckily I already have my own software to do the backup, so the first point is taken care of. For the second point, I know that the data that is important would add up to about 5 GB, which acceptable.\nWhen I took a look at my actual home directory however, it was way too big. It turned out that ~/Library alone takes about 50 GB.\nWhat exactly is the purpose of this directory, and what sort of files are expected to be in it? What are the consequences of excluding it from the backup?\n\nA: The Library folder contains all the preferences set for the applications you are using, login information for Mail etc, the local mail archive, your keychain and a lot of other configuration stuff. If you are using iCloud Drive it also contains the local copy of the drive content; and backups of your iDevices in case you don‘t use iCloud backup for them.\nYou may be able to recover most of it in case of data loss, but some things (e.g. your keychain or any locally stored mail) will be lost.\nGiven that external drives and USB sticks are rather cheap nowawdays it's most probably not worth the pain to fine-tune a backup script to include just the essentials from ~/Library.\n\nA: I will add this answer to document my own workaround.\nI take my backups using gtar (the tar utility from Linux; because the tar shipped with Macs is buggy) to create an archive of my ~. Since I keep everything important to me in ~, this works out.\ngtar supports excluding but the implementation is a mess and took a lot of troubleshooting to figure out. It seems to depend on the version of the program, I have v1.32 and the correct syntax and order looks like gtar --exclude=${HOME}/Library --exclude=${HOME}/OtherDir -cf archive.tar ~.\nThis shrinks the size of my backup to a reasonable size. The drawback is that Applications like to store their settings under ~/Library, so you would have to reconfigure everything. I solve this problem by separately backing up only those configuration files that I care about. Important configs are already symlinked and moved to my dotfiles repo as described here. Since my dotfiles are not in ~/Library, they get included in the backup (in addition to also being, in effect, backed up on Github).\n", "Q: Drop ship a preconfigured iPad to elderly in-laws?

If I forgot to plug in my Mac to the power and came back a couple of hours later, it may show \"Disk Not Ejected Properly\" notifications (two of them on Mojave).\nBut the notification display a \"Show\" and clicking on it has no effect. Clicking on the notification has no effect. So these two notifications are blocking all the view of other window content because they always stay on top of every other window. (they are blocking the tabs of Google Chrome)\nHow can they be removed?  Or else I have to close most everything and restart the Mac, which is a pain just due to this bug.\n\nA: The notification being there covering the screen and won't go away can be really troublesome.\nIt can be solved by moving the mouse to a \"blank screen\" hot corner. (set it up first).  And then when you wake the Mac, that notification can be dismissed.\nSo this is a solution, and would save Apple $27 / hour to hire a contractor to fix this bug in a day.\n", "Q: How To Use '`launchctl print`' as a Replacement for '`launchctl bslist`?' man launchctl' remarks that:\nLEGACY SUBCOMMANDS\n     Subcommands from the previous implementation of launchd are generally available,\n     though some may be unimplemented.

What arguments, then, would one pass to 'launchctl print' to get output like what the 'bslist' sub-command used to provide?  Would you need to filter it any (using grep, sed, awk, etc.) to get the desired result(s)?\n('launchctl print system' spews a bunch of data out, but I'm not clear on whether that includes the same information the 'bslist' sub-command would have output in the past or, if so, where in the former's output said information might be.  Its 'endpoints' key contains a list similar to the example provided in Listing 1 in the 'Mach Bootstrap Basics' section of this old, outdated Apple documentation on 'Daemons and Agents,' but I'm uncertain if that's what I'm looking for, particularly since it contains a couple extra columns.)\n\nA: Short answer\nUse:\nbash -c \"if [ \\$(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then domain=system; else domain=\\\"user/\\$(id -u)\\\"; fi; launchctl print \\$domain | sed -e '1,/endpoints = {/d' -e '/}/,\\$d' -e 's/.* \\([A|D]\\)\\(  *\\)\\(.*\\)/\\1  \\3/'\"\n\nIf you prefer a script, create a file, for example /usr/local/bin/bslist, with these contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then\n    domain=system\nelse\n    domain=\"user/$(id -u)\"\nfi\nlaunchctl print $domain | sed -e '1,/endpoints = {/d' -e '/}/,$d' -e 's/.* \\([A|D]\\)\\(  *\\)\\(.*\\)/\\1  \\3/';\n\nand make it executable: chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/bslist.

According to OS X 10.9 Mavericks' man page of launchctl, bslist\n\n(...) prints out Mach bootstrap services and their respective states. While the namespace appears flat, it is in fact hierarchical, thus allowing for certain services to be only available to a subset of processes. The three states a service can be in are active (\"A\"), inactive (\"I\") and on-demand (\"D\").\n\nTypical output is:\nA  com.apple.finder.ServiceProvider\nD  com.apple.udb.system-push\nD  com.apple.systemprofiler\nA  com.apple.systemuiserver.ServiceProvider\nA  com.apple.dock.server\n[...]\n\nwhere:\n\n*\n\n*the first column is the bootstrap service state (A for \"Active\" and D \"On-demand\")\n\n*the second column is the name of the bootstrap service\n\nprint, the new kid in town\nApple replaced bslist with an enhanced subcommand: print.\nWhy enhanced? As nicely explained here, bootstrap services are arraged in a hierarchical namespace. While bslist hides this complexity from the user by making the following assumptions:\n\n*\n\n*When run as root (whether it is via a root shell or sudo), bslist outputs the system-wide domain.\n\n*When run from as a non-privileged user, the target is assumed to be the per-user domain for that current user.\n\nprint takes another approach: it gives the user a finer control on the output by accepting the desired domain as an argument (see the man page of launchctl for details).\nMaking print behave like bslist\nLuckily, after running bslist in OS X 10.9 \"Mavericks\" and print in OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\" multiple times and comparing the output, I can confirm that all information provided by bslist is contained in print:\n\n*\n\n*The system-wide domain printed by bslist when run as root can is provided by the system option in the endpoints array.\n\n*The per-user domain is provided by print with the user/<UID> option, also in the endpoints array.\n\nThe exact commands are provided above in the short answer section of this post, here I revisit the script (with comments) for a better understanding of what it does:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Compare the user UID (from command \"id -u\") with 0\nif [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then\n    # If the user is root (that is, the user UID is 0), request \n    # the \"system\" domain\n    domain=system\nelse\n    # Otherwise request the user domain\n    domain=\"user/$(id -u)\"\nfi\n# Run launchctl\nlaunchctl print $domain |\\\n# Remove the output before \"endpoints = {\"\n sed -e '1,/endpoints = {/d' \\\n# Remove the output after \"}\"\n-e '/}/,$d' \\\n# Remove the port information and format the output as bslist\n-e 's/.* \\([A|D]\\)\\(  *\\)\\(.*\\)/\\1  \\3/';\n\nA few words on bootstrap services\nThis answer deals with bootstrap services, but, what are they?\nmacOS uses a hybrid kernel, called XNU, that combines the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and a C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit.\nInterprocess communication (IPC) plays a large role in the Mach component of the kernel. The Mach implementation of IPC relies on the notion of \"ports\".\nIn Mach IPC, ports are somewhat similar to TCP and UDP ports: in the same way that a process requires the TCP/UDP port of a resource on the network to be able to communicate with it, processes communicating over Mach IPC need to know the port of the desired service. This information is provided by the bootstrap server, which is one of the functions of the launchd process.\nSo, in this oversimplified analogy, the bootstrap server plays a role roughly equivalent to /etc/services.\nAs with the /etc/services file, the bootstrap server maintains a list of ports and names. You can get a list of them with launchctl print, just look for the endpoint array section, for example:\n\nport: 0x3e607\nname: com.apple.dock.server\n\nStretching the analogy, the difference between the services file and Mach IPC is that, while /etc/services is static, the list of ports and names the bootstrap server maintains is dynamic, as services can request to be added to it.\nAnd that brings us back to the original question: Bootstrap services are simply services registered with the bootstrap server.\nReferences\nIf you are interested in the macOS launch process, Mach IPC, launchd and its internals, you may find these references useful:\nSee Mach Bootstrap Basics and Mach Messaging and Mach Interprocess Communication (IPC) for more information on bootstrap basics and IPC.\nSee Kernel Architecture Overview for more information on the architecture of the macOS kernel.\nSee Mach Overview for an overview of the Mach component of the macOS kernel.\nSee Mac OS X For Unix Geeks and The Alpha and the Omega - launchd for an overview of the startup process in macOS.\nSee LAUNCHCTL 2.0 SYNTAX for a discussion about changes in the launchctl syntax.\nSee Mach Message and Bootstrap Server on OS X for an overview of Mach messaging and the bootstrap server.\nSee the source code of the bslist subcommand (look for bslist_cmd) for an insight on launchctl.

I don't think that there is hardware damage involved. How can I solve this issue?\n\nA: After restoring the system, the OS will need to rebuild the Spotlight index and other caches, so you will need to let it run for a while. If the high CPU still persists, then you will need to investigate.\nI would stay away from Intel Turbo Boost Switcher, as changing the default configuration of the hardware can make problems worse, or harder to diagnose. The same for fan management software. At most, you should test the configuration with Turbo Boost disabled, and then enable it again if there is no difference.\nIf you already had problems with your Mac freezing, then wiping and restoring exactly the same setup may just restore the problem, as well as everything else.\nAlways test one thing at a time, as that will allow you to pinpoint the cause.

The last 9 characters are all unique and not duplicated\n\nIf this is a one time thing and you just want to open Terminal to that folder, you can use the following compound command:\nfor f in *.[pP][dD][fF]; do mv -nv \"${f}\" \"$(n=\"${f%.*}\"; printf ${n: -9}).${f##*.}\"; done \n\nIt will act only on PDF files and rename to the last 9 characters. Note however, no error handling other then not overwriting an existing file.\n\nNote: The example bash script code is just that and does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted.\n\nA: If the files are in the same folder, go to Finder and select all the files you want to rename. Then right-click on them and one of the options is to rename xxx items where xxx is the number of files selected. When you select this option it opens a panel where you can enter how you want the files renamed. Then you can select rename and all the files will be renamed.\nOr from the command line use ls *.ext where ext is the extension of your file names, in your case pdf. If the ls command listed just the files you want to change the name of use cp *.ext newFileName.ext to copy the files to a new file name or use mv *.pdf NewFileName.pdfto move the files.\n\nA: Open Terminal and copy/paste the following code:\nfor f in *; do mv \"$f\" \"${f:19}\"; done\nThis will truncate the first 19 characters from the file names.\n", "Q: WiFi connection is weak after replacing the battery I replaced my MacBook Pro battery and everything was working fine. When I got home, I noticed that the WiFi doesn't connect easily in my room (it was working perfectly in my room before replacing the battery).\nWhen I move closer to the router, the WiFi connects quickly without any problems. Adding on that, I tried using my 3G connection from iPhone and it doesn't work (it connects, but no Internet).\nWhile replacing the battery, the guy cleaned the laptop from dust. Then, he has removed and connected the WiFi cable to clean below it.\nCould the issue be that the cable is not connected properly? Taking into consideration that I tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Date and time is correct\n\n*Location is correct\n\n*Renewed DHCP\n\nCan you please help?\nUpdate: 13 Aug\nI returned the laptop to the store and two of the cables were damaged. Since this can't be done without replacing the display, he suggested cutting cables from another Macbook pro display that they have in the store. He did that, and connected those cables with my laptop ones.\nIs that safe, long-lasting?  Will this actually work and be a reliable connection?\n\n\nA: \nWhile replacing the battery, the guy cleaned the laptop from dust. Then, he has removed and connected the WiFi cable to clean below it.\n\nI don't see why it would be necessary to remove the WiFi antennae cables to \"clean below it.\"  The nozzle (looks like a thin red drinking straw; below left) on those air dusters are thin enough to get into the smallest crevices of your computer.  However, if your tech is a \"pro,\" he should be using a proper air compressor with the right tool - technically called a a blow gun (below right).\n\n\n\n\nCould the issue be that the cable is not connected properly?\n\nOdds are, you've correctly identified the problem.\nResetting the SMC would have no effect as it's related to power and cooling of your Mac.  Things like your location, the date and DHCP have no bearing on signal strength - it's actually the opposite.  If your signal strength is too low, any/all of those services could fail.\n\nWhat to do next....\nReturn the laptop to the person who serviced it. Make sure you document the issue in email to him straight away as well.\nIf it's a simple mistake of not reconnecting the antennae (there can be 3 - one for Bluetooth and 2 for WiFi) then it will only take a moment to reconnect them.  However, if the antenna cable(s) and/or connector(s) are damaged, the antenna(e) will have to be replaced which means disassembling the display as the cables are routed behind the LCD panel (it's a difficult and risky job).\nI don't recommend you opening your MacBook and attempting the repair.  If the tech damaged something, you want to ensure that he \"owns\" the problem and not give him an \"out\" where he can say that because you opened it, you might have caused the damage.\nFrom your Update\nThat butt splice connections on the antennae is incorrect. Those are coaxial wires, not single conductor strands. There are two conductors - a single inner conductor and a conducting shield separated by a dielectric insulating material which is all \"covered\" by a protective outer jacket.  Your WiFi will never work correctly with that \"fix\".\nIf you look at the connectors themselves, you'll see they're not unlike the coax cables that provide you cable TV or the antenna on your WiFi router.  There's an inner socket surrounded by plastic and the outer conductive \"shell.\"\n\nThe bottom line is that repair is unacceptable and not going to work.  If replacing the display is what he has to do then that’s what has to be done. It’s an expensive lesson for him to learn, but so goes it when he decided to charge money for service he didn’t have the necessary skills to provide (my consumer protection side coming out).\nPersonally, I would let him know of the issue, follow that up with an email for documentation, then take to a qualified person to replace the display and present him with the bill.  Tell him nicely, at first, that he should replace it.  However, it could get messy.  I can't advise you what to do legally, but if I personally encountered resistance to make right what someone else botched, there would be legal action being taken.  I've personally taken people to small claims court over issues like this and prevailed.  Documentation is key.\n\nA: Indeed, as you said, it sounds like that either the cable is damaged or not connected properly.\nDoes your Bluetooth also work less reliable?\nI suggest you try plugging it in and out by yourself. Look for your MacBook model on iFixIt and check the teardown guides.\nIf this doesn't solve the issue, you might just order a new antenna.\n", "Q: Which part of the iPhone 8 Plus is this? I decided to repair my phone. I have succesfully disassembled and assembled it. But I got this part left on my table. Any ideas of what it is?\n\n\nA: That looks like the gasket holding the touch chip in place on the original screen assembly, fastened on the metal shield that you transfer from the original assembly to the new one. It is there because the touch chip needs to be in a very specific position to fit down in the phone when closing it. It is however not necessary for operation.\nAs for the ear speaker and light sensor not working, those are either the result of incorrect placement of the sensor and speaker contact as part of that assembly, when you transfer it from the old to the new screen assembly, or you have damaged the assembly itself, which is very easy to do when you are inexperienced, as it is a delicate part.\nThe home button part is also delicate and it is somewhat easy to rip its flex cable close to the contact when lifting it off the old screen assembly, which could give the symptoms you describe. Otherwise, try to reseat the contact.\n", "Q: change name in mac os terminal I just bought new macbook pro, and opened up my terminal .\nit shows:\n(base) Jiui-MacBookPro:~ myname$\nI want to change that \"Jiui\" part that is located in front of -MacBookPro.\nHow can I do that?

Basically I'd like to have one brightness setting configured for when I'm plugged in through the adapter and charging the macbook from wall power, vs a lower brightness setting when I'm running off battery to preserve battery life. This configuration swap would be in response to the changed power state of the laptop. Does MacOS support such behavior?\n\nA: While macOS does not support the exact behavior you are looking for (setting custom brightness when switching between power states), you can configure your Mac portable to slightly dim the brightness automatically when on battery power.\nTo do that, go to System Preferences → Energy Saver and enable Slightly dim the display while on battery power.\n\n", "Q: iCloud Drive keeps re-downloading a 40GB file I am running the macOS Big Sur Beta. Every little while, iCloud Drive will randomly start to download 50GB of files I don't need. I have a ~40GB zip file full of photos that I do not need stored on my laptop and this keeps downloading. This is wasting a lot of data. How can I fix this?\n\nA: There's nothing that appears to be 'fixed', based on the description in your question.\nThe purpose of iCloud is give you access to your data from any device logged-in with the same Apple ID. Using iCloud, you can access photos, files, contacts, Safari tabs, etc, just like they were part of your file system.  For example, if you create a doc using Pages on your Mac you can access and edit that same file from your iPad using the Pages app.\nIt looks like iCloud is simply syncing data between your devices at a regular interval.  This is normal, expected behavior.  You can control what's synced by going into your Apple ID via Settings on any logged-in device.\nIf you only want a backup solution, you can look into other services such as Dropbox and OneDrive.\n", "Q: How to add keyboard shortcut for 'move focus to next window' It's bound to ⌘+`.\nWhen I'm using the laptop's own keyboard it works fine,\nbut when I work with HHKB, ` is just too far off.

Each user account has an ID number (UID). The first-created user account is normally number 501, then next is 502, etc.\nIf Mac1 has account called \"Dave\", but has a UID of 502, then files saved on that Mac will be considered a different user account when used on account \"Dave\" #501 on Mac2. This will cause problems with file ownership and read/write access.\nAlso, bear in mind that if the OS can't find the user folder at boot, it will recreate a new empty account with that name in the default location.\n(If you're looking to sync files between two different Macs, there are better ways of doing it.)\n\nA: The answer is in general no. The usernames themselves are not used by the system for encoding permissions and ownership information. Instead each user is identified by a numeric ID number - and this is used when encoding permissions and ownership information on disk. A seperate translation step converts the ID to a username for display.\nIf you \"naively\" move across files from one computer to another - keeping the ID numbers the same - then it could be that it would be translated to different user names on the other computer. It all depends on the order the users are created in, so even if you have the same usernames on both computers - the IDs could be different.\nUsually you would ensure a global view of usernames/IDs across computers by joining them to some kind of directory. This is what is normally used in office setups, where you have a server with Apple's Open Directory, Microsoft's Active Directory, or similar LDAP service.\nYou can explore your own setup by opening the \"Directory Utility\" app on the Mac. In the \"Directory Editor\" tab, you'll be able to search for usernames and see in which directory they're stored (for example /Local/Default) and which attributes are stored about them. In particular look at the one called \"UniqueID\", which is the user's actual ID used for storing permissons and ownership information.\n", "Q: What causes excessive CPU use by taskgated, notifyd, and launchd processes? I've looked around a lot to try to find the answer to this but have thus far been unsuccessful.  I am programming in Python, and I have code that takes a long time to run (hours to months depending on the application) and I am trying to optimize it.  On larger thread systems (once I get above ≈8 threads, but especially >18 threads), I run into a situation where the system is using up a large amount of my CPU instead of the actual code I want to run.  On a 12-thread machine as I type this, the system is using ≈25–30% of my total CPU.  If I try to run it on a 36-thread machine, the system takes >70% of the CPU which is simply unworkable (though running two instances of the code, limiting each to 18 threads, cuts this overhead back, oddly enough).\nThe Activity Monitor indicates that taskgated is using at least 10%, while notifyd, logd, and launchd are also using several percent, each (along with mds at 1% so I should turn off Spotlight, and sometimes lsd spikes to >40%, but that's more rare ... note that that process is another launch system daemon).\nMy older hypothesis was that it was a disk I/O issue, since the code was writing and reading many small files to try to keep track of certain things and recover if I needed to stop it.\nMy now-working hypothesis, based on what I could find online about the interactions between taskgated and launchd, is that this particular chunk of code is spawning a large number of processes and macOS's launching and security daemons are taking large amounts of CPU to make sure those processes are safe.  These are things like calling \"mv\" and \"rm\" from the command line (os.system(...) in my Python code), and spawning other code that take a second or two to run (such as in a different conda environment when two have conflicting installs of necessary components).  I count at least 40 potential spots where this chunk of code is possibly spawning child processes, and I thread it so that it's doing that concurrently however many threads there are (so, on a 12-thread machine, 12x40 over the course of ~10 seconds).  It doesn't seem to me like this should be making my system take up so much CPU, but that's my best guess at the moment.\nPossibly related, the taskgated is constantly spitting out to log files, \"MacOS error: -67062\", which again I've searched for and found no luck with diagnosing the issue.  And, diskarbitrationd is spawning a lot of \"<private>\" messages in the Console, but its CPU% is around 0.3% so I'm less concerned about that.\nMy apologies for rambling a bit here, but I'm trying to provide the information I have, and hopefully someone here has an idea.  If I can get rid of this 25% or larger issue, that can save months of time.\nFor what it's worth, I'm running macOS 10.14.5 and ..4 on two desktops, and 10.15.5 on a laptop.  Same issue for all.  Running in Linux on a nearly identical 36-thread system build does not have the overhead issue (but I really don't want to switch to Linux) which is another reason why I don't think it's a disk I/O problem.\n\nA: Is your question to understand macOS better or have your Python code complete faster? I suspect the latter.\nIf so, have you profiled your Python code? What does the performance profile show?\nmacOS\ntaskgated and launchd are both involved in evaluating and launching processes.\nTurn on macOS's server performance mode for raised resource limits.\nIf a lack of code signing is a suspected cause, you can ad-hoc code sign your – and others' binaries:\nsudo codesign -f -s - <full path to bundle or executable>\n\nExternal Processes\n\nThe spawned processes range in longevity, it's anything from a simple \"mv\" terminal command to running another program that can take seconds to hours, though most are on the shorter side.\n\nOn any operating system, avoid calling out to external processes when an in-language call exists. Launching a process and waiting for the process to terminate is expensive, compared to a system call.\nSee Python - How to move a file? to replace mv with os.rename(), shutil.move(), or os.replace().\nThreads\nAdding threads to your process will not guarantee that calls down into the operating system will not be queued and handled sequentially.\nThreads in Python are posix threads and thus managed by the operating system. Adding threads gives the underlying operating system more work and more influence on how your process performs. In this regard, the difference between Linux and macOS is significant.\nUse threads to handle data manipulation and, where possible, pass off file handling work to a dedicated file handling thread. Avoid touching the disk unless absolutely essential to continue the next task. Even then, try and pass data to and from other processes using pipes or inter-process communication (IPC).\nUse a solid state drives (SSDs) instead of spinning hard disk drives (HDDs).\nLinux\nGiven you appear to have proven Linux is faster than macOS, use Linux.\nDocker\nTo save months, I would justify 1 - 2 days experimenting with Docker. This approach will allow you to run a light weight instance of Linux on your Mac and avoid the proven costs of macOS. This should ease the cost of spawning processes.\nThere will be an unfortunate learning curve to Docker but it will be time well spent.\nUsing Docker will give you a well defined working environment that can be started, stopped, and replicated without ties to the host operating system.\nUnavoidable?\nBe wary of assuming the 20-25% of system time is not useful, and is avoidable. macOS is a heavy operating system compared to Linux. High Performance Computing uses specific operating systems for a reason. If using Linux is easy and gets the results faster, sinking time into macOS appears unjustifiable.\n\nA: I think the overhead you are getting with the daemons you are referring to are unavoidable on macOS. For example, launchd is the main process for launching applications and ensures that the processes it launched are kept alive if instructed so. Using more threads on macOS is a well known issue concerning a higher overhead for the kernel. This is why Apple documentation clearly states that you should use them judiciously and sparingly. Moreover, it seems as though macOS is not trusting your script, as is an unsigned “executable” and the error you are getting corresponds to:\n\nsecurity error -67062\nError: 0xFFFEFA0A -67062 code object is not signed at all\n\nThus, the extra overhead you are seeing is most probably due to Gatekeeper, which is constantly checking what your script is spawning and doing.\nPossible (partial) solutions to your problem:\n\n*\n\n*Embed your python script in a signed app - this is what Apple recommends in the  technical note TN2206.\n\n*Use Linux instead\n\n", "Q: How to crash an application to produce Crash Report I want to crash an application in order to produce the crash report and view it in Console.app. However, running sudo kill <pid> or sudo kill -9 <pid> closes the application but does not produce the Crash Report.

All Google searches containing \"mac\", \"app\", and \"crash\" are about solutions to preventing apps from crashing.\n\nA: It turns out that sending SIGKILL (kill -9) to an application is a bit too abrupt, the same goes for SIGTERM (kill -15). Instead, sending SIGQUIT (kill -3) worked, and SIGABRT (kill -6). The application I killed was Activity Monitor, but it should work with other macOS applications as well (The real macOS ones, that ship with OS, Console works and Safari as well). You just need to wait a couple of seconds if the application killed had big memory footprint, because it takes some time to produce the Crash Report.\n", "Q: Siri freezes on screen when opening This issue occurred when i said launch finder, 2 seconds later it froze permanently on the screen.

I am using iOS 14.\n\nA: It seems like this should work, but it doesn't. If you enter airplane mode while connected to Ethernet and attempt a call, you will receive this message:\n\"No Network Connection. Connect to a Wi-Fi network or disable airplane mode to place a call.\"\nIf you're on Verizon, a usable workaround is to download the Verizon Message+ iOS app. You can enable Calling within the app and it works to make and receive calls on your normal number. Texting also works, but it's standard SMS (no iMessage). Caveats: The app is meant for handling calls from another device and will tell you calling won't work properly on your primary device. This is normally true, but those problems are nullified while in airplane mode. Additionally, it will complain that WiFi is turned off, but happily works anyway with Ethernet.\nOne more note: iMessage through the Apple Message app should function in theory, but it doesn't work quite right. I can sometimes receive iMessages there, but not send.\n\nA: Was having similar trouble with iMessage and Facetime with an iPad using an Ethernet adapter.   Turned off Airplane Mode, manually turned off WiFi and Bluetooth, and Facetime and iMessage started to work normally.  Using iOS 15.3.

Among them there is a partition, say, Partition 1 of 500GB. There is another partition, say, Partition 2 of 20GB. I want to get 100GB of Partition 1 and add it to Partition 2. How can I do that? Both the partitions contain data, (partition 1 has around 100GB of data only), so I can't erase them and make them again. Is there any way to do it?\n\nA: The answer is no. This answer assumes the partitions are in chronological order. This is one of the problems which was solved by APFS. With APFS, more than one APFS volume can reside in a partition and the volumes can share the space.\nIn your case, you would need to shrink the a partition by 100 GB. There a tools provided by Apple or third parties that can shrink the volume(s) stored in a partition. The partition can then be set to a smaller size, thus creating free space below the partition. However, adding the free space to the next partition usually requires first moving the partition up by 100 GB. This can not be done by using the Disk Utility. Once the partition is relocated, then depending on the volume format either the Disk Utility or a third party tool may be able to enlarge the partition and containing volumes(s) to contain the free space.\nBefore attempting to move a partition, a backup of the partition should be made. However, once a backup is made, generally moving the partition becomes unnecessary. An alternative would be to delete the partition and created a new partition of the required size, then reloading the partition from the backup.\n", "Q: How do I transfer all the contents of a file based on a criteria to another folder? \nI have multiple folders i.e., Fold1_part1 which have 6 subdirectories in them.

It tracks at the exact same speed:\n\nIt appears to remember the setting and it makes defaults read -g com.apple.mouse.scaling return different results, but the actual mouse tracking speed never changes. Is there any way to debug this? I'm using MacOS 10.15.6.\n\nA: Ah I just figured it out! I was using a KVM with a \"fast switching mode\" where you can hit the side of the screen with your mouse twice to switch inputs. Somehow this got turned on. (It also explains why it was randomly switching inputs without me asking!)\nAs soon as you turn it off (Scroll lock, Scroll lock, F12 for the one I'm using), the mouse works perfectly again. My guess is that in order to know when you hit the side of the screen, the KVM has to be in charge of the position of the cursor on the screen, so it must set the mouse to absolute mode, and then the OS sensitivity has no effect.\nWould be nice if something in the UI said the mouse is operating in absolute mode (I didn't even know that was possible, though I guess graphics tablets use it).\n", "Q: iMac shut down due to power outage; started working after a few hours I am using an iMac which got shutdown due to sudden power cut. Once the power came back it wasn't starting up.  However, when I tried again after few hours it started.\nCan anyone please tell me what actually happening at hardware level due the power suddenly being gone and how it started working after a period of time doing an NVRAM or SMC reset or without doing anything?\n\nA: \nOnce power came it is not starting but when I tried after few hours it started.\n\nSwitching power supplies have a re-settable fuse that will trip if there is a power surge and reset itself after some time or if you remove the power cord and hold the power button to dissipate any remaining charge in the circuits.  So, the symptoms you describe are very much in line with how these circuits work.  They cut off current for a period of time and then reset themselves so your power supply works again.\nWhen you have a power outage, it is very common for the power to come back with a power surge (also known as a voltage spike).  This fuse is built into the power supply to protect it from surges like this.\nThat said, I wouldn't depend on it as it's not designed to absorb higher spikes like those that come from lightning strikes - get a quality power surge protector (not a power strip, but an actual surge protector (they are significantly more expensive than a power strip).\nResetting the NVRAM or SMC will not have any effect.  The NVRAM only holds pre-boot environment variables and the SMC doesn't control this fuse.  For the SMC to function, you need to have power (3 VDC), if the power was cut off (like the fuse did), the SMC is in an off state and won't respond to anything.\n\nA: When the power goes off, then everything stops immediately.\nThe problem with happening is a 'normal' shutdown takes time. Applications and the OS need to save files, and 'put things away' cleanly. If you have a mechanical hard drive, then suddenly stopping it means it won't have time to park the drive head (like putting the needle of a record player on its rest).\nIt's possible that a power shut-off can 'stress' various components.\nThere's no reason I can think of why the iMac shouldn't restart normally as soon as power is restored. You're sure power was restored, and all fuses or circuit-breakers were back in the \"ON\" position?\nThe occasional power cut shouldn't do any damage; but each one might increase some component failure. Also, having an unreliable supply may affect the lifespan of the internals.\n", "Q: How to access locked notes with forgotten password? I've forgotten my Notes.app password and the hint I left myself is no help. I have the ability to reset the password in Settings, but all my old notes that used the old password would remain locked. Is there any way that I can access these locked notes? I'm thinking of the sort of program that tries different different combinations of characters until it figures out the password like you would see in a hacking movie if that's real. \n\nA: Hollywood does not have a great track record in accurately portraying technology.\nThe whole point of passwords and encryption is to make it as difficult as possible (if not impossible) to get in without the password.\nLet's say your password was 8 letters long. Using 26 lower-case letters only, the number of combinations is over 200 billion, so trying each password in turn at 1 second each would take 6,500 years.\nYour best bet is to think long and hard about the hint, and what you might have meant.\n", "Q: Sharing screen snippets from Windows 10 to iPad 7 Is there a good way to share screen snippets taken with Windows⇧ ShiftS to an iPad?\nWindow's cloud clipboard requires Microsoft launcher.\n\nA: As far as the individual manufacturers go (Apple and Microsoft), their universal clipboards are for products in their eco system.  In other words, Apple's universal clipboard only works between Apple devices (i.e. macOS to iOS).  Same with Microsoft.\nHowever, you have a couple of options:\n\n*\n\n*Save your snipit to a file and save that file to a cloud service like OneDrive or iCloud.  There are Microsoft OneDrive clients for macOS and iOS and reciprocally there are iCloud clients for Windows.\n\n\n*Use a 3rd party utility like 1Clipboard that will allow you to sync a clipboard between Windows and macOS (requires Google drive)\nPersonally, I use the first option and simply save any image I obtain from my Windows machine to a OneDrive folder and pick it up on my Mac through the OneDrive folder there.  The clipboard could be more convenient but I'm not keen on having Google products installed, but if it's something you already use then it's an easy integration.\n", "Q: How to get folder path in Automator Folder Action? How do I get a path (or a name) of the folder an Automator Folder Action is attached to and save it into a variable?\nMy folder action is attached to Downloads, I copy newly dropped files into a temporary folder, process them and want to move them back into Downloads. I don't want to use hardcoded value with Move Finder Items as the folder action may be attached to different folders. Instead, I need folder action to be smart enough to move items back to the folder it is attached to.\n\nA: I don't think you can get the folder an action is attached to, but I think a good analog would be to get the parent folder of the current file. So, the parent folder of a file in ~/Downloads/MyDownloadedFile.pdf will be the Downloads folder, and you could save that to a variable.\nThis action is not built in to Automator. However, if you are running macOS 10.13 or earlier, you can purchase a package of third-party Automator Actions from http://automatedwork.server323.com/products/apps/automator-actions-for-mac-os-x-10-610-7-snow-leopard-lion/. The action you want is \"Get Parent Folders of Finder Items\" in the \"File and Folder Automator Action Pack\". At the time that I bought it (a few months ago), the developer charged $20.\n\n(You may also be able to accomplish this without third party actions by using an Applescript block—something like tell application \"Finder\" to return container of (input as alias). However, when I tried this myself, Automator seemed unable to save the variable properly. I'm not sure if that's due to a limitation of Automator or a problem with my Applescript.)\n", "Q: How to set default directory for Emacs 27.1 app? I just upgraded Emacs to 27.1 using brew cask. One noticeable change is that when I launch the app and c-x c-f the directory is / instead of ~/.\nThis really bothers me, is there a way to change it back?\n\nA: I have worked around this issue by editing /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs, inserting\nDir.chdir(ENV['HOME'])\n\nbefore the call to exec at line 69\nexec [emacs[:exe], emacs[:exe]], *ARGV \n\nThis is obviously just a temporary workaround, but it restores the previous behaviour of Emacs 26 without modifying any of my configuration or affecting Emacs command line calls, since it only modifies the Finder launch.\nI've also posted this at https://github.com/caldwell/build-emacs/issues/98#issuecomment-720609277 EDIT: “Looks like the fix will be in 27.2.” https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=44446#11\n\nA: Following the lead of @rptb1 , I modified /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs, inserting\n  if ENV['PWD']\n    Dir.chdir(ENV['PWD'])\n  else\n    Dir.chdir(ENV['HOME'])\n  end\n\nbefore the call to exec:\nexec [emacs[:exe], emacs[:exe]], *ARGV \n\nThe advantage of this over the previous answer is that if you start emacs with the open command, you'll get the current working directory, which is normally what you'd expect, instead of your home directory.  This is critical for me because I often use the command-line to open a file in the current directory.\nAlthough this is mostly a duplicate of his answer, I am posting it as a new answer because my comment on his answer came out so badly formatted.  I hope the upcoming bug fix preserves the current directory, as emacs 26 did.\n\nA: I had the same issue after installing Emacs 27.1, my default directory became \"/\"\nI could fix it by adding the following to my .emacs file.\n(setq default-directory \"~/\")\n(setq command-line-default-directory \"~/\")\n\n", "Q: Google Drive File Stream folders are missing I am using Google Drive File Stream and have a problem where some of the folders are missing from a team drive/shared drive.

I also hate that large numbers of folders randomly disappear. I'm in a pissing match with Google support over this right now. They insist this is a fix, but it is becoming a widespread issue in our enterprise.\nI updated to Google Drive for Desktop today to get 50.0.5.0, a computer reboot was needed to get the Finder integration options working so that “Refresh Folders” was an option.\n\nA: As of today, this software has been renamed to be Google Drive for desktop\nIf you choose to stream files, the old folder will be still there but you will have a cloud drive with all the files there as well.\nYou have to make sure you access the cloud drive that is actually synced by the new Google drive\n\n*\n\n*Click the app icon and then the gear\n\n\n\n\n*Select \"Preferences\"\n\n\n\n\n*Press \"Google Drive\" tab and then \"Open in Finder\" on the right\n\n\n\n\n*You will notice that the new window it opened has a Google Drive logo on top.

Edit: I'm talking about scissor-type - and butterfly is worse, in my opinion.\nIn general, I feel that the keyboard of Mac (or here my main focus is actually MBP) is too stiff. Because I'm too weak, when I keep typing my fingers eventually start hurting.\nThis is the only reason why I keep using XPS, whose keys are very easy to type.\nBut because I want to completely switch to Mac, I'm looking for a way to make MBP's key looser, that is, less stiff. Is there anybody who has this kind of experience, or any successful result? I'm thinking like, for example, taking the key cover off the board and tweaking the spring(?) to make it weak or somethinkg like that.\n\nA: \nI feel that the keyboard of Mac (or here my main focus is actually MBP) is too stiff.\n\nThere is no reasonable way you can change the stiffness of a MacBooks keyboard. However depending on the model of the MacBook, the tactile feedback could differ. While the keyboard typing feel could argued to be subjective, a general perception is that the new Butterfly keyboards introduced in Late 2019 16\" MacBook Pro and then eventually in the newer 2020 13\" MacBook Pro and 2020 MacBook Air are easier to type on.\nSo if you are using one of the older MacBooks, you can consider buying a new one after you give the new Butterfly keyboard a try in a store.\nAlternatively, you can also consider getting an external keyboard where you pick one as per your exact liking.\n\nA: Attempting to modify any MacBook keyboard is a costly mistake in my opinion and experience. Do anything but this.\n\n*\n\n*Run a Dell / HP / Microsoft and remote in for occasional macOS use\n\n*Run an external keyboard if you need macOS - bluetooth is very good now, as is wired\ncompatibility\n\n*Get a Chromebook\n\nWhen you break the scissors or butterfly, spare parts are expensive or low fidelity. Topcase repair is costly as batteries are integral and you can’t really get to the bottom of the keyboard without destroying your battery that also is expensive or low fidelity third party options when damaged.\nTry to figure if you can let go of disappointment and enjoy a Mac or you have to take a stand and avoid Apple. I believe that changing the nature of the keyboard will be harder and less productive than changing your requirements or expectations.\n\nA: Might it be the case that you're actually hitting the keys too hard, and that is what is causing your fingers to hurt? The required downward force is very little, and it may just take a little while to accustom yourself to it.\n", "Q: Can‘t update any iOS Apps: “If you have an Apple ID, sign in with it here“ Edit: I did a factory reset and it worked.

What steps might I be missing?\n\nA: While Big Sur has been relased as a public beta, it's not ready for general consumption.  It's going to have issues and users are expected to know how to get around issues and at least research.  Let's face it... you're jumping into the deep end of the pool - do you know how to swim or at least did you bring your floaties?\nFrom the Beta FAQ\n\nPlease note that since the public beta software has not yet been commercially released by Apple, it may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not function as well as commercially released software. Be sure to back up your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and your Mac using Time Machine before installing beta software. Since Apple TV purchases and data are stored in the cloud, there’s no need to back up your Apple TV. Install the beta software only on non-production devices that are not business critical. We strongly recommend installing on a secondary system or device, or on a secondary partition on your Mac.\n\nI'm not saying this to discourage you, in fact, I encourage all users to try out new things because it expands their skill set.  However, I do fear for users who want to upgrade to the bleeding edge on their only computer to beta software (regardless if it's Windows, macOS, or even a *nix) without having some sort of way to escape if something goes sideways.  Ask any long time user here how many questions we each have answered where having a Time Machine backup would solve pretty much all problems...\nAll that said...

When using cmd + shift + 5 to screen record, there is only one option present for sound (Macbook Pro microphone). This captures the 'computer' audio, but it also records unwanted noise in the physical environment.\nTo reduce/remove the background noise, I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences -> Sound -> Input -> MacBook Pro Microphone -> Input volume to zero. This does indeed prevent background noise from the microphone being recorded, but also causes the screen recording to record without any audio, that is, it fails to capture the 'computer audio' (for lack of a better term)\n\n*Opening Audio MIDI Setup -> MacBook Pro Microphone -> 'Mute'. But this has the same effect as the previous attempt (no sound from the microphone, but also no sound from the computer).\n\n*As a temporary fix, searching for where the microphone is in the hope of placing something physical over it.\n\nIs there any way to disable the microphone entirely so the 'computer' audio records but without any background noise?\n\nA: Before you begin to record, go to System Preferences > Sound > Input. Make sure the input source selected is \"Internal Microphone.\" Then move the slider (\"Input Volume\") to the left to reduce the input volume.\n\nA: Could you screen record using QuickTime? There's an option in QuickTime to screen record and use an external microphone (i.e. not the MacBook internal mic). Just open QuickTime and click in the menubar File > New Screen Recording.

I don't remember the previous release of MacOS it was running with. It has a 3.2GHz i3, 1T HDD and 12G of RAM.\nIt's incredibly sluggish, clicking or typing will often result in the spinning wheel for a few seconds before anything happens. I've installed nothing on it beyond what High Sierra does by default.\nMy intention for this Mac is to use is for web browsing, writing, watching videos and music creation (with Garageband or other DAW).I have no intention of changing the HDD to an SSD - I don't think it's worth the cost and I have 2019 iMac that I have access to. This is just a secondary computer I'd like to have in my house.\nWould an older release of MacOS fix this sluggishness? What release of MacOS would you recommend?\n\nA: I have the 27\" Mid-2010 iMac with High Sierra. Mine is sluggish as well but not as bad as you say yours is. My internal Fusion drive is dying and that, I believe, is why mine is so sluggish. I've had High Sierra for a long time and never experienced a problem with it. It ran fine until my drive started failing. Since you still have your original drive you may want to check its status. I use Drive DX to get the SMART status of my drives.\nYou may want to run EtreCheck Pro which will tell you if your machine is sluggish and possible causes and solutions. EtreCheck Pro on my machine tells me its too sluggish to be caused by software and it's probably due to a failing drive.\n\nA: I would plug in an external SSD - those machines continue to run as fast at work as they were the day we purchased them with one exception: storage degradation\n\n*\n\n*Fusion drives are likely done with fast writes unless you have it powered off got 8 of the 10 years it served you.\n\n*HDD at 10 years are just going to need an erase and probably retirement, anyhow.\n\nGet an SSD or external drive over thunderbolt or FireWire and install the newest OS it can run. Then migrate all apps, settings, data you care to get off the internal drive and then erase the internal drive so you don't see it as a drive on the desktop is my advice.\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically save Pages documents copies as PDF on every save? Is there a way to enable Pages (version 10.1 (6913)) to automatically save a copy of the current document as PDF every time I save it to avoid a manual export?\n\nA: You might be able to use Folder Actions to trigger an AppleScript that creates the  PDF whenever the contents of the folder are changed. The problem may be the fact that the document is still open.\nBut realistically, you don't have to manually press Save in Pages anyway, so just assign a key command to Export to PDF.

I spoke to two Apple Geniuses (head supervisors). No one could explain why this was happening. But I decided to wipe the drive, reformat the disk, and put everything back on it.\n", "Q: Word problem with Adobe Garamond Pro I'm having a mysterious problem with Word (version 16.40) and the Adobe Garamond Pro font: Four variants of the font are installed (regular, italic, bold, and bold italic), but if I select regular, Word instead uses bold. It's as if the program can't see the regular (and regular italic) styles, except that Word itself lists all four styles in the font menu and displays the name of the font using the regular variant. It's just in the text that it's misbehaving.\nNo other app seems to have this problem, and Font Book reports no problems with the font. This behavior appeared only recently, as it was noticed first today in a file that uses the font and was last edited without problem on Aug 3.\nThe same problem appears with Adobe Caslon Pro.\nI've tried clearing the system font caches and Word's font cache. I've tried disabling and re-enabling the font. I've restored a previous version of Word from Time Machine. None of these has had any effect. Other similar fonts work fine, for example, Garamond Premier Pro.\nI have several files very carefully formatted using Adobe Garamond Pro, so I'm not eager to change the font to something that's working properly, then have to redo the formatting. Has anyone seen a problem like this and found a solution?\nEdited to add: This is under macOS 10.15.5.\nAdded 8/13/20: I've now tested with a new account, but it's not revealing much, at least to me. In a brand new account, the first time I run Word the fonts are just fine. If I quit and reenter Word, the problem reappears — Adobe Garamond Pro appears only in bold and bold italic.\nAnother curious thing: The font menu that appears under Format->Font (rather than the one that appears in the ribbon) shows \"Adobe Garamond Pro\" as a choice the first time Word is run, but after that shows \"Adobe Garamond Pro Bold\" instead. It also, from the second time on, has a number of font names appearing in all upper case.\nIf I had to guess, the first time it's run Word reads in all the font data from the system correctly. When quit (or sometime before that) it writes that data to disk, but when it reads that data in subsequently, something goes wrong. However, I haven't been able to find where that info is being written, if that's what's actually happening. It feels like I'm trying to debug MS's app for them...\n\nA: It's fixed. The culprit appears to have been Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and was fixed with a recent update (version 2020.12.20043). You may have to quit Word and restart it, you possibly have to run Reader once before the fonts work again.\nNot my observation, but taken from a discussion at a Microsoft board. Thanks to H. Tomás Gómez-Arostegui for pointing me to his thread there.\n\nA: I have Word v 16.16 and I don't see this issue on Mojave. Adobe Caslon Pro and Adobe Garamond Pro both work as expected. I can select Regular and Bold variants.\nWord does treat fonts in its own special way, of course.\nPresumably this is a new behaviour that didn't used to happen? I would test the behaviour with an existing document in a new user account. If the fonts behave there, then you know it's some issue in your user Library. Go back to the original account, and test removing things, such as Word's preference files, application caches, etc.\n", "Q: Listing all applications that are actively listening through audio inputs I would like to know if there is any way to use terminal to list all active applications that are listening to audio devices (built in microphones, usb mics, etc) via terminal.

I know that this is possible, because applications similar to OverSight are able to monitor and give real-time information regarding audio usage.\n\nA: Closest I can do for tonight is (using ggrep from brew install coreutils) getting pids of processes requesting the microphone (which appears to be how OverSight does it):\nlog show \\\n --info \\\n --predicate \\\n \"process == 'coreaudiod' && category == 'access'\" |\n grep kTCCServiceMicrophone |\n ggrep -o -P 'pid\\:\\K[0-9]+'\n\nThis will return something like\n82931\n83353\n83496\n83856\n83856\n\nUnfortunately, it's not clear how to get process names/ paths; the obvious ps -p <pid> yields nothing. They use some arcane method in OverSight to apparently work around this, but I'm unable to divine how to do this via CLI.\n", "Q: Why different Bluetooth headsets pair in different ways on iPhone? I used to pair my Bluetooth headset to my iPhone in the \"standard\" way using the Settings app. The pairing goes like the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings → Bluetooth, and turn on the headset:\n\n\n\n*Wait for the headset to appear, and tap on its button:\n\n\n\n*The headset is connected:\n\nRecently I got a new Bluetooth headset, and I found that it pairs in a different way, which goes like the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings → Bluetooth, turn on the headset, and a \"Bluetooth Pairing Request\" dialog pops up automatically:\n\n\n\n*Tap on the \"Pair\" button, and the headset is connected:\n\nI think the second way of pairing is a little more convenient. What makes the pairing procedures for the two headsets different? Is the new headset using some kind of advanced Bluetooth technology?\n\nA: \nWhat makes the pairing procedures for the two headsets different?\n\nQuite simply, the Bluetooth version is what determined the pairing capabilities.\n\nIs the new headset using some kind of advanced Bluetooth technology?\n\nIn short, yes.  That Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds are Bluetooth 5 compliant and if you’re using an iPhone 8 or newer, it’s also utilizing Bluetooth 5.\nSo why the difference?  Basically the protocol it uses to advertise its services. Bluetooth 5 supports LE (low energy) extended advertisements.  Basically, when close enough, the device will advertise to a discoverable device like your phone “I’m a headset.  Would you like to pair?”  Which is why it seems so simple.\nIt gets even easier when you utilize NFC in which you actually “touch” the devices together and the Bluetooth connection manager assumes you want to connect so it just looks for a confirmation To pair - yes or no.\nI couldn’t find specifications for the Xround Versa because their website is quite limited, but I would guess that it uses Bluetooth 4.0 or even earlier resulting in the different experience.\n", "Q: MacOS Catalina, Disk Utility: \"Unable to perform deferred repairs\" Upon running Disk Utility against `Macintosh HD - Data\", I get the following towards the end of the check:\nerror: dstream (id 8753874978) does not have an associated dstream id object\nVerifying allocated space.\nPerforming deferred repairs.\nerror: Unable to perform deferred repairs without full space verification\nerror: Try running fsck against the entire APFS container instead of a volume\nThe volume /dev/rdisk1s1 could not be verified completely.\nFile system check exit code is 0.\nRestoring the original state found as mounted.\n\nI've booted into Single User mode, but running fsck -fy tells me that it cannot be run because the /dev/rdisk1s1 drive is mounted in write mode.

This will seem like a duplicate issue, but stick with me and you'll see something odd is going on.\nTDLR; Fixed missing/undetected boot drive issue with new SSD and SATA cable, or so I thought. The issue still persists, but I've discovered it only happens when the MacBook Pro is left shut off for more than ~5 minutes! If I shutdown, then reboot within a few seconds or 2-3 minutes it works. If I leave it much longer the boot fails with the folder and question mark icon!\nThis MacBook Pro has the \"question mark on folder\" boot issue - here's a picture. This usually indicates a corrupt/failed boot drive or faulty SATA cable. I had the same issue on my own 2012 MacBook Pro a few years ago, and did the same repair (replace the cable and SSD upgrade) so I thought it would be easy.\nThe repair went smoothly. I got High Sierra installed on the new SSD by creating a bootable USB. Rebooted a few times afterwards to confirm all was well and considered it a job well done.\nUnfortunately, when I tried to boot the MacBook Pro later in the day it displayed the error again on boot! I performed an SMC and PRAM reset and then it booted up. I assumed all was well.\nI decided to verify my work a little later, and it failed to boot again!\nIt seems as though the issue occurs if the MacBook is left sitting without power for a while. If I leave it sit on the boot failure screen for a few minutes, then reboot, all is fine. I assume the original issue was never the old HDD or SATA cable, but something power related maybe?\nI appreciate any ideas you have.\n\nA: This sounds like a failing NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) chip - it's not holding the boot values.\nWhen you do an NVRAM reset, it clears the pre-boot environment forcing your Mac to search for bootable volumes which it then writes to NVRAM.  After you shut it off, power is removed from the NVRAM chip and as the voltage dissipates, it loses or corrupts the contents of it's memory.  It could be the chip itself or the associated circuitry that supports it - without putting hands on, it's impossible to know.\nYou have to take it in for service.  There are board level repair shops that can replace the actual chip(s), or you may need to replace the entire logic board.\n", "Q: Can you listen to music using AirPods without an Internet connection?

Is it safe to give those apps \"Full Disk Access\". Should I turn SIP off and on again? (What does that do anyway?)\n\nCatalina has instituted a new security model in which applications or processes need to be granted rights to different resources.  It has nothing to do with your rights per se, but rights of the resource. For instance, you might not want your Firefox to have rights outside it’s normal work folders.  On the past, an attacker might exploit some flaw and gain access to other directories snd drop off malicious code. Now, if the app doesn’t have rights to accessed the volume, it won’t be able to access it regardless whether of your rights\nSIP is merely a set of protected folders. what makes it special is that it cannot be disabled while the file system is mounted which is why you need to reboot in Recovery/Single User mode to disable it.

How do I determine what version of Bluetooth my iPhone supports (4.2, 5, etc.)?\nIs it determined by my hardware (such as iPhone SE)? Or is it all in the OS version (such as mine that's iOS 13.5.1)? What Bluetooth version do these values map to?\n\nA: You can search for your iPhone's technical specifications page by model name (like \"iPhone SE\") on the apple support site. However, make sure you know what generation you are interested in, if that's a thing with your model. I searched for \"iphone se technical specifications\" on both the support site and the main Apple site and one site gave me info on 1st gen SE, the other on 2nd gen SE (both labelled \"iPhone SE\").\nThe resulting spec page has info about the Bluetooth version supported, so I suppose it is determined by the hardware and not on the iOS version.\nUPDATE:\nIt seems you can find a spec page containing bluetooth information on https://everymac.com by searching for the model number \"MP8K2LL/A\" as well.\n\nA: Bluetooth Capabilities\n\nWhat Bluetooth version do these values map to?\n\nYour Bluetooth chip is actually part of the larger wireless chip inside your phone.  It could be integrated with the Broadcom or Qualcomm radios or it could be a separate WiFi and Bluetooth module much like the AirPort cards found in Mac computers.\nThose versions \"map to\" the capabilities of the Bluetooth functionality of that chipset.  As far as your OS is concerned (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, etc.) it can only make use of what the chip provides.  A manufacturer can choose to not enable NFC pairing for example, even though it's part of the Bluetooth 5 standard.  The operating system cannot \"upgrade\" Bluetooth functionality in the same manner that filling your car with ultra high octane racing gas can suddenly make it a contender for the 24 hours at Sebring.\nSo, to answer your question....\n\nIs it determined by my hardware (such as iPhone SE)?\n\nYes, but not just your hardware.  It also depends on what features that the Bluetooth hardware is capable of that Apple makes available in their operating system (i.e NFC or Near Field Communications)\nHow to find the technical specifications\nApple maintains a database of the technical specifications for all of it's products at https://support.apple.com/specs.  Every product they make is archived here - I checked for the original iPhone and sure enough, it was available.\n\nThe Bluetooth information is usually found under the Cellular and wireless section as shown below:\n\n\nA: You can get the model number of your device by going to Settings-General-About and then type into google the model number iPad Bluetooth version and it will display pages that have the information. As an example, I have an iPad Pro with model number MPA42LL/A. I typed the following into Google search box:\niPad MPA42ll/A BlueTooth version    \n\nAnd I got about 4 sites that told me directly the Bluetooth version.  It also gives you the generation and name of the iPad.\nIf you just type in the model number only into Google, you'll get info on that version of Apple Product.\nThe Bluetooth depends on the hardware, not the System Software.\n", "Q: Why does Python keep popping up and occupying my CPU? I occasionally get Python popping up and occupies all my CPU\n\nI have no clue why this is happening, because I almost never run Python on my laptop.\n\nHere is an update on December 9, 2020\nI think the issue comes from a VS code extension called \"Python\", and you can check out the corresponding issue in its Github page.\n\nA: Python with a capital P is the launcher app, found at /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app\nThis is used when a python script uses MacOS GUI components, such as creating a window, dialog or file panel.\nIt's likely that some process is calling a python script to do something.

Normally, this type of question would be closed because it's opinionated, but in this instance, I think a preponderance of people would resoundingly say \"no, that model Mac is not appropriate for that type of work.\"\nSo, instead of providing you an opinionated answer on what I think would be best, instead, I'm going to provide you with the salient points you need to consider when selecting a computer to fit your work - in this case video editing.\n\nThis workflow is hard on a computer; it's resource hungry.  The less resources you give it, the less efficient you'll be and the more frustrated you'll become.  Editing video requires lots of CPU, lots of GPU, tons of memory and storage (scratch space as well as archival).\nCPU\nMore is better.  However, there's only so much CPU you can dump into a laptop form factor before you hit the wall in terms of diminishing returns.  What do I mean by that?  Faster CPU = more heat.  Heat is detrimental to a CPU so cooling is paramount and laptops are horrible at it. So, macOS with throttle your CPU to keep it cool but that ends up being CPU power you paid for that you can't use.  It's like buying a V8 but it throttles down to the power of a 4 cylinder to keep it cool.  So, more is good, too much (in a laptop) is a waste.\nMemory\nIn video editing you can't have enough memory.  Get as much as you can.  32GB should be your minimum.  Nobody has ever uttered the words, \"Gee, I wish I had less memory.\"  You might find that 64GB or even 96GB or 128GB of RAM is what you need, depending on the videos you're creating.\nGPU\nAll MacBook Air models comes with integrated graphics meaning it doesn't actually have a GPU.  This is needing a pickup truck to haul products but you go out and buy a Prius because the cost was good and gas mileage was even better.  Can you haul product in that Prius?  Sure, but you won't get nearly the same amount of work done if you would have bought the truck.\nStorage\nIt's important but not as critical as you'd think.  You need enough storage for what you're working on currently.  Everything else can be put on offline storage (external drives).  You may only need 256GB or 512GB.  This is where a little planning can save you money because Apple storage isn't cheap.\nConvenience Items\nEverything else is ancillary.  Touchbar, Magic Keyboard/Mouse TouchID, etc. are all conveniences.  Get what you think will make your computing experience easier.  None of it will have an impact on your video editing workflow - positive or negative.\nBottom Line\nWhat all this means you shouldn't be looking at anything that doesn't have the word \"Pro\" in it.  This means it's going to be expensive.  As for some financial advice, I would look at the secondary (used) market before dropping a credit card on a shiny new Mac.  If what you purchase isn't the right fit, you can sell it on that same market (eBay, Craigslist, etc.) and try something else.  You might find that the desktop models (iMac or Mac Pro) are a better fit.  You may even find that you need a \"good\" (but not the best) laptop and a desktop.\nMy advice here is to start small (financially) and find out what works for you before committing to a product that simply doesn't fit.\n\nA: It's also worth pointing out that Creative Cloud apps are not known for their efficient use of hardware resources, and some of them can be quite slow even on impressive CPUs.\nIf that's the computer you can afford, you may want to consider other apps to do the work. (Though I'd agree with what Allan says, particularly about RAM.)\nThe Affinity suite of apps (Designer, Photo, Publisher) are very good alternatives to Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.\nDaVinci Resolve is a free (for the basic version) video editing app, which is also very capable.\n", "Q: Intellimouse Optical-side buttons for Catalina \nMy ~20 year old Intellimouse Optical optical functions in Catalina.

Files are copied to the shared folder, sync’ed, between the cloud, the device and your PC, then moved from the  PC’s sync’ed folder to another one that’s s not synced.\n\n\n*If you are willing to spend $1 with Apple, you can do this at 50GB a time  For $2 with OneDrive you can do this at 100GB at a time.

As for “free apps” like GoodSync, I’m not a fan because nothing is free; or more colloquially, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.   What are you giving up to in exchange for that developer creating a program?  Usually it’s your private data.  Personally, I would spend a few dollars to do this securely and conveniently.\nNow all that said, how “overloaded” is this PC that iTunes won’t load but your willing to store your data on it?  I suggest attending to that PC first, then using iTunes, sync your filed via USB because it’s significantly faster and more reliable.

I would like to upgrade the OS. The only reason is that some new programs and devices (eg Wacom tablet) are not compatible with Yosemite. Otherwise it works perfectly for all my needs (a research mathematician). This is the 1st time I am doing this since I acquired this laptop and would like to do it myself (we don't have good Apple support here).\nQuestion: Can you give some advice/tips how to best perform this task?\nHere are some comments revealing my ignorance, to help you Mac experts guide me:\n\n*\n\n*I heard it is not a good idea to upgrade to the last OS (possible unresolved bugs, incompatible with some of my older programs). But I am not sure.\n\n\n*I am afraid that after upgrade some apps won't work or will be missing. Say Keynote. Or non-Apple programs, like Mathematica 9, or MikTex.\n\n\n*I am not sure the cloud services I am using, like Dropbox, will not work after the update. I have several of these, about 80GB on my MacBook Pro.\n\n\n*I am not sure where is a good place to download the update, especially if not the last one. Seems like Apple will only let you download the recent one, but I am not sure.\nA great answer can be just a link to some good article or a similar question on this forum.\nMUCHAS GRACIAS!!\n\nA: Welcome to the world of upgrading! These days, both Operating Systems and applications are regularly updated to keep pace with progress.\n'Not upgrading' has the advantage that you reached a static point where everything works (or at least has fixed, known bugs). The problem comes, as you've found out, when you want something new, and it requires a newer OS than yours.\nUpgrading 'one big jump' from very old software is more difficult than just 'the next version', because the change is so much larger. You will almost certainly have to update all your apps to match the OS, so you should check that there is a version compatible with the latest macOS (Catalina) for each one.\nThe good news is that any company still in business is likely to have current versions. Apple, as you would expect, has current versions of KeyNote, Pages and Numbers. Dropbox and other cloud services all have current versions.\nThe bad news is that some companies may require payment for newer versions.\nThere will always be unresolved bugs in any OS. But now is a good time in the 'annual cycle' to update, as Catalina is on its sixth and final release, so it's as good as it's going to get.\nYou should always download from Apple and nowhere else. Apple does make it difficult to obtain 'non-current' versions of the OS. This article provides links to some earlier versions on the Mac App Store.\nhttps://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/download-old-os-x-3629363/#toc-3629363-2\nIf you have any software that runs as 32-bit binaries, with no updates available to 64-bit versions, then you may prefer to run Mojave (10.14) instead of Catalina. Catalina can only run 64-bit executable code, and won't run older 32-bit code.\nIf you do have old apps that don't have upgrades available, then you have two options: either use a separate volume with the earlier OS and boot to that when you want to use those apps; or use Virtual Machine software, such as Parallels, VMWare or VirtualBox, to create an 'OS within an OS', where you can use the older software.\nGenerally, it's best to keep up (to some extent) with new versions regularly. You don't always have to be on the very latest: you can be '1 year behind', for instance. But keeping up ensures that you receive important security fixes, as well as bug fixes; and that you don't fall behind into the situation you are now in.\nIt can be a bit of a pain when every time you launch an app to do some work, there's an alert that a new version is available: do you want to install it now? But it's good to set a small amount of time to deal with 'software admin'. Some apps (and those from the Mac App Store) can be set to install silently in the background.\nRelying on software that is not being maintained is not a great place to be. Old, unsupported software will require old hardware, which eventually break down and become hard to repair or replace.\n\nA: You can erase Macs easily and reinstall the older OS. Why not make a good backup and then test the upgrade?\nWorst case, you find some things that break and erase and spend an hour reloading things from Time Machine. Best case, you now have a backup and things update and work.\nIf you are super concerned and your time is valuable, buy an external SSD and install the new os there. When it boots migrate your data and apps from the running system to the new external test. You don’t even risk your main system to do this test.\nApple has extensive support on choosing the specific installers you want:\n\n*\n\n*https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Asupport.apple.com++%E2%80%9Chow+to+upgrade+to%E2%80%9D&t=ipad&ia=web\n", "Q: Website subscribed to calendar Some how my iPhone calendar subscribed to a website and now I get reminders of really bad things in my calendar.

As far as I can tell this depends on whether the imgur filename begins with an upper case or a lower case letter.\nIs there any way I can get this selection behavior to be case-agnostic?\nWith chrome the selection always stops before the period, but Safari seems to be more \"creative\" in where the selection ends.\n\n\nTry it yourself!\ni.stack.imgur.com/GESmi.png\ni.stack.imgur.com/124RA.png\ni.stack.imgur.com/eFGbq.jpg\ni.stack.imgur.com/JOKd4.jpg  double tapping only selects \"JOKd4\" and not \".jpg\"\ni.stack.imgur.com/amD8b.jpg\ni.stack.imgur.com/wbP9b.jpg\ni.stack.imgur.com/bidkm.jpg\ni.stack.imgur.com/bebR8.jpg\n\n\nA: This is a quirk of the UAX #29 standard on Unicode word segmentation boundaries.  Basically, this document specifies standard rules for determining what's a \"word\" in a string of Unicode text.  Cocoa Text (the macOS text subsystem) conforms to these rules when implementing features like \"double click to select a word\".\nUsing uniseg, a Python library that implements these rules, we can see the word boundaries for these two strings:\nIn [1]: list(uniseg.wordbreak.words(\"JOKd4.jpg\"))                                                                                 \nOut[1]: ['JOKd4', '.', 'jpg']\n\nIn [2]: list(uniseg.wordbreak.words(\"eFGbq.jpg\"))                                                                                \nOut[2]: ['eFGbq.jpg']\n\nIn the first case, UAX #29 rules specify there are three words in the text (which you can check by trying to double-tap select each piece one by one).  In the second case, it specifies there is only one word.\nThis should be standard behavior across Cocoa apps, but overridable by individual apps if they care to.  Chrome, presumably, implements an override for text / word selection behavior beyond the Cocoa default.  I'm not sure if there is a way for users to override this behavior without access to source code.\n", "Q: Is there a downside on using APFS on a conventional HDD when using macOS 10.13 or later?

I know the advantages of APFS are mostly lost on a HDD, and that older systems don't work with APFS, but for me that is no issue.\nAre there downsides on using APFS that I should know of?\n\nA: Yes there are downsides to HDD formatted APFS instead of HFS+\nThe newer format is optimized for solid state characteristics.\nThe older format is optimized for HDD characteristics.\nUnless you are sure you need the new features, stick with the format that’s best for your storage type. If you don’t care about long term performance or use the storage lightly, it can be fine and not even measurable but heavy use will cause you to wipe and reformat the HFS in my experience if you choose and use APFS for months of continuous use on HDD as the inefficiencies build up over time and the storage allocation cannot self-optimize like HFS does on HDD.\nMy advice: Use Time Machine if you only have HDD to back up or provide SSD storage to Super Duper.\n", "Q: How can I see which macOS version is installed on an external disk, without booting into it? Is there a file somewhere in the System folder or in the Library that shows me which OS is installed on the disk?\n\nA: You can read the SystemVersion.plist on that particular volume-\n/Volumes/<volume_name>/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist \n\n\nA: If there's a valid, bootable system on it, then it will be listed in System Preferences > Startup Disk, with its version number.\n\n", "Q: What would make my mac lock I leave my Mac running overnight. Several times over the past month, I've come down and the screen saver is dead and the background of the screen is white. When I provide my password to unlock the screen saver, I get a note that accountsd wants my password to unlock my \"login\" keychain. If I provide it, dozens of other programs then ask for my password, like this:\n\n\n\nThere 50 to 100 more of these, and it just doesn't stop. I can't bring up Terminal to reboot the system, the finder is basically unusable. I can ssh in and do a sudo halt or I can just hit the power switch.\nIs anybody else experiencing this? Why is it happening? How do I make it stop?\n\nA: This is typical of a keychain error or issue or just an inconsistency in caching of auth tokens that indicate the grace period to not ask for a password after you log in once.\nCauses can be system keychain, user keychain, login keychain, time and date inconsistencies, system corruption.\nYou’ll need to isolate and troubleshoot these one by one if entering the passwords becomes troublesome.\n\nA: Usually, the Keychain Access password is the same as your Login password. But you can set a different password for Keychain Access. Sometimes this can cause issues like the one you are experiencing.\nTo fix this:\n(WARNING: All your saved passwords in Keychain will be lost by following the steps described below.)\n\n*\n\n*Using Spotlight or from the Applications > Utilities folder open KeyChain Access.\n\n*Open KeyChain Access menu and click Preferences.\n\n*In the Preferences window click the Reset My Default Keychains button.\n\n*For authentication, enter your Login password.\n\n*Close KeyChain Access and reboot macOS (Apple menu > Restart).\n\n", "Q: Code Highlighting is not working on Chrome, Big Sur I was reading the rust book, however the code was not highlighted.\n(It is using highlight js to highlight the code)\nOS: MacOS Big Sur public beta\nBrowser: Chrome(Maybe Chromium) (Not on Safari)\nScreenshot:\n\n(println! keyword is computed to orange in lower right)\nAs you can see, the code highlighting isn't working.\nHowever, the computed color is different from black.\nThis is really stressing me out.

While there is a joint venture to produce an API by Google and Apple which allows truly anonymous contact tracing, is there an API for more generic device tracing, similar to how Tile and other Bluetooth based trackers work, but still anonymous - reporting locations of Bluetooth ‘tags’ only to the user (and not, of course, making available any information about the device which performed the detection.\nI’m asking here because I can’t find a device/system which appears to be a suitable tracker (outside of the COVID API) which could be used for (eg) parents to track their children.\nThis question is specifically not about the ability for a service to provide information to users who have their app installed but wish to remain anonymous. It is about anonymous, community-based device reporting to allow Bluetooth ‘tags’ to be found.\n\nA: Yes - Apple’s API/SDK and framework for location aware Bluetooth technology is branded iBeacon.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/\nIt is designed for your device to orient itself and take actions as soon as it comes within range of known devices.

It all seems to go well until I discovered that the Photos Library was gone.  After looking through the TM backup, I see the last time it was backed up was 2018.  I did nothing I can imagine to exclude it. It's un-backed-up state is confirmed on a second off-site backup started in Feb of this year; the file simply does not exist.\nThere are no TM exclusion rules that would have prevented the file from being backed up.\n\nI suppose I'm out of luck on a recent version of the file, but why would this have happened?  Unless I'm missing something, this brings into question whether TM is a viable tool for backups.\nUpdate\nI decided to take my lumps and restore the old library.  17 GB of data is better than none.  I did check the next time TM ran and it happily backed up the library!  Note that I did not change any settings.\nThis gives me great pause in relying on Time Machine for backups.  It archives many of the files on my disk, but if it misses even one, that is always going to be the one that you need.\nAlso of note, this is the only machine I administer that I don't use a belt-and-suspenders approach to backups.  All my other machines have at least one TM backup plus a bootable backup with Carbon Copy Cloner.  I just ran out of CCC licenses for this machine.\n\nA: Time machine constantly takes snapshots of each file, this simply is a lot of data, and being conservative is important for the sake of the consumer's end. Harddrive reads and writes are expensive! Especially when it is the eventual cause for a harddrive to fail and a critical system backup is therefore lost on the consumer's end.\nApple offers ~/Pictures/Photos Library to be backed up to iCloud by default, and is cutting a corner for saving your backup. Time Machine also doesn't backup many large system files that apple deems a \"defaulted\" file from macOS and easily reclaimed from remote apple servers.\nUnrelated side-note: You can argue 5GB of free iCloud Storage isn't enough for even the Photos library alone, and you're right. But its incentive for you to pay for their service.\n", "Q: Why does it take so much time for \"Require Password\" to get turned on/off? Settings > [your name] > iTunes & App Store > Password Settings > Require Password (under FREE DOWNLOADS)\nThis just takes somewhere between a couple of seconds to a lot of seconds to get turned on/off. It's never worked instantly (even a second's delay that is perfectly observable isn't considered to be instant).\nIs it still a thing now? I'm on an iPad Gen 7 (2019 version)\n\nA: This is not a thing anymore (or maybe just means your device is slow, running poorly):\n\n*\n\n*FaceID makes this setting go away entirely\n\n*Turning off FaceID I am able to tap the toggle 6 times in 8 seconds. (Three complete on/off events)\n\nIt’s absolutely not instant to enable this as the system has to generate cryptographically secure tokens and store them in the Secure Enclave. Actual work has to be done when you modify this item. From my screen recording, it appears the disable is close to instant and the enable takes the majority of the duty cycle time.\n", "Q: Is there another way to boot into Recovery Mode without using the built-in keyboard? I am getting the folder with question mark issue in my 2014 Macbook Air (Catalina) and I need to boot into Recovery Mode.\nUnfortunately my MBA's keyboard already had issues beforehand, and some of the keys including R doesn't work (I normally just use external keyboards).\nI can't go to Recovery Mode using my wireless BT keyboard. I also tried plugging in my mechanical keyboard via USB (Anne Pro 2) but Cmd ⌘+R still doesn't register on boot.\nWould there be other ways of booting into Recovery Mode other than Cmd ⌘+R? Should I try and use other cheaper USB keyboards?\nOr is there another way to fix the blinking question mark problem? (I think I messed it up after erasing a disk and restarting right away without re-installing macOS).\nAny pointers would be appreciated, thank you!\n\nA: I was able to fix the blinking question mark issue by using a bootable USB installer to install Catalina on the Macbook Air—plugged in the bootable flash drive while holding Opt key. It was able to detect the installer.\n", "Q: How do I adjust Homepod stereo balance? I have a stereo pair of Homepods set up in a normal Hi-Fi set up; that is I sit between the speakers and the speakers and I are in a triangle.\n\n*\n\n*music volume is clearly unbalanced - a centre sound is louder on the right speaker.\n\n*I physically swapped the speakers several times to rule out a hardware issue.\n\n*My room is not symmetrical\n\n*I have tinnitus in my left ear so sound should adjust for this disablement.\n\nHow do I configure things so that central sounds sound from the middle to me?\nI play music either directly from Apple Music on Homepods or select Airplay on my iPad.\n\nA: Other than moving your speakers around about all you can do is play with the balance and the equalizer to adjust the sound to your liking.  There is a free app named eqMac which lets you apply an equalizer to your mac. It also has sensitive settings for the balance. You can adjust the balance to get the appropriate settings for your home pods. Maybe this balance adjuster does a better job than the internal one.\n\nA: On macOS, you need a utility to change this. On the iPad, iPhone or remove the pair and leave the speakers solitary if volume equality is more important than stereo separation.\n\n*\n\n*At this point you can set the relative volume levels.\n\n*There is no stereo pan control, just different volumes.\n\n\nIf you need stereo mapping, keep the HomePods in the stereo pair and add LoopBack processing to help adjust the mix. This also requires a Mac and the software is free to try, but the license is not cheap.  It could be cheaper than some hardware and a stereo setups and if you need or appreciate and can get perfect sound, the value could be there.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.rogueamoeba.com/support/manuals/loopback/?page=outputchannels\n", "Q: What is the radius of the windows on BigSur? I read Apple's What's New in macOS about BigSur, and they have mentioned about an increase in the window radius, but they have not mentioned anywhere about what the radius is.\n\nThroughout macOS 11, windows adopt visual touches that recall iOS interfaces. For example, windows integrate the sidebar, toolbar, and content areas, use an increased corner radius, and display lightweight controls.\n\nIn the past, the windows on macOS had a radius of around 7px. In BigSur, it is very clear that the radius of the corners has increased, but what is the exact radius of the windows?\n\nA: As far as I can tell from analyzing a screenshot from a MacBook Pro 15 Inch: 18px\n", "Q: If I change my Apple ID's country, would I need to re-download everything in order for all my apps to update naturally? Let's say I decide to change the country in my Apple ID, and I only have free apps that are available in both my previous and target country. Would I need to re-download everything in order for all my apps to update automatically?\nWould all my previous apps be considered to be from the previous country?\n\nA: Changing to a different country would not matter for the apps in the scenario you described. Your apps would continue to update fine and you need not re-download anything.\nAn app developer can choose what territories their apps are made available in. So when you switch to a different country, the same app may not be available.\nBut as long as the app is available in both the countries, you will be fine and receive the updates normally. If the app isn't available in the new location, it will stay installed and then never update / download from iCloud / App Store until it is available for your country or you switch back.\nUnless the app actively checks for this, things work - but it's really up to the developer how urgently they check for App Store receipts - the operating system doesn't force a check the moment you change and instead waits to check the next time an update or install happens.\n", "Q: /opt folder no longer accessible in finder on Catalina I have always been able to save to the /opt folder. I recently upgraded to macOS Catalina and can no longer see this folder.\nIn Finder I am able to display hidden folders and I can see it once again. However, when going to the Save As dialog in various programs I cannot see it there.\nHow can I make /opt visible again?\n\nA: Make sure that you are using /System/Volumes/Data/opt instead of /opt, because the later is not writable due to security features. If you are sure the folder is on the data partition, then chflags nohidden /System/Volumes/Data/opt should unhide it.\n\nA: macOS Catalina splits the boot volume into two distinct components, named Startup and Data. It runs off of a read-only filesystem, which is separate from the data files. So even if you find /opt, you may not be able to write to it.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT210650\nTo access and write to it, try going to /System/Volumes/Data/opt using Finder or Terminal. In Finder, you can user the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + G to bring Go To Folder... mini window, and enter the location.\n\nA: chflags nohidden /System/Volumes/Data/opt\n\nsetfile -a v /System/Volumes/Data/opt\n\n", "Q: What will happen when a video's resolution is not as high as that of the screen (of Apple's products) Will iPad/Mac/iPhone's screen do some automatic revision/improvement to the quality of videos whose resolution is not as high as iPad/Mac/iPhone's native screen resolution, so that the video looks as if it has higher resolution than what it should have been?\n\nA: By default, no. It is though very common for video to be \"upscaled\" meaning basically that it is resized to fill more of the screen. This doesn't improve it's quality - some times it can actually degrade quality (when the source and target resolutions are not scaled by an integer factor).\nHowever in general you cannot say either yes or no to your question. A program or app can choose to do its own quality improvement of videos before displaying them. Usually such quality improvements comes with a set of drawbacks, or at least that it only actually works for a subset of videos.\n", "Q: CATALINA: Override automatic mute triggered by Dictation PROBLEM\nTranscription Step 2 Instructions indicates:\n\nWhen you’re running Dictation, your computer automatically mutes all\naudio that’s playing.

I want to speed it up some and I have decided to get an external SSD. I want to make this my boot disk as well as data storage. The SSD I'm considering is 3 TB. My concern is the connection speed. The 2010 iMac has USB 2 I believe and a Firewire 400. The drive I'm considering has USB 3.0/3.1 and a Firewire 400 connections. Will these be sufficient to use with my iMac? Which connection would be better-suited speed-wise. The Firewire 400 or USB 2?\n\nA: This doesn't directly answer your question, but may be some help.\nI have an early 2008 iMac, the entry level 24\" iMac 2.8GHz processor, 2 GB RAM, SuperDrive, ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO with 256MB of VRAM and a 320 GB HD.\nMany years ago I upgraded to 6GB RAM and installed a 2TB Seagate SSHD Solid State Hybrid Drive (a physical HDD with an SSD flash module) which mimics Apple's “Fusion“ drive. These upgrades still work perfectly.\nThe performance improvements were remarkable... prior to the upgrade MS Excel was taking over two minutes to load and following the upgrade, it took literally a few seconds. Boot time dropped from about two and a half minutes to less than one minute.\nIn fact the machine still works perfectly despite no longer been supported by OS upgrades.\nThe reason I'm suggesting this:\n\n*\n\n*as per comments by @user3439894 the performance will be much better;\n\n*it is not difficult to do the work to swap the drives yourself.\n\nIf you're interested in pursuing this option, there is an excellent guide on iFixit that provides detailed step-by-step instructions.\nAlso as mentioned by @user3439894 and as quoted from Apple's support website, your machine has:\n\nOne FireWire 800 port; 7 watts\n\nYour iMac also shipped with 4GB RAM. I'd strongly recommend you consider upgrading this to 8GB RAM. There are a few good websites that help you pick the correct RAM for your iMac and replacement modules should be reasonably priced. This is an easy upgrade as the RAM modules can be switched out without dismantling any part of the machine. Only need to remove the RAM slot cover = 1 screw. Refer to the Apple Support website for instructions.\nUpdates\nAs mentioned by others, I grabbed the technical information from Apple’s website “iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010) - Technical Specifications”\nThis image from Apple’s website Identify the ports  on your Mac, should help you identify which FireWire you have:\n\nIf your ports are inaccessible at the current time, instead use this technique:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Apple logo top left of your menu bar;\n\n*Open “About This Mac”;\n\n*On the Overview tab, click on “System Report...”;\n\n*Scroll down the list under the heading “Hardware” until you find “FireWire”.\n\nClicking on the FireWire subheading should confirm your FireWire type.\nAs mentioned by David Anderson in the comments, you have a few options to upgrade storage internally. Not sure if that requires a new question, but happy to provide my decision making process, if you’re interested. Essentially you can:\n\n*\n\n*Swap out the SuperDrive for an SSD leaving the exisiting HDD in place;\n\n*Swap out the HDD for an SSHD or SSD and leave the SuperDrive in place.\n\nI chose the latter because it was the easiest upgrade and in my humble opinion the most cost effective, also I was nostalgic about keeping my SuperDrive (nothing to do with a logical decision!).\n\nA: FireWire 800 is the fastest external connection you have, and roughly matches the 6 Gbps speed of the SATA III drive interface, (though 'real-world' performance may be reduced, and a direct internal connection may be slightly faster).\nFW 400 is, as the name suggests, half the speed.\nUSB 2.0 is considerably slower.\nUsing anything other than FW800 is going to limit the benefit of having the SSD.\nI'm surprised that any manufacturer is producing a drive with USB 3.1 and FW 400, rather than 800, TBH.\n", "Q: Apple Watch can detect my approach? Apple Watch, I think third gen.\nOn it's charger near the front door of the house, both on a huge pillow.  Face is pointed up.\niPhone is charging at the opposite side of the house, so neither one is moving.\nWhen I get about two meters from the watch, the face lights up.  This has happened several times.  Is this just coincidence, or is it responding to the extremely small vibrations of my approach?  Or some other method?\nHard to attribute it to the accelerometer, since it often seems reluctant to light up when I  am wearing it and lift my hand to check the time.\nI believe I've seen it happen on a fixed surface as well, but I suppose those would actually vibrate more than a pillow.\n\nA: Apple Watch have proximity sensors on the wrist side and face side. It’s how you can silence notifications and sounds and turn off the display by placing your hand over the display.\nNightstand mode alters the point at which the display lights when sensors see a change in proximity of an object and also more sensitive to nudges.\nNudging the watch or table (or in your case, bed or floor) also works as well to light the display in nightstand mode.\n", "Q: Finding out property list (plist) attributes and/or processes Apple’s own web page indicates how to Edit property lists in Terminal on Mac.

The names of the keys and the different possible values are determined by the application, which can be developed by Apple or by any third party, and there is no standard.\nTo find different combination of keys/values usable in a plist file, you can do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Read the documentation. But often Apple doesn't provide full documentation.\n\n\n*Find existing plist file and modifiy them, by deducing and trying different keys/values.\n\n\n*Run the command strings on the executable to dump out all text.

Or is there another way to roll back Activity data? First, the problem: I accidentally entered a 25-hour workout manually instead of a 1-hour workout (I entered \"yesterday at time X to today at time X+1\", instead of \"…to yesterday at time X+1\").  I deleted it immediately, but the damage was done.  This gave me thousands of unearned exercise minutes and has awarded me an unbeatable exercise record achievement, which are both really frustrating – I've been tracking my data for over a year now, and this really gets in the way of that.\nUnfortunately, after talking to Apple Support for over an hour, I learned that there really isn't a way to undo this.  The exercise minutes haven't gone away, even though Apple Support said they were supposed to, and Apple Support said there's literally no way to remove achievements short of resetting my data completely.\nExcept!  The reason I'm in this pickle is that my Apple Watch actually basically died recently (or maybe not quite, some of the issue seems to be with the charger (that I've now replaced)) – it's barely charging (this might be cable-related), discharging quite rapidly, and basically isn't usable.  However, it might be usable enough to connect to my phone and unpair from it, which would create a backup with the old, pre-disaster activity data.  There's just one catch: as soon as I connect it to my phone, it's going to sync, importing the new data and breaking everything.  Apple Support wasn't sure if there was a way around this.\nSo that's my current situation.  I have my phone and a borrowed Apple Watch with the post-disaster, thousands-of-exercise-minutes Activity data, and my old Apple Watch with the pre-disaster good Activity data.  I want to import the data from my old Apple Watch and zap the data from the new Apple Watch.  How can I do this?\nI'm also interested in other ways to solve this same problem – I'm under no illusions that I've thought about this completely enough to totally explore the problem space.  But this is the best idea I've had.\n\nIn short: Can I (1) connect an Apple Watch to my iPhone (2) without syncing activity data, then (3) unpair it to create a backup, and (4) restore another Watch from that backup, thereby (5) wiping out the past few days of activity data?  Or is there a better way?\n\nProduct versions:\n\n*\n\n*Phone: iPhone 8+, iOS 13.5.1\n\n*Old watch: Apple Watch Series 4, 44m, watchOS 6.2.8\n\n*New watch: Apple Watch Series 5, 40m, watchOS 6.1\n\n\nI also asked this question on Reddit in /r/applehelp.\n\nA: So - as a direct answer to your question - no, unfortunately it doesn't appear possible to do what you're asking.\nNow for a longer, more descriptive answer. After carrying out some research and performing some of my own tests, it unfortunatley doesn't appear that it's possible to simply remove a single exercise whilst also deleting the corresponding award earned from it; removing the exercise from within the Health app leaves the award which can, as you mentioned, still be found within the Activity app. The following threads posted to the Apple Discussions forum were posted by users who also had a similar problem - confirming the above:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8257414\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/250261634\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/250009083\nIn addition to this, it also doesn't appear possible to use the backup of an Apple Watch to simply replace the Activity data/rewards on the Watch's paired iPhone; that said, I'm not 100% sure whether the Watch backup itself actually includes any Activity data itself, or whether this is only retained on your iPhone. It appears that the only way to resolve this is to reset your Health data - which is far from ideal, but appears to be the only resolution at this time.\n", "Q: Music app launches with bluetooth earbud connection in Catalina This has been asked before  in the days of iTunes, but I'm still having trouble and the one Catalina-centric comment on that thread didn't work for me. I never want to use apple's music app, yet I manage to open on a daily basis by either connecting my bluetooth earbuds (Taotronics Liberty 79) or possibly by pressing the play/pause button on them. Sometimes it starts playing the few sad lonely songs I've purchased from apple. I want none of this and would uninstall Music.app if it were possible. Is there a way to prevent music from opening inadvertently like this?

Is it possible to be on a speakerphone call with my iPhone and then use the Voice Memos app on the Apple Watch to record the conversation? I'm not thinking that the Apple Watch would have access to the iPhone's mic or anything sophisticated like that… just record the audio coming from the iPhone's speaker and the audio coming from my mouth.\nI tried to launch Voice Memos on my iPhone during a call. Unsurprisingly, the mic was blocked while the call was active. It feels like an Appley thing to also block Voice Memos on the Apple Watch during a call. I don't have an Apple Watch… otherwise I'd be testing this on my own.\nAnd yes, I know there are other methods of recording calls (via apps that intercept calls and other similar services, jailbreaking, and even just getting a pocket recorder thing), but I'm already interested in an Apple Watch, and this functionality would be icing on the cake.\n\nThe backstory, if you're interested: I'm rearranging some personal finance stuff and much of the phone conversations I have with financial advisors goes right over my head (i.e. rapid-fire jargon, acronyms, and calculations). My hand written notes can't keep up! It would be great if I could just record the call so that I can research terminology and go over the calculations later. Not trying to do anything nefarious here… I would, of course, inform the person on the other line that I would be recording.\n\nA: Just to close the loop here, yes, you can record audio on your Apple Watch while your iPhone is on an active call (on speaker phone). I do this all the time to supplement my notes from an important phone call with an audio recording… with the permission of the person on the other line, of course.\n", "Q: Macbook swaps external displays when lid closed or opened I have a Macbook Pro connected to two external displays via a docking station.  With the lid open, it will use all three, with the primary set to one of the external displays, let's say display 1.  If I close the lid, the internal display shuts off, which is great.  However display 2 now becomes primary, and all the windows on display 2 move to display 1 and vice versa.  I open the lid, and it switches back.  Not that big a deal just a mild annoyance, but I have not found any information about how to make it stop.\nCatalina 10.15.6, MacBook Pro 15 inch 2018\nRadeon Pro 560X 4GB\nIntel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB\n\nA: You need to set the display layout in each scenario. For example set the display arrangement when the macbook screen is opened and you should do it once again for when the laptop display is shut.\nThat should do the trick.\n", "Q: How can a new iPhone know the names of people in my photos? I recently got a new iPhone. As a part of setting it up I synced my photos from my PC to the new iPhone (as I did with the old device). After that, I waited for the phone to run it's face recognition. What surprised me was that some people got named correctly by the new phone (I provided the names to the old phone). I thought face recognition only runs locally. Both phones have iCloud Photos, My Photo Stream and Shared Albums disabled (the new phone had it enabled by default, but I switched it off in advance of syncing the photos).\nEdit: The old phone was the first iPhone SE, the new one's the second generation. Both are running the newest iOS versions.\nI was under the impression face recognition feature respect the users (and more important the users friends) privacy and is not crowd sourced and only exists on my device.\nHow is this possible?\n\nA: The name data comes down from iCloud document and key-value-store sync. Even if you don’t use iCloud to store photos, metadata about photos does sync by default. This is similar how to small settings sync between devices. Apple could handle it like screen time where you explicitly opt in or out of this per device, but as of Big Sur and iOS 14 there is no granular opt in or out for this.\nApple doesn’t generate the names, you do on your phone or the iPad / web / macOS version of photos app and then Apple remembers it in your encrypted data store. The “identities” are all machine generated and one “person” can match several machine “matches” in practice.\nUntil you tell your device to forget that name or that face, that label is attached to the “identity” in the synced data store attached to your iCloud storage bucket.\n\nA: I assume that you are using Apple's cloud solution to sync photos. So there is no surprise that new iPhone got info from the iCloud about your friends. Relax, we are all indexed ;)\n", "Q: How can I tell Automator to display an image with Preview but actual size? I am trying to have Automator do a simple task: display an image, but actual size. The problem is that Preview by default wants to 'fit' the image on the screen, but there appears to be no way to tell Automator to tell Preview to do it 'actual size' instead.\nIs there a way to do this or do I simply have to find another way and avoid Preview.app?\n\nA: Without seeing your actual Automator workflow, the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is to add a Run AppleScript action, after the action that opens the file in Preview, with the following example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Preview\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Preview\"\n        if value of ¬\n            attribute \"AXMenuItemMarkChar\" of ¬\n            menu item \"Actual Size\" of ¬\n            menu 1 of ¬\n            menu bar item \"View\" of ¬\n            menu bar 1 is missing value then\n            \n            click menu item \"Actual Size\" of ¬\n                menu 1 of ¬\n                menu bar item \"View\" of ¬\n                menu bar 1\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis is similar to manually pressing ⌘0 while in Preview, which activates the Actual Size menu item on its View menu, if it is not already showing its actual size.\nThis also assumes the default preference of Define 100% scale as: 1 image pixel equals 1 screen pixel is in play.\n\n Note: Using the example AppleScript code may require adjusting settings under: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy \n\nA: I agree with @user3439894. The easiest thing to do would be to add a “Run AppleScript” action to your Automator workflow.\nHowever, though the solution he provided is perfectly valid, the conditional clause he uses is un-necessary with my alternate solution.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Preview\"\n    set frontmost to true\n    repeat until frontmost\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    click menu item \"Actual Size\" of menu 1 of menu bar item ¬\n        \"View\" of menu bar 1\nend tell\n\nIf the menu item \"Actual Size\" is already selected, the code will just finish without throwing an error.\nI am also assuming that Preview.app is already running before “Run AppleScript” action in your Automator workflow, otherwise there would be no application process \"Preview” , therefore it would throw an error.\n", "Q: Time machine backed up size keeps increasing This is the first Time Machine backup I've done after factory resetting laptop (Macbook pro 2019 Catalina 10.15.6).\nThe backup started off displaying a sensible amount of backup to run (e.g., \"backing up 0 MB of 20 GB\"). Then after hitting or getting close to that total, the backup size increased, i.e: Backing up 22.00 GB... Backing up 25.00 GB... and continues like this infinitely.\nHow can I solve this issue?\n\nA: There are some details missing from your question, but here's my guess based on what you've said:\nThe \"factory reset\" probably looks like a first-time backup to Time Machine, and so it is backing up your entire HD/SSD. If you back up tomorrow, the amount of data will probably be much less.\nIn other words - this may not be an issue at all - simply Time Machine doing what it was programmed to do.\n", "Q: How to change part of file Quick Look previews? For specific files I would like Quick Look to preview the end of the document, rather than its front. In this case I am working with CSVs and want the preview to show the most recent additions. (I’m aware the previews are cached and maybe not fully up to date.)\n1. Is there a way to change what Quick Look displays, especially which parts of a file?\n2. Can this be done for specific files, rather than globally?\nMy research so far leads me to think qlmanage in Terminal is how I’d change this, but I’m not sure how. (Also not on Mac right now and qlmanage’s man page is ... sparse.)\nI could also imagine an approach that changes where a file opens to – opening to the end of the document instead of its start – and that the preview would then do similar\n\nA: You're on the right path with qlmanage.  Unfortunately, using qlmanage is the last step in assigning a Quick Look generator to your file type.  You first have to obtain the generator, or write it from scratch.\nSo, to quickly answer both of your questions... yes, you can change what QL displays and yes, you can do it for a single file type.\nTo see what generators are associated with what file types, use the -m flag.  Here's a sample of the output\n% qlmanage -m\n\n  com.apple.iwork.pages.pages-tef -> /System/Library/QuickLook/iWork.qlgenerator (209)\n  com.microsoft.powerpoint.ppt -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (40)\n  public.comma-separated-values-text -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (40)\n  com.apple.ical.ics.todo -> /System/Library/QuickLook/iCal.qlgenerator (906.3)\n  com.adobe.encapsulated-postscript -> /System/Library/QuickLook/EPS.qlgenerator (906.3)\n\nWithin each of those directories is code, very similar to a macOS Application,  that  generates a QL preview; so you can, in fact, create a preview to your specifications.\nAs for how to create that code, see the Introduction to Quick Look Programming Guide to get started.  The code is written in ANSI-C or Objective-C.\n", "Q: From which version does Safari not support 32 bit architecture? I have a problem with Safari on different macOS versions. Is there any information from which version Safari doesn't support 32 bit architecture? Like Firefox (from v.56) and Chrome (from v.74) on macOS.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)#64-bit_builds - Safari has been 64-bit since Snow Leopard OS X 10.6 in 2009, which would be Safari 5, [around the same time they stopped supporting Windows.]\nAll Macs since then have been 64-bit capable, but until Catalina have been backwards compatible with 32-bit applications.\nThe last OS X to be capable of running on 32-bit architecture was also Snow Leopard, 10.6\nThe App Store will only offer you builds of Safari compatible with your Mac's hardware & OS\nSafari 11 - 10.11 to 10.12\nSafari 12 - 10.12 to 10.13\nSafari 13 - 10.13 to 10.15\nSafari 14 - macOS 11 [backwards compatibility currently unknown]\n", "Q: Run a list of commands in a script Trying to run this and get no such file or folder even though the individual files work in terminal.\n#!/bin/bash\n\npkill Microsoft Teams\n\nrm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Teams/blob_storage/*\nrm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Teams/Cache/*\nrm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Teams/databases/*\nrm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Teams/GPUCache/*\nrm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Teams/IndexedDB/*\nrm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Teams/Local Storage/*\n\necho \"Clearing Microsoft Teams Cache\"\n\nI know this must be basic stuff but not a Mac user normally.\n\nA: Quoted Spaces\nA couple of lines need quoting to deal with spaces:\npkill Microsoft Teams\n\nShould read:\npkill \"Microsoft Teams\"\n\nand Local Storage needs a slash to become Local\\ Storage.\nAbsolute Paths\nIf you continue to encounter problems, try expanding the ~ and use absolute/full paths.

You don't \"launch\" finder in the conventional sense.  It's always running. It's the graphical interface through which you interact with your Mac system.  You open a file using Finder's file selection tools or view the contents using Preview, etc.\nGet to know the Finder on your Mac\n\nThe purpose of this would be for the end user to, when running a shell script, be able to select a file using a GUI instead of typing in the path and filename.\n\nBouncing back and forth between a GUI and a text environment is inefficient.  Why would you begin typing a command in a text environment, then switch to a GUI to get your file, then switch back to text?  Instead, you create the File Selection Dialog Box right there in the text environment.\nThere's a tool called dialog available on MacPorts and on Homebrew that allows you to create dialog and file selection boxes in your text environment.  Below is an example of the file selection box from the deletefile.sh script (similar to what you described).\n\nFor more examples of the different dialog boxes you can create, see:  https://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog-figures.html\n\nA: You can launch GUI Dialog to select a file in shell script with following code:\ntheSelectedFile=\"$(osascript -l JavaScript -e 'a=Application.currentApplication();a.includeStandardAdditions=true;a.chooseFile({withPrompt:\"Please select a file to process:\"}).toString()')\"\n\necho \"Selected file: $theSelectedFile\"\n\n\nYou can customize Window title: see withPromptattribute\n\nA: tselect\nMy tiny swift cli tselect (terminal selection file) may meet your need.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make my macbook automatically execute a script every time I connect it to an external monitor?

It booted up in El Capitan, so my first order of business after the initial sign-in and setup was to attempt to upgrade the OS to Mojave, or less preferably, to Catalina. Mojave first because some of my audio software still uses a few 32 bit plugins which have not as yet been up-written to 64 bit.\nThe problem: When I go to the app store (via any path, internal or external) signed in to the Store or not, and click the Download button for either Mojave or Catalina, no download happens. For Mojave, the Download button changes to dark grey and says \"Downloading\", the 'spinner' spins for 20 seconds and stops. A status bar underneath shows the progress dot stuck at the beginning, with no movement, even overnight. For Catalina, the Download button changes to dark grey, but still says \"Download\", not \"Downloading\", the 'spinner' spins for four seconds and disappears, but no progress bar is displayed, and nothing else happens, at least not within the coming hour.\nHere's the catch: downloads of other apps from the Store to this machine work normally, as evidenced by my quick and successful downloads of Battery Health 2, and an attempt at downloading LastPass password manager (which I then declined until the OS is upgraded - but it was ready to work.)\nWhat have I tried..? Sign out of Store, close Store, reboot computer, sign back in to Store, try again. Did this with sequence variations several times. Tested using two external page links direct to the Store's Mojave and Catalina pages, same result. Copy-pasted a forum-suggested line of code into Terminal to reset the Store, but system rejected part of the code as an unknown reference. Have read every forum suggestion I can find on this, but none of the previous questions or answers seem to address this situation exactly, in that only the OS downloads won't start, but others are okay.\nAccording to the applications chart this Mid-2014 Macbook Pro is clearly eligible for all OS up through Catalina. My two other Mac computers on this network (one also running El Capitan) interact normally with the Store.\nSuggestions? Thanks.\n\nA: We do this all the time. Here is a quick process.\n\n*\n\n*How to download Mojave now that Catalina is available?\nWhen this doesn’t work, it’s almost always the network so take your Mac to a new location (public library, school, different ISP) or have a friend download the installer and make them a pie or meal in thanks.\n", "Q: How to change my caps lock key to work as a tab?

More than likely, you've got APFS containers set up and if one of the volumes is corrupt and you're not properly removing it (via the format), this boot loop could be a symptom.  So, let's wipe it clean and put a plain macOS file system on it (not APFS).  When you boot into Recovery, launch Terminal and type the following command:\n$ diskutil JHFS+ \"Macintosh HD\" disk0\n\nNormally on a MacBook laptop, the internal drive is disk0, but to be completely certain, you can do a diskutil list and look for the \"internal\" drive, similar to what's below:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n\nNext, once you've done that, reboot your Mac, again into Recovery.

It doesn't have to be large - 64GB should be fine, but I recommend USB 3 for the speed.  Don't install Big Sur (or any beta OS for that matter) on your \"work machine.\"  If things go sideways, like they did here, you'll have trouble getting back.  By installing and booting from a USB drive, you can easily revert back to your original macOS.\n\nA: Had the same problem, after upgrade to Big Sur my Mini got stuck at the setup assistant.

The app is not free but has a free trial version that you can download from the link above.\nYou'll need to start with a clean drive and you can make a clone of your internal drive. It is a simple procedure and the complete instructions are given here. This link is dated 3/2020 so it is recent. The instructions will tell you how to make a bootable clone.\nAfter making a bootable clone, the linked article has a section telling you how to restore your Mac from a clone if necessary. And there are other features given in the article as well.\n", "Q: Recover an overwritten Mac note I was changing the fonts and accidentally selected all the content of the note which got overwritten. Command + Z doesn't seem to work and I have no backup. Is there a way to recover?\nI have tried the solutions in Overwritten Mac note but it doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: Even if you’re sure you don’t use iCloud, go ahead and turn it on and check https://iCloud.com for notes and deleted notes.\nEven if you’re sure you don’t use time machine, connect a drive and see if you can enter time machine to browse local backups and snapshots.\nThese two methods have saved me and also saved people that were convinced they didn’t have backups.\nI hope you have a backup of some sort to piece together the notes database and don’t lose this work.\n", "Q: Log in to a monitor-less Mac over the network Is it possible to share the screen OR remotely ssh login to a Mac that has no user logged in, i.e. it's sitting on the login screen after power-on/restart? The Mac in question uses macOS 10.15.6(ish).\nBackground story\nI'm having a problem with getting the monitor to wake up properly, connected to a Mac Mini 2018 - purchased two months ago.\n( The monitor problem is the original, but separate, long story problem on its own so I'll leave it out for now, if you're interested check out lots of threads over the net about it, especially https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8623270 - the original problem itself warrants its own thread(s))\nSo from a powered-up state, if I power on the Mac mini, as the monitor won't turn on properly, but I suspect that it actually might be on (because the power LED is on), it maybe ends up on the macOS login screen. The Mac mini itself has screen sharing and remote login turned on, so I was wondering if it should be possible to remote login to this computer from another Mac etc. Current attempts however; I haven't been able to spot the computer on the network. It doesn't show up in Network in Finder. I've tried pinging \"mac-mini.local\" etc, to no avail. The network name of the Mac mini should be just that, the default \"Mac Mini\".\nMy idea is, if I can login to the monitor-less Mac Mini, I can make sure it's even \"alive\".\n\nA: My mac mini is shutdown at 01.00 and restarts at 06.00 every day.\nIt starts without a monitor and the tv it is connected to is off.\nI can them remote login using the remote server menu & browse which shows all the macs I have that are connected to the network and even thiugh it has not been logged into directly yet, I can login to it from any of the other machines.\n\nA: After some research, here is what I found. There seems to be two separate cases.\nWell the question is:\nIs it possible to share the screen OR remotely ssh login to a Mac that has no user logged in, i.e. it's sitting on the login screen after power-on/restart?\nAnswer 1: No. After a cold boot or restart, the computer does NOT appear in Network in Finder.\nAnswer 2: Yes. If we ignore the cold boot or restart, and login to said computer at least once, and then log out of all accounts such that we end up on the login screen.\nSo answer 1 seems to be the correct answer to the question I have (I have no way to login to the computer on the computer itself because the screen is black).\n", "Q: How can I install macOS on the second hard drive inside a computer? I just bought a 2011 Mac mini which has two hard drives inside. One of the hard drives had a Mac Recovery I was able to transfer my data to with Time Machine, the other one is called \"Windows\" so I'm assuming it's formatted differently.\n\nCan I format the Windows drive to install a Mac system on it without opening the computer?\nEdit: After reinstalling twice, I am not sure there is a second hard drive inside the Mac anymore. I updated the question here. I will edit further this question once I understand what is going on inside this machine.\n\nA: Yes, you can. You should 1st check if you can read the windows disk. If so, make sure there is nothing on it you want. If you don't care what's on it skip that and go to disk utility. Using disk utility you can erase the windows disk and reformat it in a format you want. Then you can load the Mac System on the disk.\n", "Q: What does \"FileVault: No (Encrypted at rest)\" mean? I have a new MacBook Air 2020 running Catalina 10.15.6 and I'm asking about the encryption on the internal SSD. When I run diskutil apfs list it shows that both the \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Macintosh HD - Data\" volumes have the following:\nFileVault:                 No (Encrypted at rest)\nWhat does this mean? If these drives are already encrypted at rest, should I, or do I need to, turn on Filevault to protect the data on them in case my MacBook is stolen?\n\nA: It means that the SSD is encrypted by the built-in T2 chip. On newer Macs encryption is always enabled and handled by the T2 chip.\nThis means that the disk is encrypted when at rest, essentially meaning when the computer is powered off and/or the disk drive is removed from the computer. However as soon as someone turns on the computer, the T2 will supply the necessary key and make the drive contents available.\nYou will most probably want to enable FileVault. This ensures that your drive cannot be decrypted simply by powering on the computer, but will require your secret password.\n", "Q: Unable to write to any external USB, even after formatting it I have a MBP running OS X Mojave (10.14.2)\nAny USB drive I connect is always read-only and I can never write to it.

If you do, edit your question to include a complete log of commands you type and the result. (Or put it in the comments).\nIf that is not the case, then it's likely a permission issue. In your terminal, enter:\nsudo -i\n\nand enter your password. The password will NOT show on your screen. When you are done, hit enter. Then, enter the following:\ntouch /volumes/NONAME/1\n\nand see if there is any error. If not, then it's a permission issue. Execute the following command:\nchown -R <your account name here> /volumes/NONAME\nchmod -R 755 /volumes/NONAME\nexit\n\nSee if you can write to the folder.

It won't show as present in your desktop folder as that's not really where it is. It is mounted at /Volumes in your OS, the same way all your other drives are mounted. Their appearance on the visible desktop is for convenience.\nTo all intents & purposes a mounted disk image behaves exactly like any other removable drive.\nNormally, you open it [or it should open automatically] to show the contents.\nThen there are two basic installation methods.\nSimple drag & drop - there will be an app & an alias to your Applications folder.

When you launch one of these you will be presented with an admin permissions dialog to allow the installer to do this.\nPic again with .dmg file to the left, mounted disk to the right & installation window below.

Or maybe, they're both right, but map the keys differently?\n\nA: Neither is correct nor incorrect.\nThe ESC control code is part of the ANSI escape sequences which was used to send control codes to early terminals like the VT-100.  Emacs used many of these Esc sequences to control how the the user interacted with the program.\nThe Meta key first showed up in 1970 on the SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Labs) keyboards, MIT’s Lisp computers and ultimately Sun Microsystems (my alma mater as tech companies go).  It appeared as a diamond key.\nThe Meta is a modifier key similar (in function) to what the Apple Command key was.  On modern keyboards, it maps to ALT (Option) or the Windows key on PC keyboards.  If a computer lacks the Meta key, you can send the ESC sequence.\nEither one is fine, iTerm (IMO) seems to take a more global approach to connecting to various *nix machines where Terminal is Apple/OpenStep (since Apple acquired them) and uses a Meta key.\nIn the end it’s what you’re more comfortable with - Esc or Meta/Option\n", "Q: What happened to jabber / hangouts options in messages?

For reference, the procedure for installing an older version of a single package is documented here.\n\nA: Thank you to Lothar Haeger on the Macports mailing list for giving me the key hint I needed. What I had to do was:\n\n*\n\n*Checkout a local copy of the Macports Port Tree from Github. cd ~; git clone https://github.com/macports/macports-ports\n\n\n*Reset my local port tree to an earlier point in time. cd macports-ports; git reset --hard commit-hash-from-2018\n\n\n*Generate a port index for my local port tree: portindex\n\n\n*Tell Macports to use my local port tree in place of the official online one. To do this, I opened macports's sources.conf (generally in /opt/local/etc/macports/) in a text editor, commented out the default URL at the bottom of the file, and added after it: file:///Users/my-user-name/macports-ports [default]\n", "Q: disk space not being reclaimed When I first log in to my mac, the bottom of the finder window shows 28.7 GB available\nAs soon as I interact with the finder, that changes to 417.35 GB available\nAbout this mac > Storage shows 417.35GB out of 751.07GB\nHowever, in the terminal df shows:\nFilesystem    512-blocks       Used Available Capacity iused               ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1  1466930136 1408631896  54750856    97% 2915208 9223372036851860599    0%   \ndevfs                368        368         0   100%     638                   0  100%   /dev\n/dev/disk1s4  1466930136    2097200  54750856     4%       1 9223372036854775806    0%   \n/private/var/vm\nmap -hosts             0          0         0   100%       0                   0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home          0          0         0   100%       0                   0  100%   /home\n/dev/disk0s1      403218      25912    377306     7%       0                   0  100%   \n/Volumes/firmwaresyncd.UxqR5T\n\nOmnisweeper shows 28.7 GB free, 720.6 GB used, 751.1 GB total\nWhen I am working with certain applications in the terminal, I get errors/warnings about disk space being too low...\nI tried booting into safe mode, and the progress bar got to 95% and sat there for... 20 minutes..

The end result I was hoping for was the existence of commands mogrify and convert. It had apparently been a long time since I ran Homebrew; tt thought for a long time and then went about updating a positively frightening number of packages. It ran for perhaps 45 minutes, and I really have no idea how much it updated. Dozens, scores, perhaps hundreds of packages. Including Ruby and Python, which was pretty scary in its own right.\nAfter all that time Homebrew reported failure because something it was trying to instlal required a later version of Xcode than was installed. It turns out that the version it wanted was part of Catalina, and my OS is still at Mojave, so I can't upgrade Xcode to satisfy Homebrew.\nWhen all was done, the mogrify command exists and works but the convert command is nowhere to be found.\nI have tried redoing 'brew install imagemagick' -- it says the package is already installed and refuses to do anything. 'brew upgrade imagemagick' worked once but there is still no convert command to be found.\nDo I have to uninstall and start over?\n\nA: Think I resolved the problem. convert is present in /usr/local/Cellar/imagemagick/7.0.10-28/bin as a symlink to magick; which led me to look in /usr/local/bin where mogrify exists as a symlink; convertis present there too. Running rehash (hash -r) brought it into visibility on the path.\n", "Q: Power Macintosh G4 won't boot after plugging in an external HDD Last weekend I got an old PowerMac G4 \"Gigabit Ethernet\" and it worked fine for a few hours. Then after plugging in my external HDD to copy some of the data over, the system went to sleep and wouldn't turn back on. I proceeded to turn off the Mac and unplug the HDD; once I rebooted, I was met with a long load time (about two minutes) with no Apple on the light-gray screen -- followed by the Finder icon with a question mark.\nI looked up articles and forums to help, but so far nothing has worked. I have tried pressing Alt+R (Command+R) to get into the recovery menu -- and while the menu does appear just fine, there's no option for anything to boot from; it just shows me the \"reload\" icon and an arrow pointing to the right.\nAnother thing I tried doing was I burned an .iso of Mac OS X Tiger (the Power Mac has 10.4.11) and try loading that from Recovery mode, but it still does nothing; the disc doesn't appear in the menu. In fact, the disc barely spins in the drive; the LED just blinks a few times when the system powers on, then quickly stops trying to read the disc.\nThe only thing I can think to do now is go into OpenFirmware (I do this by pressing one of the buttons below Power), but I haven't found a solution that works here. I might try booting from the CD, but if the CD didn't show up in the Recovery mode, I doubt it would show up in OpenFirmware.\nWhile in OpenFirmware, I went and entered a few commands, as advised by @Allan.

Also, it doesn't have \"Recovery\", which is a menu for accessing Disk Utility and Installing the OS - it just has a choice of boot options when you hold Alt.\nYou can force it to boot from the DVD by holding down C.\nYou can boot into OpenFirware with Command Alt O F, if memory serves.\nSome useful info about Open Firmware is here:\nhttp://macos9lives.com/smforum/index.php?topic=1965.0\nAnother possibility is a FireWire external drive, but that might be difficult to configure if this is your only Mac.\nIf the hard drive and DVD both won't boot, then I'd say the problem is further up the chain. It could be the cables inside, or just old age.\n\nA: it's looking for a startup HD that isn't present.\nhold down OPTION at startup and choose your boot disk, then set the startup disk using system preferences -> startup disk.\nmake sure when you select the startup disk, its highlighted.\nzapping the PRAM before you do this is helpful.\nonboard battery may be dead - which means settings get lost when power to the system is interrupted.\n\nA: So after buying another Mac with some install discs, I have concluded that there was something wrong with the master HDD, as it would not allow me to install the new system over the old one unless I wiped that disk completely. So I have gone and done just that.\nI wish there was a way to do this without removing all data, but that doesn't seem to be the case. In any event, recovery/install discs are your friend and they saved me here. Huge thanks to everyone who helped out in this endeavor (especially Allan)!\n", "Q: CalDigit TS3+ dock station causes Kernel Panic (macOS 10.15.6) I've a CalDigit TS3+ dock station with a DisplayPort external 1080p monitor, 100 baseT Ethernet, Apple USB extended keyboard (yes, wired USB keyboard) and Logitech UniFi receiver (for MX Master 2S) connected on it. It runs fine after upgrading to firmware ver 44.1, until system update 10.15.6.\nThis work station is set in my office and I'd take my MacBook Pro (personal property) home every day. So every morning I wake up my laptop and plug one single cable to it, then I can bring everything to work.\nAfter updated to 10.15.6, USB 3.0 bus on CalDigits TS3+ are slow in response whenever plugging in. It would take about 5~10 seconds before the external keyboard/mouse set be responsive, and the situation is getting worse.\nSince two weeks ago, the USB 3.0 bus on TS3+ stopped working completely when plug in TS3+ thunderbolt 3 cable. The hardware report from \"About this Mac\" shows that both USB 3.0 bus on TS3+ are not detected at all. But other peripherals, including DisplayPort display and Ethernet, they all work normally. And if I plug all my USB peripherals (keyboard, UniFi, iPhone, flash drive) directly onto MacBook Pro type-C ports, they will work normally, too. This situation can only be fixed by system reboot.\nFurthermore: if I disconnect TS3+ from MacBook Pro when TS3+ USB bus going down, I'd get Kernel Panic after 10 seconds. And, this is very weird: there is no system crash log after rebooting from Kernel Panic. The system crash log in \"Report to Apple\" dialog is plain blank, and I could find nothing related to these KP events in Console.app. It's almost like \"pull the power plug abruptly\" on a desktop computer.\nThis situation does not happen every time but the rate is quite high, about 40% or so. And it needs not to have the laptop sleep overnight; sometimes I unplug my MacBook Pro for a meeting and reconnect after returning to my desk, and it will also trigger the problem.\nI've tried to do NVRAM/SMC reset and, as expected, not working at all.\nCan anyone give me advice ? I'd also considering replace the dock to a different model, but I'm not sure whether it's the problem of macOS or dock.\n\nA: This may not be applicable however the bundled support and drivers for the TS3+ available at https://downloads.caldigit.com/ contain a kext called CalDigitThunderboltStationChargingSupport.kext found under /Library/Extensions/\nThis seemed to be the root cause of all my issues once this was removed I was able to restart & shutdown without issue for the past 4 weeks without issue.\nthe documented removal process can be found at https://archive.caldigit.com/KB/index.asp?KBID=142&viewlocale=1\nIf you have installed this it may be the cause of your issues.\nI have held off responding until I had a significant amount of time without the issue re-occouring before commenting.\n\nA: CalDigit guys confirmed this issue and apparently they’ve no idea what’s going on. They insisted that this only happens to MacBook Pro 13” 2020 as they have “never received report from 16-inch owner”, and they “believe” this will be fixed in Big Sur.\nSo I dumped this junk and get a Targus dock, and happy ever after.\n\nA: I suffered frequent kernel panics on connecting or disconnecting a CalDigit TS3+ to my 2019 16\" MBP with macOS 11. I updated the TS3 firmware to 44.1 with no effect. I didn't have the Thunderbolt charging kext to remove. The SMC reset had no effect, and I was unwilling to perform the NVRAM reset for likely no benefit. But I noticed that there never seemed to be anything related to CalDigit drivers in the panic report list after the reboot, and the idea that gave me now seems to have been quite reliable (after a few dozen dock/undock events). I believe the root of the problem is a race condition in the graphics drivers for this hardware -- it was never a problem with my older MBP.\nMy workaround is to avoid the condition of simultaneously connecting or disconnecting two external displays via the dock. I have one plugged into the TS3's DP port and the other via a USB-C to DP adapter. So before connecting the TS3 to the MBP, I now ensure that the USB-C to DP adapter is disconnected. I plug in the TS3, wait a few seconds, then plug in the second screen to the TS3. When disconnecting, reverse the steps. It's not as pleasant as the single cable promise of a dock, but it has been rock solid for me after a great deal of frustration over the panics.\n\nA: Well, I'll add my 2019 Macbook Pro 15 to the list of non-2020 13\" models experiencing the \"kernel panic\". All of my essential extensions are blocked if I attempt to boot up with the TS3+ plugged into my laptop, if it boots at all. Most often, even if I plug it in AFTER a successful boot, it immediately triggers a restart that sends me to the decidedly dead link \"support.apple.com/startup\" for assistance. I can't get my system to bootup at all, and I too have experienced intermittent boot passes that immediately launch a stack of \"extension blocked\" error windows along with the \"kernel panic\" warning.\nI'm running the latest TS3+ firmware, that was released for Catalina to support 87W charging. If they needed to flash new firmware for Catalina, not exactly sure why they're dumbfounded by this issue if they haven't fully tested the Catalina firmware for Big Sur--especially since Big Sur has substantially retooled architecture compared to its predecessor.\nThis needs to be addressed by CalDigit. They clearly need to update their firmware, because otherwise my computer functions absolutely fine.\n\nA: After I installed Ventura my mac went from the occasional Kernel Panic to crashes all the time when dual monitors are plugged in via the TS3+, and just switching the monitors on or off was a lottery: it might crash, freeze for a few minutes, or be fine.\nWhat fixed it for me was deleting the Colour profiles:\nEntirely clear this folder:\n/Library/ColorSync/Profiles\n\nWipe this file (the * is a long random hex string):\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.*.plist\n\n\n\n*Shut down the computer & restart.\n\n*Profit\n\n", "Q: Struggling to troubleshoot permanently crashing Dock, Mission Control, Launchbar Background: I need help troubleshooting this very bizarre bug that I can't figure out. This is on macOS 10.15.6 (before and after the most recent supplementary update) on a 2020 16\" MBP. The only thing I could think of that changed right before this issue occurred is I was playing around with BitBar and some BitBar plugins, but the issue persists regardless of BitBar being running/quit or even BitBar being completely uninstalled.\nThe Bug: The Dock is gone, the process is not showing up in Activity Monitor, and it is unable to be restarted or even quit using killall Dock (shows up as a no matching process error). Additionally, CMD+TAB does not work, and the same permanently dead process is happening for Launchpad and Mission Control. Neither of them run when called from Spotlight, nor do they show up in activity monitor, nor can they be killed using killall.\nTroubleshooting Thus Far: I've tried killall and some of the defaults write terminal commands floating around on the internet for killing/restarting these processes. I've tried poking around Activity Monitor for clues, and the Force Quit menu (relaunched Finder from there too just in case). I've rebooted, installed the most recent Catalina Supplementary Update, reset PRAM/NVRAM. I also cannot find anyone with the same issue anywhere on the internet, asked around on Reddit, and these are the closest I could find to my issue despite them not being the same and the solutions not working for me: SO1, SO2\n\nA: Very Long Story Short\nBitBar script for automatically changing desktop background somehow got run without my intent and set my desktop background image to a broken URL string. My desktop background was black so there was no visual change that alerted me to this being the culprit, but looking through ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/, I catted everything inside it just in case and turns out that desktoppicture.db was not gibberish but instead a URL.\nThis had the effect of keeping the Dock process stuck in limbo, where I could not kill or run it, nor could I actually witness it in any system diagnosis or crash report. It never crashed but it also wasn't running; a ghost.\n", "Q: LaunchAgents runs Python script in version 2 Maybe someone can explain this. I'm having LaunchAgents run a Python script on startup. The relevant part of the plist looks like:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>python</string>\n    <string>/Volumes/path to script\n\nThis launches the script in python2, despite the fact that \"python\" points to python3:\n/usr/local/bin/python -> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3.8\n\n…which errors because launchd is running a python3 script in python2. To fix it I had to specify python3:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>python3</string>\n    <string>/Volumes/\n\nAm I doing this right? Is python2 coded into launchd somewhere? Is there a reason I still need to specify python3?\n\nA: As mentioned in the comments, you can use full paths in the XML, e.g.:\n<string>/usr/local/bin/python</string>\n\nlaunchd isn't aware of environmental variables, like $PATH, unless explicitly set in the XML, so python would default to /usr/bin/python.\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/111391/use-an-environment-variable-in-a-launchd-script\n", "Q: Firefox keeps opening on wrong screen I use a 4K monitor as my main monitor, with my laptop off to one side.  Nearly every app I open opens correctly on the 4K monitor.\nBut Firefox always opens on the laptop monitor, even when its windows were on my 4K monitor when closed.  Also, when I make a new window in Firefox, it opens on the laptop monitor (even when all existing Firefox windows are in the 4K monitor).  Needless to say, this is very annoying.\nHow can I configure Firefox (or my Mac OS) to correctly open new windows on the 4K monitor like all other apps do?\nThis is on Mac OS 10.11.6 and Firefox 78.1.0esr.\n\nA: It seems that the key setting to resolve this is \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application.\"\nWith that box CHECKED, new windows open where I expect them to.\nClosing Firefox with two windows open both on my 4K display and then reopening Firefox, now reopens one window on the built-in display and one window on the 4K display, which is weird.  I may post further updates if I figure out why or figure out how to resolve that.  But having NEW windows open on my 4K display (as they now do) reduces the annoyance factor by a LOT.\n\nA: The following Firefox bug may explain the first half of your question. If you use a second monitor and don't use \"Displays have separate Spaces\", then opening Firefox will erroneously restore all windows to the current Space (virtual desktop) instead of back to where they were when you quit.\nYou can vote on this bug using your GitHub account here.\n", "Q: How can I set system-wide grayscale with exception of some apps? Does anyone know how to enable system-wide Grayscale with the exception of some user chosen Apps, which would have colors?\n\nA: This cannot be done.\nGreyscale in Accessibility is in effect an 'overlay' or filter for the entire screen. It is done right at the point the image is sent to be drawn by your GPU.

Creating the first backup over the network (with ~1TB of data) will be painfully slow.\nI've already created a backup using Time Machine on the drive mounted via USB, however this is a Backups.backupdb folder structure, not a backupbundle disk image that Time Machine uses when working over the network.\nIs there a way to create/convert a new backupbundle file with the Backups.backupdb folder such that I don't have to run a first full backup over the network? Alternatively, is there a way to convince Time Machine to use the backupbundle structure when backing up over USB?\n\nA: While I haven't tried this personally, I recently came across a workaround posted on the MacRumors forums that claims it should work:\n\nThere is a work around to do this. Attach the drive to the router\n(assuming it supports Time Machine) then start a backup to the disk\nusing Time Machine. Give it a couple minutes to get started, then stop\nit and disconnect.\nNow attach the drive to the Mac over USB. Look in Finder and you will\nsee a sparse bundle with the partial Backups.backupdb file there. Just\ndelete that file and empty the trash.\nNow turn on Time Machine and do a full backup. When it is done you\nwill have the full Backups.backupdb on the drive. Just move that from\nthe root of the drive into the sparse bundle. Now connect it back to\nthe router and turn TM back on. It will pick up where it left off with\nincremental backups going forward.\n\nAnother variation on this method creates a local Samba file share mount on the USB drive as a workaround. Full details in the linked answer, but a summary snippet follows:\n\nsudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2/32\nPlug your usb drive, then via System Preferences / Sharing add a smb share to a folder time-machine-macbook in the drive time-machine-usb Then, add a destination backup (Time Machine will see it as a network share)\nsudo tmutil setdestination -a \"smb://user:password@127.0.0.2/time-machine-macbook\"\n\nIf there is a simpler/more direct way to do it though, that would be awesome to know! I was thinking maybe something in the tmutil command line program may be able to do it, but haven't yet tried.\nAccording to Apple's Disk Utility User Guide, it appears possible to manually create a sparsebundle disk image:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Disk Utility app  on your Mac, choose File > New Image > Blank Image\n\n*Enter a filename for the disk image, add tags if necessary, then\nchoose where to save it.\n\n*In the Name field, enter the name for the disk image.\n\n*In the Size field, enter a size for the disk image.\n\n*Click the Format pop-up menu, then choose the format for the disk:\n\n*\n\n*I believe for Time Machine you will need to choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) (reference)\n\n\n\n*To encrypt the disk image, click the Encryption pop-up menu, then\nchoose an encryption option.\n\n*Click the Partitions pop-up menu, then choose a partition layout.\n\n*Click the Image Format pop-up menu, then choose an option:\n\n*\n\n*Sparse bundle disk image: Same as a sparse disk image (below), but the\ndirectory data for the image is stored differently.

Uses the .sparseimage file\nextension.\n\n\n\n*Click Save, then click Done.\n\n*Disk Utility creates the disk image file where you saved it in the\nFinder and mounts its disk icon on your desktop and in the Finder\nsidebar.\n\n*In the Finder, copy your files to the mounted disk image, then eject\nit.\n\n\nEdit Note: macOS Catalina appears to use the extension backupbundle instead of sparsebundle, but it seems that this file is still mountable in the same ways as previously.\n", "Q: EFI Boot doesn't work when trying to boot windows from my Mac 2 years ago, I installed Windows on a external SSD to be booted from my Mac.

Picture this:\nIt's 2 am, I'm coding, got XCode, a Browser, a Terminal... running and want to call it a day. I know very well that the next thing I'm doing on my MacBook is exactly where I left off, so with the same windows, tabs etc.\nMy question is:\nIs it good practice to close all my applications before I put my MacBook to sleep (not shut down, just sleep)?\nI've found an old post where they discussed this, regarding the time it takes to wake up your MacBook and get back to work. But what I want to know is, if leaving applications open drains my battery, or if it has any bad effects on my device over the long term.\nThanks\n\nA: \n...what I want to know is, if leaving applications open drains my battery, or if it has any bad effects on my device over the long term.\n\nYes, it drains your battery, but it uses a fraction of energy than when awake.  When your Mac goes to sleep, it suspends all of your applications in their current state in memory meaning that (CPU) processing and disk activity have all been stopped, but the application state is in memory being supported by battery - so yes, your battery will drain.\nHowever, when your Mac goes into hibernation it will write those saved states to a sleep image in which your Mac is all but turned off.  If the battery drains completely, the memory states though lost in RAM are preserved in the sleep image.\nFor more information, see Use sleep and Energy Saver on your Mac\n\nor if it has any bad effects on my device over the long term.\n\nWhy would it?  Whether your Mac is fully operational and memory is being utilized versus in sleep mode where memory is also being utilized, there’s nothing that the latter condition is going to do to “have bad effects on your device over the long term.”   Memory just holds values and when you get down to it, it's simply holding on or off states (the 1s and 0s) representing values.\nWhether it’s holding a spreadsheet, an photo, an animation, or the state of your application, it affects the memory no differently.  It doesn’t matter if your CPU is doing things with that memory or it’s in a static state, it doesn’t have adverse effects to your computer - it’s doing what it’s designed to do - hold on/off states representing values so long as there’s power.  In fact, an argument can be made that computer that’s awake causes more “wear” on one that’s asleep or hibernating.\nBottom line, the sleep/hibernate function has been used on all computers - Windows, macOS, and BSD/Linux alike across many different architectures like X86, ARM, RISC, SPARC and PowerPC - it’s a mature technology that works very well.  It’s designed to be a convenience feature that has no detrimental effects to your system.\n\nA: Just close the lid. Everything will be there when you come back tomorrow morning.\n\nA: Most of the time I will close many applications when going to sleep or traveling with the laptop.  I find that Apple Mail (when using Exchange Email Server) does not connect again all the time.  So I quit mail every time when traveling from work to home.\nSome other applications I will close as well, anything that is easy to resume or reconnect.\nMy Macbook has 32GB of RAM and with everything open for work I am pushing that limit of RAM and the CPU does not seem to keep up all the time, so sleeping with everything running does not work as well as I wish.\nI do leave Safari and Chrome running while in sleep and they have probably over 100 tabs and multiple Windows open. This seems to work for me.  However they need a restart once in a while as well.\nI do close down:  Apple Mail, Microsoft Office tools, Remote Desktop, TeamViewer, and many others.\nLike Steve commented, \"Best practice is to use the Mac the best way it works for you. \"\n", "Q: iTunes download stopped on Mac unexpectedly As you can see in the image below, the downloads are stopped.

There is more info at the link.\nApple TV apps should feel natural and intuitive. Users should instinctively know what to do and where they are at all times. Use the provided layout grids, keep the text legible at a distance, and avoid cluttering your interface with unnecessary visual adornments.\nApple TV uses a focus model for navigation. People use the remote to move through interface elements such as movie posters, apps, or buttons, highlighting each item as they come to it. An element is considered focused or in focus when the user highlights the item but has not clicked it. Make it clear at a distance when something is in focus. Implement expected button behavior so it’s impossible to get lost during navigation—clicking an item with the remote takes you deeper into an app’s hierarchy, pressing Menu always takes you back.\nThere is much more info at the link above.\n\nA: There’s so much documentation it’s hard to choose. I like the developer app and watching some WWDC videos to get my bearings. Then dive in to the official documentation.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/tvos/\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\n", "Q: No signal to external monitor until after login (MacBook Pro 2020) My external monitor works fine but only after I log in using the MacBook display. Prior to logging in it sends no signal. Once logged in, it suddenly starts receiving signal and works exactly as expected.\nThe cable connecting it to my display is a USB-C to HDMI.\nHow can I make it work correctly before logging in?\n\nA: \nHow can I make it work correctly before logging in?\n\nIt is working correctly.  Your built in screen is the main screen and during boot all boot/console messages are sent (they’re usually hidden by the Apple logo).  The login screen is set to display on the main screen so until you login to the GUI, there’s nothing to display on the secondary display.\nBut, based on your comments, what you want to do is use your Mac in closed lid or closed clamshell mode:\n\nI have the displays mirrored so I was hoping to see the logon screen. The MacBook sits at the back of my desk partially hidden by the external monitor and I use the external monitor as my main screen so it’s a little inconvenient that I have to move it to see the screen better just to log in\n\nIf the display is partially hidden/obstructed and you have the contents mirrored and not as an extended display, this is a perfect scenario to use the Mac in closed clamshell mode.  The secondary/external display will become the main display and boot and login screens will appear there.\n", "Q: Is there a way to delete or remove my apple email address completely from my apple iCloud account Looking for a way to keep my apple account but remove my iCloud email address from being active or able to receive emails in any manner.

Does this mean \"Applications\" == Discord?\nAlso, the question about what this grants access to is indeed explained: this does(!) grant the application(s) access to all keystrokes whether using that app or other apps! (it's not clear whether the app has to be open for the keystrokes to be collected).\n\nUpdate 2\nI read this it's well known discord asks to access (all) keystrokes for it's 'Push to Talk' feature\n\nA: I would not allow it under most circumstances. This permission is potentially allowing a keystroke logger to run on your Mac. A keystroke logger is a form of malware that can monitor your activities through listening to what you press on your keyboard.\nThis can be a very serious security issue as they can potentially \"listen\" to you as you put in your passwords and then compromise your accounts, such as a bank account or email password.\nThe only circumstance I can think of to warrant this is if you are installing accessibility hardware(think like for a blind person) which requires more info.\nI once allowed this permission for logitech's app so they could custom remap the butons on my mouse. I found this acceptable, because in order to provide the functionality it offered, it did need to listen to my keystrokes across all my apps. I remapped the keys so pressing the mouse side button opened mission control.\nWhenever this or another dialog pops up, think, does this app really need/use the feature it's asking for, or is it spying on me, data mining me so it can sell my data, and/or hacking my accounts?\nMacOS protects your security with these dialogs and if you enable access to apps you are bypassing these valuable security features. However, if you are trying to run an internet phone app, it will need access to your microphone to function. Security is about balancing needed app permissions while also only granting the minimum access a specific app needs.\nHowever, in this instance, I would not allow it. A request from \"Application\" looks like malware to me.\n", "Q: Check for available app downloads on Apple TV Several months ago I bought Sonic the Hedgehog (1) on iOS and was very happily surprised to see it appear on my 4th gen Apple TV also.

Is it possible to do this from App Store Connect alone?\n\nA: No, you cannot do this without resubmitting the app.\nHowever, you do not actually need to rebuild the app using Xcode, as you otherwise indicate. If you look at the application bundle, you find the icons are usually stored in Contents/Resources/.icns. You can edit that file to change the icon. There's no need to rebuild the actual app executable.\nIf you're working with a signed app, you'll need to run the codesign program to resign the app.\n", "Q: WD Blue SSD stuck in a boot loop My Mac is stuck in a boot-loop with a third party SSD.\nSo I recently pruchased a WD Blue 500GB SSD to replace my HDD in my 13\" MBP mid-2012.\nAt first I wanted to clone my HDD to the SSD, looked up a tutorial on iFixit and then followed  the procedure.

How does the carrier company know which method I'm consuming that data?\n\nA: You will want to confirm with your carrier, but it won’t matter if you connect via browser or via the app.\nRemember, the owner of any network knows what IP address, thus what customer, connects to which server and how much data is transferred to/from that connection.  This is just looking at it from the most basic perspective and not taking into account that there are tools that can detect the type of content being transferred.\nThey know that your IP is connected to a YouTube server regardless if you use the app or browser and won’t throttle/count the data from those servers against your monthly allotment.\nThe reason I recommend contacting your carrier is because they may have an agreement with YouTube that stipulates using the app for the unlimited data (i.e. you can’t block adds or better tracking, etc.). So technically, it doesn’t matter; they know how much YouTube data you consume; it may be a contractual (business) issue that requires you to use the app.\n", "Q: Attach 15-inch Macbook pro screen (with broken logic board) to 21-inch iMac (with broken screen)? I am curious to know if I can take the screen from my Macbook Pro (15-inch, 2010) and somehow use it as a display for an iMac (21-inch, 2012) either through a direct connection to the logic board's display pins or via the mini display port.  The logic board is dead on the laptop and the screen is dead on the desktop, so between them, maybe I can have one functional computer.\n\nA: No. The internal connectors are incompatible between the two; different size and different pin-outs. And there is no functional way to route the display signal through the mini Displayport from one to the other.\n\nA: \nI am curious to know if I can take the screen from my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2010) and somehow use it as a display for an iMac (21-inch, 2012) either through a direct connection to the logic board's display pins or via the mini display port.\n\nYes, you can.  However, it's not a direct connection or a simple case of getting an LVDS cable long enough to go from the logic board on the iMac to the 15\" display.\nYou need a LCD Controller Board specific to that LCD panel.  There are a lot of DIY instructions on how to do this very thing, but to summariaze, here's what you'll need:\n\n*\n\n*The exact model of the LCD panel (you'll have to dissasemble the display) because you'll need the model number and connector info it when ordering the LCD controller board and cables\n\n\n*The LCD controller board itself.\n\n*\n\n*HDMI or DisplayPort (or both).\n\n*LVDS cable(s)\n\n*Inverter board (if necessary).  Depends on if you have an LED or CCFL display\n\n\n\n*Some sort of housing or stand for your display.\nIf you're going to do this, you'll likely have to custom build an enclosure for your screen - likely in a form factor of a picture frame or shadow box because you'll need somewhere to mount both the panel and the controller board as well as have a sturdy place to mount the control buttons (i.e. power button) and cut outs for your display inputs (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, etc.)  I also recommend going with DisplayPort as you won't need an adapter to go from the DisplayPort out from the iMac.\nIs this worth it?\nNo.  You're better off finding used display panels for both machines.  In fact, it's cheaper to buy a low spec monitor for the MacBook Pro and use that as a desktop in closed clam shell mode.  The displays for the 21\" Late 2012 iMac can still be found on eBay or you can part out the machine as it has excellent salvage value.\nI recommend repurposing displays only if you have a custom application like a Raspberry Pi project or similar.  The cost and effort is much more than what you can source replacement parts for.\n", "Q: How many hard drives are in this Mac mini? I just purchased a Mac mini and the seller assures me that there are two 1 TB hard drives inside, with a total storage space of 2 TB (picture from the listing).\nAt first, I was under the impression that there was a second drive without an OS and that the partitioning was done on that (Windows-format?) drive. However, after erasing the accessible drive following Apple's instructions, and restoring my data with Target mode, I do not see a second drive listed anywhere:\n\n*\n\n*If I start the computer pressing ALT I see\nthis.\n\n*In the Storage tab I see\nthis.\n\n*In Recovery mode the Disk\nUtility lists this.\n\n*The diskutil list command returns this in\nRecovery mode (more images).\n\nI really, really don't want to have to go through this process to figure out if the seller is saying the truth about there being two drives inside, since it might prevent me from returning it, but I'd like to know if what I bought matches the item description.\nPossible hypotheses:\n\n*\n\n*there is no second drive\n\n*there might be a second drive, but badly connected/wired in so undetectable\n\n*there is a second drive that is blank / oddly formatted / undetectable\n\nHow can I know if there is a second drive in the Mac mini?\n\nA: You have one drive.\nYour diskutil list command tells you everything you need to know:  there's only one entry that has a \"physical\" characteristic to it and it's disk0.\nWhen you boot into Recovery, there are many RAM disks that get created and in your case they are disk1 through disk19.  If you notice on each identifier, it describes it as a \"disk image\" as in the example below:\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +2.1 GB     disk1\n   1:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        2.0 GB     disk1s1\n\nWhat you want to look for is anything that says \"internal, physical\" because if the seller assured you \"there are two hard drives,\" you would have (in a Mac mini) two identifier with \"internal, physical\" descriptors like that of disk0:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nWhat the seller showed you was a (Bootcamp) partition.  When booted, the partitions appear to the OS as their own separate drives.\n\nA: Possibilities are:\n\n*\n\n*There is no second drive\n\n*There is a second drive that is undetectable because faulty or badly connected\n\nYou can find out which it is by simply opening the black plastic bottom and looking, no \"process\" required.\n\nIn the picture of what you will see when opening the back, I have indicated the two connectors for the two possible disks with red arrows. One will already be occupied by the disk we know is in the Mac mini. If the other one is also occupied, then it is the second alternative: there is a disk but it is faulty or the connection is faulty. If it is unoccupied there is no second disk inside.\n", "Q: Why is sysdiagnose constantly running? Every ten minutes or so sysdiagnose hogs all my CPU cores.

Products fail - it happens.  You're just lucky enough that it happened during the \"return to retailer\" period (usually 30 days) and not when the warranty runs out 48 weeks from now.\n\nA: Before submitting them for repair or replacement to Apple, I would make sure you have thoroughly unpaired them from every device (laptop, phone, everything) and reset them one more time to clear any possible Bluetooth cache issues.

Originally I set these up with an admin user with the same username and password on all devices, and I used this to admin parental controls on them.\nThis has become an issue when the shared password was compromised.\nIdeally the admin password on all family devices would have a managed password, and I could change the login password on all devices from one place.\nIs it possible to achieve this functionality somehow?  Perhaps there's a iCloud Family feature I'm missing?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you've discovered the perils of having a single password for multiple devices/accounts. This would be no different than if it were an IT Manager who used the same firmware PIN and admin credentials across all school computers (I say that, because I inherited that exact problem).\nApple ID doesn't haven anything to manage this and \"corporate\" style solutions like network authentication or mobile device management is simply overkill for what you need to do.  So, the solution is to use a different password for the admin account for each Mac and store them in a good password manager.\nI use KeepassXC for this purpose.  My personal stuff (like bank accounts and website logins) is stored on a different service, but passwords for my \"infrastructure\" is stored here.  All my routers, switches, servers, etc. are stored in KeePass.  KeePass is secure.  If you lose the master password, you're not getting into to it - ask me how I know.\nBy having a tool to manage your passwords and using different credentials for each device, any \"breach\" is contained and you don't compromise the rest.\n", "Q: give another user permissions on folder, but not on parent folders I would like to give another member of my household (who has access to my computer and has an account on it) access to a particular folder & its contents.

But is this a robust solution, might their access via their Finder sidebar vanish ?  It seems to survive reboot, but what about other things such as an OS update ?\n\nA: I would put that folder into the Shared Folder as that way there is no possibility of them getting into other folders.\nYou can always keep a backup of that same folder in your home directory.\n", "Q: MacBook-pro Internal PCIe Samsung 512g SSD no longer recognized on MBP (mid 2015 15\" A1398) after crash and hard reset Short version: Need help finding, diagnosing and fixing the internal factory installed Samsung SSD that has vanished after hard reset. Trying to retrieve data or avoid data loss with whatever options there are.\n[Before I start I have links at bottom that may be similar problems that a more knowledgable person may be able to utilise to help here I am not sure.]\nI think this may be a similar fix with this:\n(I will post link later so it is not considered Spam)\nalthough the problems/causes are not the same.\nSo to begin: After a hard reset I found a flashing folder meaning no bootable drive. I was using High Sierra or later OS --I say later because am not sure what my last recent upgrade was if it was to later version High Sierra, Mojave, or Catalina but it was fairly recent and I had High Sierra before that for sure; so APFS was almost surely on the SSD format. I expect this solely from having High Sierra in use, which I had for a while.\nI had no troubles but then had the OS freeze on Safari or chrome web stuff with multiple folders left open. I had maybe about 50G of space left on the SSD at the time of freeze. so I did a hard reset here (Just holding the power button to shut off) when I know I should have waited. Upon reboot I saw a dreaded flashing folder. Booting in recovery mode with only the internal SSD in (internet was required) I found that the factory Samsung internal SSD was not recognized--Only Disk0 and base OS X in Disk utility and Diskutil list from terminal. When trying to reload the OS from here (internet recovery) no disk or Hard drive/SSD was recognized. This is when I started learning about computers-- quick, and the importance of back-ups and stuff... Foolishly I did not have back up, and I must Say that I had just bought 2 San disks here to create back ups but I just never got to it. So the system froze up before I got to securing my data.\nAnyway here I forget the exact order I did things and I should have written that down-- I know I did SMC reset. And the Boot into recovery--But the drive was not there to do anything that is recommended such as reinstalling the OS or doing first aid on the drive. I eventually put 2 different working OS-- [Catalina and Sierra] on two different external drives and also created a bootable drive on another hd.\nSo rationalizing-- did the hard reset mess with the drive during a super important root process? Did I get my partitions messed up as well?..From an improperly unmounted SSD? Was Bootloader or EFI boot loader locations scrambled?\nI imagine that I must do the same thing as in another post: disable SIP and run some non intrusive fsck commands (get GPT FDisk as well??) to find out or fix stuff. But I am not sure and I need pro help to run any modifying commands for sure.\nI have scoured the support forums, but then got on here and this one seems quite intense--many with greater experience here who can help build up the resource.\nI am trying to recover the drive so I can extract data and make use of the drive; or clone/copy the drive, then just reformat the SSD if that is safest? Make the SSD safe for use and I would keep all data on external drives ( I now have 3) this would be ideal. But another great outcome would be if the drive is mountable so I can at least access and extract the data I need, and go from there.\nSo what else to relate:\nI can load into recovery mode (cmd + r) (cmd+Opt+R) both of which go into internet recovery.\nI have 3 sandisks; (1 with Catalina, 1 with Sierra and one with data); and one toshiba drive with a sierra bootloader\nIn disk utility in recovery mode (with only the damaged/mixed drive in) I am only able to see Disk0 and OS X base system. Installing OSX from here (on external drive) yields the first OS X on this 2015 MBP which was Yosemite but no option there to show all devices in disk utility; in the view menu now in Sierra I ensure ‘Show all devices’ is enabled, and still no volume name for that which I would expect to see ‘Macintosh HD’ or SSD whatever it is named And I know I did the same in Catalina.\nI contacted official Apple support (online), and once I explained that reseting SMC and PRAM didn't work and that I could see no drive names listed under my internal SSD, the girl mostly began talking about getting service for the hardware. So I later put Catalina on one of the external drives and system is running fine. (I am using Sierra now though on a different external drive) But still need to fix issue with internal drive and retrieve data.\nI sincerely thought that if I could just put an AFPS system on the mac that it would be able to read the SSD... No\nCannot try Target disk mode on another Mac, I do not have one; I have a very old pc; but I would be blowing dust off of that so I doubt it can help.\nInternet recovery mode works and safe mode but if I put in the internal SSD things seem to go real slow, and hot.\nRecovery mode Disk Utility on the Internal SSD -- First Aid cannot be used as no disk is found\nThanks in advance for any help and time put forth.\n-Will sleep now so apologies if I delay in any quick responses from the forum...\nThanks for reading!\nAny more info needed?\nMBP retina A1398 ...\n2.2  ghz intel i7...\n16gb 1600MHz DDR3...\n15.4 inch mid 2015...\nBoot ROM 199.0.0\nSMC 2.29f23 ...\nModel identifier 11,4..\nSSD model info:\n[Samsung Model MZ-JPV2560/0A4\n256GB SSUBX 655-1858F  2015.04]\nMacBook Pro 15″, OS X 10.10 (installed)\n\nA: The 15\" MBP Retina Mid 2015 MacBookPro11,4 (A1398) is at most 5 years old.  All drives fail, it is merely a matter of when. You have learned a valuable lesson about backups. It is interesting that Recovery Mode boots from the internal SSD or is that from an external drive?  I suspect the latter but your description jumps around so much it's hard to tell.\nWhile booted from an external drive if you open Terminal and run the diskutil list command do you see the internal physical drive /dev/disk0 listed with the EFI, Apple_Boot, Recovery?  If not, then the drive is definitely not being seen at all. You could try booting from various macOS installer versions (Yosemite, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina) on a flash thumb drive and run the Terminal and the diskutil list command on each. As the file systems vary from JHFS+ to APFS.\nAt this point you should probably just replace the internal SSD with a new SSD which fortunately is possible on this model of MacBook Pro. Newer MacBook Pros have the SSD soldered to the system board but not your model.\nIf you cannot see the drive at all is a clear indicator that the SSD has completely failed. If after replacing the SSD you cannot see the new drive then the system board has a failure.  If it was merely a messed up core storage conversion to APFS or other soft failure of the data organization on the disk, it would still show up as a drive. It would appear even if nothing was on the drive.\nYou can send the SSD out to a data recovery company to take a crack at recovering data but it can be very expensive. It may require removing the flash chips and placing them in a special rig using very specialized software to read every sector bypassing the drives firmware. Then more software to decode various layers of core storage and JHFS+ or APFS formatting.  Even then you might receive back a jumbled mess of partial data. The more effort involved in recovery the more it costs.  When SSDs fail there is often no warning unlike mechanical HDD drives which make noises, report failures, etc.\nBut sadly, you will not find any magic bullet software to fix/repair a drive that is not being detected. At that point, your options require significant tooling and skill to access the flash chips directly. If it was encrypted you need to supply the recovery key to the data recovery specialists.\n\nA: I would probably take the drive from the mac so you can test the drive in isolation. It seems there’s so much history and effort to fix this with the drive in, it’s time to simplify your challenge.\nOnce you have the drive in another controller - you can recover the data or know the drive is in fact failed and seek professional data recovery.\nJames has the other brilliant idea - just bring an external drive to the mac in question and see if you can install an OS on an external drive - if you can’t do that, you know your mac needs repair, so it’s more urgent to get the drive out once you do that experiment.\n", "Q: Mac book air Admin account slower than fresh brand new user account — I have tried a lot to fix I have a Mac book air 2017 running Catalina.

The OS works fine: only the user account is affected.\nSome may suggest packing up and moving to a new user account. The trouble is that if you keep doing this every time you come up with a user-account problem, you'll have a succession of different user accounts, which may cause problems with backups, file ownership attributions, etc. And you'll be none the wiser.\nThe cause is something in the user's Library folder. It could be third-party software that's set to launch at startup, so test by disabling ALL of that. Don't leave any 'necessary' stuff.\nYou've deleted the entire user Preference folder, which is overkill.

Hand migrating back only the documents you need would get the tabula rasa / clean start you have accurately determined is the next step to a faster experience.\n\nYou would deselect everything except the user account “John Appleseed” in the sample image since you’re only deleting (or renaming) and importing the user, not the system.\nGood Luck! This is doable and you’ll know you can back up and restore once it’s done.\n\nA: Being slow refers to memory (CPU), not so much to storage or disk errors. Mac is a CPU-intensive OS because of Apple’s belief that ‘unused CPU is wasted CPU’. CPU is gobbled up by running apps, processes, agents, and utilities, especially by pesky 3rd party software (how I hate Adobe! It’s been eating at my CPU even after uninstalling their software, until I manually removed all Adobe’s hidden agents). Therefore, it’s only reasonable that a new account you created is faster - it has less apps, less processes running, less legacy agents and cache stored away in hidden folders.\nYou can hardly fix this without erasing stuff, but try at least uninstalling apps you don’t use, remove all but necessary browser extensions, don’t run more than one or two apps at a time without quitting them before you open other apps.\nTry some tricks from the following article, such as removing all Desktop files, disabling dock animation, removing all but main apps from your dock and using launchpad instead.\nhttps://uk.crucial.com/articles/mac-users/how-to-speed-up-your-mac-system\nUse Activity Monitor to track CPU-intensive processes. Quit unresponsive or processes that are using too much of your CPU, and be generally aware of what your system is doing. For example, if Siri is re-indexing your drive, you can write off a few hours - it’s a very CPU-intensive process and it’s best to just let it run (don’t lock the screen or power off) than to battle with it. If there are some agents that you don’t recognize and don’t need (always double check by googling so that you don’t quit essential native Apple agents), not only quit, but find them in your Library and bin them for good (like I did with multiple Adobe agents).\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac\nI’ve had the same issue and I also dreaded erasing my disk clean and reinstalling, but it’s not as painful as it seems when you store all your files in the cloud and so you only have to resync them once you reinstall. You could use a backup drive and this free app to easily back up your user folder, then fully erase your disk and reinstall macOS. Then you could transfer your user folder from your backup drive onto your newly installed drive, either all or only select folders (only applications to avoid finding and reinstalling your apps, or only library to preserve your settings).\nhttps://macdaddy.io/duplicate/\nBut I wouldn’t advice to backup anything. I would only use cloud (Dropbox or OneDrive) or an external drive to sync your files, everything else, start from a clean slate. What helped me is changing my thinking from “what I have to remove” to “what I have to keep”. Instead of going through all my files and deciding what to remove, I thought and selected what I absolutely have to keep. If I didn’t think about it, or if it’s been sitting there for two years but I never touched it, I don’t need it.\nSlow Mac is a struggle.

If you can boot to internet recovery, that also means you don’t need it.\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup - you may need to erase everything to fix this, so be ready now.\n\n*Boot to any recovery OS and reinstall your OS - this doesn’t delete anything but does overwrite the system and make a new OS install and migrate all your apps, data, settings to the new install.\n\nIf you decide you need this to be updated / perfectly clean, follow the erase install guide. You will need your backup since this deletes everything from your Mac:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496\n\nA: Sounds like the recovery partition is from Mavericks and very old. Best thing to do is backup your data using Time Machine or a clone tool such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper to an external drive.  Then create a bootable macOS installer for Catalina on an 8GB+ 12GB+ flash drive (prior to Catalina 8GB+ was sufficient).  Boot from that and delete everything off the internal drive of the Mac.  Then install Catalina and restore using /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant and point it to the backup drive.\nIn the past there were utilities and techniques to remove the recovery partition and recreate it.  But it's far cleaner and better to just backup everything then nuke and pave so to speak with a clean install. Those utilities exist but you won't get the latest recovery partition and the only time I used such a method was when I needed to recover a very old system that wasn't upgradable to the latest macOS.\nI would not restore from backup at the start of the installer as it might put things back to the way they were (restoring your Mavericks recovery partition) and you would be back at square one. The Migration Assistant should restore your Apps and data once you have a clean install of macOS and updates.  Then update your full backup to a new Time Machine backup drive or re-clone it at this point to ensure your backups have the new recovery partition.\nYou could also hold Option + CMD + R while powering on to use Internet Recovery to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac and nuke the internal drive completely.  But this requires unfiltered WiFi and a fast connection or it will take forever.  Burning a flash drive is faster even with the best WiFi / Internet speeds.\n\nA: There is a third-party utility, Recovery Partition Creator, that creates or updates the recovery partition on your startup disk.\nhttps://musings.silvertooth.us/downloads-2/\nYou also need a copy of the OS installer app.\n", "Q: Unable to install apps on iPhone, either free or paid I had an Apple ID in one country and was unable to update the debit card, which had the same currency and a different country address.\nNow I cannot install free or paid apps.

If I put the wrong one, I see:\nVerification failed\nYour Apple ID or password is incorrect\nCancel Try Again\n\nWhen the password is right, I see a spinning circle and then I see Get again, just as before.\nI tried this thread to sign in from my name in the Settings app. I get prompted for a different email address, to which I say no put my email and password, and nothing happens either. I changed the sign-in away from the other email, which was still connected to the Game Center (from Settings > Game Center), and tried signing in again with the same result.\nEverything seems to be in order with my Apple ID, which I can see on a desktop browser with my current country.\nHow can I install free or paid apps?\nI am using an iPod Touch with iOS 12.4.7.\n\nA: I contacted Apple for support and they were unable to explain why this happened. They suggested three things:\n\n*\n\n*reset network settings, then enter wi-fi settings again: this failed,\n\n*install the latest software version (12.4.8): this worked,\n\n*restore the iPod to factory settings: I did not try this.\n\nTo see if it works, I could either have signed in from the Settings app, which requests the password for my Mac computer, or to sign in from the App Store app.\n", "Q: How can I Access my files from a different start up disk I am have problems with a Mac not starting up (macOS 10.13.6, MacBookPro 13” early 2015)  I created a new start-up disk on an external hard drive and wanted to recover files before going further but the Files on my user account on my laptop are locked - even though I am using the same Apple ID, name and password.\n\nA: You'll need to add your user account to the folders and files using the Get Info (CMD + I). Unlock the gold lock and click the + add yourself with Read & Write permissions to each folder and the files within.\nSince that is quite tedious you can do it from the command line in an easier fashion.  Open Terminal and do the following:\n($ is the prompt for a normal user and # is the prompt for root or sudo elevated equivalent. You don't type the $ or # symbols)\n$ sudo -s (type your password when prompted)\n# chown -R <username>:staff /Volumes/<internal_disk_name>/Users/<username>\n\nIt will take a while for the ownership to cascade down all the files in your home directory on the internal disk. Let it run.  The -R means recursively drill down the entire tree of files and folders from your old home folder the whole way.  There are likely a great number of files to process.\nOnce it finishes go back to Finder and you should be able to copy your files to back them up.  Then you can delete everything on the internal disk and re-install the operating system and restore your data from the external disk.\n", "Q: How Can I Mount \"Macintosh HD - Data\" in the Finder in Target Disk Mode? I attempted to install the latest Catalina supplemental update on my 2019 iMac, however, after it downloaded and the Mac restarted it got stuck on the update screen, and it's been that way for 2 days.\nI tried restarting and resetting the parameter RAM, which didn't really do anything, and it won't boot into Safe Mode; the system restarts right back into the update screen.\nI booted up from an external drive running Catalina, hoping that I might be able to copy files to another external. I can see the Macintosh HD volume in the Finder, but not the Macintosh HD - Data volume, so I can't access my files.\nI then booted up an older iMac and put the 2019 iMac into Target Disk Mode, but it's basically the same problem: Macintosh HD - Data shows mounted in Disk Utility, but I don't see it in the Finder.\nSystem Integrity Protection is NOT enabled.\nAny suggestions on how to mount Macintosh HD - Data via Target Disk Mode or from an external drive?\n\nA: For those who might still have this problem when in target disk mode. Right click on the Macintosh HD - Data volume in Disk Utility and click \"show in finder\"\n\nA: I've seen this before, sometimes the updates hiccup and fail to bless the startup volume after an update.  So it keeps booting from the update volume and it fails because it already moved files and cannot locate them.\nYou should be able to boot into the internal drive Recovery Mode by holding CMD+R on power up.  (disconnect the external drive)\nThen see if you can get to the pull down menus in Recovery Mode and select Start Up.  Set your Macintosh HD as your start up volume and reboot.  It might just come back up all normal and nice like it's supposed to.\nShort of that fix, there could be something more complicated happening.  But I've performed this fix several dozen times over the last few years and it typically works. So try this first.  You did not say that Recovery Mode was not working.\nIf Recovery Mode on the internal disk does not boot, then when you power on the iMac while holding the T key that will put you into Target Disk mode.  Attach a thunderbolt data cable to another Mac and it should be able to mount the drive on the second Mac. If you encrypted the drives you may need to unlock them first.  You would only see the two distinct volumes (system & data) if you are looking at it from a lower level like the Terminal diskutil, etc. Finder will show it as only Macintosh HD.  In the Finder Preferences you can enable showing External drives on the sidebar and on the Desktop as Tetsuhin mentioned.\nBut seriously, try booting from Recovery Mode on the internal drive of the iMac with the problem and forcing the startup disk from the drop down (utilities) menu first.  That almost always works.\n", "Q: Mac Pro not booting after update Mac pro 2009 4,1 Boots up but no video output (black screen).\nIt was working fine on the old OS that was on it(not sure which OS). I want to update to the highest OS (el capitan) it can run. So I did. But after that I get an black screen.\nI tried to reset some things like time code, vram etc. Nothing works. Can't even go to the BIOS to reset everything (or I've got the wrong key combination).\nI have also added two other hdds. And on one of them was an Windows installation. So I hold the option key on startup to choose an other hdd and choose the Windows one. And that was just working fine.\nWhat can I do to run Mac OS again?

On a Mac that is compatible\nwith El Capitan, open the disk image and run the installer within,\nnamed InstallMacOSX.pkg. It installs an app named Install OS X El\nCapitan into your Applications folder. You will create the bootable\ninstaller from this app, not from the disk image or .pkg installer.\"\n\nI just attempted creating a bootable  on Catalina and when running the PKG it says it will not install on this Mac as it is not compatible.\nSo I attempted to work around that problem. I had to use CharlesSoft's Pacifist utility which allows the extraction of any type of Mac Package file format. Since I am a MacSysAdmin I have this utility already and it comes in handy all the time.  Unfortunately, it's not open source and it's not free. But for $20 shareware it does what it says it does and it does it very well.\nI was able to extract the PKG from the DMG:\nInstallMacOSX Folder\n  └──InstallMacOSX Folder\n       └──Install OS X El Capitan\n\nThen I moved \"Install OS X El Capitan\" to \"/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan\" and then I ran the El Capitan \"createinstallmedia\" command.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\n\nGuess What? That Does Not Work!\nI even tried using DiskMakerX ver 6 and ver 9 and it didn't work either. Stated my El Capitan was an incomplete download which it is not an incomplete download.\nSo back to the drawing board. I try it on Mojave instead. My Mac is dual boot Mojave / Catalina. So in Mojave, it still doesn't work.\nCopy it over to the High Sierra Mac.  Finally, some success. The DMG PKG file installed in /Applications/Install OS X El Capitan and I was able to burn a flash drive.\nIt Only Works on macOS High Sierra or older\nSo your options are to find someone with a High Sierra Mac or maybe you could install VirtualBox (free), Parallels, VMware Fusion and install High Sierra as a virtual machine then use that to burn an installer. FYI, it can be tricky to access a physical USB in a virtual machine.\nOnce you get it working, hang onto that working boot USB drive since it's such a terrific pain to build one!  The way the El Capitan createinstallmedia works, varies considerably from the newer macOS versions. It doesn't have the normal InstallESD.dmg, etc.\n", "Q: Terminal stuck at empty screen The terminal app is stuck on a window like the following and doesn't respond to\n\n*\n\n*Reopen,\n\n*File > Reset, hard reset.\n\n*Renaming .bash_profile and reopen.\n\n*Opening other profiles.\n\nLast time I used it, it was for a nodejs server.

The Cisco console cable is a serial cable, with a DB-9 on one end and an RJ-45 connector on the other - it’s not Ethernet.\nYou will need an application like screen (comes with macOS), Minicom or iTterm2  that allows you to connect to the serial console.  Most importantly, when you plug it into the router, you cannot plug it into any of the network ports - you need to plug it into the console port.\n\n", "Q: How to find tagged files/folders using the command line in Terminal?

I'm trying to put together a text-based PDF that will be read with a screen reader. In order to make the reading process as straightforward as possible I've used a hierarchy of three levels of headings. I originally created the document in Google Drive, but if I try to export a PDF from there all my headers disappear in the PDF document. If I export from Drive to Word then the headings are retained, but they disappear when I create a PDF from Word by using the built-in macOS PDF creation function.\nHow can I retain my headings when I create a PDF in macOS?\n\nA: In Word for Mac 2019 (Version 16.41 (20081900) if I go to File -> Save As and choose File Format PDF it displays an option, \"Best for electronic distribution and accessibility (uses Microsoft online service)\".  It then asked permission to use the online service.  When testing in macOS Preview the Table of Contents shows Heading Two and Three assuming Heading One is the title.  Setting an actual title with the title style now shows the Title and the 3 headings in the PDF table of contents.\nSo I think this will work without needing more advanced PDF tools such as Adobe Acrobat.\nYou might want to produce an actual Table of Contents in Word that might help as well but it wasn't necessary.  I just applied the Heading Styles in Word to the headings and made the body portions the normal style.\nAlso in Word there is \"Check Accessibility\" under the Tools menu.\nTested doing same in Pages and that produces a table of contents with the style headings as well in PDF.  But Word allowed for collapsing the headings while Pages generated the headings in a linear fashion in the table of contents.\n", "Q: Making changes to the iTerm UI permanent I am new to the MacOS, and I have started using iTerm2, and I want to make the changes to my UI permanent, but I am unable to do so.\nWhen I \"right-click\" in the iTerm window and go to Edit Session... → Preferences → Text → Cursor → Vertical Bar , my current instance of iTerm does what I want it to.\nHowever, when I shut it down and start another window some time later, it reverts back to its old settings. How do I make these settings permanent so I don't have to keep repeating the above process?\n\nA: \"Edit Session\" is exactly that - it edits that particular session.\nIf you want to make it permanent, you have to make the change in your profile.

(Thanks in advance for suggestions on how I could make my question clearer)\nContext:\nI have a team that uses a shared folder that we each auto-sync to our local machines. We use Google Drive and Google's Backup And Sync application to manage the syncing, but we could be using Box or Dropbox or any other cloud storage with auto-syncing.\nProblem:\nSome team members have had iCloud's \"Optimize Mac Storage\" feature enabled, which over the course of a couple of months has led to files in this shared folder being replaced with .icloud symlinks that don't work for anyone else on the team.\nFor example, let's assume shared-team-folder/ contains file1.pptx, file2.pptx, and file3.pdf.\nAt some point team member Bob's mac replaces syncs all three of those files to iCloud and replaces them with file1.pptx .icloud, file2.pptx .icloud, and file3.pdf .icloud placeholder files instead. Google Drive's Backup And Sync (or Box or Dropbox) shares Bob's changes to the cloud, which then get pulled down onto the computers of team members Alice and Carol.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*What procedure can I use to ensure that the files are safely restored back into the folder for all to use?\n\n*Will unchecking \"Optimize Mac Storage\" put the original files back?\n\n*If Alice, Bob, and Carol all have \"Optimize Mac Storage\" enabled, does the order in which they disable it matter?\n\n*Are there things we could do wrong in this process that could lead to the files being lost?\n\n\nA: Yes, it's a pickle to have two competing cloud drive sync's running on the same files.  You need to ensure that iCloud, Google, Dropbox, Box, etc. are not using the same locations.\niCloud sync's the Desktop and Documents folders so make sure none of the other competitor cloud drive sync folders are not located on the Mac desktop nor documents folders.\nI would have the problematic user disable the Google sync and download the documents from iCloud then move them to a new folder outside the Desktop or Documents folders.  Then ensure that the folder that Google uses to sync is also not in Desktop or Documents. Then enable the Google drive sync new location.  Move the files into Google drive sync folder and let them sync back to Google.  That should fix the problem once the other users sync them back down from Google.\nIf more than one user has turned on the iCloud Desktop & Documents sync feature they need to do the same thing. Except now someone has to figure out what's new versus old in regards to the files that have moved into individual iClouds over a period of time. So if that is the case, ouch... That's painful if it's a lot of files.\nDecide on a single cloud solution and stick to it. Do not mix your cloud solutions.  This sounds like an accident. So hopefully it was just one user who did this.\nCheck the Google drive that's on the Google Cloud see if the files were all replaced with .cloud links. If so then the master copy should be on that one users personal iCloud.\nOnce you've resolved the Google mess.  Then the user can either continue to use iCloud or they can turn off the Optimize feature, download all their files (if they have enough local storage) and then they can turn off the iCloud Desktop & Documents feature if they really don't want to use it.  Otherwise they need to keep other cloud systems outside the Desktop and Document folders.\n", "Q: Battery percentage is wrong and cannot wake from sleep, have to reboot a lot MacBook Pro early 2013 3 Ghz Inte Core i7 running Mojave 10.14.6. Bought it used from Mac of All Trades about one year ago. Six months ago I replaced the internal SSD with a 1 Tb Aura SSD from OWC and cloned over the original contents. Everything has been great, no issues at all.\nStarting about four days ago, I opened the clamshell to wake from sleep and nothing happened. I tried tapping keys for awhile. Then I tried pushing the power button, nothing. Held it for 10 seconds nothing. I thought it might've been lower in battery power than I realized so I connected AC power. Light goes green-orange like it should. I tried the power button again, and it boots up. I get to the login and everything is fine, the battery percentage does not show that is connected and charging. I disconnect and reconnect and no change: power is supposedly running on the battery even though it's plugged in. And then I notice that eventually the AC power plug glows green like it's fully charged but it's not showing that in the battery icon percentage.\nThinking there might be some kind of power management issue, I tried resetting the SMC. I shut down completely, disconnected AC, and pushed the key combination. Nothing! That freaked me out a little, so I tried again. This time it seemed to work. Once booted up, I see that percentage, charging, and or being on battery/AC still don't seem to be matching.\nIf I leave it to go to sleep, running on battery, I cannot get it to wake with clamshell opening or tapping keys. I have to either hold power until it chimes or reset SMC again. Coconut battery sometimes seems to be in sync with the battery gauge, sometimes it's not. Right now I have a green light on the power plug, but 89% charging in the battry icon and it hasn't changed in an hour.\nI tried resetting the NVRAM, but nothing changed. I tried running the Apple Diagnostics but got an error message:\nError: 0x80000000000000003, Cannot Load 'EFI/Drivers/TestSupport.efi'\nStatus: 0x00000003 \n\nI don't know what to do here.

Apart from the inconvenience of messing with reboots and such, is there any danger or data loss or complete failure until I can arrange for a battery replacement?\n\nA: Ordered a replacement battery kit, replaced the battery, ran through the battery conditioning charging cycles, and the MacBook is better than before.

That particular 13” MacBook Pro doesn’t have a discrete GPU so it has to share all of the graphics processing with the CPU.  Additionally, it’s using up to 1.5GB of your system RAM as video memory.  You can see this when you disconnect the external monitor, the mouse no longer lags; it’s because the CPU isn’t working hard to drive that monitor.\nThe reality here you’d most likely do better with a higher end MacBook Air than you would a low end MacBook Pro.  (IMO) the reason you get a “Pro” is for the discrete video and higher memory capacity.  If you’re not getting the Pro with the AMD Radeon GPU and the maximum memory, you’re not getting full value.\nIf you are within the return window, I’d return it and either get a MacBook Pro with a GPU (even a used one) or get a higher spec MacBook Air and save some money.\nLagging mouse\nYou shouldn’t need native Logitech drivers to make your mouse not lag.  If you don’t have them, your Mac will use the standard USB HID device drivers from Apple and it will behave like a generic 3 or 5 button mouse.  The additional software from Logitech is merely for all the special customizations that Logitech brings to the table.  The fact that the mouse performance returns to normal when you remove the external display confirms that it’s not a mouse driver issue.\nCables & Connections\nYour HDMI cable isn’t going to make things better in terms of blur or color or mouse lagginess.  The signal(s) that go over these cables are digital (1s and 0s) meaning you can introduce a ton of noise on the cable and it will still be a digital signal at the end.  Cables quality matters in terms of build quality (how it flexes, how the ends were molded, if the pins are not shorted, etc.) I recommend high quality cables to protect your equipment and ensure a reliable connection, not to fix display quality issues because, if it didn’t have the required bandwidth (met the HDMI spec in question) you wouldn’t get the resolution and frame rate that you’re getting.  Blurriness is a factor of the wrong resolution for your particular monitor.\nYou should use a quality DisplayPort cable instead of converting to HDMI.  If you notice, your “Connection Type” is Thunderbolt/DisplayPort (last line of your system report), but you’re using HDMI.  This means you’re converting from the native DisplayPort signal to HDMI; this can  introduce video issues.  I’m a staunch proponent of not converting signals and sticking to DisplayPort.  You Dell monitor supports DisplayPort so I would go with that first and if you must go HDMI, use an active adapter.\nTL;DR - Possible Fixes\n\n*\n\n*Connect monitor via DisplayPort and not HDMI.  Not having to convert a signal is inherently more efficient and more reliable.  The Dell P2719H accepts DisplayPort as an input.\n\n\n*If possible, get a MacBook Pro with a discrete GPU (if within the return window).  The 2020 13” MacBook Pro with 1.7GHz CPU uses the 8th Gen. Intel Core processor where as the 2020 MacBook Air uses the 10th gen.  The latter being more efficient for less money.\n\n\n*Downscale your monitor to no larger than  22” FHD display.  You’re driving two displays, one of them a massive 27” with nothing but integrated graphics.  The less your CPU has to render, the more efficient it will be.\n\nA: How is your HDMI cable connected to your USB-C on the MBP side?\nI had similar issues and realised that certain combinations of HDMI or HP Display port cables in conjunction with cheap Ali-express converters to USB-C resulted in either a blurred external monitor or even sometimes in the MBP monitor being blurred and the external monitor being perfectly clear.\nSo if you have the chance, try using different cable combos, just to see if it makes a difference.\n\nA: I had this issue lately too/randomly on M1 Macbook Pro, 2021 model, 16\".\nI am using a 34\" external via HDMI, and Logitech wireless mouse as well.\nI was using a USB-C adapter with HDMI/Lan/USB A ports, to plug in the monitor, which usually was fine, but now swapped to the built in HDMI on the laptop.\nAlthough, I don't think it is the cable/etc in my issue, but not 100% positive. It's the cable from the PS4... which SHOULD be decent I'd think... I found if I unplug the cable while the monitor is connected, or even just go into monitor preferences and set the refresh rate to lower, then set it back to 50HZ, then my mouse is fine..\nAlso if i moved the mouse between the external display to mac display, when the issue is preset, it was smooth on built in display and lagging on external, so that's why I thought to try to reset the refresh rate.  Also mouse was lagging with the built in touch-pad even.\nAs far as weird text, that's more a scaling issue/core issue with MacOS from what I understand... I get similar issues.  People said Mac uses 2X scaling or something like that, and if your res doesn't match a certain ratio, it gets funky.  Overall mine looks OK, but sometimes youtube videos can get some harsh lines/aliasing.\n", "Q: Will my app be rejected by Apple if I ask user for a 5 star and positive review comment after I will award them my In-App for free?

In the past, I have pasted apps into TextEdit, which would show something like the following. I always thought that this was a convenient way to store app icons (as .icns files), in case I ever wanted to back a list of my apps up (just the names/icons, not the apps themselves) to manually download and install later.\nI recently tried pasting about 20 apps into a TextEdit document, and the document turned out to be about 3GB large. This definitely is much larger than the .icns files for 20 apps. What exactly is stored in this TextEdit document?\n\n\nA: When pasting an application into TextEdit as an RTF document and saved as Rich Text Document with Attachments it creates a Rich Text document bundle, e.g. Untitled.rtfd and will contain a copy of the application pasted into the document.\nThe more apps you paste into the document the larger it will be.\nYou can check the contents of the e.g. Untitled.rtfd document bundle by selecting it in Finder and right-click then select Show Package Contents.\nThere you will see a copy of each application bundle you've pasted into the Rich Text Document that was saved as Rich Text Document with Attachments.\n\nA: Apple’s copy / paste mechanism contains multitudes.\nWhen you copy something - many levels of data are stored into the pasteboard object - literally a reference to these apps is available to any application that receives a paste command.\nYou can start on understanding this rich and complicated behavior with two items:\n\n*\n\n*An excellent app to show you what’s really on the pasteboard\n\n*An excellent write up on how this all works.\n\nFor #1 I recommend the pasteboard viewer - https://sindresorhus.com/pasteboard-viewer - it’s on the MacApp Store and also source code is available under the MIT license.\nFor #2 I recommend the writings of Howard Oakley - his dives to the depths of the code and implementation yet writes clearly and in accessible terms. https://eclecticlight.co/2020/05/12/cut-copy-paste-inside-the-pasteboard-clipboard/\n\nWhen you paste an item from the clipboard, its data are passed to the requesting app, which then performs any conversion necessary, and inserts it in the document.\n\n\nSo to answer your question, it’s possible you have all of the various resolution of the icon images pasted into your document, but I would need to examine either your document or your exact pasteboard contents prior to pasting to answer your question. Hopefully the general answer above helps everyone as well as you dig into specifics.\nRTFD documents are plain text with attachments, so you can examine them in the command line or control click to show package contents just like other folders in Finder.\n", "Q: How do I increase size of Virtual Memory in Mac OS Catalina? I am running Mac OS Catalina 10.15.6 with APFS formatted disk on an unsupported MAC using dosdude1 guide. My experience from windows is I had to make careful calculations on pagefile.sys and run into limits on swap and memory. Since I’m new to Mac, I wish to avoid any mistakes and learn how to manage things properly.\nThis is the view of my disk\n\nI have 4 Gigs of RAM on my system.\nI want to increase the sizeof the Virtual Memory VM (which is 3.22 GB currently).\nI have searched the internet in vain. Even a question in Ask Different has not been answered. My terms to solve this on windows aren’t helping me on Mac.\nHow do I achieve  my goals and choose which size I should allocate?\n\nA: The short answer, is you do nothing. The system decides what memory gets swapped to disk and allocates space as needed. The system allocates virtual memory addresses up to ~18 exabytes so that it can then swap as needed.\n\nNote: Unlike most UNIX-based operating systems, OS X does not use a preallocated disk partition for the backing store. Instead, it uses all of the available space on the machine’s boot partition.\n\nYou may just have to choose programs that use macOS better if your system is in memory pressure and you can’t wait for things to work. Virtual memory and swap guarantee that programs eventually run when you over load the actual resources available. There is no need to change any tuning or limits on iOS or macOS.\nEven better, containers let you share space and not get jammed with pagefile.sys blocking space. I recommend exactly what you propose, APFS containers to share all possible space. Add an inexpensive external drive and let time machine back everything up so you are free to experiment without losing any games or data.\n", "Q: Rules in iOS mail Is there a way to set up simple rules (When subject contains “foobar“ move Mail to trash.) in Mail.app on iOS 13?\n\nA: The best you can do is block the sender from sending messages to you. This is done in Settings/Mail.  This will block email, phone calls, etc from the blocked site. This is available on iOS 13 and later.\n\nIgnore Blocked Senders can now be enabled in Settings > Mail.

I’ve not seen erase all content and settings fix this, but I always try that before I restore since it’s a lot faster and I’m about to reload a backup either way at that point.\nOnce you’re sure it’s not a software issue, then it’s time for a hardware repair or swap. Apple has replaced my camera module on that model phone and I was extremely satisfied with the results. Much cheaper than a new phone as well even if you pay for the repair instead of AppleCare or warranty.\n", "Q: Can I boot my mac without pressing the power key? Back in the day you could start a Macintosh using the power key on the keyboard (like the Apple Extended 2 has one in the top right).\nThese days we have many (more) input options like: Power, USB, Ethernet, HDMI, Thunderbolt, Audio in/out, SD card reader, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.\nI have a MacMini (2011) which is under the desk. Is it possible to boot a mac (or my Mini) after a shutdown WITHOUT pressing the power button?\nI tried the 'Start up automatically after a power failure' but after a cold shutdown, a power cord disconnect/connect did not boot my computer.\n\n\n\nA: shutdown -u\n\nI tried the 'Start up automatically after a power failure' but after a cold shutdown, a power cord disconnect/connect did not boot my computer.\n\nThe automatic power on only works if the power was cut. You can induce this behaviour using the command shutdown -u now. According to man shutdown the -u flag does the following:\n\n-u: The system is halted up until the point of removing system power,\nbut waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external\nUPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.\nThis simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power\non. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in\nemergency shutdowns.\n\n", "Q: Is this display problem of my MacBook Air a GPU issue? I have a 2019  MacBook Air and sometimes, this problem happens when I try to open the laptop; it glitches. I think this happens because I restored the Mac and deleted all my old files last week.\nBut this really only happened a few times in the past week and  only happend twice. I don’t know if I have to fix it or if it’s covered under warranty.\n\n\nA: Artifacts on the screen like that are typically graphics chip issues (logic board).   However, there is the possibility that it could be related to the OS.  There are a few diagnostic things you can try:\n\n*\n\n*Boot in Safe Mode\n\n*Install macOS onto a USB drive and boot from that (32GB or 64GB flash disk is fine.  Make sure it’s USB 3 or it will be slow\n\n*Erase the drive and do a clean install of macOS\n\nThis is roughly the order you should try things out to see if you can fix or narrow down the cause of the problem.  You can always take it in for service and I encourage you to do so especially if under warranty.\n", "Q: Migrate from Aperture to Photos: use Catalina or Mojave? I have an old Aperture photo library and I am now planning to finally upgrade from Mojave to Catalina on that system. I know I need to migrate my photo library but I'd like to know in what order I should do that. Upgrade to Catalina and then use the version of Photos to migrate my Aperture library or migrate first and then upgrade to Cataline. The former would use a newer version of Photos with possibly(?) a few migration bugs ironed out, the latter clearly has the advantage to still be able to open my library with Aperture until I'm sure I'm happy with the migration. So, any other thoughts, things I am missing?\n\nA: I would be sure you delay losing Aperture until you’re sure you have a good import. I haven’t needed to load Aperture myself, so it might be a moot point, but better safe than sorry would be my advice. Go to Mojave and get an excellent backup you know you could restore in bootable format if you have professional photos, pro level metadata and edits / albums or can’t reimport them later.\nYou surely can reimport the raw images, so if that’s an option, going straight to Catalina might be faster for you with not much extra risk.\nWhen I moved all in on Photos, I purchased Power Photos to help split libraries since I knew all my photos were 250 GB and I didn't want to pay for more than 200 GB of iCloud storage and I'm all-in on cloud library with a local backup.

Connect to iTunes. No backup Kids were playing with my iPhone X and disabled it (entering wrong password multiple times, \"iPhone disabled. Connect to iTunes\" on screen).\nI know the password, but there's no way to enter it. I don't have a backup, and I want to keep my data on the phone. (I know there's a reset option, which I'll use as the last resort)\nThis answer on iFixit from 2019 claims that if I update the phone from iTunes, it will allow me to enter the password in an hour.\nCan anyone confirm if this works? I don't want to try it and make things worse.\nUPDATE: Got off the phone with Apple support, they told me there's no way to get the data back without the backup. So I guess iTunes update referenced in the linked post no longer works that way.\n\nUPDATE 2: Updated via iTunes, was not prompted to backup or to enter password in 1 hour. Phone still says \"Connect to iTunes\" after update. So I guess Apple support tech was right.\n\n\nA: I would connect this to any iTunes you have that has ever had a chance to save an unlock key for that device. Unless you already have a trust relationship between iTunes in a computer and this phone, it’s going to wait for you to decide to erase it or you find a way to jailbreak it or crack the protection.\nIf you have full trust, it will reverse the disable when it’s connected to the internet and your phone is connected and everything is working. Update should prompt to make a backup, allow it. Restore likely will not do a backup, but I don’t have a disabled device to test this for you.\n\nA: The iFixit post you reference says to play the device in recovery mode, then update it through iTunes. To enter recovery mode, follow the instructions here. Make sure to choose update when prompted and not restore. If an update isn't available you can for a newer version of iOS to be released, but that may take months.\nApple says the update option will not remove data, but I cannot be sure myself as I've never tried it before.\nOtherwise you could try 3rd-party blocking software, but that is risky and potentially dangerous and therefore I wouldn't recommend it.\nYour only option might be to restore and loose your data.\n", "Q: How can I place .dmg files away from the desktop? Every time I install an app, I get a DMG file showing up on the desktop. It looks like this:\n\nHow do I hide it on the desktop or keep them elsewhere to preserve the aesthetic?\nWhen I Control + click on it, I don't see any way to hide it.\nAlso, when I do ls -al on the desktop, they never show up. Why is that?\n\nA: What you're seeing is the mounted disk image,  you need to eject them.\nThese are no different than a USB disk or flash drive that you attach or a CD/DVD media that you load into a drive.  It will show up on your Desktop so you have an easy way to access them.  Once you're done installing them, you can simply right click and then select Eject.\nFor example, I double clicked a (random) DMG file (Western Digital macOS Apps) that was in a different directory (from my Desktop) and the mounted file shows up on the Desktop.  If you double click, you will see the contents (usually install scripts or the App to be copied to the /Applications folder).  When you're done, right click and select Eject.  Note, many newer apps (VirtualBox I know does this) will, as part of it's script eject and move the DMG to Trash for you.\n\nIf using Terminal, you can see them by listing the contents of /Volumes:\n% ls /Volumes\n\nYou cannot delete the item; if you  drag it to the Trash, the trash icon will turn into the Eject Symbol.\n\n\nA: If you want to eject the mounted DMG, please see Allan's excellent answer - or more simply do a secondary click on the DMG icon and select the Eject option.\nHowever, if you want to keep the DMG mounted, but don't want it to appear on your desktop, you can do that too! Go to Finder → Preferences → General, and under \"Show these items on the desktop:\" uncheck \"External disks\".\nNote that this will also cause USB keys and similar to not appear on the desktop; you can access them from the Sidebar in Finder.\n\n", "Q: External hard drive unrecognizable in disk utility but found in System Information I've got a WD EasyStore 1TB external hard drive that won't show up in disk utility at all. I've tried multiple MacBooks and on my raspberry pi.

I have looked for a fsck_hfs or fsck_exfat process running to see if the machine is trying to repair the disk before it runs it at all. Nothing. When I try to reboot my MacBook with the drive connected to it, it stays stalled on the apple logo for as long as I'll let it. I can see that it is recognized as a USB connection in System Information, but it is not recognized as storage at all. Help, please!!!\n\nA: If several Macs and a Pi have all failed to read the disk, then I'd suggest it's not a software problem.\nIt's likely that the hard drive has failed in some way. WD drives are known to have poor enclosures, but getting the drive out of a portable drive shell is not easy.\nYou can try taking it to a data recovery firm, but it will be expensive. If you have a backup, just toss it. (This one, not the backup.)\nOtherwise, you can try data recovery software yourself, but if the drive won't even be recognised, it's unlikely.\n", "Q: Dark mode issues in iPhone 6s running iOS 13.6.1 Until yesterday, the Dark Mode on my iPhone was fine.

As far as my Mac is concerned, it never happened.\nAm I just missing something, or did my Mac just obliterate the file when I pressed Done?\n\nA: I had a similar problem in Big Sur, I was doing a screen recording (video) using Cmd-Shift-5, and had the \"Show Floating Thumbnail\" option set. This gave a thumbnail of the capture on the bottom right when it ended. I accidentally swiped right on the icon and the recording disappeared and wasn't saved to the location I set it to.\nI eventually found it in ~/Library/ScreenRecordings. I'm not sure if it gets cleaned up after awhile but luckily I found it soon after the capture.\nTo prevent this problem in the future, I turned off the \"Show Floating Thumbnail\" option, so the recording should automatically save in the location that is set under settings.\n", "Q: Will Turning Data usage off disable the hotspot? Without going into to much detail of why I’m asking .... if I turn off the data usage of one persons iPhone will that essentially disable their ability to be the “hot spot” for someone else to connect to... Even if they are connected to WiFi...\nPerson one has WiFi access and data and the ability to be a WiFi hotspot.\nPerson 2 doesn’t have any of that so they connect to person 1 to leach off their data plan.\nIf I turn off the data plan for person one they can still connect to WiFi. Can the hotspot be used by person 2 if no data plan is active for person 1? Hope that makes sense...\n\nA: Technically, yes.If you turn off the data plan, then regardless if they try to be a hotspot, it won’t matter because there won’t be a data plan to use.\nHowever, (I know this because I was researching data plans last week) you can get a data plan that doesn’t have hot spot or tethering capability.  So, your user can still have mobile data, but they won’t be able to use their mobile device as a hotspot.   You also might want to ask the carrier if they can manually turn off the hotspot function.\n", "Q: How to remove a book from a Books collection In Books app we can organize books in collections.

Please recommend an external speaker to increase volume. I tried Creative Pebble, quality was fine, but volume remains low.\nI bumped the audio to 96.0 kHz to no avail.Am I stuck with insufficient volume?\n\nA: The sound from the Mac mini won’t be that strong to begin with because they use a laptop speaker and it’s very tiny to begin with!\n\nSee iFixit\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+Mini+Mid+2010+Teardown/3094\nTo get more volume I recommend using external amplified speakers.  Regular computer speakers will work or you can plug it into one of those Bluetooth portable speakers with an INPUT port.  I did this with my MBP and a really cheap audio cable (I think they are 3.5mm plugs).\nI did some research on the Creative Pebble (original one) and they are USB powered so there’s not a lot of power.  In this article from PC Mag, they say “it’s a pretty limited system”  and they are a “notable upgrade over laptop or phone speakers.”  To me, that sounds like a very low bar to jump over.

I brought a Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad in early 2019. Recently the left-shift left-contrl space keys work very weird. When I press them, they react very \"weakly and slowly\", it's like there's something like mud beneath them. And if I use some force to push it, it did work, but the rounce is also very weird - slow and stuck.\nAfter a careful check, I can't find anything unusual or dirty under those keys.\nSometimes they're behaving like this in the evening, but getting better the next morning. So I guess it may not be a hardware issue.\nWhat wrong with this keyboard? Does anyone know the reason and how to solve it? I can't find the product page for now and I believe Apple has taken this product offline.\nThe keyboard I bought looks like this:\n\n\nA: Software cannot adjust nor control how these keys respond so it's definitely a physical issue. Additionally, software isn't going to pick the evening to make one or two keys harder to press and then relent in the morning.\nIf it's feeling weird and responding slowly is because something is breaking down or you have a containment build up. It could be the mechanism or one of the layers - insulating or conductive - that has an issue.  The fact that you're having an issue in the lower left hand corner where ⇧ Shift and ^ Control and  have their contact points (there are two for Space) leads me to believe there is some sort of containment/corrosion on the conductive PCB layer.  Until you open it, you won't know for sure.\nKeyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix\nUnfortunately, these keyboards are designed to be disposable so there really is no fixing it. The keyboard assemblies are now held in place with plastic \"welds\" (the plastic posts are melted down like rivets) to hold the assembly together.  You'd have to cut all of these welds off and then find a way to re-glue everything back together.\nSomething that's just over a year old and barely out of warranty is worth a shot with Apple support.  These are expensive accessories and should have issues so soon.  I would give it try to see if they will replace it for you - the worst that will happen is that they decline the replacement and you have to buy a new keyboard.\n", "Q: \"Wake on LAN\" my Mac Mini from my PC?

This works really well.\n\n*I can ping the Mac Mini (when it is on) from my PC and it responds.\n\nAny ideas on how to close the loop on this?\n\nA: You normally have to access a shared resource on the Mac rather than use a magic packet.\nThe simplest way is to set up file sharing (allowing SMB for the PC) and try to access that from the PC.  This could be any folder you like so you do not have to worry about it being visible to others on the network and can (should) be password protected.\nOther things that should work are:\n\n*\n\n*Shared printers / scanners\n\n*Music\n\n*Music play lists\n\n*Screen sharing (I think but that may have been via VNC on the Mac)\n\n", "Q: \"Create Diagnostics Report\" not generating (or not generating in right location)?

Is it possible to run a diagnostics report via terminal (and perhaps specify where it should be written to?)\n\nA: I just ran this on my older iMac running High Sierra. It ran to completion in about 10 minutes. It wrote the output to the tmp directory but probably not the tmp directory you checked. On my machine, it wrote the output to /private/var/tmp. The folder 'private' won't show up using Finder unless you 'show hidden items'. This requires hitting the command-shift-dot keys at the same time. Then the Finder will display the 'private' folder. So from / you can see the private folder.

I'm currently on Mac OS 10.15.6.\nInitial attempt\nI want to remove the default shortcut:\nShift-Command-I: Open iCloud Drive.\nAnd replace with a Services shortcut:\nShift-Command-I: New iTerm2 Window Here.\nI've implemented the shortcut in the Keyboard page, however, the shortcut still just opens iCloud Drive when Finder is open. Outside of Finder, the shortcut works.\nNext attempt\nI've tried following posts on here, like this one on how to read and write global shortcuts, however I fail to find any. My assumption is that the shortcut would be available through com.developer.finder based on what I've read.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"iCloud Drive\" nil\n\nHowever, even after running this, I'm unable to see any NSUserKeyEquivalents.\ndefaults read com.developer.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents\n# 2020-08-24 08:06:47.084 defaults[1073:19364]\n# The domain/default pair of (com.developer.finder, NSUserKeyEquivalents) does not exist\n\nI've tried running with \"Open iCloud Drive\", writing to com.apple.Finder, but nothing has worked.\nQuestions\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*Have I fundamentally misunderstood how doing this is supposed to work?\n\n*Are the shortcuts under the Finder --> Go menu able to be changed in this way?\n\n*Is there another method to remove the open iCloud keyboard shortcut?\n\nThanks.\n\nA: com.developer.finder is wrong.\ncom.apple.finder is more likely, but the shortcut is available in file dialogs, so may not be under the purview of the Finder.\nFirst off, I'd try changing the shortcut to something else. Either do it in System Preferences, or try adapting your command from nil to -string \"@$^~i\"\n(@ is Command; $ is shift, ^ is ctrl, ~ is alt.)\nNext, you could try adding it to the user Global preferences.\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"iCloud Drive\" -string \"@$^~i\"\n\nHowever, it's equally possible that some key commands are hardwired and cannot be changed.\n", "Q: Are the \"Looks like\" resolutions in the scaling modes on Retina Macs the true resolution they run at? Hopefully, this doesn't sound like a dumb question, but I'm wondering if the \"Looks like\" resolutions listed for each scaling mode in System Preferences > Displays are the true resolutions one would be running at/seeing when using any of them.\nWhat made me interested in finding this out is when I read that the 2880x1800 resolution shown in About This Mac on the Early 2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro (and I assume many others) was not actually easily accessible without a tool like Retina Display Master (RDM). So I got it here: https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM, and through this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG42tS2wTK4, found there was a more updated fork of it (https://github.com/usr-sse2/RDM/tree/2.3.2), which is fully compatible with Catalina (that apparently allowed you to set custom HiDPI resolutions by disabling SIP).\nAt some point between finding out about RDM's existence and the updated fork of it, I also found out you could scale said 15\" display not to just 2880x1800, but a ridiculous 3840x2400.\nTo keep this from being an unnecessarily long question/post (might be a bit too late for that), I am trying to keep the 3840x2400 resolution (potentially for the sake of things like 4K video or photo editing) while having the UI not be so small and difficult to read.\nAs of writing this, I currently believe that picking one of the larger scaling options in System Preferences > Displays is actually showing that \"Looks like\" resolution (this is because RDM shows the current resolution in its menu bar icon, though I have no other way to confirm this, which is why I'm asking the question) not a possible higher resolution(?).\nOne of the things I can do when using the higher resolutions is to make the Dock (a lot) bigger, which is helpful but doesn't nearly solve the problem in its entirety.\nThis issue on the original RDM repository seems to explain basically what I'm thinking, just far simpler: https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM/issues/40\nAgain, hopefully, at least some of this makes sense to people and doesn't come across as complete nonsensical garbage.\nAdditional note: Disabling SIP and trying to add a \"custom\" HiDPI 3840x2400 in RDM (which to me sounds like it would double the size of UI elements while retaining that resolution) did not appear to do anything, or at least not what I thought it would do.\n\nA: The answer to your question really depends on the definition of the \"true\" resolution.\nSome people would say that the resolution that the actual display uses is the \"true resolution\". This means that this is the actual \"pixels\" you can turn on/off.\nIf you use this definition, the \"Looks like\" resolution is not the true resolution. The \"true resolution\" is much higher, usually double of that. However \"Looks like\" means that things on screen appear as if the resolution was that, but pixels have been doubled (or nearly doubled) in order to improve sharpness and clarity while maintaining an actual physical size of letters, shapes, etc. that is not too small for you to be able to read.\nFor example you might have a 4k display capable of displaying 3840x2160 pixels. You might choose a setup here that \"Looks like\" 1920x1080. The actual resolution in terms of pixel data sent to and shown on the display is 3840x2160, but user interface elements, font sizes, etc. have been scaled so that in terms of physical size it looks like you had a 1920x1080 display of the same physical size. The benefit you get is that text and other elements are \"clearer\" on screen.\n\nA: The point to remember is that the display is a physical grid of pixels. They do not grow larger or smaller; they do not increase or decrease in number when you 'change the resolution'.\nIt's all a trick of software. Does this shape take up 12 pixels, 6 pixels, or 3 pixels with a bit of blur spilling onto next door's pixels?\nMy advice is to set the display to the default 2x scaling and don't give it any more thought. I certainly wouldn't disable SIP.\nYour laptop's display is too small to show 'pixel for pixel' 4K video. You're not going to get extra detail because some software is faking a larger screen size than you actually have.\n", "Q: Find my iPhone: Can everyone who i've shared my location with see each other's location?

I am just wondering when using the option erase all content and data how this is done from a system side, does it format a partition on the memory or does it just delete it remove indexes like a normal delete? I would imagine the system files are pretty much untouched? Example scenario I am imagining here is;\nA) system partition 2GB ish \nB) recovery partition, no idea \nC) user space, everything else \nSo when a factory reset happens does C have it's data deleted or just totally formatted?\nIf the later would it skip empty cells on a format?\nFor example Joe Bloggs gets a new iPhone, usage is 20gb/120gb. 3 days later factory resets it, does it use one of the flash memories finite writes on the entire partition  using limited writes or skip over it and write over just the 20gb? I am assuming here that the memory in each iPhone cell can take around 20,000 wipes anyway, so would each cell go down to around 19,999 on average or just the cells that used to have data on before the format if there is one?\n\nA: Actually it is both more complicated as well as simpler!\nWhen you choose to erase all contents from the device, the only thing overwritten and deleted is the encryption key for the device. Without the key, the contents of the disk drive is no longer accessible to anyone, and is thus treated as being equivalent with it being deleted.\nIn your example, neither 120 GB nor 20 GB of data is written to the disk. It is only a very small amount (less than 1 MB) that is written. Namely the encryption key(s) are overwritten, and the drive is formatted a new (which only writes certain data structures to the drive - it does not as such overwrite the old data contents of the drive, neither used or non-used).\n\nA: When flash NAND get's wiped, it's not actually erased.  It's marked as unused and depending on the technology used, it will either return garbage or zeros.  When that space is asked to store something, it's at that point it gets overwritten.\nSince iOS (as of 10.3) shares the APFS filesystem that macOS uses, we can reasonably say that file maintenance is essentially the same.  How deletions are handled depends on how it's implemented in the hardware.\n→ Can the data on an MacBook Pro SSD be recovered after formatting using Disk Utility\nSecondly, there isn't a hard limit on the number of writes - yes, there is a finite limit, but it's a calculated value.  It's not going to be like there's exactly 20K writes and the moment you go from 19,999 to the next one, it stops working.  This is similar to charge cycles on a battery - it doesn't stop working at 1000 cycles as many people seem to believe.  Additionally, there isn't a \"limiter\" that will turn off your drive when it reaches a certain point.  There are however, technologies built into the hardware like wear leveling that ensures consistency across the entire SSD.\n\nSo when a factory reset happens does C [user space, everything else]  have it's data deleted or just totally formatted? If the later would it skip empty cells on a format?\n\nOn a full factory reset?  Yes.  However, you can reset the iPhone without removing all the data and settings.  When it's formatted, it will mark the used cells as unused and any attempt to read them will return gibberish or zeros.  Unused cells would be skipped.\n", "Q: How do I completely reset and delete all Music.app settings and configurations I was looking for a way to get a completely clean slate on the Music.app in macOS Catalina.\nI attempted to find and delete all related settings in ~/Library, ~/Library/Cache, ~/Library/Preferences, and removed the Music folder from ~/Music.\nHowever, every time I start up the Music.app after this, the old song list information is still there, but obviously, the music files cannot be found since I deleted them.

Last year before Catalina was released, I tried to perform a disk image of my boot drive of Mojave (macOS 10.14) on a new computer before updating and customizing it. I have done this for years to preserve a certain state of macOS installation for future re-use. BUT this time with Mojave, I kept running into many errors. So how can this be done? Is this no longer allowed by Apple?\nTo be clear, looking for a solution using with Disk Image Utility only, not third party tools.\n\nA: I FOUND THE SOLUTION to using Apple Disk Utility to create RELIABLE disk images of APFS drives. The ONLY path to make a viable re-usable disk image formatted as APFS in 3 simple steps is (though finding the solution was not simple to figure out nor straight-forward):\n\n*\n\n*First create a blank image file formatted as APFS and Read/Write (requires pre-determining size of image file).\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The image (destination) cannot be stored on the same drive or partition (source) from which you are going to create the image.\n\n\n*use Restore from  to clone to newly created image file\n(Highlight destination  then click [Restore] button and select Restore From .\n\n\n*convert image file to Compressed format (Image > Convert).\nONLY THEN do you have a reliable APFS image, especially w/bootable macOS. I have done this repeatedly and it works fine. The important distinction with this solution is that it not only creates a valid disk image, the image can then be used to re-create a boot volume, which is after all, the point of this.\nANY other options/paths, are greyed out, yield \"Resource busy\" or \"image is not APFS format\" errors or produces image that is not reliable. Even using Apple Internet Recovery tools/boot was the same.\nNOTE: you do NOT need to do ANY of this using Recovery tools. You can do this from a live boot of macOS drive. If you do not have a destination to store the image file other than the same internal drive, you can create a partition large enough to store the image file, using Disk Utility. And yes, you can partition macOS boot drive live.\nCAVEAT: Tested only using Mojave 10.14.4 on 2019 27\" i9 iMac w 40GB RAM and 512GB SSD (no T2 chip), so YMMV.\nApple needs to fix Disk Utility to work straightforward like it used to but with better support for APFS.\nHTH.\nBTW, I posted original answer in the open forum here: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mojave-and-hfs-it-can-be-done.2125194/page-2#post-27595211\n\nIn my search for an answer to the above question, I could not find the correct answer... several threads on this site and others give the WRONG answer, essentially, \"it is not supported\" or \"it cannot be done\"... This is the WRONG answer.\nIn the answer section I post the CORRECT answer, which I discovered through a lot of experimentation. This corrects the answers provided at each of the links below, which are all wrong:\nCreate a disk image for recovery\n\"Create disk image\" disabled\nHow to Make Bootable APFS Volume From Disk Image\n(for this thread you need the equivalent terminal commands to do what is described above).\nThe info provide by @grg (in the first thread) is not correct. Even in the image provided it shows that you cannot create an \"Image from SSD\" because it is greyed out. Even booting into Recovery does not accomplish the desired results in that answer...\n\nA: Not sure if this works on earlier versions but in Monterey I just had to enable disk utility in the full disk access permissions tab in security and privacy. Then I was able to make a disk image of the apfs container on my external drive and mounted it successfully.\n", "Q: Keep copy/paste and TOC in PDF converted from ebook? For research, I often convert non-DRM ebooks to PDF using Calibre.  The resulting PDF has a TOC with working links.  However, it is not searchable in Preview, and copy/paste results in blank white space, even when pasting into TextEdit or nValt.\n(Adobe Acrobat can search, copy/paste the PDF and the TOC works, but I use many tools that use Apple's PDF frameworks, so I'd like to solve this.)\nTo make it searchable and copyable, I run the PDF through Ghostscript using these commands:\ngs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=\"output\" \"input\"\nThis renders a new PDF that is searchable, and copy/pastes properly.  However, it strips the links from the TOC.\nIs there a way to convert the PDF so that it will retain its TOC links and also be searchable and have copy/paste work?\n\nA: I suppose the first thing would be to investigate Calibre's PDF output to see if it is to spec, and whether it has options that Preview might prefer.\nGhostscript normally should preserve bookmarks and other annotations.

Answers to Add equations that flows with the text in the keynote explain that in Keynote we can insert an in-line equation when typing text. I use option-command-E or the same from pull-down Insert menu and it works fine for text in a text object.\nHowever: when I'm writing text inside of a cell of a table this fails. No matter what I do the equation pops out of the text and becomes a floating equation.\nIf I copy a line of text that contains an in-line equation and paste it inside the cell of a table, the text appears but the equation is dropped.\nIs there any way to include equations in-line with text within the cell of a table in Keynote?\nKeynote version 9.2.1 (6529)\n\\int_0^{n\\pi}\\cos(ax^n)\n\n\nA: It is not possible to have an equation created by the equation editor (Insert > Equation menu from the top) inline with text inside a table cell in Keynote. This is possible in Pages but not in Keynote.\nThe problem stems from a Keynote table not being allowed to accept a picture as a text element in a cell. This behavior leads to an equation not being accepted inside a table cell as a text element in Keynote because an output of the equation editor is handled as a picture by the programs in the iWork suite (Numbers, Pages, Keynote).\nA partial solution to this problem within Keynote is to create all of the contents of a cell using the equation editor and paste it inside the corresponding cell (automatically as a picture). The appearance of each \"equation\" picture can then be adjusted using Format > Cell > Fill menu on the sidebar on the right as shown in the example below (Keynote v10.1). Note that, once pasted, one can not edit the equation picture in a cell. If any change is needed to a cell with an equation, then the whole \"equation\" needs to be re-created and pasted into the corresponding cell.\n\n\nA: This isn't a clean answer (does not solve the issue presented in the original question) but I'll post what I've learned and possibly an alternative.\nWhen I test this using Keynote (v10.1) I see the same behavior ...\nIf I create a simple text box, I can perform an Insert -> Equation... in mid sentence and this works provided the text is not in a table cell.\nIf I perform the same action inside a table cell, the equation becomes a floating element (no longer tied to the text or cell).\nIf I perform the same action in Pages (v10.1) this works correctly even within a table.\n\nThe bad news is that if I then attempt to copy this table onto a Keynote slide, the equation is dropped.\nThis seems like a bug considering it is implemented as expected in Pages ... but Keynote has an issue with it.\nYou can send feedback to Apple here:  https://www.apple.com/feedback/keynote.html\n", "Q: how dangerous is it to give zsh full disk access? I have a shell script that runs a few (Duplicacy) backup commands. It works fine when I manually run the script from terminal (cd to the directory where it is and then ./backup.sh).\nTo make it run automatically I created a launch agent (a .plist file). When it runs now, I get only \"operation not permitted\" errors whenever Duplicacy attempts to open a preference file or any other file to do its backups. The permission of the script is 755, and it's owned by the same user as the the files Duplicacy tried to open.\nQuite a bit of research suggests that I should open Security & Privacy in Preferences and allow zsh to have full disk access. I tried this and it solved the problem.\nIs this overkill and dangerous for this issue? Is it ok for zsh to have full disk access?\n\nA: There’s no inherent danger per se with respect to ZSH; it’s only a shell.\nWhat is “dangerous” is what you run in the shell.   Most users don’t use the shell so securing it gives a nice level of extra security so when they inadvertently download nefarious apps from the Internet, they will have the protection that the shell doesn’t have full disk access.\nIs it overkill?  In my opinion, no.  If you run scripts like this backup script, you’re going to want access to more than just one or two directories (which you can do, by the way); you’ll want access to the whole disk.\n", "Q: How can I set oh my zsh to be my default shell? I'm using Hyper as my terminal application and I just installed Oh My Zsh via curl. I'd like it to be my default shell environment but for some reason whenever I restart Hyper I have to run the zsh command to get to Oh My Zsh. Is this normal?\n\nA: Yes it’s somewhat normal since there’s a bug and some people aren’t restarting after changing the system shell to zsh as described below and in the hyper documents.\nYou should be able to make the switch to have it restart though. One note, before the fix is addressed - Oh My Zsh isn’t a shell.  It’s a set of ZSH shell customizations like creating a colorful and grphical prompt or autocompletion and even file selection. The shell is the bus and “omz” is a specific seat arrangement, paint and stylings on the bus that get added to the generic “bus”.\nIf you have to run zsh to get the cusomizations, then you’re not in the ZSH shell; likely you’re in Bash.  You can check your current shell with the commands\n$ echo $SHELL\n\nor\n\n$ echo $0\n\nWhat you need to do is change your default shell.  As soon as this command is done, check it’s permanent by restarting your OS and repeat the tests above.\n$ chsh -s /bin/zsh \n\nYou can also do this via the GUI by going to System Preferences > Users & Groups Then, while holding Control click on the user you want to edit and click on Advanced Options.  In the “Login Shell” field, select the shell you want to use - /bin/zsh for for the ZSH shell.\n\n\nA piece of friendly advice...  Oh My Zsh is a fun, colorful, and even productive add-on for Zsh that makes lots of changes and adds lots of scripts and functions to your Zsh environment.  I don’t recommend this for novices.  It’s always better to gain some experience in the shell environment and see how things work before installing things like this.\n\nA: You can do\nchsh -s $(which zsh) \n\nYou’ll need to log out, then log back in for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: just go to .bashrc file, add \"exec /bin/zsh\" at the very bottom of the line\nsave and run \"source ~/.bashrc\", it will work\n", "Q: Macbook air 2020 overheating I just got my macbook air and installed some apps on it. But it started to get hot and I don't know why. The ram usage is 5 GBs out of 16 GBs and CPU usage is about 7%. But still the bottom of my computer is hot as hell. I ran diagnostics but it told me that nothing is wrong.\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nA: The device runs internally at the boiling point, so a hot case only implies the CPU is able to run at full capacity. I’ve described it to many people that a proper device often is considered uncomfortably warm by reasonable people that aren’t familiar with how thin and power hungry the internals can be and how efficiently the heat is channeled to the metal case.\nThis review covers it well. The  i3 version should run the coolest and run the blower less urgently than the i5 or i7 but if you are not doing a stress test like this, I would still engage Apple. Unless your CPU measurement is not showing all the processes, less than 10% CPU should be an idle temp and not a loaded CPU temp of precisely “hot as hell”\n\n*\n\n*https://www.imore.com/macbook-air-2020-review-one-month-later\nTo validate your CPU be sure to show all processes in the menus and also look at energy usage over time.\n\nA: Is your fan kicking on to high speed?\nMany computers get \"hot\" but the cases are plastic (so they blow hot air out of a vent).  But the plastic case does not conduct away the heat (which isn't good) but they compensate with the stronger fan and vent.  Users get the illusion that the computer isn't hot because they don't feel the heat directly.\nThe macs use aluminum cases because the entire case can be used to help dissipate heat.  This means it is normal for it to be \"warm\" ... but \"hot\" depends on how hard the CPU cores are working.  The variable speed fans normally run on low speed but will start running faster and faster as needed to help with cooling.  The aluminum case cooling design means the users do feel the heat.  But the design is better for cooling the machine because entire case effectively becomes one big heat-sink.\nYou can launch activity monitor to determine which applications or processes are using the most CPU.\nMy personal MacBook Pros tend to get \"warm\" (if using them on my desk, I use a riser that props up the back of the mac so that the bottom doesn't sit flat on the desk.  This helps it cool from the bottom side of the case (specifically I use something called the \"Lazy Couch\" by Just-Mobile).\nMy work MacBook Pro... tends to run much hotter.  The (mandatory) security software that my company installs is ... not great.  That machine's CPUs are pegged so hard during the first 10 minutes after booting that it's basically non-responsive.\nMy suggestions are:\n\n*\n\n*If you think your machine is hot (and apparently you do) make sure the machine is able to dump the heat through the case.  This means you maximize the amount of surface area that has contact with air (especially the bottom).\n\n\n*Use Activity Monitor to determine which process(es) are responsible for driving the highest CPU utilization.  You may have things running that don't need to run.\n\n\n*There are 3rd party utilities (e.g. iStat, Fanny, etc.) that will report the actual CPU temperature.  You might consider installing one of them and checking the temperature.\nFarther down the list:\n\n*\n\n*Are your fans working?  They are normally fairly quiet ... but if the machine is \"hot\" (really hot) then you should certainly hear the sound of the fans running at high speed.  If you do not hear the fans, contact Apple for diagnostics and/or service.  (E.g. computer may be running especially hot if the fans aren't working correctly)\n\n\n*This isn't likely if it's a newer mac ... but if older ... possibly an accumulation of dust may be responsible for poor air circulation and your mac may benefit from a cleaning.\n", "Q: Figure out used swap from command line?

It opens as a new tab in the most recently used Chrome window.\nI'm interested in the answers offered at How to make Chrome open a new window for external Links. Unfortunately Comment 1 on the question says \"this solution works\" but other users report there that one or another of the multiple solutions on that page do not work for them.\nIn addition, the most recent version of Chrome mentioned in those answers is Chrome 45 and we're nearly 40 versions past that to date. So I'm asking if anyone knows of something that works, rather than experimenting with complicated, programming solutions that are already identified as not working.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Here is an option to consider...\nUse an Automator Service/Quick Action1, via Finder, to open the URL contained in the .webloc file in a new window of Google Chrome.\n1 In macOS Mojave, and later, an Automator Service is called a Quick Action.

Is there anything which may be causing this to occur?\n\nA: Check how much free storage space do you have available on your iPad. If your iPad is low on storage space, screen recording and video capture via the camera app is disabled by iOS.\nYou can check for the amount of free storage space available on your device by going to Settings app → General → iPad Storage.\nYou can re-enable screen recording by freeing up space on your iPad which could be done via the iPad Storage section.\n", "Q: iPhone and iPad says IMAP server is not responding after password change, but works on other devices I’m having a bit of a brain-scratcher with my parents’ phones and iPads. My stepmum received a notification that an attempt by someone to log in to her Google account (with the right password) had been blocked, so I started changing passwords for the accounts where variations of that password were used.\nOne of those accounts is an IMAP e-mail account associated with their website. The mail server is a simple, bog-standard IMAP server run by the host – no hosted Gmail or anything like that, just plain IMAP. Note: The problems described here also apply to the outgoing SMTP server, which is on the same domain as the IMAP server.\nThe e-mail account had been working on her iPhone and iPad for years – but when I changed the password in the website admin panel and then updated it in Settings → Accounts on the two iDevices, they both said “The mail server imap.server.com is not responding. Verify that you have entered the correct account info in Mail settings”, and I haven’t been able to get it to work since. All settings and credentials (username/password) have been confirmed in the host’s admin panel and are correct. The error is never “Incorrect username or password”, always that the server does not respond.\nThree points that boggle my mind:\n\n*\n\n*I’ve tried completely removing the account, restarting the device and adding it as a new account; it then says “Cannot connect to server using SSL” when setting up the account. Saying yes to its suggestion of trying without SSL doesn’t help; still can’t connect.\n\n\n*Setting up the same account (with completely identical settings and credentials, all verified to be correct in the host’s admin panel) works fine on my own and my dad’s iPhone and iPad, even accessing the Internet on the same network as the devices where it doesn’t work.\n\n\n*The host name has previously been in the format server1234.servercluster.com, with the subdomain corresponding to which actual server the website is hosted on in the host’s server park (i.e., if they move the site to a different server, you’ll have to change your e-mail and FTP hostnames too). Recently, they’ve added aliases of the format m123456.servercluster.com, where the subdomain is an unchanging identifier that remains the same across server transfers. Both hostnames work just fine on me and my dad’s devices; neither works on my stepmum’s.\nAs far as empiric evidence goes, then, it seems that changing the password breaks the account – even after deleting it completely – if the account has previously been installed on the device, but the same account can be added to a new device with no problems.\nI spoke to the host, who were as baffled as I am. Their only suggestion was that perhaps there was a cached SSL certificate that was screwing things up, which does sound like it’s along the right lines, but I don’t see how it can be right, given that the server’s SSL certificate hasn’t changed: it’s the same as it was a few days ago when it worked fine, before the password change.\nWhat might be causing this? Something cached somewhere on the device (and if so, how do I get rid of it)?\nA last option would be to completely reset the device, but I’d really like to avoid doing that as it would take me ages to get everything back the way it was.\n\nA: So I never figured out what exactly the problem was here, but the culprit must have been some sort of cached something on the devices.\nA few days ago, I once again edited the accounts on the devices – and lo and behold, suddenly it worked on both the iPad and the iPhone.\nSo whatever it was that was cached (?), it must have been flushed (?) after a certain amount of time had passed, and then things worked as usual. All it needed was a bit of time.\n\nA: I recently had the same (weird!) issue after changing the password for a POP-based.\nAfter some testing, I found that the following procedure reproducibly solves the issue:\n\n*\n\n*Close the Mail app\n\n*Power off the phone\n\n*Change the password of your mail account again. I mean in the web interface of your mail provider.\n\n*Power on your phone\n\n*Open the settings app and configure the new password for both receiving (POP) and sending mails (SMTP)\n\nAfter following these instructions the Mail app was synchronizing mails again properly.\n", "Q: Make safari use normal `back` and `forward` button as other browser As you might know, Safari use different short to go forward and back in history, CMD+[ and CMD+]. How do I change that to use normal back and forward button as on most mouse and other browser?\n\nA: I used karabiner elements to map button5 to cmd+] and button 4 to cmd+[ (being forward and back) but used the \"front_most_application_if\" condition for it to be only active in safari so they are still the normal buttons in other apps.\nThe code I used:https://pastebin.com/LvpZRmee\n\nA: macOS doesn't natively support using mouse buttons for forward and back. You can use gestures if you have an Apple trackpad or a magic mouse, but not buttons.\nHowever, there are a number of apps that will do this. One lightweight option is https://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net/\nP.S.

Specify \"Back\" for the menu text and then select the \"normal back\" button. (What is this button? Do you mean the arrow keys?

Each time I reboot my computer, when I run diskutil list the order of the mounted drives changes: /dev/disk0 becomes /dev/disk1 and vice versa. This creates problems for applications and scripts that depend on finding specific information in a consistent location. So far, the only (unreliable) solution is to reboot the computer hoping the paths correct themselves.\nI have also seen this question but none of the answers seemed to be a reliable long-term fix: Can I set a mount order via stab\nIs there a way to set how the drives mount on boot so they are always at the same mounting location/path?\nUpdate:\nI have found a similar question for Ubuntu here where the solution is to update the reference to drives to use their UUID. However, I have not found a similar UUID-based reference available in Mac: VirtualBox raw drive using UUID instead of device name\n\nA: \nIs there a way to set how the drives mount on boot so they are always at the same mounting location/path?\n\nYou don't need to specify the order in which they boot; you use the UUID.   To get the UUID of a drive in macOS use the command:\n% diskutil info diskXsY | grep -i UUID\n\nwhere X is the disk number (i.e. /dev/disk5) and Y is the slice or partition number (i.e. disk5s1)\nFor example, I inserted a random USB flash disk that identified as /dev/disk7.  Issuing the command as detailed above\n% diskutil info disk7s1 | grep -i UUID\nVolume UUID:               0E239BC6-F960-3107-89CF-1C97F78BB46B\nDisk / Partition UUID:     DF8CB142-B426-4F62-841C-5D26904CF54C\n\nThe Disk UUID is the second entry.\nSo, to identify this disk anytime it's been attached to the Mac, you can use the UUID.  For example:\n% diskutil list DF8CB142-B426-4F62-841C-5D26904CF54C\n/dev/disk8 (external, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *16.0 GB    disk8\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk8s1\n2:          Apple_CoreStorage MyTest                  15.7 GB    disk8s2\n3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk8s3\n\nIf you notice, it now has an identifier of disk8.  I had inserted another USB flash forcing the drive identifier to change proving that this is a valid method.\nIf you must use the drive identifier, create a function that determines the identifier via the UUID. For example, the following command will get your the disk identifier of the attached drive with the UUID:\n% diskutil list DF8CB142-B426-4F62-841C-5D26904CF54C | awk '/dev/ { print $1 } '\n\n/dev/disk8\n\nYou could create a Bash/Zsh function to return this info for you on demand.\nRegarding non-removable media...\n\nEach time I reboot my computer, when I run diskutil list the order of the mounted drives changes: /dev/disk0 becomes /dev/disk1 and vice versa\n\nI can't see this happening.  Non-removable media does not change.  Your boot device is specified in NVRAM meaning /disk0 will be what you boot from and since it's defined in the preboot environment disk0 and disk1 will not swap places.  The only time this can happen is during Recovery (you're booting from a different volume) but then, when booting from Recovery, you're not loading anything there, especially your VB app.\nNow, if you're referring to removable devices, yes, it is possible for the identifier to change (I did it in my example).  This is why you use the disk UUID to ensure you're always access the same drive regardless of when it gets attached.\n\nA: In short, it doesn't seem to be possible to set consistent disk locations. However, there are some workarounds that can be useful in certain workflows.\nFor my specific case:\nWhile Allan's response had some helpful info that played a part in the final solution, it alone was not able to solve my issue.\nThe only way I was able to solve this issue was to upgrade my scripts that launch VirtualBox to also\n\n*\n\n*Release the old virtual disk image then delete the .vmdk files\n\n*Create a new virtual disk image and set the permissions (using Allan's diskutil snippets)\n\n*Set the ownership for the new files\n\n*Update the new .vmdk files to match the old .vmdk UUID\n\n*Re-add the IDE controller and attach the .vmdk file as its medium\n\n*Launch the VM.\n\nWhile this is far more involved than I had hoped, so far this has been a much more consistent solution to the issue where the drives change their order.\nThe full script can be found below:\n  #release drives\n  dev=\"/dev/\"\n  diskUUID=<the-disk-uuid>\n  diskXs2=$dev$(diskutil list ${diskUUID} | awk 'FNR == 5 { print $7 }')\n  diskXs4=$dev$(diskutil list ${diskUUID} | awk 'FNR == 7 { print $7 }')\n  \n  if grep -qs '/Volumes/Bootcamp ' /proc/mounts; then\n      echo \"Drive '/Volumes/Bootcamp' is now unmounted.\"\n    sudo diskutil unmount /Volumes/Bootcamp\n  else\n      echo \"Drive '/Volumes/Bootcamp' is not mounted.\"\n  fi\n  sudo chmod 777 ${diskXs2}\n  sudo chmod 777 ${diskXs4\n  # Detach old disk image\n  vmUUID=\"<VM-UUID-HERE>\"\n  MAX_PORT=$(vboxmanage showvminfo ${vmUUID} |grep \"Storage Controller Max Port Count (0)\" | awk '{print $7}' );\n  vboxmanage storagectl ${vmUUID} --name 'IDE' --portcount $MAX_PORT --remove\n  \n  # Make new disk image\n  diskX=$(diskutil list ${diskUUID} | awk '/dev/ { print $1 } ')\n\n  if ls win10raw* 1> /dev/null 2>&1; then\n    rm win10raw*  \n  fi\n  sudo /usr/local/bin/VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -rawdisk ${diskX} -filename win10raw.vmdk -partitions 2,4 \n  \n  # Update the new .vmdk files to match the old .vmdk UUID\n  oldVmdkUUID=\"<OLD_UUID>\"\n  sed -i '' \"25s|.*|ddb.uuid.image=\"\"${oldVmdkUUID}\"\" |\" \"win10raw.vmdk\"\n\n  \n  if ls *.vmdk 1> /dev/null 2>&1; then\n      # echo \"files do exist\"\n    sudo chown <MY-USER> *.vmdk\n  fi\n\n  # Attach new disk image\n  /usr/local/bin/VBoxManage storagectl ${vmUUID} --name \"IDE\" --add ide\n  /usr/local/bin/VBoxManage storageattach ${vmUUID} --storagectl IDE --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium \"win10raw.vmdk\"\n\n  # Launch the VM\n   nohup /usr/local/bin/VBoxManage startvm ${vmUUID} &\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2926/get-a-list-of-all-your-virtualbox-virtual-machines-by-name-and-uuid-from-the-shell\n\n*https://www.andreafortuna.org/2019/10/24/how-to-create-a-virtualbox-vm-from-command-line/\n\n*https://organisemenet.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/bulk-delete-vbox-disk-medium/\n\n*https://mezzantrop.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/quick-reference-for-adding-and-attaching-drives-in-virtualbox-cli/\n\n*http://web.archive.org/web/20181103074214/http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html\n", "Q: Can't install command line tools on MacOS Big Sur After updating my OS to Big Sur, I tried cloning a repo.

However, when I plug in my 250GB external drive to make backups of my Mac, I incessantly get the error \"your backup drive does not have enough storage to perform the backup.\"\nMy backup drive still has 15GB free. From my understanding, older backups should be deleted to make space for newer ones. Is there any reason why Time Machine does not automatically delete the older backups to make space for the newer one?\n\nA: If you wish to delete your biggest backups (because Time Machine won't do it automatically), you can download TimeTracker, which will calculate the size of each backup, as well as show you which files are taking up space. From there, you can:\n\n*\n\n*decide to delete all backups of a file (by using the Time Machine UI and selecting \"delete all backups of 'file'\")\n\n*Add the large file(s) to System Preferences > Time Machine > Options > Ignored files\n\n*Delete an entire single backup by opening Terminal, typing sudo tmutil delete  and dragging, from finder, the backup you wish to delete.

On this machine the passwords for sites that used to be stored in the browser are no longer being offered. I have to type them in every time.\nSome sites do work properly as far as remembering cookies/logins - e.g. zillow.com - more of them do not. Examples of the latter include utexas.edu and for chase.com.  I use Chase frequently and can see it in Google Password Manager:\n\nBut I have to enter the password every time anyways\nThe keychain does seem to be working: I can see plenty of entries in it.

I am on macOS Catalina with latest chrome Version 84.0.4147.135\nUpdate Based on comment from @JBallin\n\nGo to your chrome settings. Under\"Site Settings\" - \"Cookies\" - you see an \"Allow\" button. Click on the \"add\" and then add: accounts.google.com (source) – JBallin 3 hours ago\n\nI was looking for how to \"allow\" accounts.google.com .  I do not see an \"allow\" button\n\nUpdate again: now I foudn this under Cookies and other site data - and added accounts.google.com (i had previously added 2 sites that are still not working):\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue, it was a conflict between the keychain and Google chrome account password.\nMake sure to allow the use of the password from the keychain, from the popup that appears after a computer reboot.\n\nA: \"Keychain\" is an app that runs on macOS. It interfaces only with macOS and iOS apps that come from Apple, such as Safari — it does not connect to or act with software like Chrome that doesn't come from Apple.\nGoogle Password Manager does password management with Chrome, including Chrome running on macOS.\nOn this stack, the tag \"Keychain\" refers to Keychain the Apple app, not to password managers generally. You should delete this tag, and substitute the tag \"Password.\"\n", "Q: Can’t restore Time Machine back up - an error occurred while adding recovery system to destination disk Just upgraded my 2012(mid) non-retina  13” MacBook Pro with a crucial\nsad 1tb and having troubles restoring back up from Time machine.

Currently when printing a document the Layout Two-side options are Off, Long-Edge binding, Short-edge binding and Booklet, see image\n\nI want to add the single page booklet, which works like the image below.\n\nWhat options exist to customize this on macOS?\n\nA: According to another stack exchange question thread, it looks like these options are in fact provided by the printer drivers rather than the app you use to print.\nHere a user mentions:\n\nThat option will only be available for printers that offer duplexing and automatic booklet making. Booklets made by printer drivers may place each page inside the print area of the sheet, thus scaling the pages to be smaller than necessary.\n\nand in this answer's comment thread one user claims that they don't have the booklet option. Another user then claims that the booklet option comes from the printer drivers at their work.\nIf you wanted to make a new layout, your best bet is to make a template document in your word processing app of choice (Pages, Word, LaTex, etc) and then save it. Then always open that document and save a copy, then create your one page booklet by adding images/text/etc to the copy, so you can keep using the original as a template.\n\nA: The process of placing pages on a sheet is called Imposition. \"Mutiple-fold\" imposition of this kind is usually done only in commercial and large-scale printing, because the more pages on your sheet, the bigger the sheet needs to be. (An A3 sheet folded 3 times gives you a tiny A6 page. Your HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 only does A4!)\nLarge-scale printing devices may have options in their drivers to impose pages. There is also standalone Imposition software, which tends to manipulate PDFs as part of a pre-press workflow. That's probably your best bet for adding this feature.\nThere are plenty of cheap or free Imposition apps, which you can search for: though many of them will only do 4-page-per-sheet booklet, e.g. A4 page on A3 sheet. More complex imposition apps tend to be quite expensive (Imposition Wizard is $559, or $260 p.a.; Imposition Studio Digital on the Mac App Store is c. $250 -- and that's a 'Light' version of the $450 app!) because they are geared to commercial work.\nAdobe's InDesign comes with Imposition built-in to its print options. There are also Adobe Acrobat imposition plug-ins.\nIf you are sending your PDFs to a commercial printer, then they will deal with the imposition that they need for their equipment.\nIt would be possible to write a script using MacOS CoreGraphics APIs (in python, AppleScriptObjC, or Swift) that would perform the necessary imposition on a PDF document.\n", "Q: Setting speed of effects There are some effects in osx.

Am I missing a configuration? Or is the only solution to use another remote viewer/controller software?\n\nA: I had the same issue with copy/paste using VNC Viewer from Windows to MacOS. It looks like you have to pay for VNC Server to get it working.\nInstead I moved to Chrome Remote Desktop (so this doesn't answer the specific question, but is too long for comments). There seem to be two issues with this - one fixable and one not.\nThe issue I couldn't fix was that you will see a Window with \"Your desktop is currently shared with...\". I dragged this to the bottom right of the screen to hide it as much as possible, but you have to repeat this with every restart.\nThe second issue is that (obviously) the Windows key does not map to the Command key. This is \"fixed\" by choosing another key under \"Configure key mappings\". I chose to map ControlLeft to MetaLeft, and so then Ctl-C and Ctl-V (etc) worked fine.\nChrome Remote Desktop also solves one of your other issues - you can transfer files (although I have not used).\n", "Q: Can't delete old Time Machine backups from Trash I was trying to delete some old Time Machine backups from my backup drive.

I also tried to update from Mojave to Catalina in the idea that this might fix the issue.\nDoes somebody else encounter this issue? \nConfiguration:\nMacbook pro late 2013 with OS 10.15.6 (19G2005)\n2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2 GB\nIntel Iris Pro 1536 MB\nIs there a way of seeing the processes used or what is being done by the system? The Activity monitor or the htop from brew doesn't show what is being done by the system. --\nAnswer (based on the comment from @At0mic): In order to see all processes including the system ones it possible by selecting in Activity Monitor View -> Show all processes\n\n\nA: What you're seeing is not \"the system\" (as a separate entity) using up your CPU time so that \"your programs\" are not getting their fair share. This is not what happens.\nIn order to interpret the screenshot, you'll need to know that modern computers are designed to have their work load split between what is known as \"user space\" and \"system space\" (also known as kernel space). This is a form of protection.\nThe programs you're running will have their code running in \"user space\" consuming \"user CPU time\". This would involve the various computations and data juggling that your program does by itself.\nHowever most programs do not live on an island. They need to access privileged resources such as a reading files from a disk, sending information on a network, etc. To do this safely, they need to ask the system to perform these tasks for them. In doing so work is transitioned to \"system space\" and thus taking up \"system CPU time\".\nActivity Monitor shows you this split of your CPU usage. 70% is used in \"system space\", 20% in \"user space\" and approx. 10% \"idle\" in your case.\nThis does not mean that \"the system\" is somehow sucking up 70% of the CPU time taking it away from your programs - rather it means your programs have asked the system to do stuff for them - and that takes 70% of the CPU time.\nIn the top part of Activity Monitor you'll see the percentages of CPU time that each program has used. This percentage is based on the SUM of the process' usage of both user and system CPU time.\n\nA: Chrome is gobbling up your CPU, look how many processes it is running. Chrome is known to be a CPU intensive browser because it runs every tab and every extension as a standalone process. It increases app’s stability but makes your computer rather slow.\nUninstall all but essential two or three extensions, and try not to run multiple tabs. I had to do the same for myself, so far there aren’t better solutions (besides upgrading your CPU). I alternate between Safari and Chrome depending on the task at hand, while also monitoring my computer’s CPU load. Safari can generally handle more tabs with less CPU.\nYou could also use Chrome’s built-in Task Manager (as an alternative to Activity Monitor) to see which resources each task is using up. It has over 20 categories of stats. In Chrome, click the “More” button (three dots), hover over “More Tools,” and then click on “Task Manager.”\n\n\nA: Ok so the main problem that was causing a high load of CPU was from the kernel_task process which was using so much because of the peripherical connections. Based on this answer I just disconnected everything and after a few minutes went back to normal.\n", "Q: Screen Time - How do you allow specific websites for Safari? Most of the posts I've seen around this saying it's not possible are a couple of years old; have there been any new changes with how Screen Time works with Safari? I've been unsuccessful in finding a way to permit specific websites for my daughter's iPad, so I'm constantly getting requests for all of the different sites she needs for school that day.\nI know one option is to use a different browser, but how does that affect content restrictions? Does using a browser other than Safari in any way also circumvent the protection from accessing sites that contain adult content?\n\nA: You should be able to access Prevent web content in Screen Time. See my summary below or follow a step by step guide here.\niOS can automatically filter website content to limit access to adult content in Safari and apps on your device.

But the AppleScript doesn't work.\nSpecifically, I'm trying to click the Set as system proxy item of ClashX.app.\n\nand the item path is showed as below:\n\nMy AppleScript (sorry IDK the corr. syntax highlight):\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    tell application \"ClashX\" \n        tell process \"ClashX\"\n            click menu item \"Set as system proxy\" of menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nand it comes out\nSyntax Error: Expected end of line but found “\"”.\n\nNote: the process name seems to be \"ClashX\", but I'm newbie to OS, so I post it here FYI.\n\n\nA: The following example AppleScript code is how you'd click that target menu item:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"ClashX\"\n    click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n    click menu item \"Set as system proxy\" of menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\nend tell\n\nThat said though, sometimes there can be a delay of several seconds, or more, between the first click and the second click.

Also, you actually may not want a given application to have accessibility privileges for security reasons.\nTo work around the accessibility privileges issues in a use case such as this I avoid Automator and just use an AppleScript script triggered by a keyboard shortcut using e.g. FastScripts, or a similar type of application. Using FastScripts I find that I typically only have to give it accessibility privileges and not the application that was frontmost when the keyboard shortcut was triggered.\nThis still leaves the global keyboard shortcut issue though and you may end up having to use four or five keys and the non-modifier key will most likely have to be a symbol.\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with the developer of FastScripts, just a satisfied user of the product.\n\nA: The click command cannot be performed by the application ClashX.

Then connect your iPad to your Mac with a USB-lightning cable and run Coconut Battery. Click on \"ios device\" on the top of the Coconut battery display on your mac and this will tell you much about the battery in your ios device.\nIf you don't have a Mac go to the App Store and search on battery. There are many apps that claim to give you info about your battery. These provide different levels of information so you'll have to search for one that provides you with what you want. Many are free so there is plenty to try.

I have a microphone and Soundflower installed, and an aggregate device set up in Audio MIDI setup to mix the two together. My mic has two channels, and Soundflower has both a 2 channel and a 64 channel device. I just put them all together.\n\nThe problem is, I'm trying to use this as a \"mic\" input for Microsoft Teams (which does not support multi-channel input audio), which seems to only use one channel.

Also most importantly my 1Password data is in iCloud.\nMy new employer is forcing me to use a company MacBook which is a 'managed Mac' meaning everything is controlled by the employer.\nWhat should I do, just sign into my personal iCloud account and hope for the best or do you think my employer could access all this data?\n\nA: From your personal iCloud account share a folder with only work-related files to a company supplied AppleID/iCloud account running on the managed MacBook.\nAt a moments notice your work-owned Managed MacBook could be deleted or locked.\nIt is their property and possible agreements regarding its use may include any data on the machine.\nWhy else do you need your personal information on the work Machine?\nUse your personal machine for personal stuff.\nYou will probably be a much more productive employee when you are not accessing your personal stuff when at work, or when working.\n\nA: Of course they can access. They can potentially access even if you delete your synced data, because your data might end up being stored in system logs, cache, hidden folders, and even deleted data can be recovered with special software.\nI myself recently stumbled upon my old work emails from two years ago on my personal Mac. This is despite my work login has been disabled for two years. But I haven’t used Outlook on my personal Mac since then, I recently opened it and it restored all my work emails from some archived folder.\nDon’t share your personal folders either. Create a shareable folder from your work account and share it with your personal account if you need to access work files from home.\n\nA: With a managed Mac where \"everything is controlled by the employer\", the employer could technically access your personal data stored on that Mac - yes. It doesn't matter if the data comes from iCloud or other places.\nNote that your employer probably does not access your personal data, and depending on where you live and what you agreements are, it is probably not legal for them to do so. However, it is very probable that they could access the data given the necessary intent and technical knowledge.\nMy advice would be not to store any personal data on a company laptop, unless you wouldn't mind your employer or a system administration to stumble upon that data.\n", "Q: Control Video Speed on VLC conveniently I prefer changing the video speed on VLC on my MacOS but pressing them once increases/decreases the speed by 0.5x  which is quite troublesome.

Of course, you can trust Homebrew  But do you trust the multi-megabyte Makefile that Homebrew runs? Developers often understand C++ far better than they understand make syntax. It’s too high a risk to sudo such stuff. It could modify (or upload) any files on your system. And indeed, we’ve seen some build scripts try to modify /usr even when the prefix was specified as something else entirely.\nWe use the macOS sandbox to stop this but this doesn’t work when run as the root user (which also has read and write access to almost everything on the system).\nDid you chown root /Applications/TextMate.app? Probably not. So is it that important to chown root wget?\nIf you need to run Homebrew in a multi-user environment, consider creating a separate user account especially for use of Homebrew.\n\nMoreover, Homebrew services are built and configured to run with user accounts, if you run them under the root account you risk to have configuration problems as you experienced. Also, as you should already known, running internet facing services, under a root account is a major security risk.\n", "Q: iOS user css stylesheets for Safari On macOS and other desktop systems you can override the CSS from a website and add yor preferences -- change the header font, line spacing, text colour etc.\nIs there away to do this automatically per site on the iPad?\nThere is a question Is CSS injection possible on iPad using Safari? similar but this requires opening the page first then running a shortcut for each page.

This question is regarding Apple rejecting the latest build of our iOS app and trying to find the best way to appeal the rejection. Here is the background:\nMy company has an iOS app that is used by our sales staff (internal company employees) to manage their day to day pipeline while on the go. Since the app is a major competitive advantage in the specific industry, we also advertise it to attract new sales people to come work for us. In order to have them experience the tech, we ask them to download the app, login with temporary credentials tied to their personal email IDs and play around with dummy data inside the app. Since we need the app to be publicly available for these individuals, we have so far published the app on the public app store instead of an enterprise store. While Apple approved our initial build about a year back and all subsequent updates, it recently rejected our latest build citing that the app should be in an enterprise store since it is being used for internal employees. While that does make sense given their policies, we are in a bind since the app also is used heavily in the recruitment process and hence needs to be available publicly.\nHas anyone come across a similar situation with Apple? It's not clear why Apple suddenly decided to reject the app after having approved it multiple times over the last year. Were you able to convince Apple to reconsider the rejection, or is it a fruitless exercise?\n\nA: You could reply to Apple stating that the app actually is not used exclusively by internal employees - but rather is made available publicly for marketing/recruiting purposes. I have often seen that Apple's initial request for further information and clarification results in them approving the app update afterall.\nHowever, if you are forced to switch to the enterprise model - don't worry at all. You can still offer access to potential employees. You would then just host the app on your own web site (or any web site you have lying around really) - and just send the potential employee a link to install the app.\n\nA: It’s likely the person who was reviewing your app didn’t understand the specifics and made a snap judgement to reject the app. This happens. Make an appeal, given your app has been greenlighted for a year, this should be straight-forward. If it gets rejected again, speak to Apple and just explain the situation in plain English and ask to reconsider.\n", "Q: When I decompress a zip file on my Mac, the folder is nowhere to be found.

Now what?\n\nA: There are two options. The important part is to determine if you need to get a new @icloud or @me or @mac portion of the email. You can’t change that yourself.\nYou can change the AppleID (log in text) and everything else like name and address, just not the initial email Apple issued to your iCloud account. That portion isn’t editable any manner I’ve ever seen, and if you use a third party mail with your AppleID you can change that to a new value and leave the old email behind forever.\nAssuming you can’t edit the fields you want, two options remain:\n\n*\n\n*Make a new AppleID and have the other hang around for past purchases - you have to keep control of it, but not use it for primary. Make it part of the “family” if you want purchases to flow to the new account.\n\n*Make a new AppleID and just delete / leave it unused. Clean start.\n\nI would call Apple Support or chat if any of this is unclear or confusing. Show them the exact parts you want to change before you do anything. They can advise you best since they manage the service and you don’t have to share personal details here publicly.\n\nA: You can change or delete an email alias, and you can sign in to iCloud with either your @icloud.com email address or the Apple ID that you use with your iCloud account (this can be changed to any email address of yours, e.g. Gmail).\n@icloud.com email address that is not an alias cannot be deleted. But you could just not use it. If you change your Apple ID and create a new @icloud.com email alias, your divorced name account will only be shown to you in your settings, it won’t be publicly visible unless you show it, and you don’t have to use it.\nI’m in a similar situation myself due to last name change.

I have an external hard drive already, and I'm looking to move my library to live only on the external hard drive to free up space on my computer's.\nBecause of the size of the library I wanted to organize it better, and create individual libraries for each year, and for certain events. I also figure this will help avoid any issues with it getting stuck while copying such a large number of pictures, if I'm not trying to do all 20,000 at once. I created albums that represented what I wanted the new libraries to be (one for each year) and put all those photos from that year in.\nThe issue I'm having is that when I copy the photos from the albums into the new libraries on my hard drive using the Power Photos app, it removes all duplicates. For most people this would be desired, however, although I do sometimes use outside applications, I edit many photos simply using the photos editing tools since I usually only want a few light and color adjustments. Before I edit a photo, I always duplicate it and edit the duplicate so that I have the original, and if I decide I don't like the edit or I want to consider a different way to edit it I still have the original image to use for those purposes. Whenever Power Photos removes all of the duplicates, it removes the photos I've edited, which I obviously don't want.\nIs there any way around this? I tried removing the \"version 2\" title from a duplicate and that did not work, and I thought that renaming the duplicate photo may work but I can't find where to rename an image in photos.\n\nA: This isn't ideal and I can't guaranteed it working in this case, but this is the roundabout solution that I go for when I want to stop any given OS molesting my files: Zip it. If you put the files that Power Photos is deleting in to a zip, move that zip to the external drive, and then uncompress (unzip), you should end up with the duplicates on the external drive. If you can then copy the unzipped files in to the albums that you want them to be in, your problem should be solved.\nAlso, are you sure that PowerPhotos is the right tool for this job? I commonly see it deleting duplicates advertised as a feature, rather than as something that you're supposed to avoid.\n", "Q: Okay to leave iPhone on a Qi charger while at 100% battery level? I have a Mophie brand Qi charger for use with my new iPhone SE (2020).\nAfter being left on the Qi charger I notice the iPhone is warm to the touch. I find this warmth even when the phone has been fully charged (at 100% battery level) for some time such as left overnight.\nThat warmth made me wonder if it is okay to use the Qi charger as my primary charger, and to leave the phone charging indefinitely.\n\nA: Yes, it is totally safe to do so. Your phone won't suddenly overheat, \"overcharge\" or break due to it being placed for a prolonged amount of time on a Qi-charger while fully charged.\n\nA: \nThat warmth made me wonder if it is okay to use the Qi charger as my primary charger, and to leave the phone charging indefinitely.\n\nYes, you can do this.\nIt is perfectly safe to leave your phone charging on the wireless charger.  The warmth you feel is perfectly normal.\nBattery Health\nFrom the battery perspective, iOS will manage the charging of the battery with the Battery Health feature.\n\nAll iPhone models include fundamental performance management to ensure that the battery and overall system operates as designed and internal components are protected. This includes behavior in hot or cold temperatures, as well as internal voltage management. This type of performance management is required for safety and expected function, and cannot be turned off.\n\nHow Qi Chargers work\nQi chargers work through a electromagnetic property called induction whereby a magnetic field passed over an electrical conductor produces an electromotive force.  In other words, a magnetic field passed over some wire will produce voltage and vice versa.  These chargers work by creating a electromagnetic field by passing voltage through a coil (transmitter).  Then that field is put near another coil to produce voltage (receiver).\nInside your phone is a coil of wire, that when lined up with the charging pad/mat that has it's own coil, will produce 5V of electricity to charge your phone.  This coil is connected to the charging circuitry of your phone along with the USB charger connection.  That voltage that's created by the coil is sent by the charging circuit to your battery where it charges until it's full; then it stops charging as it would if you had hooked up your device to a USB charger.  I go into this into more detail in the answer to Are iPhone Wireless Chargers Good for Batteries?\n\nThis is no different than your USB charger remaining plugged in when the device is fully charged.\nThis topic has been asked and answered here on Ask Different already.  Whether the current is coming from a USB/Lightning port or from a Qi charging coil, the battery doesn't know or care; the electrical properties are still the same:\n\n*\n\n*Should I disconnect my MacBook Pro's power cord when the battery is fully charged?\n\n\n*Is it safe to charge a MacBook Air after the green LED shows?\n\n\n*How to charge AirPods to keep battery healthy?\n\n\n*MacBook Pro randomly discharges from 100% to ~90% when plugged\nNow, the warmth that you're feeling is normal.  The coil is still producing electromotive force if the charging pad is not turned off.  However, that voltage isn't being used so it has to be dissipated and it does this via heat.  Additionally, the simple act of moving electrons down a conductor will generate heat through friction.  This is perfectly normal.  In fact, on regular mains sourced power supplies, those too become warm as the transformer (what goes from 120/240 mains to 5VDC) continues to operate with nothing connected.\n", "Q: mp4 H264 video won't play in iPhone safari I have a video hosted online, and when I try to open it with Safari, it won't play (I got a crossed paly icon). When I put this video on the iCloud drive and open it with the Files app, it plays without an issue (on the same iPhone). In fact, it's a video recorded by that iPhone, exported from the Mac Photos app, and re-packaged from .mov to .mp4 so more devices should be able to play it. Is there some special format for the videos that mobile Safari can play?\n\n\nA: MP4 is a container format, while H. 264 is a video compression codec. So to play H. 264 in Safari, you will need a video container like MP4 to host the encoded video.\nSettings based on the MPEG-4 format offer a choice of two encoders: H.264 and HEVC (High-Efficiency Video Coding, also known as H.265). When you add an MPEG-4-based setting to a job, Compressor chooses the H.264 format as the default codec. You can change the codec to HEVC in the Video inspector if your computer is running macOS 10.13 or later. HEVC is a recently established compression standard that supports larger frame sizes (including 8K) and HDR10 metadata for high-dynamic-range video. HEVC playback requires a recent-generation Apple device running macOS 10.13 or later, iOS 11 or later, iPadOS 13 or later, or tvOS 11 or later.\n\nA: The official Apple documentation for video content in Safari can be found in the below article\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/safari_tools_and_features/delivering_video_content_for_safari\n", "Q: Distnoted terminal message I booted my Mac in Verbose Mode (command v) to see a live report for when my Mac is booting up. There, I found a “message in the bottle”, evidently left there by an Apple developer:\n(com.apple.disnoted.xpc.agent) <Notice>: This service is defined to be constantly running and is inherently inefficient. \nDistnoted provides “distributed notification services”. Distnoted is a perfectly benign process, but it can occasionally consume resources and make your Mac slow down, which is evidenced by multiple threads in Apple discussion forums linking CPU intensive processes to Distnoted.\nIf anyone could explain to me why the function needs to be constantly running (as opposed to when triggered by an incoming notification), what makes it resource intensive (my first impression is that notifications shouldn’t take up much CPU), and suggest ways how to optimize the resource usage.\nMac mini, macOS 10.15\n\nA: Distnoted is a daemon and it’s designed to run on demand since you see the XPC framework is being invoked.\nThis is a wonderfully technical part of operating system design. Some of the best and accessible writing on why things run, how they run and why this can be very lightweight and efficient despite logging hundreds or thousands of messages is described here by Apple.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\nFrom a overall health perspective, you choose what apps run and how many notifications they generate, so the work assigned to this process only happens when you have notifications to deliver and it can idle otherwise.\nTo optimize your experience, you can log out and terminate all user apps and processed from terminal - sudo launchctl reboot userspace and then validate the daemon is idle by ssh back in to watch the CPU with top -u -s 10 and ps -ef | grep distnote[d]\n", "Q: Does IOS Dictation Database Contain “UGH” I recently had someone reply to me over text and they claim “speech” to text wrote “ugh” instead of “huh”. It was part of a text that offended me by how it was written and I believe they intentionally wrote “ugh”, even though they claim otherwise. This person uses “ugh” quite often to portray or describe displeasure.\nI’ve tried multiple times to get speech to text to produce “ugh” and I don’t think its in IOS natural database to do so.\nI know you can manually make IOS learn words, but it’s not in their accessibility database as an entry.\n\nA: Ugh / huh / aah is easily produced by dictation from similar sounds even in an exceptionally quiet environment with clear diction. (i.e. Works on iPad and Apple Watch and iPhone for me.)\nHow Apple engineered the system is probably a lot more complicated than you’ve written, but there’s no technical gotcha I can see that would reinforce any mistrust of said person.\nIn my experience, Siri is extremely flexible with accents and has to juggle many inputs / guess contextually what a sound actually means to produce text that in the end looks identical to a very intentionally typed statement.\nFor decades to come I think we all will continue to be part of experiments to help Apple wreck a nice beach.\n", "Q: How to open iterm from Finder?

Decided to try pinging it again, and my phone finally did beep, in the kitchen.\n\n*\n\n*Why was my watch, paired only to my phone, able to make another phone beep?\n\n*While it was inconvenient at the moment and a little worrisome, being able to locate multiple phones in a household with the watch would be could be convenient if I knew how to control it.  How can I specify from the watch, which phone to locate?\n\n\nA: The watch only pings one phone in my experience (but many watches can pair and ping to one phone)- the phone it paired to from the Watch app. I would first start by looking at each phone in question - check which watches are paired to which phone.\n\nTo confirm, I assume are using this tap to summon the phone.\n\nOn the fixing, I always like to unpair the watch on the phone I have as primary.

The battery icon on the top right displays an X with \"No battery available\". This is mirrored in the System Information interface under Power, where all values for this section display \"No\" and \"0\" (as in the battery is not recognized).

My other computer and phone/tablet already have the files\nIt is uploading 1.94 GB and the number of items is decreasing rapidly. My guess is it is figuring itself out\n\nA: iCloud needs to check that the restore from backup is the same as the current state on iCloud Drive, so it's not uploading the entire file where it already exists on iCloud Drive but instead just comparing hashes.\nThis process should be much faster than re-uploading the entire iCloud Drive contents. The progress reported by Finder (in GB) is the size of the files that still need to be checked, not the amount that will be transmitted over the network.\nThis will also happen in other circumstances where iCloud loses track of the local copy of the drive, such as after a logout of iCloud.\n", "Q: My Mac 3,1 isn't recognizing one CPU - Dual Xeon I have a mac 3,1 with dual Xeon's.

Boot the system up and check that it works, and that System Information says 1 processor.\nThen shut the Mac down again, unplug power - and carefully replug the second CPU. Boot up again and check System Information for the Processor Count.\nIf it still says 1 CPU, your problem is most likely either a defective CPU or a defective socket. The easiest way to check if to try with a different CPU. Perhaps you can get one cheap off eBay or perhaps you have access to one.\nIf it is a defective socket, then your options are very limited.

It currently runs on macOS Catalina. As root, when I try to delete the sleep image I get the message \"Operation not permitted\".\nCan someone help answer how do I delete the sleep image?\n\nA: TL;DR    Under macOS Catalina, to remove the sleepimage file using Terminal while booted normally to your Desktop, use the following command:\nsudo pmset hibernatemode 0\n\n\n\nTested under a macOS Catalina (10.15.6) system, without FileVault, the following was all that was necessary to remove the sleepimage file, typically located at: /var/vm/sleepimage\nNote that this was done in a normal mode boot and booting to macOS Recovery and disabling System Integrity Protection was not needed. Even if booted to macOS Recovery, one does not need to disable System Integrity Protection in order to delete the sleepimage file from there.\nBooted to my normal Desktop, in Terminal I ran the following commands to show it can be done as advertised:\n~ % pmset -g | grep 'hibernatefile\\|hibernatemode'\n hibernatemode        3\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n~ % ls /var/vm/\nkernelcore  sleepimage\n~ % sudo pmset hibernatemode 0\nPassword:\n~ % ls /var/vm/               \nkernelcore\n~ % \n\n\n*\n\n*Setting hibernatemode to 0 automatically removed the sleepimage file.\n\n*Setting hibernatemode back to 3 recreated the sleepimage file.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*The system I used did not have FileVault enabled, however, I doubt it would make any difference if it did.\n\n*Tested under normal mode boot in macOS High Sierra after using sudo pmset hibernatemode 0, I had to manually delete the sleepimage file using: sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\n*Did not test under macOS Mojave, however, one of the methods used under macOS High Sierra or macOS Catalina should work.\n\n\nTo remove the sleepimage file from macOS Recovery in macOS Catalina 10.15.6, without FileVault, I tested the following without disabling System Integrity Protection.\n\n*\n\n*Booted to macOS Recovery\n\n*Opened Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*Ran diskutil list to ascertain which disk was APFS Volume VM.

Since upgrading to Catalina, the App Store keeps its notification badge despite the app update automatically being installed in the background. Opening the App Store clears this badge and it will stay clear until the next update comes out (where it'll be installed automatically, so the badge is irrelevant).\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Is this the intended behavior, or is this an obscure bug?\n\n*If it is the intended behavior, does anyone know how to disable this while keeping automatic updates enabled?\n\n\nA: I believe it’s a bug (not sure what would make it an “obscure bug”) and you should submit feedback to Apple at https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html\nThe reson I believe it to be a bug is because if you immediately open the App store, the erroneous badge immediately disappears meaning that upon launch of the app, it correctly indicates that there are none.  In fact, it appears that the badge is “reset” as it checks for updates with the update server.  I have personally seen mine go from 4 updates, then upon opening the App store, the badge disappear and then a few seconds later change to 1 update.\nIt’s entirely possible that the badge doesn’t update until the next automatic update check.\nI don’t believe this to be intended behavior and obviously a nuisance, but it’s nothing that affects functionality.  You can easily fix the badge by opening and closing the App Store app.  I submitted feedback regarding this and I encourage you to do so as well.\n", "Q: Is there any way that we could load disk utility or any disk repair tool from a USB in mac? Recently my Mac crashed due to kernel panic. I tried using disk utility to repair the disk but the parent disk couldn't be repaired. And I opened up the terminal and erased the current boot disk.

The USB boots up just fine and allows me to get to the part of the Windows installation where I am asked to select which disk to install the OS onto. The issue, I am running into, is no disks are displayed. I used the Boot Camp Assistant to download the WindowsSupport directory and then added this directory to the USB drive. While the WindowsSupport directory does contain an AppleSSD64 driver in a subdirectory, the driver does not appear to function or allow the OS to detect the drive. I am running into much the same problem as detailed at Apple Support Communities.\nThe drive is 256 GB total in size and I have a windows partition formatted to exFat to try to allow the installer to detect it. I also manually used fdisk to ensure a hybrid MBR partition scheme is not used, as detailed here. Despite all of my efforts, I cannot get the installer to recognize my computers hard drive. I have downloaded the Windows 10 ISO repeatedly from Microsoft and I am sure it is not corrupt. I do not have any idea what is going on.\nThe end goal of this process is to get Windows only running on my Mac, I do not want a macOS partition due to the limited hard drive space available, which is why I am attempting to install the whole thing from a bootable USB instead of employing the Boot Camp Assistant.\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Your link https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8269886 contains the image shown below.\n\nThe $WinPEDriver$ folder should be in the root folder. There should not be a WindowsSupport folder. In other words, I would expect to see the path shown below.\nD:\\$WinPEDriver$\\AppleSSD64\\AppleSSD.inf\n\nYou are suppose to copy the contents of the WindowsSupport folder to the root folder of the flash drive containing the Windows 10 installation files. The image shows the WindowsSupport folder was copied instead, which is incorrect.\nA Windows installation can fail if the wrong Window Support Software is being use. The best way to insure you are using the correct Windows Support Software is to use the Boot Camp Assistant installed on the same Mac that is going to run Windows 10. There is a option on the Boot Camp Assistant menu bar for downloading the Window Support Software. I should point out this is not the only way to acquire the Windows Support Software.\nHigh Sierra and newer versions of macOS no longer hybrid partition a drive when creating a ExFAT partition. Since you only want Windows on your Mac, then you can use the USB Windows installer to erase your entire drive before installing Windows. This would make any previous hybrid partitioning irrelevant anyway.\n", "Q: \"No PDFs\" in iBooks on ipad; i.e. PDFs don't persist in Library PDFs instantly disappear in iBooks after I click out of them.\nIn particular, I can read PDFs by going into the \"Files\" app, going to my icloud drive, clicking a pdf, then clicking \"open in ibooks\".

How can I get my Library -> PDFs screen in ibooks to actually show the PDFs that I have been reading, instead of having them instantly disappear? Currently, in order to read the PDF again, I have to go to the Files app, and click \"open in ibooks\" every time.\nI'm using ibooks on ipad air 2, with the latest system upgrades as of late August 2020.\n\nA: By default, PDFs don't persist in the Books app. In the Files app, opening a PDF with Books will make the Books app open the PDF from its existing location.\nTo copy the PDF into the Books app, with the book open in the Books app, tap the Share button, then ‘Copy to Books’.

Since I fresh-installed macOS Catalina on my MacBook Pro, I've noticed a strange process called AXVisualSupportAgent slowly eating up my RAM little by little. Upon a fresh reboot it doesn't seem to be consuming too many resources. However, as time goes on its memory usage starts creeping up. My machine has been on for a week and it's already using half of my available 16GB RAM, which is probably being swapped quite a lot. Any ideas about why this may be the case, and how I can prevent this from happening? I don't want to reboot my laptop every few weeks to give it \"proper maintenance\" as I would need to with a Windows laptop.\n\n\nA: I don't know what the process does but this reference has a description of a way to prevent it from using a lot of cpu time. The process is related to the accessibility settings on your computer. To reduce the time taken open system preferences and click on accessibility. Turn off the zoom function and turn off image smoothing. There are other things listed in the link. The link is originally in Japanese but the googletranslation was pretty good I think. It was also mentioned that the problem really started with Catalina.\n\nA: I followed the previous answer (I'm on Catalina 10.15.7), and turning off \"Use keyboards shortcuts to zoom\" in the Zoom section (image smoothing was already off under Advanced > Appearance) and disabling Voice Control caused AXVisualSupportAgent to disappear from Activity Monitor altogether.\nI then re-enabled \"Use keyboards shortcuts to zoom\" and the process reappeared, but running at about 0.1% CPU.\nI then re-enabled Voice Control and a little microphone icon appeared bottom-right on my screen that wasn't there before.  I also got prompted \"A 422 MB download is required to use speech recognition features in Dictation\" so I disabled Voice Control and cancelled the download.  Also interesting to note that the microphone selected by Voice Control was the USB Advanced Audio Device in my Plugable UD-CA1 powered hub, not my internal mic.\nThe behaviour when I re-enabled Voice Control suggests to me that it wasn't properly initialised when I disabled it, so perhaps that's what was triggering the CPU hogging.  But since I don't want to use dictation I'm not going to spend the time investigating further.  If you do, and loading that 422MB chunk fixes thing for you, please leave a comment to let the Community know.  Thanks.\n\nA: I've found a workable solution for this: One can set up a Launch Agent to run a script every 30 minutes to /usr/bin/killall -HUP AXVisualSupportAgent.\nThis can be done easily via a tool like Lingon X or any other method to create such an agent or crontab entry.\n", "Q: Mac Preview-- Cannot drag note icon while highlighting pdf I am trying to annotate pdf on Preview and when I add note a highlighted text, I cannot drag or reposition the note icon (box). I have attached a screen shot to explain my question.\nIs it a bug or feature ? because I can move the Note icon if I add a note separately (not combined with the highlighted text)\n.\n\nA: Unfortunately this seems to be a (rather ill-implemented) feature. You can test it out by right-clicking on the highlight and changing the color—you'll see that the color of the note changes as well. It's ill-implemented in my opinion because it hides text underneath the note icon.\nI would recommend you to add notes and highlights separately with different colors to differentiate them.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a third-party app which shows notes associated with highlights much better, like PDF Expert:\n\nHowever, to add or save the notes (instead of just viewing them), you'll need to buy the full version for a hefty $80.\n", "Q: How can I connect my Mac to my iPhone hotspot via USB from the command line? About a mont ago, my Mac's wifi stopped working for unknown reasons. I was recommended to do a clean install, but I need internet connection to run the installer from the recovery menu, so I want to get to the internet by using the iPhone mobile data.\nIs there a way to connect to the internet by sharing the iPhone data over USB?\nI know I can reinstall from an USB drive, but I've already erased the main HD and I'm stuck here.\n\nA: If you’ve already erased your hard drive then there’s no “command line” to use to begin with.  You need a minimal operating system in which to boot into and it sounds like you don’t have that.\nHere are a few options for you to move forward:\n\n*\n\n*Get a USB Ethernet or USB WiFi dongle (I suggest Ethernet) to connect your Mac directly into your router/modem so you can do the Internet Recovery.\n\n\n*Obtain a USB installer from a trusted source (friend/colleague)\n\n\n*Put your Mac in Target Disk Mode and using another the other Mac, install macOS onto that machine. Alternatively, if the drive in your Mac is removable and you have the correct USB enclosure/adapter connect it to another Mac and install macOS onto it.\nRegarding your WiFi....\nReinstalling an OS, regardless if it’s macOS, Windows, Linux, etc. is the absolutely last thing you should try.  It’s a “Hail Mary pass” type of move because the person diagnosing the problem is out of ideas.  It rarely solves the problem because if it does start working again, you haven’t identified what caused the issue to begin with to prevent it in the future.\nIn your case, resintalling won’t fix it because you’re not in macOS anywhere and you still cannot connect to WiFi for recovery.  If it doesn’t work in this “bare minimum mode“ it’s not going to work when the full OS is loaded.  The thing is, you didn’t have to erase the drive to find this out.  All you had to do was boot into Recovery to test it out.\nI wrote this not as an admonishment, but as a cautionary tale to you and future readers.  If you’re being told, especially initially that “the fix is to resinstall” stop and look elsewhere; seek better guidance.  I’m not saying that it’s never the answer; I’m saying it shouldn’t be the first go to.\nThis is the equivalent to having a plumbing or electrical issue in your house and the contractor tells you that you need to demolish and rebuild the whole house  to fix it.  In this case, normally it would be ridiculous  to do that, but if the entire house had sub-standard or dangerous wiring (like wrapped in asbestos), demolishing might make sense.  It should be your last option after everything else is attempted/evaluated.\n", "Q: 0% GPU Usage on iMac 2019 with Radeon Pro 560x, help! Ever since I bought my iMac, the GPU has always been at 0% usage. Till now, I thought it was a software bug since Macs aren't great with GPUs, but when I found out about Intel Power Gadget - which also said 0% - I became worried. I'm using an iMac 2019 21.5 inch with a Core i5, 8gb ram, and a Radeon Pro 560x, running on the latest. I've never had any real issues with graphics performance but fixing this might speed things up.\n\nActivity monitor says 0% usage across all programs, filtered by GPU top usage. Not sure what GPU time means, however.\n\nIPG says the same, with a requested graphics at 1.1ghz but with an actual GPU clock at 0.\nWhat should I do? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: It may well be a software bug that Activity Monitor and other tools don't report any GPU usage. Alternatively, exactly what GPU% is measuring may be not what we think. Obviously, the GPU is doing something. You may get additional information in Activity Monitor > Window > GPU History.\nMy 2014 MBP with an integrated graphics unit also reports 0% GPU on every process. I can just get WindowServer to report 5% by scrolling a window like mad for several seconds.\nFrom the spec, your 2019 has only the discrete Radeon GPU (since it doesn't need to fall back to a lower-power integrated unit like a laptop). So it has to be using the GPU if you're seeing stuff on the screen.\nIf you're not seeing any actual problems with the display, or performance issues with 'heavy' graphics tasks, then I'd say there's nothing to worry about.\nBear in mind that a lot of common tasks are actually trivial for modern hardware these days.\n\"Looking at data on what the OS is doing always leads to worry about whether it's the right numbers.\" ;-)\n\nA: It's not an issue.\nYou're not seeing any GPU usage because you're not using any GPU.  Rendering static pages doesn't require any significant resources.  Once it does render it, since it's technically not doing anything, there's no more reason for the GPU to be utilized.\nUsing a GPU Benchmark tool, Unigene's Heaven, I ran a process that specifically calls the GPU. This is continually rendering a high resolution animation.  As you can see from Activity monitor, the GPU is being utilized.\n\nYou can also do this with a simple video; localally via QuickTime, VLC, or Elmedia and even through a web browser like a YouTube video.  Below is Activity Monitor with a YouTube video playing in a Firefox tab and again we can see GPU utilization\n\n", "Q: Keeping iCloud from erasing my Mac data I've saved several files and photos onto my MacBook.

I don't think I've ever synced my MacBook with iCloud.\nI'd like to save things onto my Mac (or external hard drives) permanently, with iCloud as a tertiary backup for my phone.

How do I avoid losing my non-iCloud files while also syncing the iCloud files?\n\nA: Enabling iCloud does not remove everything on the MacBook, and then transfer over the iCloud synced files to the MacBook. That's not how it works, so you don't have to be afraid of that.\nIf you want to ensure that files are always stored on your Mac, and not only in iCloud, then you want to ensure that the \"Optimise Mac Storage\" setting is not enabled. Open System Preferences > Apple ID and ensure that there's no checkmark besides \"Optimise Mac Storage\".\nIf you do have a checkmark there, files stored in the iCloud Drive could potentially be removed from your Mac in case available disk space runs low. They will be refetched from iCloud when needed.\nSimilarly for photos and videos synced to iCloud using the Photos app, you'll want to ensure \"Optimise Mac Storage\" is turned off. Open up Photos.app and open Preferences from the menu. In the iCloud tab, you'll want to ensure that \"Optimise Mac Storage\" is not selected - instead you'll want to choose \"Download Originals to this Mac\". This ensures that every photo and video store in iCloud is also stored on your Mac.\n", "Q: LCD model number or disabling discrete GPU for MacBook Pro 15 Retina 2012-2013 While trying to replace the battery, I must have damaged certain connection to the discrete gpu. Whenever trying to use discrete gpu, the computer would freeze.\nAfter trying to reset VRAM, it basically won't boot anymore. (There's a 5% chance of booting by juggling around reset VRAM and unplugging boards.)\nI would love to fix it if possible, probably by permanently disabling the discrete gpu in some way, but not giving too much hope.\nRather I will probably just reuse my screen as external display.\n\nSo, do anyone know what's the lcd model number for it so I can get a controller board for it?\nThank you!\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot get the LCD panel model number from the command line as it's not stored in firmware as part of the monitor's EDID.\nFor example, I had to replace the the LCD of my 27\" iMac due to an unfortunate incident involving a disobedient child and a fidget spinner.

I'm being driven crazy by not being able to open one file from thousands. I'm using MacOS Catalina 10.15.6 & Excel for Mac 16.4.\nWhen upgrading from Office 2011 every time I opened a .xls file I saved as .xlsx. Over the past three months I've saved thousands of files like this. Today, one refused to open. Dialogue boxes when attempting to open queried validity or extension name. The file was created in Excel six weeks ago and has been opened since with no problems. I opened similar, created at same time, both before and after attempting to open this one with no problem.\nThen there's a message saying it may be read-only or encrypted. It's neither. I have permission to read and write (it's my own fil after all) and it hasn't been encrypted\nI make a copy to see if that helps. Dialogue box says again it may be corrupted or read only and then laughably it might be on a server that isn't responding.\nI've done everything I can think of. Zipped the file and tried to open unzipped. Changed file extension to .xls, changed application to open to first Numbers then OpenOffice. All without success.\nCrazily, Excel's 'quick look' function works and I can see the file with all tabs and all data intact but can't do anything else from this option like a save as or export.\nThe get info box says the file was most recently opened today when of course it didn't open.

The suggestions provided are not out of belief they will work, but because Excel has no other ideas.\nIf you can view it with Quick Look, this is because it's not fully corrupted. Quick Look is not powered by Excel, it's provided by default in macOS and must be operating in a different fashion.\nApplications like Preview or Numbers may be able to open the spreadsheet.

I have an LG HDTV and a 2019 MacBook Pro with a thunderbolt to HDMI adapter. What i would like to do is to watch tv normally but playing the tv's sound on the Mac's speakers. Is this possible? Does someone knows a way of doing this?\nThank you very much in advance\n\nA: No.  This cannot be done.\nYour MacBook doesn't have HDMI ports; they are Thunderbolt 3 ports meaning the display signal you're getting from it is DisplayPort.  So, they will not support ARC* (HDMI technology) as mentioned in the comments.  Secondly, the DisplayPort signal is one way; it's video out.\nThe Mac isn't designed to be an monitor with audio/video capabilities; it's not an HDMI endpoint device, it's the source.  This would be like asking your TV to send audio or video to your XBox or DVD player.\nNow, this doesn't mean you can't input sound into your Mac; obviously it can because it has a line input port.  What you need to do is extract the audio channel from the HDMI with an HDMI Audio De-Embedder/Extractor then take the audio via a 3.5mm cable and input it into the Mac. You can then use a product like Audio Hijack or Soundflower to route the audio from the Line-In to the speakers.\nWhile this is obviously possible, sending this into a computer will inherently introduce a audio delay as it has to be processed by the Mac.  Remember, your Mac isn't an amplifier where the audio is simply boosted, it's being processed.  Even a 1/4 second delay will be very noticeable and quite distracting.  Since you can't introduce a video delay on your LG, there will be no way to overcome this.\nBottom line...\nBuy a cheap set of speakers or a soundbar for the TV.  A lot of the Bluetooth speakers have a AUX input and the LG TVs have a 3.5mm output.  If not, you can always get the HDMI audio extractor.\n\n* Audio Return Channel. Wikipedia:  HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel.\n\nA: Disregard using HDMI.\nYour TV likely has a 3.5mm audio output jack.\nYour MacBook has audio input capability, either through the 3.5mm headphone jack or via a USB-C and/or Thunderbolt dongle.\nPlug the TV's 3.5mm audio output into your MacBook, and then play that audio on the MacBook's speakers:\n\n*\n\n*How can I play the sound from the audio in through my speakers?\n\n*Is there a way to listen to the input sound on Mac OS X?\n\nThere may be issues due to audio delay, but you should test that on your setup to see if it is satisfactory.\n", "Q: Way to copy-paste through airdrop with other people Is there any way to copy/paste from one device to another where the two devices are not logged in to the same iCloud account?\nEssentially, I'm looking for a feature similar to the Continuity feature that lets me copy and paste from all of my own devices but for devices that are not logged in into the same iCloud account.\nWhen working together on a project with someone else side by side, it would be super helpful if there was a way to quickly share something, be it a paragraph of text, an image, or a slide in Keynote, without having to save it to a file and then Airdrop the file to the other person.  Anyone aware of a way to do this?\n\nA: Apple's Universal Clipboard only works with devices that are signed into the same account.  With AirDrop, it requires a piece of content - you can't just paste your clipboard into AirDrop. However, if you want to share things with other people, there are a few things you can do:\n\n*\n\n*Shared Notebook like Notes or OneNote (I personally use OneNote).  Each person can have access to the same notebook and changes are instantaneous.\n\n\n*Send links and documents via Messaging.  iMessage, Skype, etc. all have the ability to share links, documents, etc.\n\n\n* Built in \"Share\" feature.   For example, on Firefox (Safari and Chrome as well), you can share a webpage via the services you have configured in System Preferences → Extensions → Share Menu.  AirDrop is one of these item and as long as the other person has a compatible device, you can share your content via AirDrop.\n\n\n\n*Native sharing in Apps like Word, Excel, Pages, etc.  All of these Apps have supported sharing/collaboration natively for a long time.    Instead of one person having the file and opening, extracting the data you want, then creating a new file, instead, share the file in a common location where everyone has access.\n\n\n*Look at paid apps.  There are tools like Microsoft Sharepoint, Microsoft Teams, Slack.\nMost of the paid applications (especially Sharepoint) will be overkill, but smaller products like Teams and Slack may be your next step as you grow.  The other items are free to use and with some creative IT structuring you can share things whether you're next to each other or halfway around the world apart.\nMy personal go-to is OneNote.  I share both entire notebooks and individual sections and/or pages. I share almost anything via those notebooks like links, documents, images, lists, web pages, etc.  And because it integrates with Microsoft To-Do that also integrates/syncs with Reminders, Outlook, Exchange, Calendar, etc. I have a simple platform for collaborating with others on my team.  I can assign and (accept assignment of) To-Dos for others right in the App, have the due dates pop up in both Reminders and Outlook and in the \"notes\" section of the To-Do, I can link a OneNote page with the content I need shared.\nThe best part - all of that is free.  With a little creativity, you can get a pretty good solution for what you're looking for.\n", "Q: Disable the physical Silent Mode switch on iPhone SE 2020?

When I connect my Magic Mouse 2 to the wall socket through a lighting cable, there is no indicator to show that it is charging. It has been some time and I don't see it working yet. Is there a way to know that it is charging indeed?\n(It could be an issue with the lightning cable as well, but I have no other device to test it with)\n\nA: Unlike the first generation Magic Mouse, there is no indicator present on the Magic Mouse 2 that would indicate the charging status.\nBut if you have access to a Mac (which is with which you are most likely using your Magic Mouse), you can use it to check if your Magic Mouse is charging.\nStart by pairing your Magic Mouse to your Mac and checking the battery status in either one of the following places:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Bluetooth icon towards the right of the macOS Menu Bar. Hover the mouse pointer over the entry corresponding to the Magic Mouse and see the current battery charge level.\n\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Mouse and look for the current battery charge level at the bottom of the window.\n\nNow charge your Magic Mouse 2 for a little while which you can do either using a wall outlet or Mac. Disconnect and check the charge status again to confirm if the Magic Mouse is indeed charging.\nAlternatively, you can have the Mouse System Preference pane open and connect the Magic Mouse 2 using the Lightning cable, and the battery indicator would change to show that the Mouse is charging.\n\n", "Q: How do I set up automatic, incremental backup for my macOS Photos.app library? I have ~30,000 photos in my library, which takes up ~90 GB disk space. My MacBook has limited hard drive size, so I'm using an external hard drive for my Photos library. The library is synced to iCloud.\nThis means I have two full copies of my photo library - the external drive and iCloud. But I still don't feel perfectly secure. I have heard of people who have lost large parts of their photo collection when absentmindedly deleting photos from one iOS device to free up space, only to realize that iCloud syncs the deletions to all other devices.\nSo I would like a third backup location, so that I can be reasonably sure I'll have a good backup of my entire photo library in case of disaster or screw-up. I would of course want everything to be as automated as possible, so that my photos are backed up every day (or on any modification) without me having to do anything.\nThese are the options I have researched:\n\n*\n\n*Create two partitions on the external drive - one for the Photos library, one for a Time Machine backup of the same. This would allow me to revert modifications to the library. Cons: Having a Time Machine backup and a Photos library on the same drive is not recommended by Apple, so I would need yet another HDD.\n\n\n*Use a 3rd party online backup service to mirror the entire Photos library. This allows me to recover from any disaster happening to my iCloud and/or local library. Cons: The Photos library consists of not only image files, but also a SQLite database file, which in my case is about 450MB. Every time I modify my library in any way, the database file is modified, meaning that I need to upload (at least) 450MB to the backup service for every single thing I do. This seems like a huge waste of bandwidth, and the backup is hardly incremental.\n\n\n*Keep the actual Photos library on the internal HDD, while having the image files as \"referenced\" images, stored on the external HDD. This would save space on the internal drive. Cons: Would require me to organize the file structure myself. iCloud sync is also not possible for referenced images.\nAre there any better options for achieving a good automated, incremental backup for macOS Photos?\n\nA: Backblaze might be a good option to mirror your entire Photos library. A 450MB overhead for a 90GB library isn't much; you'll need the database to fully restore your Photos Library i.e. albums, non-destructive edits etc. If you really want to backup just the original unmodified versions of photos and don't mind losing the organization and edits, you could backup only the Originals folder within the Photos Library.photoslibrary bundle.\nAlso, which version of macOS do you use? If Big Sur or Catalina, Photos Takeout may help you. This app exports photos and videos from Mac Photos in year or album-wise folders, and works with Photos for Sierra and later, but the feature to export incrementally is only available in Big Sur and Catalina (I work for App Initio Limited, the app developer, but for technical guidance you can contact our support team through the app).\n", "Q: How to search for files based on ACL or group permissions There are double entries for the group 'everyone' under permissions.

Once again, the above it is just an example, I use SmartCard because this is what I had issue in searching today, but it can be anything else.\n\nA: apropos just looks in the command description, not the full man page. There are no specific commands to \"intelligently\" search within all man pages, but in a bind you can always run\ncd /usr/share/man\nzgrep -i smartcard man*/*\n\nPS: This won't help for system_profiler though because the data types supported aren't listed in the man page at all.\n\nA: \nHow can I make a better search for a specific command line tool? I guess a search that will query the command line options too?\n\nThe problem with this type of question is qualifying what constitutes “a better search.”  It could be accuracy or frequency.  Put another way, it would  be somewhere on the line that balances quantity and quality of results.\nThat said, there’s only so much you’re going to get from the serarch.  From the apropos man page:\nSearch the whatis database for strings.\nThe whatis database is nothing more than a database of short descriptions of system commands.  It’s not a large, complex, rational database filled with metadata for each command;  it is what it is.\nUsing your example of “smart card,” you’re getting the results that you are because those are the commands where “smart card” shows up in the command descriptions database.\nSo, to get better results, you would want to be flexible with your keywords and use synonyms for the terms you’re searching for.  That said....\nYou can output the contents of the whatis database with this command\nwhatis ' ' | egrep '\\(1\\)'|sort\n\nThat’s it.

Recently I've got an aux jack stuck in the headphone port of my Macbook Pro 2015. (see photo below)\n\nThe entire jack broke off, as opposed to just the tip which is usually what happens for most. The jack is really wedged in as far as it will go and it's also at an angle.\nI've tried using a bit of super glue and sticking the end of the jack back on to the old cable and then pulling it, but that didn't work and I think there might even be some super glue in the port now.\nIve tried using pliars to get it out, but that doesn't work because there is hardly anything for it to grip on to.\nWould anyone know how to deal with this please? Any advice would be really appreciated!\nThanks,\nSam\n\nA: If the port has super glue in it, there isn’t anything you can do to remove the broken piece other than take it in for service and have the port replaced.\nThe audio jack is somewhat hollow, but it does have a conductor in the center.  It may have been possible to push a “tinned” piece of wire into the jack and then heat The wire so the solder will weld the wire to the jack allowing you to pull it out.  You’ll need a soldering iron and some soldering skills to do this.\nAlternately, you may be able to open the Mac, and from the back of the socket, use a stiff piece of wire to push it out of the jack.\nHowever, most likely, the only solution would be unsolder the jack from the logic board and solder on a new one. You’ll have to take in in unless you have surface mount PCB rework skills and tools.    Now, that’s going to be expensive, so if you opt to not do this and go for a workaround, you”ll either need to use Bluetooth speakers or a USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter) to give you back physical input and output connections.\n\nA: I just opened my MacBook Air M1 2020...

I've been having troubles with my external HDD and have been looking so hard for a solution.\nI've tried everything. Diskutil, FSCK, testdisk. But only to find what I already know... \"Invalid B-tree node size\". It's unbelievable that Apple hasn't included a fixer for this kind of problem within its tools like diskutil.\nMy concern is, what is the meaning of this error?\nIs there any solution to this problem without using a expensive 3rd party software?\nIsn't there any open source software to recover my data?\nHas anyone fixed this problem before?\nI certainly would love just to buy a specialized software like DiskWarrior, but I can't afford that price.\n\nA: It basically means the file can't be looked in the B-Tree. A more in-depth explanation can be found at https://www.easeus.com/mac-file-recovery/invalid-b-tree-node-size.html\nOption 1 - Disk Utility\nIt's an inbuilt disk repair utility that repairs most commonly seen hard drive problems.\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu, click Restart.\n\n*Press and hold the Command and R keys until the Apple logo appears and then release the keys.\n\n*Click Disk Utility and click Continue.\n\n*In the sidebar, select the disk with invalid b-tree node size and you want to repair, click the First Aid button.\n\n*Click Run.\n\nIf Disk Utility can't repair your disk, run it again. Or else, move on the next solutions.\nOption 2 - Fsck command\nThe fsck command is used to repair disk and file system problems on your Mac.\n\n*\n\n*Start your Mac in single-user mode. Restart it, and then press and hold the Command+S keys while it boots.\n\n*Type the command /sbin/fsck -fy into the terminal and press Enter to start a file system check.\n\n*When the fsck command has your disk checked and repaired, type reboot and press Enter. Your Mac will reboot and return to the usual login screen.\n\nOption 3 - Reformat\nTake the Mac hard drive reformatting as the last step, because this formatting process will erase all data on the drive completely. Make sure you've backed up your hard drive with Time Machine.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility. Click the icon for your external hard drive in the sidebar on the left.\n\n*Click the Erase tab along the top of the window.\n\n*From the Volume Format menu, choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n*Enter a name for the external hard drive in the Name field.\n\n*Click the Erase button.\n\nDisclaimer This answer is originally from https://www.easeus.com/mac-file-recovery/invalid-b-tree-node-size.html and was helpful for me when i had the same issue.\n\nA: Whenever you save a file on Mac, the Mac operating system creates a unique entry for the file on the index table with B-tree format. So each time you access a file, the Mac operating system navigates this tree to locate the file. Once B-tree is corrupted, the Mac operating system fails to and you will see the error message: \"Invalid B-tree node size. This disk needs to be repaired\".\nRead more from this post: https://iboysoft.com/mac-data-recovery/invalid-b-tree-node-size.html\nI'm afraid that you can only reformat your disk to fix this error. But this operation will erase all data on the hard drive completely. If you have important data, you should use data recovery software to restore them before reformatting.\n\nA: Is there any solution to this problem without using an expensive 3rd party software? Has anyone fixed this problem before?\nThe usual solution to disk problems is to maintain a backup of your files, so that when things go wrong, you have another copy of your files. Apple has included a 'fixer': Time Machine, which is an excellent and effortless backup utility.\nThe alternative is data recovery software, and yes you'll need to buy that. Data Rescue 6 offers recovery from as little as $19, and you can see what it will recovery before buying.\nhttps://www.prosofteng.com\n", "Q: What's the difference between Export as PDF and Print, Save as PDF in Apple Pages? This question has been asked in regard to Safari, and some six years ago, so i would like to reiterate this with a focus on Pages.\nI am trying to understand how it works. If i run File -> Export to -> PDF from Pages and i do a Print -> Save as PDF i get results that to the naked eye show no difference. Filesizes differ though: 97.7 MB and 97.8 MB.\nThe document i work on has 296 pages, contains hundreds of graphics and pictograms and many hundred line elements, as well as multiple fonts.\nCan someone enlighten me in regard to how these two print/export functions work and what the differences are? Because even if i change settings in the Print dialogue before hitting Save to PDF i still get the same result as if i don't make any changes.\n\nA: In short: Not much. The only significant difference between the two is the different options that are displayed in the dialogs in each process.\nExport PDF gives you image compression, the ability to include various metadata.\n\n\"Save As PDF\" gives you options to set keywords such as Title, Author, and lets you set Security options.\n\nThere may conceivably be slight differences in the way that the PDF is formulated - it's likely that using \"Save As PDF\" from the print menu will involve the print driver for the selected printer in some way. (Though, for example, note that a mono printer still produces colour PDFs.)\nIt's all just a conversion from CoreGraphics (which is conceptually similar) to PDF. Apple's PDF-creating routines don't have the latitude and range of options that you find in GhostScript or Distiller.\nComparing two PDFs created by each of the two methods reveals that the data is substantially the same for the vast majority: the differences lie in things like decimal precision of page sizes (again, likely due to page definitions in the print driver).\n", "Q: What language is used in equations in Pages and Keynote? e.g. \\texttt{}, \\mathtt{}, \\tt{} and \\text{} This answer to How to include equations in-line with text within the cell of a table in Keynote? is quite helpful. I noticed that \\text{} is interpreted as boldface, and I had to find something else to get \"normal\" looking text within an equation, whereas in MathJax that we use here in Stack Exchange \\text{} produces \"normal\" text within an equation.\nIt seems that \\mathtt{} and \\tt{} produce \"normal\" looking text while \\texttt{} and \\text{}produce boldface font.\nQuestion: When we start a recent version of Keynote or Pages, exactly what language is used to generate equations? Is it MathJax or Tex or LaTex or MathML or some mix? Is there a documentation page where I can find reliable information on how to format complicated equations with various features like matrices, aligned equal signs for several equations appearing in multiple lines, and other goodies?\nSecondary question: Are there options for changing which language is used, or is it hard-coded?\nRight now I only know Mathematics SE Meta's MathJax basic tutorial and quick reference and so far I've simply been lucky that most of what I do in MathJax seems to work in Notes and Pages.\n\n\nA: Pages supports equations written with both LaTeX commands and MathML elements. However, it doesn't support all of each language providing only a subset of available features.\nIn regards MathJax, it is actually also the case that MathJax supports LaTeX and MathML markup, so that's why you'll find that commands used with MathJax also work with Pages. The environments, configurations, installed packages, and so on, are not the same however, and that's why you'll find inconsistencies in how the same lines of code are displayed in the two systems.\nYou'll find Apple's documentation for the feature here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202501\nThere are no options to change which languages are supported by equations in Pages.\n", "Q: Looking for iOS virtual environment to run on Windows 10 We are a team working from home and can't share iPad in the office due to pandemic.. We are looking for a virtual environment of iOS (iPad) to run on Windows 10 when it's time to troubleshoot iOS related questions. I am not sure this even exists for copyright and so on but I thought asking here might get me somewhere. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Unfortunately a legal iOS virtual environment on Windows 10 does not exist. Apple forbids, via their End User Licence Agreements (EULAs), running Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware.\nThe only legal iOS simulator available is included with Xcode and Xcode requires macOS.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina Preview.app cannot create signature with built-in camera I'm on macOS Catalina 10.15.6 19G2021 x86_64.\nI was trying to create a signature with Preview.app and the MacBook's built-in camera, when I clicked on Done button, the captured signature wasn't saved.\nI tried to restart Preview.app, reopen the document and open another document and it still didn't work.\nIs it a bug? What should I do? Thanks!\n\nPreview.app version from \"About Preview\":\n\n\nA: You have to hold your signature ON the blue line, like that was a line on a page where you are signing.\nThe camera's view of your paper is mirror image. However, once Preview detects your signature, it will digitise it and display it correctly (non-mirror), and in a way that looks like you'd actually signed the screen (i.e. it's not just a picture of your paper).\nIn the image below you can see the digitised image in black, with my paper, with blue ink, somewhat obscured in the background:\n\n", "Q: Is the MacBook Pro's internal microphone really stereo? My MacBook Pro's (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) internal microphone identifies as a stereo microphone (in the System Report as well as in Audio MIDI Setup),\nHowever if I record some audio with it to a stereo channel in Logic, I get two completely identical channels. I verified by putting Logic's Gain effect, inverting the phase of one of the channels and summing them to mono, which results in complete silence -\n\nIs the microphone indeed just mono? Why does it work as a fake stereo microphone? Is that so that if I connect a stereo mic to the line-in it will work as the same device?\n\nA: Looking at the technical specifications of some random MacBook Pro computers, none say that there’s a “stereo microphone”. Instead, they reference “dual microphones” “or a “3 mic array”.  Personally, what I have found is that these microphones are not up to the task of anything beyond a quick voice recording, dictation, or the occasional FaceTime/Skype video chat session.  Even then, I’ve found it necessary to use a proper external microphone.  My feeling is that it’s not really a stereo mic, but mono microphones that are digitally made stereo.\nMany years back I was tasked with coming up with a way to record a live presentation as it was streamed from a camera attached to a MacBook.  They were using the internal mic to pick up the sounds.  The loud speakers were in non-eqiadistant locations to the Mac so I was concerned with the how the sound would come out since one speaker was obviously closer to the Mac than the other.  Well, the sound was bad but it wasn’t stereo - both channels were identically bad.  What I found that in order to get a proper, quality stereo recording, I needed to utilize a mixer and obtain the audio directly from audio gear as opposed to letting the internal microphone do the work.\nBottom line, I would avoid using the internal mic if you can - it’s more for convenience than quality.  Use a USB mic or if using more professional gear, a USB mixer so you can manage and manipulate the sound levels properly.\n", "Q: How to create a bootable OS X Snow Leopard USB drive? How can I achieve this from either macOS Catalina or Windows 10? I can't seem to find a guide online. I've downloaded Mac OS X Snow Leopard Install DVD from the Internet Archive. Keep in mind that this is an .iso file, not .dmg.\nI don't need a full step-by-step guide, just need to know how to format the drive (MBR/GPT?) and how to copy the .iso file to it.\n\nA: Creating a USB Flash Drive Installer from a Snow Leopard ISO File\nBelow are three methods. The first method, which involves the Disk Utility application, failed to work when tested using macOS Catalina 10.15.7 on an iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5. User John Mark Harrell's answer confirms this is also true when using Big Sur on an unspecified Mac. So the OP should probably try the second method involving the use of the dd command or the third method involving Balena Etcher.\nUsing the Disk Utility Applicaton\nThis was tested using an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 with MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 installed. The flash drive needs to be at least 8 GB in size. The Snow Leopard ISO file was the same as discussed in this answer, which should be the same ISO you have linked to in your question.\n\n*\n\n*Use the Finder application to mount the Snow Leopard ISO file.\n\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase the flash drive, as shown below. I chose the default name Untitled. Finally, click on the Erase button.\n\n\n\n*Highlight the name Untitled, then click on the Restore button on the top of the Disk Utility application window. In the popup window, select restore from Mac OS X Install DVD, as shown below. Finally, click on the Restore button in the popup window.\n\nUsing the Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\nNote: This flashdrive will be using the Apple Partition Map scheme. This differs from the flash drive created using the Disk Utility, which used the Master Boot Record scheme. In other words, there is more than one way to create a USB flash drive installer from a Snow Leopard ISO file.\n\nThe steps below are for OS X and macOS.\n\n*\n\n*Use the command given below to determine the identifier for the flash drive.\ndiskutil list\n\n\n\n*Enter the commands given below to create the USB flash drive installer. Here, an assumption is made that the ISO file name is snow leopard install.iso and the file resides in your Downloads folder. Also, an assumption is made that the identifier is disk2. If necessary, make the appropriate substitutions.\nDISK=disk2\ndiskutil unmountdisk $DISK\nsudo dd if=\"$HOME/Downloads/snow leopard install.iso\" of=/dev/r$DISK bs=1m\n\nThe steps below are for Linux.\n\n*\n\n*Use the command given below to determine the name for the flash drive.\nlsblk\n\n\n\n*Enter the command given below to determine if any volumes on the flash drive are mounted. If there are mounted volumes, then use the sudo unmount command to unmount them before proceeding. Here, an assumption is made that the name for the flash drive is sdb. If necessary, make the appropriate substitutions in the rest of the steps.\nmount | grep /dev/sdb\n\n\n\n*Enter the command given below to create the USB flash drive installer. Here, an assumption is made that the ISO file name is snow leopard install.iso and the file resides in your Downloads folder. If necessary, make the appropriate substitutions.\nsudo dd if=\"$HOME/Downloads/snow leopard install.iso\" of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\n\nUsing Windows 10\n\nNote: Any version of Windows compatible with Balena Etcher should make an appropriate substitution for Windows 10. User John Mark Harrell has also posted an answer verifying macOS Big Sur can be substituted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Balena Etcher to Windows. This answer was testing using the portable version, which can be executed without having to be installed. The file downloaded was balenaEtcher-Portable-1.7.3.exe.\n\n\n*Use Etcher to flash the image stored in the ISO file to the USB flash drive. When testing the following pop-up appeared.\n\nThe image does contain an Apple partition table, which is not recognized by Etcher. Since this check for a partition table is not required, the message can be ignored. Select the Continue button.\n\nA: I couldn't find a method that worked as Disk Utility doesn't cooperate with OS 10.6 .dmg or .iso files, the instructions above might work on older versions of macOS, but I couldn't get it to work on Big Sur. But then I discovered that the same method I've been using to create bootable linux thumb drives works with the 10.6 .iso AND .dmg (depending on which one you have), and it's way easier and works on any operating system (mac/windows/linux).\n\n*\n\n*download balenaEtcher - https://www.balena.io/etcher/\n\n*Install and run, choose your .iso/.dmg file. A warning will pop up about how it's missing a partition table (the same reason DiskUtility refuses to flash it), but you can simply click continue. Then select your USB drive and flash.\n\n*Wait for the process to finish and you're done, super easy. I had no issues booting into the installer on my old 2008 MacBook (for those who don't know how, just plug in your USB stick and restart your Mac while holding the option key).\n\nBe sure to use a standard installation DVD .dmg or .iso, some of these are copied from the \"grey\" disk, which means they're attached to a specific machine and won't allow you to install even though you can still boot into it successfully.\n\nA: As another user noted, the Balena Etcher method works great on a Mac. On my 2021 MacBook Pro (with M1 Pro chip), I created a bootable OS X Snow Leopard USB drive using a .DMG of Snow Leopard I downloaded on the internet. And then installed Snow Leopard on a 2009 MacBook Pro without a hiccup.\n", "Q: Do we still need to terminate the display port with Catalina? Thank you for the hint about getting better resolution options by holding down the Option key in the Display Prefs on the Mac Mini.\nThe hard drive on our network-only Mac died and it lost all of its settings and I couldn't get it back to nearly as large as it used to be.  I also went ahead and upgraded from Sierra to Catalina in the process.  We only use it for QuickBooks, which allows our CPA and Bookkeeper and my wife and I to log in remotely and we were lost when that HD failed.\nMy only remaining question is whether we still need to terminate the display port with Catalina, or perhaps they snuck a firmware update in there where the cursor doesn't slow down to a crawl? I bought a couple of those from OWC after failing to create my own and still have one plugged in.  Does it still need it?  I haven't had time to extensively test, but just thought I'd ask since I didn't notice a huge difference with it out.\nThanks again for the sharp minds here (Everett) who knew about this option trick. Saved me tons of eyestrain and annoyance!\n\nA: You should not need to terminate the video port of your Mac mini as support for a headless machine is natively supported by macOS - Remote into Mac Mini after a reboot.  I say “should” because while it is supposed to be supported, I’ve run into instances where it would simply fail without it - notably VNC.\nBottom line is that you shouldn’t need it.  But, does it hurt to have it?  No.  It’s also sufficiently inexpensive that getting one so you don’t have to worry about any issues makes it quite feasible.\n", "Q: Get Value of Variable stops appending on last call & sets result to only that last variable I have created a simple workflow in Automator to ask questions & send an email. I followed the tutorial at https://macmost.com/create-customizable-text-inserts-using-automator.html. This has worked for me in different usages, but in this workflow, I have an issue. Near the end of the workflow, multiple variables are retrieved using \"Get Value of Variable\" to create a message consisting of them all. As each variable is retrieved, it is added to the last variables. However, the last get value of the variable I use deletes all of the other variables which were previously shown in \"results\" and the result becomes only that variable.\nI have attached an image for reference. As you can see it continues to increase (4 items, 5 items), but when the last variable is got, it deletes all of the other items & is set to 1 item.\nI have tried deleting the ask for text/set variable for the last statement, and it results in the issue occurring on the \"new\" get value of variable.\n\n\nA: Running your workflow unedited...\nIn the fifth Get Value of Variable action, when running the original workflow, its Results, with the list button selected, was, e.g.,:\n(\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"Hey\") ]>\",\n  \"What's Up?\",\n  \"1-3\",\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"Full QA\") ]>\",\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"aren't\") ]>\"\n)\n\nIn the sixth Get Value of Variable action, when running the original workflow, its Results, with the list button selected, was, e.g.,:\n(\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"Thank you\") ]>\"\n)\n\nWhen it would have beed expected to be, e.g.,:\n(\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"Hey\") ]>\",\n  \"What's Up?\",\n  \"1-3\",\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"Full QA\") ]>\",\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"aren't\") ]>\"\n  \"<NSAppleEventDescriptor: [ 'utxt'(\"Thank you\") ]>\"\n)\n\nJust to test something out, I converted all the Ask for Text actions to Run AppleScript actions that did the same thing, and initially converted all but the last Run JavaScript actions to Run AppleScript action and everything worked.\nI then converted the last remaining Run JavaScript action to Run AppleScript action and everything worked. I did this because of the differences in how each variable was being saved/returned. Thus by making all the variables the same type/class it worked.\nIn the fifth Get Value of Variable action, when running the edited workflow, its Results, with the list button selected, was, e.g.,:\n{\"Hey\", \"What's Up?\", \"1-3\", \"Full QA\", \"aren't\"}\n\nIn the sixth Get Value of Variable action, when running the edited workflow, its Results, with the list button selected, was, e.g.,:\n{\"Hey\", \"What's Up?\", \"1-3\", \"Full QA\", \"aren't\", \"Thank you\"}\n\nAs you can see in the example results what's returned is a plain list of text strings not mixed as in the output of the original workflow.\nThe end result was, e.g.,:\n\nWhile I can not say for sure, nonetheless, it looks like there may be some sort of bug with the type/class count when stacking more than five Get Value of Variable actions and why it does not fail when all have been acquired, set and retrieved when done using the same type of actions.\n\nHere is a link for the edited workflow: Send_QA_Mail_Test.zip\n\n*\n\n*SHA1: dfdec5414d0d5e22c46ad444b7bb77f19b442a45\n\nA: I had encountered same problem when some \"Get Value of Variable\"s were set after \"Run AppleScript\".\n\nAfter all, I adopt workaround that is set \"Run Shell Script\" imedeatelly after \"Run AppleScript\".\nIn \"Run Shell Script\" just execute \"cat\".\n\n", "Q: How to scale the graphics for Mac OS I recently purchased this 2k monitor on Amazon. I'm connecting my 2015 Macbook Pro 15 inch w/ retina display using a DisplayPort Mini to DisplayPort cable. I'm currently running Mac OS Mojave. These are the resolutions I can use apaprently:\n\n1440p looks really nice, but everything is so tiny. I can zoom in on some apps, but not all of them; system fonts can't be changed at all.\n1080p is a more comfortable scale but then things start to look blurry.\nIs there no way to reach a happy medium? Do I just need to pick whether to sacrifice readability or aesthetic? I feel like Windows and linux have a way of setting the scale of things independent of the resolution, does such a thing exist for Mac?\nUPDATE: I tried out TinkerTool and it only scales some things, not all of them. For example, the menu bar at the top of the screen remains the same size. Also graphical things like the traffic light buttons are unaffected. So overall it didn't really help\nUPDATE 2: When I use my laptop by itself I see something like this:\n\nAll the options look great on the Mac screen, but the options for the monitor aren't as nice looking...\n\nA: I would download SwitchResX and try the various settings to see if you can find one you like:\nhttps://www.madrau.com/srx_download/download.html\nThe optimal use for that kind of monitor is the native 2560x1440, however you write that it's too tiny for you. It would probably have been better to get a larger monitor at the same resolution (i.e. a 27\" or similar for example).\nWith the current monitor I would try setting it a resolution that is an integer fraction of the native resolution. I.e. for example try setting it to 1280x720. You can also try 1280x720 HiDPI mode, which should look alright.\n\nA: If you hold down Option when you click on the 'Scaled' radio button, you should see a greater list of resolution options.\nThis will include 1280 x 720 (HiDPI), which is a 'Retina' scaling of your monitor's pixels: (i.e. just as much detail as 1440p, but everything twice the size.)\nBear in mind that other resolution sizes apart from 1440p or 720 HiDPI will require more effort, as the Mac will have to calculate fractional pixels and use more anti-aliasing.\n"]
