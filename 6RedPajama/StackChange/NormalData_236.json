["Q: Changing Screen Brightness Through Keyboard Functions on My Notebook I've installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my Asus X555LJ.\nBut I don't know how to install drivers or how to enable function keys to controls screen backlight brightness.\n\nA: It seems quite common for brightness Fn keys to not work on Asus machines. On my Asus X205TA the brightness function keys don't work natively but I can use xbacklight as a workaround:\nsudo apt install xbacklight\n\ncommands:\nget current brightness:\nxbacklight -get \n\nset brightness to 50%\nxbacklight -set 50\n\nincrease brightness by 10%\nxbacklight -inc 10\n\ndecrease by 10%\nxbacklight -dec 10\n\nIf these work, you can get the function keys to change brightness by assigning them as shortcuts to the commands.\nIn keyboard settings click Custom Shortcuts and click the + button to add a new one\n\nName: Brighter\nCommand: xbacklight -inc 15\nClick OK, then click where it says 'Disabled' next to the new shortcut and press the key combination you want (Fn will probably not work) for example ctrl+F6 or just F6\nName: Dimmer\nCommand: xbacklight -dec 15\nAnd make this one F5 or whatever combination you want.\n\nA: I am on 20.04 and I used dconf-editor to adjust the screen brightness from keyboard shortcuts.\nOpen dconf-editor and search for screen-brightness-up and screen-brightness-down, and under custom-value change the value to the shortcut you want to set (will tell later how to know what to enter).\n\nI don't know the exact syntax followed by dconf-editor, but I will tell you how to find the syntax. Head over to settings > Keyboard shortcuts. Now search for volume up, and choose the shortcut which you want to use for screen brightness up. Then head over to dconf editor and search for volume-up, and now see the string in the custom value for volume-up, and now copy paste this string to the screen-brightness-up > custom value field. We have to do this as we can access the shortcuts for volume and not for brightness.\nSo we manipulate the value for volume from settings and then use that value for screen-brightness-up in the dconf editor. And then remove that custom value from dconf-edtor for volume-up (or set it back to its previous value).\nHope this helps. I was finding this for a very long time and the other answer didn't work for me, but I was finally able to figure this hack out, and hopes this helps many other people.\nyoutube.com/watch?v=rZl2PJ8Vt1w.

I am trying to uninstall Ubuntu from a dual- boot system with Windows 7. According to the Howtogeek tutorial on this, I need to delete the Ubuntu partitions from the computer. When I side- click them and click \"Delete Volume\", it gives me a warning box about how the disk has information that may be interpreted by other operating systems and asks if I want to delete the partition. When I click yes, an error box titled \"Virtual Disk Manager\" with a message saying \"Access is denied.\" appears. According to a few forums on how to solve similar problems with partitions and this error, to solve this, I need to side- click the partition, click \"Properties\" and change the security settings, but I am not able to click on properties.\nScreenshots\n\nA: Did you unmount the drive? Check for that. If that isn't the problem, here's how I'd do it.\nIn windows there is a command line utility called diskpart. It allows you to manage drives.\nGo to your command prompt and type in diskpart and give it permission.\nType list disk and find the drive by its size.\nType select disk- whatever disk number it is.\nNow you can use clean to wipe the whole drive. If it gives you an error, go to detail disk and select volume and a volume number. Now you can use clean. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SELECTED THE CORRECT DRIVE!!!\nYou may want to create partition primary; assign letter with the letter you want the drive to be; and active. You should have successfully cleaned your hard drive. Comment with any issues you may have.\nIn Ubuntu, I use gparted. You can change permissions with chmod and maybe even delete them with a terminal with sudo. Sorry, not a linux expert yet, but that's what I'd do. :)\n", "Q: How to download on computer with no OS? If I buy or build a computer with no OS, how do I get Ubuntu?\nI am looking at building a PC with a tight budget and don't want to blow US$100 on WindowsÂ 10.\n\nA: You can buy a live USB here.\nAnother option is to download the .iso file on a friend's PC. You would then be able to burn that .iso file to a dvd, which would make it a live/installation DVD. There would also be the option to make a live USB instead using a program such as unetbootin (Mac, Linux or Windows), Rufus (Windows) or Startup Disk Creator (Ubuntu).\nIf you don't have access to another PC, it looks like buying the live USB from the Canonical store is your best bet. There are several places to buy live DVD/CD packages such as thelinuxshop.co.uk, but you can't necessarily guarantee that it's not been maliciously modified.\n\nA: You will need another computer to create a boot DVD or USB stick. \nDOWNLOADING\nFrom the PC you're using to create the disk or USB, go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop and click the download link.  Here you have an opportunity to donate to Ubuntu before downloading, or, click on \"Not now, take me to the download\" to just start downloading.  There's also alternative downloads such as through torrents here : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\nCREATE USB/DVD\nIf you have access to a Windows machine, I suggest you download the ISO you want, and a program called Rufus to make the image into a bootable USB, or create a DVD.  Creating a bootable USB is easy.  Run Rufus, leave all options as they are, but next to \"Create a bootable disk using\", change the drop down menu to ISO Image.  Then click on Browse, and find and select your ISO file that you downloaded earlier.\nYou can also create the boot USB with unetbootin on a Linux machine, but I find Rufus works much better.  If the computer you're using is a Linux machine, run unetbootin.  If it's not installed, install it with sudo apt-get install unetbootin.\nFrom the main screen of unetbootin, select the option button next to \"Diskimage\", make sure the dropdown menu says \"ISO\", and click the button with the 3 dots to find and select the ISO file you downloaded.  Now at the bottom, ensure you've selected the disk you want to make bootable and click \"Ok\".\nPURCHASING\nCanonical sells bootable sticks which you can buy from them directly here: http://shop.canonical.com/index.php?cPath=17\nINSTALLING \nNow, no matter which method you used to create the disk or bootable USB, put the media into the computer that has no OS.  Consult your computer's manual, or online documentation, to see if you need to make any changes in your BIOS in order to boot from a DVD or USB stick.  There should also be an option where you can press a key during bootup to select which device you would like to boot from.\nFrom here, once you've booted, it's very well guided.  When it comes to the installer asking where to install Ubuntu, select \"Use Entire Disk\", or \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\", whichever one is presented to you.  The rest of the installation is fairly straightforward and guided.\n", "Q: I accidentally tried to remove all files from the root path I was working on a folder with write permissions on terminal when I tried to clean the current directory and start over using \nsudo rm -r ./*\n\nBut it took some time to finish which made me wonder and that was when I saw that I'm not on the folder I was expecting and I'm actually on the root path, so I just hurriedly aborted using Ctrl+C.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is working now, So I'm assuming no real harm was done, right?\n\n*How can I know what was deleted meanwhile?\n\n*Is there a way to fix Ubuntu to compensate for what was lost?\n\n*Is there a way of somehow keeping this from happening again? say an extra prompt whenever I try to remove more than 100 files?\n\n\nA: Hopefully you have a LiveUSB or LiveCD to boot from.  In the event that you did end up deleting enough to crash your system, you can boot to a Live media and select \"Try Ubuntu\".\nThere are some option to \"undelete\" files with programs like extundelete, photorec, foremost and scalpel.  But some of these can become a nightmare to use, especially if you're not even sure what got deleted.\nAnother option that I recommend is to reinstall, and preserve your /home directory.\nOnce booted to your Live media, you now have the opportunity to make a backup of your /home folder, provided it wasn't already deleted.  If you /home folder was deleted, you may want to consider using one of the above mentioned software if you feel that the files were really important.\nOtherwise, go ahead and make a backup copy of your /home folder to another disk such as a USB stick, or another internal disk if you have one.\nUse rsync to do this like so rsync -avz /home /location/of/where/youre/backing\nNow in the Live session, there should be a shortcut on the launcher or the desktop called \"Install Ubuntu\".  If not, just reboot again to the Live media and select \"Install Ubuntu\".\nIn the installation portion, when you reach the partitioning page, click on \"Something Else\".  Here you will see your partitions.  Edit the one that had your Ubuntu installed to it, and set it as the same format as before (ext2/3 etc) and mount as root (/).  Ensure the checkbox to format is UNCHECKED!\nDo the same thing with your SWAP partition.  If you had a your /home folder or any other folders mounted on other partitions, make sure you also select those to be remounted how they were before.  Again, with the format option unchecked.\nContinue with the installation.  This installation will reinstall the entire OS, and will overwrite everything but it will NOT delete anything in your /home folder or anywhere else.  So all your files will still be there.  When you get to the last part of the installation to create a user, make sure you use the exact same username and same password.\nReboot and see if all your files and settings are there.  You may have to reinstall some programs, but you'll find that after you install the programs, all your settings will still be there.  Example is if you reinstall Chrome, your history, bookmarks etc will appear.\nIf you ARE missing files, boot back into the Live media, plug in or mount the drive where you made a backup of your home folder, mount your Ubuntu partition, and do rsync the other way around.\nrsync -avz /location/of/your/backup/home /location/of/your/mounted/ubuntu\nThis should restore everything.\n\nA: Stop using the computer so that you don't overwrite any deleted data on the hard drive, and shut it down. \nGet a LiveUSB, boot from it and install Testdisk. Use Testdisk to try and recover your partitions and files. Copy any important data to another flash drive, not the LiveUSB. Open the Ubuntu installer and install Ubuntu.\nI have personally used Testdisk and have had some luck with it. While it may work, it also may not. Please don't think of this as the cure-all for deleted files, because it isn't. Don't rely on it and think you're safe running rm no matter what, because the chance of full recovery is nowhere near 100%. With that said, if you haven't used the computer since running rm, you have a high chance of at least a partial recovery: enough to get your data.\nEven if you had let rm complete, you might not have even noticed any issues with Ubuntu right away. You would probably still be able to use any open programs. Trying to open anything would result in errors. Continuing to use Ubuntu when all your files have been deleted is a bad idea, however, as new data might overwrite the old, ruining your chances of recovery.\n\nA: It's highly unlikely that command went through on a modern Ubuntu without the following:\n$ rm -rf /\n/bin/rm: it is dangerous to operate recursively on '/'\n/bin/rm: use --no-preserve-root to override this failsafe\n\nrm would likely continue to remove everything in $HOME which you do have write access to, but the rest of / is probably preserved.\nThe other answers, however, are absolutely correct as well, and caution should be taken to preserve what you can.\n", "Q: OpenVPN in LXC: Failed to set devices.allow I have been trying to get OpenVPN working in a LXD-managed LXC container on Ubuntu 16.04.

There shouldn't be but a few things running. Again, I'd research each one to make sure its useful to my usage and needs.\n3 - I'd double check the settings in the Power Menu as well as the Brightness & Lock settings too. Could be a bad combination of settings.\n4 - I'd also check Bluetooth and wireless settings, if left on they could easily draw from battery. Again, could be a bad combination of settings.\n5 - Remember to save and exit from any apps you have running before suspending your laptop.\n6 - I'd, personally, try a new fresh install with a new download and a freshly burned CD.

Change them with the xrandr --setprovideroutputsource and --setprovideroffloadsink options.\nOther environment variables may allow control of the source/sink e.g.:\n __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia  \n\nI have noticed sometimes the CUDA samples on Ubuntu 22.04 don't run because the source/sink are reversed, and the above environment variables need to be set before the executable.\n", "Q: Why does my laptop's screen remain black when I try to unlock it?

I use my laptop with multiscreen: laptop screen on one side, my TV displaying my media center (Kodi) on the other side. Problem, when I use my media center to watch a movie, the laptop screen never switch to sleep mode.\nI'm looking for a command to sleep the laptop screen, but ONLY this screen, and go out of this mode by using the touchpad. I was thinking to use xrandr, but it seems I can only deactivate (with option --off) the screen, and not just sleep it.\nAny idea that would help?\n\nA: Toggle- dim a specific screen\nThe command to dim the screen (not switch off, but not \"sleep\" either) would be:\nxrandr --output $monitor --brightness 0\n\nYou can however easily toggle- dim the targeted screen with a keyboard shortcut. Add the script below to a shortcut:\n#!/bin/bash\n# --- set your monitor below\nmonitor=VGA-0\n# ---\nif [ -z \"$(xrandr --verbose | grep 'Brightness: 0.0')\" ]; then\n  xrandr --output $monitor --brightness 0\nelse\n  xrandr --output $monitor --brightness 1\nfi\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as dim_screen.sh, and make it executable\n\n*In the head of the script, set the name of your targeted screen. Run the command xrandr to find out if you don't know.\n\n*Add it to a shortut key: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\n\n\n    /path/to/dim_screen.sh\n\nExplanation\nThe test:\n[ -z \"$(xrandr --verbose | grep 'Brightness: 0.0')\" ]\n\nwill see if the command xrandr --verbose | grep 'Brightness: 0.0' has an output, in other words, if your screen is dimmed. If so, it will set the targeted screen to \"normal\" brightness (1.0):\nxrandr --output $monitor --brightness 1\n\n...else it will dim the screen with the command:\nxrandr --output $monitor --brightness 0\n\nNote\nIt seems impossible to only put a specific screen to sleep.

From this man sh:\n\nA pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by |. The standard output of each command but the last is connected by a pipe(2) to the standard input of the next command. Each command is run as a separate process; the shell waits for the last command to terminate. The value of a pipeline is the exit status of its last command.\n\nA | B | C\n\nWill take the standard output of A (what it prints to the screen) and give it to B as standard input, like what you would type in an interactive mode, and B gives its stdout to C.\nhistory | grep word\n\nhistory prints all of your shell's history, and grep prints lines matching a pattern, so this finds every entry in your shell history where you've used word, because grep reads STDIN when not given a filename as an argument.\nhistory | tail -n10 | head -n5 \n\nGets the first 5 lines of the last 10 lines of history, because tail and head both read STDIN when no filename is given.\n\nOn the other hand, || is the logical OR operator, exactly equivalent to the same operator in C and C-like languages. Again, from that man sh:\n\nThe symbols && and ||, respectively, cause the list following to be executed only if the preceding pipeline returns a zero or non zero value, respectively. Newlines may appear in a list, instead of semicolons, to delimit commands.\n\nstat filename || echo \"no such file or directory\" \nstat filename && echo \"file exists\"\n\nIf stat doesn't find the filename, it returns a nonzero exit status, and if it does, it exits successfully with 0. This is the inverse of C. (Highly contrived examples as stat gives such information anyways.)\nThese are essentially the same as, but shorter than, checking the last command's exit status explicitly:\nstat filename\nif [ $? -gt 0 ]; then\n  echo \"no such file or directory\"\nfi\n\netc.\n\nA: | is the pipe operator, which passes the output of the first command to the one that follows.\nfrom man bash:\n\nA  pipeline  is  a  sequence  of one or more commands separated by the character |.  The format for a pipeline is:\n[time [-p]] [ ! ] command [ | command2 ... ]\n\nThe standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.\n\nIn the example you provide, id doesn't seem to do anything with the output of ls so it just returns the same output as running id alone.\n\n|| is the logical OR operator, and specifies what to do if the first command returns false or fails (is non-zero).\nfrom man bash:\n\nThe  control  operators  &&  and || denote AND lists and OR lists, respectively.  An AND list has the form\ncommand1 && command2\n\ncommand2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero.\nAn OR list has the form\ncommand1 || command2\n\ncommand2 is executed if and only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The  return  status  of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.\n\nIn your example, ls -la runs successfully so the id command isn't run. If you did the following:\nls -z || id\n\nand try to pass an invalid option z to ls, then it fails and the id command gets run.\n", "Q: Recovering admin password on used netbook I had never heard of Ubuntu, but after using it with the limited guest access I would like to have more access. Play with it and see if I can learn to use it properly. I don't want to uninstall it, I just want to assign a new admin and password for full access. The previous admin no longer owns this netbook. I have made no serious attempts to recover the password because, although I am uneducated with modern technology, I am smart enough to know clicking the wrong button can cause severe damage. I really want to experience Ubuntu thoroughly and form my own opinion.\n\nA: It's true that reinstalling Linux will be your best option. As you are a new guest user, you likely don't have much useful information or any files worth keeping, and even if you do, you can back those up to any cloud storage (Sync, Dropbox, et al), a USB flash drive, or SD card, amount other things. You could even plug your cell phone into the USB slot and copy stuff over to there.  \nThat being said, to create a bootable Ubuntu medium is pretty easy. There is a wealth of information here and abroad for how to do that; A pretty easy way is to use unetbootin but you would need the admin password to install any new apps. You could potentially dd an ISO file to a USB stick, but that can really do harm if any type errors are made.  \nNot to make assumptions about your level of competence regarding those things, they are viable options. This link\nhttps://linuxconfig.org/recover-reset-forgotten-linux-root-password\nas well as many threads on this site offer methods for resetting the root password, which is actually very easy. If you have another computer, though, I would suggest burning a CD or making a bootable USB stick and installing that way. You can even burn \"Live\" images, so that you can try different varieties before committing to one.  \nIf you insist on resetting the root password, you need to drop into a shell at boot and do some things there... I won't expand just yet although I do know the question is how can you reset the root password. \nGood luck, and follow up with us with the direction you intend to go.  \nCheers!\n", "Q: Alt-F9 is missing in ubuntu's byobu Alt + F9 toggle send keys to all splits under fedora 22's byobu, but under Ubuntu trusty this combination doesn't even appear in help.

I can see pygame and beautifulsoup in that list.\n\nA: The issue is that when you install things with sudo apt-get install (or sudo pip install), they install to places in /usr, but the python you compiled from source got installed in /usr/local. The python you actually end up running when you type python at the prompt is the one you compiled (based on the output of the python -c 'import sys; print(sys.path)' command), and it can't find the python packages installed in the /usr directory. However, Ubuntu comes with python (both python 2 and python 3) already installed in the correct location, where it will find the installed packages. So a general recommendation is to try not to mix installation methods like this. Ubuntu has many software packages available through the official repositories which obviates the need to do much compiling yourself, and it's generally recommended to install software via apt when possible.\nThat said, for python packages (like Pygame and Beautiful Soup), things can get a bit more complicated. Mixing pip and apt-get can cause troubles down the road, so one approach to keep things simple is to stick with just the system package manager. If you end up needing to use pip because the package manager doesn't have things you need (or up to date versions), it's better to work within virtual environments and use pip for all the python packages you need within that virtual environment.\nTo tell your system to find the default system python correctly (python 2, which is the default when you just call python), try rewriting the symlink that routes the python command at a prompt to the original destination:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python\n\nHopefully that should allow it to find the python packages you installed.\n", "Q: USB 'boot error'; possibly bad files?

Everything seems to work fine sometimes, but other times - much more often than not of late - these shares become inaccessible and seem to lock up a lot of my desktop environment... namely anything that tries to interact with the file system. It only happens from my linux desktop. I have a couple other Windows 10 boxes and they are able to access the shares without issue.\nThis is not the first time I've had this issue. At one point I was quite frustrated with it and couldn't resolve it so I ended up taking Windows out of the occasion and converting my NAS to FreeNAS (CIFS). I didn't end up liking it, but the mounts never gave me issues with locking up. I've since gone back to Windows as my needs require it and I missed the AD integration / ease of management. It wasn't long before the locking issue came back though.\nI'm mounting these shares with cifs-utils via /etc/fstab like so:\n//<ip>/<share> /mnt/media cifs auto,_netdev,rw,noperm,credentials=<<path to creds>>,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,sec=ntlm 0 0\n//<ip>/<share> /mnt/storage cifs auto,_netdev,rw,noperm,credentials=<<path to creds>>,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,sec=ntlm 0 0\n\nI've tried doing some research and have not had any luck finding anyone else with the same issue. The closest I've found is people mentioning the gnome network manager potentially causing a similar issue, which is why I put the _netdev argument on there - but it didn't help.\nI'm thinking that maybe when I installed the network-manager-openvpn-gnome package the issue started occuring. I use my VPN connection quite a bit though so getting rid of it really isn't an option.\nAs I mentioned, I'm a newb when it comes to Linux stuff (standard windows convert - trying to get better!) so I don't even know where to look for logs that would give me information as to what is causing it. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated as I'm out of ideas. Thanks!\n\nA: For those who face this kind problem, it is recommended to diagnose them using smbclient first. Because smbclient seems implement more background negotiation stuff than CIFS mount client. \n i.e.\nsmbclient //<ip>/<share> -I <ip> -U <username>\n\nIf you are able to got into the windows folder, that's mean you are having hard time with CIFS mount options, it can be ANYTHING. \nThe next step is fire up sniffer like WIRESHARK. Then capture the package of smbclient, then compare to your CIFS mount.  Then try command line mount before you edit /etc/fstab. e.g. \nsudo mount -vvv -t cifs //<ip>/<share> /mnt/media -o credentials=<<path to creds>>,noserverino,sec=ntlmssp\n\nas in here, because I notice the packget sniffer show me error from server refuse my inode, thus I am getting lucky by trying out noserverino.

I say \"leased\" because it was manually done but is still one record. Anyway, I suspect this causes a hiccup on the router's IP tables so I've decided to use a different IP in the mean time instead of figure out how to clear the IP tables on my router.\nCheers!\n", "Q: Ubuntu webapp-container doesn't allow using different input source I've created a .desktop file for  accessing web-based version of wechat , specifically file is ~/.local/share/applications/wechat.desktop , with the following contents.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=WeChat\nType=Application\nExec=webapp-container --name=\"WeChat\" --icon=/home/xieerqi/.local/share/applications/wechat.png \"http://wx.qq.com\" \nIcon=/home/xieerqi/.local/share/applications/wechat.png\nTerminal=false\n\nWith sogou pinyin input method, I cannot switch the language to Chinese, it stays in English even though I manually change it via indicator and such.

Is there any possible fix for this?\n\nA: You'll need to install proprietary hp plugin with hp-plugin to use some of the advanced options, e.g. duplex printing.\nOnce the binary plugin installed as described on hplip page, Printers > HP_Color_LaserJet_MFP_M477fdw > Properties > Installed Options will show new \"Duplex Unit\" option with a checkbox. Under Properties > Printer Options > Two-Sided now allows to select \"Long-Edge Binding\".\n", "Q: What's the difference between the unity7 and x11 plugs in snaps While snapping applications, I've seen some snapcraft.yaml files declaring either the x11 and unity7 plugs, or sometimes both.\nWhat's their actual difference and when should I use which?\n\nA: https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/guides/interfaces/ says:\n\nunity7\nCan access Unity7. Restricted because Unity 7 runs on X and requires access to various DBus services and this environment does not prevent eavesdropping or apps interfering with one another.\nUsage: reserved Auto-Connect: yes\nx11\nCan access the X server. Restricted because X does not prevent eavesdropping or apps interfering with one another.\nUsage: reserved Auto-Connect: yes\n\nLooking at the code of the x11 interface and unity7 interface things get even clearer. x11 just gives you access to X, unity7 gives you much more than that: access to icons, themes, pango, ibus, accessibility, accounts and much much more functionality on the Unity7 desktop (but other desktop environments too).\n", "Q: Can't Install popcorn-time I am trying to install popcorn-time on my ubuntu computer, and I am having no success, I have looked it up but the terminal commands have not worked for me and the file does not go automatically to the install like on windows or mac what do i do? \n\nA: When you unpack it, that already is the installation.

Your autoremove did remove this package, but did not purge it. sudo apt-get --purge autoremove would have done it, but now that it is removed, dpkg -P asterisk-config is necessary.\nThere may be other files that you need to purge, too. The key is to identify which package ships the files you removed, and to purge and reinstall those packages.\nThe command debsums -ec (install the debsums package first) will tell you which conffiles have been removed and which packages supplied them, so this can tell you what you need to purge and reinstall. Alternatively, for any file, run the command dpkg -S file to tell you which package supplied it.\n", "Q: Deleted empty partition via Disks, which hid others.

Not being sure if I had \"third party drivers\" or not, I consented to turn off Secure Boot.  \nIt all went well, including a reboot, although now I get an annoying \"booting in insecure mode\" message.  \nMy question is: Is this indication from \"Software and Updates\" adequate to confirm that I have no \"third party drivers\" installed?\n\n\nA: The easiest way to check if you have 3rd party DKMS modules is to use\ndkms status\n\ncommand.\nBut there is a possibility that you installed some modules without using DKMS. But you should know if you installed something from source.\n\nA: No, the indication from \"Software and Updates\" is not adequate to confirm that you have no \"third party drivers\" installed.\nI had the same issue this morning when installed updates to my Dell 64 bit UEFI system (Ubuntu 15.10).  I have a dual-boot setup with Windows 10.    Back when I installed Ubuntu last year, I had to install a third party driver for the wireless chip, so during this morning's update, I agreed/opted to disable secure boot. In my \"additional drivers\" tab in settings, it reports (like your screen shot), \"no propriety drivers are in use.\"  However, I know I installed a wifi driver from intel, named iwlwifi, which is listed when I issue \"lsmod\" from the command line.   \nI too am now getting the \"booting in insecure mode\" message during boot, but it doesn't bother me - it's a quick small message, and I interpret it in a positive light to mean simply that Windows is not in control of my boot process. \nNow on Linux version 4.2.0-42-generic.\n\nA: Had the same message,... Basically, if you are using proprietary drivers for your video chipset, or your wireless chipset, you are using 3rd party drivers. Commonly, AMD or nVidia drivers are proprietary. Some Atheros and Broadcom drivers are proprietary, as well. A dead giveaway is if you have dkms (Dell Kernel Module Support) run when you do a 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' (you typically won't see this unless you do your updates from the command line or you use synaptic package manager and view the update text window).\n", "Q: How to update sqlmap How to update sqlmap automatic SQL injection tool?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 15.10 and later open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install --only-upgrade sqlmap\n\n", "Q: Can't play Dota 2 I run a dual boot pc with windows 7 and ubuntu 16.04 running an intel core i5(4th gen) processor with 8 GB ram and intel HD graphics 4400.\nNow Dota 2 runs just fine on windows but lags like hell on ubuntu.

Not all of the encoding work is moved to the GPU, but rather the GPU accelerates and offloads some of the tasks.  There may be tools available to directly query the utilization of the GPU component (I don't know of them off the top of my head) -- these would confirm that your GPU is doing some of the work. \nOn my particular machine, the h264_qsv codec runs approximately 5x faster in frames/second terms than the libx264 codec, even though in both cases the reported \"CPU utilization\" is near 100%.\n[lwobker:/dtop/nobackup/]$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep 'model name'\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U CPU @ 2.60GHz\n\n[lwobker:/dtop/nobackup]$ ffmpeg -hide_banner -codecs | egrep 'qsv' | egrep '264'\n DEV.LS h264                 H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10 (decoders: h264 h264_qsv ) (encoders: libx264 libx264rgb h264_nvenc h264_qsv nvenc nvenc_h264 )\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Asus Mediatek MT7630E doesn't work I had this working on Elementary but then it stopped so I switched to Ubuntu and I still can not get this driver installed and working. \nI followed this tutorial \nhttps://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1796\nAs well as using the same install file but sudo bash install.

I recently installed Lubuntu on one of my junk machines. I want to use it as an entertainment center in the living room for everyone to use. While I was setting up the PC, I used a cheapo monitor, which Lubuntu picked up as 1280x1024, it's native resolution, even without drivers. Now, I tried to plug it into my TV (native 1080p) and I went in to change the resolution. The only options were 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768. Can I have some help? Please keep in mind that I am pretty new to Linux as a whole and still have a lot to learn. Thanks!\n\nA: I had similar issues connecting to a TV although mine was 1368x768, so my exact answer won't apply.  But you may be able to use the same method.\nYou can try to add a \"mode\" by opening a terminal and typing cvt 1920 1080 60 (if 1920 x 1080 is the resolution you want, otherwise change the numbers). This will generate a line of data that you need for the next commands.  Copy all the line of data except for the word Modeline, and type the command\nxrandr --newmode ****  where *** is the data that you copied\nFor the next command you need to know your display output name. It's probably VGA1, but make sure by typing xrandr by itself. Now type the command\nxrandr --addmode *** XXXX where *** is your display name and XXXX is the first part of the data line, the part in quotes.  Mine was 1368x768_60.00\nFinally try switching to the new output by typing\nxrandr --output *** --mode XXXX where the fields mean the same thing as in the previous command.\nIf this all works, there is a way to automate it at login.  Post a comment and I'll add that to the answer if you get this far.\nEdit: my exact commands, to use as an example are:\nxrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1368x768_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1368x768_60.00\n\nEdit 2: Assuming the output is VGA1, your commands could look like\nxrandr --newmode \"1280x720_60.00\" 74.50 1280 1344 1472 1664 720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x720_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x720_60.00\n\n", "Q: Can't mount my external hard drive I have an external hard drive which I partition sometime ago. I made two partitions in one I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and the other I use for storing various files. It was working OK last time I used it and that was about 3 months ago. Today I plugged it in and received this message:\nError mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/shanks/515644a4-1492-4b80-b364-32b98755693b: Command-line `mount -t \"ext4\" -o  \n\"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid\" \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/shanks/515644a4-1492-4b80-b364-32b98755693b\"' exited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,\nmissing codepage or helper program, or other error  \n\nIn some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail or so.\nI don't know what to do. \n\nA: I've done this with external HDDs using Ubuntu 16.04, 14.04 and 12.04, I'm assuming that is what you're attempting. I recommend using these as a base to troubleshoot from, then if needed remount the drive.\nI start with Gparted to identify the device, usually its /dev/sdb1 or similar. \nThen I find the device, there is a drop down in the top right (at the moment) to change between devices. Once you have located your USB device select it.\nI like to use EXT4 format. To do so:\n1 - select the HDD (usually sdb1 or similar) note the path for later use\n2 - Right Click and choose Format\n3 - Select EXT4 (or whatever format you like)\n4 - Click on the Green Checkmark to apply the changes\n5 - Label the device by Right Click and choose Label, I stick with EXT-HDD for my external HDD\n6 - Click on the Green Checkmark again to apply the label\nHere's where it gets a little confusing, and may be entirely based on the brand of HDDs I used, but skipping this step caused me issues. \n7 - After you have saved the changes, disconnect the EXT-HDD\n8 - Leave it disconnected and shutdown (NOT REBOOT) your PC\n9 - plug the EXT-HDD back into the same USB port\n10 - turn the PC back on\n11 - get to the desktop and open up a terminal and become root\n12 - Identify the Devices UUID with this command and the path you noted from step 1:\nblkid /dev/sdb1\n\n13 - Note the UUID for the device\n14 - Create the mount point you want with this command:\nmkdir /mnt/exthdd \n\n(or similar depending on where you want it mounted and pointing to) Note that mount point for later use\n15 - open and edit fstab via terminal to look give it mount point and permissions\nnano /etc/fstab\n\nadd the line (use tab between values):\nUUID=<enter your devices UUID>     /mnt/exthdd     ext4     auto     0     0\n\n16 - save changes to fstab\n17 - give permissions to the created mount point\nchmod 777 /mnt/exthdd\n\nExit terminal and reboot. \nAt this point your PC should boot fine and have a new mount point. Any issues start over and double check everything. There have been devices I can get mounted on the first try, and for some reason others take a few tries, so don't loose heart. To ensure it mounted, there should be no errors during boot also go to that mount point in your files and see what the size of the volume is, it should be about the size of your USB device. \nGood Luck and Enjoy!\n", "Q: Stock Ubuntu images in Digital Ocean cloud Recently I came across a discussion where a commentator pointed out that OVH uses modified Ubuntu images in their cloud service. That means that when I choose to deploy an Ubuntu image on OVH cloud I won't have an original Ubuntu.\nI am currently client of Digital Ocean (DO) where I have Ubuntu deployed. I have noticed in the sources.list file some DO repositories (preceded by a warning comment ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu team) . I understand that they have mirrors to speed updates and limit their bandwidth use, but I am concerned about the originality of the images I am using, thus my question: How I make sure the packages I am using come really from Ubuntu's packages? Is modifying the sources.list files sufficient to have the right packages?\nNote: DO has  had in the past a security problem, due (in my understanding) to the cloud images they use.\n\nA: The only public clouds that receive official Ubuntu images are listed on this page: http://partners.ubuntu.com/programmes/public-cloud\nCurrently Digital Ocean is not on that list, so there's no way for us to confirm that you're getting an official image.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 can't install GRUB I am receiving the following error during installation:\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sda\nExecuting `grub-install /dev/sda` failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nI clicked \"OK\" and was prompted to do one of the following:\n1.

Cancel installation\n\nI plan on only running Ubuntu 16.04. I do not plan on dual-booting with Windows or another OS. So do I still need a bootloader if Ubuntu is my only OS. And if so, how should I proceed to install the bootloader?\n\nA: Hi GVS and welcome to Askubuntu! I believe I see the problem: You haven't created an EFI partition! This partition is where the installer will place grub during installation on a UEFI system, but without that partition, grub can't be installed. To fix this, we will need to re-partition your drive. Please follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type gksudo gparted (ifgparted is not installed, then you must run sudo apt install gparted, first). Once gparted is open, right-click on each partition and click \"Delete\". \n\n*Create a partition 300 Mib in size, formatted as FAT32. \n\n*Create your other partitions as normal.\n\n*Right-click your first partition (the one formatted as FAT32), choose \"Manage Flags\", and then click the check boxes for \"boot\" and \"esp\".\n\n*Lastly, click the \"Apply All Operations\" icon near the top of the window.\n\n\nAfter following these steps, you may run the installer as normal. Please let me know if you need any further assistance :)\n\nA: I had the same problem. Following the advice of @user311982 with a twist, I was able to install Ubuntu 16.04 from the installation media. Follow the normal installation procedure(s) until you are presented the options to install/overwrite/side-by-side/do-something-else the installation. Choose \"Do something else\". From there you can select the target installation, revert the partition table (remove partitions) and then create a partition with the \"EFI Partition\" option. My assumption is that this essentially does what @user311982 was saying about \"boot\" and \"esp\", but was simplified. Since you removed the existing partitions, you will want to use the remaining disk space for your normal \"ext4\" partitions.\nThen just proceed as normal.\n\nA: After a few unsuccessful attempts, I finally installed boot-repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nand was able to load into my Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and creating a FAT32 partition with \"boot\" and \"esp\" flags GRUB could be installed.\nHowever, now Ubuntu 16.04 is not starting, GRUB gives a \"unknown filesystem\" error.

Deleting the episode actually marks the entry as hidden and it seems you need to edit the database manually to unhide.  Try this;\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Rhythmbox\n\n*Open ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml in a text editor\n\n*Find the <entry> by searching for the episode title/URL etc.\n\n*Delete the line <hidden>1</hidden> in the entry\n\n*Change the line <status>100</status> in the entry (downloaded) to <status>103</status> (not downloaded)\n\n*Save the file and start Rhythmbox\n\n\nYou can also delete the entire <entry>...</entry> block and update the feed and it will reappear.\n", "Q: LVM Full disk encryption on two disks with single passphrase I have two disks, and want to have all storage managed by LVM and fully encrypted. However, the Ubuntu installer only offers the choice to set this up for one of the disks.

It should print out the file information and a line number, followed by the total number of files in the directory, but nothing happens.\nWhat's wrong with this script?\n#!/usr/bin/awk\n\nBEGIN { \n    files=0;\n}\n{\n    files++;\n    print files, \"\\t\", $9, \"\\n\", $3, \"\\n\\n\";\n}\nEND {\n    print \"Total Files:  \", files, \"\\n\\n\"\n}\n\n\nA: Issues with original script\nThere's a few problems with your script. First of all, the first line should be #!/usr/bin/awk -f. Second you said,\n\nIt should print out the file information and a line number\n\nbut in  your script  this part counts line number instead of file count, which is also redundant , because AWK has NR and FNR variables that already do that: \n{\n    files++;\n    print files, \"\\t\", $9, \"\\n\", $3, \"\\n\\n\";\n}\n\n\nProper working approach\nAs far as I understand, your main requirement is to print line count in each file and print total processed files in current directory. This can be easily done with bash on command line:\n$ counter=0; for file in * ; do [ -f \"$file\" ] && [ -r \"$file\"  ] &&  { wc -l \"$file\"; counter=$(($counter+1)); }; done ; echo \"Total files:\" \"$counter\"\n45 center_active_window.py\n41 get_terminal.py\n91 typescript\n1 xprop.txt\n17 xrandr_script.py\nTotal files: 5\n\nIf you insist on doing this with awk , it's possible as well , but pay attention - all files in the directory should be regular text files and readable.\nBelow is the script and its sample run:\n$ cat ~/filecount.awk                                                                                                    \n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n\nFNR==1{\n\n    if (FNR!=NR){\n        print counter,last_file;\n    }\n    filecounter++;\n    last_file=ARGV[ARGIND];\n    counter=0\n};\n\n{counter++};\n\nEND{\n    print last_file,counter;    \n    print \"Files processed: \", filecounter;\n}\n\n$ ~/filecount.awk *  2> /dev/null                                                                                        \n45 center_active_window.py\n41 get_terminal.py\n91 typescript\n1 xprop.txt\nxrandr_script.py 17\nFiles processed:  5\n\nThe idea here is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*every time line number in file ( the FNR variable ) is 1 , we record filename using ARGV array and ARGIND variable. We increment file counter, and set line number to 0;\n\n*if the record number isn't the same as record number in current file, that means we've already processed at least one file, so we can print out the information about it. That's what the if (FNR!=NR){ . . . part does\n\n*Essentially we're processing file, and then looking backwards at its info. \n\n*Once we're through all files, we need to print information about last one (because remember, the script works by looking backwards at all items) , and then print the total file counter.\n", "Q: How do I increase MATE volume beyond normal range in PP?

The \"Output Volume\" slider at the top of the window should allow you to boost the output volume well beyond 100% (to about 150% or so)\nIf your videos are standalone files, you could play them in VLC; turning VLC's volume up (it goes up to 200%), in combination with turning Ubuntu MATE's own volume control up, should give you a considerable boost in volume.\n", "Q: ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2) I have installed apache2 and mysql-server-5.6 on linux ubuntu 14.04, when i browse ip address apache is working fine, but mysql is not running--> I have run commands sudo service mysql start or service mysql restart from the terminal, then output is came like this start: Job failed to start.\nCan anybody help me about this issue, how to connect mysql.\nBefore this I have installed Xampp server on same system and already made it stop using /opt/lamp/lamp stop command.\n\nA: I have had this issue before.

[AMD/ATI]\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       version: 80\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm pciexpress msi vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=radeon latency=0\n       resources: irq:27 memory:a0000000-afffffff memory:b0000000-b07fffff ioport:3000(size=256) memory:d1600000-d163ffff memory:d1640000-d165ffff\n\nSo .. the only commonality I can see at the moment is the Saturn model name, which the M6100 has. The M6100 is based on the Radeon R9 M280X. I sincerely hope it isn't a Radeon HD 8950, as that put's it on the same ball park as the M380.\n\nA: You have a FirePro M6100.\nYou can see this by looking at the MAC output where it states that there is 2GByte of video memory. A Radeon R9 M380 would have 4GByte.\nLinux and Phoronix are reporting this because this is what the card is telling them.\n", "Q: ubuntu crashes during bootup if Nouveau drivers are not configured I am using Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS and I am facing issue with the installation of Nvidia drivers. I read over the internet that to successfully install nvidia drivers I need to either blacklist nouveau drivers or uninstall them. Since 'nouveau' driver is configured in the kernel, so I built a new kernel image with initramfs. I configured the kernel without nouveau driver. But during bootup I see the text messages for few seconds and then the screen goes black and then the system shuts down by itself without showing me anything on console.\nHas anyone seen this issue ?\nIs there something I am doing wrong ?\nThanks\n\nA: Setting kernel boot parameter nomodeset fixes the problem.\n\nA: If you want to get the best performance out of your GPU, you should be using the drivers from Nvidia. It is easy to do this in Ubuntu. Install from the PPA by Graphics Driver Team if you want the latest drivers.\nFollow along if you need help installing from the PPA. \n\n\n*\n\n*Add the PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\n\n*Update apt:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Search for the latest drivers:\napt-cache search nvidia-graphics-drivers\n\n\n*Install the latest driver from the list (currently nvidia-graphics-drivers-367):\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-graphics-drivers-367\n\nThat should do the job.\n", "Q: PHP extensions installed through apt are not working When I try to install PHP curl extension through apt, I get a message saying I already have the newest version installed.\nHowever, it doesn't get loaded into PHP.

Ctrl+|) in a IPython session I get a Quit (core dumped) message. Where is this keybinding bound and how can I deactivate it? \n\nA: It sends SIGQUIT to an application which does produce core dump. It is the same as if you typed kill -3 PID where PID is you program process id.  \nFor more info, read  https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html\n\nA: Don't know what \"system level\" means, since it's vague.\nThis is the old-fashioned terminal (tty) interface. You can control how key sequences are processed, at the terminal-driver level. See stty. For instance,\n\nstty quit ''\n\nshould disable the default translation of ctrl-pipe into a QUIT.\nUltimately, doing this at the shell command-line may not help you, since some interactive apps impose their own stty settings, thus overriding/undoing what you already set at the command-line.\n", "Q: Failed upgrade to 16.04 because it failed upgrading a package The upgrade is stuck for more than 24 hours.

(In my case, I made the bootable thumb drive from Mac OS X (Mac Mini), but I was running it on a Thinkpad X220 Tablet. So I think that the booting problem is not specific to the Macbook). \nYou need to first format the thumb drive and then run unetbootin and setup Ubuntu on it. \nTo format the thumb drive from Mac OS X, you can follow these instructions and format as MS-DOS (FAT). Essentially you need to use the Applications>Utilities>Disk Utility, select the drive, and then format as FAT. \nThe issue came because you did not format the drive first. \n", "Q: cairo-dock (fallback) won't run at start-up (ubuntu 16.04) I worked through all the commands in macbuntu so that I could get the el-capitan desktop, and the final step, using Cairo-dock to put the menu on the bottom is giving me fits...\nI run cairo-dock (fallback) and click to NOT use openGL (makes stuff jumpy and unattractive), and right click the cairo-dock and click where it says run at startup.

Here's the problem. I had a bunch of files in a directory. Then I created another directory in that directory. Then I cobbled together this command:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec mv {} ./1 \\;\n\nThis command was supposed to take all the files in the directory and move them to that newly-created directory, but instead of providing the name of the directory, I screwed up and typed 1, as you can see from the code snippet. So, I ended up having just one text file named 1 that now contains the stuff from one of the disappeared files and that's all.\nIs there any chance I could recover the lost files (or possibly the actual data from the files--they were all text files) or are they pretty much permanently gone?\n\nBefore:\nmisha@hp-laptop:~/Documents/prgmg/work$ ls\nadd.s  bubble.s  cpuid.s  div.s    hello.s  mult.s       sum.s   test.s\na.out  c         demo.s   gas.txt  max.s    print_arr.s  test.c\nmisha@hp-laptop:~/Documents/prgmg/work$ mkdir asm\n\nAfter:\nmisha@hp-laptop:~/Documents/prgmg/work$ ls\n1  asm  c\n\nSo, as you can see, I wanted to put all assembly language files into the asm directory.

And afterwards i could extend the partion to the whole SSD size? \n\nA: There are many ways to do so, most of them relying on dd and resize2fs behind some frontend if you don't want to do it manually. I would recommend CloneZilla, which will also resize your partitions and write new partition table. \n\nA: There is many approachs..\nFor now I only describe one method.\n1) \nRun a live distro of Ubuntu from CD or USB.\nBackup your system (Ubuntu) ext partition and other partitions contain any data,except boot or any small partitions designed for your bootloader.generally these are at the very beginning of disk.\nYou can use ubuntu's built-in tools like gnome-disks or gparted to backup (copy).\nIf you are able to attach both source and destination drives to a Live-running system then there's no need to backup, and just copy these partitions to second disk.\nMake sure there's enough empty space between destination partitions if you need to enlarge them later and about 1GB of space at very beginning of second disk for creating boot partition.\n(Hint:We don't copy boot partitions because there's some codes in it point to exact UID of each partition that is meaningful only for first disk)\n2) better you enlarge (expand) your partitions right after previous step.\nCreate new partitions or expand them to your desired size\n3) Run live version of boot-repair disk..\nOr any live ubuntu disk with pre-installed boot-repair application.\nHowever this step is a bit geeky to perform.\nTry to repair your grub bootloader with these tools. Don't worry about loosing your data as long as there's backups of partitions.\nYour bootloader will be ok for sure.\nPS. Don't forget to remain some storage for swap partition (about 1.5 to 2 times of your RAM,if you need it)\n", "Q: How to fetch build packages from other apt repositories in snapcraft I'm trying to build a snap that depends on gtk3d, the packages for which are only available in the Debian archive: \nhttps://packages.debian.org/sid/libgtkd-3-dev\nIs it possible to get build-packages to fetch packages from additional apt repositories than archive.ubuntu.com? Or is there another alternative to get snapcraft to fetch the packages from Debian?\n\nA: You can do this now by writing a very simple custom plugin (based on the 'nil' plugin).  Just put a sources.list file (containing the repos you want to install from) in your project's top-level directory, and put the following code in parts/plugins/your_plugin.py\nimport snapcraft\nimport os\n\nclass YourPlugin(snapcraft.BasePlugin):\n    @classmethod\n    def schema(cls):\n        return {\n            '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#',\n            'type': 'object',\n            'additionalProperties': False,\n            'properties': {},\n        }\n\n    def enable_cross_compilation(self):\n        pass\n\n    @property\n    def PLUGIN_STAGE_SOURCES(self):\n        return open('sources.list', 'r').read()\n\nAfter that, you may need to worry about gpg keys for the sources.  You can just add those to your system's apt keys.\n$sudo apt-key add <file with repo's gpg key>\n\nDepending on which repos you are trying to use in your snap, you may need to specify some special options for apt.  You can do this with a custom apt.conf file.  My apt.conf looks like this.\nAcquire::ForceHash \"sha1\";\nAcquire::CompressionTypes::Order { \"bz2\", \"gz\"; };\nAcquire::Languages { \"none\"; };\n\nYou can make snapcraft use this file when it calls apt internally by setting an ENV variable.\n$export APT_CONFIG=<path to custom apt.conf file>\n\nFinally, edit your snapcraft.yaml to use your new plugin.\nparts:\n  custom-part:\n    plugin: your_plugin\n    stage-packages:\n      - <package from custom repo>\n\nNow, you can run \"snapcraft snap\", and it should install packages from the repositories listed in your custom sources.list file instead of the system's.\n\nA: As of right now, there currently isn't a way to do this unless you build your snap on a Debian system, in which case, it will fetch the packages from the Debian repos.\nUniversal distribution support is coming, just not yet.\n", "Q: Installing openstack with Juju and MAAS I'm currently trying to deploy an Openstack cluster using Juju and MAAS on Ubuntu 14.04.\nI have 6 servers, one allocated as my MAAS server and the rest are enlisted and commissioned by the MAAS server.

It is working fine, but video performance is very far from \"smooth.\" Any ideas on how to install the Hyper-V Linux Integration Services (LIS)?\nI found an article that said to edit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules, but that didn't help at all.\nhttp://www.serverwatch.com/server-tutorials/installing-and-activating-hyper-v-linux-integration-services.html\n\nA: I also tried out Hyper-V on Windows 10 Pro with Ubuntu Desktop 64-bit 16.04 LTS as guest system. I am not satisfied with the graphics performance. I do not know if i missed out a setting. If anybody finds a good solution i would be happy to know about it too.\nBut this is what i did. I read and followed the information from the Microsoft documentation on TechNet. There is a table with features of Hyper-V. Most interestingly in this case is the row mentioning \"Hyper-V specific video device\". But it does not mention anything about Windows 10. Only about Windows Server host systems.\nI did not change anything in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules. However, i followed the instructions and installed:\n$> sudo apt-get update\n$> sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-virtual-lts-xenial\n$> sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-tools-virtual-lts-xenial linux-cloud-tools-virtual-lts-xenial\n\nThen reboot.

I already have Windows 10 and ubuntu dual booted in my laptop and I would like to triple boot it with El Capitan. \nIs it safe? And will it affect other OSes? \n\nA: Sure it is!  Grub is not limited to only 2 operating systems.  As as long as you have readable partitions that have OSes that grub can detect, it will work just fine.\nI personally have 3 Operating Systems;  Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 and Windows 10.\nTo answer your second question, no, it will not affect the other OSes.  For one, Windows cannot read EXT partitions out of the box.  You need to install software which can read EXT in order to access those partitions.  At this point, you're doing this on your own.  \nLinux can access the partitions from other OSes, even the Windows NTFS partitions.  However, this where labelling your partitions and knowing what is what is key.  \nBy default, a Linux OS itself will not ever mess with other partitions at all.  You can manually access other partitions if you mount them, but again, at this point, you need to be aware that you're browsing the files of another OS and tread carefully.

When I put in the windows disc nothing happens so i have read that i need to remove Ubuntu first.  I have no idea at all how to do this. Can someone please give me the step by step to remove it. I greatly appreciate anyones help. I have never removed software but was so thankful to be given the computer that i have so i need to get windows on it so that I can use it. Thanks! \n\nA: You need to simple install Windows following the normal procedure.  This will typically involve placing the installation disc in the drive and setting your computer to boot from this drive (this is dependent on your motherboard, but may involve pressing F12, F2, or DEL during initial boot first, then selecting the CD/DVD drive as first boot device).\nThere is no need to \"uninstall\" the previous operating system, and Ubuntu does not support such an action.\nThe normal method for completely replacing the previous operating system is using the installation procedure for the new operating system, and when prompted, tell it to utilise the entire hard drive for the new system, which will result in the loss of the old operating system.\n\nA: *\n\n*See what shows on your first screen when you start your computer. it would say press Esc, F1, F2, F10, F12, or Del or something to enter setup. It is fast, you have to focus on your screen. If it doesn't show that, try to press these keys fast.\nMy picture shows to press Del at the buttom of screen.\n\n\n*find the option called \"boot\" or \"boot priority\". Choose the first one, press enter or something, change it to CD/DVD.

I'm not allowed to add more than 2 pictures before I get 10 reputations or something. And I'm not an English speaker, if you don't understand my sentences tell me.\nSo, you have to on your own to finish the 3rd step. Good luck.\n\nA: First put the disc in the drive and shut off the computer. Now, turn it back on and press the key to enter boot menu. It is different for most PC brands, for example on most Dell computers the key is F12, but it should show up on the first screen once you press the power button. When on the first screen, press that key a lot until you get to the menu. Now, use the arrow keys to navigate to something like CD-ROM drive. Press Enter and now the computer should be booting from the disc.\nHope I helped!\n", "Q: lenovo no inbuilt wifi how to connect to wifi using adapter I am using lenovo 3000 g 430 laptop which does not have built in wifi I bought a tplink TL w572n adapter i can install its drivers on windows easily but coming to ubuntu it doesnt get like that please help  me as soon as possible\n\nA: It could just be that it simply doesn't have drivers for Ubuntu.

Likewise you can be sure if you add a new drive or partition it won't conflict.\nThe UUID is unique to the drive/partition itself, not to the port the drive is plugged into or the order in which it's configured in your CMOS settings.\nUsing the label can achieve a similar function, but it is probably my least preferred choice, because there is a high likelihood of name conflicts - if you ever attach a new drive that also has a partition with the same label, it becomes ambiguous which one should be chosen.\n\nA: If you have not mounted any partition under the mount point /home, then your given /etc/fstab is okay for a swap partition and an ext4 partition which is mounted under \"/\" root mount point as root partition.\nAnd almost all Linux systems use \"ext4\" partition system as default   unless otherwise stated. And your home directory is there at /home under root partition, :)\n\nA: Nothing is wrong with yours; there are many possible ways to write an fstab.

The typical ones require the internet to download packages, but there are others where an internet connection is only optional, because the install media is large enough to contain enough packages for a working system.\nIf the downloaded image file is only a few hundred MB, or less, you probably have a network installer, which requires the internet.\nYou will want one of the \"desktop\" ISO images, which are typically around 1.4GB in size.\nThis is a large initial download but will ensure that you can install a working system even with no internet connection.

I know there are utilities like watch which monitor the system size but they are level triggers i.e. they monitor on a regular basis. What i want is an edge trigger(sort of a callback, a triggger) which activates on the above defined condition. What is the best way to write such a trigger on a debian based system. Please suggest methods in bash, C, C++, python or java.\nWhat i meant by edge trigger is that whenever the system state is critical ie the usage is above say 80% a trigger should be generated. I dont want to poll every say 1 hr to check the state. \nLemme elaborate a bit about my use case. On every request(via get or post api) the request body is pushed to kafka. Say kafka went down then the logs are written to the system and now i have a script which rotates logs on s3 only when the systemm state is critical. \nIn this case as u can see the kafka wont go down quite often. Say it went down once every 6month so having a thread to check the directory size every 1 hr is just waste of resource.

Can be done simply like so:\nif [ $(df / --output=pcent | awk -F '%' 'NR==2{print $1}') -ge 80 ] ; \nthen \n   # do something here \nfi \n\nThat basically  calls df command with output limited to percentage use and / filesystem , and trims the output so that only percentage is returned. If  percentage is greater or equal to 80 , it would execute whatever you place after the # do something here  comment.\nIf you want continuously running solution , here's a Python script that checks your filesystem usage every 0.25 seconds.

Can anyone help me with this. I am using ubuntu 14.04 lts and i'm trying this from a scaleway server.\n\nA: Why don't you use, the regular aws cli? I never had any problem with it, and maintained by the provider. I recommend it because I had some issues with s3cmd.  \nYou can install it easily with pip install awscli, then just run aws configure (where you have to enter some config details and credentials). If you don't have pip installed, you can just install it with sudo apt-get install python-pip. \nRight after that, you'll have a tool with a little bit wider functionality like multiple accounts and regions. \nIf you want download your file, run:\naws s3 cp s3://bucketname/folder/file /local/folder/file\n\nFor uploading you can use:\naws s3 cp /local/folder/file s3://bucketname/folder/file\n\nIf you want to copy an entire directory recursively, just use locations and the --recursive option:\naws s3 cp /local/folder/ s3://bucketname/folder/ --recursive\n\nIf you also want to keep your local files and do a sync between the local folder and the s3 bucket, you can use:\naws s3 sync s3://bucketname/folder /local/fodler\n\nAnd it also have a great \"help\" functionality: aws help or aws <command> help. \n\nA: Use the endpoint of s3 bucket.\nEx URL: bucketname.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\nYou can obtain this URL in s3 properties.\nuse the URL instead of bucket name to download.\n", "Q: How to make sub domains run on ssl along with domain I have bought a wildcard ssl certificate for my website let say www.example.com\nI am using ubuntu 14.04 server on AWS hosting and using apache 2.4. My domain is booked from godaddy.\nI wanted two of my folders js & css to show up as sub domains ie. js.example.com and css.example.com. So that on page load all the files from css and js folders load faster.\nI have managed to enable settings for making css.example.com and js.example.com in apache. Also I have configured ssl certificate with my website and enabled https ie. https://www.example.com\nNow the problem is, I am unable to setup ssl or secure vhost for my js & css sub-domains.\nNow when I open my website with https://www.example.com, warnings are appearing in console for unsecured origin of js and css files. How do I fix this problem?\n\nA: As it stands, you can't.\nYour certificate (I'm assuming) is for www.example.com; not for js.example.com, css.example.com or anything else.example.com.\nA certificate that is for anything.example.com is a wildcard certificate and they cost more.\nAn alternative would be adding Subject Alternate Names (SAN) to your certificate to cover js.example.com and css.example.com, but you'd have to do that at the requesting stage - you can't do it retrospectively.  Chances are, there would be charge for that too.\nSo your options are to purchase a replacement certificate, or alternatively, move your css and js to a subdirectory on your website so that they are accessed as https://www.example.com/css and https://www.example.com/js using your current certificate.\nHowever, if you have purchased a wildcard certificate or a certificate with SANs that cover all your various domains and are still getting errors, then the issue is likely to be with Apache.\nYou need to make sure that the Apache subdomain for both ccs and js are also using https.  If they use http you'll get the warnings you state.\n", "Q: How do I delete files using the Gutmann Process? I've been trying to delete some files, large ones in particular, to help smoothen out my system, Is there any command or programm that deletes files via the Gutmann Process?\n\nA: The built-in command to do that is shred. It is part of the Gnu CoreUtils, and thus already installed.\n\nshred: Remove files more securely\nshred overwrites devices or files, to help prevent even very expensive\n  hardware from recovering the data.\n\nSee https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html, which mentions Peter Gutmann's paper, or see man shred.\n\nA: There are at least two tools in the official repositories that allow you to overwrite files using the Gutmann method:\n\n\n*\n\n*scrub:\nInstall it using sudo apt-get install scrub.\nUse it like scrub -p gutmann /PATH/TO/FILE_TO_ERASE\n\n*The secure-delete tools suite:\nInstall it using sudo apt-get install secure-delete.\nThis package contains the tools srm (erase files), sfree (erase free disk space), sswap (erase swap) and sdmem (erase RAM). \nAll of the tools use the Gutmann method. Find more about each of them by typing\nman COMMANDNAME.\nTo erase a file, use it like srm /PATH/TO/FILE_TO_ERASE.\n\nWarning:\nModern file systems and hardware make secure erasure of files very hard. There are a few cases where even after a seemingly secure wipe of a file, remaining data fragments may still persist on the disk. This includes (no complete list):\n\n\n*\n\n*SSDs can not be securely wiped on a file by file base. They contain a wear level controller that distributes write access evenly over all memory cells of the device, so if you tell it to overwrite all clusters occupied of a file, the actual hardware writes may occur on completely unrelated cells, leaving the original data untouched.\n\n*HDD caches improve speed of modern HDDs, but there's also no guarantee that all of its contents are securely deleted and especially that all write commands were performed immediately as instructed. They might get cached by the HDD and performed later, maybe even skipping consecutive writes to the same sectors and only performing the last one...(?)\n\n*Journaling file systems like ext4 may log data writes in a special invisible journal file before performing the actual write in the data section of the partition. This is to ensure that in case of e.g. power failure or a crash, the data which was about to get written can be restored and the file system is not left in a corrupt state. However, depending on the mount options, there can be either only file metadata (Ubuntu default) or even real data fragments left in the journal which do not get securely erased.\n\n*...\n", "Q: Convert pdf to an editable format, retaining images I have pdf files I need to convert another format. The files contain images and text. I need the pictures.\nI tried to convert using abiword but the result unfortunately gets only text.\nCommand I use:\nabiword --to=doc file.pdf\n\nI think that the format \"odt\" will be the best. Unless there's another way to draw the same pictures.\n\nA: If there are just a few figures to extract from the pdf file, you can use a GUI-based method, only possible if you have a photo editor (it is likely you have GIMP installed). Here it is a detailed process of how to do it (dispense me if you are an expert on this, but it might be good as a reference for others):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the pdf file, and put one picture in the screen so that it covers most of the screen (for example, if you are using Evince, just press F11 and adjust zoom). (The larger the picture on screen, the better the quality of the extracted file)\n\n*Press print screen key in keyboard.\n\n*Select Open with: your favorite photo editor (probably GIMP).\n\n*Use the rectangle selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to extract. To enable this tool, use the Toolbox panel or press R. Once you have selected the area, copy it using Ctrl+C and paste it as a new image using Shift+Ctrl+V. Then, select Export As from File menu, or press Shift+Ctrl+E. Then you can save the picture in any format you like. Just change the extension or select in the menu at the bottom.\n\n\nIf you have many pictures to extract, or you prefer a command-line method, use the pdfimages tool. To use it, install the poppler-utils package (you might have it already):\nsudo apt-get install poppler-utils\n\nThen, open a terminal window, go to the folder where you pdf file is, and run:\npdfimages -j file.pdf photo\n\nThis will extract the pictures from file.pdf and save them as photo-001.jpg, photo-002.jpg, etc (in the same folder where the pdf file is).\n\nA: Open the pdf file with OpenOffice/LibreOffice, delete the text and save the file as odt.  odt means 'open document text' file. It is the native format of OpenOffice.\n", "Q: Change Unity Launcher Style I want to change my launcher to look like the one Kali Linux uses, as shown in the image:\n\nIs that possible ?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu GNOME, which, like Kali, uses the GNOME3 desktop environment, or more simply install GNOME3 on your current system.

However, there are only two choices for the skip and count units. skip and count must match the bs value or be specified in bytes. To set the units to bytes you must add an additional operand of iflag=skip_bytes for skip and iflag=count_bytes for count or iflag=skip_bytes,count_bytes for both.\nIn your case, this command should accomplish your goal:\ndd if=image.iso of=test iflag=skip_bytes,count_bytes bs=4M \\\n  skip=$((1161215*512)) count=$((32768*512))\n\nIt appears you want to extract exactly 16M.

It also allows you to boot Ubuntu in recovery mode.\nThe EFI/ubuntu/MokManager.efi entry will boot a MOK Manager tool. MOKs are \"Machine Owner Keys\" which are used to sign boot loaders. This is needed if you want to enable your UEFI system's \"Secure Boot\" feature and add new trusted boot loaders. You will probably not need it as average use, it's easier to turn \"Secure Boot\" off.\nSystem Setup will get you into your UEFI setup. You should be able to achieve the same by pressing a special key like Del or F2 (depending on your UEFI) before GRUB starts.\nAll other entries will pretty sure boot into Windows equally.\n\nIf you want to tidy up your GRUB menu by renaming, deleting or reordering some entries or putting them into submenues, you can do this most easily using a tool called grub-customizer.

After installation, DO NOT upgrade LOL. Just copy the installation folder from your virtual machine, and paste it inside the PlayOnLinux Vitual Drivers folder, into the default, or another prefix made by playonlinux. For example. On playonlinux, create a new virtual disk named \"League_of_legends\", install the desired components on this disk like, IE8, Adobe Air, etc. Paste the installation folder of LOL into the folder of this virtual disk. In the Miscellaneous tab on playonlinux configuration of your virtual disk, click on Run .exe on this virtual disk. Browse for the LOLLauncher.exe. The game should open the patcher, and start the update. I have done this process like 3 times, and always works for me.\nHope this helps.

I don't need to repeat characters, so I wouldn't be missing anything.\nIs this possible, and if so, how?\nThank you :)\n\nA: There isn't currently any quick and easy way to enable this kind of functionality on the desktop version of Ubuntu.\nPersonally I'm a big fan of the default compose key shortcuts; I find them faster and a lot more intuitive than mobile-style long press selection (â¥). That said, if you have the time and determination, you might be able to piggyback the slowkeys option in the default core Universal Access application to build something similar to the mobile option.\nPoking around in that myself, XKB seems to be associated with slowkeys control. You can use XKB to configure and enhance Ubuntu's keyboard bindings, and as far as I can tell, this section has what you need. So it shouldn't be that (relatively) difficult to have an alternative character print when a key is long-held.\nWhere things get complicated is assigning multiple special characters to a keystroke (example: hold down \"a\" and get options for Ã¤, Ã , Ã¡, Ã¢, etc.). How do you cycle through the options? Do you have the characters pop up in a dialogue window, then use the mouse, tab or arrow keys to select one? Seems time consuming.\nOr you could assign different hold lengths to different characters. 100ms hold for Ã , 200ms hold for Ã¡, 300ms for Ã¢... But remembering how many seconds are for which characters could get tricky, not to mention assigning all of them individually would be a headache. Plus when you get into longer lists of characters you could be sitting there holding a key for a good 3-4 seconds. Seems even more time consuming.\nRather than slowkeys, you could try the repeatkeys option instead to have multiple taps of a key provide a special character: 3 taps of \"a\" for Ã , for instance. But then you run the risk of having unwanted special characters popping up when you type anything like \"good\", or \"eerie\", or \"aaaaaaahhh!\"\nYou may have come up with some other, more efficient implementation method that I'm not thinking of, in which case go forth and modify! But I'll still recommend compose key combinations in the meantime. âº\n\nA: I'm certain that this is possible to do by modifying the keyboard interrupt service routine (ISR). Whenever a key is pressed, an interrupt signal is sent to the CPU. The CPU will then service that interrupt by running the keyboard ISR. \nISR's are low-level programs, typically coded in assembly language, because they deal directly with hardware and must be fast. Here is more info on hardware interrupts on the Intel processors and how to use them.\nKeyboards have had their own processors since the days of the original IBM-PC, and can generate characters very rapidly if any key is held down.\nA couple of definitions might be useful here:\nRepeat Delay: The time lapsed between pressing the key and when it starts repeating.\nRepeat Rate: After a key is pressed, the keyboard will repeat that key. The speed at which it repeats is the repeat rate. Sometimes called the typematic rate.\nThe keyboard ISR routine would have to be modified to substitute the Repeat Delay function for an 'Alternative Character' function. The timing of the key press and release is the essence of it. By measuring the duration of the key press, the ISR (or interrupt handler) would know to pass on either the normal character of the alternate character (the key \"beneath\" it)\nEssentially, you would be modifying or re-writing the device driver for the keyboard.\nThis is just a high-level view of the approach I think would be needed to achieve what you want. \n\nA: Because the touchpad functions similar to the touchscreen in Android it would provide a better interface than the keyboard. Indeed a whole new set of routines could be implemented to zoom by moving thumb and forefinger together and zoom out by reversing direction could be implemented.\nThe touchpad can already sense one-finger, two-fingers, even palms accidentally moving against the touchpad and hence ignored. Acceleration and deceleration speeds are recognized. It's already controlling the mouse pointer for the text you'd want to highlight with a long press.\nIt should be a piece of cake for programmers to add an extra bit of code to measure touch press length and bring up a context sensitive menu for select, copy, paste, etc like the smartphones do today.\nI think your question is a great idea that can evolve software and keyboards with builtin touchpads to a whole new level. I should point out that some touchpads built into keyboards have a colour lcd screen which could take your idea even further. ie, screen text being highlighted can be mirrored to the touchpad lcd and zoomed in for fine movements.\nApple, Google, Microsoft and Linus could all be excited with your idea. It's certainly piqued my interest!\n", "Q: Installed wrong libc6 on ubuntu 14.04 and now I'm lost Before anyone says use the search function, I did, and I found a topic very similar (Installed wrong libc6-dev Version) so I will provide the same outputs from commands that were used there, but I'm too newb on ubuntu to adapt the solution to my problem :/\nOnto the topic, I was installing some stuff onto my server and one post suggested tampering with the sources.list files, so I did and I knew it was a bad idea...\nFastforward to now I cant use apt-get install, apt-get upgrade or anything in apt due to it telling me the libc6 library is too new, and I don't know how to downgrade it because the dependencies are all mixed up :S Pls Help!\nThe following are outputs of commands I tried, which were also asked for by the OP of the other post:\nOutput of apt-get upgrade :\nReading package lists...

Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nReboot and let us know if it is working as expected.\n\nA: 1.Download from  https://github.com/FireWalkerX/ath10k-firmware/blob/7e56cbb94182a2fdab110cf5bfeded8fd1d44d30/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin?raw=true, then rename to board.bin.\n2.Download from  https://github.com/FireWalkerX/ath10k-firmware/blob/7e56cbb94182a2fdab110cf5bfeded8fd1d44d30/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-4.bin_WLAN.RM.2.0-00180-QCARMSWPZ-1?raw=true, and then rename to firmware-4.bin\n3.Put all above to /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/\n4.reboot your machine\nfinally,my solution come from : https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1604345#p1604345\n", "Q: How can I combine application launchers into one launcher icon? I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. My launcher is full of icons and I want to categorize it by creating separate folders for each category. Is it possible? If yes then please explain me how to do it.\n\nA: GUI quicklist editor\nCombining (commands to start-) applications is one of the options of QLE Unity Quicklist Editor. Although you can create a new icon and add your applications, I'd suggest adding your application shortcuts to an existing launcher icon, like below:\n\nAdding applications to an existing icon\n\n\n*\n\n*In the QLE main window, In the left column, you'll find the current Launcher items, click on the launcher you'd like to edit (Gimp in our example):\n\nIn the right column, you'll see possible quicklist (right-click) items of the launcher (currently none).\n\n*Click on the  icon, a drop-down list will appear, choose, \"Add an application shortcut\":\n\n\n*In the (alphabetical) list that appears, pick your application and click \"Add\". Repeat untill all the applications you want to add to the iconb are added.\n\nThat's it. This way you can save a lot of space in your Unity Launcher.\nNote\nThe quicklist editor is currently being rewritten in Gtk, mainly for \"cosmetical\" (appearance) reasons.

The same issue has been reported on the Dell forum here. If someone has a forum account, please point them to the various reports on askubuntu. I tried to sign up, but failed. This should also be reported at launchpad. \n\nA: it's me as well experiencing the same issue. Seems like an issue with the 3.19.0-65 kernel.

This is caused by a change made by Canonical whereby kernel and kernel driver signing is now being enforced when secure boot is enabled. During the update process, when a pop-up box asked me to review the secure boot settings, I left them as they were (enabled, I assume). \nSee:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dkms/+bug/1574727\nand\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1566221 \nAs recommended in \nhttp://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19985774\ndisabling secure boot from the BIOS corrected the problem for me. \nYou could also use sudo mokutil --disable-validation from the terminal.\n", "Q: Heavy load by APT unattended-upgrade 16.04 Xenial\n\nAPT automatic update check: enabled\nAPT automatic update download & install: disabled\nNo cron jobs listed below,\n$ for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do sudo crontab -u $user -l; done\n\nThe system suddenly topped by heavy load pertaining to both CPU and Network IO from the aroused unattended-upgrade for several minutes.\nWhy could it happen when automatic update download & install were totally disabled?\n\nA: The functionality on unattended-upgrades is automatically enabled after the installation of 16.04 Xenial Server. I mistakenly didn't really disable it so observed the unexpected behaviors above. Method Two here I had followed is unlikely effective.\nTo properly disable the automatic updates, we need change the configuation on /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades from:\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";\n\nto:\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\"; \n\n\nA: If your OS uses systemd then:\nsudo systemctl mask unattended-upgrade.service\n\nwould also stop it from automatically running. \nThe main issue I have is: why is it taking up 100% CPU for downloading some files?\n", "Q: Shell script in Ubuntu raspberry pi 2 I am writing the shell script in Ubuntu for raspberry pi 2.

Did this cause harm?\n\nA: No, python -v has not changed anything or done any harm.\nUpon initialization, It will show you the modules that are being initialized and the respective files from which they are being loaded. Upon exit, it will show you the unloading information of the loaded modules. So, for understanding, you can take -v as verbose.\nOn the other hand, to get the version, use python -V or python --version.\nAlso, in these kind of situations always start with reading the man page i.e. do man python.\n\nA: When not sure of commands best to check man in terminal. Most packages have a man command\nman python\n\n\n   -v     Print  a  message each time a module is initialized, showing the\n          place (filename or built-in module) from  which  it  is  loaded.\n          When  given twice, print a message for each file that is checked\n          for when searching for a module.

So far so good.\nWhile it was finalizing the installation, suddenly an error message popped up:\nScreen shot of grub failing:\n\nAfter that the screen was responsive (I could move mouse, open file explorer, click on icons) but I couldn't run any command in the terminal, not even sudo reboot.\nSo I did a hard reset, booted from the flash drive again into Ubuntu live, but now to my surprise, the laptop's SSD drive had disappeared and not only Ubuntu installer couldn't find it, I couldn't find it anywhere. It had disappeared!\nTo make the matter worse, now whenever I boot into Ubuntu live, the laptop freezes after a few minutes and I have to do a hard reset again.\nAny idea what might have gone wrong and how I could go about this?\nThank you!\n\nA: I have the same laptop (ideapad 100s) and I recently installed Linux Mint 18 on it.\nI dont know what went wrong with your installation (where you trying to install a 32bit version of ubuntu?, the BIOS is 32bit but CPU 64bit as you probably know), but I will post here what worked for me, It might help you.\nSo, I made a live usb with mint 18 64bit and I copied bootia32.efi to the EFI/BOOT/ directory on the USB drive. bootia32.efi\nReboot, and install as usual. At the end of the installation the same error will pop up, telling that grub has failed to install (it tried to install a 64bit grub2).\nNext, use the 'blkid' command to find the PARTUUID of the partition where you installed linux, you will need it later. Shut down and reboot with the live usb. When shown the grub prompt press 'c'. This will bring you to the grub2 command line.\nThere, you will have to type:\nset root=(hd?,?)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz??? root=PARTUUID=<output of blkid>\ninitrd /boot/init???\nboot\n\nWhere you'll have to find out where your root is, tab autocomplete is your friend. If you fill in the gaps succesfully, you'll boot with the linux installed in the HDD. There, you will have to install grub 32 bit:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-ia32\nsudo update-grub2\n\nAt this point you should be able to reboot normally.\nTo get the wifi working I followed the exact same steps as you.\nI found that the laptop froze quite often due to the bay trail c-states issue: bugzilla. To adress it, you will have to edit the grub config file and add intel_idle.max_cstate=1 to the line starting with:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz...\nI still cant get the sound working though.

(Note: I realise that you have already followed this path but best to check.)\nFollow this path:\nClick on the clock > Time & date settings... > Clock\n\nAnd from here select 12 hour time as illustrated in this screenshot:\n\nIf this is not enough and the clock is still not obeying your needs try running the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall the clock\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install indicator-datetime\n\n\n*Reconfigure the date/time \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata\n\n\n*Reset the 'unity-panel-service'\nkillall unity-panel-service\n\nAnd this may be enough to reload the offending clock and tweak it into obeying your preferred settings..\nNote: These tips will have no effect if your current locale does not support AM/PM as Gunnar Hjalmarsson has pointed out...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/399178/57576\n\nA: Probably the effective locale for the LC_TIME locale category is one which misses AM/PM specification.

If you change it to e.g. English (United States) or English (United Kingdom), AM/PM will show up next time you log in.\n", "Q: Shrink too large VDI \nSo, I accidentally enlarged a 48GB .vhd disk to 120TB, instead of 120GB in Virtualbox. Realizing the error, I am now trying to bring it down to 120GB; however for obvious reason, modifyvm --resize is not working. See error in second image. Is there anything I can do to shrink my disk image to 120GB?\n\nResizing error\n\nA: Unfortunately we can not \"shrink\" a virtual hard drive that we accidentally grew too much with using the VBoxManage command.\nThe only means of repair would be to create a new virtual drive of appropriate desired size and copy the data over.\nStill, there is no harm done on creating such a huge drive as long as we do not actually partition and use it.\nThe drive is of dynamically growing type as only then we can resize it at all. It will therefore not use any more physical space on the host drive than needed. Unused virtual hard drive space will not use any physical space.\nIn case we had partitioned and used the additional space we may be able to  compact it again as shown in this answer.\n", "Q: Installing Roccat Tyon driver and libgaminggear I'm trying to install the drivers and the gui for my roccat tyon gaming mouse.

This type has an nvme drive and is set up by the BIOS as RAID, not AHCI (cannot be changed). I see multiple comments on the various forums that indicates that this should be possible.\nHowever, when I boot from a USB drive, I cannot see the SSD at all. It does not mount, gparted does not see it, fdisk does not see it. \nThe BIOS sees it--I can boot into windows on that drive. \nKernel version is 4.4.0-21-generic. Gparted is 0.25.0. \nAny pointers much appreciated.\n--prasanna\n\nA: At this point in time, it is not possible to install Linux on this machine. There is a very instructive thread on Lenovo's forum:\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/m-p/3339206/highlight/true#M7814\ntl;dr: until Lenovo provides a BIO setup to disable the RAID, Linux cannot be installed. Lenovo said it might do it but no hard commitment.\n\nA: The problem is as you said, Linux Kernel doesn't recognize NVME SSD drives on SATA Controller RAID mode. The solution is to change our BIOS settings to allow changing SATA Controller mode from RAID to AHCI.\nDoing this means flashing BIOS to the specific version that allows us to do that. Also to be noted that when using AHCI mode we won't be able to run factory Windows installation. So if we install Ubuntu alongside Windows we will have to switch SATA mode every time we switch operating system.\nNext solution is specific to Yoga 900-13ISK2, but if you have some other model version that has the same problem you'll have to adapt my answer searching for that specific model BIOS update for Linux only.\nHere is what you have to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download YOGA 900 BIOS update from this URL.\n\n*Flash your BIOS executing the file you downloaded. It's possible that you might receive an alert sign saying the version of your BIOS is newer than the one you are trying to update. In this case follow point 3\n\n*(OPTIONAL) Flashing 'older' version of BIOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable \"Bios Back Flash\" in the \"configuration\" BIOS setup menu or the downgrade will fail.\n\n*Run downloaded exe file. It will start unpacking files to some temporal folder. Next, the alert message will appear. Ignore it, let that window live for a moment. \n\n*Go to the folder C:\\Users\\(YourUserNameFolder)\\AppData\\Local\\Temp and you will see a folder named something like 7zXXXXX.tmp. Copy this temporal folder to some other place to keep it safe. \n\n*You can close up now flashing BIOS window we ran earlier.\n\n*Edit the copied temporal folder file platform.ini. Search for not commented [Bios_Version_Check], you will see on next line a flag value set to 1 or 2. Change this value to 0 and save (it will allow no version Bios check).\n\n*Run this folder file runnable exe, probably named H2OFFT-W, you will see then version check will be skipped.\n\n\n*After BIOS update is complete, you'll have to enter BIOS setting. It will require you to power off your Yoga. While turned off, press (using a clip or something pointy) the button next to power button that has a curved arrow pointing down. This will power up your computer and show a list of options including entering BIOS setup.\n\n*Enter Bios Setup, go to Configuration and set SATA Controller mode to AHCI. Save and exit.\nThat will do it. Next time you run ubuntu installer it'll show SSD drive and all its partitions.\nNB: the device will be called /dev/nvme*, not /dev/sd*.\n", "Q: Can't install mysql-server on 14.04 Ubuntu Server 14.04, everything on the server is fully updated.

To control the size you can use the -s parameter.\nOpen the terminal and type:\nonboard -s 640x205 -x 0 -y 0\nThe -s parameter is telling onboard it should be 640 pixels wide and 205 pixels high. \nI found that and more at this LINK\n", "Q: Authentication agent and i3wm How does one turn on an authentication agent like Polkit when using the i3 window manager?

This might or might not affect your background image, depending on what it is.

If you happen to know available theme names, you can manually replace it there with an alternative one. Yet, it is easier to use a GUI-based manager.

There are also plenty of themes online.\n\n\n*\n\n*Advanced Webkit LightDM: If you are not happy with the above, then this one will surely work. With this one you can create any theme you like using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. If you know these languages, you can achieve what you want. Sadly that goes beyond my knowledge so I cannot help you, but I'm sure there is plenty of help online. Alternatively, try to find a theme online that matches your preferences. There are some amazing themes out there! To install, run this:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-webkit-greeter\nTo use (according to this web) \"copy the files located in /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/webkit, and create a new folder there (such as /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/mytheme\".

I need to share port 18090 on my local are network, however something is blocking it.  netstat -ltn shows that 127.0.0.1:18090 is listening.  I have issued both sudo ufw disable and sudo /etc/init.d/ufw stop, yet for some reason no devices can connect to this port on this server's IP.\nWhat could be blocking this port from listening?\n\nA: Whatever process you have listening on 18090 is only listening on your local loopback interface. Incoming connections from other hosts on your LAN are likely hitting some other interface (e.g. the IP address on your eth0 interface), and your daemon/process isn't listening on that interface. Ergo, you will need to tell your process or daemon that is opening port 18090 to either bind to the LAN IP address or to bind to 0.0.0.0 (possibly in it's configuration).\nWhen you can get netstat -ltn to list your LAN's IP with port 18090 OR 0.0.0.0:18090, then you can worry about firewall rules. \nAdditionally, if you want to 'clear' the firewall rules and be wide open, try sudo iptables -F\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu's full disk encryption require no time? As far as I understand, the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option in the Ubuntu installer is meant to provide full disk encryption.\nHowever, when using that option, it seems like as if the encryption would finish instantly, it literally does not seem to take any time at all.\nWhen using BitLocker on Windows to encrypt the entire disk, it can take hours to fully encrypt the disk, even on SSDs. With BitLocker and other encryption tools like DiskCryptor or TrueCrypt for example, there's also a progress indicator, which shows how much of the disk is encrypted already.\nWhy is that not the case with the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option in the Ubuntu installer?\nEven on my 1 TB SSD the encryption seems to be set up instantly and there's no progress indicator whatsoever.\nHow's that possible?\nSomeone on the forum said:\n\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2330425&p=13516293#post13516293\nData doesn't become encrypted until written\n\nBut if that would be true, then the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option in the installer is not full disk encryption at all.\nIf he is correct, then it does not encrypt the entire disk then. It only encrypts used disk space. The empty space is not encrypted then.\nAt least with BitLocker you have the option to choose between encrypting used disk space only or encrypting the entire disk, see following screenshot for example:\nhttps://i-technet.sec.s-msft.com/en-us/windows/jj983729.bitlocker-screen(en-us,MSDN.10).jpg\nOn the same forum thread it was also mentioned that:\n\nIf you want to randomly initialize the storage areas PRIOR to writing anything,\n  that will take some. I seem to recall it being an optional checkbox for the installation.\n\nAnd, indeed, there is a \"For more security: Overwrite empty disk space (The installation might take much longer.)\" option on the next screen after the screen which has the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option.\nNow, the question is: If that option is checked, does it just overwrite the empty disk space? Or does it also encrypt it?\nI was assuming that it only overwrites it with zeros before encrypting it. I was assuming that the entire disk would be encrypted anyway using the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option, regardless of the \"For more security: Overwrite empty disk space (The installation might take much longer.)\" option.\nRegards\n\nA: Okay, before I answer your questions, I need to first explain the difference between \"Quick format\" and \"Full format\" (to borrow Windows terminology), and the difference between a logical volume and a physical volume:\nQuick format: Writes the file system structure onto the drive (on top of existing data).\nFull format: Erases the drive (typically by writing 0's) before writing the file system structure.\nAll file systems in use today (ext2, ext3, ext4, btrfs, zfs, xfs) perform a \"quick format\" by default. This means that previous data that resided on the disk, while not directly visible through the file system, is still available if you were to scan the disk using data recovery software.\nAs an example: you have a 100GB hard drive which used to store photos. You decide to format this hard drive and install Ubuntu. Let's pretend the Ubuntu installation will take ~4GB. After installing Ubuntu approximately 4GB of the 100GB of data would be overwritten with your Ubuntu installation. The remaining 96GB of photo data is still physically present on the hard drive. If you used data recovery software, you should be able to retrieve most of these photos, despite the fact that the drive was \"formatted\" during the Ubuntu installation.\nLogical volume: Any region of a storage medium, up to and including the entire physical space. e.g. if you create a partition of 100MB on a disk of 100GB, the 100MB partition is considered a logical volume\nPhysical volume: The entire physical capacity of the hardware^. In our example with a 100GB hard drive, the physical volume is the entire device (100GB) without any smaller volumes allocated inside.\n^ The hardware itself will have additional capacity (over provisioning) to handle degradation of the physical medium. This additional capacity is managed by the device itself and is not visible to the operating system except through the S.M.A.R.T. interface, which you can access by installing smartmontools.\nNow on to your questions...\n\nBut if that would be true, then the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option in the installer is not full disk encryption at all.\n\nThis is a difference of definition/perspective. You are interpreting \"full disk encryption\" as meaning the entire contents of the physical volume is encrypted, while Ubuntu is using \"full disk encryption\" to mean the contents of the logical volume where Ubuntu is installed is encrypted.\nTherefore if you installed Ubuntu and filled up the hard drive completely with data, the encrypted logical volume would fill the entire physical volume.\nHowever there are cases where someone installs Ubuntu along side Windows on their disk. In this case, the Windows installation may be unencrypted but the Ubuntu installation is encrypted.\nIn this scenario, Ubuntu is still providing \"full disk encryption\" because all data on Ubuntu's logical volume is encrypted. Ubuntu doesn't care about the data on other logical volumes which are present on the physical volume.\n\nIf he is correct, then it does not encrypt the entire disk then. It only encrypts used disk space. The empty space is not encrypted then.\n\nYes because encrypting empty space would make the system much slower, and there is no security benefit to doing so.\n\nNow, the question is: If that option is checked, does it just overwrite the empty disk space? Or does it also encrypt it?\n\nI have not verified myself, but it is most likely overwriting the unused disk space with random data. It is certainly not encrypting the empty space. Properly encrypted data is indecipherable from random data, so filling the disk with random data before installing Ubuntu would make it impossible to tell which portions of the disk are \"empty\" and which are encrypted\n\nI was assuming that it only overwrites it with zeros before encrypting it. I was assuming that the entire disk would be encrypted anyway using the \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option\n\nAgain, \"full disk encryption\" in this context refers to the encryption of all logical data on disk, not encrypting the entire physical device.\nThere is no security benefit whatsoever to encrypting empty space. If you are concerned about free space not being encrypted, then select the \"For more security: Overwrite empty disk space (The installation might take much longer.)\" option during installation to overwrite the entire physical disk.\nNow, it is possible to purchase a self-encrypting drive (SED). For SSDs the relevant feature is called OPAL. If your computer has an SED installed, the encryption is handled by specialized encryption hardware within the device. All data written to the physical medium (magnetic platters for a hard drive, or silicon for an SSD) is encrypted by the device before being written. This means if someone were to remove the platters or silicon chips, they cannot read the data. However, it does depend on you trusting the SED's encryption implementation. As the device firmware is closed source and rarely audited, you're placing trust in the vendor to have implemented it properly and without any backdoors. You decrypt the SED at boot by providing a password.\n", "Q: Can't login after update 14.04 Secure Boot After applying an update I'm not able to login in graphics mode.\nThe last update ask me about Secure Boot.\nNow I can only login in command line mode.

Otherwise, the whole current directory would be deleted.\n-not -name \".\"\nThen you want to test for directories only:\n-type d\nAnd, if everything looks good, you want to delete these directories:\n-exec rm -rf {} \\;\nwhich says \"for all found directories, execute this command\".

Is there an auto-dismount in veracrypt or should I always unmount veracrypt volumes manually before shutting down to prevent a broken filesystem/container?\nI found the answer for Windows in the veracrypt FAQ, but not for Linux / Ubuntu. \n\nA: There are so-called run levels and script are executed when a new run level is entered. On Ubuntu, these are stored in /etc/rc<run level>.d. Run level 0 is shutdown and run level 6 is reboot. So you want your script to be in /etc/rc0.d and in /etc/rc6.d.\nCreate the file /etc/init.d/unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh and make this its content:\n#!/bin/sh\nveracrypt -d -f\nsleep 3\n\nThen execute these commands:\nsudo chown root /etc/init.d/unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh\nsudo chmod 751 /etc/init.d/unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh /etc/rc0.d/K00-unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh /etc/rc6.d/K00-unmount-veracrypt-volumes.sh\n\nI chose K00 so the script is executed as the very first one when one of the run levels is entered. Those scripts are executed in increasing ASCII order, so the smaller the number of the symlink's name, the earlier a script is executed.\n\nA: As of March 2017, a user going by the name of Bob indicates that volumes are not automatically unmounted. It is probably a good idea to take UTF-8's advice and create the run level/init script.\n\nA: Here is an update, which should be the right answer!\nI learned in the veracrypt forums that the option to control dismounting upon shutdown and/or suspend was introduced in version 1.19. There is no need to create the init.d scripts described above.\nYou can see this for yourself. I use the Ubuntu ppa provided a veracrypt package, in which there is a file called /etc/default/veracrypt in which the following setings are included:\n# If enabled, the following option calls 'veracrypt -d' at shutdown. Although\n# all filesystems are unmounted automatically at shutdown, only calling\n# 'veracrypt -d' will stop the VeraCrypt processes and remove any device mappings.\n# It probably isn't necessary to do this, but it shouldn't hurt.\n\nVERACRYPT_SHUTDOWN_UNMOUNT=\"yes\"\n\n# If enabled, the following option calls 'veracrypt -d' during suspend and hibernate.\nVERACRYPT_SUSPEND_UNMOUNT=\"yes\"\n\nIn case you want to try, here's the ppa file:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/unit193/encryption/ubuntu cosmic main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/unit193/encryption/ubuntu cosmic main\n\nand the version as of 2018-12-26, veracrypt-1.23.0vanirl~18.10.\n", "Q: How to install a telnet client? How can we install a telnet client in Ubuntu 16.04? With this command, we can install a telnet server:\nsudo apt-get install xinetd telnetd\n\nBut can a telnet client be installed without a telnet server? A telnet server can be dangerous.\n\nA: You shouldn't need to install any packages; a telnet client should come standard with Ubuntu. Just open a terminal window (Alt + Ctrl + T) and use the telnet command (for help, type man telnet)\n\nA: A lot of docker images don't come with standard tools like vim, ping & telnet. You may need to install them explicitly.\nsudo apt-get update && apt-get install telnet\n\n\nA: apt-get update \napt-get install telnet\n\nThis is a valid question BTW. Do not install the telnet server, ever. Also the telnet client is not included by default in many distros. For instance it is very common in docker-land to face the need of installing several tools that are taken otherwise for granted. For example, Official OS docker images most likely will be shipped with a shell and its built-ins. Telnet will not be shipped in any of those.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 16.04 desktop icons after update I did a clean install of Xubuntu 16.04 a couple of weeks back.

It's the same as $HOME\n~/.local/bin is a subfolder named bin in the subfolder named .local in your home folder.\nYou can use \n~/.local/bin/pip3\n\nto call your new pip3 executable. It may be easier to add ~/.local/bin to the $PATH environment variable, see How to add a directory to my path? so you don't need to type ~/.local/bin/ all the time.\nMake sure you add it before the old value of $PATH, like\nPATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin/:$PATH\"\n\n\nA: ~/.local/bin has been added to the PATH in Ubuntu 16.10, and backported to 16.04. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bash/+bug/1588562\nIf you're running Ubuntu >=16.04 with all updates, it should already be fine.\nIf not, you can add it manually :\nFor a single user, edit the file ~/.profile, and add at its end :\nPATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nIf you want any newly-created user to have this, you can add this same line at the end of /etc/skel/.profile\n\nA: I was just doing this today, seems like clear documentation is scarce for people who want to keep some control over what's installed, and where.\nSupposing you have run pip3 install whatever, it defaults to put stuff under ~/.local, as you know.  Its customary in Unix to divide the file types, put the \"runable\" ones under ~/.local/bin.\nIn a terminal, type this to see your path now:\n$ echo $PATH\n\nCheck that you do have the installed python stuff in ~/.local\n$ ls -la ~/.local/bin\n\nThat confirms the executable files are there, or does for me. If those file permissions show \"x\" they are executable.\nNow, add that directory to the path within the terminal\n$ export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH\n\nCheck your path again to see the change. Please remember that is a temporary setting only for that terminal session.  It does not apply to other terminals at the same time or in the future. It is a good place to test things.\nAfter that, every program executable within ~/.local/bin should run if you type its name in the command line. There is no need to run \"~/.local/bin/jupyter\", for example. Just type \"jupyter\".  No need for the \"./\" that you see sometimes, that's when you launch a program from the working directory which is not in the path.\nIf you later decide you want to make that permanent, so that ~/.local/bin is always in your PATH, you can do that by editing some environment configuration files. Depending on your setup, for example, in my home folder \".bashrc\" file, the last line is \"export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\". So I could put $HOME/local/bin on the front of that.  Note I wrote out $HOME, not \"~\" in there.  Then every time I use a BASH shell, PATH would be fixed. If you might use other shells, I think the right thing is to edit the ~/.profile instead.  I think all shells in Ubuntu will source that file. \nIn my case, I installed several programs with pip3, such as jupyter. One way to make sure where that was installed into is to run\n$ pip3 list\n\nshows all of the packages available, not just ones installed by pip3.\n$ pip3 show jupyter\n\nIn my case, for example:\n---\nMetadata-Version: 2.0\nName: jupyter\nVersion: 1.0.0\nSummary: Jupyter metapackage.

I'd warn you to not eagerly follow advice that some people here will offer, to run \"sudo pip3 xxx\". Generally, you would rather  run root installs only with Debian packages, not with pip3.  If you run without the sudo, you are confining the danger to the user account. If you goof while running a script as root, you might scatter files all around your hard disk and regret it.  Especially if other people log in and use that computer, avoid doing anything as root unless you are confident.\nAlso worth noting, that pip3 defaults to install into ~/.local, but that is not necessary.  Read \"man pip3\", look for \"-t\" (--target). You can specify the install directory. I think that is nice because you can confine any damage to one other directory and delete it whenever you want.  ~/.local might have other valuable things in it installed by other programs and you would rather not obliterate them.  I think of ~/.local as a place more for settings than programs anyway.\n", "Q: How to install Android on BQ Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition? I've been amongst the first users of BQ's Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet and I'd been waiting for a Ubuntu tablet for 4+ years.\nNow after playing around a lot my final rating for this device + OS is not a positive one.

You need to edit the relevant sources.list file and replace xenial with trusty. Here's one automated way to do it and update the package list:\nsudo sed -i -e 's/xenial-getdeb/trusty-getdeb/' /etc/apt/sources.list{,.d/*.list}\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen run\napt-cache policy filezilla\n\nto identify the version you want to install. apt-cache lists package versions and their originating source lines.

As you can see, the latest release of FileZilla -- 3.19.0-1ubuntu1 -- is only available for Ubuntu 16.10, which has not even been released yet. If your Mint distro is based on Trusty, from the normal repositories you can only get access to a three years old version of FileZilla -- 3.7.3-1ubuntu1. \nNow, as you say in your comments, you did a distro update (to an unstable distro?). That is a very risky method to get access to specific packages, as it can mess up other dependencies, which happened in your case. If you want to upgrade, it's always recommended to do a clean installation.\nActually, there is a much more safe method to get access to newer packages, without changing the distro: \n\n\n*\n\n*download the specific .deb file you are interested on (look in here and select according to your PC architecture)\n\n*(via a Terminal) go to the downloaded file's folder and install package with sudo dpkg -i file.deb\n\n*run sudo apt-get install -f to make sure there are no broken dependencies.\n\n\nThere you have a newer package in an older, stable distribution, without need to risk messing your OS.\n", "Q: Can not run a script downloaded with 'wget -o filename.sh ' I ran this:\nwget -o ready-for.sh \"https://training.linuxfoundation.org/cm/prep/ready-for.sh\"\nchmod a+x ./ready-for.sh\n./ready-for.sh LFS265\n\nand got the error:\nready-for.sh line-1 command not found\n\n\nA: You have used the wrong option of wget.\nTo save a document/file, you need -O (capital o).

It was built up from a minimal install and doesn't have most of the usual Ubuntu graphical elements: no Unity, no Gnome shell, no LXDE, and so forth (I use the i3 window manager). So directives like \"go to System > Utilities > . . .\" won't apply to a system like this.\nFurthermore, I've been using an old serial mouse on this system--a Kensington Expert mouse (trackball), which I really like from an ergonomic perspective. I've currently got it hooked to the system via a serial-to-ps2 adapter and it's been working acceptably for the most part--including the crucial copy/paste-via-middle-mouse-button functionality--though some odd quirks have cropped up lately. As a way of possibly addressing those quirks, I've decided to try getting the serial-to-ps2 adapter out of the picture and hooking it straight to the serial port.\nSo I found directives for getting a serial mouse functioning under Ubuntu (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SerialMouseHowto) and, implementing those directives and hooking the mouse to the serial port does result in a mostly working mouse. The problem is that one of the functions I use most and absolutely must have is not working under this scheme: I can, holding down the left mouse button and dragging, copy text from graphical or terminal programs, but I cannot paste it by clicking the middle mouse button at the desired location. In short, there seems to be no middle mouse button functionality present under this schema. So I'm looking into ways of possibly restoring that middle button functionality.\nI should mention that, of the possible inputattach options, none are a very close match for my mouse. I tried several and some result in a working mouse, while others do not. I tried initially --microsoft, but have also tried --mshack and --mouseman. With none of those do I get any sort of middle mouse button functionality.\nxev show, by the way, when the mouse is hooked to the system via the serial-to-ps2 adapter, that I have (starting from lower left and moving clockwise around the mouse) buttons 1, 2, 9, and 3 on this mouse. I suppose button 9 would be a good one to assign as a middle button. Or perhaps a combination of 2 and 9. But when I remove the adapter and hook the mouse straight to the serial port, xev indicates only 2 buttons are present: both upper and lower left buttons report as button 1, while both upper and lower right buttons report as button 3.\nSo, do I need perhaps to do some mouse button mapping? There are 4 physical buttons on this device. Perhaps I will need to put some supplementary xorg stanza in some /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ .conf file? Suggestions will be appreciated.\n\nA: I found a workable answer over at the stackexchange thread https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9973/configuring-mouse-for-rightleft-button-simulating-middle-click-for-copy-paste. It involves using the command xinput set-prop, specifically\nxinput set-prop \"$device_name_or_number\" \"Evdev Middle Button Emulation\" 1 \nOnce I'd done that, the middle mouse button emulation functionality I needed (paste on pressing buttons 1 and 3 in combination) was restored.\nAfterthought: this seems related to evdev, and I have a /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf on this system. Maybe my Option Emulate3Buttons true stanza should have gone there rather than in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?\nSUMMARY: to make this solution work on my system, I edited /etc/rc.local (as directives at the link cited in the OP instruct) and added the line\ninputattach --daemon --microsoft /dev/ttyS0\nto make the serial mouse mostly functional. Then, I added the line \nxinput set-prop \"$device_name_or_number\" \"Evdev Middle Button Emulation\" 1\nto my .xinitrc file (I don't use any login manager). After rebooting and firing up X, I had a fully working (at least to my needs) Kensington Expert Mouse. complete with middle-button-paste functionality. Issue solved, apart from understanding better how evdev and Xorg play together.\n", "Q: Error while copying: \"no such file or directory\" belkacem@belkacem:~$ sudo cp media/belkacem/01CF36CD84AC8C90/Originals/stvbios.zip /usr/share/games/mame/roms\ncp: cannot stat 'media/belkacem/01CF36CD84AC8C90/Originals/stvbios.zip': No such file or directory\n\nWhy am I getting this message?

Those usb drives don't have good write amplification management. Just the generation of log files will kill the flash. Buy more disks, spinning rust is fine.\n2) has the highest performance when you can stripe your IOs. otherwise all of your vms are competing for io bandwidth on that single disk. You can get some better performance on a single disk with a read cache (rapiddisk and others) at the expense of system memory but that doesn't do anything for writes. writes require a io controller with a battery backed cache or a main memory that can crash to flash like NVDIMM.\nIf you want to really know the performance impact, measure it.

I've seen this question but it relates to Unity DE.\n\nA: Introduction\nDisclaimer: I am author of this indicator\nThe lks-indicator shows status of the lock keys , like Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, and Num Lock. While originally written for Unity desktop, it works with some others, in particular with MATE. It has options for ignoring certain keys, or showing all and indicating which one is active.\nUsage\nAs shown by -h it has several command line options:\nusage: lks-indicator [-h] [--show-all]\n                     [--ignore-keys IGNORE_KEYS [IGNORE_KEYS ...]]\n\nlks-indicator - Indicates on/off status of Lock keys.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --show-all            Show all keys, and mark switched-on keys by surrounding with brackets. \n\n  --ignore-keys IGNORE_KEYS [IGNORE_KEYS ...]\n                        Ignore specified keys (C, N or S).\n\nLaunching is as simple as running in command-line (from the same directory where indicator is located)\npython lks-indicator \n\nTo close the indicator, please use the Quit button. Using Ctrl + C doesn't work well with indicators.\nInstallation\nThe indicator is available on GitHub\nFor those who have git installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /opt\n\n*sudo git clone https://github.com/SergKolo/lks-indicator.git\n\n*chmod -R +x /opt/lks-indicator/\nIf you do not have git installed, run sudo apt-get install git\nAlternatively , you can just download the repository as zip file.\nwget https://github.com/SergKolo/lks-indicator/archive/master.zip\n\nIndicator in action\nAs you can see below, the indicator displays green icon and which key is currently active. When no keys are engaged, the icon remains green\n\nUpdate September 2nd , 2016:\nThe indicator got a bit of update:\n\n\n*\n\n*monochrome indicator added, and can be used with -m option\n\n*label now uses circles to indicate which key is enganged\n\n\n\n\nA: If you prefer the terminal or dconf-editor, which also goes for regular Linux Mint, you can use this setting:\norg.mate.peripherals-keyboard-xkb.general duplicate-leds,\ne.g.\ngsettings set org.mate.peripherals-keyboard-xkb.general duplicate-leds true \n\nTested on Linux Mint MATE 18.1.\n\nA: Native Solution\nIt turns out that MATE-Tweak, built into the default installation of Ubuntu MATE, has an option to enable keyboard LED indicators\n\nUnder Interface, check the box Enable keyboard LED\n\nAnd now you have three key lock icons in your indicator panel - one for each key.

Can anyone give me some fairly clear instructions on how to get HAL installed for Firefox on 16.04LTS? I do realize it's being replaced, but anyone got a clue as to how to get my Hulu working in this instance?\n\nA: FIX for Hulu using Firefox v49.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (64-bit):\n(For Netflix, see further down below.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Flash 11.2 (use the APT download method via Adobe).\n\n*Install Zombie HAL. Restart your browser.\n\n*In Firefox go to Edit -> Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Content option.\n\n*Ensure that \"Play DRM content\" is enabled.\n\n\nAnother workaround is to use Google's Chrome browser.\nNetflix: After you do the steps above, you can also stream Netflix on Ubuntu using Firefox, but Netflix is annoying because they don't like supporting Firefox on Linux and because they use Microsoft's Silverlight technology (which is another proprietary competitor to Flash). A workaround is to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Pipelight for Ubuntu, then restart Firefox.\n\n*Install the \"User Agent Overrider\" add-on (I'm using version 0.4.1 by muzuiget). You do this by clicking on Tools -> Add-ons and searching for it there in Firefox.\n\n*Once you have the User-Agent add-on installed, you click on its button and you can choose one of the Windows identities. This spoofs to Netflix that you are on a Windows computer when you are actually using Ubuntu. Though, when I'm done viewing Netflix, I'll disable this spoofing feature by clicking on the \"Default\" identity as I want websites to know I use Linux. This way, I help to encourage more companies to support us natively. (Or you can leave the spoofing feature on if you're helping people to convert to Linux. So it seems to them that there are no \"weird bugs\" with using Linux.)\nOh, also, if Netflix throws you to an error page saying that you need Silverlight installed, you need to make sure that you enable the fake User-Agent spoofing BEFORE you visit Netflix not once you arrived at their site.\n", "Q: Grub is black/white , but I want my old Grub back :) I had an blank screen on the terminal-mode, via Ctrl-Alt-F1 (F1 - 6), on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and I followed the steps of izx and it worked, thx for that :) link to izx's solution\nbut now I have a black/white grub, which I don't like, so I was wondering if somebody can help me get my old grub back like this example from google:\n\nAnd this,is how my GRUB looks right now: \n\nI tried to edit my GRUB with the \"grub customizer\", but the resolution and colors don't change.\nbtw I'm relatively new to linux/Ubuntu :D\n\nA: I'm afraid there's no way to do so, without completely reverting izx's solution. Basically, what has happened is GRUB is now in a safe mode of sorts.

In it, ^ matches the beginning of a line, [[:digit:]]+ matches one or more digits, and $ matches the end of a line.  Because this regex starts with ^ and ends with $, it only matches whole lines.  An alternative way of matching only whole lines is to use the -x option:\ngrep -xE '[[:digit:]]+' foo.txt >bar.txt\n\nThe option -E tells grep to use extended regular expressions.

In Firefox Developer Edition, I'd like the title bar to change to the menu bar on hover. I've seen advice you can do this by setting the option \"ui.use_unity_menubar\" to true in about:config, but that didn't work.\nI've done a manual install of Firefox Developer Edition instead of using the PPA since I want the install to be side-by-side with current Firefox install - as described here: https://askubuntu.com/a/548005/428453\nAlso described in that link; the unity global menu will not be installed (by default) if doing a Firefox DE manual install... but it doesn't say how to install it.\nHow can I install/enable the Unity global menu?\n\nA: I... kind of have a solution, but it's at a compromise. Read the whole answer first.\n(Note that if you manually installed Firefox developer edition to /usr/lib/firefox like I did, you need to back it up as it will be replaced. Also back up your ~/.mozilla folder in case the following fails and wipes your .mozilla folder.)\nSo first, add the Firefox beta ppa with sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next\nInstall Firefox beta with sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade firefox\nNow run firefox -P and your developer edition profile should still be there. Select it and open Firefox. You'll have the latest beta on the ppa, as you can see with \"about Firefox,\" and you'll also have your developer tools and global menubar. \nHOWEVER, I'm pretty sure none of the tools specific to developer edition will update. Only the base browser will.\nCorrection: there aren't tools specific to developer edition that beta doesn't already have. By upgrading to beta, you aren't losing anything; it's just more troublesome than keeping developer edition.\nI immediately went back to my manual install with no global menu (and also a super annoying bug where the url bar doesn't autofocus on new tab) when I figured this out, so you may not want to follow these steps. But if you really want the global menu fixed now and also are fine with the current state of all the developer tools, this may be worth it. See above.\nOtherwise, I guess you'll be waiting with me for Mozilla to patch this bug. Bug resolved as wontfix since it's a lot of trouble and Unity is dying anyway.\nSucks that the only answer to this is to scrap developer edition and install the beta ppa (which has the Unity integration, of course) but that's all I've got.\n", "Q: Unable to log into my desktop with correct password I'm unable to log into my desktop for ubuntu.\nWhen I'm in my BIOS, it says Ubuntu is installed on my 500 GB SSD when it's installed on my 250 GB SSD.\nWhen I do fdisk -l it shows that my partitions are on /dev/sdb for Ubuntu and /dev/sda for Windows.\nI'm not able to login to my desktop with the correct password, or use Guest Session.

I tried to delete /home/.local/share/tomboy after removing tomboy in the package manager, but it doesn't seem to reset everything. Anyone know how I can reinstall tomboy to its factory original state?\nThanks\n\nA: Running sudo apt-get purge tomboy will \"purge\" the package, meaning it will remove it and all of its associated files.

You can only run commands as root using sudo. \nThis is because as root, every little mistake in a command you type or every malicious executable you run can mess up your entire system. \nThere's the principle to always run everything with the least privileges needed to complete the task to prevent escalation. \nStop using the interactive root shell and place sudo in front of every command that really needs elevated privilege.

I thought it was a graphics driver problem, as I am running an AMD R9 380x card which was supposed to be fully supported by the open-source AMDGPU driver preinstalled with 16.04, but after looking around online, many people seem to have issues with. I thought the answer would be to install the recently released AMDGPU-Pro driver  here, following the instructions from here. However, when I reboot I am getting a black screen. Is there an easy way to revert my changes back? My machine was semi-functional with the freezing issue but now with no video at all is useless to me. How to proceed?\n\nA: When your system is booted and you're at the black screen issue the following keyboard command: CTRL-ALT-F2. Login with your account. Then, run the command:\namdgpu-pro-uninstall\n\nThis should uninstall the driver and hopefully get you back working again.\n\nA: *\n\n*Power off your system.\n\n*Power on the system, at the same time press on Shift key.\n\n*Select advanced recovery option & enter your password\n\n*Then type the command:\nmount -o remount, rw /    \n\nThis will give read write permission.\n\n*Run command:\namdgpu-pro-uninstall    \n\nThis will uninstall amdgpu-pro from your system.\n\n*To shutdown system, run command: poweroff & then power on the system.\n\nA: For me fixed by entering command line with CTRL+F1 then removing the drivers \namdgpu-pro-uninstall\n\nand reinstall using the --px option\n./amdgpu-pro-install --px\n\n\nA: Press keyboard command: CTRL-ALT-F2 and Login with your account. Then, run the command:\namdgpu-pro-uninstall\nsudo apt purge amdgpu*\n\nEven after uninstalling amdgpu pro driver I still got black screen (even i executed the command X -configure), so I go to root shell by the option in recovery mode and removed the remaining driver.

(Basically just disable safe boot and fast boot, change from RAID to AHCI in BIOS, then install Ubuntu and make sure graphics and other drivers work). Everything works pretty well immediately after installation.\nI want to disable the \"TapAndDragGesture\" which is enabled by default in synaptics. But when I use synclient to do so: synclient TapAndDragGesture=0 the gesture does not completely go away. The behavior is that now, if I double tap, it will drag for a brief period of time (about half a second, as opposed to dragging for however long I keep my finger on the touchpad). \nThis is still very irritating as the amount of time it drags is still enough for me to accidentally move tabs around (as I tend to do when quickly tapping to switch tabs). \nHas anyone experienced this issue or something similar? And does anyone know how to fix it? Thanks in advance. \n\nA: I use the synclient MaxTapMove=0 to solve the problem. Although I am really not sure it is the right solution. \n\nA: I was able to resolve this issue by installing and using libinput instead of synaptics for my input driver. \nThis post describes the installation process very simply for 15.04+ (I am on 16.04). \nAfter following these steps, you can verify that your touchpad uses libinput: in the terminal type xinput list to get the device id of your touchpad, then:\nxinput list-props <device_id>\n\nMost of the properties in the list should have \"libinput\" as part of the name. \nFinally, to disable the \"Tap and Drag gesture\", simply edit the file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-libinput.conf. Find the section for the touchpad and disable the tapping drag option:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"libinput touchpad catchall\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Driver \"libinput\"\n    Option \"TappingDrag\" \"false\"\nEndSection\n\nThere are many other useful options that can be changed or tweaked, which is well documented here\nOnce the options are set, save the file, log out, log in, and enjoy!\n\nA: After trying everything above, synclient SingleTapTimeout=0 finally worked for me. If that doesn't work, I'd encourage you to just type synclient into the terminal and mess with some of the settings.

BUT, if you got none, you really have to make sure that your 32GB of RAM is enough for the summed up RAM consumption of all running processes. If you don't the kernel will kill processes at its own gusto.\nWhy are there two SWAP partitions?\nThis box is using a linux software raid with level 1. This means it mirrors the disks. Although you COULD theoretically destroy one of those SWAP partitions to use the disk space for something else (32GB should be enough) - I would strongly recommend against it.\nIf you would re-use sdb2 for example and if after some months or years of operation disk sda breaks, suddenly the amount of SWAP space will be 0.\nSo if now the RAM is fully used, linux will start to kill processes.\nTo sum this up: each disk in a raid 1 should provide everything that is necessary to operate the system on its own.\nWhat could you do to get more disk space?\nAside from getting a bigger server (the obvious way) you could rebuild the system and go without raid 1.\nBUT be absolutely sure, you create regular backups and you can restore the system with those. Additionally you should be comfortable with the circumstance, that a failed disk means a downtime of the whole system until the disk is replaced and the system is restored from backup. (Which could, depending on hardware services and your own reaction time and skill, last up to several days. - Well you should ALWAYS make sure, recent backups are at hand, just in case the system fails one day - and it WILL.)\nFurther Reads\nadditional information may be/is available at:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging#Linux\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#SWAP\n\n*http://makeuseof.com/tag/swap-partition\n", "Q: System language; does it limit app availability in the built-in Ubuntu app program?

It is a shortened version of the full path /home/$USER/Downloads/TEST ($USER is expanded to the name of the current user) because ~ is a shortcut for the home directory, in my case /home/zanna \nThe relative path, from ~/Documents would be\nrm ../Downloads/TEST\n\n.. specifies the parent directory of where you are now, and Downloads is a subdirectory of that directory. But you should be extra careful when using rm with relative paths, because it is easy to make a mistake and delete something you didn't intend to!\n\nA: Try this buddy : \nrm -f /absolutepath/file1.a /absolutepath/file2.b\n\nrm removes files, and -f forces it to (so that it wont stop, asking you if you want to delete the file). If this not in your home directory, prepend sudo.\nrm -rf  /absolutepath/emptyOrNotFolder\n\n\nA: Best way delete directory file is \" sudo rm -R ./file name \" . first you check ls then you see delete files name then write file name and delet any directory file. \n", "Q: Is that good to have both SDD point to root My ubuntu:\n ~# sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL\n NAME    FSTYPE              SIZE MOUNTPOINT LABEL\n sda                       223.6G\n |-sda1  linux_raid_member   953M            NC-PH-0456-19:0\n | `-md0 ext4                953M /boot\n |-sda2  linux_raid_member    32G            NC-PH-0456-19:1\n | `-md1 swap                 32G [SWAP]\n `-sda3  linux_raid_member 190.7G            NC-PH-0456-19:2\n   `-md2 ext4              190.7G /\n sdb                       223.6G\n |-sdb1  linux_raid_member   953M            NC-PH-0456-19:0\n | `-md0 ext4                953M /boot\n |-sdb2  linux_raid_member    32G            NC-PH-0456-19:1\n | `-md1 swap                 32G [SWAP]\n `-sdb3  linux_raid_member 190.7G            NC-PH-0456-19:2\n   `-md2 ext4              190.7G /\n\nOur websites is store in /var/www while backups go to /var/backups.

This allows the system to work even if one of the discs fails. It is not a backup, though.

My laptop came with 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) LTS.  Since then, I have made no significant changes, and I have been applying updates whenever I was notified of them.\nOn 2016-07-15, I was applying updates as normal, or so I thought.  The \"Software Updater\" pop-up window had got as far as \"Configuring shim-signed\", when I got this \"Debconf\" pop-up:\n\nAs you can see it:\n\n\n*\n\n*says \"Configuring Secure Boot\" in large lettering\n\n*has a \"Disable UEFI Secure Boot?\" tick-box (check-box)\n\n*has a \"Help\" button\n\n*has a \"Forward\" button\n\n\nI have never seen this before.  I clicked on the \"Help\" button prior to taking the screenshot, which brought up the 3rd pop-up that you can see.\nHelp pop-up text\nJust in case anyone searches by any of these phrases ...\nYour system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled. UEFI Secure Boot is not compatible with the use of third-party drivers.\n\nThe system will assist you in disabling UEFI Secure Boot. To ensure that this change is being made by you as an authorized user, and not by an attacker, you must choose a password now and then use the same password after reboot to confirm the change.\n\nIf you choose to proceed but do not confirm the password upon reboot, Ubuntu will still be able to boot on your system but these third-party drivers will not be available for your hardware.\n\nSubsequent Steps\nIf I remember correctly, ...\n\n\n*\n\n*After a while I agreed to \"Disable UEFI Secure Boot\", and clicked the \"Forward\" button.\n\n*This took me directly to a window where I set up a password (entering it twice).\n\n*The update process finished in the normal manner, with a pop-up asking me when to restart.\n\n*I restarted soon after.\n\n*During the boot process, there was a blue screen saying something like \"press any key to configure mok\".\n\n*I pressed a key.\n\n*Instead of being asked to provide the password I had set up 5 minutes earlier, as I had been expecting, the laptop just quickly booted up in the normal way.\n\n*I logged in to Ubuntu as normal.\n\n*The Wi-Fi adapter wasnât working.\n\n*I couldn't start VirtualBox VMs.  The error was \"Kernel driver not installed\".\n\n*Various other problems.\n\n*I tried restarting again, more than once, but I never saw that blue \"configure mok\" screen again.\n\n*I noted that my current kernel was 3.19.0-65\n\n*So I restarted and used grub to select 3.19.0-64\n\n*Everything was working fine again.\nMy Research Notes\nNote01 - I looked in my BIOS settings (for the first time on this laptop).  Secure Boot appears to be enabled.  If \"Debconf\" had been successful in disabling UEFI Secure Boot, would that have been reflected in the BIOS settings?\nNote02 - My laptop is a Dell XPS 13, and other people are reporting problems with 3.19.0-65 on Dell hardware.\nNote03 - The update instructions for USN-3037-1 say to upgrade to 3.19.0-65.  The final paragraph is:   \n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\n  been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\n  reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\n  Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n  (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\n  linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\n  this as well.\n\n(I am just a user and I don't really understand this.  Don't we always get a new version number? And don't we always have to recompile & reinstall - a process managed by DKMS or something?)\nNote04 - The changelog for 3.19.0-65.73 has lots of UEFI issues, including changes affecting EFI_SECURE_BOOT_SIG_ENFORCE and CONFIG_EFI_SECURE_BOOT_SIG_ENFORCE\nNote05 - Because my kernel version is 3.19, I assume I must be on the trusty linux-lts-vivid LTS enablement stack (??), as per the table here, where 3.19.0-65.73 is currently the latest entry.\nNote06 - It seems that someone who is on the trusty linux-lts-wily LTS enablement stack (kernel version 4.2) may have got the same pop-ups, the day before me, but without encountering any subsequent problems.\nNote07 - There is an answer from April 2016 which says:\n\nIn Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu starts to enforce secure boot to the kernel level. Before 16.04, Ubuntu does not really enforce you to use signed kernel and signed kernel modules, even you have secure boot turned on.\n\nCould it be that now, in July 2016, Ubuntu has introduced new Secure Boot requirements to 14.04 LTS?  If not, what is the problem I'm having with 3.19.0-65?  And either way, what should I (and the other people having problems) do about it?\nThanks!\n\nA: You are correct. The Canonical Kernel Team has enabled EFI_SECURE_BOOT_SIG_ENFORCE in the new 3.19 Ubuntu kernel.\nThat prevents from loading unsigned 3rd party kernel modules.\nIt looks like there is a script with GUI that is supposed to help to disable Secure Boot.\nIt did not work in your case. It depends on specific UEFI implementation in your computer.\nBut you can simply disable Secure Boot in your UEFI settings.\nSee this answer and comments below.\n\nA: You can also disable Secure Boot running sudo update-secureboot-policy. This wiki page explains this method.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu (GNOME) 16.10 use GNOME 3.22?

The intended way of destination was /usr/share/nginx/html, however in the file name there is an additional line mentioning a different path -> /usr/share/nginx/mario/desktop/'. I have no idea what it means? \n\n\nA: The file is a symbolic link or symlink pointing to /usr/share/nginx/mario/desktop. It has no content of its own - just a name and location, and a location that it points to. This information is stored in the filesystem (in inode tables), rather than inside the file itself.\nIf you open a symlink, you will see the contents of the file* it points to (we say the program follows the symlink to the target it points to)\nAny program that reads files in this directory will also read the file pointed to by the symlink. This is often really helpful and space-saving, because multiple copies of the file don't have to exist if symlinks from other directories can point to them and programs and users can find what they need. \nHere /usr/share/nginx/mario/desktop/ is the 'real' directory pointed to by the symlink. If you copied a symlink, then it should be pointing to the same place it was before (it's just a text string so it will not be changed by copying) and the symlink is not broken now (because it's showing up turquoise and not red) so to investigate you should check the target directory /usr/share/nginx/mario/desktop and the original file /Users/ogorod/Desktop/f6c594012317.html \n*in Linux, everything is a file even if it's a directory ;)\n\nA: The file /usr/share/nginx/html/f6c594012317.html is not a real file but a symlink (symbolic link). \nThat means if you access this file, your access gets redirected to the link target. \nIn this case, the link target is the directory /usr/share/nginx/mario/desktop/, so the \"file\" will behave like a directory.\n", "Q: How do I know which programs use a particular file? I found a file called kernel-4.2.5 in my Home directory and I want to delete it but I don't know what harm that could cause. Is there a way of knowing if that file is being used because my kernel version is 4.4.0-31-generic.\nIn addition, how do I find out all the installed programs on my system that I no longer use?\n\nA: You can find out what software packages contain a specific file (or directory) using the command\ndpkg -S /PATH/TO/FILE_OR_DIRECTORY\n\nThis only works for installed packages and only for files/directories that are contained in the package. It does not recognize files/directories that were created by the installation scripts or later by the running application.\n\nTo find out whether a file is currently opened by any applications, you can use the command \nlsof /PATH/TO/FILE_OR_DIRECTORY\n\nNo output means that the file is currently not opened by anything. Otherwise you get one line per application that is currently using the file.\n\nIf both commands have no outputs and therefore suggest that the file is not needed, probably you can safely delete it. I can't guarantee that it is not needed for anything you might want any more, of course, but I think your chances are pretty good. \nIt can't really be a system-relevant file anyway as it is in your home directory, but no idea how it got there. \nThe safest thing is to move it anywhere as backup for another few months or so until you're really 100% sure you don't need it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu with tablet mode for Lenovo Yoga I have just bought Lenovo Yoga 500 with Windows 10.

A meta package does not include any real programs in it it is more of a recipe.  It directs the package manager to pull in all the needed programs for the desktop environment to  work fully and have all the features it should. It will pull in cinnamon and all the other files needed for a full Cinnamon Desktop install\nWithout it, just installing cinnamon would most likely get you a working desktop but features would be missing.  For example you could be missing the bluetooth manager for Cinnamon.  As some of this stuff would be installed in standard Ubuntu, you would likely have a functioning desktop but might have to do some stuff in terminal only because you are missign the graphical front-end in Cinnamon.  I will also make it much harder for you to get help because instruction for Cinnamon will not work because you are missing a program needed in the instructions.\nIn short you want to install the cinnamon-desktop-enviroment  to get the full desktop.  In doing so, however, you will have doubles of some programs.  Nautilus will still be installed but Cinnamons default Nemo will also be installed, so if you search for \"files\" you will come up with two programs with that name, you will need to search for Nemo.\n\nOne other word of warning, you may find it harder to get help here with Cinnamon installed, it is a minority DE so less people will be available to help you.

Everything will still work in Unity but the icon will be a mix of Unity's default and Gnome's default icons.  Ubuntu Gnome in a official flavor of Ubuntu so is supported on these forums.  As you have a fresh install you could just reinstall Ubuntu Gnome instead of installing ubuntu-gnome-desktop  but the result will be the same.\nThere is one bug with Ubuntu Gnome that affect Nautilus, it causes freezing in the menu. If you want to use Gnome, you could install another file manager, the closest would be Nemo(my preference, it's Nautilus with more features).  To do that there are a few step but they are easy, see  http://www.webupd8.org/2013/10/install-nemo-with-unity-patches-and.html for instructions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu (GNOME) 14.04 just updated, and now cannot login to X server I have just updated my Ubuntu gnome 14.04 and restarted the computer,\nNow the system does not load the X and gnome.

I've accidentally installed Ubuntu from a 16.10 iso image instead of 16.04 and I do not want to reinstall it via a format...\nIs there a way I can downgrade from 16.10 to 16.04?\nPS: \nI desire to have an LTS release as to guarantee a certain stability level, would downgrading to 16.04 be a waste of time since 16.10 would allow me such stability, or switching to 16.04 is the logical thing to do?\n\nA: There is no way to downgrade. You can install 16.04 from scratch.\n16.10 has not been released yet, and you can't expect stability from a development version.\nPlease also take in accont that questions about Ubuntu 16.10 are off-topic at this site till the end of October, when it is planned to be released.\n\nA: APT has a feature called pinning. If sources.list (or files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d) include repository entries for both xenial and yakkety, and file /etc/apt/preferences contains the following lines\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=yakkety,o=Ubuntu\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=xenial,o=Ubuntu\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\napt-get dist-upgrade should try to install package versions corresponding to xenial release (i.e. downgrade all packages). If the process is interrupted, dpkg --configure --pending may help a little bit.\nThis is something that is not supported, and should not be done without backups and means for reinstall available. If something does work as it should after this kind of downgrade, the general advise will probably be \"do a clean reinstall\".\n", "Q: The NTP \"ntpdc\" shell command \"peers\" returns \"localhost: timed out, nothing received\" I'm running Ubuntu MATE 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) - 64-bit \"Desktop\" version - in a HP laptop computer.\nI have a question regarding NTP (Network Time Protocol): if i run the command \"ntpq -p\", I then get the following results:\n$ ntpq -p\n     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter\n==============================================================================\n 0.ubuntu.pool.n .POOL.          16 p    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 1.ubuntu.pool.n .POOL.          16 p    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 2.ubuntu.pool.n .POOL.          16 p    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 3.ubuntu.pool.n .POOL.          16 p    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n ntp.ubuntu.com  .POOL.          16 p    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n-mirrors.dominio 195.220.94.163   3 u   43  256  377   15.209    0.548   0.786\n+ntp02.oal.ul.pt 194.117.9.138    2 u  194  256  377   10.934   -0.398   0.783\n+a88-157-128-22. 212.113.174.246  3 u    7  256  377    7.905   -0.105   0.156\n-smtp-in1.aqea.n 194.117.9.136    3 u  120  256  377   10.117    0.000   0.269\n*ns.rnl.tecnico. 131.188.3.222    2 u   56  256  377   11.111    0.135   9.384\n\nHowever, if I run the \"peers\" command in an \"ntpdc\" shell, I get an error message:\n$ ntpdc\nntpdc> peers\nlocalhost: timed out, nothing received\n***Request timed out\nntpdc> quit\n\nI haven't changed the NTP configuration file (/etc/ntp.conf) from its default configuration.

Personally, I prefer DownThemAll plug for Firefox.\n", "Q: What is the difference between locate/whereis/which What is the basic difference between locate whereis and which command. \nThe basic difference that I observed is that locate locates all the related file names in the entire filesystem, whereas whereis and which commands only give the location (system/local address of file) of installed application. How accurate is my observation?\nHow are these commands implemented internally. Why does locate work so fast as compared to the dash search, while locate has to search a particular filename matching the target string in the entire filesystem hierarchy?\n\nA: which finds the binary executable of the program (if it is in your PATH). man which explains more clearly:\n\nwhich returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be\n  executed in the current environment, had its arguments been given as  commands in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell.  It does this by searching the PATH for executable files matching the names of the  arguments. It does not follow symbolic links.\n\nwhereis finds the binary, the source, and the man page files for a program. For example\n$ whereis gimp\n/usr/bin/gimp /usr/lib/gimp /etc/gimp /usr/share/gimp /usr/share/man/man1/gimp.1.gz\n\nYou can get extra detail by passing the output of these commands as arguments to ls -l or file\n$ ls -l $(which gimp)\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Jun 30 19:59 /usr/bin/gimp -> gimp-2.8\n\n$ file $(which gimp)\n/usr/bin/gimp: symbolic link to gimp-2.8\n\nlocate indeed finds all the files that have the pattern specified anywhere in their paths. You can tell it to only find files and directories whose names (rather than full paths) include the pattern with the -b option, which is usually what you want, and gives a less unwieldy list.\nlocate is fast because it uses a binary database that gets periodically updated (once daily, by cron). You can update it yourself to ensure recently added files are found by running sudo updatedb\nOne more thing about locate - it doesn't care whether files still exist or not, so to avoid finding recently deleted files, use -e. Often I also pipe to less as the list can be long. Typically I do:\nsudo updatedb && locate -b -e gimp | less\n\nHow Unity's dash works is explained here - it uses Zeitgeist to index system files and learn from usage patterns, and enables other applications to make use of this data, so it is doing a lot more work than locate.\n\nA: Simply\n$ which samba\n\nwhich command searches the list of programs listed down through the PATH settings\n$ whereis samba\n\nwhereis command also searches for programs that are not present in the PATH setting\n$locate samba\n\nAlso finds files by filename but does not search the directory structure itself but only a database prepared by updatedb. Because of that locate is faster than find but less accurate. Examples:\n\nA: I would also suggest find to print all results\nfind . -type d -name gimp -print\n\nand if you decide to also remove use\nfind . -type d -name gimp -print -delete\n\nI hope it helps, anyone else looking for it\n", "Q: Disable Mouse Back button in Ubuntu Linux I am using Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bit) with my MS mouse.

Does anyone have any idea how to achieve this? Thanks!\n\nA: You can use chpasswd which reads a list of username/password combinations from STDIN and applies them.\nTo generate the input, we can make a list of all enabled user accounts that have a password set using passwd -Sa | grep -Po \"^\\S+(?= P)\". Then we append a colon \":\" and the new password after every username with the help of sed.\nThis construct would then look like that:\npasswd -Sa | grep -Po \"^\\S+(?= P)\" | sed \"s/$/:NEWPASSWORD/\" | chpasswd\n\nIt must be executed as root though, so we must either put it in a script and run that as root (with sudo), or we must run it in a Bash root shell by putting it inside sudo bash -c 'COMMAND'.\nHere is the full command you can run, replacing NEWPASSWORD with what you desire.\nsudo bash -c 'passwd -Sa | grep -Po \"^\\S+(?= P)\" | sed \"s/$/:NEWPASSWORD/\" | chpasswd'\n\n", "Q: Working with cronjobs, bashscripts to automate MySQL backups \n*\n\n*I am currently setting up a system which uses a MySQL database.\n\n*I want to create automated backups which run every evening at 10:00PM and also keep the backups for 30 days.\n\n\nI know there is a way using cronjob and a bashscript which is executed.\nI already configured a .my.cnf for my SQL user so I won't have to paste the password into the bashscript.\nAll the tutorials I find do have some extras which I don't need and currently I don't feel to confident to create a script myself.\nDo you have an idea or tutorial which is simple and easy?\n\nA: There is not really a need for a bash script.\nFirst, work out what backup command would work for you. In principle, you could do something as easy as:\nmysqldump > /path/to/mysqldump.sql 2>/path/to/mysqldump.err\n\nThis will write the contents of all the data bases to a file called mysqldump.sql. The form of this is such that, if you need to restore the data base after a disaster, all you need to do is mysql < /path/to/mysqldump.sql. Moreover, mysqldump preserves database integrity, i.e. it will produce a consistent copy of the database even if a transaction was going on at the time of the dump. If there is an error, it will be written to mysqldump.err.\nYou may need to investigate parameters such as -u, --login-path=local and --events. Also you may want to specify certain --databases to be backed up. For the sake of this discussion, I will not go into all that.\nWhen the mysqldump command works to your satisfaction, you will want to have it run automatically as a cron job. To run the dump at 22:00 daily, specify this in the cron tab: \n0 22 * * * mysqldump ... (etc)\nOf course, this will overwrite the dumped database daily. To keep 30 copies, you will want to use logrotate. In /etc/logrotate.d, create a new file called (let's say) mysqldump. In this file enter this:\n/path/to/mysqldump.sql {\n  su (your username)\n  rotate 30\n  daily\n  missingok\n  notifempty\n}\n\nSave the file and restart logrotate. \nLogrotate will visit your mysqldump directory daily and rename the newest one to mysqldump.sql.1, the newest-but-one to mysqldump.sql.2, and so on. If you have already 30 copies, it will delete the oldest.\nAs for tutorials, you don't really need one. Just read man mysqldump, man crontab and man logrotate. These are all very well understood tools that will simply work.\n", "Q: integrate wine menu bars with ubuntu I've seen that it is possible to integrate Java Swing menu bars with the Unity Panel here.\nIs there anyway to do the same with Windows applications running with Wine?\n\nA: This doesn't seem like it would be possible to me, the reason being that in Windows the menu bars are in the app window and cannot be integrated into the OS.

I decided I had to do a complete reinstall of my Ubuntu partition.\nHaving done this the nvidia drivers are now appearing in additional drivers. \ndrivers\nWhat does it mean that it is using the X.Org server? Does that mean it is not using the Nvidia GPU?\nUpdate: \nI tried\n\nsudo apt-get update \n  sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current nvidia-updates\n\nGot \"Unable to locate package nvidia-updates\" so did \n\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-current \n  sudo apt-get install nvidia-340 libcuda1-340\n\nBut when I reboot I just get a black screen.\nI've learned that if you do ctrl+alt+f1 at this point you get a terminal screen.\nI managed to get back to the gui by these commands from here.\n\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade \nsudo apt-get install build-essential \nsudo apt-get install linux-source \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade \nsudo reboot \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates \nsudo nvidia-xconfig \nsudo reboot\n\nBut they remove nvidia-340 and libcuda1-340.\nI tried again with \n\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-current \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340 libcuda1-340\n\nand\n\nsudo nvidia-xconfig \nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nBut this remains on the black screen.

Though there are still problems with cuda, but have asked another question for that here.\n\nA: According to www.geforce.com/drivers You should be using the following nvidia driver for your specific card. Run the following commands to install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-current nvidia-current-updates\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-340 libcuda1-340\n\nTo explain about the xorg driver: because you installed nvidia-current instead of nvidia-340 and because nvidia-340 wasn't installed, your system was using nouveau instead of the proprietary drivers. \nThe names are confusing (nvidia-current) but nvidia-340 is the one you need and you will receive current updates automatically for your nvidia driver along with the rest of your system software.\nReboot for the changes to take effect.\nAdditionally, these are the binary drivers so there is no need to download anything from the nvidia website, it's already installed.\n\nUPDATE\nAfter doing the above and after you reboot:\nTypically, you don't always have to run nvidia-xconfig but sometimes you do so sign into a tty (Press CTRL + ALT + F2 and sign in with your user name and password) and then run the following command:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nIf that doesn't work, reboot.\nIf that still doesn't work, run the command dmesg and look for anything relevant to the problem like a failed module or xorg.\nPlease post any errors, thanks.\n\nUPDATE-2\nFirst go into your BIOS settings and make sure the Nvidia card is enabled. Power on the laptop and quickly press F2 repeatedly until the BIOS settings screen opens.\nIf it is enabled, boot into ubuntu and run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get install libgles1-mesa libgles2-mesa libosmesa6 libva-drm1 libva-egl1 libva-glx1 libva-tpi1 libva-wayland1 libva-x11-1 vainfo libegl1-mesa libegl1-mesa-drivers libgbm1 libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx libglapi-mesa libwayland-egl1-mesa libxatracker2 libvdpau-va-gl1 libdrm-intel1 libdrm2 libva1 va-driver-all i965-va-driver intel-gpu-tools\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends nvidia-340\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nReboot.\nIf it starts in low graphics mode, press CTRL + ALT + F2 and sign in with your user name and password.\nThen, execute the following commands:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nIf that doesn't work, run the following command and please post the output:\nsudo modprobe nvidia\n\n\nUPDATE 3\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-source\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-headers-generic\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nsudo reboot\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340-updates\n\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Can't install PlayOnLinux The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n playonlinux : Depends: python-wxgtk2.8 but it is not installable or\n                        python-wxgtk3.0 but it is not installable\n               Depends: cabextract but it is not installable\n               Depends: icoutils but it is not installable\n               Depends: p7zip-full but it is not installable\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: Most likely the\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nwill fix the issue.

This is because Debian's\n# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,\n# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in\n# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as\n# possible.\n\n# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined\n# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:\n#\n#   /etc/apache2/\n#   |-- apache2.conf\n#   |   `--  ports.conf\n#   |-- mods-enabled\n#   |   |-- *.load\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   |-- conf-enabled\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   `-- sites-enabled\n#       `-- *.conf\n#\n#\n# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces\n#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the\n#   web server.\n#\n# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is\n#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be\n#   customized anytime.\n#\n# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/\n#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,\n#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,\n#   respectively.\n#\n#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their\n#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our\n#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See\n#   their respective man pages for detailed information.\n#\n# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in\n#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with\n#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not\n#   work with the default configuration.\n\n\n# Global configuration\n#\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# NOTE!

Situation: fix Out of Memory errors in Ubuntu's Matlab\nGoal: allocate some virtual memory and/or Swap on external HDD/SSD; the read/write decrease from 20 GBps to 0.1 GBps, which is ok!\nTerminology: swap and virtual memory here \n\nNo, swap and virtual memory are completely different. For example, memory mapping a 1GB file uses an additional 1GB of virtual memory but has no change in the use of swap. Swap is a form of backing store.

A slow but a permanent solution?\n\nA: OK, quite a list you have there. Let me respond inline\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Apply the Better Error-handling of Error trapping here? See my script for the example in the source. Thread How to Do Error-trapping and Swapoff if Error/Warning?.\n\n\nI don't like the concept of this script at all. That you have an external harddrive that you're trying to use as swap is just a bad idea. If you really intend to do this on a regular basis then resize your partitions to put a proper swap partition in, add a swap file, or just buy a bigger internal disk.\n\n\n*How to put warnings if the matrix size exceeds the swap size?\n\n\nJust do do the math. If you know the size of the matrix before the program begins then compute the size in MiB and compare it to the available swap.\n\n\n*How to have a progress bar in computing your huge matrix in Matlab?\n\n\nmatlab has an API right? I don't think this is the right forum for that question. Even if you had an API, you'll be blocking on IO via swap so it'll just be a jerky progress bar that doesn't actually reflect reality.\n\n\n*How to kill busy progress and/or swapon -s/swapoff in iteration (2)?\n\n\nYou don't. just because you're done with the computation doesn't mean the operating system is done with the resources you allocated. When it's done writing out to swap, it'll free up. You've consumed so much memory that lots of applications can't get the memory they need so they're using swap too. Just leave it on and let the operating system do it's thing. Before you perform your next run clear the caches.\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches \n\nThere's probably more to it than that, I'm not a Linux VM expert. It would be worthwhile to investigate how the SLAB/SLUB allocator works and how to tune it for your large memory requirements. You may be able to MLOCK matlab into memory. That forces the OS to reserve memory for you, or it just doesn't start, you also have to unlock it when you're done. I can do this with the C API just fine but I not sure how you would do that outside of a process I can't recompile, that would require some research.\nFinally, this is the sort of stuff EC2 was made for. It looks like 16G is what you need, a m4.4xlarge has 64G ram @ $0.958 per Hour. That's less than a cup coffee. Script your install of matlab using a juju charm or similar and turn the whole thing into a computation as a service.\nIs 16G 16 GB?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, normally when we leave off the suffix we mean base2 numbers in units of bytes. If you want to concise you would write 16GiB.\n\n\n\"I need matrices that are > 100 GB. I do not know if you can do it with EC2.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*EC2 has machines with up to 2TB main memory. See for yourself.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\nShould you clear your caches also by echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, it doesn't hurt to always do that. See Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt\nin the linux kernel.\n\n\nHow can you MLOCK Matlab into memory?\n\n\n*\n\n*man mlock. Though I goofed when I quoted that. This call assures that you can allocate all the memory you want and keep in from being swapped out, it'll never use virtual memory. That's not what you want.\n\n\nI think you can bind C API to Matlab. - - Do you have any idea of turning off swap if there is any failure in the processes?\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm going to be frank here, the concept of micromanaging swap files in the manner you propose is ridiculous. The operating system's job is to manage resources and hand them out in a fair & consistent manner. Once you give it more resources, it's going to use them as it sees fit. You don't get to tell it when you're done and yank resources out from underneath it, the OS tells you when it's done.\n\n\nWhen I ask the OS for an memory address space, sometimes it doesn't always succeed, that doesn't mean I can't try again. That matlab can't figure out to call malloc twice is matlab's problem.\nSo, to affect the change you want, if that 100G of space is really at a premium then you need to figure out how to tell the operating system to trim it's memory footprint (by clearing caches for starters) so the memory manager doesn't feel the need to use the additional swap space that it was provided. Then and only then can you ask the memory manager to release the swap file.\nIt's easy to grow things like memory and disks, it's a lot harder to shrink them. Shrinking forces a re-balancing of every user who has resources allocated in that space. If I instead said \"I have a 100TB storage array but now I only need 60TB, why is it when I remove 40TB of disk that the array stops working?\" Well, the answer would be obvious right?\nSo here are your options as I see it.\n\n\n*\n\n*investigate the matlab C API to see if you can get better control over how memory is allocated for these massive working sets.\n\n*refactor your computation to compute what you have now using sub-matrices or some other sparse data representation.\n\n*write your own program in C/C++ using the plethora of linear algebra libraries out there to perform the computation and use malloc or mmap anonymous to allocate the address space you need.\n\nA: Use zswap if you have swap portions on HDD/SSD. \nTho module zram is without swap portions on HDD/SSD, so Hakala's answer is not applicable. \nSee the thread zram vs zswap vs zcache Ultimate guide: when to use which one for explanations. \nSetup zswap as described in the thread How to Activate Zswap Successfully for Matlab Computation in Ubuntu 16.04?\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the corresponding line with the following line in /etc/default/grub\n# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zswap\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash zswap.enabled=1 zswap.max_pool_percent=25 zswap.compressor=lzo\"\n\n\n*Run sudo update-grub. \n\nA: You cannot dedicate swap for a software. What you can do is create a shell script that creates a swap, start MATLAB, and delete the swap when MATLAB exits.\nHere's an example script which creates a swap of 10Mb in the /tmp directory, mounts it, starts R (I don't have matlab), wait R exits, umount the swap file and delete it.\nPlease note that:\n- you will have a warning because the swap file is not owned by root. That's because the system will use if for any software, maybe not ran by you, and you can read on this file... I let you fix it.\n- if you [ctrl]-[c] the script, or logoff, or etc., the swap will remain mounted. I let you fix it as well.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nSWAP_FILE=/tmp/my_swap_file\nSIZE_MB=10\nTO_RUN=\"R\"\n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=${SWAP_FILE} bs=1M count=${SIZE_MB}\nmkswap ${SWAP_FILE}\nchmod 0600 ${SWAP_FILE}\nsudo swapon -v ${SWAP_FILE}\necho \"Swap enabled. Press enter to continue\"; read\n${TO_RUN}\necho \"I will remove the swap. Press enter to continue\"; read\nsudo swapoff -v ${SWAP_FILE}\nrm -vf ${SWAP_FILE}\n\n\nA: I would at least test how well compressed RAM (zram kernel module, available since kernel version 3.14) performs.\nFollowing archlinux wiki instructions\nmodprobe zram\necho lz4 > /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm\necho 4G > /sys/block/zram0/disksize\nmkswap --label zram0 /dev/zram0\nswapon --priority 100 /dev/zram0\n\nMy guess is that compressed RAM should be faster than disk I/O. \nTo keep the change also after the restart, place boot time commands in /etc/rc.local and run sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service. \n\nA: This is how you can expand your SWAP memory using an external hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, write down your actual SWAP memory by running:\nfree -m\n\n\n*Second, have at hand the folder of your HDD. It should be something like /media/myhdd.\n\n*Decide the size of extra SWAP you want to add. Let's say, X GB.\n\n*Calculate the amount of bytes that quantity is. Using GB, this is: Y=X*1024^3, where Y is the result of your calculation.\n\n*Choose the block size of the file (it is in bytes). Let's use the default here: 4096 (See more about this here).\n\n*Calculate the number of blocks the file will have: Z=Y/4096\n\n*Create a file of size X GB using the following command in a terminal:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/media/myhdd/swapfile bs=4096 count=Z\n\n\n*Create the SWAP in the file using:\nsudo mkswap /media/myhdd/swapfile -f\n\n\n*Finally, enable the SWAP:\nsudo swapon -p 1000 /media/myhdd/swapfile\n\nNow your SWAP has increased. Check again with free -m\n\nWe can set up this in a non-interactive script (sudo powers needed):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n### Inputs ###\n\nswap_GB=$(expr 1) # Enter here size of the swap memory to create, in GB.\nswap_bs=$(expr 4096) # Enter here block size, in bytes (must be a multiple of 8).\nHDD_folder=\"/media/myhdd/\" # Enter absolute path of HDD inside the brackets.\n\n### Swap creation ###\n\nswap_size=$(expr $swap_GB \\* 1024 \\* 1024 \\* 1024 / $swap_bs)\ndd if=/dev/zero of=${HDD_folder}\"/swapfile\" bs=$swap_bs count=$swap_size\nmkswap ${HDD_folder}\"/swapfile\" -f\nswapon -p 1000 ${HDD_folder}\"/swapfile\"\n\n### EOF ###\n\nPS: please optimize/correct if possible.

downloading IE 11 to see if it'll work with Steam. Will post results as soon as I get them.\n\nA: If you run the windows version of steam on wine, you also need to make sure all dependencies are available. For example: steam for windows uses a browser as backend for its store and community. Not sure if it is Internet Explorer, but give it a try please. And if that does not work, install firefox and/or google chrome for windows under the wine, as well.\nEdit\nFor videos to play, you most probably also need the adobe flash player for the browser that is used by steam.\n\nA: The workaround I use is to install the Linux version of Steam.  The store works there, you can buy the Windows games, then start the Wine-Steam and play them.\n", "Q: boot full half installed kernals I've only had Ubuntu for a couple of months so please be gentle as I'm a complete noob here. I'm getting the boot full warning that seems to have plagued many on here, but none of the answers seem to work. I have tried removing old kernels from the terminal and with synaptic. It seems as though many are half installed, but they cannot be repaired as there is no room; bit of a vicious circle. I hope this makes sense to someone.\nPlease help,\nMatt\nmitchell@mitchell-Inspiron-530:~$ sudo apt-get install -f\nReading package lists... Done\nReading state information...

I'm only granting permission to all to do anything but why does the system crash by giving permissions only? I'm only modifying the permission not changing the files.\n\nA: A short answer.\nLinux system requires specific permissions for certain programs like sudo, etc.\nWhen you run chmod 777 -R / you wipe all permissions and replace them with 777. This makes the system unusable unless you manually restore all the permissions.\nIn practice it is much faster and easier to re-install.\nThe problem is that many system programs are designed a way that they do not start if they \"do not like\" the permissions. This is made for security reasons.\nI think it is more important to explain how to handle the system design in paractice than to explain why each program fails to work with wrong permissons.\nIf you really want all users to have unlimited permissions in Ubuntu, you can add all users to the sudo group instead of changing file and directory permissions. That will have the same effect, but will not ruin the system.\nAnother way (a very bad one) is to activate root account and allow everyone to login as root.\n\nA: chmod has subtle nuances.\nchmod 0777 behaves differently from chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx in that the setuid and setgid are zeroed by the first and preserved by the latter.\nThat is why the system became unusable.  You removed necessary setuid from a few programs.\nHere is a list of setuid or setgid files on my Linux Fedora 23 laptop:\n[root@fedora23lnvr61]# find / -perm /g+s,u+s\n/var/log/journal\n/var/log/journal/75e870eb13c74fbf97556a32ecf80ea2\n/opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox\n/usr/bin/rogue\n/usr/bin/gnuchess\n/usr/bin/locate\n/usr/bin/umount\n/usr/bin/lbrickbuster2\n/usr/bin/gpasswd\n/usr/bin/crontab\n/usr/bin/fusermount\n/usr/bin/su\n/usr/bin/at\n/usr/bin/newuidmap\n/usr/bin/sudo\n/usr/bin/pkexec\n/usr/bin/mount\n/usr/bin/chsh\n/usr/bin/newgrp\n/usr/bin/passwd\n/usr/bin/chage\n/usr/bin/chfn\n/usr/bin/write\n/usr/bin/newgidmap\n/usr/sbin/mount.nfs\n/usr/sbin/lockdev\n/usr/sbin/netreport\n/usr/sbin/userhelper\n/usr/sbin/usernetctl\n/usr/sbin/unix_chkpwd\n/usr/sbin/pam_timestamp_check\n/usr/libexec/kde4/kdesud\n/usr/libexec/kde4/kpac_dhcp_helper\n/usr/libexec/dbus-1/dbus-daemon-launch-helper\n/usr/libexec/qemu-bridge-helper\n/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign\n/usr/libexec/spice-gtk-x86_64/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper\n/usr/libexec/utempter/utempter\n/usr/libexec/abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache\n/usr/libexec/Xorg.wrap\n/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1\n/usr/lib64/vte-2.90/gnome-pty-helper\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VBoxSDL\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VirtualBox\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VBoxNetNAT\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VBoxHeadless\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VBoxNetDHCP\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VBoxNetAdpCtl\n/usr/lib64/virtualbox/VBoxVolInfo\n/usr/lib64/vte/gnome-pty-helper\n[root@fedora23lnvr61]# \n\nI removed dozens of noise entries in caches and logs.\n\nA: Additional to the other replies: you also removed the \"sticky bit\" from /tmp (which usually has permissions 1777), and this could cause other unexpected problems, as programs would be able to write to or delete each-others' temporary files.\nThe sticky bit is a special permission which, whilst allowing anyone to create files in /tmp, only allows the person who created it to move or remove it.\n\nA: There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst in addition to the usual read/write/execute permissions there are some other bits that file permissions contain. Most notably setuid and setgid. When a program with one of these permission bits is set is run it gets the \"effective UID\" and/or \"effective GID\" of the program's owner rather than the user that ran it. This allows programs to run with more permissions than the user that ran them.  It is used by many crucial system utilities including su and sudo. Your chmod command clears these bits leaving the utilities unusable.\nSecondly some programs (notably ssh) do a sanity check on file permissions and refuse to use files with permissions they see as insecure. This reduces the risk of careless admins accidentally leaving security holes but it makes dealing with wiped-out file permissions all the more painful. \n", "Q: Install error for Mysql-Server I try to install mysql-server and phpMyAdmin, after first instalation i have an error for log with user root ...and after this, error #2002 - No such file or directory. Ok, I tried to uninstall mysql-and reinstall. I successfully removed mysql (I think...hope), but now, when i try to install i have this error:\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n mysql-server-5.7\n mysql-server\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nHow can solve that?\nI searched for this error over 12 hours and don't find a proper solution.\nThank you for help !\n\nA: There is most likely a problem database in your /var/lib/mysql.  You can perform these steps to ensure you are performing a clean install.  After a successful clean install you can systematically bring in your previous databases or configurations.\nFirst clean the failed install with:\n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-*\n\nthen remove or rename the configuration directory and mysql database directory.  Since your mysql database directory may contain previous databases that you don't want to lose, rename it (this is the /var/lib/mysql folder).\nPerform these steps:\nfrom the directory /etc execute:\n$ sudo mv mysql mysql.old\n\nfrom the /var/lib directory (this is your database directory) execute:\n$ sudo mv mysql mysql.old\n\nNow perform your normal mysql install:\n$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nIf you had databases in your previous /var/lib/mysql directory you can use the following to get them back.  After bringing them back you can perform regular commands to rebuild/check the tables:\n$ sudo service mysql stop\n$ sudo mv mysql mysql.new\n$ sudo mv mysql.old mysql\n$ sudo service mysql start\n\n", "Q: How to install Unison 2.40 on Ubuntu 16.04 xenial (to resolve \"Fatal error: Received unexpected header\") On my other computers I have unison version 2.40.102 (this is the latest version available), and on my desktop ubuntu 16.04 xenial I have unison version 2.48.3.\nWhen trying to synchronize:\nkayd@Trunk:~$ unison . ssh://pi@mizu/.\n...\nFatal error: Received unexpected header from the server:\n expected \"Unison 2.48\\n\" but received \"Unison 2.40\\n\\000\\000\\000\\000\\017\", \nwhich differs at \"Unison 2.40\".\n\nVarious sources tell me to install unison-all, which I did, but it contains only version 2.48:\nkayd@Trunk:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/unison*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      24 Mai 20 22:15 /usr/bin/unison -> /etc/alternatives/unison\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      13 MÃ¤r 18 16:10 /usr/bin/unison-2.48 -> unison-2.48.3\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2169968 MÃ¤r 18 16:10 /usr/bin/unison-2.48.3\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      13 MÃ¤r 18 16:10 /usr/bin/unison-latest-stable -> unison-2.48.3\n\nThe my question is:\nHow can I install version 2.40 on xenial?\n\nA: I found a deb file here, which is for trusty, but aparently works anyway, downloaded the 64 bit version and used\nsudo dpkg --install ./unison-gtk_2.40.102-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nto install. Based on ridgy's answer I use unison-2.40-gtk to invoke unison for synching with my RaspberryPis\n\nA: Yeah, the versions of Unison that you are running have to be identical. This is because the format for the archive file that Unison uses to keep track of stuff is improved changed in each new version. \nIf you really want to install 2.40 on Xenial, just download the source for Unison, compile it with OCaml, and install it.\nAlthough, I would recommend installing a newer version of Unison on your other computer.\n\nA: Today I had the same problem: Server with raspbian (unison 2.40) and two clients (Ubuntu 14.04 / unison 2.40 and Ubuntu 16.04 / unison 2.48).\nBecause of raspbian, I could not (easily) upgrade to 2.48 on server. But copying the 2.40-binaries from Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu 16.04 did work:\nubu1604# cd /usr/bin; sudo scp -p ubu1404:/usr/bin/unison-2.40.102* .\n\nYou may then call unison-2.40.102 direct, or change the links /etc/alternatives/unison* to the respective binaries.\nEdit:\nAfter upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 on my second machine I again had the issue, and getting and installing the .deb file helped, thanks to kay_D.\nChanging only the links in /etc/alternatives did not be sufficient, as the repective .desktop file called the unison binary directly. So I changed /usr/share/applications/unison-gtk.desktop \nExec=unison-gtk\n\n(Sometimes i prefer to call programs not from a terminal, but from the menu)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch change system settings from command line (silent mode specifically)? I'm looking for a way to automatically set my Ubuntu Phone to silent mode during the night and automatically turn off silent mode in the morning (I keep forgetting to turn it off myself). I figure this could be done through some kind of cron job but in order to do that I need some way of changing the phones system settings from the command line and I can't figure it out. \nBoth gsettings and dconf seem to have silent-mode related settings but the value of these settings doesn't seem to be related at all to the real settings. Changing the settings using gsettings/dconf isn't reflected in the system settings and changing it in system settings isn't reflected in gsettings/dconf. So I'm looking for a way to change system settings from command line.\nThanks\n\nA: It seems to work (with OTA-11, connect with SSH):\namixer -q -D pulse sset Master toggle\n\nEdit: From https://askubuntu.com/a/444183\n\nA: Solution(ish)\nApparently dbus is a thing that could be used to change settings. The short version is that the following python script, when ran as root, turns off silent mode:\nimport dbus\n\nsession = dbus.SystemBus()\nproxy = session.get_object('org.freedesktop.Accounts','/org/freedesktop/Accounts/User#####')\ninterface = dbus.Interface(proxy,'org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties')\ninterface.Set('com.ubuntu.touch.AccountsService.Sound','SilentMode',False)\n\nThe slightly longer version is:\nqdbus --system\n\nSeems to list all the services associated with the system dbus.\nqdbus --system org.freedesktop.Accounts\n\nSeems to list the paths associated with that service.\nqdbus --system org.freedesktop.Accounts /org/freedesktop/Accounts/User#####\n\nSeems to list all the methods and properties associated with that path (in this case a path to a specific user). This had the following relevant methods:\nmethod QDBusVariant org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get(QString interface_name, QString property_name)    \nmethod QVariantMap org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll(QString interface_name)\nmethod void org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set(QString interface_name, QString property_name, QDBusVariant value)\nmethod QString org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect()\n\nHere the GetAll and Set methods require an interface name which we can find out by calling the Introspect function like this:\nqdbus --system org.freedesktop.Accounts /org/freedesktop/Accounts/User##### org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect\n\nWhich prints a xml-like document to the screen showing the interface definitions. Getting the silent mode value is done as follows:\nqdbus --system org.freedesktop.Accounts /org/freedesktop/Accounts/User##### org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get com.ubuntu.touch.AccountsService.Sound SilentMode\n\nThe problem now was that I couldn't figure out how to format it so qdbus interprets an argument as a boolean value, which is why I ended up using python as a workaround.\n", "Q: Bash script automation issue I'm taking this out of context but this bit of my script doesn't execute properly:\nlatest=$(ls ~/Videos/ -t | head -n 1 | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g')\nmpv ~/Videos/$latest\n\nI'm trying to automatically play the latest file added to my Videos directory. The following error occurs:\nError parsing option t (option not found)\nSetting command line option '--t=' failed.\n\nExiting... (Fatal error)\n\n\nA: Parsing the output of ls is generally a bad idea. Doing so when that output is a list of video files is an absolutely horrible idea. Video files will almost certainly contain spaces and other strange characters which are very likely to cause problems. Here's a safer alternative that does the same thing:\nlatest=\"$(stat --printf '%Y\\t%n\\0' * | sort -zk1 | tail -zn1 | cut -f2-)\"\nmpv \"$latest\"\n\nOr, if your tail doesn't have the -z flag:\nlatest=\"$(stat --printf '%Y\\t%n\\0' * | sort -rzk1 | awk -F'\\t' -vRS='\\0' '{print $2; exit}'\n\nOr\nlatest=\"$(stat --printf '%Y\\t%n\\0' * | sort -rzk1 | perl -00pe 's/^\\d+\\s+(.*?)\\0.*/$1/s')\"\n\nNote the quoting. You should always quote your variables unless you are absolutely certain that quoting will break something. This solution uses stat to print the modification date of the file (%Y), a tab (\\t), the file's name (%n) and a NULL character (\\0). This is fed to sort which sorts on the 1st field (-k1), the date and expects null-separated input (-z). It is then passed through tail to get the last (-n1) null-separated (-z) line and, finally, cut removes the date leaving only the file name. This ensures that you can deal with arbitrary files, even any with newlines in their names. \n\nThe error you are seeing is hard to diagnose without knowing the names of the files in ~/Videos. The main issue is that you're not quoting the variable's name, and since there seems to be a file with --t, that is taken as an argument. If you know your file names will never contain newlines, you could also do:\nlatest=\"$(ls ~/Videos/ -t | head -n 1)\"\nmpv ~/Videos/\"$latest\"\n\nBut this is really a bad habit to get into and should never be used in production code. \n", "Q: Can't extract files This error comes up when I try to extract the file or use it:\n\nAny idea why?\n\nA: You should try to download the file again.

How can I make it so that Windows is at the top?\n\nA: The easiest way to customize the entries in GRUB's boot menu is to use the tool grub-customizer.\nInstall it using these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nThen you can run grub-customizer.

I am in the process of upgrading the server and was wondering about the best way to layout file systems. I was looking at moving to ZFS pools but I wasn't sure that was ideal. \nThe current machine has media spread across a number of discs. 4x8TB Seagate 5400rpm archive drives and 4x4TB drives (a few different types).\nCurrently they are all mounted as separate file systems and half are used for backing up to the other half via an rsync script I cobbled together. \nOne draw back of the current setup is that I need to do a series of mount points for the media, a movies drives, music drive, and Running TV Series and Finished TV series. In particular I would like to consolidate all the TV together but there is more than 8TB of that currently. \nThe current setup is functional but some sort of more consolidated setup that arranged all of it as one giant \"media\" drive seems an attractive alternative. \nThe current mirroring arrangement is desirable to keep in some form and ability to survive a drive failure matters far more than performance. \nI would also really like the ability to add new drives to the set up without needing to copy everything off and copy everything back onto a setup. \nThe new system will be built around an i5 processor and 16GB of RAM. \nZFS looked like it might do the job well. The idea being to build two pools in a mirror setup (RAID-Z if I follow the terminology correctly). The difficulty of any setup here is that I have the mirrors currently but can't repurpose all the drives at once as the data needs to be moved to the new pool in stages. One of the other RAID settings would would if I can extend the pool 1 disc at a time as I copy the data from outside the pool into it and then add the copied disc as a new drive into the pool. \nIs there something related to ZFS that makes it wildly unsuitable for the task?\nDo people have any suggestions how they would approach such a set up? \nAm I better off sticking with the current setup? \n\nA: I'm currently using ZFS for this use case (i.e. media center storage). I've used it for several years now.\nYou can indeed configure your ZFS as a mirror:\n\n\n*\n\n*Data are copied amongst all disks in the mirror\n\n*The available size is the size of your smallest disk\n\n*So you can mimic an usual RAID mirroring by creating a zpool with X mirrors, each one containing 2 disks.\n\n\nOr as RAID-Z 1/2/3:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can loose 1, 2 or 3 disk depending on the type of the RAID-Z\n\n*The RAID-Z size is limited by the smaller disk, so having 4x4TB and 4x8TB is equivalent to having 8x4TB if all configured on the same grape. So, in your case, it's recommended to create 2 different raid-z of 4 disks each in the same pool.\n\n\nAlso, ZFS does not support yet adding a disk to an existing RAID-Z. So if you create a RAID-Z of 4 disks, it would never be able to contain more than 4 disks (but you can upgrade each disk to larger ones for example).\nIt's also important to know that it requires a lot of CPU/RAM for read/write operations. ZFS is configured by default to be able to use all your free RAM minus 1GB.\nFor more details, this document describes how ZFS works, and compares it with usual RAID.\nNB: If you intend to use ZFS, be sure to create your zpool with ashift=12 option like this:\nzpool create -o ashift=12 ...\n\nThis sets the sector size to 4096B instead of the default 512B. It will greatly improve your performances for your use case.\n", "Q: software center wont open due to killall gnome-software I just downloaded Ubuntu 16.04 and went to the software center to install Audacity.

How to manage this problem?\n\nA: You should handle these kind of issues with logrotate, it is designed for these tasks specifically.\nFor example, to enable logrotate to rotate the file /var/mail/root if the size of the file becomes 10 MB, you can add a logrotate configuration file e.g. /etc/logrotate.d/mailroot with the content:\n/var/mail/root {\n        # Rotate if the size is >=10MB:\n        size 10M  \n\n        # Keep 5 rotated logs:\n        rotate 5\n\n        # Do not rotate if empty:\n        notifempty \n\n        # Compresses rotated logs, default:\n        compress  \n}\n\nYou can define for the whole directory too using wildcard, *, so that it will be applicable to all files under it:\n/var/mail/* {\n\n....\n\n}\n\nAs logrotate is run daily by cron (anacron), you do not need to add any cron entry if the configuration is put in /etc/logroate.conf or /etc/logroate.d/*. You can also define your own crontab entry if the configuration file resides elsewhere, you might also need a state file that will contain the current file rotation tatus.\nMost importantly, check man logroate and man 5 logroate.conf to get more idea and options.\n", "Q: installing xubuntu on eee pc 900a using unetbootin I am attempting to install xubuntu on my eee pc 900a using unetbootin. after making sure the boot sequence is right and save & exit i get a blue screen with the header \"unetbootin and in the box \"default\". and reading \"press tab or automatic boot will start\" with a countdown. but once it reaches 1 it starts the count all over again. like in a loop. what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: If you are making bootable USB using windows, try using Universal USB Installer.

From there, start up Disk Management. From there, just wipe your Ubuntu-partitions, and later resize your Windows-partitions over the free space you will gain.\nNext, you need Windows to overwrite the boot, since you don't need GRUB anymore.

For example, to print copyright sign do\n$ printf \"\\u00a9\"                                                              \nÂ©\n$ echo -e \"\\u00a9\"                                                              \nÂ©\n\nPython can do the same, except you need to prepend u in the beginning of hexadecimal string.

I have found no way to disable that, \nbut I didn't see that as a big problem (actually: it was quite nice: the icons were always visible).\nBut: I am using a laptop. When the laptop is the in the docking station, I am only using two external monitors; I normally keep the lid of my laptop closed.\nNow my problem: since lately ... the system tray icons are no longer shown on my external monitors. When I open up the lid of my laptop, the icons\nare still there, in the middle of the \"top bar\"; but they don't show up on my external monitors.\nIn order to fix this problem:\na) I ran sudo apt-get --purge remove indicator-systemtray-unity  ... and re-installed\nb) I tried clicking on the little button, but no matter what; any left/right click just pops up a \"Settings\" dropdown, which pops up another dropdown (\"Backgrounds\"); and making\nchanges there doesn't seem to have any effect.\nSo, long story short, is there a way to reliable \"reset\" the indicator, so that it only shows the icons when I click the indicator?\nBtw, I am running 16.04; but I encountered similar issues before, when running the indicator on 14.04.\n\nA: Not a complete answer yet; but somehow a workaround, although not a real good one: I found that when I use the \"Display\" settings and first disable my two external monitors, and then re-enable them ... one of the external monitors will have the \"icon section\" in the top bar. But unfortunately this doesn't survive a reboot.\nToday, the owner (?) of the tool came back on my email that I send to him prior asking this question.\nTurns out, the answer is super easy, so according to ÐÐ»ÐµÐ± ÐÐ¾Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐµÐ²\nUse the \"floating mode\": press the middle mouse button on the indicator.\nor in terminal:\ngsettings set net.launchpad.indicator.systemtray tray-is-static false\n\nI pressed the middle mouse button on the indicator \"dropwdown\" button; and yes, the icons in the middle of the bar disappear!\n", "Q: Set up Kiosk in Ubuntu I received call one of a company. They are implementing and installing Ubuntu Desktop OS in there client systems and they need: \n\nCreate one user as a temporary user and that user should have 3 options enabled in client system: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*google chrome with one fixed URL(http:192.168.1.1) \n  \n*printer access for printing \n  \n*scanner access for upload docs. \n  \n  \n  All remaining functionality should be disabled. \n\nFor the above process, what resources do we have to use and how can we disable everything? The Company is asking to make a professional document for the above installation. Please help me with this issue.\n\nA: Question seems to be related to creating a Kiosk Mode Ubuntu session. If this is the case, you have several options. \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: you have two options here. First, you can just install a light version of Ubuntu and customize it such as it becomes a kiosk. Or you can start from a full ubuntu desktop and customize it to become a kiosk. Naturally, the former is better in terms of resource use. There are plenty of guides online, so it would be a bit redundant to write all the steps here. This guide is an example (for 14.04, but it should work for 16.04 too). \n\n*Purpose built kiosk OS: there are a several options around of open-source OS that are basically just a Kiosk mode. As such, they are very light in resources requirements. A few examples: Porteus Kiosk, Symphony OS and Instant WebKiosk.\n", "Q: Are manually installed dependencies better than auto installed ones? There is a VERY good question and answer here:  Should I use tasksel, tasks in APT or install regular metapackages? (which incidentally I got to from here: What's the easiest way to set up a LAMP stack?)\nMy problem is I just don't quite understand the (accepted and only and GOOD) answer and would like clarification. Specifically with regards to the final three points:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Will install the metapackage kubuntu-desktop. Dependencies are \"auto installed\".\n  \n  \n*sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop^\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Will select all packages tagged with task \"kubuntu-desktop\". That are all dependencies of metapackage kubuntu-desktop. They all are marked as \"manually installed\".\n  \n  \n*sudo tasksel install kubuntu-desktop\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure X is installed before installing packages of task.\n  Will install the metapackage kubuntu-desktop. Dependencies are \"auto installed\".\n  \n  \n\nMy question has nothing to do with kubuntu-desktop in actual fact I'm looking at lamp-server but don't think it is overly relevant (but clarified just in case). \nMy initial understanding of the above blockquote is that by having each individual package labelled as \"manually installed\" would be more desirable since you wouldn't lose \"auto installed\" dependant packages if you uninstalled/removed something and didn't specifically want to remove the dependencies, but on the other hand could leave \"clumps\" of packages around if you did manually uninstall after having used option 2. \nQuestion: Am I correct in that assumption? (removing individual components after a tasksel through apt-get would leave dependencies behind even after an autoremove)\nAnd even after reading the answer MANY times, I'm still not clear on what the better solution is.\n\nA: The factual part of your understanding is correct: manually installed packages are not removed during the \"autoremove\" operation if there is no reverse-dependency left on the system whereas automatically installed ones will be removed in that case.\nHowever you're wrong in that one is generally better than the other. What's better for you depends on your needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install the Kubuntu desktop via the task kubuntu-desktop^ and then decide that you don't want to keep the text editor Kate (package kate) around and remove it for some reason, a later \"autoremove\" command will not remove the rest of the Kubuntu desktop packages.\n\n*If you want try out the Kubuntu desktop (e. g. in addition to your current desktop environment) and install the meta-package kubuntu-desktop and then decide that you don't want to keep using it, you can remove the kubuntu-desktop package and run \"autoremove\" to get rid of all Kubuntu-specific packages at the same time.\n", "Q: How to use the free space after narrow /home partition in Ubuntu 14.04 I want to install windows7 with my current system ubuntu,and the first step I should do is to allocate a partition for win7.So I decided to narrow my /home patition.Therefore,I execute the following command line\numount /home\ne2fsck -f /dev/sda3\nresize2fs -p /dev/sda3 150G\nmount /dev/sda3 /home\n\nIt worked.\nAnd then I viewed the information by df -lh\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\nudev            1.9G  8.0K  1.9G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           384M  1.3M  383M   1% /run\n/dev/sda1        23G   12G   11G  53% /\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            1.9G  164K  1.9G   1% /run/shm\nnone            100M   52K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sda3       148G   87G   54G  62% /home\n\nBut I don't know how to do next.How can I make use of the free space?\n\nA: Gparted is a great tool for partitioning your HDD/SSD.

Pulled the PCI card and inserted Alfa AWUSO36NHV (USB) and usage settled down.

Was not running any internet associated software and was not updating at the time.  Next time it happens, I'll run top and post a screen grab.\n\nA: Your system is never idle.

Apparently this is a well documented problem on several distros. Not sure it qualifies as a bug. It maybe be hardware or firmware related.

On Ubuntu Phone this is very unconvient because the application has to switch to the contact register for every name i want to add. With over 100 of contacts this gets pretty annoying. Anybody knows a more elegant solution? Something like a check box for the conctacs register?\n\nA: If you type in the To field of a new message it will suggest matching contacts and you can tap to select one. Then you can type another name in the same To field and so on.\n\nA: This is a slightly hack-ish solution and I haven't actually tested all of it (and due to the lack of a SIM card won't be able to, in the near future), but it might be helpful.\nFirstly, you'll either need to either install the terminal app on your phone, if you haven't already, or connect to your phone from your computer (simply via adb shell or using ssh â for details see here). In any case, you'll need to enable developer mode on your phone.\nSending text messages via cli\nAccording to this \"Ubuntu phone gitbook\", you can send sms from the command-line using /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms. If you run the program without any arguments, you'll get the rather terse help message:\nUsage: /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms [modem] <to> <message> <delivery report>\n\nIt seems that \"modem\" can take the values /ril_0 and /ril_1 (for two SIM-cards â run mc-tool dump and inspect the lines \"modem-objpath\" if for other models these are different), \"to\" and \"message\" are self-explanatory (the telephone number and content of the message) and \"delivery report\" is presumably a boolean that determines whether you get a delivery report(?) â the guide sets it to 0, so we can probably do that as well.\nListing contacts via cli\nAgain, on the basis of the gitbook, it's possible to export your list of contacts cli to the file list_of_contact_telephone_numbers with this command:\nsyncevolution --export - backend=evolution-contacts | sed -n 's/^TEL;TYPE=[a-z,]*://p' | tr -d ' ' > list_of_contact_telephone_numbers\n\nI suggest that you edit/inspect this file to remove any special numbers and check for errors.\nSend SMS to all contacts\nAs a result, you should be able to send an SMS to all your contacts with the following:\ncat list_of_contact_telephone_numbers | while read contact\ndo\n    /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms /ril_0 \"$contact\" \"This is xxxx. My new phone number is +xxxx.\" 0\ndone\n\n(I suggest you first test this with only one line in list_of_contact_telephone_numbers to see if it works.)\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 8/ Ubuntu 16.04 Grub Issues I recently had to re-install Ubuntu because it would not boot after some software changes.

So I go \"Add Interface\" => Select \"Bond\" => Configure \"Bond mode\". This opens a window called \"Bonding configuration\" where I set \"Bond mode\" to 802.3ad and \"Bond monitor mode\" to miimon. At the bottom of the window appears a field \"Carrier type\" where you can select either \"netif\" or \"ioctl\".\nI've configured bonding before but never came accross these settings. What do these settings mean? And what should I choose on a fresh 16.04 Server installation?\nUpdate: Maybe somebody should tell the virt-manager guys that the timings under \"MII settings\" are actually milliseconds and not seconds!\n\nA: KVM networking is not my thing, really bugs me. That's why I had to dig a little deeper and found out that the \"Carrier type\" translates into the bond_use_carrier parameter in /etc/network/interfaces. Quote from here:\nuse_carrier\n\nSpecifies whether or not miimon should use MII or ETHTOOL\nioctls vs. netif_carrier_ok() to determine the link\nstatus. The MII or ETHTOOL ioctls are less efficient and\nutilize a deprecated calling sequence within the kernel.  The\nnetif_carrier_ok() relies on the device driver to maintain its\nstate with netif_carrier_on/off; at this writing, most, but\nnot all, device drivers support this facility.\n\nIf bonding insists that the link is up when it should not be,\nit may be that your network device driver does not support\nnetif_carrier_on/off.  The default state for netif_carrier is\n\"carrier on,\" so if a driver does not support netif_carrier,\nit will appear as if the link is always up.  In this case,\nsetting use_carrier to 0 will cause bonding to revert to the\nMII / ETHTOOL ioctl method to determine the link state.\n\nA value of 1 enables the use of netif_carrier_ok(), a value of\n0 will use the deprecated MII / ETHTOOL ioctls.  The default\nvalue is 1.\n\nSo, choose \"netif\" and then take your link offline. If your system doesn't recognize that the link is down, switch back to \"ioctl\".\n", "Q: How to update GIMP in Ubuntu 16.04 using snaps? I know that an application (GIMP) has had a recent update from 2.8.16 to 2.8.18 to fix some security issues. This recent update is not being pushed out by Snappy for Ubuntu 16.04.  I know this because I have a PPA on another machine running Ubuntu 14.04 which keeps GIMP up to date. The PPA keeps the software current on 14.04.  How do I ask Snappy to update GIMP on 16.04? \n\nA: The latest version of the gimp package in the 16.04 repositories (which is 2.8.16-1ubuntu1.1) includes a fix for the XCF vulnerability (CVE-2016-4994).

Got to this list, that says the file is part of libpython3.5-stdlib.\nWhat I did\nI downloaded the libpython3.5-stdlib DEB file from a mirror, and then run\n$ sudo dpkg -i /home/adam/Downloads/libpython3.5-stdlib_3.5.2-2~16.01_amd64.deb\n\nWhat I would try if it happened again\nI would try to run sudo apt-get install --reinstall libpython3.5-stdlib or sudo dpkg --reconfigure libpython3.5-stdlib before downloading. Not sure it would work, but it is worth the try.\n\nI am posting it because these steps proved helpful to me. I used to always solve problems with dpkg --reconfigure and/or apt-get install --reinstall, but it failed me now. This is a specific scenario but can be made a bit generic. Those are the generic steps I'd suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search the Internet for the file mentioned in the error.\n\n*If you found a package, try to reinstall this package, instead of the one whose installation is failing.\n\n*If you could not get it via dpkg --reconfigure or apt-get, download the package from a mirror and install with `dpkg -i . Pay attention to the version.\n\n*Eventually, if the installation fails, try to unpack the DEB file and copy the missing file to the correct path.\n\n*After all, if you got success, run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade, just to be sure.\n\n\nIt is not guaranteed it would solve your problems, but those are steps that helped me and I did not figured out before.\n", "Q: How to make Thunar regenerate thumbnails? I have a large collection on pictures which needed cropping, color balancing, autotuning, etc. Now Thunar is showing the old thumbnails and is very confusing because i can't visually separate edited pictures from unedited ones. How can i make Thunar automatically regenerate or create new thumbnails for the edited pictures?\n\nA: Remove all contents of ~/.cache/thumbnails/normal:\nrm ~/.cache/thumbnails/normal/*\n\n...and refresh the folder in thunar.\n\nA: Deleting ~/.cache/thumbnails/* didn't seem to help in my case, I had to regenerate thumbnails by refreshing (Ctrl+r) each view in Thunar.  That is, having the first set of files in view in Thunar, refresh, then scroll and select a file not in view, refresh, etc. until all files have been in view while refreshing.  Of course it's faster if you zoom out (Ctrl+-) to have more files in view.\nIt worked for JPGs, but the older thumbnails kept attached to raw (.NEF) files.\nI ended up using this more radical solutionÂ :\nrm $(locate thumbnails)\n\n\nA: Its required to delete both normal and large thumbnails:\nfind ~/.cache/thumbnails/ -type f -print -delete\n\n-print will print list of deleted files and can be removed.\n", "Q: I can't access my Windows 10 through GRUB I installed Windows 10 in UEFI mode, and after that I installed Ubuntu 16.04 in legacy / BIOS mode.\nNow the problem is I can't access my dual boot with GRUB.
