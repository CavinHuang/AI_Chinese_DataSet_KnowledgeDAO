Even with sudo. Even while execute (as well as read and write) permissions are granted to everyone and all the files owner is set to the user.\nSo how do I set the system up to be able to run Linux binaries from NTFS?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and the solution in my case was to write de exec mount option after the users option. That's because the users option implicitly activate the noexec option, so you have to explicitly specify exec.\nI got this from \"Why can't I run programs on another partition in Linux?\" on Unix & Linux Stack Exchange.\n\nA: There were a few people mulling this one over in the chat channels.  One of the people suggested that you take a look at George Edison's response to this question, and see if it helps you:\n.exe file permission fail\nNote that you will have to have additional mount options on an NTFS partition in order to execute binary files from those partitions directly - the users option, and also the exec option.  users permits unmounting by non-superusers (as well as mounting), and exec permits executables to be run from it (however, keep in mind this isn't a guarantee to make everything work).\n\nA: That is the \"feature\" of udisks package to, by default, restricts permission modification on ntfs partition (or other non-Linux partitions).\nTo enable this feature, you may want to read,\nEnable Setting Executable Permission of Files at NTFS Partition\n", "Q: In Empathy IRC, how do I turn off the \"joined\" and \"disconnected\" messages?

However, it is being developed by the same developer that is working on the Windows version (which works well in WINE, incidentally), and there has been continuous work on bug-fixing and feature upgrades since it was first released.  Discussion and bug reports can be found and made at the forums at Literature and Latte (the publisher).\n\nWikidPad is another option.  (Also see WikiPad's Sourceforge home.)\nSome of the published writers who do the Writing Excuses podcast use Wikid Pad (for the episode where this is mentioned, see #5-34, \"Story Bibles\").\nThis part of the description caught my eye:\n\nIDE for your thoughts\nSoftware developers have grown accustomed to certain features from their integrated development environment that\nmake their jobs easier.

In short, popwin makes you can close windows such like *Help*, *Completion* by press C-g in anytime. By the way, you can install it from ELPA.\n\nA: You could conceivably modify it to show completions in the minibuffer, but (a) you can't scroll the minibuffer sanely if needed, and (b) it would just expand and cover your other windows anyway.

I think I have understood the principle now, but I am having difficulties with the \"kill timeout\" stanza in upstart jobs.\nFor example, I have the following job (filename /etc/init/test.conf):\ndescription \"test\"\nstart on test\nconsole owner\nkill timeout 5\ntask\nexec /root/test\n\nThe file /root/test is a small shell script which runs forever:\nwhile true; do o=1; done;\n\nWhen doing \"initctl start test\", the job \"test\" is run and calls the script \"/root/test\". I can verify that by doing \"initctl status test\" which shows the job as running as well as by doing \"ps -Alf\".\nNow, the \"kill timeout 5\" stanza should cause the job to be killed after 5 seconds. But instead, the job seems to run forever.\nI would like to know if I am using and understanding the kill timeout stanza in the right way. It is an essential feature for me.\nThis is on Natty 11.04, but I think the question applies to other versions as well.\nThank you very much,\nBinarus\n\nA: That's not what kill timeout does; it specifies how long to wait after sending a polite \"terminate\" signal for the process to exit before giving up and launching nukes.\nIf you want to set a process time limit in the upstart way, the easiest way is probably to have something periodically issue a timer event, and use stop on timer.  Alternately (and perhaps more generally), create a wrapper program which forks a small process which sends an event after a time period, and stop on that event.\nFor more information and best practices,  see The Upstart Cookbook.\n", "Q: What is the best 2D driver for GeForce4 MX 440?

In the present GNOME 2.x desktop, it is a major burden trying to resize a window's size (e.g., placing the cursor in the lower right corner to increase or decrease the dimensions of the window). It is difficult to get the cursor to perform this action in GNOME 2.x.\nI'm really hoping the developers address this critical function and make window-resizing workable with Unity.\n\nA: we have a new resize grip in natty.\n\n\nA: No, it was still hard in Natty, and as of August 2011 it's still hard in Oneiric.  \nSome windows have grab handles, some don't.  Sometimes you can use Alt-middlebutton.  Some windows have a resize area larger than the visible border, but this doesn't work on unity-2d and perhaps not in some other cases.\nVote up bug 160311 (but don't add me-too comments.)\n\nA: Yes, resizing windows is improving quite a bit with Natty. In previous versions of Ubuntu, windows are difficult to resize because the window border of the default Ambiance theme is extremely thin and hard to click accurately (1 pixel wide, compared to ~8 pixels in Windows 7).  Natty is dropping the border completely, but the windows will actually be easier to resize thanks to an invisible 5-pixel border. Additionally, all windows will have a draggable grip area in the bottom-right corner.\nIf that doesn't take care of the issue, I'd recommend browsing Metacity themes on Gnome-Look for one with a thicker border.  Alternatively, you can easily edit any theme to make the border thicker and easier to click.\nIt's also possible to hold down the alt key, then middle-click-and-drag with the mouse to resize a window, even on versions of Ubuntu prior to Natty.\n", "Q: Admin authentication takes forever I am running ubuntu 10.10 installed through wubi.

I had ColdFusion/ shared with my VM through the VMWare tools, and it was working perfectly up until friday when the folder sharing just stopped. No updates on either mac or linux besides an iTunes update. I tried uninstalling the VMWare tools and reinstalling them but I get an error at the end of the install. It appears that when I reinstall the tools there are files left over from the old installation. Is there a way to force the unsinstall script to completely uninstall and remove all files for the VMWare-Tools?\nI know the shared folder used to mount at /mnt/hgfs/ColdFusion.\n\nA: I had the same problem running Kubuntu 10.04 in VMWare Fusion 3.1.3 on a Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Suddenly, after booting up in the morning, a folder, shared from the mac to the vm (linux), stopped working. The only thing I could think of the possible cause was the installation of nfs-kernel-server on the vm.\nFor me it worked to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut donw the virtual machine (Linux)\n\n*Disable the share in Fusion.\n\n*Disable sharing in Fusion.\n\n*Boot and shut down the vm again (most likely a superfluous step).\n\n*Enable sharing and recreate the share.\n\n*Boot the vm.\n\n*Reinstall VmWareTools (this step does really does it).\n\n\nNow the share was availble again and nfs server still worked too.\nAnd after rebooting the vm, all still worked ok.\n", "Q: Restart problem after installing graphical card driver My laptop is Lenovo T400, running Ubuntu 10.10. \n\n\n*\n\n*My problem: I just run jockey-gtk and installed ATI/AMD\nproprietary FGLRX graphics driver.\nBut after reboot, there is a short\nperiod of graphical \"Ubuntu\" and\nthen instead of starting X-window it completely changed to\ncommand line to ask me to login. \nEven after login and then issuing\nxinit, it still failed to start X.\n\n*To solve this problem: I followed this post, where one\nperson suggested to \n\nyou can simply write \nsudo apt-get remove fglrx\n\nThis worked for me.

How is it that Cfengine does not exist in the Ubuntu (10.04 LTS) Main Repository? I can't find a discussion of this anywhere (using Google).  The only configuration management in Ubuntu Main seems to be Puppet.\nI looked for a wide variety of others as well - all from Wikipedia's list of configuration management tools - and none of them are present in Ubuntu main. I looked for bcfg2, opensymbolic, radmind, smartfrog, spacewalk, staf, synctool, chef - none are present.\nFrom my vantage point as a system administrator, I would have expected to find at least bcfg2, puppet, cfengine, and chef (as the most widely used tools).\nWhy is cfengine (or chef and others) not included in Ubuntu main? Why is there only one configuration management tool in Ubuntu main?\nBy the way - the reason this is important in the context of server administration is because Ubuntu main is fully supported by the Ubuntu team with updates and security updates; the other repositories are not.\n\nA: First off, bcfg2, chef, and cfengine are all in the universe repository, which is a community supported repository of software. It is better explained here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/components\nThe most relevant portion of that page here is\n\n\"Popular or well supported pieces of software will move from universe into main if they are backed by maintainers willing to meet the standards set by the Ubuntu team.\"\n\nWhen you're talking about server related software, main is really a giant commitment.\nAt some point, one has to think about the burden that the maintenance of all the packages in main puts on Ubuntu as a project. LTS server releases in particular are supported with security updates for 5 years. So when the MIR team and greater Ubuntu development community looks at whether something should go into main, one of the first things they look at is whether there isn't already something with feature parity in main.\nMany times, Ubuntu will still go forward with adopting the package for main. MySQL and PostgreSQL are both in main and at this point have very similar functions and features. This is in large part because there are massive groups of Ubuntu users who use either one, and plenty of people out there maintaining the software.\nIn the case of configuration management solutions, cfengine, puppet, and chef, all seem to offer a high degree of overlap in functionality, and zero compatibility. So there's an opportunity to make an opinionated decision for users who haven't chosen one. In this case, those involved with that decision up to now have chosen Puppet for a number of reasons which have been discussed at Ubuntu Developer Summits (UDS) in detail many times.\nThis choice is always up for discussion. Chef, Cfengine, anything else, just need to have somebody willing to make a compelling case that it will serve a large number of Ubuntu users to include the software in main.\nI would encourage you then to read through the requirements here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMainInclusionRequirements\nAnd file a MIR request if you think it will pass, using this process:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess\nIf you're not getting much traction on your MIR, file a blueprint attached to an upcoming UDS (UDS-Oneiric is coming up in May in Budapest). You don't have to fly all the way to Budapest to join the discussion (note that sponsorship is available on a limited basis), you can attend virtually. Either way, I think its clear that the Ubuntu development community wants to hear from you and any other users who feel that Ubuntu can be improved.\n", "Q: Twinview on Gnome when monitor is unplugged i have a macbook pro which is often connected to a monitor, twin view on gnome works pretty well, but a problem arises when i disconnect the monitor, any window that resided on that workspace is no longer available.\nanother issue is when i start my computer when a monitor is not present, because xorg.conf file has the monitor configuration in it, my mouse pointer often disappears in the other monitor's virtual space, as if it is currently plugged,\nosx deals with this issue elegantly by refreshing the display every time a plug in/out occurs,\nis there anything similar that can be done in linux ?\n> xrandr --auto\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\n\n> xrandr\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 3200 x 1080, current 3200 x 1080, maximum 3200 x 1080\ndefault connected 3200x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n   3200x1080      50.0* \n\nmy first monitor is a macbookpro 5.5 13 inch display, and the second is a 24 inch display working at 1980x1024 (1080p) resolution\n\nA: This usually works out of the box on Ubuntu, but there could be a problem with this specific hardware.

Supposedly Unity and Gnome3 misbehave when running concurrently on a single installation.\nIf you have access to your system with either Unity or Ubuntu Classic, run Synaptic and remove all instance of both unity and overlay-scrollbars from your computer (removing Unity will add other packages including Unity-2d).  The first time I ran gnome-shell I got a system error and was force logged-out to the GDM.  But the second attempt was successful and saw no errors afterwards.\nKubuntu is my main system for everyday use and I installed Ubuntu on a separate partition was a test system to try out Gnome3.

When I open a new tab in Chromium, it displays the 'new tab' page, which (among other things) contains the 'most visited' pages.  I want to add a new webpage to that list.  How do I do that?\nI've tried visiting the webpage several times, and clicking the 'X' for the other choices, but it never shows up.  Is there a way to manually edit what pages show up there?\n\nA: \"Most Visited\" section on new tab in Chrome/Chromium can be edited by hand, by directly changing \"Top Sites\" sqlite3 database inside Chrome/Chromium with sqlite3 and SQL (or by any other sqlite3 db editor, like sqlitebrowser).\nThe \"Top Sites\" database is located in user profile directory, the default one is \"~/.config/chromium/Default/Top Sites\" (for chrome: ~/.config/google-chrome/default, in windows C:\\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default).\nTo edit it, close the Chromium/Chrome and run for GUI editor\nsudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser\nsqlitebrowser ~/.config/chromium/Default/Top\\ Sites\n\nOpen thumbnails table in Browse Data tab. We (and forensics experts) can see much more entries than is shown in \"Most Visited\". \nOnly eight sites with smallest \"url rank\" and not blacklisted by user are shown. You can see them with such SQL query (via \"Execute SQL\" tab in sqlitebrowser or by using sqlite3 ~/.config/chromium/Default/Top\\ Sites command line tool):\nselect url, url_rank, at_top from thumbnails order by url_rank;\n\nNow you can edit the database, changing url_ranks to reorder sites (you should shift half of url_ranks, if you are inserting in middle). You can ever add new url, and change all url_ranks to move your new url into \"Most Visited\".\nWhen user deleted the site from \"Most Visited\" section by clicking \"x\" button, the url is blacklisted in the JSON config file ~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences, in ntp.most_visited_blacklist section (close the Chrome, open the Preferences with text editor like gedit or vim, search for most_visited_blacklist and see URLHashes of blacklisted sites, implemented as MD5 of url string). You can delete all urls from most_visited_blacklist section (make sure that you have backup of Preferences file)\nPS Actual source code of \"Most Visited\" implementation in Chromium: chrome/browser/history/top_sites_database.cc file, line 438, void TopSitesDatabase::GetPageThumbnails function:\n  \"SELECT url, url_rank, title, thumbnail, redirects, \"\n  \"boring_score, good_clipping, at_top, last_updated, load_completed, \"\n  \"last_forced FROM thumbnails ORDER BY url_rank, last_forced\"));\n\n// Results are sorted by url_rank. For forced thumbnails with url_rank = -1,\n// thumbnails are sorted by last_forced.\n\nDescriptions of some table fields are here: chrome/common/thumbnail_score.h\nBlacklisting implemented in chrome/browser/history/top_sites_impl.cc, TopSitesImpl::AddBlacklistedURL, TopSitesImpl::RemoveBlacklistedURL (Hmm, used only by test, but not accessible in UI some time after url was blacklisted?)\n\nA: You can use Chromium extension called Speed Dials instead. \nSpeed Dial replaces the Chrome\\Chromium's new tab page with your predefined visual bookmarks.\n\nTo add a web page, just click on the Speed Dial toolbar button and select \"Add this page\". from this menu you can also open the Speed dial page to access your visual bookmarks.\n  When you're on the Speed Dial page, you can use drag-n-drop to change the thumbnail position.\n  Speed Dial let you customize the page look and feel by a predefined themes. You can also set a background image.\n\n\nNote: It doesn't show the apps section.So whenever you need to access them , you need to disable it.\n\nIf you don't like Speed dials; there are some steps you can do to keep the websites that you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear Browsing History (Tools--->Clear browsing History).\n\n*Go to a specific website you want to keep.\n\n*The website will appear now on the \"most visited\" section, click on the pin as in this picture:\n\n4.Repeat from step 2 for every website.\n\nA: You can't - not without visiting that site enough to make it into one of your \"Most Visited\" sites. \n(Via Google Chrome Help)\n\nA: You could remove your browers history and then go back to the site you want to see and would'll see it but the old entry's will be gone.\n\nA: No idea if this only works with Google chrome but first bookmark the site you want on that page. While on the home page click and drag the bookmark to any space, used or empty, the cursor changes to an + ,click here. Next time you open the browser your site should be there. You can also fix or delete these shortcuts in that homepage\n\nA: I am not sure, but I think I used to have a version of chrome with a page similar offered by speed dials, but you can still see the apps page. However, using speed dials you cant get access to speed dials.\n", "Q: Boot failure : No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!

Since Ubuntu relies on upstart for some time now, I would like to use an upstart job to gracefully shutdown certain applications on system shutdown or reboot. It is essential that the system's shutdown or reboot is stalled until these applications are shut down.\nThe applications will be started manually on occasion, and on system shutdown should automatically be ended by a script (which I already have). Since the applications can't be ended reliably without (nearly all) other services running, ending the applications has to be done before the rest of the shutdown begins.\nI think I can solve this by an upstart job which will be triggered on shutdown, but I am unsure which events I should use in which manner. So far, I have read the following (partly contradicting) statements:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no general shutdown event in upstart\n\n*Use a stanza like start on starting shutdown in the job definition\n\n*Use a stanza like start on runlevel [06S] in the job definition\n\n*Use a stanza like start on starting runlevel [06S] in the job definition\n\n*Use a stanza like start on stopping runlevel [!06S] in the job definition\n\n\nFrom these recommendations, the following questions arise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there or is there not a general shutdown event in Ubuntu's upstart?\n\n*What is the recommended way to implement a \"shutdown hook\"?\n\n*When are the events runlevel [x] triggered; is this when having entered the runlevel or when entering the runlevel?\n\n*Can we use something like start on starting runlevel [x] or start on stopping runlevel [x]?\n\n*What would be the best solution for my problem?\n\n\nThank you very much\n\nA: starting and runlevel are separate events, so you can't meaningfully say starting runlevel N.\nThe runlevel N event is emitted at the start of entering the runlevel.  If you start on runlevel N then your task runs on entry.  The way to run when entry to the runlevel is completed is run on started rc RUNLEVEL=N.\nAs I understand it, you need a start on runlevel [06S] to do what you want; it should in theory run before anything else is stopped.  For finer control you might use start on stopping apache or stopping mysql or ... so that your task runs before any of them are allowed to be shut down.\n\nEdited to change runlevel 5 to S.\n\nA: In order to stop the shutdown from proceeding while your job stops, you will want to use this:\nstop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016]\n\nThis will work because the first thing that happens when you type 'shutdown' is tunlevel 0 is emitted. rc starts on runlevel, and the transition from stopped -> starting will block completely until any jobs which also must change state do complete that state.\nYou'll want to make sure that your process responds quickly to SIGTERM. If it does not respond within 5 seconds, upstart will send it SIGKILL. You can raise that with 'kill timeout X'.\nThe 1 in there, btw is a bit tricky, you need to make sure your start on includes something that starts on runlevel [2345] at that point, so that a user going down for single user mode maintenance gets their job started again. Luckily a lot of work has gone into making this the suggested usual start on\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\nAlso in some cases you need something to keep running right up until the network is brought down (such as dbus/network-manager). For that you want\nstop on deconfiguring-networking\n\nThat is an event emitted later in the shutdown that will also be blocked on until any jobs that use it fully complete their transitions in state.\n\nA: Geekosaur, thank you very much for your help.\nIn the meantime, I have tried the start on runlevel [016] method, but it did not work, and I think I understand why:\nThe job has been started indeed, but the shutdown process has not been blocked until the job's task was finished. I am quite sure now that the events starting and stopping are the only events which can be used in a job definition to block other jobs, and I think that this is what Upstart's manuals try to tell us. Therefore, using the runlevel event will never lead to blocking other jobs or the shutdown process; thus, it is useless for my purpose.\nInstead, I seem to have two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Following one of your propositions, find out all jobs which the repective applications need, and include all of them in the start event for the script like that:\nstart on stopping job1 or stopping job2 or ...\n\nThis is so much work that I am seriously thinking of dumping the job list and running it through sed to automatically produce a start stanza for my job which includes all jobs which normally are running on the system.\nThe advantage would be that the respective applications would be shut down even when somebody stops one of the prerequisites manually (as opposed to stopping them by a runlevel change / shutdown / reboot).\n\n*Find the one job which will be stopped at first when rebooting / shutting down the system (let's call this job \"FirstJob\") and use that job in a stanza like:\nstart on stopping FirstJob\n\nThe main disadvantages would be that I don't know if such a job exists at all and if that job really depends on all other jobs which the repective application actually depends on (\"depends on other job\" in this case means \"will be stopped completely before other job begins to stop\").\nI am not sure which of the two possibilities is the better one...\n", "Q: Removing pulseaudio, about ALSAMixer I removed pulseaudio today because rosetta stone had conflicts identifying the microphone which kinda makes it useless to me to learn a new language.

Then I try to mount the drive in Linux, but I keep getting\n/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: Protocol error\n\nI have read so many solutions to this, but none seem to work.  I have tried:\n\n*\n\n*Using the mount.vboxsf syntax\n\n*Reinstalling VBox additions\n\n*Rebooting\n\n*Enabling and trying as root account\n\nI made a share called \"Test\" in VBox Shared folders.  Then I made a directory in ubuntu named \"test2\".  Then I tried to execute this command:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf Test /mnt/test2\n\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: In order to use shared folder functionality few prerequisites need to be met:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that Guest Additions are properly installed on the guest OS.\n\n*Users in a guest Ubuntu must be in the group vboxsf to be able to access shares.\n\n*Define a directory on the host that will be used in the virtual machine using the settings dialogue of Virtual Box.\n\n\nDepending on host or guest OS the following may also be needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not share personal folders like /home/username or My Documents\n\n*Avoid special characters or empty spaces in the path to the shared folder, especially if the host or VM is a Windows machine\n\n*Use different names for share and mountpoint\n\n*Create a mountpoint on the guest OS (best in your HOME directory).\n\n\nTesting shared folders functionality can be done by creating a shared directory on the host (e.g. C:\\myshare), define this as a shared folder for your guest system in Virtual Box settings (e.g. share), create a mount point in your guest os (e.g.  mkdir /home/username/host) and mount this in the guest OS with the command:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 share /home/username/host\n\nwhere the option -o makes sure that you will have access to the mount (that will otherwise be owned by root).\nFor further information on shared folders see also the Virtual Box User Manual.\nFiles or directories can also be shared over the network by using Samba on the host and the guest.\n\nA: I also struggled a lot with the mounting, and tried everything I come up with in the interwebz but I finally found a very weird workaround to solve it! My guest is Ubuntu 13 and my host is Windows 7.\nChange to the media folder and from there type user@os:/media$ sudo mount -t vboxsf share /home/username/folder\nYeah, that's it.

No error this time.\n\nA: With VirtualBox 5.1.20 running on Windows 10, and Ubuntu 16.04 as the guest OS with GuestAdditions 5.1.20 installed, I couldn't mount the shared folders from the command line. The mount commands failed, with mentions of Protocol Error and sf_read_super_aux err=-22.\nEventually I found https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/16670 \"mount.vboxsf symlink broken\". I followed one of the workarounds there, to correct the symlink for mount.vboxsf, and it all worked. My approach was to do:\n\nmv /sbin/mount.vboxsf /sbin/mount.vboxsf-orig\nln -s /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-5.1.20/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions/mount.vboxsf /sbin/mount.vboxsf\n\nThe commands need to be done by root. So, because it was Ubuntu, I added \"sudo \" at the beginning of each line to do the command as root. Other flavors of Linux have other ways of doing that.\nAs an aside, there was a similar symlink problem reported in virtualbox's Ticket #12879 \"Can't mount shared folders with guest additions 4.3.10\" in 2014, that was fixed the following month.\n2017-04-27\n\nA: For me, the problem was that I was a goose, and I'd forgotten that I'd removed the entry from my Shared Folders list in VirtualBox (Machine→Settings→Shared Folders).\nI'm just throwing this in here, in case anybody else is ever similarly mislead by 'Protocol error'.\n:honk: \n\nA: I tried a few answers and then saw void's comment saying he restarted the Linux guest OS and re-mounted.\nWorked for me. :)\n\nA: My shared folder was working and after rebooting my host, it wasn't.\nBy changing the name of the shared folder from Shared to Shared2 it worked.\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \"/Users/username/Dropbox/Shared\", \"/Shared2\"\n\nNo idea on what happened and why nor how to fix.\nSystem with no global mutable state like Nix do have a point.\n\nA: Personally I faced the same error message and the problem was related to the fact I did a typo related to the folder located on the host machine and which I set as a shared folder from within the virtual machine thanks to the guest additions.\nSo the right command is:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$(id -g) shared_folder_located_in_host_machine path_to_mounting_folder_inside_the_virtual_machine\n\nThis fixed the error message.\n\nA: For me it was the wrong version of guest-additions.\nI moved my whole VM from one laptop (which ran VirtualBox 5.8/something) to another laptop with VirtualBox 6.0. Everything worked except the mounting of shared folder.\nI just started VM, clicked on Devices -> Insert Guest additions CD image... and followed instructions. It cribbed a bit about presence of older version of guest additions, but then removed it and installed the new one on second attempt.

Is Gnome SoundConverter for instance able to achieve it ?\n\nA: I think Sound Juicer(Click To Install) is a good tool for conversions.\nI use Banshee for my conversions from cd to Flac or Mp3.\nFor Banshee go first to Edit-->preferences and change the folder and the output type and then from the main GUI you can push the button for conversion. \nOf course you can use Gnome sound converter.\n\nA: I'm a geek. I enjoy torturing myself with the command line. I used to study the lame man page to find the best settings every time I ripped a new cd. Eventually I got tired of this and recorded my settings in a simple script. So after I rip a CD to a folder, I run this command to turn the lovely lossless FLAC files into ipod friendly MP3s:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *.flac\ndo\n    $(flac -cd \"$file\" | \\\n    lame -b 128 -B 320 --replaygain-accurate -V 2 --vbr-new - \\\n    \"${file%.flac}.mp3\")\ndone\n\nThe key here is the lame command. Respectively, it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensures a minimum bitrate of 128\n\n*Caps the bitrate at 320 (which is the max for mp3)\n\n*Adds fancy ReplayGain analysis info to the file\n\n*Use variable bitrate, quality level 2\n\n*Use the \"new\" super fast variable bit rate algorithm\n\n\nThen I tag my files with Picard which automagically adds tons of ID3 information from its extensive MusicBrainz database.\n\nA: I'll take a different tack.  There is another app in the Ubuntu Repos called abcde.\nYou can install it like this:\nsudo apt-get install abcde cd-discid lame cdparanoia id3 id3v2\nnb. This also installs Postfix as a dependency, but you can remove it safely after installation.\nThen copy over the config:\ncp /etc/abcde.conf ~/.abcde.conf\nOpen this new copy of ~/.abcde.conf file in your favorite editor.\nUncomment the Lame Encoder on line 134:\n# Encoders:\nLAME=lame\n\nUncomment and edit line 363 with your CD/DVD-ROM Drive:\nCDROM=/dev/cdrom\n\nUncomment and edit the output directory:\nOUTPUTDIR=~/music/\n\nSave and close the document.\nInsert your CD into your CD/DVD-ROM Drive.\nOpen your Terminal and type abcde, sit back and let the magic happen :)\nThe output folder ~/music/ should eventually fill up with all your songs in glorious MP3, with IDv3 tags and proper naming.\nOccasionally, you may need to fix them yourself though.\nThere are a LOT of possible output options, and you should seriously read through ~/.abcde.conf carefully.  It's very well commented.\nThis is a little bit of work, but once it's done, you dont really have to worry anymore.  Just run the terminal command and done :)\n\nA: Actually, CDA only represents a shortcut of audio track. In reality, it does not have any music file in it. That’s the reason why you cannot play the files without the original CD in your computer drive. To solve this problem, you’d better convert your CDA files to the most common mp3 format.

I would like to do some search and/or replace using regular expression in gedit. If I am correct, by default it is impossible to do this. So I was wondering if someone can recommend some nice plugin for this feature? How to install such plugin? Thanks and regards!\n\nA: The best regular expression plugin is advanced-find. Check it out and I am sure you'll be satisfied.\n\nA: See - https://wiki.gnome.org/GeditPlugins. The regular expression plugin is linked there as well as even more plugins and instructions on installation - (at the bottom of the page).\n", "Q: Questions about using Regex Search & Replace in gedit I am trying to use the Regex Search & Replace plugin of gedit.\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to search for a digit that\nrepeats 2 or 3 times, so I thought\nthe regex was  \n[0-9]\\{2,3\\}\n\nBut it doesn't match the targets it\nshould, such as \"22\".\n\n*I want to find a word \"Notes\"\nexactly, so I thought it would be \n\\<Notes\\> \n\nBut it doesn't work either.\n\n*How to add a \"#\" in front of a\nstring of any three digits\n\"[0-9][0-9][0-9]\"? e.g. \"123\" becomes \"#123\".\n\n\nI was wondering if I made some mistake? I am using Basic Regex. What type of Regex is used in the plugin? How can I learn how to use this plugin?\n\nA: You should not need to escape your regex characters. Your first example should be:\n[0-9]{2,3}\n\nYour second example should be:\n\\bNote\\b\n\nFor the third situation, you'll need to match things before and after, then use back-references:\n(.*)([0-9]{3}.*)\n\nwith the replacement being:\n\\1p\\2\n\nFor more details, see pydoc re that will tell you about Python regular expression syntax, or the online documentation.\n\nA: As Kees says, the plugin uses Python's re module syntax, which also has a How-To on the python site.\nI also recommend installing and playing around with kodos  .\nIt's a python regular expression tester (it calls itself a 'debugger'), and includes a quick reference regex sheet as well as a shorter version of the re module documentation.\nThe regular-expression.info site has a nice comparison of different implementations of regular expression meta-languages.

I have added 2 more disks went into the bios deleted and created a new raid setup using raid 10 (total of 4 disks now). \nHowever during install of ubuntu server it asks if it should activate the RAID Sata disks, I tell it yes. Next step shows up blank for available disks when determining where to mount the root etc. Anyone have a clue as to why this would be?\n\nA: My guess is that you have a fakeraid ( see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto for background info ).  Fakeraid is not supported as well as conventional software raid, so you should not use it if you don't need to dual boot with Windows.  Go into the bios and delete all traces of the raid array, and when you run the Ubuntu server installer, just set up a conventional mdadm software raid.\nBefore you do that though, if you could file a bug report on launchpad.net against the dmraid package in ubuntu, and attach to that report the files generated by running sudo dmraid -rD, I would appreciate it.  This way I may get around to fixing the problem.  You can do this from the livecd.\n\nA: I've noticed Disk Utility recognizes my dm-raid drives twice. For example, my RAID0 drive (two 200GB drives) shows up as dm-0 (400GB) and dm-4 (400GB). Perhaps you need to activate a different one.\nOne thing that sounds odd there is that term \"activate\". I'm not sure that the installer should need to activate a dm-raid partition (what you're trying to use); I've only noticed that with Linux-based softRAID.\nAlso, you might need to reboot & restart the installer. I've seen it fail many times when saving changes to partitions; after a reboot, the changes are intact and the installer recognizes them.\n", "Q: 3 monitors with 2 video cards not working I'm trying to get ubuntu working w/ 3 monitors.

I also got in troubles with the USB image but I did another one image and it works for me\n\nA: I've heard that instead of installing the netbook version you should install the full desktop edition of 10.10 (32-bit).  I've done that on my newer HP Mini netbooks, and it works perfectly (also done this with slightly older Acer netbooks in the 1.5 - 2 year old age range).\n\nA: On some Aspire netbooks you need to enable you need to turn on network boot in the BIOS.\nSee more here.\n", "Q: Video driver for an Acer 5253 I installed 10.10 on an Acer 5253-BZ684.

I have an old Toshiba Satellite with a 1.1 MHz and 256MB RAM. Initially I couldn't get my wireless to work. That solved itself after installing various updates and programs.\nThe problems that remain are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I have to authorize at least 2 times at start-up. This machine is Ubuntu only. No boot load screen. \n\n*I have a ton of programs and system directories that are in my home folder. Is this normal? \n\n*It is difficult to wake the computer from sleep. Usually I just shut it down and restart. Tonight I waited and got a message about corrupt memory.\n\n*The computer takes forever to do just about everything. Slow to start programs or doing things on the web.\nI am a longtime Mac user (since 1986). I also manage a network of several windows machines. I am definitely a GUI guy and do very little in the terminal so I really need to know where to begin to get things straightened out. Can I rescue this machine without wiping it and doing a fresh install? This is basically a hobby machine. Aside from all the programs and upgrades I've installed, I have almost no files or documents to worry about saving. \nAnyone have any ideas about the problems I'm having and the best way to proceed?\n\nA: Due to the facts the specs stated I would recommend Lubuntu for a less intensive-resource-heavy operation.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you mean directories like /usr /var /root and others, yes that's normal.\n\n*This could be incompatibilities between your computer and the system (although I doubt it)\n\n*10.10 is not light on the system.  The issue being that since you have such little RAM and such a slow processor, its going to be slow on your system.  There are lighter builds of Ubuntu, but I personally don't know what they are.\n\n", "Q: Can I install Natty alongside Maverick and retain my encrypted /home partition? This is my partitioning scheme: \n\n\n*\n\n*10GB partition empty -- will be installing Natty here\n\n*10GB partition containing Maverick\n\n*2GB swap partition\n\n*300GB encrypted /home partition\n\n\nI've had few problems in the past with having two ubuntu installs on two separate partitions, giving /home it's own partition, but I'm a little concerned since I'm now using an encrypted /home partition. Install won't try to wipe my /home if I click \" encrypt home directory,\" will it? \n\nA: I've not done exactly what you're trying to do, and I'm not sure what will happen when you select the 'Encrypt my home folder' option, but I do have some advice when you come to performing the installation. \nI keep my entire system on a single partition, and at the time I had an encrypted home directory. I reinstalled my system according to my answer to this question, and when I logged into my fresh system, I found I was unable to access my home directory. I later realised this was because when I was going through the installation process in Ubiquity, I specified either a different username, password or hostname (I can't remember which) and the encryption mechanism built into Ubuntu uses those three parameters as authorisation credentials for partition decryption when you log in, so you'll want to ensure you keep those three the same.\n\nA: So I tried it, and it turns out everything works quite nicely. If your /home partition is already encrypted, it'll automatically select (and prevent you from deselecting) \"encrypt my home folder.\" Then when you boot up everything works as expected. \n\nA: Hopefully it would prompt before erasing, but yes, erasing is the behaviour I'd expect. \n", "Q: Replace string in bash script I tried the following command in my script:\nfind=grep \"$jasper\" jasperreports.properties | awk -F\"reports/\" '{print $2}'\n\nExample output:\nmaps\n\nI want to change this output to something else, e.g. charts. For that, I tried:\nsed -i /\"$find\"/charts\n\nsed is causing me problems, it needs an input file but I don't have one. Is there a way to pipe the output from grep and awk to sed?\n\nA: You can always provide a pseudo-file with the < <(command) process substitution syntax:\nsed -e \"/$find/charts\" < <(grep \"$jasper\" jasperreports.properties | awk -F\"reports/\" '{print $2}')\n\n\nA: -i can only be used with sed if you're passing a file, it means \"inline replace\". Without this, the output of sed would be written to stdout (usually the console output). With -i, it does an inline replacement, that is, doing replacements in the file itself.\nThe next code reads the contents of jasperreports.properties into the variable $input (line 1) and finds the string to be replaced (line 2).\nOn the third line, it outputs the input string and pipes it through sed for replacement. sed outputs the string to stdout which will be caught by $( and ), and therefore be stored in $input.\nread input < jasperreports.properties\nfind=$(grep \"$jasper\" jasperreports.properties | awk -F\"reports/\" '{print $2}')\ninput=$(echo \"$input\" | sed \"s/$find/charts/\")\n\nIf you want to apply the changes immediately to the file:\nfind=$(grep \"$jasper\" jasperreports.properties | awk -F\"reports/\" '{print $2}')\nsed \"s/$find/charts/\" -i jasperreports.properties\n\nFrom man sed:\n   s/regexp/replacement/\n          Attempt   to   match  regexp  against  the  pattern  space.

You really don't want to mess around with make install for a kernel. Kernels are fairly huge things you want them in packages where you can quickly go \"get rid of this please!\" with a quick \"apt-get remove\".\n\n*The \"old fashioned way\" as described in the Kernel/Compile document is the single best way I know how to compile kernels on Ubuntu with random (non-Ubuntu-specific) sources like Kernel.org.\n\n*Skip the make localmodconfig step. It can be useful but more times than not, it just seems to break things (for me).\n\n*I wouldn't suggest you configure the entire kernel by yourself. Pull in the latest copy of the Ubuntu configuration and base off that. That will get you a good sane default that you can prune down. When you build the next version just pull the config forward and do a make oldconfig to see if there are any new options (common when jumping between major versions).\n\n*If you're building 2.6.38 on Maverick, I suggest you pull back Natty's config. You'll need to download the package from packages.ubuntu.com and extract the config file from its boot folder. I've already asked if there's an easier way of doing this, but there doesn't appear to be.\nIn short: Just follow the \"old fashioned way\" to the letter. Once you've built yourself a few packages and you know what you're doing, play around with the formula.\n\nA: Compilig kernel in ubuntu is really easy. I used the alternate build method a few weeks back, and it worked perfectly. I think you should try that method because it does several things automatically for you, meaning less things that can be  screwed up. \nHowever, the method you describe should also work in general, so chances are that you perhaps followed an outdated guide or did something wrong.\n", "Q: custom libindicator icon is not displayed I want to change the statusicon of my own little reminder program.\nCurrently I am using GTK.StatusIcon but I want to use a ApplicationIndicator.\nTherefore I created an own Icon and moved it to: \n/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/status/22\n\nIt is named indicator-notify.svg\nHeres the code for the icon.\nind = appindicator.Indicator (\"notify\",\n                          \"indicator-notify\",\n                          appindicator.CATEGORY_APPLICATION_STATUS)\nind.set_status (appindicator.STATUS_ACTIVE)\n\nThis Icon is not displayed.

I noticed à 30% of avahi daemon on Kubuntu 10.10 on a Lenovo T410 (this is the value given by top, not by the task manager of krunner).\nThis was far too high. Trying to suppress plasmoid one by one I managed to narrow down the CPU usage to the system tray. Then I did a few more test and actually everything is just until is open the Network manager in the system tray and log to my wired connection. So it seems that asking Kubuntu to use a wired connection make the avahi daemon using 30% of the CPU. Turning it off doesn't make the CPU usage go down afterwards.\nDo you know what could cause this problem? Anyone else realized that?\nEDIT: After a few more test I can confirm this is really a problem due to wired connection, it doesn't do that with a wireless connection.\nEDIT#2: I checked from home. This is not a problem with every eth0 connection. At home where dhcp works I don't see the increase in CPU usage. It happens only at work, where I add to manually enter the ip adress gateway etc. Also removing the internet cable drop the CPU usage down. Very strange.\n\nA: So in the end the problem was that there was too much traffic on the network caused by a badly configured printer. The overload of packets and the adress of the printer was detected by \"tcpdump\" command. \nI understand that in the end the problem was neither due to ubuntu nor linux.

But the same problem continues.\nHow can I resolve this issue, any ideas? \n\nA: See if by chance Nautilus is running, if you start it without any options - it starts desktop, as result everything starts to look as gnome.\n", "Q: Is there an apt command to download a deb file from the repositories to the current directory? I am often interested in the installation triggers (postinst, postrm) or certain parts of packages (like /usr/share and /etc). Currently, I am running the next command to retrieve the source code:\napt-get source [package-name]\n\nThe downside is, this file is often much bigger than the binary package and does not reflect the installation tree.\nRight now, I am downloading the packages through http://packages.ubuntu.com/:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for [package-name]\n\n*Select the package\n\n*Click on amd64/i386 for download\n\n*Download the actual file\n\n\nThis takes too long for me and as someone who really likes the shell, I would like to do something like the next (imaginary) command:\napt-get get-deb-file [package-name]\n\nI could not find something like this in the apt-get manual page. The most close I found was the --download-only switch, but this puts the package in /var/cache/apt/archives (which requires root permissions) and not in the current directory.\n\nA: You can use the download sub-command of apt, apt-get or aptitude. For example, if $PKG is the package you want, any of these will do:\napt-get download $PKG\napt download $PKG\naptitude download $PKG\n\nThis doesn't require root privileges. The same can also be approximated using apt-get and wget:\nwget $(apt-get install --reinstall --print-uris -qq $PKG | cut -d\"'\" -f2)\n\nThis will, however, fetch all packages required to install the package, so you can attempt to limit it instead:\nwget $(apt-get install --reinstall --print-uris -qq $PKG | cut -d\"'\" -f2 | grep \"/${PKG}_\")\n\nYou can also put a wget line into a function, to be able to use it as a command apt-download with the package name as a parameter:\nfunction apt-download { wget -c $(apt-get install --reinstall --print-uris -qq $1 | cut -d\"'\" -f2); }\n\nNote the modifications: The $PKG is replaced with $1 and the -c parameter enables continuing interrupted downloads.\n\nA: sudo apt-get -o dir::cache::archives=\"/path/to/folder/\" -d install package\n\nNote: \nYou need to create an folder named partial in destination folder.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 (apt package version 1.0.1ubuntu2, I believe), apt-get includes the download command to download the given package as a .deb in the current directory.\nFor example, suppose we want to download the file manager Ranger:\n$ apt-get download ranger\n\nResults in:\n$ ls . | grep ranger\nranger_1.6.0-1_all.deb\n\n\nA: If you want to download all deb packages from a list, you can do this:\ncat path/to/text/file.txt | xargs apt-get install --reinstall --print-uris -qq $PKG | cut -d\"'\" -f2 | xargs wget\n\nJust put one package name per line. Like in a requirements.txt file.\nFor example, with contents like this:\napache2-mpm-event\ncurl\ndmidecode\nethtool\nlibapache2-mod-wsgi\nlibapache2-mod-python\n\nHope this helps. ;)\n\nA: sudo apt-get install devscripts\ndget [package-name]\n\nA: /var/cache/apt/archives is world readable.  After apt-get -d, just extract it from there to your home directory.  Run dpkg -e /var/cache/apt/archives/foo_version.deb foo while in your home directory and the control files will be dumped into foo/.\n\nA: You can use command debget which is included in the package debian-goodies.\nInstall it with:\nsudo apt install debian-goodies\n\nDownload packages using:\ndebget <package_name>\n\nFor example:\ndebget debian-goodies\n\nWhich will download debian-goodies_0.79_all.deb in your current directory (do pwd to print your current working directory).\n", "Q: How do I start \"Ubuntu classic desktop\" (no effects) from the command line I am able to run sessions over an ssh connection but I rather use the \"Ubuntu classic desktop (no effects)\" version on Ubuntu 11.04 instead of the new Unity since I don't have 3d support on the laptop I'm using to display the graphical User Interface.  How can I startup the older gnome-session without the 3d effects?  I tried gnome-session but it seems to be the option with the 3d effects and I want a more stripped down session over my ssh session.\n\nA: From the command line the GNOME Classic Desktop is started with:\ngnome-session --session=gnome-classic\n\nOther session types are installed by default in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ and can also be opened with the gnome-session --session=SESSION command where SESSION is the name of the SESSION.session file stored.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make sure that any file created in a specific folder has a certain group as owner?

I've been shutting down and restarting the server, but is there something short of that you can do to quickly recover from a high-paging situation?\n\nA: Prevention is better than cure, so you should try to avoid such situations in the first place. If the problem is caused by uncontrolled growth of memory usage (eg. memory leaks) you could setup Monit to restart the monitored process once it exceeds a certain memory limit. If the traffic is spiky, you might consider throttling the number of requests. It's always better to handle less requests with reasonable performance instead of trying to serve everybody but extremely slowly.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no quick way if the system is paging a lot. If you are still able to access the system you can try to kill the most memory consuming processes.\nps -e -o rss=,pid=,comm= | sort -n\n\nwill give you an idea on memory consumption. First column shows the resident set size, second the pid of the process and third the command executed.\nBe patient and try to end the process by\nkill -15 <pid>\n\nIf this does not work any more, try a\nkill -9 <pid>\n\n", "Q: Is there a non-web based application for calling in GTalk?

For example, the vertical scrollbars are supposed to be on the left, but they are on the right. The scrollbar arrows are together (Mac-like) as specified, so is the scrollbar width.\nThe first instance obeys all customizations with scrollbars on the left. Any ideas?\n\nA: Something very strange is going on. First of all, the problem was solved by syncing both profiles. A simple rsync -avz <old_profile_dir> <new_profile_dir> does the trick.\nBut it still doesn't explain why this was happening. As far as I know, I haven't installed any extensions or themes to tweak Firefox. Now for something much more interesting:\nCheck this screenshot of Gmail before syncing the profiles. Notice that the scrollbar is on the right. At the top right, it displays \"xxx@gmail.com\" and the labs icon, settings, etc. On the top left, the menu is black and underlined.\nNow see this screenshot of Gmail after syncing the profiles. Not only is the vertical scrollbar on the left, but more interestingly, the Gmail UI is totally different. On the top right it displays the name \"XXX XXX\" rather than \"xxx@gmail.com\", and everything else goes under the \"wheel\". Clicking on the wheel opens up mail settings, account settings, etc. On the top left, the menu is bigger and bolder blue, with no underlines. Overall font size is 1-2 points larger.\nSo what is this mystery? Why does the Gmail UI change? Why are the scrollbars on the left?\n", "Q: Why does my Messaging Menu code not work when split into functions? Below are two python programs.

Do not source .profile from .bashrc.\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles\n\nA: Look in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc for programs that might be getting \"stuck\" (or, perhaps more likely, waiting for you to type something; beware of things like grep with missing file arguments).  If necessary, you can add set -x at the top of either so the shell shows you what it's running before it runs it.\n\nA: Have you been editing your .bashrc (or similar files) recently? Stuff in there will execute before the prompt appears. The fact you can kill whatever is going on by pressing Ctrl-C suggests something is running.\nI would suggest opening your home folder in the file browser, showing hidden files (Ctrl-H) and sorting by \"Date Modified\". Then look at the newer files. If there are any recently changed with a name like .bashxyz or .bash_xyz then you could rename them and try restarting the terminal again. A new version of the file will be generated when you start the terminal. If that fixes it then you can compare the new file and the renamed file for changes.\nOther filenames to look out for are .profile and .inputrc.\nAnother approach would be to start one terminal and (after hitting Ctrl-C) run top in the terminal. Then start a second terminal and see what is running.\n", "Q: Shutdown computer with the remote controller How can I shutdown the computer with the IR controller ? \nIt has many working buttons, which can be used correctly, but the power button doesn't do anything.

Toshiba L300D AMD dual core. This happens only when running Banshee.\n\nA: There are some one-time operations in Banshee that are very CPU-intensive and can last for several seconds, or even minutes depending on the size of your music collection.\nBPM Detection\nDetecting the tempo of a song can be helpful if you want to automatically generate a playlist such as \"Upbeat\" or \"Slow and Relaxing.\" The downside is, running beat detection on a large library can max out your processor for a sustained period of time.  Also, I've never found beat detection to be terribly accurate (has problems with subdivisions of beats).\nBPM Detection can be disabled under Edit > Preferences > Source Specific. In the Music preferences, make sure \"Automatically detect BPM for all songs\" is not checked.\nMirage Similarity Engine\nThis is a plugin, so it shouldn't be installed unless you made a special point of installing it.  It's great for creating automatically generated playlists of songs that sound similar to each other, but similar to BPM Detection, it will do a one-time analysis of your music library that can be very taxing for your CPU. You can disable the extension in Edit > Preferences > Extensions.\nLibrary Watcher bug\nA few people are experiencing a Library Watcher bug That causes high CPU usage and extremely high memory consumption. You may want to try disabling the Library Watcher extension in Edit > Preferences > Extensions.\nThe spinning throbber\nIn Banshee's lower left corner, a spinning throbber will appear when Banshee is working on something like downloading cover art or syncing a device. If BPM detection and Mirage analysis weren't the source of your high CPU usage, I'd look for the throbber.  If it's there,  you can hover over it to see what Banshee is working on.\nPlayback CPU Bug\nFor some people (myself included), Banshee's CPU usage during playback is high compared to other gstreamer-based media players. The comments in that bug report seem to suggest that Banshee uses 20-25%, which is more than Totem at <10%. Disabling 'Write metadata to files' in Edit > Preferences might help fix this problem, but 25% CPU shouldn't be enough to cause your laptop to overheat unless it has extremely poor ventilation.\nIf none of these things fix the problem, I'd open up Gnome System Monitor and watch the CPU usage of the banshee-1 process to see if it's doing anything crazy.  If it seems abnormally high and it isn't one of the issues I listed, you may need to file a new bug report. Good luck, and let us know if anything works!\n\nA: The fan on the toshiba l300d does not work properley under Ubuntu in most cases, causing the computer to overheat, and sometimes shutdown unexpectadly. I have had this problem with ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, and currently 10.10. I haven't tried 11.04 yet, but i suspect the issue is still unresolved.  Two things have worked for me.\nIn terminal: gksu gedit /etc/default/grub, then in the edit the line: \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" \n\nto read: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\" and run: sudo update-grub and restart. \nThis should get the fan running from startup, but the function keys won't work (can't adjust brightness and stuff).\nIf you want the function keys to work you can do this by editing the same line in /etc/default/grub to read: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux\" the down side of this command is that in order to get the fan to work, each time you start up laptop, you need to press fn+f3 to suspend and then resume the computer. \nThese are the only work arounds I know. they work in ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10\n", "Q: How To Create a Personal VM Server I have a personal Ubuntu server at home for my various personal development needs. I often spend time to configure it for various purposes e.g. for serving a blog or my mercurial repositories etc. However, I am getting very interested in pre-packaged linux appliances available e.g. TurnKey linux etc. It takes no effort to get an appliance up and running!\nI was wondering if I could make my home server into VM server, where I can run multiple VMs for various needs. The server does not have a screen, hence I would like to be able to manage my VMs from the web or console\nI guess in short, I am asking if its possible to have my own personal, light weight Amazon EC2. If yes, how can I set it up? Is there an Ubuntu derived distro available for this? OR can I install a couple of packages and get this running?\n\nA: Great question. \nThere is currently an on-going community effort to create what is currently dubbed as TurnKey master server. In a nutshell it aims to provide exactly what you are looking for, but nothing official has yet been released - we are still in experimentation mode.\nSeveral community developers are exploring different technologies, such as Proxmox OpenVZ and PHPVirtualBox (alpha-testing TKLPatch and ISO's available).\nIt would be great to get feedback and ideas if you have them.\n\nA: You might like Vagrant. It's a Ruby app that uses Virtualbox and Chef to make it easy to create per project VMs. This may sound confusing but check out the site and the getting started video. I've \"discovered\" it recently and it has become one of my favourite applications.\n\nA: Another Free alternative would be PHPVirtualBox \nIts great for monitoring, deploying, creating, managing, and performing maintenance on virtual machines backed by VirtualBox.\nNot many people are aware that Virtualbox comes prepackaged with a web-SOAP style server VBoxWebSrv. This will accept client connections and provides yet another interface to run your VM Server. You're not tethered to the GUI that comes with the default install.\n\nA: Check out proxmox.\nhttp://www.proxmox.com/\nA real alternative to VMware ESX \n\nA: put Xenserver on your hardware and then run any OS in VMs on it. You are only limited by the RAM your server has!\nXenServer is a Hypervisor OS. You can install it on your hardware. Once installed, you control it with a console application(browse to the ip of this server to download) This will then allow you to create new Virtual Machines on the Server using predefined templates or download and deploy virtual appliances. The nice thing about a hypervisor is that you are not limited to ubuntu or linux virtual appliances. This can be a good setup for a lab.\n", "Q: What is Namoroka, and should I have it instead of Minefield or Firefox 4?

While I'm using it for my day to day browsing its safe to keep your Namoroka install until 4.0 reaches its release date\nMinefield was/is the name of the nightly build of FireFox 4. A little snippet about Firefox Minefield:\n\nWARNING: THIS IS NOT A FINAL VERSION OF FIREFOX. This program is provided without any guarantees of stability and you should back up your profile regularly as there may be bugs that corrupt your data. If that sounds scary, please use the latest version of Firefox.\n\nWhat this should mean to you, is unless you're willing to deal with breaking changes, constantly, dont run minefield.

Nouveau can be reinstalled with sudo apt-get reinstall xserver-xorg-video-nouveau.

Is there any script to migrate users /etc/passwd and groups /etc/group along with password /etc/shadow from one server to another? \n\nA: These files are actually just plain-text files.  You can really move them, copy and paste them, or back them up any way you wish between the systems.\nIn addition, you might consider some kind of versioning.\nA tool like etckeeper \n is designed for this.\napt-cache show etckeeper :\nThe etckeeper program is a tool to let /etc be stored in a git, mercurial,\nbzr or darcs repository.\nIt hooks into APT to automatically commit changes made to /etc during \npackage upgrades. \nIt tracks file metadata that version  control systems do not normally support, \nbut that is important for /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow. \nIt's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you \nunderstand the basics of working with version control.\n\nIf you want to make a simple backup, just use tar. \n\n\n*\n\n*cd /etc\n\n*tar cvfz myfiles.tgz shadow passwd group\nTo restore the files, just use tar with 'x' instead of 'c'  :\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /etc\n\n*tar xvfz myfiles.tgz\nThere should be no change in the hash algorithm between these releases.  The system doesn't 'know' your passwords, -- they are calculated as matching or not matching by running the user input through a one-way digest algorithm and comparing the output to the hash in /etc/shadow. It's even conceivable that more than one input will match the stored hash, but you can't go back the other way, so as far as I know, scripting a password export is not possible.  \nIt appears that SHA-512 has been the standard since glibc 2.7, so Ubuntu 8.10 and 10.04 should be completely compatible in this respect. \n", "Q: Why do two pc's show up on my account when I  only own one? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDuplicated entries in Ubuntu One \n\nWhen I look at my account, it shows that two computers are connected to my account.

It requires changes in the code of Unity 2D.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu Precise, and the following did it for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" (not sure if it's installed by default)\n\n*Select \"Desktop Wall\" under Desktop\n\n*Disable \"Show Viewport Switcher Preview\"\n\n*Select the \"Viewport Switching\" tab\n\n*Set \"Wall Sliding Duration\" to zero\n\n\nNow when switching desktops via the keyboard, I don't get any animations.\n\nA: Install dconf-tools  (should be available in Maverick, it definitely is in Natty. I'm on Lucid so I can't check). Open dconf-editor and search for unity. There are several tunables, though I'm not sure the workspace animation is one of them.\n\nA: Probably the best solution is to log in with the \"Classic Gnome Desktop\" (drop-down menu is at the bottom of the GDM Greeter after selecting your username). This will avoid Unity completely.\n", "Q: How can I get the GPS receiver BU-353 working on Ubuntu? I have a GPS receiver BU-353 with USB interface and I'm trying to get it working under Ubuntu.\nI ran gpsd -n -N -D 2 /dev/ttyUSB0, and got this output:\ngpsd: launching (Version 2.94)\ngpsd: listening on port gpsd\ngpsd: running with effective group ID 1000\ngpsd: running with effective user ID 1000\ngpsd: opening GPS data source type 3 at '/dev/ttyUSB0'\ngpsd: speed 38400, 8N1\ngpsd: Garmin: garmin_gps Linux USB module not active.\ngpsd: speed 9600, 8O1\ngpsd: speed 38400, 8N1\ngpsd: gpsd_activate(): opened GPS (fd 6)\ngpsd: speed 4800, 8N1\ngpsd: NTPD ntpd_link_activate: 0\ngpsd: /dev/ttyUSB0 identified as type SiRF binary (2.687608 sec @ 4800bps)\ngpsd: detaching 127.0.0.1 (sub 1, fd 8) in detach_client\ngpsd: detaching 127.0.0.1 (sub 1, fd 8) in detach_client\n\nAfter this I started tangoGPS, which said no GPS and no GPSD found.\n\nA: BU-353 is known to work with gpsd.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try the -b flag (for example, gpsd -b /dev/ttyUSB0)\n\n*Open a separate terminal window and run gpsmon (included in the 'gpsd-clients' package) to check gpsd output. Restart gpsmon each time you restart gpsd.\nCould tango be starting too soon? The dongle requires a few seconds to sort out the signals, identify satellites, and calculate a fix; udev requires a few seconds to start gpsd, which in turn requires a few seconds to probe the dongle (which may not be ready yet) and begin broadcasting useful information when the data stream finally begins. gpsmon can help diagnose that problem, too.\n\n*If there's no gpsd output, then do a more detailed check. Do the following steps in order to test the dongle, the kernel module, the mount, the device node, and gpsd:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the USB dongle and kill gpsd (sudo pkill gpsd). Wait 10 seconds for /dev/ttyUSB0 to be freed.\n\n*Plug the USB dongle back in and wait 10 seconds.\n\n*Check dmesg | tail -n 5 to verify the dongle was really mounted to /dev/ttyUSB0. If it doesn't mount, then you're missing a kernel module (from your description, that's unlikely). Sometimes it gets mounted to /dev/ttyUSB1 if 0 isn't free!\n\n*See if udev recognized the dongle and started gpsd (ps -e | grep gpsd). If not, then you have a udev rules issue, and you must start gpsd manually with gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0\n\n*Once gpsd is running, check for dongle output (dongle output = gpsd input). Try cat /dev/ttyUSB0 (stop it with CTRL+c). If that fails, then try resetting the baud rate to 4800:\npkill gpsd\nstty 4800 > /dev/ttyUSB0\ngpsd -b /dev/ttyUSB0\ncat /dev/ttyUSB0     # CTRL+c to stop\n\n\n*If you have have good dongle output (=gpsd input), open a second terminal window and try either gpsmon or cgps to test gpsd output.\n\n*Finally, now that you have good dongle output and good gpsd output, try tangoGPS.\n\n\n\nA: I was having a similar problem. I did everything here and still couldn't get it to work in openCPN. I stumbled on to another forum that said to try changing the default settings for gpsd at /etc/default/gpsd to this.\n# Default settings for the gpsd init script and the hotplug wrapper.\n\n# Start the gpsd daemon automatically at boot time\nSTART_DAEMON=\"false\"\n\n# Use USB hotplugging to add new USB devices automatically to the daemon\nUSBAUTO=\"true\"\n\n# Devices gpsd should collect to at boot time.\n# They need to be read/writeable, either by user gpsd or the group dialout.\nDEVICES=\"/dev/ttyUSB0\"\n\n# Other options you want to pass to gpsd\nGPSD_OPTIONS=\"-n -G -b\"\nGPSD_SOCKET=\"/var/run/gpsd.sock\"\n#end of file gpsd\n\nto my surprise it worked.\n", "Q: How should I partition my Ubuntu 10.10 install? I have about 12-15 GBs of disk space on which I am about to install Ubuntu 10.10.\nI am considering following partitioning scheme:\n14GB partition with 10GB root, 2GB swap (I have 4GB RAM) & 2GB home\nPeople say to keep a partition /home, as it will have backup of my user setting and useful when i upgrade, is that correct?\nKindly guide me if this is okay, or suggest a different partitioning scheme.\nThanks.\n\nA: Mostly partitioning will depend upon what you like to do with your system. However I am attempting to answer  assuming typical use.\nYes, keeping /home as a separate partition will help you to retain all personal data even when you do a wipe out re-install of OS with same version or higher version. (Such re-install  is recommended than upgrade). If you want further granular control you can create more partitions based on need.\nGenerally you will not have more than 2-4 GB of data (it can vary based on what you install, but if you use default logrotate to keep logs cleared and do not use system for ever growing data like databases)  in root if you are keeping only two partitions namely /home and /root. \nThis assumes all your personal files goes to /home. So probably keeping ~6 GB to root , at-least same size as of RAM as swap (only if you expect any possibility of 100% memory usage) and rest of space for /home will be ideal. Also note that all personal files goes to /home by default, /home likely to grow over time.\n", "Q: wireless network won't connect automatically wireless network worked fine first time i set it up but when i rebooted it wouldnt start automatically. note that i used \"sudo pppoeconf\" to connect to my service provider\n\nA: Try this, Right click on the network icon -> edit connection -> click wireless tab -> click on your wireless name -> click on edit on the right side, make sure to check connect automatically checkbox \n\n", "Q: Copy paste buffer configuration best practices There are two copy/paste buffers in Ubuntu: \n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+c, ctrl+v  and  alt+ins, shift+ins\n\n*Mouse select and click on selected text. These buffers often appear to get mixed up, and the second buffer doesn't work in some applications and circumstances. I'm pretty new to Ubuntu. What are the best practices for configuring these buffers?\n\n\nA: Autocutsel (available in repositories) keeps the clipboard and cutbuffer in sync. \nYou can add it to the startup apps or to your .bashrc file.\nIt works well for me.\n\nA: I use parcellite  - a \"lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager\".

The live USB is self-contained within the persistence file - when you install Ubuntu, there's no option to migrate those settings into your clean install.\nFor example, my Live CD with persistence has an install of clamAV, and panel applets to show CPU, frequency and temperature.  It's also connected to my WIFI.  However, when I use that key to install, I get the stock install - no clamAV, none of my customised panel applets, and I have to re-connect to my WIFI.\nSorry.\nWith regards to your first question - your customisations on the Live USB will remain in place when you use that Live USB, regardless of which PC you run it on.\n\nA: No, the Live USB will only be customized on itself. When you install to a pc you're writing to the computer from the actual ISO image and it's files...there will be no customization until you customize it again. \n", "Q: Bluetooth and card reader not working on Acer Aspire 255 I have installed ubuntu 10.10 on a new aspire d255 with atom N550 with 2.6.37 kernel that i had to install in order to use the inbuilt card reader.\nThere is another issue: I am not able to make  bluetooth connection.

Change preferred resolution in System -> Preferences -> Monitor. \n\nA: I'm using a Radeon HD5850, so it isn't exactly the same card, but your experiences should be similar.\nIn older versions of Ubuntu, the open drivers were not very good and you almost had to use the proprietary drivers. In 11.04, there were great improvements to the open drivers, but there were still a few issues with Unity, although they were minor. In 11.10, there is no doubt that I prefer the open drivers. They're faster, more stable and makes things easier in general. \nIn other words, unless you have very good reasons not to, I would strongly encourage you to check out the newest versions of Ubuntu and see if the problems just go away. \n\nA: to ask your question a single command is enough\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nwith this your xorg.conf is properly written, it's ok and fully working.\nBut, if i can suggest you something better than the driver you are actually using, install the proprietary driver from the official website ( first remove the one you have installed from the official repository and every fglrx-related packages ) maybe you can follow the instructions at this page http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Main_Page .\nThere is nothing wrong with the fglrx package from the official repository but it's really outdated and sometimes the latest driver from the official website works better.\nI have an XFX XXX 5770 1Gb and everything works like a charm with the latest driver.\n", "Q: When will Natty dailies have final 2.6.38 kernel in them?

I'm very excited by the functional design principles and keyboard shortcuts that are being implemented for Unity. And function of use is more important to me than looks. However, after experiencing the aesthetic beauty of the display of the top panel in gnome-shell, I was wondering if users would be able to alter the color of Unity's top panel? \nIMHO it does not look as good as the gnome-shell implementation (or mac OS X/iPad). I think if an alternate color/appearance were chosen for the panel, it would make a big difference aesthetically.\nIs there a way to make it Black like gnome-shell? Or are the color choices limited to theme-designs as pointed out in this answer?\nFor efficiency and clarity, the Panel should be better differentiated from application controls. The panel should be a different color because it has a \"constant (always present) state,\" unlike application controls. For contrast and easy-recognition, I would like to make the Panel black (like gnome-shell) but make the application controls (e.g., those of Firefox) \"Inverted\" \n\nA: Yes, The color of the panel changes as per the gtk theme.\n\n\nA: To add to the above, you can set the level of transparency yourself as well.\n", "Q: Cannot use apt-get anymore because of one specific package No matter what type of apt-get I run (install, update, ...)

The easiest way to correct that is by rebooting with the command shutdown -F -r now, and subsequently watching the show.\nThe automated check will correct any errors it can without destroying data (for example, it will clean up files that have been deleted, but where the space has not been freed yet), but if it needs a decision, it will refuse and ask for the administrator to correct the problem manually, which is sort of an art in itself and more complex than I can explain here (it may be a sign of a problem with the harddisk, identifying this takes some experience though).\nThe dpkg error can be corrected by reinstalling the package, ideally in the exact same version (the files list is just a list of all files that were inside the package when it was unpacked, so using the same or a sufficiently similar version of the package will give the same list).\nThat dpkg hangs at this point is definitely wrong and also screams \"filesystem issue\" to me.\n\nA: If you want to check if the sources.list is empty (because you expect it to be?) check the file sources.list with\ncat /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIf you see url's with your distro name at the end you will probably have the right sources.list content.

(By \"external access\", I mean eg. via a Live CD, or another OS on the same dual-boot machine)  \nA friend wants to try Ubuntu. He's fed up with Vista grinding to a crawl (the kids? :), so he likes the \"potential\" security offered by Ubuntu, but because the computer will be multi-booting Ubuntu (primary) and 2 Vistas (one for him, if he ever needs it again, and the other one for the kids to screw up (again).  \nHowever, he is concerned about any non-Ubuntu access to the Ubuntu partitions (and also to his Vista partition)...  \nI believe TrueCrypt will do the job for his Vista, but I'd like to know what the best encryption system for Ubuntu is... If TrueCrypt works for Ubuntu, it may be the best option for him, as it would be the same look and feel for both.  \nUbuntu will be installed with 3 partitions; 1) root 2) home 3) swap..  \nWill Ubuntu's boot loader clash with TrueCrypt's encrypted partition? \nPS.. Is encryption a suitable solution?\n\nA: Truecrypt is not the solution for an encrypted Ubuntu system, LUKS is the Ubuntu solution for disk encryption. You can use the alternative installer CD to enable it on a fresh install.\nNote that an encrypted partition can still be destroyed, the encryption prevents unauthorized access to files, but does not protect it from being damaged.

I have ubuntu installed on my local computer with apache / php / mysql.\nI now have a directory at /var/www - inside which I have several of my ongoing projects. I also work with opensource ( drupal, magento, sugarcrm ).\nThe problem I am facing is changing file permission with terminal. Sometime I need to change the permission of entire folder and its subsequent sub-folders and files. I have to individually change using \nsudo chmod 777 foldername\n\nHow can I do this recursively.\nAlso why do I have to always do it 777, I tried 755 for folders and 644 for files, but that won't work.\n\nA: You can change the subfolders and files on Nautilus. As you can see on the image below. In order to have the permissons on buttons, you can enable the option on Ubuntu Tweak.\n\n\nA: You should not need 777 for anything. Worst case, you'll need to change the owner of certain files and directories to the \"www-data\" user.\nsudo find /var/www -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755\nsudo find /var/www -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 644\nsudo find /var/www/some/subset -print0 | xargs -0 chown www-data:www-data\n\nIf you're using Lekensteyn's group membership method, change 755 to 775 and 644 to 664 respectively above, and then force the group stickiness:\nsudo find /var/www/some/subset -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod g+s\n\n\nA: bruteforce:\nsudo find foldername -exec chmod a+rwx {} \";\"\n\nWhat does not work? Be more specific!\nsudo find foldername -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \";\"\nsudo find foldername -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \";\"\n\n\nA: Just add the -R option to recursively change the permissions of files. An example, recursively add read and write permissions for the owner and group on foldername:\nchmod -R ug+rw foldername\n\nPermissions will be like 664 or 775.\nSetting the permissions to 777 is highly discouraged. You get errors in either Apache or your editor regarding permissions because apache runs under a different user (www-data) than you.\nIf you want to write to /var/www, add yourself to the www-data group and set umask+permissions accordingly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add yourself to the www-data group: sudo adduser $USER www-data\n\n*Change the ownership of the files in /var/www: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www\n\n*Change the umask, so newly created files by Apache grants write permissions to the group too. Add umask 007 to /etc/apache2/envvars.\n\n*Grant yourself (technically, the group www-data) write permissions: sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www.\n\n\nA: If you want to have all of your files be readable to the world (ie. it's just a static set of HTML files/images), then use this command:\nchmod -R a+r <base directory>\n\nThat will recursively go through all of the files & subdirectories and add read permission to them.  \nWARNING: Don't do this for files that are executable!

I'm not a photographer, so this confusion may simply be a result of my ignorance, but I thought RAW images were unprocessed photographs, in which case two editors would be kinda redundant. Am I simply missing one of the finer details of photograph processing?\n\nA: You are correct about RAW files being unprocessed shots.  In fact, they're so unprocessed that the files are not even JPEG files.  Thus RAWs are typically converted to JPEG.  For this, you would typically use a RAW Editor.  A RAW editor usually does things like handle tint, exposure, things like that, which can be best tweaked before it converts to JPEG.  This is the basic task of a RAW editor, such as UFRaw or Rawstudio.  They give you control over the way the data from your camera's sensor becomes that JPEG file.\nAn external photo editor on the other hand would be a program typically for editing regular JPEG files, and usually offers a lot more things you can do to the photograph, such as airbrushing etc.\nSo why are some types of things expected to be done to RAW files while others are reserved for JPEG?  Well, I don't have a good reason, except that's the way it's always been done.  Programmatically, the task of converting to JPEG is quite different from the task of editing the contents of the image, even though an average person such as yourself would see the two tasks as essentially the same.  Personally, I would love to see a program that let you edit RAW files as if you were editing a JPEG, and allow you when finished to save the finished product as a JPEG.\n\nA: UFRaw is an alternative to open and modify .NEF files (raw photos) using Gimp.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Software Centre and type UFRaw, install it\n\n*open the file with UFRaw\n\n*You will find GIMP's icon (fox) at the very bottom right, click on it and done, you can work your raw photo out.\n\n", "Q: Allocating drive space? I'm trying to install ubuntu but i already have windows 7 on the same computer and i can't afford losing it. \neverything went perfectly well until allocating drivespace. i dont have the option to \"install it besides another operating system \" like in the instructions. i only get this menu when my external hard disk is plugged in, but i dont want that.\nany help assigning partitions? because i have no clue about what to do there\nthis is what the partition menu gives\n\nA: If your entire disk is already devoted to your windows partition, re-partitioning that drive is risky at best.  For me, the ideal way has always been to install side-by-side is to install windows first, but specify that the partition that is created only takes up half the drive or whatever.  Then when you install ubuntu, you install it in the unpartitioned space left over.\nThe safest thing if you're worried about your existing data and install, is to use Wubi.  This allows you to install ubuntu directly to your windows partition, but in a way that makes it look to Ubuntu that it's in its own partition.  It's pretty cool, but the drawback is supposedly that disk access would be slower, hence Ubuntu would appear slower.  Personally, I haven't noticed that much of a difference, but I'm sure it's there.\nEither way, backups are highly recommended before you proceed.\n\nA: To answer more Allocating drive space?, you will need to provide how many windows partitions are there.\nRefer this documentation on disk partitioning. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoResizeWindowsPartitions\nRefer to the section which says how to resize from windows 7 and try that. Else, report the number of partition reported as per 'Settings -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Storage -> Disk Management' in windows 7 and type of these partitions (meaning primary vs extended or any other type).\nThe reasons would be more likely,\nMaximum possible primary partitions that is 4 primary partitions are already defined and allocated for windows. I see this in many MNC brand laptops and it is a very poor partitioning scheme. In that case, you will need to delete one of such primary partition and create an  extended partition. You can shrink another existing partition as well and add to this free space if you are able to get contiguous space. Once you have extended partitions/free space created, Ubuntu install will show optin to install along side with windows 7. \nThere are other possibilities, but probably hearing from you more on your current windows 7 partition types and number of partitions can help if we need to discus those options.\n", "Q: Purging unused Ubuntu partition I installed Ubuntu, on my work PC, a couple a years ago(2007?) on a separate partition.

Does GRUB stop working?\n\nA: Your question indicates you no longer need Ubuntu on this machine and that space will be reclaimed for the use of windows XP.\nYou can eliminate the partitons from windows XP itself. As a precaution, take a backup of windows data before doing the steps.\nGo to 'Settings -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Storage -> Disk Management' from windows xp and simply delete and reformat the ext2/3/4 partitions which will be Linux partitions and create and format new windows partitions.\nI assume the primary partition is windows XP and it is the one with boot flag.\nNow you will need to fix MBR to remove grub and re-instate pure windows XP MBR.\nRefer http://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/fix-mbr-xp-vista/ (I personally did not use this in the past, but after reading it and remembering my past experience this documentation looks correct).\nNow you should have PC without old Ubuntu. \n\nA: Grub will not stop working if it's installed on your primary partition(your xp). \n", "Q: What keyboard layout allows me to type ç?

To illustrate the problem, here is the definition (empty lines and comments are left out):\nstart on runlevel [0123456]\nstop on runlevel [!$RUNLEVEL]\nexport RUNLEVEL\nexport PREVLEVEL\nconsole output\nenv INIT_VERBOSE\ntask\nexec /etc/init.d/rc $RUNLEVEL\n\nLet's suppose we currently are in runlevel 2 and the rc job is stopped (that is exactly the situation after booting my box and logging in via SSH). Now, let's assume that the system switches to runlevel 3, for example due to a command like \"telinit 3\" given by root. What will happen to the rc job?\nObviously, the rc job will be started since it is currently stopped and the event runlevel 3 is matching the start events. But from now on, things are unclear to me: According to the manual $RUNLEVEL evaluates to the new runlevel when the job is started (that means 3 in our example).\nTherefore, the next stanza \"stop on runlevel [!$RUNLEVEL]\" translates to \"stop on runlevel [!3]\"; that means we have a first stanza which will trigger the job, but the second stanza will never stop the job and seems to be useless.\nSince I know that the Ubuntu / Upstart people won't do useless things, I must be heavily misunderstanding something. I would be grateful for any explanation.\nWhile trying to understand this, an additional question came to my mind. If I had contradicting start and stop triggers, for example\nstart on foo\nstop on foo\n\nwhat would happen? I swear I never will do that, but I am nevertheless very interested in how Upstart handles that on the theoretical level.\nThank you very much!\n\nEditing the question as a reaction on geekosaur's first answer:\nI can see the parallelism, but it is not that easy (at least, not to me).\nLet's assume the job aurrently is still running, and a new runlevel event comes in (of course, the new runlevel is different from the current one). Then, the following should happen:\n1) The job is single instance. That means that \"start on ...\" won't be triggered since the job is currently running; $RUNLEVEL is not touched.\n2) \"stop on ...\" will be triggered since the new runlevel is different from $RUNLEVEL, so the job will be aborted.\n3) Now, the job is stopped and waiting. I can't see how it is restarted with the new runlevel. AFAIK, initctl emits events only once, so \"start on ...\" won't be triggered and the new runlevel won't be entered.\nI know that I still misunderstanding something, and I am grateful for explanations.\nThank you very much!\n\nA: The order of operations is very carefully maintained in upstart when processing events. Stops caused by an event are always done before starts. While linux is multi-process, upstart's event engine is not.\nSo, the runlevel command, which emits the 'runlevel' event, is received by the upstart state engine, and then processed by first doing all transitions from start to stop completely. This will block until the first rc is killed and dead. Then the transitions from stop to start are done, and the new rc job is started.\nThis is actually documented in the upstart source code:\n    /* We stop first so that if an event is listed both as a\n     * stop and start event, it causes an active running process\n     * to be killed, the stop script then the start script to be\n     * run.  In any other state, it has no special effect.\n     *\n     * (The other way around would be just strange, it'd cause\n     * a process's start and stop scripts to be run without the\n     * actual process).\n     */\n\nThis probably belongs in the upstart cookbook, so I've opened a wishlist bug against it here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart-cookbook/+bug/745096\n\nA: We have now documented (hopefully) clearly how the \"rc\" job works in Ubuntu in the Upstart Cookbook.

Same answer applies to the first part of your question, it's used to abort the runlevel startup if the user switches to another runlevel before it's finished.\nI have no idea about the second part, though.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts not working after removing Shutter I installed Shutter then removed it, and now Print Screen and Alt+Print Screen shortcuts are no longer triggering screenshots with gnome-screenshot.

If you can link me to a howto that does exactly what I'm looking for, that would work. \n\nA: Ideally, you should have some level of experience in SQL coding if you want to hand code. This means you first get mysql-server (click-to-install)\nFor the most basic sql commands, you would need to install mysql-client as well. After that open a terminal and run mysql -u username -p for running mysql cli. Take a look at mysql documentation for learning mysql.\nAccording to the open-office wiki, Openoffice Base is also integratable with mysql. Take a look here for more instructions. There are other mysql-gui tools available for ubuntu, the most recommended being Squirrelsql. For the export part to csv, I believe Openoffice should be capable of that (I have no experience of using Base)\nIn case you would like a web based interface, I would recommend phpmyadmin and sqlbuddy as two possible options. They can connect to external servers as well. So you can run them on other machines as well\n\nA: (1)  sudo apt-get install mysql-server in the terminal.  That should set it up.  It'll give you various prompts for the setup process.\n(2) If you need to be able to access this from a different system (and not from the machine you install it on), do this.  After the config, go find /etc/mysql/my.cnf.  Locate any line saying skip-networking.  Modify the line to say #skip-networking.  if you do this step, make sure you do sudo service mysql restart in terminal before continuing!\n(3)  You will need experience with SQL code to be able to use the system, but all the information you need can be found on the mysql site: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/\n\nA: I found installing as a complete package from  http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html#374  save LOTS of headaches.  This will set up apache, mysql, and php.  \n", "Q: What's the effect of Ubuntu upgrade on the session configurations? If I upgrade through update-manager, will my current Gnome 'classic' session be reset to the default panel configuration, or will the system keep the current layout? Is a backup preferable?\n\nA: Upgrades usually keep your settings. It's nice to backup just in case, but your settings are reused wherever possible.\n", "Q: Chromium: Anti Ad Plugin(s)/Addon(s)? I've got Chromium installed from their PPA.  Is there anywhere that various addons or plugins for anti-advertising and similar functionality are listed, so that I can add the addons to my installation?\n\nA: Blocking ads\nAdblock Plus, of Firefox fame, now has an extension for Chrome: http://adblockplus.org/\nHowever, it took them a long time to start the (still incomplete) project, and this guy wrote his own extension: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom\nBlocking advertisers\nA step further is the Ghostery extension. It blocks tracker scripts and the like. I use a fairly under-powered laptop to browse the web, and Ghostery cuts page load times in half.\nSalon.com runs at least twelve third-party scripts on its front page. Some of them track how you use the site. Salon might use the data to improve the site, or they might sell your browser history to someone else, or both. Others are widgets from social networks like Facebook and Reddit, allowing both easy sharing and easy tracking. The Disqus script handles Salon's comments. On its highest settings, Ghostery blocks it all: trackers, comments, whatever.\nAngiesList, on its login page, runs over twelve third-party scripts. Ghostery identifies every single one as an advertiser tracking and selling your browsing information. I forget which, but one of them also handles the actual logging in. On its highest setting, Ghostery prevents logging in to AngiesList. Fortunately, it's easy to disable temporarily. (but I do worry: is angieslist sharing my username and password with other companies??)\nDisconnect.me is similar to Ghostery, but is open source.\n", "Q: 'unknown filesystem' grub rescue prompt; trying to wipe drive and boot 10.10 live Im currently running Win7, and want to wipe the drive and install 10.10.\nI have 10.10 loaded on a USB thumbdrive and it sees the device in BIOS but it only reaches a screen saying;\nUnknown Filesystem\ngrub rescue>\n\nIve read several results from google and a couple here where people are trying to dual boot and i assume save the data on the drive, but i dont care about doing that, and would prefer to just wipe the drive and start fresh.\nWhat steps can i take to get the drive to a point where i can load 10.10 live and get it installed?\n\nA: None of the common automated tools for creating an Ubuntu LiveUSB use grub2 (instead they use syslinux) so your immediate and likely only problem is that you're not actually booting from the Ubuntu LiveUSB but from a different drive (likely your internal hard drive).\nMake sure that the USB drive is first in the boot order in your BIOS.\n", "Q: download packages from ppa.launchpad.net via ftp or https I would like to ask if it is possible to update/upgrade packages through ftp. \nIt means accessing ppa.launchpad.net via ftp/https. Or does launchpad.net have mirrors?\nI know that I can download package through https://launchpadlibrarian.net and I can upload package into launchpad.net via ftp.\n\nA: Update:\nHTTP / HTTPS:\nAfter checking with the Launchpad channel on IRC, only private PPAs get HTTPS, under the current system.  Public PPAs do not get HTTPS connectivity methods.\nManual Downloading Method:\nYour only other option in this case to get PPA packages via HTTPS for public PPAs, here, would be to manually download the packages off of Launchpad (via Launchpad Librarian), by navigating to the PPA on the Launchpad interface, hit the \"View package details\" section, expand the given package version, and manually downloading all the .deb files from Launchpad, which will use HTTPS.  This, however, \nFTP / SFTP / FTPS:\nNone of the PPAs support FTP/SFTP/FTPS download mechanisms.  You cannot use these methods to download packages from PPAs. (FTP and SFTP are only available for uploading via dput, and are not available for downloads).\n", "Q: Mixing onboard Nvidia and an ATi card, each connect to one monitor I'm using on-board Nvidia 6100. I got an offer to buy a second-hand, cheap, ATi 4350 card. The card only have one VGA output (not DVI/HDMI). My plan is to buy it and a second monitor. So, one monitor will connect to the onboard Nvidia, and another to the ATi card.\nIs it doable? What steps should I prepare?\nThanks in advance.\nEdit: I don't game.\n\nA: I'm running my on board Nvidia card with an ATI quad monitor card for a total of five monitors on a digital audio workstation in Windows 7, and aside from a few quirks (my favorite screensaver Flurry won't run), it seems to be stable.\n\nA: In order to do this, both cards would require crossfire or SLI support.  Typically, onboard cards do not have this, and cheap ATI cards do not either.  So in short, no you cannot do this without the cards having crossfire compatibility or SLI support.\nAssuming they do have the support though, and the BIOS also has the support for it, you should be able to use both cards by configuration in the BIOS, but as to that I cannot help you.\n\nA: I don't think there is any safe way to run 2 different drivers. I really like the ATI HD5450. It looks very nice with Ubuntu (and Windows 7 for that matter) and it has both a DVI and HDMI output. Lowish power consumption and no fan. The best part is that it's only $50.\nNot a gamers card but it will support Compiz just fine.\nOh yes, and when you get the HDMI cable be sure it has the RF Cans on both ends (those big round things). I've had weird problems with cables without them.\n", "Q: How do I access and enable more icons to be in the system tray? So I'm messing around with Natty a little, and I noticed that all the apps that would normally use the system tray (or \"notification area\"?) aren't displaying there. Is that a bug, or is that the way it's going to be? I heard something about Ubuntu getting rid of that feature entirely. Is there a way to add it back? I mean, I didn't really like it, either, especially when there were apps that used it unnecessarily, but I can't use CryptKeeper at all now, or easycrypt, and I don't know whether Dropbox has synced without opening Nautilus. \n\nA: You can upgrade Dropbox, as in the latest builds it has an indicator on Ubuntu.\nFor other applications, if the developers do not add indicator support for them, you can simply white-list them as Alaukik says, and also notify the developer that they need to fix the application.\n\nA: To show the current systray whitelist:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist\nTo whitelist all systray indicators: \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\nTo append an application to the whitelist, substitute MYAPP at the end of this line:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"$(gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist | sed -e \"s/]$/, 'MYAPP']/\")\"\n\nA: From Ubuntu 13.04 onwards you have to whitelist the applications if you want to allow access to the system tray.\nFirstly install dconf-tools from the software center ( or by clicking here)\nThen Press Alt+F2 and enter dconf-editor and run it.\n\nNow navigate to Desktop -> Unity -> Panel. \n\nNow change the value of  systray-whitelist to \n\"all\"\n\nNote that setting this to \"all\" will likely lead to other bugs, as the old notification area is unmaintained, instead consider adding applications you need individually instead of just enabling everything. You can reset it to the defaults by checking out this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set the panel whitelist back to the default?\nDo note that the system tray is entirely removed in 13.04 and newer and that older applications that still have not been ported need to be updated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why aren't certain indicators showing in Unity?\n\nA: In Terminal, copy and paste this command\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\nThe tip comes from this website; \nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/how-to-re-enable-notification-area.html\n\nA: Instead of changing it to 'all' I suggest adding the name of the desired application to the list. With this you avoid all kinds of problems with panel caused by the \"all\" value.\nFor example drweb indicator was missing, so I tried to add the command which executes dr web antivirus into the  whitelist. The value was like ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier']. I changed it to ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'drweb-cc', 'Update-notifier'], then I logged out and logged in, and the indicator was on the panel.\n\nA: The best way, and ubuntu version independent is to run dconf-editor, and find (ctrl+F) this string \"systray-whitelist\" (unless they change it...)\nYou can edit its value to simply ['all'], you can restore it by clicking \"set to default\" button also.\nOr find out what icons you want to show, one by one and add them there.\n", "Q: Why does the \"monospace\" font look great in Terminal and gedit, and terrible in IntelliJ IDEA? Why does the \"monospace\" font look great in Terminal and gedit, and terrible in IntelliJ IDEA?  IDEA uses Java's Swing library, and I understand it might be an issue with this.  Is there a known fix?\n\nA: I have the same problem. Apparently its a problem with the \"hinting\" level of the font, which IntelliJ forces to \"full\" no matter what the OS selects. This makes the fonts look jagged and thin rather than how its supposed to. There was a workaround I saw on a website, but it didn't work for me.\n\nA: Generally, all Java software has poor font rendering under Linux. You’ll see this also under Windows, the fonts look different.

I use my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS instance (via Virtual Box on Windows 7) with a non-root user. I am trying out developing Rails applications and I notice that I need to run some rails commands with sudo. The problem this gives me is some files are created by the root user then, and I cannot edit them via a GNOME window with my logged in user. \nWhat is the correct thing to do here? Should I somehow always login as root? If so how? Is there some way for me to give all files under my home directory (where I do all my Rails work) the correct permissions for all users, so I can edit them with my logged in user via a window? \nAt the moment I have to resort to opening a file via the command line like this sudo gedit myFile.rb - this is not very sustainable!\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: As mentioned by @mount.cifs the ubuntu file permission page, includes tips on settting sticky & SGID bits etc.\nI would suggest routinly change group ownerships and access rights to your folder.\nsudo chgrp -R foobar /home/foo/bar\nsudo chmod -R g+w /home/foo/bar\nOther than that investigating if setting the umask for your session to group writable will solve you problem?\nhttp://bashscript.blogspot.com/2010/03/unixlinux-advanced-file-permissions.html\nhttp://bashscript.blogspot.com/2010/03/creating-user-group-and-shared.html\nPs.

Then again I presume gems have to be installed system wide, so perhaps...\nAnyway what about running a nautilus window as root:\nsudo nautilus /home/foo\nOr use the files sidebar in GEdit for file navigation?\n\nA: Please read following:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nIn general it depends on the situation how to handle owner/file permissions.\n\nA: First, avoid the need to use sudo.  Figure out what your script is accessing that you don't have access to, and change the permissions on that file so you have access without having to resort to sudo.\nIf you can't get around the need for sudo, then after running such a command, just sudo chown the files it creates back to yourself.\n", "Q: How to re-download incomplete podcast downloads in Rhythmbox It seems like Rhythmbox has a bad habit of not downloading some of the podcast files completely: \n\nBut I don't seem to find the option of re-downloading the episode anywhere.

I'm installing via USB so it can't be the CD. the laptop is recent so it cant be an old HD.\n\nA: Either the cd or your hard disk is bad.  You can check the CD with the \"Check disc for defects\" option when you boot it up.  You can check your hard disk by opening Administration->Disk Utility and checking the SMART attributes.  Look for non zero values for reallocated, pending, and offline_uncorrectable sectors.  Then you might want to run the long self test.\n\nA: This problem drove me crazy for 2 weeks on and off. I have finally found out what the problem is and I registered just to share my conclusion to help others because this is a very misleading error to a lot of us.\nI have 2 laptops and I tried to install BackTrack, BackBox, Ubuntu, etc.. all failed on one laptop and I couldn't understand why, I was installing from a live USB and it was still complaining about the CD/DVD error!! what the hell, it does not make any sense.\nI opened up my laptop, I completely removed the CD/DVD and tried again and it still failed.\nI opened up my laptop hoping my final resolution was to just remove a 2GB ram but to my luck, the laptop had just one 4GB RAM stick, so that trick would not work.\nI came to the wrong conclusion that others came to as well and that is perhaps the linux OS is just not compatible with all hardware out there and in my mind I started to blame developers even though I am one.\nWhy this problem is a misleading one? Because:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can go into your bios and detect that you have the correct size of ram (4GB) and also boot windows 7/8 and use it just fine, no problems at all, so why should Linux complain !, also in my case this was a brand new laptop as well.!!\n\n*There is a large number of us users that are actually experiencing this problem, so this could lead to the understanding that it is actually the OS and not our hardware. However, until you restart your machine and go into “Diagnostics” you won’t know that there is actually a problem with your ram, Its much quicker than using memtest to detect if there is indeed an issue.\nThis leads me to believe that linux is actually so good that it does a proper test of the CRC of your ram as it tries to install itself and will fail if there is something wrong with the ram, a bit harsh though.\nHaving said that, linux developers still need to change the error message to help the users understand clearly that there is a ram issue as oppose to a missleading \"CD / DVD error\" but also there should still be a way to bypass the error and continue the installation of the OS because we know that windows can operate just fine on the faulty ram.\nI replaced the faulty RAM and it worked just fine. I really hope this helps people to cut to the chase.\nWhen people are suggesting to remove 1 ram and got it to work, they most definatly removed the faulty ram, its not because it was a trick to remove one and keep the other to fool the OS.\nThanks\n\nA: How I fix this error in a simple way: after opening the Ubuntu CD / DVD install menu, start Ubuntu as Test / Trial, without installing on harddisk. When the O.S. is ready to use, just install the Ubuntu from the icon / shortcut in the menu sidebar or desktop itself.\nHope it works for you!\n\nA: I had the same problem and same error message and trouble-shooted for two days.

Then I read the post above by Will Smith and changed my 2 x 2 GB DDR3 667 to a single 2 GB DDR2 800 and it finally installed all the way without any hiccups. \n\nA: I just had the same problem today. I had inadvertently interrupted an install on my netbook, and it was neither installing nor booting into the OS. I tried using multiple USB drives and multiple *buntu distros to try to circumvent things, which didn't work. I was using the USB installer from pendrivelinux.com, which I've used before and had success with. To be thorough in my troubleshooting, I downloaded the USB installer on another computer, and it still didn't help. Eventually, I tried a Windows USB installer to put a copy of Win7 on, which worked (strangely). I then immediately overwrote Windows with MeeGo, which I'm currently noodling around with.

There you should be able to see more information about the error, note it down or take a photo of the screen\n\n\nA: People in the net seems to have experienced this in the past, which seems to be to a hardware related issue. \nThe majority of the cases points to \"Change the CD (hardware and disc brand)\" and/or \"Change the amount of memory used for the install process (probably a memory bank corrupted or something)\".\nSomehow you can give a try to this and inform us.\nSources:\nhttp://forumubuntusoftware.info/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=3438\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/base-installer/+bug/245794\nGood luck!\n\nA: I find this error both strange and, as any error, annoying. It's happening to me both with Ubuntu and Elementary OS.\nI've tried with several USB Drives and several DVDs. HD right?

Well, I'm on a Pentium 4 HT and apparently all I had to do to get it to install was going into the BIOS and disable the Hyper-threading for the installation. After that, turned it back on and booted fine!\n", "Q: Why doesn't unity dash respect the gnome Main Menu entries? I'm testing out Natty, and one thing I notice is that the custom commands I put in my old main menu don't appear in dash. I click \"Applications\" and what I get is different from the list in the \"Main Menu\" preferences. I'd like to be able to write a custom command and have it launched with Unity Dash, is that possible? \n\nA: Yes, this was due to a bug in Unity. When you get the latest version of the package unity-place-applications (version 0.2.40-0ubuntu1) this should work. The package hit the main archive last night and should be available in local mirrors shortly.\n", "Q: Will Unity have a keyboard shortcut for accessing the \"Session Menu\" that appears on the panel? I noticed in screen shots of Unity the presence of the \"Session Menu\" indicator in the right corner of the top-panel. This menu drops down to offer Log Out, Hibernate, Restart, Shut Down, etc.\nI know the keyboard shortcuts are not complete yet. But are there plans to implement a shortcut for accessing this Session Menu (i.e., so users can log out, restart & shut down without having to use the mouse)? Further, will the shortcut allow navigation through the menu by just typing the first letter of the listed word (e.g., R for restart and S for shut down)? \n\nA: In Unity, the Session Menu, and other indicators, are standard menu items.  You can reach the menu bar with F10 or other Alt-… combination; for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+F ← ↑ ↑ Enter\nwill generally get you to the Shut Down… entry by first opening the File menu and then jogging across via left-to-right then top-to-bottom wrap-around.\n\nA: Actually, if you want to restart/shutdown/etc you can do it (from 11.10) from the dash. Just press the BSB or the SUPER key (aka Windows key) and type \"restart\" (or whatever you want) and it will show up there. \nIn 12.04 you can tweak the desktop icons to achieve the same:\nHow to get the shutdown & restart icon back in dash\n\nA: Just worked out that the HUD does what you want. So press Alt and type \"sus\" (or \"shut\" ...) and you will get \"Device > Suspend\" (or \"Device > Shutdown ...\") as the first option. Press Enter and off you go :)\nThis bug report (comment #2) pointed out this way.\n\nA: I am using 12.04 development branch and Unity is up to version 5.2. I was running a test program for Unity 5.2 last night. Unity in 12.04 will give you what you want by pressing F10 followed by the left arrow key.\nPressing F10 brings up the application menu (File, Edit, etc.). We can use the right arrow key to move along the top panel until we get to the app indicators and eventually to the power cog icon or session menu, as you call it.\nA quicker way to do this is to press F10 and then the left arrow key instead of the right arrow key and we jump straight to the session menu (power cog) with its menu dropping down as all the menus do when using this feature.\nYour question is: \"Will ...\" this is what we have right now in 12.04 development branch and no, when we are in the session menu we cannot press R for re-start or S for shutdown. But you can press Ctrl-Alt-L for Lock Screen, which I am sure is in 11.10.\n", "Q: See configured rules even when inactive I'm wondering if it's possible to get UFW to list the configured firewall rules even when it's not enabled. I only have ssh access to the server at this time, and I don't want to enable UFW if there's not a rule configured allowing ssh. However, since UFW is currently not enabled, I just get an \"inactive\" message when I run \"ufw status\".\nIs there a special flag I can use or even some config file I can look at to see what rules are configured even when the firewall is disabled?\n\nA: From the command line, there doesn't seem to be a way.  However, if you're SSH'ing from an Ubuntu box (to an Ubuntu box), you might want to try this, slightly convoluted method :\nBasically, install gufw on the remote box, then connect with X forwarding and run the GUI.\nOn the remote device, after connecting with -X as an option :\nsudo apt-get install gufw\nsudo gufw\n\nThat will show you the ruleset without having to activate it.\nBe warned that if the remote device is a true \"headless\" server, then installing GUFW might pull down an unpleasant number of dependencies.  But unless someone here know a trick to make UFW show you the output you need without activating it first, then this might be your only option.\nI did try sudo ufw show raw, but that shows the iptables output, which I can't make head nor tail of.\n\nA: There is currently not a way to show the rules you have entered before enabling the firewall via the CLI command. You can inspect the rules files directly however. /lib/ufw/user*.rules contain the rules controlled via the 'ufw' CLI command. Eg:\n $ sudo grep '^### tuple' /lib/ufw/user*.rules\n\nThis will show output like the following (for the rule added with 'sudo ufw allow OpenSSH):\n /lib/ufw/user.rules:### tuple ### allow tcp 22 0.0.0.0/0 any 0.0.0.0/0 OpenSSH - in\n\nThe 'tuple' is the shorthand used internally by ufw to keep track of rules, and can be interpreted as one of these:\n ### tuple ### <action> <proto> <dst port> <dst> <src port> <src> <direction>\n ### tuple ### <action> <proto> <dst port> <dst> <src port> <src> <dst app name> <src app name> <direction>\n\nIt might be useful to be able to add another status command to support this. Please consider filing a bug.\n\nA: General rules are in /etc/ufw. User defined rules are in /lib/ufw/user*.\n\nA: There is now a ufw show added command that will list the configured rules for you, even when the firewall is inactive. It was added as a fix for this bug report and added in v0.33\nSo now you can do:\n# ufw status\nStatus: inactive\n# ufw allow ssh\nRules updated\nRules updated (v6)\n# ufw show added\nAdded user rules (see 'ufw status' for running firewall):\nufw allow 22\n# ufw enable\nFirewall is active and enabled on system startup\n# ufw status\nStatus: active\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n22                         ALLOW       Anywhere\n22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)\n\nThe format of the output from ufw show added makes it much easier to write the delete command for each rule too.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04, user defined rules are stored in /etc/ufw/user.rules. Therefore, you can see the rules with:\nsudo cat /etc/ufw/user.rules\n\n", "Q: Does ssh key need to be named id_rsa? I have come across this problem a couple of times when creating build servers with keyed authentication. \nI was wondering if anyone else has experience this. I have a couple of keys for my current user that may connect to different machines. Let say machine1 and machine2. I have pasted my public key into their respective authorized_keys file. The first one I have named the first key id_rsa and the second key bender. \nWhen I try to connect to bender I get the following output with my verbose ssh connection \ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/bozo/.ssh/.ssh/identity\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/bozo/.ssh/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/bozo/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: No more authentication methods to try.\nPermission denied (publickey).\n\nIt only offers the id_rsa key, as you can see above. Is this correct? If so why? How do I get it to offer more keys? I know it is a problem I see intermittently, because I at home I have multiple keys without much trouble. \nI would also appreciate a overview on how the pub and private keys interact with the client and server. I thought I had a pretty decent idea, but apparently I am missing something. \nPlease and thank you. \n\nA: My favourite method allows the private key to be selected automatically\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/%l_%r@%h_id_rsa\n\nSSH will replace %l with the local machine name, %r with the remote username, and %h with the remote host, thus if I wanted to connect from my machine called foo to bar as user, I run:\nssh bar\n\nAnd ssh would automatically use:\n~/.ssh/foo_user@bar_id_rsa\n\nAs the local host is also stored, this allows for home directories shared over NFS (different key per machine!) or even identifying which machine the key was meant to be on...\n\nA: By default, SSH searches for id_rsa, id_cdsa, id_ecdsa_sk, id_ed25519, id_ed25519_sk, and id_dsa files. The keys do not have to be named like this, you can name it mykey just as well, or even place it in a different directory. However, if you do either of those, then you need to explicitly reference the key in the ssh command like so:\nssh user@server -i /path/to/mykey\n\nIf a command does not accept -i, e.g. sshfs, use the IdentityFile option:\nsshfs -o IdentityFile=/path/to/mykey user@host:/path/on/remote /mountpoint\n\nHow It Works\nWhen generating a key, you'll get two files: id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key). As their names suggest, the private key should be kept secret and the public key can be published to the public.\nPublic-key authentication works with a public and a private key. Both the client and the server have their own keys. When installing openssh-server the server public and private keys are generated automatically. For the client, you'll have to do that on your own.\nWhen you (client) connect with a server, public keys are exchanged. You'll receive the servers one, and the server yours. The first time you receive the server public key, you'll be asked to accept it. If this public key changes over a time, you'll be warned because a possible MITM (Man in the middle) attack is going on, intercepting the traffic between the client and the server.\nThe server checks whether you are allowed to connect (defined in /etc/ssh/sshd_config) and if your public key is listed in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. Possible reasons why the public key is denied:\n\n*\n\n*/etc/ssh/sshd_config:\n\n*AllowUsers or AllowGroups is specified, but your server user is not listed in the groups or users list (default not defined, placing no restriction on the users or groups from logging in).\n\n*DenyUsers or DenyGroups is specified and you're in the users or groups list.\n\n*You're trying to login as root, but PermitRootLogin is set to No (default yes).\n\n*PubkeyAuthentication is set to No (default yes).\n\n*AuthorizedKeysFile is set to a different location, and the public keys are not added to that file (default .ssh/authorized_keys, relative to home dir)\n\n*~/.ssh/authorized_keys: your public key is not added in this file (note that this file is read as root user)\n\nUsing multiple keys\nIt's not uncommon to use multiple keys. Instead of running ssh user@host -i /path/to/identity_file, you can use a configuration file, ~/.ssh/config.\nCommon settings are the IdentityFile (the keys) and port. The next configuration will check \"id_dsa\" and \"bender\" only when connecting with ssh youruser@yourhost:\nHost yourhost\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bender\n\nIf you omit Host yourhost, the settings will apply to all SSH connections. Other options can also be specified for this host match, like User youruser, Port 2222, etc. This would allow you to connect with the shorthand ssh yourhost instead of ssh -p2222 youruser@yourhost -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa -i ~/.ssh/bender.\n\nA: In consideration of StevenRoose's comment that it takes longer to specify many keys, and I happen to be playing around with a lot of keys, I would like to suggest my personal solution.\nI create a symlink to the key that I want to use at the time, and since that only changes infrequently depending on which project I'm working on, I am happy with it.\nHere I have linked to my keys for machines running under virtualbox:\n$ cd .ssh/\n$ ln -s adam_vbox-id_rsa.pub id_rsa.pub\n$ ln -s adam_vbox-id_rsa id_rsa\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 12\n-rw------- 1 adam adam 1675 2013-10-04 02:04 adam_vbox-id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 adam adam  396 2013-10-04 02:04 adam_vbox-id_rsa.pub\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 adam adam   16 2013-10-04 02:17 id_rsa -> adam_vbox-id_rsa\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 adam adam   20 2013-10-04 02:17 id_rsa.pub -> adam_vbox-id_rsa.pub\n-rw-r--r-- 1 adam adam 3094 2013-10-04 02:09 known_hosts\n\nOne could also add a really quick script to change over to another set without having to manually type the ln command again.\nAgain, this isn't a solution for two keys only, but for a greater number, it might be workable.\n", "Q: How to migrate network manager settings I'm moving from an old ubuntu box to a new one.\nIs there a way to export the network manager settings from the old machine and import them in the new one?\n\nA: Network manager configuration file are stored in /etc/NetworkManager.Browse the folder and you can see your defined connections.\nMoving appropriate files from this folder to the same folder in new ubuntu will solve your problem.\nUse this command to browse the folder: \ngksudo nautilus /etc/NetworkManager\n\n\nA: As far as I understand /etc/NetworkManager does not contain passwords, so that matter should be dealt with separately. As well as other settings and certificates (e.g. openvpn connection settings) which do not work through NetworkManager.\n", "Q: All files erased after installing Ubuntu Yeah, I know I should have backed up my files before proceeding, I completely forgot. Well, the thing is that I had a dual-boot system with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.10. Yesterday, I installed Ubuntu 11.04 alpha 3 (through live USB). I chose that 11.04 would install over 10.10 on the installation wizard, where I have no important files.

Mind that the likelihood for successful recovery decreases with every write access to your harddisk. Therefore best advice is to run these tools after booting from a live disk.\nBy installing \ntestdisk \nyou may be able to recover whole partitions. Included in the TestDisk suite you will also find the tool PhotoRec that helps to recover individual files even in the case a partition can not be restored or the drive itself has a hardware defect.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reading the TestDisk Wiki or PhotoRec Wiki is highly recommended\n\n\nA: Sounds like the installer decided to butcher your entire drive. (i.e. it was set up to use the entire drive).\nIf that is what the installer did, then your windows data is, at this point, gone.

What I have noticed is that not all applications behave well with it. E.g. sound is choppy using Ubuntu's default application for music Rhythmbox, but it is instead good using the Linux preview of Spotify. \nMy guess is that quality depends on the bitrate by which audio is pushed to the Airport Express, as if the device was capable of supporting effectively audio that is streamed to it only according to a specific set of parameters.\nThis hypothesis is consistent also with this alternative solution to the problem: using VLC to encode on the fly and stream all audio to the Airport Express: http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=97111 . I could not make this work, though.\nIn an ideal world, Pulse support for Airplay would take care of the re-encoding.

For Ubuntu 10.04, as you found in the previous answer, the pid file syntax is incorrect.\nAny time you get that 'unknown job\" error back, its a good idea to check the logs (pre 11.04, /var/log/daemon.log, 11.04 and greater everything goes in /var/log/syslog)\nYou may see an error like this:\ninit: /etc/init/test.conf:2: Unknown stanza\n\n\nA: You can also run init-checkconf to check syntax \ninit-checkconf /etc/init/job.conf\nFile /etc/init/job.conf: syntax ok\n\n\nA: Anyway I'am here because i had the same problem, but my syntax was 100% correct.\nAfter some debugging I discovered another issue that can cause this \"Unknown job\" error:\nupstarts uses inotify to monitor .conf file changes and auto install jobs, this is very cool (for this you don't need something like update.rc with upstart!) but can be not perfect if you (like me in that case) use some FTP/SCP GUI program to upload and edit configurations on remote servers, the job can be silently uninstalled by upstart when you edit file in that manner.\nto fix simply do that (that saved me)\ntouch /etc/init/*\n\nit will generate inotify events to refresh all upstart confs.\n\nA: It usually means you have an error in the .conf file - for instance I'm not sure the pid stanza is supported in 10.04, stop can't be used in the script etc. \nI'd try starting the file from scratch (with only start, stop etc), and then slowly building it up by adding more and more lines and testing it via start pure-ftpd.\nFor example:\n# cat pure-ftpd.conf \nstart on filesystem\nstop on runlevel S\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\n\n# start pure-ftpd\npure-ftpd start/running\n\n# cat pure-ftpd.conf \nstart on filesystem\nstop on runlevel S\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\npid file /var/run/pure-ftpd.pid\n\n# start pure-ftpd\nstart: Unknown job: pure-ftpd\n\n\nA: First, you can check that your job is actually known to upstart:\nsudo initctl list | grep your_job_name\n\n...where your_job_name is the name of your upstart script minus the .conf extension.\nIf it's not found, you can try reloading the configuration and then re-checking:\nsudo initctl reload-configuration\n\n# re-check\nsudo initctl list | grep your_job_name\n\nThen try again to start your job:\nsudo start your_job_name\n\nIf you weren't getting any logging in /var/log/daemon.log or /var/log/syslog before, you might have some now.\n\nA: I had the same problem in my Ubuntu 14.04 Docker containers. As it turns out, the Ubuntu 14.04 image (if not others) for Docker does not support Upstart in the same way that a full virtual machine would. \nTo answer this question, why the service does not start, it is because initctl is not an actual Upstart program: it is mapped to /bin/true.\nTo verify run the following on a Ubuntu 14.04 Docker container vs. Vagrant, and vs. a DigitalOcean droplet\n$ ls -al /sbin/initctl\n\nYou'll see initctl is not the same in Docker vs. the others.\nA link that may further your understanding.. https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/1024\n", "Q: 2 hard drives / HD1: UBuntu HD2: Win7. best practice isolated os's for dual boot is there any reason this wouldn't work or is a bad idea?  in bios make the HD1 the default boot drive and installing ubuntu, and HD2 installing windows 7.

This should then spit you back out to wherever you stored the shell script.\n", "Q: Touchpad frozen after resume on a Gateway MX6650/MA2A After the computer is resumed from sleep, the trackpad no longer works.

I've tried the brightness keys for my laptop in both Maverick and Natty and they don't work in either distribution. The key seems to be taken as a shortcut somewhere because it won't allow me to reassign it else where. How can I actually get these brightness keys to work?\nPending that, where/to whom should I report this hardware issue to?\n\nA: They do work with Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick. Do not use Fn with F2, instead just press the F2 key by itself to reduce contrast. Press F3 by itself to increase contrast. Some idiot must have thought that the Functions keys are hardly being used, and set the secondary function of the keys to be ALWAYS ON - ie. they are reversed.\nSo if you want to do an Alt F2 to run a program, you need to do an ALt Fn F2 to do it. If you want to do a F7 you need to do a Fn F7.\nIf you want your keyboard to act like a normal keyboard you need to go into Bios and change this silly setting. Restart the machine, and press the ESC key followed by the F10 key to get into Bios. Look for Action Key Mode and change the setting to disabled. Save changes and exit f10.\nIf you want to use the lock symbol key that is on the upper row on the keyboard. On the menu bar, Go to System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts. Scroll down the list and find Lock Screen, it will be set to CTRL+ALT+L, click on the shortcut, it will get cleared, press the lock symbol key, and the shortcut will be changed to Mod4+L, click the close button. Now you can lock your computer just by pressing one key.\nYou can re-assign the other keys, to start your favourite applications. The key with a wired globe has been set to open your home folder by default. I'm thinking of changing the calculator key to start up LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet instead of the calculator.\nMerlin2525\n", "Q: How to schedule time-of-day upgrades I'm responsible for about 30 Ubuntu computers at a private K-8 school.  We have only a 3Mbps internet connection serving the entire campus, and I would like to ensure that updates are done in the middle of the night - so that daytime tasks are not slowed down.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04, and have set all computers to download and install security updates via the update manager.  I have also installed cron-apt, and modified the config file to stagger the start times of the upgrades from about 10pm to 4am local time.\nHOWEVER - this morning I arrived at the school at 7:30am and all the computers were busy downloading a large security based update.  Needless to say, all internet activity was slowed to a crawl (for the next 2 hours), and the computer users were very very upset.  This was the event I'm trying so hard to prevent.\nIt seems that my scheme to ensure middle of the night downloads failed, and I'm not sure why.\nI've also tried some schemes using unattended-upgrades & crontab, but there always seemed to be something scheduling upgrades to occur in addition to the ones I try to force at middle of the night.\nIs there a sure fire way to absolutely positively guarantee that updates will occur only at one specific time?  It would be nice if the update manager just had a drop down menu to specify a designated time.\nThanks in advance for any help you can give me.\n\nA: Not an answer to your exact issue but a workaround that presents you with significant benefits: why don't you just use a proxy?\nThere are numerous options but I'd start with squid-deb-proxy. You'll need one machine to serve as the host but this could easily be one of the machines you're dealing with. Similarly it could be a separate server. Doesn't need to be powerful.\nThe idea is updated packages need only be downloaded once. They get cached and all the other machines download from the local cache.\nYou still need to stagger the update process. One machine needs to download the updates to fill the cache. You could use one machine to download the updates at night (using a simple @daily cron job -- happens at midnight). The other machines could be turned off over night (saving a lot of money) and then could just grab their updates when they like. They'd only use internal bandwidth so would fly.\nSome tips on setting it up can be read here.\n\nA: Looks like you are using two independent update mechanisms: cron-apt and the Update Manager. Try disabling automatic updates in the Update Manager. If cron-apt is configured correctly, you will get a notification email each time a new update is installed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu confuses my partitions I have 3 relevant partitions split between 2 disks,\nsda2: Windows 1 partition\nsda3: Ubuntu partition\nsdb1: Data partition\n\nI was using pysdm to add a label to my partitions and somehow I seem to have screwed up my installation.

I find the icons that show up when I plug a flash drive useful, as much as SD cards and devices. However, the icon to my Windows partition is useless. How can I hide it?\n\nA: To hide a partition, mount the partitions in your '/mnt' folder.  I use the fstab file to accomplish this automatically on boot up.\n\nA: Eject or unmount those which are not in use.

This is what the final thing will look like.\nThe host and client are both going to be my laptop. I Googled and came across apt-mirror and some other packages. I do not want to archive the entire 15 GB Ubuntu repositories on my machine. \nIt is not possible to use a CD, ISO, loop mounted disk. I have tried using netboot image on local machine which failed because if you are attempting to create a virtual machine on a hardware which does not support VT virt-manager installer necessarily needs a URL of this sort \nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/\nAny other option to create guest OS is simply grayed out.\nMy Ethernet connections do not work when I boot with Xen-4.0 and a pv-ops Dom0 kernel from Jeremy's tree. Which is where I have to do this work. So I have to create a URL structure which is similar to Ubuntu mirrors. So how can I do this in bare minimum so that at least the console boots and once the console comes I can do some work.\n\nA: Using apt-mirror  you can get it down to only 7.5 GiB. \nYou can comment out the source, updates, security, universe and multiverse repositories in its config file, /etc/apt/mirror.list This leaves you only with the contents of main. As main contains everything that is shipped on the different CD images, it should be enough to get you installed. It might not be the smallest solution, but it's probably the simplest.\n\nA: This answer provides to way of doing what you are asking. https://askubuntu.com/a/154580/1110324\n\nlocal repository method.\nThere is a lot more easier method than using AptOnCD. Though I have included AptOnCD method as the question talked about that.\nCopy all .deb files into the target computer\nYou need to copy all .deb files you download from /var/cache/apt/archives folder to a suitable folder in your target Internetless computer. I recommend you to copy all the files in a folder named debs which itself resides in a folder named LocalRepo. Meaning, .deb files are in LocalRepo/debs folder. You can put the LocalRepo folder wherever you wish. Let say, for example, I have put it in my home directory i.e. /home/anwar.\nSo, the folder structure is like below:\n-/\n -/home\n   -/anwar\n    -/LocalRepo\n     -/debs\n\nwhere debs folder contains all the deb files you downloaded.\nGenerate packages index file\nOpen a terminal and go to the folder just above the Debs folder. In this example, it is /home/anwar/LocalRepo.\nRun this command: while you are in LocalRepo folder.\napt-ftparchive packages . > Packages\nIt will create a Packages file in the LocalRepo directory.\nAdd your local repository in the repository source list\nOpen /etc/apt/sources.list file with root privilege\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.\nAt the top of sources.list file, put a line like this.\n\n`deb file:/home/anwar/LocalRepo /`\n\nreplace /home/anwar/LocalRepo with actual directory name where you put the LocalRepo folder.\n\nSave the file, and exit gedit.\nUpdate package indexes to be able to install from Local repo\nRun sudo apt-get update in a terminal, It will create a repository source list about available repositories. So, your newly created Local Repository will be recognized.\nInstall packages from local repository.\nThen run `sudo apt-get install package-name`\n(replacing package-name with actual package) to install your desired repository.\n\nNote: You will always be warned about being your repository is not \"Authenticated\" one. In this case you can ignore such warning, since you created repository from packages of \"Authenticated\" sources, meaning Official Ubuntu Package archive.\nYou can override this warning by putting --allow-unauthenticated switch in the command. such as\nsudo apt-get install --allow-unauthenticated package-name\nCreating a trusted repository instead:\nIf you want to create a trusted local repository, You should read this. It is very simple and very good one about the topic\n\nEdit: I found that when sharing the repro using the steps above, I needed to pass -o Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories=true the the apt commands to get it to work.\n", "Q: Error during Edubuntu installation: process:226 We recently introduced Edbuntu to a team of school teachers.

I tried to logout and saw this message:\n\nSince other torrent clients have th same issue maybe it's something about file size.I'm using ubuntu 10.04 on ext4 partitions.Killing nautilus and sending SIGCHLD signal to it didn't work.\n\nA: I don't thing zombie process is much of a headache. A zombie process does not take up any resources. It is just that it has it's entry in the process table.\nA Zombie process is not an orphan process, it does have a parent.\nkill, skill pkill will not work since the process is already killed, just that it's entry has not been removed. \nZombie process can be killed by sending SIGCHLD signal to parent. \nI think the signal number of SIGCHLD is 17 or 18\nIf this also fails, then you might want to kill the parent itself.\nFrom Wikipedia on SIGCHLD signal:\n\nWhen a child process terminates before\n  the parent has called wait, the kernel\n  retains some information about the\n  process to enable its parent to call\n  wait later. Because the child is\n  still consuming system resources but\n  not executing it is known as a zombie\n  process.\n\n\nEDIT 1: The system resources consumed is mostly the process table entry. If anyone knows if it consumes more than that - memory or CPU cycle, then please add an explanation. AFAIK it hardly takes up any significant system resources. \n\nEDIT 2: Quoting from Wikipedia\n\nOn Unix and Unix-like computer\n  operating systems, a zombie process or\n  defunct process is a process that has\n  completed execution but still has an\n  entry in the process table. This entry\n  is still needed to allow the process\n  that started the (now zombie) process\n  to read its exit status.\n\nSo the entry is kept so that the parent process can know the exit status because the moment the child exits, the parent is probably not in a state or not ready to read it's exit status.\n\nEDIT 3\nTill date I never experienced a zombie process taking 100% of the CPU. Seeing this for the first time.\nTry doing a killall utorrent.exe\nI can see that there are two instances of utorrent.exe and one of them is zombie. Probably the second one (child). killall should kill the parent since the child(zombie) cannot be killed.\n\nEDIT 4\nLooks like the killall did not work since it was giving TERM signal instead of KILL.\nTry out killall --signal=KILL utorrent.exe\nIf this does not work then try killing the process selectivly.\nGet the list of utorrent.exe process PID\n\nps -e | grep -i utorrent\n\nYou should get two process like\nxxxx ?        aa:bb:cc utorrent.exe defunct\nyyyy ?        aa:bb:cc utorrent.exe\n\nSo the second one is the parent.\nKill it using\n\nkill -9 yyyy\n\nEDIT 5\nPlease try finding the process's Parent Id by this bash command\n\ncat /proc/{defunctpid}/status | grep -i ppid\n\nin your case is\n\ncat /proc/7298/status | grep -i ppid\n\nIf the output comes like\n\nPPid: 1\n\nThen sadly I think you are out of luck. Process Id 1 belongs to init without which your system cannot run\n\nA: Much easier way than killall, -9, etc:\n1)Use qBitorrent instead instead of the console uTorrent (I'm waiting for a GUI version as well and qBitorrent is essentially it).\n2)If you are using 11.04 or above, hit alt+f2 (opens a special commands window), type xkill and your mouse is now an x. Click on the program you want to close (UI = process ID) and it will kill it for you.\nAdvanced tip: bind a keyboard shortcut for \"xkill\" like I have on my G15 macro keyboard.\n\nA: Using kill on the process itself is indeed ineffective, as the process is already dead; kill brings a live process to zombie state.\nThe parent process is responsible for picking up the exit code of the process; the process remains a zombie until this is done. The init process will pick up the exit code of any process and throw it away, so it is the \"last-resort\" parent that will clean up any zombie that is a direct descendant.\nKilling the parent of the zombie process is usually effective because the zombie process then reverts to init as its parent as soon as the parent process is gone (i.e. killing the parent has turned that process into a zombie, and the grandparent has read the parent's exit code, so the parent is truly gone). A zombie can be parent to a zombie, so merely killing the parent is not sufficient, it also needs to be collected by another process itself.\nNote that processes are never responsible for cleaning up their grandchildren -- they always revert to process 1 as parent (which is why daemon authors sometimes use a double fork() and terminate the process in the middle to fully disassociate the child process from the invoking shell)\nThe reason why killing wine probably isn't effective is because it wasn't really the parent of the zombie process; rather, the \"utorrent.exe\" that is a direct descendant of init is. This process however is still running normally, just neglecting its duties.\n\nA: In my case when wine hangs and i can not kill the Zombie child with a shotgun i would do:\nwineserver -k then i would kill the \"Son of the Process\" killall -9 Oblivion.exe (For example)\nFor what i understand wineserver sends a signal to all its Zombie Childs that they are all going to die (Because of the shotgun you know) but sometimes a child thinks by itself and wants to take the world by storm. So i do the additional killall -9 or the kill -9 with the id of the process.\n\nA: My guess is that you're using an SSD.\nWhen adding large torrents to a torrent client, the \"placeholder\" files of the torrent you are downloading are actually created on disk, but are empty until gradually filled during the download process.  \nWith a normal hard disk, the disk is the bottleneck, and you won't notice a performance issue with the rest of your desktop. \nWhen using an SSD however, the CPU is the bottleneck, and the application appears to have crashed (goes gray). If you leave it for a while, it will recover and all will be well. This has been my experience since switching to an SSD. \nWith regard to killing processes, others have provided better advice than I can - using the KILL signal usually works, but I have had the odd one that required a restart over the years. \n", "Q: Unity install removed window borders, and display drivers I installed unity, used for a while.

I'd like to reduce the contrast of the GTK widgets, that is, make the borders less articulate. E.g. in the screenshot below, the separator above and below the toolbar is very strong. I'd like smoother borders.\nHow is this possible?\n\n\nA: This is not possible in the way you imagine without getting a new or different theme (system > preferences > appearance). Although you can kindof reduce or increase the contrast of a window with compiz, this will likely not give you the output you desire, as it will kindof reduce the contrast of the entire window (text and icons included).\nIf you want to do it with compiz:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ccsm\n\n*Open ccsm (System > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager)\n\n*Enable the \"Color filter\" module\n\n*Change the key bindings to suit your needs, and see if any of the filters do what you want :)\n\n\nA: Actually, I don't know of any way to do that.

I have some passwords that are long, complicated and hard to remember. \nI would like to use a password-manager application to save all of my passwords instead of saving them using a text editor.  \nWhat is the best password manager?\n\nA: I really like LastPass It's not open source, but is very well supported across platforms, browsers and devices. They recently acquired XMarks (great cross platform/cross browser bookmark sync tool). LastPass is incredibly secure, offers 2nd pass authentication and is very reliable.\n\nA: KeePassX is another option:\n\nKeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on\n  secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross\n  platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public\n  License.\nKeePassX saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords,\n  urls, attachments and comments in one single database. For a better\n  management user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each\n  single entry. Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are\n  customizable as well. The integrated search function allows to search\n  in a single group or the complete database. KeePassX offers a little\n  utility for secure password generation. The password generator is very\n  customizable, fast and easy to use. Especially someone who generates\n  passwords frequently will appreciate this feature.\n\n\nThe program is available in the Software Center but I can't figure out how to make a nice install button which works :)\nKeepassX is also available for Windows and MacOS. \n\nA: You can use Figaro's Password Manager 2\n\n\nFigaro's Password Manager 2 (FPM2) is a program that allows you to\n  securely store the passwords. Passwords are encrypted with the AES-256\n  algorithm.\nIf the password is for a web site, FPM2 can keep track of the URLs of\n  your login screens and can automatically launch your browser. In this\n  capacity, FPM2 acts as a kind of bookmark manager. You can teach FPM2\n  to launch other applications, and optionally pass hostnames, usernames\n  or passwords to the command line.\nFPM2 also has a password generator that can choose passwords for you.\n  It allows you to determine how long the password should be, and what\n  types of characters (lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols)\n  should be used. You can even have it avoid ambiguous characters such\n  as a capital O or the number zero.\n\nSource: http://linuxpoison.blogspot.com/2012/02/ui-based-password-manager-figaros.html\n\nA: I use password cards. There is an open source desktop version being developed called Randy. Until then you can use passwordcard.org\n\nA: KeePass2 \nWhile KeePassX is very easy to install and manage, I personally prefer KeePass2. While a bit harder to customize and having a tendency to act up on Unity, it offers far better browser integration IMHO.\nWith KeePass, you'll never ever have to enter a password again on any website. You will not even have to break your fingers with some strange keyboard shortcut. KeePass recognizes the website you're on and submits your login data fully automatical, leaving you only with one mouse click on 'login' to do.\nIt's very handy and convienient.\nA tutorial about how-to install and configure it to work with Chrome/Chromium can be found here.\n\nA: KeePassX \n\nKeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.\n\n\n\nA: I suggest you the free, cross-platform KeePassXC, a fork of KeePassX. I'm using its DB on my Android phone too (KeePassDroid, combined with Dropbox).\n\nmore screenshots\n\nKeePassXC is a modern, secure, and open-source password manager\nthat stores and manages your most sensitive information.\nYou can run KeePassXC on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.\nKeePassXC is for people with extremely high demands of secure personal\ndata management. It saves many different types of information, such as\nusernames, passwords, URLs, attachments, and notes in an offline,\nencrypted file that can be stored in any location, including private\nand public cloud solutions.\nFor easy identification and management, user-defined titles and icons\ncan be specified for entries. In addition, entries are sorted in\ncustomizable groups. An integrated search function allows you to use\nadvanced patterns to easily find any entry in your database. A\ncustomizable, fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility allows\nyou to create passwords with any combination of characters or easy to\nremember passphrases.\nYou can install it from the Ubuntu software center:\n\nKeePassXC \nsnap package on all supported OSes or Linux distros:\nsnap install keepassxc\n\napt on Ubuntu/Debian/deb based:\napt -y install keepassxc\n\nyum/dnf on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/other EL/other RPM based:\nyum -y install keepassxc\n\nor\ndnf -y install keepassxc\n\nchoco on Windows:\nchoco -y install keepassxc\n\nbrew on Mac:\nbrew -y install keepassxc\n\n\n\nKeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way.

The databases are encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.\n\n\nYou can find the features here, and more screenshots here.\n\nA: Seahorse is an application that is installed in Ubuntu by default and manages passwords for various applications.\n\n\nA: I like using Password Dragon, a password-manager written by the author of \"The Geek Stuff\" blog. It is cross-platform, Java-based, and works with Windows, Linux, and OS X. \n\n\nA: October-1-2015: (for Ubuntu all versions)\nEnpass 5.0 RC was released recently (64bit only for Linux)\nwith most important feature: browser extensions for both Firefox and Chrome on Linux.\nInstallation:\n1.Go to official website enpass.io.\n  Select Enpass for Linux.You need to enter your email,then link will be sent  to your email.\n2.After downloading, run the following commands:\ncd  ~/Downloads\nchmod +x EnpassInstaller\nsudo apt-get install libxss1\n./EnpassInstaller\n\nMethod 2:\nTo install Enpass, add new repository to /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo su\necho \"deb http://repo.sinew.in/ stable main\" > \\\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/enpass.list\nwget -O - http://repo.sinew.in/keys/enpass-linux.key | apt-key add -\napt-get update\napt-get install enpass\n\n\nA: Just for full measure, it should be noted that browsers on Ubuntu support saving passwords and syncing them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox saves passwords, and you can share them with other Firefox installations on other devices (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Firefox OS) using Firefox Accounts/Firefox Sync. Everything is encrypted client-side, which means Mozilla can't know your passwords, but it also means that if you forget your Firefox Accounts password and lose access to all your devices, you could lose all your passwords. There used to be an option to use your own server to store your uploaded data, but I haven't tried it and I don't know if it's supported any more. Firefox Accounts does not support two-factor authentication.\n\n*Chrome also allows you to sync passwords across devices. Google stores your passwords in the cloud, but not in a zero-knowledge way (AFAIK). If you forget your Google password, then you need to use the usual methods to recover your Google account. Google supports two-factor authentication with your mobile phone number.\n\n*Chromium works the same way as Chrome.\n\n*Opera lets you sync passwords as well, presumably it stores them in Opera servers like Chrome does, (no two-factor authentication and not zero-knowledge, AFAICT).\n\n*GNOME Web (or Epiphany) stores saved passwords in the Passwords and Encryption Keys application (Seahorse), I don't know if there's a built-in way to sync this data.\n\n\nTLDR:\nFirefox:    sync,   zero-knowledge,     no 2FA\nChrome/ium: sync,   not zero-knowledge, 2FA with phone number\nOpera:      sync,   not zero-knowledge, no 2FA\nEpiphany:   no sync\n\nAll these browsers have ways of looking at your list of saved passwords, but they don't match all the features of most password managers, as you can only store passwords meant for websites, and not passwords in general. Some of the browsers can import saved passwords from other browsers, and many password managers can import saved passwords from other browsers.\n\nA: Visionary Password Manager\nQuoting the project page\nConventional password managers have a few flaws. They work by generating passwords, encrypting them with a master password, and then storing or syncing the encrypted passwords somewhere.\nThere are a few problems with this approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*The encrypted data can be lost, thereby locking the user out of all of their accounts.\n\n*The encrypted data can be stolen. If the user was using a weak master password, all of their accounts can be compromised.\n\n*The data can only be synced to a limited number of devices.\n\n\nVisionary Password Manager improves on these shortcomings considerably:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your passwords are generated on-the-fly based on a pure algorithm. This means that the only thing that would make you lose your data is you forgetting your master password.\n\n*Nothing is stored so there's nothing to steal.\n\n*There are thousands of iterations of Scrypt, making brute-forcing infeasible.\n\n*No need to sync data, as there's nothing to sync! You can use this script or our API (coming soon) from anywhere in the world, and from any device, to generate your passwords.\n\n\nA: KeepassXC\nKeepass has already been recommended here, but not XC. KeepassXC is written more with Linux in mind. It is itself a successor/community version of KeepassX, itself with a similar goal. All 3 are cross-platform today, but Keepass is probably best for Windows users; Ubuntu users may require mono to run it. For Ubuntu, KeepassXC would be my recommendation.\n", "Q: Does any version of Ubuntu ARM support ARM926EJ-S rev 5 (v5l) The Android System Info application on my tablet says that my processor is ARM926EJ-S rev 5 (v5l). Which version of Ubuntu ARM will work on it?\nWill I have any issues finding packages for the ARM architecture?\n\nA: That processor is an ARMv5TEJ architecture processor. \nFrom http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/ :\n\nUbuntu targets the ARM EABI, with an expetation of minimum compliance with the ARMv7+VFP ISA. Limited support for earlier instruction sets (ARMv5t, ARMv6) was available in early releases of the ARM port (jaunty, karmic). Ubuntu typically targets the Thumb2 instruction set.\n\nSo only jaunty or karmic would work for you.\nInstead I suggest you use Debian ARM, which still has support for older ARM processors.\n", "Q: How to configure Evolution to use DavMail's LDAP contacts?

But now the three-key combinations (i.e. the ones I use for \"move to...\") stopped working. When I go to keyboard preferences, I still see them and I can even change them to a different combination and then again to the desired one - but they won't execute the window movement afterwards :/ Any suggestions how to fix this?\n\nA: I think Compiz is preventing these shortcuts to work. Can you try this:  \nmetacity --replace\nThen try your shortcuts.  \nElse, if you want your visual effects by Compiz, you can do a trick: \nIf you are using Compiz, you will have to do a trick because Compiz \"workspaces\" are actually Viewports of a single Workspace.    \nWe will need wmctrl and Compiz.\nYou can install these from the Ubuntu Software Center or by clicking here (wmctrl) and here (Compiz)\nThe Shortcuts \n# Open Compiz (Alt + F2 and type ccsm and hit Enter)  \n# Go to Keybindings and make the shortcuts you want.  \n# Then go to Commands and add the commands for yours shortcuts (see below).   \nThe Commands (Trick Instructions) \nGo to a terminal and check the output of wmctrl -d. For example, mine is:  \n\n0  * DG: 4098x2304  VP: 1366,0  WA: 0,23 1366x745  N/A  \n\nThis means that actually I have one Workspace of 4098 x 2304 instead of what I \"think\" I have (nine \"workspaces\", 3 x 3).\nI was at what was supposed to be \"workspace\" 2, but actually I was at viewport (VP) 1366,0 (4098 / 3 = 1366) as showed by the output above.  \nSo this is how it works: we take the whole Workspace and divide for the numbers of \"workspaces\" we \"think\" we have. In my case: 4098 / 3 = 1366 and 2304 / 3 = 768.  \nif I want to go to my \"workspace\" 1, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 0,0 \nThen, if I want to go to my \"workspace\" 4, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 0,768 \nif I want to go to my \"workspace\" 8, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 1366,1536 \nif I want to go to my \"workspace\" 9, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 2732,1536 \nGot it?  ;-)\n", "Q: How can I make Tomboy start a certain note on login?

One question.  Is there a way to get the screensaver to show up  when the system is operating on battery power only?  Right now, the system just blanks the screen, but I'd really like to see an actual screensaver when I blank my screen.  Any way to do this?\n\nA: Open Settings → Power Management Preferences, select the On Battery Power tab, and adjust the “Put display to sleep when inactive for” option to suit your needs.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this counts as an answer, but If you open up the Screensaver application from the dash, there's a slider near the bottom that sets when the computer is regarded as idle. Make sure that number is not higher than the setting for when to put the computer to sleep.

If so, how can I modify my partitions without affecting my existing Mac OS X installation?\n\nA: I made it last week. First install refit on mac. Tried so many times with partitioning tool in disk utility but gave an error and asked more reduce. \nAnyway, due to defrag problems I gave up to continue with disk utility and I made a boot cd burning in disc utility with gparted (OS not gparted software which is in ubuntu repo) on it.

But do not forget to make a full back up. \nNow everthing works fine in leopard 10.6 and in ubuntu ...\n\nA: You don't need refit and any special hack...\nJust start bootcamp and insert ubuntu cd instead of the windows one...\nWhen you are in the ubuntu installer, choose manual partitioning and delete the bootcamp partition(created by your mac automatically) and use the free space for a new partition (ext4 mountpoint is '/')\nIf anything goes wrong you can delete the ubuntu partition from your mac. Note that mac uses efi so you don't have to worry about mbr stuff...

I frequently need to start several programs that I use every time I start my computer. How can I make it so that whenever I login the program is automatically launched?\n\nA: To make a program start with Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Unity, search\nfor the program Startup\nApplications.\n\n*If you're using Ubuntu Classic,\nit's under Start Menu >\nPreferences > Startup Applications.\n\nTo make Ubuntu remember your running applications on shutdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, and run\ngconf-editor.\n\n*Navigate to\n/apps/gnome-session/options.\n\n*Enable the option:\nauto_save_session.\n(NOTE: this may slow system boot, and has not been throughly tested.)\n\nA: Another, possibly simpler, option would be to go to menu System/Preferences/Startup applications, then choose the \"Options\" tab and tick \"Automatically remember running applications when logging out\"\n\nThis will start up any applications you have running when you log out.\n\nA: None of the answers (until now) gives a user-independent solution.  \nThe correct way (according to this thread) to add some autorunning program (named a Desktop Entry) for the whole Operating System is adding it as a .desktop file here:\n/etc/xdg/autostart\n\nExample of .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MyScript\nGenericName=A descriptive name\nComment=Some description about your script\nExec=/path/to/my/script.sh\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nNo need to chmod it to executable permission, it seems.\nThe Exec will run for any logging user, including root, ubuntu or xubuntu (for custom Live distribution desktops)\n\nA: User defined sessions for applications to start after login\nAn alternative way to automatically start applications after login is to define a user defined session. This has the advantage to use different sessions for different task, each with different applications loaded.\nFor this purpose we create a custom.desktop file as root in /usr/share/xsessions with the following content (for GNOME/GDM):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Marco's Crowded Session\nComment=Custom ~/.xsession script\nExec=/home/username/.xsession\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gdm\n\nUse any fancy name for your session and replace username by your name of course.\nThis will run the script .xsession in the HOME directory at login where we can put in any appplications we need to start after login.\nThe script needs to be named as defined in the .desktop file, that is ~/.xsession in the example given, needs to be made executable and may have a content similar to this:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nmy-important-app [options] &\nsecond-app [options] &\n[...]                       # add other applications\ngnome-session [options]\n\nOptions for gnome-session may be omitted to load the default session. Give e.g. --session=classic-gnome as option to run Classic GNOME Desktop in 11.04.\nNext time we login we will have the choice to start a \"Marco's Crowded Session\" with all applications from the script running in addition to applications from the gnome-session (or any other desktop manager you chose to start here).\nStarting other desktop managers\nTo start another installed desktop manager replace the last line from the ~/.xsession script with the following:\n\n*\n\n*gnome-session --session=ubuntu for standard desktop (with Unity in 11.04).\n\n*gnome-session --session=classic-gnome for classic GNOME desktop.\n\n*startkde for KDE desktop manager.\n\n*startxfce4 for XFCE, or when running Xubuntu.\n\n\nA: 12.04 (Unity)\nWe can add applications to the \"Startup Applications\" by opening the menu entry on the top panel right side:\n\n14.04 (Unity) and later\nWe can search the Dash for \"startup applications\"\n\nor we can run the startup preferences from a terminal with\ngnome-session-properties\n\n\nThis will open a window where we can see all installed applications that will run on startup. Tick or untick the applications there or choose \"Add\" to add a new application:\n\nIf we know the command to run the application just enter it here in the \"Command\" line. We may also add an optional \"Comment\" here.\nIf we do not know the command we can choose to \"Browse...\" our file system for installed applications. Many default applications are found e.g. in /usr/share/application:\n\nSelect an application to add to autostart.\nCommand line or programmatical approach\nSimilar to what the GUI solution above does we can manually add a .desktop file to ~/.config/autostart. The content of this file may be as follows:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=</path/to/binary or command to execute>\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName=<Name_to_be_displayed>\nComment=<optional comment>\n\nNote that in a vanilla installation the directory ~/.config/autostart may not yet exist. We need to create it before we can access it programmatically.\n\nA: If you are using the GNOME Desktop Environment, then this is rather simple to accomplish.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System>Preferences>Startup Applications, \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you can either add an application by clicking add,\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*And adding the application/script you want to run on startup,\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Or you can add an application by dragging the launcher you wish to add from the Application menu to the Startup Applications screen.\n\n\nA: In 11.04, you press the powerbutton (rightmost on the upper panel) and select System settings. You'll find Startup Applications under Personal preferences.

For this purpose we create a custom.desktop file as root in /usr/share/xsessions with the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Cairo Dock Session\nComment=Custom ~/.xsession script\nExec=/home/username/.xsession\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gdm\n\nReplace username by your name of course.\nThis will run a script in the HOME directory at login where we can put in any appplications we need to run after login.\nTo run Cairo Dock and GNOME classic desktop we create a file named ~/.xsession with the following content and make it executable:\n#! /bin/bash\n\ncairo-dock -o &\ngnome-session --session=classic-gnome\n\nNext time we login we will have the choice to run a Cairo Dock Session (option -c for no open GL) with GNOME classic desktop.\n\nA: There's a guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompizStandalone for making your own session file, where you can customize exactly what programs you want to start for what sessions. \n", "Q: Which music player can write ratings to tags, or: How to not lose my song ratings upon reinstall? One thing that has always annoyed massively is that all my ratings get lost when I reinstall my system. And that happens often.\n I know from MediaMonkey for Windows that it is possible to write the rating to tags. Interestingly, when loading the songs into Banshee, for instance, the ratings are recognized in fact!    \nBut apparently, Banshee does not write ratings to the ID3 tag itself.  Which player is capable of that?\n\nA: Banshee can do this, but you first need to go to Edit->Preferences and tick the checkbox labelled \"Write ratings and play counts to files\".\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Banshee\n\n*Songbird (no longer officially supported for Linux)\n\n\nA: Also - Quod Libet can (optionally) save ratings into many audio formats.\n", "Q: Why does my resolv.conf file get regenerated every time? My /etc/resolv.conf file gets regenerated every time, making me loose Google DNS servers when I reconnect my 3G modem.\nFor changing the DNS settings, I looked at http://code.google.com/intl/fr-FR/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html.\nMy dhclient.conf is pretty big (58 lines), so I posted it on pastebin.\nHowever, here is the entire dhclient.conf without comment lines or blank lines:\noption rfc3442-classless-static-routes code 121 = array of unsigned integer 8;\nsend host-name \"<hostname>\";\nrequest subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n    domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n    netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,\n    rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers;\nprepend domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;\n\nI am using wvdial instead of Network Manager.\n\nA: In 12.04, resolvconf is installed by default. Here is a quick summary of how to make DNS configuration changes for some common use cases:\nFor a static configuration using ifup, use dns-nameservers and dns-search entries in /etc/network/interfaces.\nFor a static configuration using NetworkManager, select the Automatic (DHCP) addresses only Method and enter addresses and domain names in the Additional DNS servers and Additional search domains fields in the Connection Editor.\nTo override resolvconf's default configuration, use base, head and tail in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/. Only enter addresses and domain names in these files as a temporary measure, since they really belong elsewhere, as described above.\nDisabling resolvconf is not recommended, but you can replace the symlink /etc/resolv.conf with a regular file.\nFor more information, see Stéphane Graber's blog post.\n\nA: If all you want to do is to keep your Google DNS servers in resolv.conf, you can edit\n/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and add :\nprepend domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;\nprepend domain-name-servers 8.8.4.4;\n\nThe only difference between what you have and what I'm showing here is that you've got both name-servers on a single line, per the docs you've mentioned.   \nUnless I'm missing something, your dhclient.conf is not a problem here. \nAt this point, I'm assuming that the issue has to do with wvdial. \nHere's something to try, from ubuntuforums:\ngksudo gedit /etc/ppp/peers/wvdial\n\nREMOVE parameter usepeerdns and save file.\nCode:\ngksudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf\n\nadd these lines:\ncheck DNS = no\nauto DNS = no\n\n\nA: The best way to set a nameserver via the CLI, without NetworkManger, with a static address, or independent of the connection is this:\nInstall the resolvconf package.\nRun \nsudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n\n(ignore the scary warning. /etc/resolv.conf is autogenerated, so the warning is there so it will get put in /etc/resolv.conf when /etc/resolv.conf is generated.) To the end of the file, add\n nameserver <ip_of_nameserver>\n\nPress Ctrl x and answer yes to saving the file. To finish up, regenerate /etc/resolv.conf so the changes are applied right now:\n sudo resolvconf -u\n\n\nA: You could set the domain-name-servers dhclient.conf option.\n\nA: I resolved the same problem with the following commands:\necho \"nameserver 212.217.0.1\" >> /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\nln -s /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head /etc/resolv.conf\nresolvconf -u\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\nA: you propably have the packet resolvconf installed. in that case, whenever an interface comes up, the resolv.conf is updated.\nyou can add static entries using the /etc/resolv.conf.tail file, see the man page for resolv.conf for more.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, the DNS server that my mobile provider provides was rather poor so I wanted to use Google's DNS. Also NetworkManager does a really poor job of handling mobile broadband connections so wvdial is a necessity.\nAs it turns out the /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link in ubuntu 12.10 and maybe even 12.04. Here's what I've done\nsudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf after this you can create a new resolv.conf with vim or the editor of your choice and add google's nameservers or any other nameservers that you prefer. Save it and you're done.\nIf you're afraid of breaking something you can make a note of the existing symlink by doing a ls -la /etc/resolv.conf before unlinking it.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Get flash drive to cache disk reads to primary partition Basically I'm looking for a way to mimic Windows' ReadyBoost.\nI asked this question on Unix.SE to get an idea of whether this was even possible and it seems like it is.

CacheFiles has only been implemented for NFS so far.  Another upcoming possibility is CleanCache.  Currently CleanCache only has two backends: one for xen tmem, and one for storing cached pages in compressed ram.  Hopefully a third backend will be written to store the cached pages on block devices like flash drives.\n\nA: Actually, it looks like it might be fairly easy.  apt-get install cachefilesd and read the documentation.\n", "Q: Why don't some cursor themes show up in GNOME? I have many cursor themes on my system that don't show up in GNOME's list of themes, yet work fine in other desktop environments (XFCE, LXDE, KDE, etc). What can I do to get these to show up? . Is there some way to fix this?\n\nA: I don't know if it handles pointers or not, but you could try a GTK appearance app like LXAppearance in lieu of the Gnome theme app. \n\nA: I still can't find a fix, but I have a feeling this one won't get far as a bug report in GNOME (it seems to be related to older themes or something, and GNOME is wierd).\nSo, in light of that, here is the solution I found (not perfect, but at least I can use the theme I want).\n\n\n*\n\n*press alt+f2, type “gconf-editor” and run it.\n\n*navigate (no need for a map here) to /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse\n\n*double click on the cursor theme entry\n\n*type the name of the cursor theme you want to use\n\n*close the editor\n\n*you may have to log out and in again, depending on your window manager\n\n*if you are using compiz, the above may be necessary to see the changes in full, even though the theme may appear to be loaded.\n\n", "Q: Good business card creation software? Anyone have good business card creation software? \nI found this good solutions for the creation of business cards; gLabels, inkscape and Libreoffice. But are they the only solutions? \n\n\n*\n\n*Printing Labels and Business Cards in Ubuntu\nMaybe someone else has some more suggestions?\n\nA: gLabels (Click To Install)\n\ngLabels is a program for creating labels and business cards for the GNOME desktop environment. It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label and business card sheets that you'll find at most office supply stores. gLabels is free software and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). \n\n\nYou can export to PDF by clicking Print and then clicking Save to File.\n\n\n\nA: There are other options, I use scribus with the pdfjam utility and Latex, the master page feature of scribus lends itself well to this kind of thing. \nUsually when you create business cards you want multiple cards to appear on a single sheet for printing but you want to work with just one card page when editing. here is how to accomplish this with some other tools.\nSCRIBUS WITH PDFJAM\nInstall the pdfjam package, this requires texlive and the texlive-latex-recommended packages, Install scribus-ng.\nStart scribus-ng and set Document Layout to Single Page, set Default Unit to inches, set page Width to 3.5 inches set page Height to 2.0 inches. this is for U.S. card, set Number Of Pages to 10. set all Margin Guides to 0.125 inch, click OK.\n\nClick the edit menu, in the list click Master Pages, a box with the master pages will pop up, there will be a default master page called Normal already there and will be selected for you, start adding text and graphics to this page, you will not need to edit any other pages, everything that you placed on this page will appear on every page in the document that the master is applied to, by default this one is applied to every page.\n\nYou can import a wide variety of vector graphics including svg files created with inkscape you can also add bitmap graphics such as photos.\nSave the scribus document, close the Master Pages dialog, click the save as pdf button on the scribus toolbar, a 10 page pdf of the document will be saved in the location you selected.\n\ngo to the folder where you saved the pdf document and run pdfjam on it like this:\npdfjam --nup 2x5 --papersize '{8.5in,11in}' --noautoscale true card.pdf -o 10upcard.pdf\n\nIf your pdf saved by scribus was called card.pdf a document called 10upcard.pdf will be created with all pages in card.pdf imposed on a letter sized sheet ready for printing. this can be printed on Avery 8371 or your own card stock.\nIf you want a border around the cards you can run the command below:\npdfjam --nup 2x5 --papersize '{8.5in,11in}' --noautoscale true --frame true card.pdf -o 10upb.pdf\n\nThis is useful when you want a cutting guide when you are not using perforated card stock from suppliers like Avery.\n\nOutput of pdfjam showing six of the imposed cards\nUSING LATEX\nUse is made of the latex put command to enable latex with a small amount of code to make fairly good looking simple business cards, see the following link for some examples you can download http://www-ece.rice.edu/gsc/bus_cards/bus_cards.html\n\nA: The only software that I've found that works for printing cards is Photoprint, and now that has mysteriously stopped communicating with my Ubuntu supported printer.\nNeither Glabels nor Scribus can print correctly.\nSo it looks like, \"No, there is no useful software available anymore if you want to print cards in Ubuntu.\"\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not recognize my built-in monitor I've recently discovered of a boot problem Ubuntu has with my laptop. I have successfully installed Ubuntu on two other computers, and I've never experienced this problem. What happens is, after the live boot CD loads, the screen goes completely blank. Although, I suspected that there was no problem booting, so I loaded with BIOS only, which worked perfectly fine. Of course, not being very proficient with this, I have no idea what needs to be done to fix the problem.\nI have switchable graphics cards(the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650, and some low-end Intel card), and an Intel i5 quad core processor. I was booting with the Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit desktop distribution. If there's any more information you need from me, please let me know.\nEDIT: I was able to look into this a bit more, thanks to one of the comments provided, and I have some new information. Ubuntu does seem to be able to recognize both of my graphics cards. The problem I found was that, in the Xorg.0 log, it mentions that there were \"no screens found.\" I'm using a notebook, so the screen is built in. Does anyone know of a way to get Ubuntu to recognize the monitor?\n\nA: Try totally removing one of your cards, or disabling the build in if exists from your bios. When you see the picture of the keybord = a picture of a guy in the beggining press any key and try to load any available modules for your relevant graphic card (my wild guess is that one of them will work with the standar installation) to continue the boot process. An output or a more detailed description would be helpful.\n", "Q: How can I prevent an app from leaving full screen mode when I move the cursor to another display?

This applies to both the application and also to any Flash video that may be playing in full screen mode.\nIs there any way to retain full screen mode and mouse out of the display?\n\nA: I don't know if this hack helps, but I've set up short-cuts using System >> Preferences >> Keyboard Short-cuts with: \nCTRL+F1 for desktop 1,\nCTRL+F2 for desktop 2,\nCTRL+F3 for desktop 3,\nCTRL+F4 for desktop 4, etc...\nas this allows me to shift between the desktops even when applications/programs are in full screen mode (F11). \n", "Q: Is there a way to grep the gnome-terminals history? Is the terminals output (i.e. not commands) history hiding somewhere that lets me do something like.. \ngrep \"foo foo \\d{5}\" ~/.terminal\n\nI'm aware I can simply pipe stuff to grep, or save it to a file rather than putting it in the terminal. It's just that sometimes I've had a program output some stuff I'd like to search through but would rather not rerun it just for greps benefit. :)\n\nA: The output is not stored in any files, no. But you can use the script command to record a terminal session. Just run\nscript\n\nThen run your commands as usual. When you type exit, you will exit the script program. All input and output can then be found in a file named typescript in your current directory. You can use less -R typescript to read and search through it.\nAs usual, it's a good idea to read the manual before using a new command. man script\n", "Q: Remember folder location in Chrome When I upload a file in Chrome, Chrome only remembers the PARENT folder when I continue with a next file.

Update Chrome to the latest version in case it was a bug that has been fixed.\nSecondly, I tested on various sites and it works fine, remembering the last location I was in for a Browse. I would guess that it's probably the site you're trying to upload to; it's probably coded to go to the parent folder by mistake.

Is there a way to set the gnome-terminal title from within the terminal itself without having to right click on the tab. Something like:\nactive-terminal --title \"Foo\"\n\nThere was a related question previously with an answer that almost lets you do this: How to change Gnome-Terminal title? but that doesn't set the gnome-terminal tab title only the window title.\n\nA: The following will set the terminal's title to \"New terminal title\":\necho -en \"\\033]0;New terminal title\\a\"\n\nYou will probably also have to change the environment variable PS1, first though, otherwise your changes won't show up because it will reset the title after each command. The default .bashrc that ships with Ubuntu contains the following line:\nPS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n\n... the \"\\e]0;\" code tells it to write everything up to the \"\\a\" in both the title and icon-name properties. You need to remove that and set it to something like this (i.e. without the \\e]0; code):\nPS1=\"${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h \\w\\a$ \"\n\nThen any changes that you make with the above echo command will change the terminal title. If you're going to use this a lot, you can throw it into a function in your ~/.bashrc file:\nset_term_title(){\n   echo -en \"\\033]0;$1\\a\"\n}\n\nThen you can just set the title to \"kittens\" from the command line by doing:\nset_term_title kittens\n\n(You have to restart bash though after editing .bashrc, for your changes to take effect)\n\nA: Function declarations don't work in all shells, so another approach is to declare an alias like so:\nalias cd    'cd \\!*; echo -en \"\\033]0;`pwd`\\a\"'\n\nThis command in particular causes the title to change to whatever the pwd is.\nOf course you will want to initialize the title when you start the terminal, so don't forget to include gnome-terminal --title.\nI use a perl script to helps me determine all the argument values first and then it invokes a new terminal like so: \nmy $cmd = \"gnome-terminal $window_with_profile $geometry $zoom $working_directory $temp_argv $title &\";\nsystem($cmd);\n\nBut how you want to initialize those values is up to you... \nYour welcome to take the following code and tweak it for your own personal use if you want:\n    #!/usr/bin/perl\n    #use strict;\n    use Getopt::Long;\n\n    my $progName = \"term.pl\";\n\n    =pod\n\n    =head1 OBJECTIVE: open a gnome-terminal with a given path and a new background color\n\n     #1# In order to use this script you first need to set up 10 different terminal profiles each named \"theme1\" - \"theme10\"\n        Edit... profiles... new... theme1\n        Each theme should use a different color scheme...\n\n     The themes are later called with --window-with-profile=theme$int\n     This script then selects the next one one to open based on the number saved in the ~/.term_theme_counter file.\n\n     ### The argument \".\" opens the terminal with the same dir as you are currently in. \n         Without it, the terminal opens to \"~\".

When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nIf the problem still exist, then edit dpkg status file\ngksudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/status   \n\nFind the package in question, and remove everything that has anything to do with it >and save the file.1\n\n1Source:Ubuntu fix\n\nA: Open a terminal and try this command\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nIt will fix all broken packages. after this you can install any s/w you want.\n\nA: When upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04.1,\nI had a problem with broken packages, and when trying all the common things like apt-get -f install, I got an error, something like E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1).\nInstead of reinstalling and spending hours setting things up, I got my hands dirty, and eventually fixed. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synaptic uses apt-get underhood. Go use that apt-get at console. Figure out what commands are used by Synaptic, or which to use.\n\n*apt-get uses dpkg internally. If it tells dpkg ended with an error, try to do the operation with dpkg directly, you'll see the actual error.\n\n*dpkg stores it's metadata in /var/lib/dpkg/info/. In my case, it had problems with samba-libs, installing (corrupted archive) or removing (metadata missing -> saying it's not installed). So I deleted the metadata. Then ran dpkg --clear-avail. Then downloaded the library, put to the place instead of the corrupted file. Then apt-get update.  Then dpkg --install <path-to-lib>. And then it started working.\n", "Q: Network connection on an Acer Aspire 5253?

I shifted to Ubuntu 10.10 now I am facing problem to have C/C++ compiler. What are the possible ways so that I can use C/C++ compiler using all the libraries (like graphic, math, conio, stdlib, etc) as in Microsoft Windows creating executable file?\n\nA: The below is (1) a simple hello-world program (2) compiled (3) made executable (4) executed. If you don't have the compiler, install gcc and g++ using the software install gui, or by running this command: sudo apt-get install gcc g++\njake@daedalus:~/playground$ cat hello.cc \n// 'Hello World!' program \n\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n  std::cout << \"Hello World!\" << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\njake@daedalus:~/playground$ g++ hello.cc -o hello\njake@daedalus:~/playground$ chmod +x hello\njake@daedalus:~/playground$ ./hello \nHello World!\njake@daedalus:~/playground$\n\n\nA: You could install the c++ compiler via terminal.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nTo write your code there a lot of editors like Gedit (installed by default) or Emacs. If you need an Integrated development environment, you could use Anjuta for example.\nsudo apt-get install anjuta anjuta-extras\n\nSee: How to Compile a C/C++ Program on Ubuntu Linux\nGerman list with IDEs\n\nA: Ubuntu provides the standard Gnu Compiler Collection in the repositories.\nYou can install the Gnu C Compiler gcc  as well as the Gnu C++ compiler g++  with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install gcc g++\n\nYou'll probably also want to install libc6-dev  (which includes the C standard library) and libstdc++6-4.5-dev  (which includes the standard C++ libraries).\n\nIf you're looking for something comparable to Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler, try taking a look at Qt - specifically Qt Creator . It's a full-fledged IDE with a visual form designer, code-editor, and debugger.\n\n\n\nEdit:\nNow that it's clear what you mean by \"perfectly as in Microsoft windows?\", then Qt Creator (which I mentioned above) will be perfect for your needs. You won't need to use the console to compile your applications and the Qt framework is easy to learn and use.\nThere's a great tutorial for getting started with Qt here.\n\nA: GNU's gcc\nIt's present in all Linux/Unix distributions.\nUsage:\ngcc hello.c\n\nThat's the compiler, but if your question is actually directed towards an IDE, then there are a couple I could recommend:\nQtCreator\nAnjunta\nEclipse for C/C++\n...and the list goes on...\n\nA: gcc(GNU Compiler Collection) is one of the most widely used C compilers. Ubuntu uses gcc and is installed by default when you install it on your system. Type gcc <filename> and g++ filename on the terminal to compile C and C++ programs respectively.\n\nA: Generally, Ubuntu comes with C and C++ compiler. If you have specific requirement for some compiler then you can find and install it. If not available you can install by doing this,\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nAs for writing codes, there are different IDEs available. The one that I use is Eclipse IDE for C,C++ developer http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/junor. If you use IDEs then IDEs will take care of compiling program for you through their GUI but you can also build a code from command line as mentioned in detailed over here http://www.wikihow.com/Compile-a-C/C%2B%2B-Program-in-Ubuntu. Eclipse will also make your life easier when it comes to debugging your code.\nRegarding your question on how to open My Computer? You will have to tell me which version of ubuntu you are using and which desktop environment?\nFor battery do this,\nright-click on the status bar (generally on top) -> add to pannel\nI have added \"Indicator applet complete\" and then you should have battery indicator.\n\nA: You can write your program in many ways .\nIf you like terminal text editors then vim and nano are there . If you like GUI text editors gedit is enough for basic users .\nso i hope you know how to write a program . For example with Gedit . you can find it by typing as gedit in your unity dash which can activate by pressing Super key on your keyboard .\nafter opening it , type your program there and save it where you want . \nActually you should have a package named as build-essential to run your C/C++ programs succesfully . if you not installed it then you can with \nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nfrom your terminal . as you said you are a basic Ubuntu users and of course new to Ubuntu, you can get your terminal by typing as terminal in your Unity dash as i suggested above .\nAfter saving your program to run it you have to follow these intructions to RUN it .\n g++ /path/to/file_name.cpp -o <give some name >\n./<give some name >\n\n.hope that helps.\n\nA: I would suggest looking into CodeBlocks IDE. its cross platform and should be available in the Ubuntu app store.\n\n", "Q: How do I install the ath5k driver?

If it's meant to be a compile-it-yourself module, you're in for a bit of work but nothing insurmountable.\n\nA: I suggest you firstly unzip the zip folder you mention. In Linux you only have to right click the folder and choose open with archiver, this will generate a plain folder of the same name.

I often update my system with apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade. This caused me a few problems with natty and nvidia drivers.\nSomeone on IRC told me that's because I did a partial upgrade, but I did not know.\nHow do I know if apt-get is going to do a partial upgrade?\n\nA: Typically you should be wary of using \"dist-upgrade\" during the development release, if the archive is in an inconsistent state it will remove things and this will happen. This always isn't easy as you might have upgraded part of the system and the bits that they depend on might not be build yet. \nNormally when this occurs packages to be \"held back\", but a dist-upgrade overrides that and just installs the newest things in the archive, whether that breaks your computer or not.\nThe simplest way you can recover is find out what you're missing and reinstall it, I would guess in your case you upgraded either X, nvidia, and/or your kernel and your mirror wasn't caught up or the right things weren't built yet. This is why I always upgrade with \"apt-get upgrade\" or the update-manager and just let things sit held back for a while.\nWhat I do is do apt-get upgrade, then when certain things are held back I apt-get install them one at a time. So for example kernel packages will be held back and I manually install them. If something wants to remove something that looks important I keep it held back. It's not too time consuming and ensures that something important isn't removed.\n\nA: It's obviously a little bit manual, but you can also check the build status of Natty generally with this link.\nIf I see NVidia or Kernel related packages in there, I tend not to do the upgrade, as it will usually result in breakage if you either use dist-upgrade, or use the update-manager and ignore its warnings about partial upgrades.\nI'm also very wary of any upgrade that wants to remove packages.  It's reasonably rare and you should be careful of updating if large numbers of packages are set to be removed.\n", "Q: Trackpad Mimic Apple's Command Click I have a laptop that has a trackpad for the mouse.

My question is why is bzip2 even needed to turn the .patch into a .patch.bz2? Is it for the redirection to std output from the -dc option for the patch command? Even if it is, why not just not just use the patch command in the form something like this:patch -p1 < patchfile? I don't see why the bzip2 is done here.\nAlso, I think the bzip2 might have an extra space in the command after web100/, right?\n\nA: *\n\n*Correct, there does appear to be an extra space character in web100/ web100 that should not be there and will break the command.\n\n*I agree, there appears to be no obvious reason for using bzip2 in the example.

My clock starts running out of sync in Ubuntu which doesn't happen in Windows. The problem is that it just starts losing time after a moment of syncing it with an NTP server, that means the clock is broken. \nSo How can I make the system use the hardware clock instead(I tried adjtimex).\nBTW: please don't suggest the CMOS battery, it's not the correct answer.\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu only sets the time when a network interface comes up.  It does this with a small piece of the \"ntp\" system: ntpdate.   If your machine stays connected and keeps running for days or weeks, even the best internal clock will eventually go out of sync.\nUbuntu also doesn't try to adjust your internal clock by default, and it sounds like your clock is badly adjusted.  The real time clock (hardware clock) in most systems is also not very good over the long term.\nSo if you want better time, I can recommend two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the full \"ntp\" package to get the Network Time Protocol, which regularly looks at Internet time servers and keeps your clock within milliseconds of the right time.   See some good instructions here: Install NTP....  You can also install it from the Ubuntu Software Center.  This is easy and typically pretty foolproof, if your machine is usually on the Internet and doesn't have really nasty firewalls cutting off ntp.\n\n*Manually adjust the frequency of your internal clock, using the adjtimex package.  Actually, when you install adjtimex, it runs adjtimexconfig which sets values in /etc/default/adjtimex.  But it does so quickly using the hardware clock, and in my experience the results are usually somewhere between bad and terrible.  Some machines are hard to tune well, but I've had good luck with most of my machines by doing the manual calculation necessary to figure out the right FREQ and TICK values to put in /etc/default/adjtimex.  To go this route, start by installing adjtimex via Applications/Ubuntu Software Center.  To figure out manual settings for FREQ and TICK, see the nice calculator at Tuning with adjtimex as an alternative to running ntpd.  That page also notes that your choice of \"clocksource\" can affect how accurate your clock is.  The hpet (High Precision Event Timer) seems more accurate than the tsc (Time Stamp Counter).\nThere are tips for dealing with other glitches at UbuntuTime - Help.ubuntu.com\n\nA: I'm not sure things work the way you're describing. I.e., there are no \"software\" clock process/application which either uses BIOS clock or an ntp server and which can be \"broken\" in Ubuntu but working in Windows. In any case the info you see on the screen comes from BIOS clock.\nIf NTP server is enabled, the data coming from it is used to adjust the BIOS/hardware clock, and, when the hardware clock is thought to be \"incorrect\", NTP daemon adjusts time gradually in small increments instead of setting it straight away. This is done to avoid sudden \"jumps\" in system time which may cause all sorts of trouble (i.e. an event which happens after some other event but at earlier time).\nWhich perfectly explains the behaviour you're seeing - as soon as the \"correct\" data comes from the NTP server, the daemon starts gradually adjusting your system time.\nI think your timezone/daylight saving time may be set incorrectly. Another possibility may be that Ubuntu expects the BIOS clock to be set to UTC time while Windows sets the clock in your local timezone, which results in Ubuntu thinking your system clock are late/early by your GMT offset\nThis document may be helpful: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Multiple%20Boot%20Systems%20Time%20Conflicts\n\nA: Go to system/preferences/time and date, then unlock the settings by clicking on the little padlock.\n\nChange your configuration to \"manual\" (that's the default, unless you've installed NTP) and then manually update your system time to whatever you need.\n", "Q: How can I download Youtube videos?

What's the difference between the Server version of Ubuntu and the Desktop version?\n\nA: It's worth noting that other than the kernel settings, Ubuntu Desktop and Server are essentially the same distribution, just with different default package selection.  They both use the same packages and respositories.  If you run apt-get install ubuntu-desktop you will end up with the functional equivalent of Desktop Edition.\nThat also means that any package that's intended for Ubuntu Server will run just as happily on your desktop installation.\n\nA: Whether you install using a server CD, or a desktop CD, you end up with the same Ubuntu.  The difference is in what selection of packages it installs by default - that is - what software selection you end up with at the end of the installation process.\nIt is possible to move from a desktop system to a server system and vice-versa on an already-installed copy of Ubuntu.  Ubuntu even makes it relatively easy with the tasksel utility or with meta-packages like ubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-server (available through the standard apt package manager at least as of 16.04).  You can even mix and match - installing a desktop environment on a server or server software such as ssh_server or apache2 on a primarily desktop computer.\nBut chances are, you probably already know at install time whether you want a desktop system complete with desktop environment, or a server system.  So having different installation CDs for server and desktop is simply a convenience factor that makes software selection just a bit simpler.\nThe installers also behave differently, in the sense that only the \"desktop\" version installs from a graphical Live CD.  The other versions install using a menu-based installer similar to Debian's installer.\n\nA: Copied as-is from Ubuntu docs:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first difference is in the CD contents. The \"Server\" CD avoids including what Ubuntu considers desktop packages (packages like X,\nGnome or KDE), but does include server related packages (Apache2,\nBind9 and so on). Using a Desktop CD with a minimal installation and\ninstalling, for example, apache2 from the network, one can obtain the\nexact same result that can be obtained by inserting the Server CD and\ninstalling apache2 from the CD-ROM.\n\n*The Ubuntu Server Edition installation process is slightly different from the Desktop Edition. Since by default Ubuntu Server\ndoesn't have a GUI, the process is menu driven, very similar to the\nAlternate CD installation process.\n\n*Before 12.04, Ubuntu server installs a server-optimized kernel by default. Since 12.04, there is no difference in kernel between Ubuntu\nDesktop and Ubuntu Server since linux-image-server is merged into\nlinux-image-generic.\n\n*For Ubuntu LTS releases before 12.04, the Ubuntu Desktop Edition only receives 3 years of support. This was increased to 5 years in\nUbuntu LTS 12.04 In contrast, all Ubuntu LTS Server Edition releases\nare supported for 5 years.\n\n\n\nA: Note :\nThis is not my answer. I found this on Quora, and found that better than the ones here. Here is the original answer https://qr.ae/pNyxJm.\nI will never mess up Desktop version with Server version and vise versa.\nThis 5 cent tip comes out from real experiences and lessons I paid with couple days time on struggling to make a use of Server version as terminal only box.\nIt is true that you can always add Desktop packages on Server version or vise versa. But the result are quite different from respective versions, it has many problems and troubles.\nMost people noticed that the difference of packages Server and Desktop versions have, but no one pay attention that these two versions have quite different configurations. The problems of miss-use versions caused by different configuration are elided or ignored.\nThe Server version is meant for server. Here are at least two things that affect you when you use Server version as your daily terminal console box: It is optimized for the server, assuming always has a wired network, always are power on (it does not reboot often). So your box will have much longer boot time. If you use WiFi only machine (most new style laptops do), the Server version of Ubuntu boot-up procedure can hang on there for 3 to 5 minutes, because lot modules on server depend on network when load it, but at that stage, WiFi network is not available yet, indeed, the Server version default setting doesn’t come with whole WiFi package.\nThese are only two little things that could catch you and give you headache. Try searching online for Ubuntu hangs on boot…. The solution for that is cumbersome and not clean. oh, I did not mention the users you created on Server version on terminal console won’t shown-up on Desktop login GUI if later you add Desktop packages, nor the GUI Users manage utilities. …. just another issue in the list.\nSo I will say Server and Desktop version are different enough that you do not miss-use them, although you can add packages to get certain features from other version, you will encounter problems caused by different configuration.\nAlthough by saying that, I would suggest to use Desktop version for most of case, adding Server packages to Desktop version won’t affect much of your daily usage experience. You can easily change setting to disable GUI and use it as Terminal console. Use the Server version for server solely.\nWhat we really lack is Ubuntu Terminal version: A version that is light, but optimized for daily laptop terminal usages only.\n", "Q: Upgrade 10.04LTS to 10.10 problem Checking for a new ubuntu release\nDone Upgrade tool signature\nDone Upgrade tools \nDone downloading            \nextracting 'maverick.tar.gz'\nauthenticate 'maverick.tar.gz' against 'maverick.tar.gz.gpg' \ntar: Removing leading `/' from member names\n\nReading cache\n\nChecking package manager\nReading package lists...

(I mean, for it still to be found by BIOS when I press F9/Activate BootBooster.) Partition table order? Partition type? Flags? Label? UUID?\n\n\n*Can I make it a logical (instead of primary) partition?\n\n\n*Must it be the flagged as boot?\nMost importantly: Where can I find any official documentation about it? I've already seen much (mis)information about it. Some say Boot Booster partition must be last (in partition table), some say Recovery must be 2nd, that it must be bootable, etc. How can I know what is really needed for the BIOS to use both F9 and Boot Booster?\nNote: I'm using GParted from a Live USB Stick (Mint 10 / Ubuntu 10.10), and I've noticed that, since the filesystem type of the Boot Booster is not recognized, it can't move or resize it. Can I delete it and re-create it somewhere else? Whenever I create a 0xEF partition GParted crashes and quits and I cannot open it again (must delete the partition using fdisk / cfdisk).\n\nA: I have an eeePC 1000HE and have partitioned it many times. First I must say that if you think to delete this 2 little partitions you will lose your boot booster and it will boot with  \"ASUS\" gray boot screen instead of quick black screen.(which is very important and will give you at least 10 sec. of advantage in booting time) I do not recommend you to move, to delete or to touch this parts.\nI have triple boot (Ubuntu netbook 10.04, Meego and XP).You can make partitions with Gparted and with XP hard disk manager without touching those parts. \n", "Q: Twinview broken on upgrade to 10.10 I have been on 9.10 for over a year on the grounds that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. However, I had a spare weekend and figured it was probably about time...\nI performed an upgrade to 10.4, and everything seemed to proceed smoothly, so I took the plunge and went for 10.10.\nDisaster.\nMy twinview Nvidia display which had been working perfectly is now broken. On boot everything seems fine, but when X starts and the second monitor springs into life the primary winks out and switches off - almost as if its been put into an unsupported display mode.\nThe system seems to think there's a second monitor - the nvidia logo is split across the two screens, but it can't seem to start.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swapping the monitors (one is older than the other, and its definitely the port not the actual monitor)\n\n*Rolling back to an old Xorg conf from prior to the upgrade\n\n*Installing a non-beta driver direct from Nvidia (this seems to start both monitors but then apparently stops boot and causes the second display to 'wink'. Twinview seems non-functional, both displays are mirrors)\n\n*Disabling EDID\n\n*Disabling twinview, logging in and attempting to use the Nvidia config to re-detect the monitors (second monitor is falsely detected and won't go higher than 1024x768. Selecting 'apply' causes one screen to go blank and the other to display garbage)\n\n*googling for about 5 hours looking for similar problems, none of the offered solutions seemed to work\n\n\nI'm at a loss, and it is looking very much like I'm going to have to go through a time consuming reinstall to downgrade back to the working 10.4. \nAny thoughts?\n\nA: I used TwinView on 10.10 without problems, so I think it's just an issue with old settings.\nTry deleting Xorg.conf altogether (that's okay to do, because no Xorg.conf file is default now), restarting, and then checking that your Hardware Drivers is selected on the recommended one, and setting up TwinView via the Nvidia tool once again.\n", "Q: ALT+SysRq+REISUB hangs at \"resetting\" (without actually resetting/restarting) I'm trying Alt + SysRq + REISUB to see how it would be used to restart my system safely in case of emergency.\nHowever, I find that Alt + SysRq + REISUB hangs at \"resetting\" (without actually resetting/restarting) in Maverick.\nAll other SysRq combinations appear to work correctly (i.e. Alt + SysRq + REISU).\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq returns 0. But I'm not sure it's relevant because Alt + SysRq certainly works.\nWhat can I do to have \"B\" actually restart the system?\n\nA: Alt + SysRq +\nR - takes keyboard and mouse control from the X server. This can be useful if the X-Server crashed, you can change to a console and kill the X-Server or check the error log.\nNOTE:- The documentation refers to this key's task as \"Turns off keyboard raw mode and sets it to XLATE\", but I suppose it's safe enough to assume that it takes back control from X.\nE - sends SIGTERM to all processes except init. This means that an attempt is done to end the current processes except init, safely, e.g. saving a document.\nI - sends SIGKILL to all processes except init. This means that all the processes except for init are killed, any data in processes that are killed will be lost.\nS - writes all data from the disc cache to the hard-discs, it is a sync and is necessary to reduce the chances of data corruption.\nU - remounts all mounted filesystems read-only. After using this key, you can reboot the system with Alt+SysRq+B without harming the system.\nB - restarts the system without making steps to ensure that the conditions are good for a safe reboot, using this key alone is like doing a cold reboot.\n\nTry without pressing R at begining of your sequence \nor just do it in another seq.. give a litle time between those keystrokes and do this..\nAlt + SysRq + R S E I U B\nand better you enable Magic SysRq by entering..\necho 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\n", "Q: ASUS EeePC Fn+F2 ruins wireless until restart I managed to get my wireless working beautifully (ath5k driver working great), and it works over a disable/enable wireless cycle, even a suspend/wakeup cycle (read some people have issues with that). Unfortunately, I discovered that if I press Fn+F2 on my keyboard (Asus EeePC 900HA, so that's the wireless toggle key), wireless then stops working until I restart the computer.\nHow can I fix this? I'm running UNR 10.10 (with Unity turned off tyvm!). I heard something about Jupiter controlling these keys, but what about asus-laptop? How can I fix this behaviour?\nTIA.\n(Note, I'm a power user, but still fairly new to Linux. I'm picking up speed though).\n\nA: I too have Maverick on a eee900A and I was having the same problem with the wireless.\nI found \nthis fix, it worked beatifully for me.\nHope it helps\nCiao\n\nA: I have an Asus EeePC myself too, the 1005PE, but im using Lucid 10.04 instead. Ive bought it soon after Lucid was released, and decided to stick with an LTS release. After all, netbooks have limited hardware, and i depend on it on a daily basis, for work and college, so bleeding edge is not needed, stability and long term support comes first.\nAt least in my particular combination, the Fn+F2 key works perfectly. I can (and i do) switch wireless on and off several times a day. Sometimes I have problems turning bluetooth on and off, requiring restart, but since Eee900 has no bluetooth, it shouldnt worry you.\nAlso, I didnt have to install any driver. The ones out-of-the-box recognized my harware, from touchpad to wifi and even bluetooth. \nSo, my suggestions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why not try Lucid 10.04? Its LTS, so it will be supported for 3 years instead of 18 months.\n\n*If you dont use Maverick's Unity, youre already missing the biggest change in that release. So Lucid will look very similat to what youre used to.\n\n*Power consumption in Lucid is smaller than Maverick. For a Netbook, battery life is crucial.\n\n*Ive downloaded and installed Jupiter. Not for the Fn keys, but for power management. I strongly recommend it. It really improved my battery life from 8 to 12 hours. HUGE improvement. Check out my answer on a similar question for some info about Jupiter. And yes, it also improved Fn control by enabling OSD Notifications for every Fn key, and it does have independent bluetooth and wireless enable, something my Fn keys do not.\nSo, why not try it? Lucid 10.04 + Jupiter may be your solution for the Fn+F2. Even if they dont, you wont lose much compared to your current setup (Maverick minus Unity is almost the same as Lucid), and you will get some side-benefits as well, battery life and LTS support to name a few.\nYou dont need to touch your HDD to try it... use a Live Session to see if Fn+F2 keys work. You can even install Jupiter in a Live Session. Or repartition your HDD to have them both installed side-by side until you feel safe about it.\n", "Q: Multiple shells in one window The default behavior of my shell window is to create tabs. I can switch between those tabs but only one tab can be visible at a time.\nIs it possible to open multiple shells in the same window? E.g. have a window split 4-ways with each pane running it's own instance of a shell. I would prefer this over tabs since I can run my shell window full-screen at see 4 shells at the same time.\n\nA: screen (not installed by default) is some kind of a window manager for text mode that can split your shell window into multiple regions each displaying another shell. If you like working with a shell screen is for sure worth having a look at.\n\nA: I prefer using tmux, since it's highly customizable. tmux is installed by default on Ubuntu Server\nTo install tmux on Ubuntu Desktop, use:\nsudo apt install tmux\n\nSome of the default keyboard shortcuts on tmux can be a little tricky. I like some small modification to start with.\nAdd the following lines to the default config ~/.tmux.conf:\n# set prefix to control-f\nset -g prefix C-f\n\n#unbind system defined prefix\nunbind C-b\n\n# horizontal split\nbind \"'\" split-window -h\n\n# vertical split\nbind - split-window -v\n\nThis changes the default shortcut to Ctrl+F instead of Ctrl+B.\nIn addition, it changes the horizontal and vertical split functions to the ' and - keys, because they are quite intuitive and easy to remember.\nIn addition, the Universe repo has tmuxinator, which is a tool to create tmux sessions using an intuitive yaml configuration scheme. This is also highly recommended. Install with:\nsudo apt install tmuxinator\n\n\nA: terminator \n can do exactly this. It is available in the software center.\n\nA: It is probably worth mentioning separately that byobu is very close to being native Ubuntu.  Though it is an offshoot of screen, it is the project of Dustin Kirkland, one of the Ubuntu core developers.\nHis posts on byobu can be seen on his blog. .  \nAs @EvilPhoenix pointed out,  it does some cool things by default.  \nOne of the links that Dustin has on his site is a review from Vincent Danen.  It describes byobu as \n\na wrapper for the screen program that\n  bundles additional functionality and\n  custom plugins for an enhanced\n  experience working in the terminal.\n\nHere's Dustin and an actual byobu: \n\nOf course, whether or not you like byobu is a personal taste thing.

Assuming you are going to use the above mentioned command, you need to create the mount point first.  So using my above example of using a mount point of /media/mountPoint, you will need to do this command before you attempt to mount the drive:\nmkdir /media/mountPoint\nIf this command requires you to have superuser, prepend the mkdir command with sudo, which will allow the command to be run as superuser.\n\nA: Your USB 3.0 card may claim it has the NEC chipset, which is perfectly compatible with Linux, but lsusb output shows it has a (cheaper, less compatible) AsMedia chipset.

Hope it works for u.\n\nA: I wasn't able to get my HDD to work at all when I plugged in a USB 3.0 ExpressCard after the machine had booted. I read somewhere that Ubuntu doesn't seem to detect the ExpressCard properly if the machine is already running, and detects them properly if it's inserted before you turn on the machine.\nSo basically, try booting with the ExpressCard already inserted, and see if your Hard Drive operates properly after that.\n", "Q: Disk failing on Dell Mini, are there diagnostic tools? my dell mini 10v running Ubuntu 10.10 runs ok for hours, but then will suddenly slow down drastically.

It does not work with a XML-typed description file but with GTK-commands that you invoke from the bash commandline. Very powerful indeed :-)\ngtkdialog is not in the repositories anymore but you can fins the latest versions in a PPA (https://launchpad.net/~dnjl/+archive/build/+sourcepub/2986274/+listing-archive-extra)\ngtkserver has no PPA or deb AFAIK so this has to be compiled from source.\n\nA: Yad may be useful in this regard, it is a fork of zenity with more features, one of them the ability to create forms.\nHere is a very simple example of a form:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nfrmdata=$(yad --title \"Test Form\" --form --field \"Address\" --field=\"Name\")\n\n\nfrmaddr=$(echo $frmdata | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"|\" } { print $1 }')\nfrmname=$(echo $frmdata | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"|\" } { print $2 }')\n\necho $frmaddr > test.txt\necho $frmname >> test.txt\n\nThe above script will display a form like this:\n\nAfter you enter your data and click ok or hit enter on the keyboard, the form data will be written to a text file called test.txt, I am using awk to separate the form data which is a string with a pipe as field separator, I believe there is a direct way to get the data without awk but I am no yad expert, please check the project home and ask questions, you may find a more elegant way.\nHow to get and install yad here:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/12/yad-zenity-on-steroids-display.html\nyad project home:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/yad/\nmore examples here:\nhttp://technostripe.com/yad-a-fork-of-zenity-with-more-features/\nhttp://code.google.com/p/yad/wiki/Examples\nI am late here but this may still be helpful.\n\nA: One solution would to use Zenity, but just display each prompt individually. The first prompt would be for the first field, and then when the user clicks \"Ok\", you could prompt for the second field.\nIt sounds like you might be reaching the limits of scripting, and might want to look into developing an application-like interface using something like QT or GTK.\n\nA: You may want to try CommandUI.

Additionally, if you are viewing a video that uses rtsp, then it won't be stored anywhere. is not the case for YouTube tho. The video should be in the browser cache folder.\n\nA: It depends on the browser and on the version of flash player you use.\nOn Chrome with flash 10, it is usually under  ~/.cache/google-chrome/Cache; similarly for Firefox, it is ~/.mozilla/firefox/<id>.default/Cache.\n\nA: Youtube videos are usually cached in /tmp for me.

I know that in bash you can set up aliases in a .bash_aliases file, so that the command you type doesn't need to be a command stored in the binaries in the system.  Is there any way I can get aliases into zsh?\n\nA: You can do it by the \"alias\" command with this syntax:\nalias [ -gmrL ] [ name[=value] ... ]\n\nFor \"gmrL\" switches, see this guide, which is my reference.\nFor each name, with no value, zsh will print the name and what it is aliased to previously. With no arguments at all, alias prints the values of ALL defined aliases.\nTo define one or more aliases, simply enter:\nalias name1=value1 name2=value2 ... nameX=valueX\n\nFor each name with a corresponding value, zsh defines an alias with that value. For further info, check out that link. ;-)\n\nA: I go back and forth between bash and zsh, and use the same .aliases file for both. They share the same basic alias syntax, so you can create a .aliases file and link it to .bashrc and .zshrc:\n.bashrc\nif [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.aliases\nfi\n\n.zshrc\nsource $HOME/.aliases\n\nFWIW this can also be done with environment variable declarations, in a separate .env file.\n\nA: I was trying some things and I found a way to use my aliases created in bash into zsh, only I had to copy these lines from bashrc:\nif [-f ~ / .bash_aliases]; then\n. ~ / .bash_aliases\nfi\n\n\nA: You generally put them in ~/.zshenv.  But many programs use /bin/sh (usually bash) instead of $SHELL to execute shell commands, so for it to work everywhere you will probably need to put the bash equivalent of the alias into ~/.bash_aliases anyway.\n\nA: .zshrc\nadd this line at the bottom of the file (assuming that your aliases located in ~/.profile):\nsource ~/.profile\n\n\nA: If anyone find this useful: My situation is that I have a Macbook Laptop, Ubuntu Laptop, Ubuntu Desktop and couple of Ubuntu VMs. In all of them I want to use defaults (so Bash in Ubuntu and Zsh in OSX) but with same aliases.\nThe way I handle it is that I have my alias file .bash_aliases in git repo called dotfiles.

You can use source instead of . if it means more to you; . is the traditional Bourne and Korn shell name, however.\n\n\nA: I wrote this and put it in my ~/.bashrc a long time ago.

I have every kernel starting with the one packaged on the 10.04 LTS disc up to the most recent one (including the backported kernel).  There's no automated process to remove old kernels, so you'd have to remove each individual image from your system using Synaptic or some other package manager.\n\nA: A detailed procedure for removing old Linux kernels and cleaning up Ubuntu's boot menu to use just the latest and next most recent kernels is provided in a series of recent posts starting with GRUB2 revisited.\nWhile the procedures listed in the above are all manual, one of the web references listed refers to a number of graphic tools that may be useful in modifying the boot menu.

To return firefox to the default desktop, just replace the 1 with a 0 at the end of the command. To send a different window to another workspace, just replace firefox with another program name.\nIt is crucial you use %@ to represent the windows passed from the --search parameter, as if you don't no windows will be transferred.\nFor more information, see man xdotool and the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: Here is a script of mine that implements what you ask: https://github.com/norswap/wmov/blob/master/wmov.sh\nIn it's current form, it can send windows (selected by matching a case-insensitive string against substrings title, like for the wmctrl -r option) to other desktops, either by choosing an explicit desktop number, or by indicating the direction of the desktop from the current desktop.\nFor instance:\n./wmov.sh mov \"Google Chrome\" 3 # sends Chrome to desktop 3 (bottom left)\n./mov.sh mov Skype right # sends Skype to the desktop to the right of\n                         # the current desktop (if any)\n\nIt works indeed as described in desgua's post. It also the capabilities to send windows to other workspaces.\n\nA: If you are using compiz, then look here at the compiz wiki. There you find several examples. Look at the \"put\" plugin.\nExample\n./compiz-dbus-send.py put put_viewport_right_key\n\n\nA: If you are using a compliant window manager like Metacity (Unity 2-d) you can use wmctrl to switch a window to another desktop. The syntax is wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t <DESKTOP>. You can also change your current desktop using wmctrl -s <DESKTOP>. Desktop numbers start at 0. On one line, this would be:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t 1; wmctrl -s 1\n\nIf you want to switch a window other than the active one to another desktop, use text from the title as the argument to -r. For example:\nwmctrl -r \"Chromium\" -t 1\n\nAlternatively you can use wmctrl -l to list the available windows and pass the id number to -r instead of the special string :ACTIVE:. When passing an id, you also need to add -i. For example:\n$ wmctrl -l\n0x03e00189  0 hostname Ask Ubuntu - Chromium\n$ wmctrl -i -r 0x03e00189 -t 2\n\n(wmctrl can be installed on Ubuntu with sudo apt-get install wmctrl.) At present, this doesn't seem to work with standard Unity, unfortunately.\n\nA: Firstly, the colon is part of the :ACTIVE: magic token to indicate the active window.  You don't want it normally.  Second, you need to quote strings with spaces in them.\nYou can also get the window ID (the 0x... at the start of each line) and use that instead of trying to make the title work.\n$ wmctrl -r 'OMG!

PE/COFF \".exe\" for Microsoft Windows, .jar for Java Applets, PE32 \".exe\", ELF on Unix/Linux)\n\n*Application Programming Interface; (Eg. POSIX on Linux/Unix, Cocoa for Mac OSX, Win32 on Microsoft Windows, Base Class Library for \".Net\"/Mono applications).\n\n\nYou can increase the chance of matching all three by having emulators/interpreters (for other CPU instruction sets), by having extra file loaders (for foreign file-formats), and having additional programming libraries providing more APIs.\nNote also, that some processors can natively execute more than one instruction set;  a PC quite often has x86 and amd64 instruction sets;  an ARM processor can execute four: ARM32/Thumb/Java bytecode/ThumbEE.  Some operating systems can provide more than one API natively too (Microsoft Windows provides Win32 and POSIX).\nFor everything else you need extra software.  For running Java programs you need the three parts listed above to make it work:  a Java Virtual Machine program to run the bytecode; a way of launching Java programs, and a Java Classlibrary for the programs to call.  \"Java\" is a brandname here for several separate technologies originally developed by Sun, but to a user they are often downloaded as one.\nThe same applies for \".Net\", which is a marketing brandname for several different technologies originally developed by Microsoft:  The Common Language Run-time/Base Class Library (CLR) are the API; VES is the loader and Common Language Interface (CLI) is the instruction set.\nYou don't have to download those technologies from Microsoft, from Sun, or from Intel just because they originally invented something.  AMD make processors compatible with Intel's standards;  both Apache (\"Harmony\") and Google (\"Android Dalvik\") both make a Java-like suite;  and Mono provides a CLR/CLI/VES suite.  The important thing is that everyone uses the same standards, making them compatible.  A DVD disc will play on any DVD player that meets the standard, and an HTML webpage will rendering in any Web Browser meeting the HTML standards.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mono is a CLR/CLI/VES suite that can run on Mac OSX, MS Windows and Linux.\n\n*Wine is a Win32 API implementation that can run on Mac OSX, MS Windows and Linux.\n\n*You can run Mono on top of Wine, on top of any operating system.\n\n*You can run Wine on top of Qemu, on top of any CPU architecture.\n\n\nSo Mono makes CLR .exe applications run, and Wine makes Win32 .exe applications run.  The only thing in common is that the filenames end in \".exe\"; the contents are completely different and incompatible, so you need the right one.\nJust like a Python interpreter will error when presented with Perl (and vis versa), a CLR interpreter will error when presented with x86+Win32, or JVM+Java bytecode.  If you can post a link to the particular program that you're wanting to run, myself or somebody else should be able to tell you the exact instruction set, file format and API it was designed for, and what you need to install on Linux to run it.  Hope that helps!\n(Sometimes you might even need both.  For example, the Openbve train simulator is C# and compiled to PE/COFF+CLI+CLR, but can optionally use C binary plugins compiled for PE/COFF+Win32+x86.  In this case, you need a Win32 version of Mono under Wine.  If the CPU architecture is also, different that would need emulating; so Mono under Wine under Qemu).\n\nA: The short answer: \n.NET is Microsoft's answer to Java, and Mono is an open source implementation of it. Wine is for native exes and has nothing to do with Mono except that you can maybe run the .NET runtime with it, like any other native Windows software.\n\nThe long answer:\nTo understand the difference between Wine and Mono(and .NET) you must understand the difference between native machine code executables and \"common language runtime\" aka \"virtual machine\" executables:\nNative machine code executables use instruction codes specific to your processor and are directly executed by it. That means they have to be recompiled for different processors. Wine is able to run native machine code executables for Windows by directly running this executable code and catching any library calls it makes, redirecting them to it's own implementation of the Win32 API.\n\"CLR\" or \"VM\" executables are not specific to one processor: They need an extra piece of software to enable the processor to run them. Mono/.NET is one such example of this kind of system. .NET programs need the .NET runtime installed even when you run them on Windows. Java works the same way.\nSo: \n1) the difference between Wine and Mono: Wine is for running native machine code executables made for Windows, and Mono is for running Mono/.NET executables which are not necessarily made for any specific platform. Installing Mono on Linux is equivalent to installing the .NET runtime on Windows.\n2) If the program you want to run does not use .NET at all, you must use Wine. Mono won't help you at all here.\nHowever, if the program does use .NET you have two options, either of which may or may not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try to run it using Mono. This will fail if the .NET program also uses native functions from the win32 API, which many (but not all) .NET applications made for Windows do.\n\n*Alternatively, you can install the Microsoft .NET runtime for windows inside Wine, and then run the .NET application through it. You won't be using Mono at all in this case.\n3) Wine and Mono do not depend on each other at all, but as stated above, you can use the Microsoft .NET runtime in Wine to run Mono/.NET applications.\n", "Q: Additional keyrings for APT in trusted.gpg.d I'm creating a package that will automatically install some repositories to all hosts in the LAN. The package will be accessible from the central repository.\nI've discovered that repo lists can be dropped in '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list'. Now I need to import their keys, for instance, this one. However, when I drop it into '/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/Opera.gpg', apt-get update gives me a plenty of NO_PUBKEY errors for all repos I have, including Opera!\nWhat's wrong? :)\n\nA: Keys downloaded from repositories should be joint into a new GPG keyring so you can drop them into '/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/*.gpg', like this:\ngpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./Opera.gpg --import Opera.key\nsudo cp Opera.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/Opera.gpg\n\n\nA: Additionally, you could use apt-key to add the key for you in instead of manually dropping a file to that path. Assuming you saved the file as Opera.key:\nsudo apt-key add Opera.key\n\nYou could even download and import the key file on-the-fly, instead of saving it to a local file:\nwget -q -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\n\nApt-key manages the contents of /etc/apt/trusted.gpg main file instead of using the directory, which may be a convenience or a burden for you.\n\nA: You can actually get the best of both worlds: create an additional keyring in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ and use apt-key instead of gpg directly.\nIf you already have a keyfile locally, such as Opera.key, then run the following command:\nsudo apt-key --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/Opera.gpg add Opera.key\n\nOf course, you can still import the key directly as MestreLion demonstrated:\nwget -q -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/Opera.gpg add -\n\n", "Q: Dual booting on separate hard drives I have windows XP professional installed on 1 hard drive and Ubuntu 10.10 on my second hard drive.\nOn start up the computer completely skips the grub menu and boots straight into 10.10.\nI have tried running os-prober with the windows hard drive mounted and then updating grub but it didnt work.\nAny ideas?\nI have changed the boot order so that the HDD with xp on it is first however the computer still booted into linux.\nI tried running grub-install /dev/sda and got this  \n/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: Sector 32 is already in use by FlexNet; avoiding it.

That means the hard drive that is set as 1st boot device in BIOS.\nYou BIOS is probably set up to boot your \"2nd\" hand drive, where Ubuntu might be the boot partition, thus completely skipping grub.\nSo, my hints are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your BIOS. Usually this means pressing DEL or F2, or some other key during boot. The right key depends on which computer / brand / model you have. Usually when the PC starts, there is text like \"Press XXX for BIOS settings\"\n\n*At BIOS setup screen, try to find your boot options. WHERE they are located also depends on your computer / brand / model. Make sure you choose your 1st hard drive as your 1st boot device. Save settings and quit.\n\n*Now, install grub in THAT hard drive (usually /dev/sda). Like this:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\n*If you cant boot ubuntu after switching the hard drive boot order, change back to previous settings (so you can boot Ubuntu back). Now your 1st hard drive (the one that has XP partition) might be /dev/sbd. Just use the above command replacing sda for sdb. Now go back to BIOS and change boot order again\nIf you need, i can give you more detailed instructions. Give me your computer (or motherboard) brand and model so i can guide you for BIOS keys and menus. Also, please post the contents of:\ngedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo blkid\n\nHope that helps!\nUPDATE:\nFrom all the files you posted, I have 2 theories:\n1 - grub-install warning suggests me that is actully NOT being installed. Read HERE for a great explanation about FlexNet and Grub. FlexNet looks like a licence manager, anty-piracy protection that writes data in the very MBR space grub uses for its multi-booting code. So you probably have some FlexNet-dependent software in your XP, and Grub refuses to overwrite it, thus refusing to install itself. The same link has info on how to fix that.\nWithout grub installed on MBR, your HD is booting the traditional way: the partition flagged as bootable in your 1st HD. That means Ubuntu (check fdisk's /dev/sda1 marked as boot partition)\n2 - Also, your grub.cfg dow NOT show windows XP, as if os-prober didnt find it. (take a look at your ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ### section. It should be something like this (just an example):\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nmenuentry \"Microsoft Windows XP Professional (on /dev/sdb1)\" {\n    savedefault\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='(hd1,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 485083315dc8e22a\n    drivemap -s (hd1) ${root}\n    chainloader +1\n}\n### END /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\n\nInstead, yours have no menuentry. Somehow grub did not \"find\" your XP parition when scanned your drives, or didnt think it was a valid OS. \nThus, as grub menu would have no OS other than Ubuntu, it automatically skips the menu and boots straight into your 1st (and only, acoording to him) OS. You could force grub to show the menu by holding SHIFT key right after the POST. But, again, it would only have Ubuntu (and memtest, and previous kernel, and recovery mode), but not XP.\n\nSo, either grub is not installed (it resuses to do so when it finds FlexNet and silently aborts), or it is installed, but since it has only Ubuntu, it bypasses the menu. Or both. Any would make Ubuntu to boot.\nNow lets check and fix both theories:\n1\n\n\n*\n\n*Is grub actually installed on /dev/sda? Keep SHIFT pressed on boot, and menu will show up instead of being bypassed. If it doesnt show up, grub is not actually installed. Do so by removing FlexNet code from MBR (the same link above have instructions on how) . Then install grub and check if there is no warning.\n\n*Remember that wiping FlexNet from MBR will make its dependent software fail to work\n2\nIs your XP install a valid one? Can it boot without grub, in a single-OS enviroment? Somehow grub's OS Prober didnt think so. Lets test it then:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu, use gParted to mark its partition as BOOT (right-click partition -> Flags -> check BOOT)\n\n*Also, try to mount your XP partiton (double-click on it in Nautilus) and check if its OK. Take a look at its boot.ini file. Should be something like:\n[boot loader]\ntimeout=30\ndefault=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS\n[operating systems]\nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS=\"Microsoft Windows XP Professional\" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /usepmtimer\n\n*Disconnect the Ubuntu HD. Leave only the XP one. Set BIOS to boot it. Try to see if XP works (it prolly wont yet, but who knows?)\n\n*Using any Windows bootable CD / USB / Floppy, use windows (NOT linux!) fdisk /mbr to wipe grub of it. Do not fear, grub is only needed in /dev/sda, your 1st hard drive, and since this will be back to /dev/sdb when this is over, grub is not needed on that HD.\n\n*Try now. It should work. Nope? Then use a XP boot CD to repair that install. If that is your only connected HD and XP is the sole OS, partition marked as boot, with a cleaned-up MBR and repaired install, it must boot, or else later grub wont be able to help you much...\nIt works? Cool! Connect the other (Ubuntu) HD back, set it up as before (as boot HD in BIOS), launch Ubuntu and run grub-install /dev/sda again. OS prober should detect XP now, and with 2 OSes in its list, menu will show up at boot.\nWow, that was a long answer. You have quite a lot of homework to do . I hope it all works. Good luck!\n\nA: sdb1: ______________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows XP\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  Windows XP\n    Boot files/dirs:   \n\nThe above section is from your boot info script output. For a working Windows XP installation that last line should be\n    Boot files/dirs:   /boot.ini /ntldr /NTDETECT.COM\n\nYour Windows partition does not appear to have files necessary for Windows to boot. This is why os-prober is not detecting any Windows install, and it also means that there is nothing that can be done from GRUB to make Windows boot.\nWithout knowing more about why those files are missing I can't help much with fixing the problem. Do you have any idea why they are missing?\n\nA: Boot from second Hard Disk (or whichever disk you have GRUB)\nI had it like that for my guest PC. When I turn it on, it went to XP straight away like any single Partition PC.\nWhen I wanted Ubuntu, i would go to the boot selection while POST, and select my second hard drive and GRUB was loaded.\nSo it really depends on how you got things set up in account for your MBR and such.\n", "Q: Ubuntu one stuck in rescan trying to sync about 80 gigs of data.

Maybe you can use them as a starting point.\nNote: My notebook has a nvidia graphic card, so i have to use disper instead of xrandr.\nScript to switch to the external monitor and set gnome-panel to monitor 1:\n#!/bin/sh\ndisper --displays=auto -e\nlines=`disper -l|wc -l`\n\ndisplay_count=$((lines / 2))\n\nif [ $display_count = 1 ] ; then\n\n   gconftool-2 \\\n        --set \"/apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel_screen0/monitor\" \\\n        --type integer \"0\"\n   disper -s\nelse\n   gconftool-2 \\\n        --set \"/apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel_screen0/monitor\" \\\n        --type integer \"1\"\n   disper -S\n\nfi\n\nSecond script to switch back to Notebook-monitor:\n#!/bin/sh\n disper -s  \n gconftool-2 \\\n        --set \"/apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel_screen0/monitor\" \\\n        --type integer \"0\"\n\n\nA: Someone may wish to embellish this answer but I hope its useful as a starting point and might involve a bit of learning.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your panel settings are stored somewhere in your GNOME settings in your /home/user/ directory. Probably .gconf/ or .gnome2/, you can see these directories by opening a terminal and typing ls -a or just by pressing ctrl+h in nautilus while in your home directory. Hopefully if you root around in there and on the internet you should be able to find them in a file.\n\n*Once you know while file it is make a copy of it with the single monitor set up, then plug in your external monitor and set everything up again and make a copy of it again.\n\n*Finally you could write a script which would run straight after login and check to see if there is an external display plugged in (or just look at how many displays there are), and then copy the relevant configuration file into place just before GNOME starts up and hopefully everything should look as it should.\nUnfortunately I don't know exactly where the relevant configuration settings are or how to check for external displays in a script and some of that will depend on what scripting language you're used to (if you're not used to any I'd suggest just a bash script for this, or maybe python).

I have a dualboot Ubuntu and Windows XP on my PC.\nDoes Ubuntu require drivers for the onboard Ethernet card? If not, how can I make an Internet conection using an ADSL modem?\n\nA: For network connections we have Network Manager installed as the default tool to connect to networks, and to setup connections. There is also a section to setup a DSL/ADSL connection. Additional drivers for your LAN card are most likely not needed.\nTo open network manager setting right click on the panel symbol and choose Edit Connections:\n\nIn the window that opens choose the DSL Tab and Add a new connection:\n\nEnter the data your ISP needs to connect in the following window:\n\nIf you haven't installed Ubuntu yet best advice is you try out Ubuntu booting from a live CD.

The command is \nsudo pon dsl-provider \n\n(but I think you can define arbitrary dsl connection names (\"dsl-provider\" is just a generic default).  \nBefore that you have to call \"pppoeconf\" to set up the provider metadata (username, password, host to connect to etc). \"pppoeconf\" means point-to-point-protocol-over-ethernet configuration, I think.\nHaven't done this in a long time.

As you can see in the changelog for the Linux kernel, there are update messages like \"Bump ABI - Maverick ABI 28\".\nAccording to the Ubuntu Wiki, ABI is something like a bridge between the kernel space and the other modules (my interpretation).\nDoes such an update adds extra features and / or bugfixes? Should I upgrade my kernel to the next version?\n\nA: The ABI is the Application Binary Interface, (not to be confused with the API, the Application Programming Interface). The ABI defines the sizes, the signs and the orders of the numbers that the application is using.\nTo be clear, here is an example: I want to encode the age of a building, expressed in years. To do so, I can use a C unsigned char, which is a type which size is 1 byte, and that can encode values from 0 to 255. Now suppose that I discover that 255 is a too low limit because there are buildings which were built more than 255 years ago. I can then use a C unsigned int, which is 4-bytes long and can encode values from 0 to 65535.\nChanging the type from char to int, I haven't changed the semantic meaning of the field (it was an age expressed in years and it still is), however I have changed its size. Every software that interacts with my application won't need to be changed, however it will speak a different \"language\".\nTherefore, when a kernel changes its ABI, it means that it has changed the language it speaks, but no functionalities have been added, removed or modified. All third party modules that have to interact with the kernel need to be recompiled in order to speak this new language, but they do not need to be changed in any way in order to work correctly.\n\nA: First off, you are not looking at the changelog for the linux kernel.  You are looking at the meta package, which is a package that depends on the latest kernel.  You probably want something like: http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux-image-2.6.35-28-generic/linux-image-2.6.35-28-generic_2.6.35-28.50/changelog \nThe purpose of this meta-package is to transition the user through these ABI bumps.\nI hold the same view as you on the ABI and the kernel.  Practically speaking, an ABI bump means that all the modules need to be rebuilt against the updated kernel.  \nMy understanding is also in line with Roland, in that an ABI bump does not mean new features, just critical fixes and security updates.  \n\nA: NB: I'm no kernel expert - so this is based on collected knowledge and experience.\nAn ABI \"bump\" should not bring new features, even though it may \"fix\" bugs in some modules/applications that are looking for a higher version of the ABI. You should still install these updates, since generally keeping all components in sync will ensure stability and security.\n", "Q: One year of Ubuntu experience, still not an expert?

Can some one give me an example scenario where this package can be used?\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/simpleproxy\n\nA: The manual page is very descriptive:\n\nThe  simpleproxy program acts as a simple tcp proxy. It opens listening socket on local machine and forwards any connection to the remote host.\n\nFrom this text, and its option, I can imagine some use cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*HTTP proxy\n\n*Connection to a machine in the network which can otherwise not be reached from outside because of a firewall (IPtables can do this too, but requires root)\n\n\nA: I realize this question was posted many years ago, but it still appears at the top of Google results, so I think it'd be helpful to add here.  Yes, the manual page is very descriptive, but it doesn't show any examples.  The command line usage is a little better (the manpage seems to imply that the -S switch is required, when it's not).\nBasic usage:\nsimpleproxy -L [local port on which you want to listen for remote requests] -R [remote host:remote port for which you want to proxy/tunnel to]\n\nA simple example:\nsimpleproxy -L 80 -R some.service.com:9999\n\nRunning in detached/headless mode (add the -d switch, and you'd probably want to set it up as a startup service if you need the proxy to be persistent):\nsimpleproxy -d -L 80 -R some.service.com:9999\n\nYou can check that it's listening:\nlsof -i \n\nYou should see a line like:\nsimplepro 26317  root    3u  IPv4 86748140      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\n\nKeep in mind, traffic in between the connecting machine and the simpleproxy server could probably be sniffed.  If you're connecting to an HTTPS service at the other end, I would advise using stunnel instead.  Or you can try adding the -S switch, but I haven't personally used it.\n", "Q: Firefox 4.0 Theming I am dual booting Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat and Windows 7 on my Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop.

Is there a way to reset kubuntu to the initial state?\nUnder initial state, I mean the system and all settings are as kubuntu was installed on a clean disk, but to preserve installed packages.\nIf possible I would like to avoid making data backup and reinstalling kubuntu.\n\nA: If the idea is to return KDE to the default state, if you rename your ~/.kde folder (hidden) to something like kde-bak, then when you log back in you'll see the desktop as it was when you first installed.  That will do away with some configurations that you might miss though, like for your kmail e-mail account (including e-mails), but in that case you can copy the ~/.kde/share/apps/kmail back from the renamed (kde-bak) folder.  You won't be able to rename the .kde directory while it's in use, because it will re-create itself, so the best way to do it is from the Recovery Mode or from a Live CD environment.\n", "Q: Docky \"Enable Compositing\" error and black bar visualized instead of it I get this black bar across the bottom of my screen when ever I boot up, tried reboot and no joy, keep getting messages from docky telling me to \"enable composting\".

From there you can try to enable \"Normal\" or \"Extra\" desktop effects in the \"Visual Effects\" tab.\nIf Compiz won't play nice with your graphics card, you can enable Metacity's compositing, which will at least allow Docky to run normally. To do this, press Alt+F2, then run gconf-editor. On the left side, browse to apps > metacity > general, then check the box next to \"compositing_manager\" on the right.\n", "Q: Can't get \"gem\" command to work - Why? Ubuntu 10.10 here. On the command line, I'm trying to do:\ngem install railsless-deploy\n\nI get this message:\n\nThe program 'gem' can be found in the\n  following packages:  * rubygems1.8  *\n  rubygems1.9.1 Try: sudo apt-get\n  install \n\nSo I did: sudo apt-get install rubygems1.9.1\nI then try the command again: gem install railsless-deploy\nBut the same quoted message appears again.

It (or NetworkManager or my wireless driver) seem to crash occasionally, which means I lose all network connectivity. How can I debug NetworkManager and the applet on startup and login? I want to know what is causing the problem so that I can fix it or file a bug report.\nEdit: This page provides some good details about debugging the NetworkManager daemon, but I'm still having trouble with the applet (e.g. the applet crashes, I lose my connection, I restart NetworkManager and use commandline utilities, regain my connection, but no applet comes back). \n\nA: Network-Manager is started from /etc/init.d, as a short look reveals: \nls /etc/init.d/netw*\n  /etc/init.d/networking\n  /etc/init.d/network-interface\n  /etc/init.d/network-manager\n\nSo you first can stop it: \nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop\n\nI don't know how you like to debug it, with strace? \n\nfrom man NetworkManager\n       --no-daemon\n              Do  not  daemonize.   This  is useful for debugging, and directs log output to the controlling\n              terminal in addition to syslog.\n\nDEBUGGING\n       The following environment variables are supported to help debugging.  When used in  conjunction  with\n       the  \"--no-daemon\"  option (thus echoing PPP and DHCP helper output to stdout) these can quickly help\n       pinpoint the source of connection issues.\n\nSo instead of strace and a simple restart, you should perhaps first stop the daemon, and then start with the above option in a console, so you can view live what's going on.\n\nA: search the logfiles: \ndmesg | tail \n\nshortly after an incident, maybe with tail -n 40, see man tail\ngrep -i net /var/log/*log\n\nif you find something interesting: \nless /var/log/XY.log\n\nIf you know your wlan module name, grep for that. \n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu One Save Purchased Music in the designated Music Folder? I like all of my music to be in one place - my music partition. However, when I purchase music from Ubuntu One I have to physically move my music from the ~/.ubuntuone folder and into my music partition.\nIs it because of the feature of syncing purchased music to all devices that there is a separate folder? It's a great feature, no doubt, but I still find myself navigating to that folder to move things myself.\n\nA: There's another point not covered by @popey's answer: while there will be a number of people upset by the music not appearing in with the rest of the music, there also will be a number of people upset because the new music is appearing mixed in with their music collection before they have a chance to curate it appropriately. The first group can simply move the files over, whereas the second group would have to hunt down the new music first.\nMeanwhile, the rest of us are just listening to the music and not caring where it's coming from.\n\nA: I asked this very same question of the developer of the Ubuntu One Music Store Rhthmbox Plugin when it was under development. His response was that the music is in a separate folder because if you synced your entire ~/Music collection you'd (probably) quickly run out of space in your 2GB free space. So only your purchased music is (by default) sync'ed. \nBack then you couldn't actually sync random folders as easily as you can now, so it made sense to keep your purchased music separate from your massive Music folder.\nHe also countered my \"I want to see the files\" point with \"why?\". Rhythmbox is quite capable of showing you your music files, can play them, and even load them onto your music player. What's the advantage to being able to see the files in a file manager?\nI personally see his points. By way of a comparison, on my wifes OSX Mac there is Music in iTunes and I have no idea where it is on the filesystem, and frankly I don't care :) It gets backed up, and in iTunes I can drag it to a player device if I want to. \nGuess the same is true of Rhythmbox. I have learned not to care :) \n", "Q: php server web user setup I'm needing to setup a basic web user account on my ubuntu 10.10 server to host web pages. This account should be limited to access only the necessary directories on the machine. I setup the following account but nothing happens when I try to log into it:\n:~$ groupadd -g 1005 webgroup\n//I then changed the group and permissions of a current user I had already created\n:~$ sudo usermod -g 1005 -s /bin/false -d /home/webuser/ webuser\n\nWhen trying to login using this account I enter the username [webuser] and the password but it just redirects me back to the login: prompt. I tried resetting the password but still have the same problem.\nCan someone either tell me what I'm doing wrong, or suggest another method that would achieve the same result (if not a better one).\nIt sounds like I do not want the user to be able to login at all.  However, (my grasp on this concept is apparently very small so bear with me) doesn't the user have to be logged in for web requests to be received by that user? In other words, web requests are received and interpreted by the user who is logged in at that time (correct?).  If this is a continuously running server and is always turned on in our server room, then shouldn't the logged in user be my 'webuser' I just created in order to limit access to individuals trying to hack in?\n\nA: You don't need to have anyone \"log in\" to the server for the webserver to run. The web server (Apache?) Will run as either nobody, apache, http, or whatever user that service is designed to run as. It'll serve up content to whatever valid requests are made to it as long as it's on. Since it runs daemonized it will continue to run without anyone logged in actively. Furthermore, no one should have to log in as the webserver user for security reasons.\nIf you want users to be able to upload and place new content on the webserver without actually giving them access to the machine they don't need SSH access (though you could give them that) They really need FTP access to a secured location on the box which the web server is configured to read from. Typically most web servers read from /var/www - though you can configure it to read from any directory in the system. They don't constantly need to be logged in for it to run either. Just log in via FTP - upload files - refresh browser.\n\nA: You are using /bin/false, which connects then closes your connection. Perhaps setting the user's shell to /bin/bash will remedy this issue.\n:~$ chsh -s /bin/bash webuser\n\nWhen I checked /etc/shells, I saw no /bin/false listed.\n\nA: What exactly are you trying to achieve? The question states that you'd like to allow access to selected directories only, but your comment to tenach's answer suggests that you want to disallow login at all.\nThe best way to enclose a user in a specific directory hierarchy is to chroot SSH sessions, and there are tutorials on how to do that on the Web. I don't recommend relying solely on Unix permissions for protection.\n", "Q: Can I rate an application in software center without writing a review for it? Can I just rate an application in the Ubuntu Software Center without having to write a complete review?\nI only get a window with SSO and a review text and rating.\n\nA: According to this section of the specification it appears to be on purpose, probably to discourage people from voting without giving a reason why:\n\nThe review service should reject with an error any review that does not have all of review text, summary, and a rating.\n\n", "Q: How do I install Capistrano?

I know it is in the repositories for 10.10, but it quite outdated. I like Unity and Gnome Shell, and have spent time using both, but I just went back to 10.10 from 11.04 as Unity and compiz keep crashing on alpha 3. I was just wondering if the Shell would be in the 11.04 repositories for release?\n\nA: No, it will not.

Only when I'm logged onto the virtual machine's ubuntu, can I access it remotely. Is there a way around this? \nIs this the ubuntu vm's configuration, or the virtual box's, or...?\nThank you so much!\n\nA: If you set the network connection to \"bridged\", restart the VM and run ifconfig -a on it, you should see the IP address of your VM on your LAN.  \nWith the LAN IP, you should then be able to SSH to the VM given that the Ubuntu VM has OpenSSHServer installed.  \nI am not sure if this is possible without bridged network connection though, but this works for me.

This fixed a whole lot of stuff, so I then rebooted. \nAll's well and the boot goes fine, except instead of my automatic login to desktop, I'm at the default login screen. I can see my normal username, except my password now doesn't work (showing in a split second Authentication Failed or something similar then returning to the user list). Clicking Automatic Login on the menu just flashes nothing and returns to the user list. \nTrying to login through tty doesn't work either.\nDoes anyone know how I could fix this and login as my normal user again?\n\nA: OP answered:\n\nI think I may have found the problem, seems /etc/shadow was renamed to /etc/shadow- for some reason. Fixing that I could run passwd with chroot from the LiveCD and change my password. I'll see if it helps on reboot. \n\n\nA: Well I'm glad you fixed it but it wasn't renamed. /etc/shadow- is a backup of /etc/shadow.\n/etc/shadow is a fairly critical file on any system so it does make sense to keep a copy around. In this case it looks as if it was deleted or irreparably damaged by something. It may have been a malicious attack to try and cripple your system or it may have just been a hiccough in the system.\nBut you did the right thing. I'd perhaps consider running a virus scan and fsck the disk to check it's all fine. \n", "Q: How do I completely format my disk? I want to format because my laptop has stopped connecting to my wireless connection and hopefully this will fix it.\n\nA: Take a look at this: How to clean a hard drive before reinstall\nPlaced here for your convenience:\n\nIf you refer to a fresh reinstall,\n  when reinstalling you will find\n  several options for the usage of your\n  hard disk drive, which includes but\n  not limits to: \n\"Side by Side\" install, which will\n  install your new OS sharing the hard\n  disk drive but without losing your\n  current installation. This way, GRUB\n  will be updated or installed as\n  required.\n\"Use the entire disk\" which will\n  physically erase the whole disk in\n  order to use all its space for the new\n  OS install.\nIf what you wish is to use the hard\n  disk drive for a data tasks such as\n  BackUp or other data handling, you can\n  achieve that by first erasing the\n  whole partition and do it from\n  scratch. Formatting the disk will also\n  do the trick. \nSeveral tools will help you to achieve\n  this task in Linux and other OS's.\nIn Maverick, under\n  \"system/administration\" you will find\n  a \"Disk Utility\", inside of which you\n  will find a disk drive and other\n  devices tree on the left and its\n  characteristics and tool list in the\n  right side, where you can find both\n  \"Delete Partition\" and \"Format Drive\"\n  options.\nYou can do this from a Live Session.\nA screenshot is placed here for your convenience.\n\n\nAddittionally, take in consideration that some wireless devices has stopped working as a part of an update from Maverick. That's my case with a Compaq Presario V3000 (V3617LA) which wireless isn't working anymore even with all my efforts and all the web/forums tricks.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Completely reformatting your disk is relatively easy in Ubuntu.

My machine no longer resumes properly after hibernation. However, it used to until recently.\nWhen trying to figure this out, I've seen lots of people say that hibernate doesn't work with encrypted home directories. But that can't be right - I've had en encrypted directory since it was default, and my machine used to resume. And doesn't everyone have an encrypted directory by default now - surely hibernate would never work then!\n\nA: Out of the box hibernation does not work with the encrypted swap Ubuntu sets up together with encrypted home directories. Disabling swap encryption is not a good idea as the encryption keys are written to the swap in plain text when the system hibernates, and also in other cases it is possible that the keys are leaked to swap space, effectively rendering the whole concept useless. Again: Do not disable swap encryption, especially if you plan to hibernate the system.\nBut it is not too hard to set a static passphrase instead of the random one. This way you have to enter the swap encryption passphrase every time you boot (or resume from hibernation). Unattended boots are not possible this way, but for many scenarios this is not a problem.\nI tested the following instructions on Ubuntu 12.04 and it worked very well:\nEnable Hibernate With Encrypted Swap\n\nA: No, hibernate is definitely broken if you encrypt home.  Actually the problem isn't encrypted home per se, it's the encrypted swap that's the problem.\nHere's the bug for this issue if you want to track it or comment:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/432785\nAlternately, you can disable encrypted swap, but as the manpage for ecrypt-setup-swap says:\n\nEncrypted swap is essential to  securing  any  system  using  eCryptfs,\n         since  decrypted file contents will exist in the system’s memory, which\n         may be swapped to disk at any time.  If the system swap  space  is  not\n         also encrypted, it is possible that decrypted files could be written to\n         disk in clear text.\n\nIf you understand the risks and still feel comfortable disabling swap encryption, I found a good and very to the point HOWTO here:\nhttp://www.logilab.org/blogentry/29155\n", "Q: How do I put a web application on the Launcher? Sometimes I see pictures of screenshots with people with web applications and nice icons on their launcher, how can I set this up?\n\nA: Currently there are two preferred ways to do this. In Ubuntu 12.04 you can use the the preview of the official Ubuntu Webapps by installing it from a PPA (comes by default with 12.10)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webapps/preview\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unity-webapps-preview\n\nThis only works for supported websites (currently about 40). When you visit the site with Firefox you will be asked if you want to integrate it into Ubuntu.\nThe other way is to use Fogger, the silver-prize winner of the Ubuntu App Showdown. Just install the fogger package from software-center.\nBoth options are better than the regular site-specific-browsing (ssb) features of Firefox Prism and Chrome, because they allow full integration with Ubuntu. This includes the launcher-menu, the HUD, indicators and notifications.\n\nA: Ubuntu has this feature built in, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use Ubuntu's web application integration?\nYou can also use the more traditional webapp integration approach:\nSince these can be time consuming if you use a bunch of webapps I created a \"Web Applications\" folder that I keep these in because I need a place to hold the icon as well. I sync this folder with Ubuntu One so that on reinstalls or new computers I have my applications all ready to go with the high resolution icons. \nIn chromium-browser  or Google Chrome you can do this by going to the website you want to make into an application. Clicking on the Wrench icon and select, tools -> Create Application Shortcuts:\n\nThen select Desktop to create a shortcut on your desktop:\n\nYou can also select \"Applications Menu\" in the create application shortcut, this will put it in the Dash for you, which is handy so you can use the search feature to launch the shortcut, however most web site's favicons don't scale very well so they look ugly. So instead I do this to pretty up the application:\nThen move it to this \"Web Applications\" folder or wherever you want to keep it:\n\nDownload a snazzy version of the icon that is good looking. I recommend the Fluid group on Flickr. Download the icon to the folder, and then right click on the shortcut and select properties:\n\nDrag and drop the nicer icon onto the shortcut's icon box, replacing the low resolution icon with the new one:\n\nDrag and drop the new slick icon right onto the Launcher for the final effect:\n\nAnd the final effect:\n\n\nA: Progressive Web Apps (PWA)\nIf you have a PWA is much easier. One way I found here is for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install PWAify: npm install -g pwaify\n\n*Generate binaries with electron: pwaify https://voice-memos.appspot.com/ --platforms=linux, or whatever your PWA URL is.\n\n*Go to subfolder and run the app.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: If you use the latest build of Chromium (>11.0.696.57) this now works with Unity. Create the app shorcut from within Chromium then drag it on to the Unity bar. This works on 11.04\n\nA: I think it is good practice to make a different Chromium profile for every app. Your apps will run faster because the extensions installed in the default profile are not run. Also, you can install extensions specific for your app that won't run in your default chromium instances.\nIf you want to run your apps with a different profile, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new profile directory: \nmkdir ~/.config/NAME_OF_APP\n\n\n*Right-click on the shortcut to your app on your desktop\n\n*Add \n--user-data-dir=~/.config/NAME_OF_APP\n\nto the command and close.\n\nIf this doesn't work, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new profile directory:\nmkdir ~/.config/NAME_OF_APP\n\n\n*Right-click on the shortcut to your app on your desktop\n\n*Add\n--user-data-dir=--user-data-dir=~/.config/NAME_OF_APP\n\nto the command and close.\n\nA: I agree with @con-f-use that a .desktop file is the way to go, but I would suggest using webapp-container, which is designed for this purpose, rather than Firefox. Here's my example, drawn from an Ubuntu SDK Web App project:\n[Desktop Entry]\nComment[en_US]=webapp for WorkFlowy\nComment=webapp for WorkFlowy\nExec=webapp-container --store-session-cookies --webappUrlPatterns=https?://workflowy.com/* http://workflowy.com %u\nGenericName[en_US]=\nGenericName=\nIcon=/home/CORP.INSTRUCTURE.COM/banderson/Pictures/WorkFlowy.png\nMimeType=\nName=WorkFlowy\nPath=\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\nTerminalOptions=\nType=Application\nX-DBUS-ServiceName=\nX-DBUS-StartupType=\nX-KDE-SubstituteUID=false\nX-KDE-Username=\nX-Ubuntu-Touch=true\n\nTo create the shortcut, just create an executable file in your desktop folder named something like WorkFlowy.desktop and paste in these contents.\n\nA: You create a launcher icon (meaning a .desktop file) that says Exec=firefox www.askubuntu.com and drag it to the launcher. So first create an empty file and paste the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Ask Ubuntu\nComment=Open Ask Ubuntu in firefox\nExec=firefox www.askubuntu.com\nIcon=network\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GNOME;\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\nX-GNOME-Keywords=Network;AskUbuntu;\nName[en_US]=AskUbuntu\n\nThen rename the epmty file to somename.desktop in this case \"askubuntu.desktop\" would be an appropriate name. Now use the mouse to grag it to your launcher and you're good.\nThis is not necessary but before dragging it to the launcher, you can right-click on it, go to Properties->Permissions->Allow executing file as program so as the icon of the launcher to became visible!\nIf you delete the *.desktop file the icon will disappear form you launcher. The usual place to store these files is ~/.local/share/applications/.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 22.04, you can do this using \"Gnome Web\", also called \"Epiphany Browser\".\n\n*\n\n*Install Gnome Web:\nsudo apt install epiphany-browser\n\n\n\n*Open Gnome Web using the launcher\n\n\n\n*Open the website you want to turn into an app.\n\n\n*Open the settings menu and choose \"Install Site as Web Application...\"\n\n\n\n*Choose a name and click \"create\".\n\nNow you can open this website as an app:\n\nAny external links you click on in the webapp will be opened in your default browser.\n", "Q: How to run mysql commands through shell script? mysql -u root -pmysql;\n\nSELECT TABLE_NAME AS \"Table Name\", table_rows AS \"Quant of Rows\", ROUND((data_length + index_length)/1024/1024,2) AS \"Total Size Mb\"  FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE information_schema.TABLES.table_schema='database_name';\n\nI want to create a shell script which will execute these command and return the result.\nHow may i run this commands through shell script ?\n\nA: mysql -u root -pmysql << eof\nSELECT TABLE_NAME AS \"Table Name\", table_rows AS \"Quant of Rows\", ROUND((data_length + index_length)/1024/1024,2) AS \"Total Size Mb\"  FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE information_schema.TABLES.table_schema='database_name';\neof\n\n", "Q: Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! i'm trying to perform the load command on a clean machine- the process sterted and stuck on this line : Kernel panic- not syncing: Attempted to kill init!\nwhat can be the reason?\n\nA: Are you trying to do a clean install of Ubuntu from CD onto a physical PC?

I'm a relative newbie to Ubuntu (10.04). I'm converting from Windows to Ubuntu, and the last piece of the puzzle is installing a substitute for Microsoft Money; e.g. KmyMoney. I have installed KMyMoney 1.0.4 using KDE 3.5.10 from the repositories but there is a more recent version available from the KMyMoney website (4.5.3 for Platform KDE4). From SPM, it looks like I have installed KDE libs 4c2a (which I assume is KDE4)\nI've tried \"Software Sources/other sources\" and added a PPA site but it didn't work. What is the correct specific procedure for downloading this other software? And on a related question, what is the difference between the KDE desktop and the standard gnome desktop, and, if I install KDE4, how do I select one or the other at boot? Can I run KMyMoney in gnome (do I need KDE)?  Thanks\n\nA: \nhow do I update to the most recent version of KMyMoney?\n\nUpdate to the latest version of Ubuntu\nWhen using an older version of Ubuntu, such as 10.04, the easiest way to get the latest software is to upgrade to the latest Ubuntu (currently 11.04).  Updating Ubuntu will also  update all of the software you have installed (if updates are available).\nThe version of Ubuntu that you're using is a Long Term Support release, so by default, you won't be prompted to upgrade. If you want to upgrade Ubuntu, go to System > Administration > Software Sources. Then, under the \"Updates\" tab, set \"Release upgrade\" to \"Normal Releases\", then run Update Manager and check for updates.\n\nI have installed KMyMoney 1.0.4... but there is a more recent version available from the KMyMoney website (4.5.3)\n\nThe change in version number may look significant, but KMyMoney actually just updated its version number to match the rest of the KDE platform.  Unless you know of specific features in the new version that you don't have in 1.0.4, I wouldn't bother with the update.\nAdd a PPA\nIf, for whatever reason, you'd prefer to stick with the Ubuntu 10.04, but you really want the newest version of KMyMoney, you'll want to add a PPA.  When you add a PPA, application updates will be installed through Ubuntu's Update Manager.  Keep in mind that these updates are coming from a third-party, and you should only add PPAs from trusted sources.\nI'm not sure why the PPA didn't work for you before, but in theory, this would be the way to go.  This is the PPA you want: ppa:claydoh/kmymoney2-kde4 See here for more information on how to add PPAs to Ubuntu 10.04.\nBonus Questions\n\nwhat is the difference between the KDE desktop and the standard gnome desktop\n\nKDE and Gnome are the two most popular desktop environments for Linux.  Generally, the desktop environment controls the look and feel of the user interface and the default applications (web browser, text editors, email client, etc).  You can find a lot about the specific differences on Wikipedia.\n\nif I install KDE4, how do I select one or the other at boot?\n\nOn the login screen you'll be able to choose which session (Gnome or KDE) you want to use.\n\nCan I run KMyMoney in gnome (do I need KDE)?\n\nYou can run KMyMoney in Gnome (this is what I do), but if I remember correctly, it depends on a lot of KDE libraries and tools, so it will install a lot of extra stuff.  This shouldn't be a problem unless you're really low on hard drive space.\nAnyway, welcome to Ubuntu, and sorry it took awhile for your question to get answered.  If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n", "Q: Attenuate applications while receiving output from Mumble This relates to Mumble. The attenuate  other applications feature does not work (lowers volume of other applications while someone is talking).\nI was wondering if there was native feature built into Ubuntu which can take over this duty.\nSuggestions much appreciated.\n\nA: This is something that has bothered me for quite some time, so I decided to go fix it. :) As of a few minutes ago, support for this has been merged into Mumble for the next release:\nhttps://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/0e4d963a5a762520945d01a328d17688fb6c2fd8\nYou can try it now if you're brave and want to run off of git, otherwise you'll need to wait for the next release.

If we want to run it manually ...\nThanks \n\nA: If you open a terminal and type ps axu | grep gvfsd you will see what instances of gvfsd are running.\nIt will show you where the process is running from and what arguments it was passed when started. It will also show you when it started and the user that started it.\n\nA: So this isn't complete answer but it may be a good starting point.\nDbus a shared bus used for communication between different programs, has the ability to lazily spawn processes to handle types of messages. It can therefore be used as a convenient way to handle long lived services for processes belonging to one user.\nThe definitions of how to automatically spawn services are set up in the dbus configuration /etc/dbus-1/session.conf, which on my machine seems to (implicitly) pull in /usr/share/dbus-1/services.\nThis basically means that any process, or a library it pulls in could be starting your service. As far as suggestions for how to work out who is doing the spawning there are two approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*The dbus-monitor can monitor all messages on the bus. Possible you could kill gvfsd and see who restarts it.\n\n*You may be able to convience the dbus daemon itself to do more monitoring.\n\n\nFor reference on my machine opening a terminal caused a new gvfsd to be started.

As a Laptop user, I'm sure that a lot of people, even the ones using Netbooks would have already gone through this problem. Especially when listening to podcasts, and using it as an example, the sound might have loud moments and quiet moments, one person speaking loud and the other speaking very quiet in the same episode. Thereby, I always wanted the sound to be compressed system-wide, and I just noted the other day, that in Windows, some Realtek drivers already offer this function.\nWe have already a pulseaudio plugin for equalization system-wide, and although it still has problems like not letting us change its values and listen the change in real time, or cracking the sound while changing pulse volume, I do love it and use it. Now I'm just missing something to keep the sound around 0db (or near the volume level you're using) as a leveler plugin for pulseaudio.\nAny suggestion?\n\nA: These have been extremely helpful. Thank you for the inspiration. Although it is imperfect at the moment, I have a bit to contribute back. I looked in  The Steve Harris Documentation to find that there are several flavors of the compressor, and I chose to use the stereo one. It did complicate using Pulse Audio Volume Control to place the compressor on multiple applications like Chrome and VLC, but I like the result. My motivation for using a compressor is to place a very strict lower and upper limit on volume. In order to not wake anyone in the house late at night, I didn't want to be constantly turning up the volume to hear the characters speaking in media, only to rush to turn it back down whenever superhero action happens or a commercial comes on. I followed the inspiration here and adjusted the values in realtime. Then I took my desired values and put them back into the sample code. In sum, the sample code I am contributing shamelessly borrows from the above example, but features the stereo compressor with a pretty strict  upper and lower volume limit. Lastly, I put it into the form of a script. I hope this is useful to the community.\n#!/bin/sh\n# ComperssorScript.sh\n# Script to start PulseAudio Compressor with desired settings\n# Original: 2016 September 17\n\npacmd load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=compressor plugin=sc4_1882 label=sc4 control=9,5,63,-6,15,3,49\npacmd set-default-sink compressor\n\n# The parameters (the control=1,1.5,401,-30,20,5,12 for example) for this compressor are described in Steve Harris' LADSPA Plugin Docs:\n# RMS/peak: The balance between the RMS and peak envelope followers.

Similar to the way of Windows Net Send.\n\nA: I read you wanted to do this without SSH, I believe I have a solution: netcat [nc]\nIt comes with Ubuntu by default.\nFirst we need a \"daemon\" to run in the background. Second, we need a program to make the alert pop up.  I have zenity installed.  If you do not, please install it, or edit the script to use whatever you like [e.x. xmessage, but that is ugly].

Thank you.\n\nA: It is a great question, and I was looking for something like that too, but I'm pretty sure there is nothing like that already built into Nautilus,  \nbut if you can turn your hand to some scripting, you could relatively easily adapt Nautilus file Notes to do something similar. It would require some basic(+?) scripting.. \nWith file Notes you can add Notes to a Directory as well as files..  \nIt would be a simple matter of searching the Notes for your specific Tag(s), and then create tempory links (or permanent) to each directory with a matching Tag in the 'Notes`... then put these links into a 'search results' directory... which you would then present in a Nautilus window!...  \nIf I had the spare time, I'd do it myself, but instead, here is a script I wrote to access and write and delete Nautilus Notes..

There you could store information as text. You could later browse them for your information. \nMaybe you're better suited with a tool like find.\nFeel free to ask about it's usage.\n\nA: tracker-utils will work for this. \nHow to search for files by tags?\nThe answer hasn't been accepted yet, but the examples I posted should give you an idea of how to work with this program. Tag additions work just fine on directories too, and I've tested it as well. \nDirectory Example\n<sean@mymachine:~> tracker-tag -a projects src/ code/ projects/\n<sean@mymachine:~> tracker-tag -s projects\nResults: 3\n  /home/sean/projects\n  /home/sean/src\n  /home/sean/code\n\nNote that you'll need to start trackerd manually in order for the tracker-tag/* utils to work: \n<sean@mymachine:~> /usr/lib/tracker/trackerd &\n\nYou can configure tracker with: \n<sean@mymachine:~> tracker-preferences\n\nI still don't have the tracker applet running (listed in ps, but not showing up in nautilus even after nautilus -q), but I don't really care. I don't use GUI tools for the most part; I prefer CLI since it's usually much faster than clicking on things.\nI read one of your responses from an earlier post, and it looks like you're trying to add/search for tags in Nautilus, although you didn't list that as a primary criteria in your question. That's what the other person was doing, so perhaps this answer will be useless for you. That said, jumping to CLI occasionally isn't so bad if you get stuff done that you wouldn't normally be able to do in a GUI. \n", "Q: Clean-up duplications etc. in virtual memory(RAM) My laptops virtual memory(RAM) is very low. I run Ubuntu 10.4. I uninstalled many software programs but still it does not seem to help. I have not installed the regular updates in a couple of months now because of low space. Is there a way of doing a clean-up on file duplications, unnecessary temp files, and unused files that will ease up some space. I never experienced low memory issues when I was running Windows and the painful Vista. I can't see that it should be a problem now.\n\nA: RAM is not virtual. How many RAM do you have? \nfree\n\nUpdates don't occupy RAM, they occupy disk space. How big are your partitions? \ndf -h \n\n/tmp-Files are cleaned on every reboot. Firefox (do you use it? If you are low on RAM, try opera) can produce big caches. You may reduce the size from the settings dialog therein. \nYou may have some cache from installs/updates. \nsudo apt-cache clean \n\nshould erase it. \nOf course, 2 or 3 videos may occupy more space than the whole rest of your OS. \nUnused files is somehow hard to decide. You may look in the menu for applications which you don't need, and remove them with syanptics. \nWhere do you think duplicate files come from? \nYou don't talk about swap-space, when talking about Virtual RAM? \nswapon -s \n\nSwap is exclusively used for swapping. You can gain some diskspace by repartitioning, if you made it much too big. 2x your real memory is a reasonable size. You never do manipulate its content by hand. \n", "Q: I am having trouble 'syncing' my files First, I love ubuntu...thank you...you folks are brilliant!

Finally, I plan to buy a modem, can it work out of box or will I need to tweak something, if so how?\n\nA: I'd like to strongly advise not to get started with Ubuntu using version 11.04. As the name suggests it will be released in next month. Therefore today this is not a stable release but only a development alpha version. It is not thought be be used by end users on there production machines but for testing only. Therefore you will only be unsatisfied with it and this serves nobody.\nThus, please stick with either the latest stable version 10.10 or 10.04 which is the most recent version with an extended support time. However I advise you to install 10.10 as you can easily upgrade later when 11.04 is released and therefore stable and safe to use.\nTo answer your initial question, there should not be any problem with your intel card and compiz as far as I know, however there has just been implemented a big change in the development version which is making problem in 11.04 only, this does not affect the stable version.\nHope I could help you!

This still leaves lots of vectors.\n\nA: You can't protect your data if it's not encrypted, but you can protect root user.

To get a shorter list representation you can use the -short flag.\nYou can make it output the information in several ways.\n\nOption two - hwinfo (needs install)\nhwinfo which you'd have to install. It is in the repositories.\nIt does also present the components in a very detailed fashion. Here the --short flag will give you a nice hardware category sorted list.\nWith the --[hwtype] option you can get detailed information about a selected hardware type only, which is quite handy sometimes.\n\nI don't know of any one-in-all solution to dis/enable hardware or drivers. Drivers generally are kernel modules which you can enable (add) and disable (remove) using the modprobe command.\nUsing lsmod you can find out which modules are currently loaded.\n\nA: There are a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*lspci will show you most of your hardware in a nice quick way. It has varying levels of verbosity so you can get more information out of it with -v and -vv flags if you want it. The -k argument is a good way to find out which kernel driver a piece of hardware is using. -nn will let you simply know the hardware ID which is great for searching.\nBut it is only a very simple, quick way of getting a list of hardware. I often ask people to post the output of it here when trying to identify their wireless hardware. It's great for things like that.\nIt doesn't show USB hardware other than the USB busses.\nHere are three real world examples:\nGraphics:\n$ lspci -nnk | grep VGA -A1\n03:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GF110 [GeForce GTX 580] [10de:1080] (rev a1)\n    Kernel driver in use: nvidia\n\nAudio:\n$lspci -v | grep -A7 -i \"audio\"\n00:01.1 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Good if you want to know what's plugged in.\n\n*sudo lshw will give you a very comprehensive list of hardware and settings.\nIt gives you so much information, I suggest you pipe it through less or output it to a file and open that in something you can move around in:\nsudo lshw | less\n\nOf course this is usually a lot of information. You often only need info on a small subset of your hardware and lshw will let you select a category. If you just wanted to see your network devices, for example, run this:\nsudo lshw -c network\n\n\n*If you want something graphical, I suggest you look at hardinfo. You'll need to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install hardinfo\n\nYou then just run it from the same terminal with hardinfo. I don't know that it has a menu location by default. \nBut it can give you slightly more information (boots, available kernels, etc) than the other options, as well as giving you similar lists of PCI and USB hardware like the first two commands.\nIt also provides some simple benchmarking. I think the developers aim to make it a replacement for Sandra (a popular Windows hardware information gathering tool).\nIt even has options to output a nice report that you can send to somebody (though it can easily be too much information).\n\n\nA: lshw is a very good command that tells you a very detailed information of your hardware. If you don't want to install something else like hardinfo then it will be very good command. But use lshw (you can say list hardware to remember this command) with -html or -xml options to get the information in more interactive way.\nHere it illustrates\n    $ sudo lshw | less (or more)\n    $ sudo lshw -html > myhardware.html\n    $ sudo lshw -xml > myhardware.xml\n\nNow just open .html or .xml files created in your current directory to get a complete description of your hardware.\n\nA: neofetch has already been mentioned but there is also screenfetch which provides even more information when you open your terminal after you put the command in your ~/.bashrc file:\n\nMy terminal splash screen contains four components:\n\n\n*\n\n*Weather\n\n*Calendar\n\n*Time (when terminal was opened)\n\n*screenfetch the system information utility\n\n\nYou can find details for doing this yourself in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal splash screen with Weather, Calendar, Time & Sysinfo?\n\nA: lspci  - PCI hardware\nlsusb, lspcmcia, lshw, lshw-gtk\ndmidecode -information about your system's hardware as described in system BIOS\nkinfocenter\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nA: NeoFetch is a nice command line solution for high level information (if running Ubuntu 14.04 or higher).\nTo install you need to add the PPA first:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dawidd0811/neofetch\n\nThen install:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install neofetch\n\nThen run:\nneofetch\n\n\nUpdate:\nneofetch is available in the Universe repository since 18.04.\nA convenient way to present neofetch data is to use neofetch --stdout.

If you can't use SMB for some reason, sudo apt-get install netatalk.  It doesn't look like netatalk has any bindings for either Gnome-VFS or Nautilus, though, so you'll have to work from a command line.\n\nA: Install afpfs-ng, I installed version 0.8.1 from source using the following directions (I found some old instructions here, but there is a typo so I have adjusted it to match the INSTALL instruction that came with the source files.)\nInstall the dependencies \nsudo apt-get install lbgcrypt-dev libgmap-dev readline-dev libfuse-dev\n\nUnzip the tar.bz2 file, cd into the resulting folder, build and install\ntar -xfz afpfs-ng-0.8.1.tar.bz2\ncd afpfs-ng-0.8.1\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo ldconfig\n\nIt appears that they actually have a .deb file too, see here, but I didn't notice it until I started typing this response.\nAfter installing you can then mount an afp share from the command line, its not quite as nice as just putting afp://share into nautilus, but certainly better than nothing.  Mount using\nafp_client mount -u <user_name> -p <password> <server>:<volume> <mountpoint>\n\nwhere <mountpoint> is a folder that the current user has read and write permissions.  If you use - for password you will be asked for the password interactively, like when you use sudo. I highly recommend this, otherwise your password will be displayed on your screen in plain text.  After all of that, the mount should appear in your nautilus side bar.\nWhen you are done and wish to unmount the share, you can not use the eject button that is displayed in nautilus.  Instead use the following command\nafp_client unmount <mountpoint>\n\nIf you like using the command line, then there is also the command afpcmd that behaves like a command line ftp client.\n\nA: It should work in nautilius as the fisrt user asked for, \nconnect : \nafp://user@ip\nI did install \nsudo apt-get install afpfs-ng\nbut don't think one needs to do it , ubuntu 13.04\n", "Q: Oracle installation script execution privileges: \"oracle is not in the sudoers file\" I'm currently installing Oracle 11g on Ubuntu 10.10\nIt had been asked to execute some scripts as \"root\" while installation.\nI'm doing:\noracle@sergio:/u01/app/oraInventory$ sudo sh orainstRoot.sh\n\nAnd got:\n[sudo] password for oracle: \noracle is not in the sudoers file.

It is uncommon to grant the oracle user sudo access.  This violates the separation of privileges.  \nRun the script using sudo from the account you usually use to install packages and do other things that require root privileges.\n\nA: Oracle user only for accessing Oracle Database and installation files.\nPlease follow below article.  \nInstalling Oracle 11g on Ubuntu\n\nA: Don't start the installation as the \"oracle\" user.

And how can I restore them on any emergency?\n\nA: If you've got a good deal of time on your hands, and can leave your system online, you can do a remote rsync down to your system.\nrsync --recursive --progress user@host:sourcedir /path/to/save/backup/on/local/machine\nThat should do what you want, but it'll take up a ton of space on your computer, because its literally a copy of the data on your VPS.  Note you might want to run this with the root user, if you want a total copy.  Also, this won't preserve the permissions, it'll just give you a copy of the files.\nAbout the Arguments Used Above\nIn case you're curious as to what the arguments for the rsync directory:\nuser@host:sourcedir:  user means the username to use on the VPS (in this case, probably root).  host means the connection address you use for your VPS.  sourcedir means the directory you want to copy from.  In your case of a full VPS backup, you would probably want this to be /.\n/path/to/save/backup/on/local/machine/:  You've got several different options with where you want to store your backup when its on your local drive.  In any case, you will want to make sure you can access this, so you would probably end up with something like /home/user/VPSbackup/ where user is your local username on the local system (not on the VPS)\nThe --recursive argument will copy all files in every subdirectory from sourcedir.\nThe --progress argument will show you the progress of each file as its being downloaded (can be helpful in certain cases), because it can show you the time left to download each file (it'll flood your terminal screen, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you want to see the progress).\nMost  importantly...\nBE VERY VERY VERY CAREFUL!\nAn rsync in which you switch the user@host:sourcedir and the /path/to/save/ arguments will OVERWRITE your VPS with old data or no data.  This can also lead to you breaking things if you specify the wrong /path/to/save/.\n\nA: The question specifies that the server should be backed up while it is running. The question does not say that the solution must be no-cost or open source. The comments indicate that the hosting provider probably doesn't support LVM. (That last assumption makes sense because Linode.com and SliceHost, for example, don't support LVM.)\nIf one is hosting with a VPS such as Linode.com, they offer an inexpensive backup solution. In my case, I pay an extra $5 per month for Linode's backup solution and it seems well worth it to me. It is very simple.\nThe only other option I know of that will meet the criteria stated above is R1Soft's Linux Hot Copy. It is free.\nHere's their own advertising claims for the product. I have not used it yet, although I am seriously considering it. (I'm reading questions like this one as part of my research.) I have no affiliation with R1Soft and I don't have anything to gain by posting this information. I'm posting it because I do not know of any other solution that allows backing up a running server (including system files) other than LVM, btrfs, zfs, other COW file systems, and things that are generally not available on a VPS -- and R1Soft's Linux Hot Copy. It's the only other choice, afaik.\nHot Copy (hcp) - Free Universal Disk Snapshot Utility for Linux Servers\nThe R1Soft Hot Copy utility creates an instant point-in-time volume snapshot of any block device while the system is running without interrupting applications.  Works on almost any Linux block device.  It is like Volume Shadow Copy for Linux.\nHot Copy (hcp) - Universal Disk Snapshots for Linux\nR1Soft Hot Copy (hcp) is the answer to taking online point-in-time disk and volume snapshots in Linux.  Use the hcp command line utility to take an instant snapshot of any mounted file system on almost any block device!\nWindows administrators use Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).  On Linux servers before Hot Copy nothing equivalent existed.  R1Soft created Hot Copy so every Linux server has a universal disk snapshot that is fast and easy to use.\nWhy Hot Copy is the Answer to Linux Disk and Volume Snapshots\nWorks on any server-based file system or block device\nInstall without rebooting\nEliminates LVM pre-requisite\nRequires no pre-allocation or pre-configuration of storage\nUses existing free space on your disk to maintain snapshots\nOutstanding performance compared to LVM snapshots\nWorks on most High-Availability and Shared Storage\nSpecialized performance awareness for: Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, and Reiserfs3\nSnapshots are readable and writable\nKeep multiple snapshots of each disk or volume\n\nWhat you Can Do With Hot Copy\nAdd point-in-time open file backups to your existing backup scripts for free e.g. tar and rsync\nCheck your disk for errors with fsck without rebooting and without unmounting your file system!\nTest scripts and programs in an instant snapshot of your live environment before you use them on real data\nKeep instantly recoverable snapshots available by taking periodic snapshots via cron\n\n\nA: rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local and remote systems\n\nA: You CAN move live system to LVM.\nInstall necessary kernel modules and load them (or compile kernel with appropriate config and reboot VDS).\nAfter that you can move root to LVM, change root FS on live system without reboot. It is possible with \"pivot_root\" and temporary moving root fs to another place (to RAM, for example).\nBut be carefully, it's dangerous.\n\nA: Take an LVM snapshot and back it up with dump.\n", "Q: Default gateway changing I am using 3 ethernet interfaces on Ubuntu but when I restart, the default gateway is changing to a different interface. Each time I boot I have to change default gateway back to the eth1 by deleting the default gateway and adding it back with eth1. How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Open the file /etc/network/interfaces\nfind desired interface and add following:\ngateway 192.x.x.x\n\nRestart network:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\nA: To temporarily change the default route you can use an ip command like this:\n$ sudo ip route change default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0\n\nIf you have a static ip configuration in /etc/network/interfaces you can add a gateway statement to make this permanent.\niface eth0 inet static\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n    […]\n\nUsing DHCP to configure networking you have to adjust another file instead. Add the supersede statement in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf.\nsupersede routers 192.168.1.1;\n\n\nA: I had the same issue for my wifi interface wlp3s0 on Ubuntu 18.04. It was affecting my ability to connect to Android tethering and router outside home. The way to solve the issue for me was to comment in file /etc/dhcpcd.conf the following:\ninterface wlp3s0\n        static ip_address=192.168.0.16/24\n        static routers=192.168.0.1\n        static domain_name_servers=127.0.0.1\n\nto get the following\n#interface wlp3s0\n#        static ip_address=192.168.0.16/24\n#        static routers=192.168.0.1\n#        static domain_name_servers=127.0.0.1\n\nThen, I've disconnected from my current network and reconnected an tried route -n or nmcli to see changes\nYou can also remove the same lines when you are sure it works for you.\nBecause of these lines, the NetworkManager was always adding a default route with a wrong gateway, in particular when I was not on my home network.\nI was getting \"Destination Host Unreachable\" when I was doing a ping 8.8.8.8. Hardcoding a gateway in /etc/network/interfaces was not a viable solution as I connect a lot to public wifis (so, never the same wifi router or gateway) and normally DHCP should work \"out of the box\" IMHO.\nPS: I've never edited manually /etc/dhcpcd.conf so I don't know why the file /etc/dhcpcd.conf did contain these lines. \n", "Q: Network file sharing with Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) How can I share files over the network, between an Ubuntu system (client side) and a macOS system (server side) using Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)?\n\nA: No, people, you've got it backwards.

However, due to some licensing and warranty issues, the recovery section on the disk (the one that enables the \"ThinkVantage\" button) must remain intact.  I install Ubuntu on a dual-boot with a Windows XP partition, and when in Windows, the ThinkVantage button must work.\nDid anyone experienced problems with this, have any advice, or know of precautions that must be taken to ensure this?\n\nA: If you only need it to work in case you return it and have a bit of cash and a screwdriver I'd seriously consider buying a nice SSD and just replacing the current one. Keep it safe and if you need to return it, just switch it back.\nIf (for a reason I don't understand) you constantly need the restore button to work, use something like CloneZilla to take a whole-disk backup to another machine (or an external drive). At least then if you do lose this feature, restoring is pretty simple.\nRestore systems tend to use a separate partition to the standard Windows install. As long as you leave that as-is and just resize (or remove) Windows' partition, you should be fine. But backing up should ensure that.\n\nA: The ThinkVantage button most likely boots off of a specific recovery partition. Use the manual partitioner and split & resize the partition you are SURE is the Windows Partition, which will be NTFS-formatted.\nYou are still encouraged to back your system up before proceeding, or simply replace the disk and keep the original one safe.\nFor licensing and warranty purposes that might even be better - you have a \"known good\" drive you never touch that matches the manufacturer's state. \"Linux was installed on this machine*, so it can't be a software issue.\"\n*'machine' in this case means the factory-shipped configuration, not your modifications.\nI tend to void warranties, YMMV, HTH, HAND.\n\nA: If the \"Rescue and Recovery\" functionality is set up similarly in T500 as in older T-series ThinkPads then ThinkWiki has comprehensive instructions on how to install a Linux distro while keeping the recovery option enabled at boot time. \nThe method I successfully used on a T60 was to install the GRUB bootloader on a partition's boot sector instead of the MBR, keeping the original MBR intact. After that the only thing remaining is to make the system actually boot GRUB from wherever it was installed. With newer Rescue and Recovery versions that may be as easy as just marking the correct partition as active. Another option is to add an entry for it in the Windows bootloader (assuming you keep the Windows partition around).\n\nA: I did this recently on an X201.  It's really easy.  You just choose to resize the partitions in the installer, and you're done.  You get an option in the grub menu for the Windows partition (if you choose to keep that) and the recovery partition.  \n\nA: If the Bios allows usb devices to boot, you can boot to Ubuntu from an usb stick, or external usb hardrive. This way you can have the best of both worlds. Laptop hardrives are easy to remove and put back in. Usually requiring the removal of 2 screws at the bottom of the case.\nA friend of mine had a laptop that work lent him, I just removed the hardrive as a safety precaution. Set Bios Boot Device priority to External Usb Drive, secondary boot device to the internal hardrive. Plugged the USB Drive, put Ubuntu Live Cd in the DVD tray, did the installation without worries (since I removed the internal hardrive). Tested the system, it worked just fine.\nPowered down, reinstall the internal HD. As long as the External USB Hd was not plugged in, it would boot to windows. When his term (contract) was up, he just had to go into bios and change the boot priority back to the original settings.\n", "Q: Why do I get \"permission denied\" errors with Python easy_install?

The process is described in details in this article, and involves modifying the PYTHONPATH environment variable.\n", "Q: Chrome asks for password to unlock keyring on startup In Google Chrome, when I go to a login page, a window pops up asking to \"Enter password for keyring 'default' to unlock\". In most cases, whether I click Cancel or enter my password, the login form gets auto filled anyway.\nHow do I get rid of the popup? I want it to auto login each time, not ask for my system password. The dialog box never appears for any other apps.\n\nA: From the manpage:\n\n--password-store=<basic|gnome|kwallet>\n  Set the password store to use. The default is to automatically detect based on the desktop environment. basic selects the built in, unencrypted password store. gnome selects Gnome keyring. kwallet selects (KDE) KWallet. (Note that KWallet may not work reliably outside KDE.)\n\nThe easiest way to fix that in the launcher is to copy the .desktop file to your home folder and edit it (google chrome users should copy the appropriate file):\ncp /usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\nThen edit the new file such that the Exec line reads like this:\nExec=chromium-browser --password-store=basic %U\nIf you have any other Chromium app installed, their .desktop files should also be in ~/.local/share/applications, edit them accordingly.\n\nA: First make sure libpam-gnome-keyring is installed then log out and back in. \nWhen you open Chrome again it will ask for the password for the keyring but will give you an option to unlock the keyring every time you login. Make sure this is selected and enter your password  to unlock the keyring.\n\nA: Setting your keyring password to your login password should resolve the issue. If you completely remove the password, your keyring will be accessible without a password (i.e. by everybode who has read access).\n\nA: Edit: In fact, you might as well get rid of the keyring popup and the \"your computer is old\" flag at the same time.\nsudo sed -i '/^Exec=/s/$/ --disable-infobars --password-store=basic %U/' /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\n\nOriginal answer\nI made this one-liner to make disabling the password pop-up simple for when I am setting up Ubuntu VMs. I just tested it on an Ubuntu 16.04 system which had Chrome installed (not Chromium).\nsudo sed -i '/^Exec=/s/$/ --password-store=basic %U/' /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\nThis command adds --password-store=basic %U to the end of any line in /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop that begins with Exec=.\nCredit to Capi Etheriel, who's answer I used to develop mine.\n\nA: As described here you can set the keyring password to blank.\nGo to System/Preferences/Password and Encryption keys, right click the appropriate folder and click Change Password. Put in your old password and leave the new one blank.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto Keyring and password\n\n*then, View>By Keyring\n\n*The window will change and will show a left pane. now select Login under Passwords in the left pane. Right click & select'change password'\n\n*Enter the old password and when it prompts the new password just leave it blank.\n\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: First of all, I'm by no means an Ubuntu nor a security expert. I'm just an average user / programmer that wanted to install Chrome on my Ubuntu 16.04 VM running under Parallels.\nI installed Chrome, and was prompted with this annoying keyring password popup, and tried to put in my user's password to no avail.\nThe solution I got to work quite accidently was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Passwords and Keys\n\n*Under \"Passwords\" just delete the Login keyring underneath that\n\n*Ubuntu now will prompt you to create the new password\n\n*Now when you launch Chrome, it won't bother you with the keyring popup anymore! (Well, at least for mine, it didn't.)\n\n\nA: Google Chrome uses Gnome 'login' keyring to securely store passwords. It is usually protected by a password that matches your login password. Gnome keyring can automatically unlock it when the user logs in. When you login normally, the system gives the password you just entered to gnome-keyring, which then unlocks the login keyring.\nSo, why am I being asked to unlock a \"keyring\"?\nThe 'login' keyring password does not match your login password\nWhen the user changes their password, the PAM module changes the password of the 'login' keyring to match.\nIf root changes the password, or /etc/shadow is directly edited then due to the lack of the old password, the 'login' keyring cannot be updated.\nYou have to update the 'login' keyring password manually.\nYou did not enter your password when logging in\nWhen you have auto-login enabled or use another passwordless authentication method (for example 'fingerprint' device), you don't enter any password, and gnome-keyring cannot unlock the keyring automatically. So it asks you to unlock it.\nIf you have enabled disk encryption, LUKS passphrase can be reused to decrypt GNOME keyring even with auto-login. This works in Fedora out of box, but propably requires additional configuration tweaks in Ubuntu and Arch to configure initramfs to use systemd (and, therefore, systemd-cryptsetup).\nOverwise, if you want to have auto-login and auto-unlock,\nyou need to remove the keyring's password (set it to a blank one).\nLinks:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/Pam\n\n*https://nullroute.eu.org/~grawity/gnome-keyring-autologin.html\n\n*https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/issues/613\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/jwnqq5/how_does_fedora_grab_the_luks_password_at_boot_to/\n\nA: You can remove this annoying message by\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to (Unity button)/Passwords and Keys\n\n*On tab Passwords choose the proper key (I'd got only one, so you may need to find proper key).

It can store things in places other than just .meta.  I typically don't recommend getting source files from places, but I would recommend that you to go Eclipse's site and download the prepackaged zip/tar that has the features that you want (they have i think 8 different packagings of eclipse with various plugins, you should be able to find one that does PHP and jquery).  Note that you can later expand on the one package by adding additional plugins for additional functionality.\nEDIT\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/compare.php  <--- that's the site for the Eclipse IDE (which I assume you are using).  I do not see a plugin for JQuery that's prepackaged, but that doesnt mean you can't get what you need from the plugins.

Like, 192.168.1.x computers will be able to reach 192.168.0.x computers, but do you want 192.168.0.x computers to reach 192.168.1.x ? If so, there has to be one more entry in the routing table of those computers.\nYou could actually replace the UBUNTU box between 192.168.0.x and 192.168.1.x with a cheap wired network router. No need to have wireless there. If you don't want 192.168.0.x to access 192.168.1.x, just connect this router with its WAN connection to the 192.168.0.x network, and configure it so that ITS internal network is 192.168.1.x, connect your 192.168.1.x computers to it and you're done.\nAnother solution could be in a \"more intelligent\" router, that could run DD-WRT. This replacement of the firmware will allow multiple segments, both sharing the internet connection, and you then can also establish supplemental routes so that one segment can reach the other segment. \nCheck on the net for DD-WRT (google), and then check there for supporting your existing router. If it is not supported, it is worth getting the right one from your local store. I use a Netgear one, and it works perfectly for me. \n\nA: Some good firewall software should do what you want.  I am partial to Shorewall which is well documented and already packaged for Ubuntu.  The documentation discusses various configurations, including the one you are considering.  \nIt appears you want a variation on the two interface design.

It is activated by a three finger press on a touch screen. You can toggle it by repeatably tapping three fingers on your touchscreen.\nYou can use it with a mouse by toggling the plugin on and off. To ensure the plugin is enabled, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the CompizConfig Setting Manager: Press Alt + F2 to open the run dialog, type ccsm, and press Enter (if that doesn't work, you probably need to install the package compizconfig-settings-manager first).\n\n*The grab handle plugin will only work correctly, if the Png plugin is enabled, so scroll down to the Image Loading section and make sure Png is ticked:\n\n(source: xrmb2.net) \n\n*Now scroll further down to the Uncategorized section and tick the Unity MT Grab Handles plugin:\n\n(source: xrmb2.net) \n\n*By default, there is no shortcut defined to initiate the handles, so click on the Unity MT Grab Handles button to configure the shortcut (and also the fade duration, if you like):\n\n(source: xrmb2.net) \n\n*Next to Toggle Handles click on the Disabled button and tick the Enable checkbox:\n\n(source: xrmb2.net) \n\n*Now click on Grab key combination and press the desired shortcut:\n\n(source: xrmb2.net) \n\n*Confirm and close the CompizConfig Setting Manager.

How can I check that the ISO image I've downloaded is bootable, before I burn it?\n\nA: Performing a cryptographic hash verification of the ISO file you downloaded consists of the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type the following:\nmd5sum \n\nNote: there's a space after the md5sum.\n\n*Now open Nautilus and browse to the folder containing the ISO file.\n\n*Drag the ISO file to the open terminal window. This will insert the path / filename of the ISO file into the terminal window.\n\n*Press Enter in the terminal window.\n\n*The first part of the output is the MD5 hash of the CD.\n\n*Go here and find the directory that corresponds to your release and find the file MD5SUMS. Compare the hash of your ISO file to the appropriate entry in that file.\n\n\nIf the two hashes do not match, then your ISO file is corrupt and you will need to download it again.\n\nA: If you have a good-enough CPU, install VirtualBOX, and setup some Virtual Machine. Make it point to the ISO as the CDROM, and configure it to first boot from CDROM. It willboot from the ISO file directly, without actually having to burn the file. \nAnother thing that I always do, as a general practice, is to actually put the ISO on a USB key and boot from it, which is something now possible with most computers. UNETBOOTIN (just google it) will do this for you. Just expect the USB disk to be completely wiped.\nI now never boot from a CDROM anymore. I can't remember the last time I actually burned a CDROM.\n\nA: isoinfo can probably tell you if it has the right files to boot if you want quick and dirty.\nisoinfo -l -i is_it_bootable.iso will list the directory structure so you can check for files a live cd / bootable cd should have.  \nisoinfo -d -i is_it_bootable.iso will tell you if the CD has an El Torito section.  Ubuntu's live CD iso reports:\nEltorito validation header:\nHid 1\nArch 0 (x86)\nID ''\nKey 55 AA\nEltorito defaultboot header:\n    Bootid 88 (bootable)\n    Boot media 0 (No Emulation Boot)\n    Load segment 0\n    Sys type 0\n    Nsect 4\n    Bootoff 8F 143\n\n\nA: A superficial way is to run file. In the end of the line it prints whether iso is bootable, e.g.\n$ file fd11src.iso\nfd11src.iso: ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data 'FD11SRC' (bootable)\n\nA more profound way is to use an emulator like qemu:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom image.iso -m 512\n\nIf it loads, then everything is fine. Despite the complete emulation, to run it is very easy and not resource-consuming.\nThese methods should work for any Linux distribution.\n\nA: You check the MD5SUM. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM. \nThe iso at http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download is guaranteed by ubuntu to be bootable, a valid MD5SUM therefore asserts that the iso is bootable.\n\nA: HI, for any distro you are trying to download just use LinuxLive Usb creator it will download the right iso for you and verify at the same time hope this helps.\n\nA: It's very simple. We will go step by step...\n\n\n*\n\n*By using PowerISO.\n\n*First download and install PowerISO.\n\n*Open PowerISO.\n\n*Then click on FILE and then on OPEN and browse and open the ISO file.\n\n*When you have opened that ISO file if that file is bootable then in the lower left end, it shows \"Bootable image\". If not a bootable image, then it shows \"Nonbootable image\".\n\n\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"Connect to server...\" and sshfs? Can anyone quickly explain the technical difference between these two methods?\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to Places -> Connect to Server and select SSH (in GNOME)\n\n*Using sshfs in terminal\n\n\nThis probably boils down to GVFS (using FUSE) vs. FUSE \"directly\" (if this is a reasonable comparison). FUSE I somewhat understand what is, but GVFS is a bit cryptic.\nBoth have advantages and disadvantages for me. The former allows easy access to the GUI and you get the opportunity to create a bookmark, but sends you to the root folder of the remote file system (unless you specify otherwise) and mounts in ~/.gvfs/sftp on ... / which an be a bit cumbersome if you want to enter through local terminal. The latter must be done via the terminal (as far as I know) but you can choose which folder you want to \"jump into\" and one can choose for yourself where this will be mounted on your local filesystem.\nOne thing that I find very annoying is that Vim/Gvim destroys permissions on files upon writing if I use GVFS. E.g. if a file permissions has 644, this is set to 600 after Vim/Gvim has edited it. I've seen various bug reports from 2008 on this but I still experience it.\n\nA: Well gnome network connections are gvfs only, not fuse at all. They have no mount points. In order to save and load files from them you need to use a program that supports the GIO calls, which sucks for programmers and means they don't work for KDE apps.\nThe fuse filesystem on the other hand has an actual mount point, so it's easy to see where the files are and it obays normal UNIX logic for saving and loading files. Any application can save and load from the filenames.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to Ubuntu One I am having trouble connecting to Ubuntu One.

How are the patches in debian/patches obtained?\nIs this\ndiff -Nurp folder/original folder1/new\n\nenough?\n\nA: This usually depends on the type of patch system which the package uses.\nThere are 3 types of patch systems for Debian packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quilt (most widely used)\n\n*Cdbs + Simple Patchsys\n\n*dpatch\nAll patch systems store patches in debian/patches. You can use the what-patch command in package ubuntu-dev-tools  to find out which patch system a package is using.\nIntroduction of Quilt:\nQuilt patches can be easily manipulated using the quilt command from a terminal. The quilt command is a part of package quilt .\nThis page will help you getting along with quilt. Also check out the quilt manpage by running\nman quilt\n\nin a terminal.\nNow for cdbs + simple-patchsys:\nThese patches are manipulated commonly by a script called cdbs-edit-patch in package cdbs . You can edit patches like this:\ncdbs-edit-patch *PATCHNAME*\n\nYou can add new patches like this:\ncdbs-edit-patch *NEW_PATCHNAME* *PREV_PATCHNAME*\n\nWhere *PREV_PATCHNAME* is the name of the patch after which *NEW_PATCHNAME* will apply.\ndpatch:\ndpatch  patches can be manipulated using the script dpatch-edit-patch in package dpatch . The usage of dpatch-edit-patch is exactly the same as cdbs-edit-patch above. \n\nA: The section \"Modify upstream files\" of http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/07/04/how-to-prepare-patches-for-debian-packages/ explains how those patches are created when the patch system in use is quilt (which is the most common case thanks to the new source format \"3.0 (quilt)\").\n", "Q: Can I run several distros on one install?

However if you want to have JoliCloud, Mint, etc, then no, you cannot do this (at least not without chanting and doing the rain dance).\n\nA: No, you can not run several distros in one install. The closest you can get to that ideal is by multi-booting multiple distros (info here: http://reddevil62-techhead.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-edit-grub-menu-to-dual-boot.html) or by using a virtual machine for the other distros.\n", "Q: How to perform a detailed and quick 3D performance test I am wondering how to quickly test performance of my 3D graphics. Since glxgears is not benchmark what should I use. Also glxgears sometimes stuck at 60FPS, you cannot even compare before/after driver update (e.g. adding xorg-edgers PPA). Even glxgears doesn't really work out of box.\nOne possibility is screensavers, but you can't see FPS. I am also not willing to install 600MB nexuiz, specially if I am running on Live-CD. Other 3D games are also very big... Unigine tests are too demanding for opensource drivers (problems with too low OpenGL and probably texture compression (S3TC...)). I would also like to test OpenGL 2.x extentions.\nHow to quickly test your 3D performance?\n\nA: Ubuntu since 11.04 comes with benchmarks glmark2 and glmark2-es2 which are quite good to perform simple benchmark (with shader) and are very light for download.\nglmark2 is actively developed by Linaro group. With each new release, new and more demanding benchmarks are coming. https://launchpad.net/glmark2\nBenchmark also runs well on devices (ARM, OpenGL-ES2 based), so it's good (hardware) cross platform comparison. glmark2-es2 running on OMAP4/powervr Pandaboard http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5jg9D1lH5Y\n\nA: gfxbench\nby Kishonti Ltd. is considered a golden standard in the industry.\nYou can download a free version of their benchmark at: https://gfxbench.com/linux-download/\nThen run their scripts:\nsh gfxbench_gl-linux-qt-4.0.13+community_64bit.sh\n./gfxbench_gl\n\nKishonti makes money by selling more specialized versions of those benchmarks, and also source code as well if you pay an expensive license.\nYoutube contains rendering of most of their high level benchmarks, e.g. Car Chase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ9FyMtNdV4\nphoronix-test-suite\nMentioned at https://askubuntu.com/a/33841/52975 , but here go more details.\nOn Ubuntu 16.10:\nsudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite\nphoronix-test-suite list-available-suites\n\nThis gives suite ID, descriptions and type. So just pick one of the graphics suites like pts/mesa (pts == Phoronix Test Suite) and run it:\nphoronix-test-suite run pts/mesa\n\nPTS seems to be a front-end for several benchmarks.\npts/mesa downloads and runs actual FPS games fullscreen, so results might be representative.\n\nA: Unigine has a Linux version of their benchmarks with different shader levels support, could be worth checking out:\nhttp://unigine.com/download/\nThis is also included in the Phoronix test suite, which has lots of other automated graphics (and other) testing options as well.\nhttp://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/\nIn short, use the software centre to install php5-cli as a dependency for Phoronix, then download the Phoronix tarball and extract it. Detailed usage manuals can be found on the Phoronix site.\n\nA: The chromium-bsu and gltron games in Ubuntu have a much smaller installation footprint than nexuiz and both feature a FPS counter. If I wanted to quickly test, I'd go this way.\n\nA: glxgears stuck to 60fps may be due to VSync signal synchronization.

A friend and I both use Ubuntu (and Windows when he's at work). In order to keep tabs on what the other is listening to, is there a way notifications of the currently-playing track of another person over the net can be shown in Ubuntu?\nWe currently use the Clementine music player (Windows and Ubuntu), but I'd be open to alternatives if that can't be used. Pidgin can be set to display the track in the status, of course, but an OSD message would be great.\nPerhaps using a web app in the middle like last.fm might facilitate this somehow?\n\nA: I don't know about clementine, but both rhythmbox and banshee supports this kind of integration with a plugin. I don't use both banshee, rhythmbox or clementine but as far as I remember I think rhythmbox and banshee have instant messenger integration plugin in their preference. If you can't find it:\nhere is status plugin for banshe\nhere is status plugin for rhythmbox\nEdit: see this thread on rhythmbox and IM status\n\nA: I think last.fm is a great idea.  I like that it updates the same place whether I'm listening on the computer or using my phone.  I can't speak beyond Android, but most Android media players can update last.fm.\nYou're looking for true \"push\" notifications, I'm not aware of any.  The main options seem to be last.fm or IM status updaters as sagarchalise suggested.\nLast.fm is also interesting for the stat collection.  So after a while you might notice your friend likes a particular artist.  You can click through their profile to also look at which of that artist's songs they've played the most.  Or look at your own habits.  It's pretty neat.\n\nA: When I used meego that had a last.fm client that like twitter used to show what friends were listening to alongside twitter updates.

I remember doing it on Windows but there as soon as I plugged my headset Skyped prompted me with a message asking me if I wanted to switch to them.\nI see there's a option in skype within Sound Devices, but all it says is PulseAudio server (local) in all Microphone, Speakers and Ringing select boxes with no other option.\nI'm using ubuntu 10.10, and it is a rather fresh install.

I tried login out, rebooting but no luck. I'm on 10.10 by the way.\nDoes anyone know what could be wrong?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You have two options.\nYou can use a script that will do this for you, or you can follow the guide manually - they'll both have the same results, and they'll both do the same thing, the only difference is that the script won't require you to copy/paste anything after you select the method of installation in the script itself.\nKeep in mind that the script will update your system and install various dependencies.You will after be asked if you want to install it system-wide [1] or for your local user [2] - if you want to use the same basic method as the guide below, choose [2]\nTo use this script, you simply run the following:\nwget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/joshfng/railsready/master/railsready.sh && bash railsready.sh\nThis is a different way of installing Ruby and gems that while it doesn't necessarily fix your problem per se, it does provide a way for you to get Ruby working on your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install git and curl. To do that, open a terminal by hitting \"Alt-F2\", and typing gnome-terminal into the resulting dialog. Next, hit \"enter\" to launch the terminal. Now, copy and paste the following line into the terminal.\n\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git curl -y\nHit enter, and now you can just sit back and relax for a few minutes while it installs.\nDownload and install RVM.\nTo download and install RVM, use the following line of command-line magic.\n bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)\n\nNow that you've got that installed, you have to add it to your terminal's path, which tells the terminal where to find all of the commands. To do that, type \"gedit ./.bashrc\" into your terminal, then past the following line down at the very bottom.\n[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && . \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" # This loads RVM into a shell session.\nNow, close your terminal, and open a new one by typing \"Alt-F2\" and typing in gnome-terminal.\nNow you're ready to install ruby itself. But before you can do that, you have to install all the stuff that you need for RVM to install Ruby. To do that, you have to run the following command.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev -y\nYou're probably asking yourself \"What the heck does all THAT do?!!\". Well, here's the answer: Mostly has to do with compiling ruby, which you'll do in a second.\nTo install ruby 1.9.2 (Which is the most recent version as of writing), you need to type the following in your command prompt.\nrvm install 1.9.2\nhit enter, and then go grab a snack. This step is going to take awhile. \nNow that you've taken your last walk for awhile (Or whatever the heck you just did while ruby compiled), it's time to create a gemset.\nOne of the nicest things about RVM is that it lets you have multiple versions of Ruby installed, something that you'll want to use as you get further along in programming Ruby. So, here's how to create a gemset.\nrvm --create use 1.9.2@first-gemset && rvm --default use 1.9.2@first-gemset\nCongrats! Now, you can test and see if RVM did it's job by typing in the following line.\nruby -v\nIt should spit out something like this:\nruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18 revision 30909) [i686-linux]\nCongrats! You've got rvm and Ruby installed successfully. Now, you can install Rails (Or any gem) by typing in this:\ngem install <gem name>\nNote: replace  with the name of the gem you're trying to install\n\nA: Ruby 1.8 is the default version packaged for Ubuntu, and the gem command is provided by a package rubygems1.8. The package that you installed contains the gem1.9.1 command (notice the suffix), which should be used in order to install gems for Ruby 1.9.\n", "Q: Where to put One-Off Computer-Wide Software Folders? I am pretty new to Linux so pardon the ignorance.\nI am installing an application (a wiki server) on my system but am not doing so through aptitude as I can only grab a tar.gz of the package.  This application will really be used by all users so it doesn't feel appropriate to install it in my home directory.  Where should I put the folder of files?  I would think that /usr/bin is the place, but I usually just see binary and linked files in there, which leads me to believe I should have the folder elsewhere and then drop a link to the executable in the /usr/bin folder.  \nThanks!\n\nA: One good place to put this is under /srv, typically something like /srv/wiki.example.com.  The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard endorses this location.\nAnother option is something like /home/wiki or /home/httpd.\nPutting it in /usr/bin is not a good idea; that should be reserved for programs installed by Ubuntu.\n/usr/local/bin is a better place to put a symlink to the program.\n\nA: I did not know about /srv, so +1 to poolie, but I would personally simply use /usr/local/, /usr/share/, or /usr/local/share.

(They mounted at /media/volumename - do I just set permissions on the folder \"volumename\" before mounting?)\n\n*How can I tell TrueCrypt to dismount them when I log out?\n\nA: First, I think you have to only modify the folder's rights and make yourself the owner, so other's cannot see the it.\nAs for the dismount problem, you can create scripts that will autorun on logout. These are stored in /etc/gdm/PostSession. From the GDM reference:\n\nWhen the user terminates his session, the PostSession script will be run. Operation is similar to Init and PreSession. That is, GDM will attempt to execute the script PostSession/ and if that doesn't exist PostSession/Default will be run. Again the script will be run with root priviledges, the slave daemon will block and the $USER environment variable will contain the name of the user who just logged out.\n\nSo basically you have to create a post-session script, that shall contain:\n#!/bin/sh\ntruecrypt -d\n\nThis will dismount all mounted TrueCrypt volumes.\n", "Q: How do I get started with an Ubuntu friendly GUI framework?

It is however very opinionated on the software to use, eg for GUI it uses PyGTK.\nMy own experience from looking into the Python GUI frameworks is that there is no single best one. Some say wxPython is the way to go, others PyQT. However I believe a lot of the Ubuntu specific software is done using PyGTK.\n\nA: There is zenity  for example.\nAs far as I know it does not provide a Python API but you can very easily configure the dialogs using its command line options. In fact it is actually meant for use in shell scripts but I don't see any reason to not use it in conjunction with Python.\nFor more information on all of its options I'd like to point you to the Zenity man page.\nHere is a simple example on how to use it from a shell script.\nThis is only if you don't want to go with a more sophisticated solution.

When i actually play any audio the buzzing/static sound goes away, So its not really a big problem. This problem only happens with the headphones on.\nI'm running Ubuntu 10.10, How can i fix this?\n\nA: For me this was because my microphone was set to be amplified back to my headphones. If you happen to have a mic, just check to make sure your own voice isn't being amplified. If it is, play around with alsamixer (in my case it was one of the playback sliders) until your own voice is no longer amplified.\n\nA: Do you use Skype? I had the same problem when I allowed Skype to adjust the audio settings. After unchecking that option in Skype, the humming is gone.\n\nA: I realize this question is older, but for me this happens when I have \"Mic Boost\" turned up in alsamixer. Turned that down always removes any buzzing on my computer.\n\nA: I turned off the \"Loopback Mix\" in alsamixer and it went away. It was essentially the headphone audio being looped to the headphones/speakers.\n\nA: Unplug your audio on the motherboard and plug it back in, now it should work... I had the same problem and I thought I had just blown out my turtle beaches.\n", "Q: Lingot not detecting sound from microphone I installed lingot(guitar tuner- http://freshmeat.net/projects/lingot/) on Ubuntu but it doesn't seem to be detecting the sounds from the microphone. I'm using Ubuntu 10.10. Thanks\n\nA: Lingot's default sound input device is set to a raw Alsa input (e.g. plughw:0). In the Ubuntu desktop these inputs are opened in exclusive mode by PulseAudio, preventing other applications from opening them.\nThe solution is to make Lingot use the sound input device provided by PulseAudio, which is called pulse.\nEither edit Lingot's configuration file $HOME/.lingot/lingot.conf and set \nAUDIO_SYSTEM = ALSA\nAUDIO_DEV_ALSA = pulse\n\nor open Lingot's preferences window and set Audio System to ALSA and Audio Device to pulse.\n\nA: Update 2019\nOn another system I needed to set Audio device to plughw:1,0 as explained in this answer.\nPrevious answer\nThanks @zwets your answer is the correct one. I'm just posting a screenshot of the preferences menu, in case it helps someone. Lingot's configuration is set as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio system set to Alsa\n\n*Audio device set to pulse\n\n\n\nYou can see in the main Lingot window that my guitar is playing the E string. \n", "Q: Soundblaster gives only fizzing sound Since Windows 7 utterly failed to recognise my built-in audio card, I figured I'd just buy a SoundBlaster. At first everything was fine, it worked perfectly in both Windows and Linux. However, now, when I boot Kubuntu, computer doesn't produce any legible sound. Whenever there should be any sound (like on system start or with some notifications), speakers just fizz at the top of their voice. It works fine in Windows, so it shouldn't be a hardware problem. What can be wrong?\nI'm running Kubuntu 10.10. Also maybe I should mention that I bought and installed SoundBlaster after installing Kubuntu.\n\nA: Let's try the simple things first. Have you tried reconfiguring audio in Kubuntu? That might just resolve the issue right there. If you changed your hardware, you might just have to simply reset the configuration in Kubuntu (don't use Kubuntu, but it may be that simple). \nKnow that when you switch a piece of hardware, it can alter the system and if the system starts up with the older settings, then this may account for the \"fizzing\" sound.\nTry resetting the hardware configuration for sound and see how that works. Might resolve this quickly and easily. Sound Blasters are not unknown, unless it is some  Windows-only model.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Which edition fits my notebook? I have a new notebook:\nwith \n1.33G Duo Core\n2G Memory\nand 100g disk space\nWhich edition fits my computer?\nNetbook or desktop?\n\nA: Netbook Edition is optimized for small screens (and using already Unity, that is coming in 11.04 Desktop Edition) and easy use for portability.

Also your router should be ignoring those requests unless you have explicitly configured it to forward them to your computer.\n", "Q: Using the SHIFT key in Terminal I am very new to Linux, please excuse me if this is a very simple question and point me to the things I need to read. But I've been unable to find an answer so far.\nIn Terminal, when I am trying to select the text in the command line by pressing Shift + Left or Right, I get \"D\" and \"C\" typed instead. (Shift + Up yields A and Shift + Down B). I've read somewhere how to copy-paste using the mouse; I cannot imagine the Terminal doesn't provide for full keyboard control.\nNote: Ctrl + Left or Right moves the cursor around as it should, but Ctrl + Shift + Left or Right still types D and C. Puzzled.\n\nA: Seems to be a known bug - see here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vte/+bug/546021 and the upstream bug here https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=617646\nCopy paste works with Ctrl-Shift-C and -V, respectively. Basically all relevant shortcuts you know from other Gnome applications can be applied in the terminal by adding an additional Shift- keypress... Ctrl-Shift-Q for quit, for example. \n\nA: screen is a, well, it describes itself as a terminal multiplexer. It provides an enhanced terminal environment and includes a mechanism for text selection and copy/pasting using just keyboard. CTRL+[ lets you roam the buffer with a cursor. Press enter or space to start the selection, then again to finish the copy and exit roaming mode. CTRL+] pastes your selection.\nGoing this route (which I can't live without: GNU screen is one of the first things I install on any new computer), you find byobu less intimidating. Screen is a beast to configure, byobu makes it look beautiful.\ntmux is another terminal multiplexer with similar functionality. Apparently it has a bunch of improvements over screen, not least of which is a sane configuration file.\n", "Q: Banshee \"Encountered a Fatal Error\" on launch See screenshot below, these problems had been diagnosed as I open my Banshee.\n\n\nA: This means that the SQLite database that Banshee uses to store information about your tracks and playlists is corrupt.  This can happen if your system loses power or crashes while Banshee is running.  It's usually possible to recover from this error, and there's a bug report in progress that would enable Banshee to automatically attempt recovery.\nFor more information, see my answer to a similar question: Banshee encountered a Fatal Error (sqlite error 11: database disk image is malformed)\n\nA: Simply delete banshee.db in ~/.config/banshee-1 and start it again.\n", "Q: How to find manually installed packages? I installed a plain Ubuntu 10.10 on my computer and installed some software via apt-get. Last week I managed to break everything and just started from scratch, and I need to reinstall my software. Is there some way to create a list with all the packages that I have installed manually?\nSo that it would give me a list like texlive, ... and not texlive, texlive-dep1, textlive-dep2, ... and all the standard packages removed?\nIf I could somehow figure out which programs out of the regular install I have removed, that would be awesome too!\n\nUpdate 2015-05-23: I now use Ansible as configuration management on my systems. There I specify the packages to install. This serves the goal, installing all the programs on a fresh system, even better. So this question might be the entry into some light configuration management.\n\nA: You could use apt-mark, but I recommend debfoster:\nsudo apt-get install debfoster\nsudo debfoster\n\nThis will inspect all installed packages and figure out which ones are keeping the others installed:\ntexlive-full is keeping the following 161 packages installed:\n  cm-super cm-super-minimal context doc-base dvipng feynmf\n  fonts-gfs-artemisia fonts-gfs-baskerville fonts-gfs-bodoni-classic\n  ...\nKeep texlive-full? [Ynpsiuqx?], [H]elp:\n\nAs you answer \"y\" to each question (just push Enter to move quickly), debfoster will collect the package list and write them line-by-line to a file. By default this is at /var/lib/debfoster/keepers. It looks like this:\ngnome-do\ntexlive-full\n...\n\nI configure debfoster via /etc/debfoster.conf to put this list at /etc/debfoster-keepers and track the file with etckeeper to keep history and backups. The answer here shows how to install a list of packages from a newline-delimited text file:\nsudo apt-mark manual $(cat debfoster-keepers)\n\nNote a limitation here, packages you purged have a '-' in front of them. So you want to remove those lines before calling apt-mark.\nEven though the debfoster's website says that debfoster is deprecated in favor of aptitude, I prefer debfoster's prompt and simple configuration. It puts you in the middle of your package database and lets you clean things up, making the auto and manual packages more obvious.\nType \"h\" at the debfoster prompt to explain your options. Type \"?\" to see the package description. The how-to here might be useful.\n\nA: comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort -u) <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort -u)\n\nGives all manually installed packages (not system packages, not dependencies). For examples it shows build-essential but not gcc. \n\nA: For those who prefer using apt-* tools, there's an apt-mark utility that allows both querying and modifying manual/auto state.\napt-mark showmanual\n\nYou can also specify pattern for packages you interested in:\napt-mark showmanual qemu\\*\n\n\nA: With this suggestion, I'm assuming your old installation will still boot!\nTo replicate one set of packages on another machine:\nOn System A, run:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > my-selections\n\nMove the my-selections file over to System B.\nOn System B, run:\ndpkg --set-selections < my-selections\n\nand then:\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nImportant note: if you have installed packages from non-standard repositories and/or PPAs, you will also want to copy /etc/apt/sources.list and the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ from System A to System B before you run the upgrade.\nYou can use dpkg to see what you've removed as well (NB: this will also include packages that you manually installed and removed):\ndpkg --get-selections | grep deinstall\n\nYou can see your results in the terminal, or, of course, redirect to a file.\n\nA: This thread from superuser.com gives this solution:\naptitude search '?installed ?not(?automatic)'\n\n\nA: I finally got it now:\noutfile=\"$(mktemp)\"\npattern='(\\[INSTALLIEREN\\]|\\[INSTALL\\])'\n\nif [[ -f \"/var/log/aptitude.1.gz\" ]]\nthen\n        gunzip -c /var/log/aptitude.*.gz | grep -E \"$pattern\" | awk '{ print $2; }' > \"$outfile\"\nfi\n\nif [[ -f \"/var/log/aptitude\" ]]\nthen\n        grep -E \"$pattern\" \"/var/log/aptitude\" | awk '{ print $2; }' >> \"$outfile\"\nfi\n\nsort \"$outfile\"\nrm \"$outfile\"\n\n\nA: I'm able to pull everything by opening the log files in /var/log/apt/\nI then go in and manually filter out the apt-get install packages.

This will create a /etc/ddclient.conf file that can be further edited to meet your needs, e.g.for the service you use for IP detection.\nTo make your lokal client accessible remotely you need to forward ports for the given remote services to your local client. You may also need to configure PAT or NPAT if many clients share a public IP.\nIf you don't have access to your router you can try to setup a SSH tunnel on existing open ports (see here and there).

Basically, although the files play fine, if I want to fast forward I get this annoying squeaky sound, in other words the transition is not smooth. Strangely enough, if I play the same files in VLC and I fast forward, I don't get that behavior and the transition is very smooth. Is it a codec issue? How can this be fixed? Any ideas anyone?\nBest regards. \n\nA: You might consider trying the Fluendo Playback Pack.  It's not free software, but as far as gstreamer apps go (Banshee, Rhythmbox, Totem, et al.), it's hard to beat the Fluendo codec support.  The phrase \"Just Works\" comes to mind.  Good luck!\nIf you are on Maverick (10.10) or above, it's also available for purchase in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nNOTE:  as other commenters have mentioned, the Fluendo mp3 codec is free and also in the Software Center.  The Playback Pack is better advice for a video problem than a sound/mp3 problem.\n\nA: You don't have to buy anything to have sound playing alright in your computer. At least I have never needed to.\nBut yes, I think we are looking at a problem with gstreamer. You should report a bug in the Gnome Bugzilla.\n\nA: If you only wish to play MP3's the Fluendo codec for MP3 is free.\nIt is the other codecs they charge for.\nSo simply search for MP3 in the software centre install and enjoy.\n\nA: I added all the fluendo codecs.

I do not want to change the actual order of the pages.\nIs there\nA) A way to do this at all using free tools; and\nB) A way to do this \"in batch\" (so, without having to renumber each page manually).\n\nA: There is a little python script, that can do the job: https://github.com/lovasoa/pagelabels-py\nIn your case call: \n./addpagelabels.py --delete file.pdf\n./addpagelabels.py --startpage 1 --type 'roman lowercase' file.pdf\n./addpagelabels.py --startpage 4 --type arabic file.pdf\n\n\nA: There's a tool called PDF Mod which is a free tool to rearrange the pages of a PDF.\nIt can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Centre in Ubuntu 10.10 and higher.\nTo install in Ubuntu 9.10 or 10.04 : \nTo install Add the ppa ppa:pdfmod-team/ppa to your software sources (Here's how to do that) and install pdfmod from the software center\nAdapted from : http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/edit-pdf-documents-in-linux-with-pdf.html\nGood Luck :D\n\nA: Just found a pointer that it could be possible to use ghostscript for this, here: pdftk - Add and edit bookmarks to pdf - Unix and Linux - Stack Exchange #18600; it refers to links: \n\n\n*\n\n*[other] how to generate bookmarks via ghostscript/pdfwrite/pdfmark - Ubuntu Forums\n\n*Ghostcript PDF Reference & Tips — Milan Kupcevic\nHowever, the above deal with bookmarks - not with logical pagination. It turns out from pdfmarkReference.pdf, the needed \"command\" is '/Label' (or '/PAGELABEL') - and it further refers to PDFReference.pdf chapter 8.3.1 \"Page Labels\". Unfortunately, that chapter doesn't necessarrily explain how pdfmarks could be used with page labels - but this post does: \n\n\n*\n\n*[gs-bugs] [Bug 691889] pdfwrite with \"/PAGELABEL pdfmark\" operator does not work with multiple pages\n\nThe /PAGELABEL pdfmark does not have any /Page key, so one can set the \n  label for the ‘current’ page only (and, as a consequence, only for one \n  page at a time). Since you call it at the very beginning, it’s expected \n  to set a label for the 1st page and only for it.\nMultiple /PAGELABELs for the same page: the pdfmark reference says the \n  last one takes effect, so the result of your 1st commandline is OK. \n  Note the /Page key is ignored.\nHow to set page labels from PostScript? I can think of 2 methods:\n(A) The 100% documented way:\nIssue a /PAGELABEL as part of each page.\n(B) The less documented way:\n  ...\n\ngswin32c -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=50pages.pdf -dNOPAUSE\n\nGS>[/_objdef {pl} /type /dict /OBJ pdfmark\nGS>[{pl} <</Nums [0 <</P (Page ) /S /r /St 10>> 2 <<>>]>> /PUT pdfmark\nGS>[{Catalog} <</PageLabels {pl}>> /PUT pdfmark\nGS>50 { showpage } repeat\nGS>quit\n\n... and further in that thread:\n\nAs to making this work; since the original file is a PDF file, you can run each\n  page from the file individually. So you can set the PAGELABEL pdfmark for page\n  1, run page 1 from the original file, set the PAGELABEL for page 2, run page 2\n  from the original file and so on.\nBecause the label is (as SaGS) said applied to the current page, this should\n  correctly set the labels for each page in the output PDF file.\n  (caveat: I haven't actually tried this)\n\nEDIT: just to show this - if you have this saved as pdfmarks file:\n[ /Label (-1) /PAGELABEL pdfmark\nshowpage\n[ /Label (0) /PAGELABEL pdfmark\nshowpage\n[ /Label (1) /PAGELABEL pdfmark\nshowpage\n\n... and you call: \ngs -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=outfile.pdf infile.pdf pdfmarks\n\n... then you will get three empty pages appended at the end of infile.pdf, labeled -1, 0 and 1 :) \n \nWell, maybe this helps sometime to get a simpler gs script for renumbering pages :)\nCheers!\n \nEDIT2: Got it, I think - use same gs command as above - and below are the contents of the pdfmarks script, which will renumber the infile.pdf, so it starts with -1, 0, 1 ...

It uses the pdfpages package to include the scanned PDF (here called scan.pdf). The PDF page labels you want can be set using the hyperref package with the pdfpagelabels option enabled. It uses the normal \\thepage macro as a label which can be defined to lower case roman numbers. The page counter is then reset and changed back to normal numbers.\n\\documentclass[a4paper]{article}% or use 'letterpaper'\n\\usepackage{pdfpages}\n\\usepackage[pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}\n\\begin{document}\n% Set lower case roman numbers (\\Roman would be upper case):\n\\renewcommand{\\thepage}{\\roman{page}}\n\\includepdf[pages=1-3]{scan.pdf}\n% Back to normal (arabic) numbers:\n\\renewcommand{\\thepage}{\\arabic{page}}\n% Reset page counter to 1:\n\\setcounter{page}{1}\n\\includepdf[pages=4-]{scan.pdf}\n\\end{document}\n\nPlace the above code into a file (e.g. scan_mod.tex) and compile it with pdflatex:\n# pdflatex scan_mod\n\nThis will produce scan_mod.pdf. However any special annotations incl. hyperlinks will disappear. This shouldn't be any problem with scanned PDFs.\nIf you need this more often you could write a script which accepts the number of roman numbered pages and the file name(s) as arguments and creates a tempfile with the above code where the name and numbers are variables, which is then compiled.\n\nA: You can do that with a text editor.\n\n\n*\n\n*metadata - How to change internal page numbers in the meta data of a PDF? - Super User\nAs the answer says, open a PDF file with a text editor, search /Catalog entry, and then append an entry named /PageLabels like this:\n/PageLabels << /Nums [\n0 << /P (cover) >> % labels 1st page with the string \"cover\"\n1 << /S /r >> % numbers pages 2-6 in small roman numerals\n6 << /S /D >> % numbers pages 7-x in decimal arabic numerals\n]\n>>\n\nNote that the page indices (physical page numbers) begin with 0.\nOf cource, you can do this automatically using scripting languages.\nPDF Standards - Page Labels has detailed specification.\n\nA: jPDF Tweak is an Open Source graphical utility that offers page numbering (the correct term is \"page labeling\") and many other beginner to advanced PDF editing features.

It runs Unity just fine.\nWhat exactly is being installed with the experimental driver? How is it different from the default driver that Ubuntu uses when it detects an Nvidia card?\n\nA: The driver it is talking about is the nouveau driver, which is FOSS.  Typically that driver only does 2D.  3D support is not finished and is still experimental.  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveau_(graphics)\nThe idea is that this driver will eventually replace the other one, which is by NVidia and not FOSS, ie proprietary.  \n\nA: The most common case would be that this experimental driver is a pre-release version, in which case you are installing a driver that is newer than the released driver, but also still in development.\nYour driver may be more capable than the official non-experimental driver, but it may also give unwanted behavior. So, if you don't need the newest graphic drivers and are not willing to tolerate malfunctioning, you are probably better off with the non-experimental driver.\n", "Q: Failed to fetch

Now I'm facing problem both in update and upgrade(release upgrade too). Is there a way to restore everything to its default, or anything else...\n\nA: Me too had the problem, i am from India. So by default india servers selected. I changed it simply by going to \"System\" menu and on submenu \"Administration\" selected \"Software sources\". Their changing india server to \"main\" server not helped me. \nSo clicked the \"other\" option in \"Download from\" and then clicked on \"select best server\" button, which inturn tested 350 servers and selected the best reachable servers. After that no errors, all my update went so nicely and speedy too.\ntry the same. \n\nA: You could try an other mirror, like http://archive.ubuntu.com/. Run the next command to replace all occurrences of http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ with http://archive.ubuntu.com/:\nsudo sed 's@http://in\\.archive\\.ubuntu\\.com/@http://archive.ubuntu.com/@' -i /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNext, proceed with an update:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nFollowed by an upgrade or install:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install [package-name]\n\nIf it does not help, you can undo the previous change:\nsudo sed 's@http://archive\\.ubuntu\\.com/@http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/@' -i /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\nA: run the command \"sudo /usr/bin/software-properties-gtk\"\n1)It will open the software sources window,then select download from other,then select Best server,it will check the best server for you.\n2)choose that server.close the window,now run the \"sudo apt-get update\"\n\nA: You run into much of the same errors if you build a docker container from an outdated image. I had this with W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found, and it also showed the failed index downloads.\nIf you put the image tag a step higher, it can download from the URL again. Not sure how this might help when dealing with a Linux upgrade, but it may help those who run into this warning: W: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead. and see such version conflicts. If you can, play around with the versions.\n", "Q: How to write terminal contents into a file Here's my situation:\nI open terminal and run program which displays live feed in terminal (text) what changes every second. Only \"Enter\" key can be used while this program is running (it exits that program). So you can't type anything else into console.\nI would like to write that terminal contents into a file, like after every second.\nHow do I do it? By opening 2nd console and using some command? Can't get it work with setterm -dump command.\n\nA: Try using the script command.  Unfortunately, it puts a lot of control character gobbledegook in the transcript.  However, if you see this link at the NCSSM CS Site you will find an imperfect but pretty good solution to the problem.\n\nA: You can pipe your output to the tee program (description):\nmy_program ... | tee my_program.log\n\nThis will show the ouput on the terminal, but also write it to the file my_program.log\n\nA: When you are executing your command from terminal instead of seeing the output on your console you can redirect it straight to a file. While the program runs your the output is going to be written to the file. An example lets say you want to write the contents of your folder with an ls command to a file called list.txt\nls > list.txt\n\nThe > operator redirects your output according to your needs.\n", "Q: Gedit F9 side pane shortcut is not working I am using gedit for some editing and when I use F9 in order to make side pane visible or invisible my display is just getting dim and nothing happens. \n\nA: You have widget layer turned on and  mapped to F9 in Compiz Config\n\nA: I'm guessing that your keyboard has the brightness adjustment bound to Fn-F9. Are you sure your Fn key is not stuck? Maybe your keyboard has a Fn-Lock mode, similar to Num-Lock, and you enabled it by accident?\n", "Q: Font corruption on a netbook Lately I'm getting really weird font issues. I'm not sure what to make of it. Here's a picture.\n\nA: Two possibilities that come to mind, after seeing your picture.\nVideo card driver may have been updated and creating the problem, ie not refreshing properly. Minimize then Maximize any application window, if font gets corrected then it is the video card driver.\nor\nIt could be the video card is overheating. Use those compressed air cans to clean the vents of the netbook/laptop. Make sure your netbook has good ventilation and that the vents are not obstructed.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu use Launchpad instead of GitHub or Bitbucket? I've been wondering why most Ubuntu projects use Launchpad.net instead of GitHub for the Version Control and bug tracking system. Is there a specific reason as to why Ubuntu uses launchpad (and hence bzr)?\n\nA: This list contains the reasons why it did not use back then and why it should not move now\n\n*\n\n*Launchpad used Bazaar which was\ndeveloped long back. GitHub did not\nexist that time (as Robin said)\nLaunchpad was launched in 2004 and\nGitHub in 2008\n\n\n*GitHub is not open source. GitLab or\nGitorious would be a better choice\nin this case. I know Launchpad was\nnot FOSS initially, but it was\nreleased later\n\n\n*Initially GitHub did not have many\nfeatures which Launchpad had, like\nteams. GitHub does not have a build system\nintegrated with it, like PPA\n\n\n*Many projects in Launchpad heavily\nmake use of the \"Merge request\" functionality\nwhich has very basic support in GitHub. It\nis called \"Pull request\" but Launchpad has better\nfeatures and more detailed than GitHub\n\n\n*GitHub's Bug Tracker is next to useless (this\nmay have changed by 2021). My pet project for\na bug tracker might be more useful\n\n\n*Launchpad is owned by Canonical and they pay\nthe developers. They have the complete control\nover their product. GitHub also is owned by\nGitHub/Microsoft.\n\n\n*GitHub uses Git for tracking releases using\nbranches and tags. In Launchpad, which uses Bazaar\nalso has this feature, but Launchpad explicitly\nenforces this outside the source control system.\nThis would be a bit more easier for people who\nhave to handle versions but don't want to dig\ninside the source code.\n\nJust a small note: Github vs. Launchpad and git vs. bzr is sort of religious topic. I want to stay away from this endless discussion. I use which fits the use-case.\n\nA: Zed Shaw covered this topic very well in a recent blog post, Launchpad vs. Github/SysAdmin vs. Coder.\n\nI saw this blog post by lvh asking the simple question, \"Why do people hate launchpad so much?\" It was something I also wondered until I started tinkering with forking NetBSD pkgsrc and went to research various package managers. When I was going through all the various package managers I finally realized that the difference between Launchpad and Github is actually the difference between System Administrators and Software Developers.\n\nI don't entirely agree with his assessments of Launchpad's features outside of code management. As a developer, I do prefer Github's repo view, but Launchpad's bug tracker is far, far superior to Github's. \n\nA: I guess the simple answer is that Launchpad does a lot of stuff that other systems don't (and this was even more true back when Ubuntu started using Launchpad).\nSome examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bug tracker that lets you track bugs in multiple contexts (e.g. a bug that affects multiple packages, or affects both a package and its upstream, or the same package in multiple distributions).\n\n*A web based translation tool.\n\n*A tool to manage the package archive and build binary packages for the various supported architectures.\n\n\nWhile code hosting is an important feature of Launchpad, it is not the only one and it wasn't the first feature Ubuntu used.\nAs for upstream projects related to Ubuntu, there are benefits to using the same system as Ubuntu itself.  Just one example is tracking bugs in both upstream and packaged contexts.\n\nA: I actually think it's more like \"why do they use bzr, and hence launchpad\"? Canonical invested money and people into developing bzr and its precursor baz, long before GitHub existed, and they probably don't want to throw away all of that accumulated expertise and investment now. Indeed, baz was started before git existed.\nAlso, with Launchpad being controlled by them, they can more easily add features that make sense for them - whereas GitHub is not even open source, and certainly not under their control!\n", "Q: Can I force my Huawei E1550 modem to be usable on another network? I have huawei e1550 3g modem and it is locked to network operator \"Idea\" while using through windows(which I don't like). \nIs it possible to use another network operator on this modem on ubuntu or Is it also locked for ubuntu?\nI am able to access internet using it via the default network operator, but not by another operator.Is it my fault or Its also locked on ubuntu? But I have entered the correct settings.\nWhile checking for network locks using ixconn I found the following:-\n* Test for netlock           \n\nManufacturer: huawei    \nModel: E1550    \nRevision: 11.608.13.02.00    \nIMEI: 354638041122655    \n+GCAP: +CGSM,+FCLASS,+DS\n\nOK    \n--- No network locks recognized. ---\n\nand it also shows the n/w operators  availabe on doing gprs n/w analysis\non doing AT^CARDLOCK?\ni got 3,0,0\nwhich mean that this can't be unlocked\non connecting to internet it keeps searching network and never connects to internet(except default operator)\nI need explanation wether if its locked for ubuntu or not?\nand if not whats the problem?\n\nA: 3G sticks are by and large designed only to be used on a particular network operator. When you got it from Idea, only connections with Idea 3G data plan enabled will work. It is not a Ubuntu thing. The problem is that Ubuntu might detect the card, but configuring it for use is a different matter.\n\nA: I think the stick is locked. It is easily possible to unlock the stick with the software for Windows. I have the same which was locked and is now unlocked. But i don't know if it's illegal to describe the way here so it's the best to search for it on google.\n", "Q: Some Fonts don't appear in LibreOffice I installed some fonts (mingliu.ttc) by putting them in ~/.fonts/\nThe font is visible in other applications (such as Abiword & Firefox). \nBut it does not appear in the font menu of LibreOffice.\nWhen I type the font name manually, the characters display as squares.\nHow can I install the font for LibreOffice?\n\nA: That's weird.  I just tried with the same font (mingliu.ttc) and it worked fine in LibreOffice on Ubuntu 10.10.\nThere might be a problem with your font cache.\nTry running sudo fc-cache -f -v.  This will rebuild the cache.\n\nA: I had similar font problems with LibreOffice Version 4.4.2.2 and lubuntu 15.04.  I checked the permission of the font files in /usr/share/fonts/ folder, changed the permission from 600 to 744, and used the terminal command \"sudo fc-cache -fv\".  It solved my problems, therefore, ownership of the font can be a cause of the problem.\n\nA: My version of libreoffice does not \"see\" True Type Collection (.ttc) fonts. So I had to break open the collection like this:\n1. install Fontforge through the Ubuntu Software app.\n2. right click the .ttc file and open with Fontforge.\n3. you will be asked to choose which of the fonts in the collection you want to choose, pick anyone.\n4. next step select \"Generate fonts\" and in the drop down menu select True Type and save. You wil get a .ttf\n5. start again to convert the other members of the collection and then install them all the normal way and they do appear in libreoffice (as one)\n\nA: I tried some methods, but all do not work for me.\nI finally manually downloaded the fonts and move them to ~/.local/share/fonts/, and sudo fc-cache -f -v to refresh the cache.\n", "Q: Evolution Contacts not Auto-populating I am using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Evolution 2.28.3. I have Evolution configured to use my gmail contacts.\nWhen composing a message, entering addresses does not automatically resolve in any way. In order to use an address from my contacts, I need to click on the To: button and select contacts from the list. The list itself is fine - all my contacts are present.\nIs there any way to have Evolution automatically resolve email addresses as I type? I've looked through the preferences and found nothing helpful.\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it by checking three boxes:\na. Evolution-Mail -> Edit -> Preferences -> Contacts -> [x] Always show address of the autocompleted contact / [x] Gmail\nb. Evolution-Contacts -> Gmail -> Properties -> [x] Autocomplete with this address book\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Change the font color for the Skype panel? So I just installed Skype and I'm using the Ambiance theme that comes with Ubuntu 10.10.\nIt looks like the font color for the text in the Skype panel is the same as the background color for panels in the Ambiance theme.\nIs there any way to change the font color in the panel JUST for Skype? \nI did a:\nfind . -name \"skype\"\nand checked some of the conf files but didn't see anything related to text color.\n\nA: This is a confirmed Skype bug with the Ambiance theme. You can fix this by going into your Skype Options > General > Choose Style and set it to \"Desktop Settings\". I've posted a screenshot.\n\n", "Q: How can I convert an AVI file to a Blackberry-compatible format? I need a program to convert an AVI file to a format compatible with my Blackberry. On Windows, I've tried format factory and converted the .avi file to .3gp, but the output is of very bad quality.\n\nA: You can use Avidemux. It also provides good editing features.\n\n\nWinFF is another option, only for video conversions. As the app site says:\n\nWinFF is a GUI for the command line video converter, FFMPEG. It will convert most any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does multiple files in multiple formats at one time. You can for example convert mpeg's, flv's, and mov's, all into avi's all at once. WinFF is available for Windows 95, 98 , ME, NT, XP, VISTA, and Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat based GNU/Linux distributions.\n\nffmpeg is really powerful but it might be tricky to use for many users. WinFF provides a GUI for it and makes it easier to use.\n\n\nEdit:\nMobile Media Converter is another good option.\nApplication descriptions:\n\nThe Mobile Media Converter is a free video and audio converter for converting between popular desktop media formats like MP3, Windows Media Audio (wma), Ogg Vorbis Audio (ogg), Wave Audio (wav), MPEG video, AVI, Windows Media Video (wmv), Flash Video (flv), QuickTime Video (mov) and commonly used mobile devices/phones formats like AMR audio (amr) and 3GP video. iPod/iPhone and PSP compatible MP4 video are supported. Moreover, you can remove and add new formats or devices through the internet.\nAn integrated YoutTube downloader is available for direct downloading and converting to any of these formats. You can trim your clips for ringtone creation or any other purpose and crop your videos for removing up/down black bars or other unwanted parts of the image. Additionally, embedded subtitles can be encoded onto the video for watching movies or shows with subtitles on devices that does not supports them.\nThe program has a very easy-to-use and simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) that helps even the most amateur user. Most of the times, the only data that you must enter is the input file(s) or just drag 'n' drop the input file(s)! The 3GP and AMR formats are used by mobile phones for MMS, video and sound recordings, etc.\n\n\n\nA: Convert AVI to 3gp using ffmpeg\nffmpeg is an excellent application on video conversion. It supports most of the file formats.\nffmpeg [[infile options][-i infile]]… {[outfile options] outfile}…\n\nConvert from MPG to 3GP\nffmpeg -i inputfile.mpg -s qcif -vcodec h263 -acodec aac -ac 1 -ar 8000 -r 25 -ab 32 -y outputfile.3gp\n\nConvert from AVI to 3GP\nffmpeg -i inputfile.avi -s qcif -vcodec h263 -acodec aac -ac 1 -ar 8000 -r 25 -ab 32 -y outputfile.3gp\n\nConvert from 3GP to AVI\nffmpeg -i clip.3gp -f avi -vcodec xvid -acodec mp3 -ar 22050 file.avi\n\n", "Q: How to partition Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex 2TB hard disk? Hi I bought a new Seagate 2TB external hard disk. I opened the drive's application in my virtual windows, did product registration using the application present in it. I have few questions on how best to use it.\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive by default has some files and folders - setup.exe, System Volume Information, USB 3.0 PC Card Adapter etc,. I copied all the files to my laptop. Is it safe to delete these files? It has a dash board for windows which allows to tune power options, test the drive etc. Will I be able to use the dash board if I put back all these files and mount on windows again?\n\n*I want to partition and format the hard disk. Data I like to store is \n\n*\n\n*Around 10 to 20 GB Files - Virtual box images.\n\n*Around 4GB Files - Dvd images.\n\n*Other Movies and personal Files.\nWhat is the best filesystem to store very huge files like 10 to 20GB files. So that they are written and accessed fast also best uses the drive's capacity. \n\n\n*If I leave one of the partition as ntfs and others to different files systems, will it be able to mount on windows and Will I be able to use the device's dash board?\n\n\nNote: I dont need any encryption for my data.\nAny other advice on using the hard disk is also welcome.\n\nA: First of all, all the stuff provided by the manufacturer of the hard disk drive, is \"for the convenience of the user\", which isn't used by some people because of some of we prefer to use different backup and diagnostic software, other than these provided by the manufacturer, and some other tools are facing the same situation.\nFor the diagnostic tools provided inside of the disk, I suggest you to perform a test running the software from a different location and let's see if the hard disk drive is found by the program. This way you can be sure that the hard disk drive will be handled by the programs in order to diagnose it when you put the files back into the disk. BTW: These tools will probably give you a better performance when used in a MS based system (Windows).\nWell, it is a hard drive. With this in mind, let's take in consideration that the majority of the Operating systems will be able to reach the data contained on it. Nevertheless, the file system that you use will provide a better performance just if the OS is able to handle the allocation sectors with ease, which will be defined at the time that you create the partitions.\nI mean: no matters what you put in the disk, if the OS that you use can understand the partitions table that you make, the data will be available.\nIn linux you can access the majority of the File Systems that are even created by other OS's, nonetheless, other OS's may not understand all the partitions created by Linux (in example: windows will have problems to natively read ext4 file systems)\nAbout the partitions, In my experience I can tell you that partitioning provides an eye-candy solution for the user, which is just an optical illusion. If you make several partitions, you are forcing the heads to run from an allocation data sector to the MBR and back to a different allocation data sector, which won't provide a better performance than using a single partition. People may differ with me in this point but this is what I have experienced. Hard disk drives with several partitions burned because of overheat, situation that isn't faced by single partition HDD's.\nFor large files (10 up to 20 GB), I use NTFS. FAT may won't be able to store these files. And I haven't tested on ext4 FS.\nAbout your last point: I have read that there are reports of people that says that Windows 7 doesn't read FAT file systems, you better gather enough information about it before making this kind of FS.\nAnd good luck.\n\nA: I ALWAYS partition my windows systems with at least 3 partitions. A cdrv containing all operating system stuff. A ddrv containing all user-installed software. And a edrv for general storage and BLOBs.\nEven on old DOS systems, this schema provides exceptional control of software and provides great security (hackers usually hit your cdrv). With win98, I could actually capture the cdrv to floppies and could install the system back to the hard drive with the help of a couple of small utilities (long file names and such needed special attention.)\nWith Dixml, I easily captured my XP systems (cdrv) in two files with the ability to copy XP to another partition or hard drive.\nWith relatively small amount of effort, I have gone thru several crashes where these techniques payed off in gold (time).\nmakpiya\n\nA: I disagree with you on the partition fact you say for the reason is that if a user partitions a drive say into three drive instead of one, then the dive stays within that drive if say the user puts music on one drive, movies on another and writtings on the other. when a user is using the drive they are usually doing one thing at a time with the drive and not jumping from one thing to the other. There for the drive works within a more confined area on the dics. Especially if that drive is a external Drive. Think of it as having three albums on one album disc. If you usually play the same album the drive only has to move within a third of the space.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu need to reboot so often? Ubuntu seems to require a reboot after almost every apt update, even those that do not include a new kernel version. Why?\n\nA: It's worth saying that Linux also needs rebooted after other package updates too.\nI'm a big Ubuntu fan but the frequency of package updates (because it's so bleeding edge) is far higher than other distributions.\nThe extent of which has meant I've dropped Ubuntu on some Servers in favour of Debian.\nIf anyone else can add to this list of packages that need a reboot it would be appreciated.\nI use the superb checkrestart from debian-goodies (it uses lsof) to check when older libraries are still in use.\nUpdating these packages force a reboot:\nKernel packages (not all, like the meta packages)\nlibc\ndbus\nI'm only really concerned with Ubuntu Server and not the Desktop because only rebooting my Servers gives me a headache!\n\nA: If you don't want to, here is a solution for desktop Linux use: http://www.ksplice.com\n\nA: I guess you are referring to the latest update.\nIt included a package called linux-firmware which is a package that provides firmware used by the Linux kernel drivers so it was a kernel related update.\nSo to answer your question or better to correct that statement, Ubuntu doesn't need to be restarted on every update but just on updates which are related to kernel stuff.\n\nA: I'm not sure of all the packages that require a reboot to finish the upgrade, but it is easy to find out why in specific cases.\nThe warning is triggered by a postinst script in the package. It creates the file /var/run/reboot-required The file /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs will list the packages that require the reboot.\n\nA: Perhaps is due to this.\nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/Private-Open-Source-Software-Security-Mailing-List-Shuts-Down-After-Hacking-188103.shtml\n", "Q: How to avoid \"Assuming drive cache: write through\" message during restart? Does anyone know how to avoid getting this message:\nAssuming drive cache: write through\n\nWhich is showing up after performing sudo shutdown -r now.  \nI restarted remotely but the computer did not restart. And I can't restore my remote connection to it. I want to be sure that it won't happen again. When I physically approached the computer and turned on the display, I found 3 lines saying:\nAssuming drive cache: write through\n\nAll those messages were because of my sdd disk. Later I checked and found that sdd is my external USB 1TB disk.\nAny ideas on how to prevent such situations in future?\n\nA: What does the message: asking for cache data failed, assuming drive cache: write through mean?\nThe Linux block layer makes some assumptions about when writes are actually committed to disk. LSI RAID controller logical drives pretend to be SCSI disks, but the firmware and driver doesn't report whether the controller is in \"write-through\" mode or \"write-back\" mode. Without this information, the block layer assumes \"write-through\". This is safe, because the controller has a battery-backed cache.\nLSI's engineers know that their driver should handle this better so you don't see this message. But it's not an error, and it doesn't affect the system.\n\nA: Stumbled onto a flint-axe type fix -- since this occurs before and after login, started looking for mechanisms that could do that, and thought it might be sent to stdio by dmesg.\nUsing sudo dmesg -n 1 turned off the messages. It may be possible to automate that in grub. But seems like treating the symptom, not the disease.\n", "Q: Grep, ignore warnings I am trying to find the installation directory of a particular package. I have a certain keyword using which I am trying to find a particular file.\nDuring grep, I only want to include cpp or h file type. I do not want the grep to show warnings like Permission Denied or  Could not find the Directory.\nI just want it to display matched files, nothing else. Please suggest how can I do this?\nAt present I am using\ngrep \"My term\" -ir --exclude-dir=\"\\.svn\" --include=*.{cpp,h} ./\n\n\nA: Those warnings are directed to the stderr stream, as opposed to the standard out file descriptor.  You can silence the stderr output by adding 2>/dev/null to the end of your command.\n\nA: I used to get a ton of annoying messages like this:\ngrep: commands: Is a directory\ngrep: events: Is a directory\ngrep: views: Is a directory\n\nThe reason is that the --directories flag is defaulted to read. I changed it to recurse; if you don't want it to automatically do a recursive search you can use skip instead.\nThe easiest way to handle this all the time is to set it in an environment variable. In ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc depending on your distro:\nexport GREP_OPTIONS='--directories=recurse'\n\nNow it automatically suppresses those messages any time I use grep.\nAnother option is the --no-messages flag, shorthand -s. This will also get rid of the Is a directory messages, but it also suppresses other messages which might be more useful. For example, if you're doing a nested search in */*/* and no such file of that pattern exists, it won't tell you that.\n\nA: More directly than filtering the warnings you can disable them by adding -s:\ngrep \"My term\" -sir --exclude-dir=\"\\.svn\" --include=*.{cpp,h} ./\n\nThere are some compatibility issues with this option. However, this shouldn't be a problem for personal use.\n\n-s, --no-messages:\n                Suppress  error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.  Portability note: unlike GNU grep, 7th Edition Unix grep did\n  not conform to POSIX, because it\n                lacked -q and its -s option behaved like GNU grep's -q option.  USG-style grep also lacked -q but its -s option behaved like\n  GNU grep.  Portable shell scripts\n                should avoid both -q and -s and should redirect standard and error output to /dev/null instead.  (-s is specified by POSIX.)\n\n\nA: Alternative approach instead of doing grep recursively with -ir  would be to let find command (which is recursive by default) handle the permissions with -readable flag and path's to exclude  with -not -path \"*.svn*\" flags, and then pass the file to grep. Excluding directories is done via -type f for finding only regular files.\n$ find . -not -path \"*.svn*\" -type f -name \"*.cpp\" -or -name \"*.h\"  -readable -exec grep \"my terms\" \"{}\" \\; \n\n\nA: When doing recursive searches in specific files, you are much better off using ack-grep. The syntax here would be:\nack-grep -i \"My term\" --cpp --h\n\nTo remove the permission error messages, you may want to run the same command with sudo:\nack-grep -i \"My term\" --cpp --h\n\nBut eventually, if you want to search installed packages, look at those various options: https://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu%20search%20inside%20installed%20packages\n", "Q: How to detect another sudo process? Whenever a command is \"unable to lock the administration directory\", is there any way to easily detect what process is running that is using sudo?\n\nA: in a terimnal, enter top command. you can see the list of processes and the second column is the user that is running the process. check that column for root. Also you can filter the processes with respect to the user running them. To show all processes being run by root, enter top -u root.\n", "Q: Gnome menu with mouse up to the top I am just starting with Linux. I have noticed that though Gnome has a fixed menu (Gnome panel) at the top of the screen, similarly to Mac OS X, it is impossible to click a menu item after moving the mouse all the way up, to the very edge of the screen. It looks as if there is a one pixel border between the menu and the screen top edge. Is it possible to remove it?\n\nA: Resolved. The problem (or, rather, the reason) was that I had enabled Windows 7-like window maximize feature (maximize window by dragging it to the top of the screen), as explained here. Having switched it off, I can now use the Gnome menu with the mouse all the way up and left.\n", "Q: How can I use apt-get to list all packages written in C? Is there any way I can use apt-get to give me a list of all packages written in C, or that have C modules in them?\n\nA: The debtags  package could be useful for this. \ndebtags search devel::lang:c\nThis will list all packages which have been tagged as written in C.\napt-cache rdepends libc6 will show you all packages that depend on libc6.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change how Update Manager displays the updates? Is it possible to change the way how Update Manager displays the updates currently available?\nCurrently (in Maverick 10.10) the packages are shown with their description in a larger font, and their package name (and size) in smaller font.\nI would prefer having the other way round: read easily what's the package name in question, and if I don't recognize what is it, read in smaller text what that package does.\n\nA: Maybe you can:\n1) alt+f2 and gconf-editor\n2) Edit → Find: update-manager\nThen changes sone option e.g. show_details, show_version,    \n", "Q: Surround Sound and Video Setup Ok.

The migration from a Microsoft based system to the freedom can be a little bit irritating.\nFirst of all, I can't give a suggestion for a really complex situation like that you are facing which seems to be a lot of work to be done and you may feel disappointed.\nMy suggestion for you: Give a chance to a distribution with pre-loaded software, in which you may perform several tests and find a way to learn how the things works inside of an Ubuntu system.\nThere are several pre-loaded systems that you can find in Distrowatch, of which I strongly suggest you the Israel Remix Team distro, in which you will find the support from the creator of this distro who is a very experienced man in which refers to Linux systems.\nThere are several distributions ready for multi-media (audio, graphics and video), office, programming and several other tasks.\nRun a live session, from which you can check the pre-installed programs and their behavior on your system.\nWith the usage of these pre-installed distributions you may learn the way you did in your pre-installed Window$. Unless you started learning to make and program your windows from scratch, which I doubt a lot.\nBTW: Israel Remix Team is pre-loaded with lots of software for the multi-media (audio, images and video creation/edition), programming tools, apache server, php, TV Players, Media players, and lots of useful stuff.\nYou may wish to check also the Ubuntu Studio distro, which is designed mostly for the multi-media purposes (audio, images and video creation/edition).\n\nA: Have you configured your sound card to run in 5.1 mode in the Sound Preferences control panel?  You should be able to configure this from the Hardware tab:\n\nBy default this would probably be set to stereo, since many cards support multiple speaker configurations without a good way of telling the OS what configuration has been plugged in.\nAfter setting the hardware profile, you can easily test it from within this control panel.  With this change, you should find that stereo output is sent to both front and rear speakers in addition to supporting surround sound output.\n", "Q: Stuck on GRUB Command Line I am running Natty Alpha 3.

Inspired by the old Hacker News conversation about this webiste, I'm wondering:\nCould Ubuntu and Mono run an ASP.NET MVC website like Ask Ubuntu?\nThe technology is the focus here instead of the site. Could you replace IIS, ASP.NET, MVC, etc with free and open source technologies without having to completely redevelop the site?\n\nNote from Oli: The meta-discussion (that is: will Ask Ubuntu migrate to Ubuntu+Mono?) has been moved to a separate question in the meta portion of the website\n\n\nA: I don't have the codebase for Ask Ubuntu so I can't really say if there's anything particularly platform specific that would cause a blocker but in answer to can you migrate it, the answer is probably yes.\nYou have to keep in mind that the platform that ASP.NET websites sit on are more than a magical ASP.NET binary:\n\n\n*\n\n*ASP.NET can largely be replaced by Mono. It's not always pretty and the performance isn't always great but it can be done.\n\n*ASP.NET MVC is the templating engine. It normally sits on top of ASP.NET but it can run on Mono with a few changes.\n\n*IIS could be removed fairly simply, allowing for custom handlers that SO have running on it, replacing it with Apache (et al).\n\n*The database is technically the biggest part of the whole. In simple cases, where you're using good code, sure. Rip out the database and replace it. Specifically for here, the cluster arrangement of MSSQL servers that runs the StackExchange sites could probably be ported to MySQL (or other) but it would probably need significant work as there's probably a fair portion of DB-specific code lurking around, either in the database itself or (less likely) in the site itself. Most code-based, database-specific data-faffing is a thing of the past thanks to LINQ, which Mono does support (for non-SQL Server databases too).\nThat's by no means a definitive list of what would be replaced but they're the major items.\nWhether or not you'd want to... That's a tougher question. By the time you'd hunted through a few dozen issues, you're probably already at the point where you could have just reimplemented the system in something like Django. Of course that depends on the complexity of the system. It's as hard as a piece of string.\n", "Q: Google desktop logo looks bad The Google Desktop icon in the system tray in Unity looks ugly:\n\nAny way around this?\n\nA: I had this issue too, but fpoehler ( http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=1174921 ) solved it here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1466473&page=4 .\n\"\nThe themes that work should be the ones which have the same panel background as normal application windows.

How do I get it to work?\n\nA: I am the person who developed zeitgeist-datasource-tomboy.

I know how to disable it, circumvent it, and that it saves stuff. However, when asked \"what is it for, why is it there, and how does it work\" I'm at a loss for words. What's more disturbing is there doesn't seem to be much of anything content-wise for those questions on the internet.\nSo once and for all. What is a Keyring, why is it on my computer, and how does it work?\n\nA: A keyring is a \"stored database\" -- I'm using this term lightly -- of your login information stored on your local PC. It's wrapped by some magic voodoo encryption schema (PKCS#11 - this is used for secure storage on removable media) so it's going to be relatively secure from prying eyes.\nIt provides a common backend for (insert framework here, we will use gnome for an example) to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) your login information without \"rolling your own solution\". It keeps a consistent interface for programmers utilizing that particular framework. KDE provides its own keyring, Gnome has another implementation of it. \nEvolution, Firefox, Net-man all utilize this interface. When you place your email server credentials into Evolution it asks you to store that information in the keyring. If you opt into it, it passes the data off to the keyring service and voilà, it's stored. Evolution only has to subsequently call the keyring service on startup to retrieve that information.\nThe big idea here is that if someone else were to access your PC and did not know the master password to your keyring, they could not access your stored login information. The same principle is put to use by lastpass.com's addon for your browser. (only it's distributed, meaning I can use it on several instances of browsers across PC's) \nIn summary, I offer this snippet from the gnome-keyring page located here\n\nGNOME Keyring is a collection of components in GNOME that store\n  secrets, passwords, keys, certificates and make them available to\n  applications.\nGNOME Keyring is integrated with the user's login, so that their\n  secret storage can be unlocked when the user logins into their\n  session.\nGNOME Keyring is based around a standard called PKCS#11, which is a\n  standard way for applications to manage certificates and keys on smart\n  cards or secure storage.\n\n", "Q: How to fix the Google desktop logo in the notification area?

I'll give you instructions on how to install it.\nYou can install LAMP (Stack of Apache, PHP and MySQl) by running this terminal command on the server:\nsudo tasksel install lamp-server\n\nThen, after that you can install WordPress by running this command:\nsudo apt-get install wordpress\n\nThen you can fire up WordPress by entering the ip address of the server in the window of a client browser. For example, if the server IP address on the LAN is 10.25.43.25, then enter 10.25.43.25 in the browser of any desktop attached to the LAN. You'll get the WordPress install page. Follow the instructions here to install WordPress.\nDrupal is another popular CMS. You can install it by running:\nsudo apt-get install drupal6\n\nUbuntu has version 6 of drupal. The latest is version 7. You can install drupal 7 by following this guide.\n\nA: On the server you will be needing Apache with php and mysql as a base. From this there are many CMS that will help you build your site. As mentioned WordPress is great for blogs as it also has apps on various mobile platforms.\nMy preference for building full websites is Joomla, but there is also Drupal, Concrete5, Mambo and probably many more smaller platforms. \nWhichever platform you decide, you won't need any html knowledge (unless you want to learn) as the platform will take care of your template, content, menu structure, widgets, etc  \n\nA: If you want a blog site install the CMS, Content Management System, Wordpress. There are many templates available which will give you your basic site structure. There are a number of books on Wordpress and you will find wordpress.com helpful.

Using a simple Linksys WRT54GS as a 5 port switch (ignore wireless and isp) -- how do I maximize the transfer rates between the computers?\nPlease Note: I'm not interested in load balancing -- Correct me if I'm wrong, but I want to bond the two channels together so that the box appears as if it has one connection that's twice as fast.\n\nA: Its important to note that in order to utilize NIC teaming functionality the switch you're connected through must support teaming aka LACP. You can find a switch like that through a search on NewEgg.com etc.\nOnce you have that here is a simple guide from the wiki:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBonding\nGood luck!\n\nA: I would think going through a switch would limit any benefit you would get from using 2 Ethernet cables in parallel.  Unless the switch is faster than your two NICs combined, in which case then you might see a speed increase.  \nLoad Balancing program is what you are looking for.  You don't have to \"load balance\" if you don't want to, but it is the easiest way to merge the connections I know of. The Idea is not too complicated\nVirtual NIC - > Load Balancing Program -> NIC 1 + 2\nThis answer has what you are looking for I believe:\nNetwork load-balancing with Network Manager\nI'm not sure on the specifics but I'm sure that is the general idea.\nUnless the NIC cards are substantially less powerful than your router/switch the only benefit you will probably get is with a direct connection between the two computers, Or a parallel connection the whole way.  But theory and practice don't always work out.\nThe only way I can think of to test if the NIC is the bottleneck in your system is to do a speed test between each computer using all 4 NICs.  I can give you the general Idea on how to do this but the Ubuntu specific stuff I'll need a hand with.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set each NIC to have its own IP address like 192.168.0.1 + 192.168.0.2 for computer 1 and *.3 + *.4 for computer 2  \n\n*The only speed test for local networks I've seen is just transfer time on a bit file.  I'm not sure if there is a better method, I've never seen one.\n3  Set routes manually so *.1 is the interface to get to *.3 and *.2 get to *.4.\nPC1 192.168.0.1 <--> 192.168.0.3 PC2\n192.168.0.2 <--> 192.168.0.4\nI've never used ip tables so here is something I found as an example.  \n[root]# ip route add xx.xxx.239.120 via xx.xxx.239.120 dev eth0 table 4\n[root]# ip route add table 4 default via xx.xxx.239.120 \n[root]# iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -s xx.xxx.239.120 -j MARK --set-mark 4 \n[root]# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source xx.xxx.239.120 [root]# ip rule add fwmark 4 table 4\n\n\n\n*another option is to find a way for ssh (or terminal) client to connect via certain interfaces.  I'm not sure how thats done yet for the client side.\n\n\nIf IP tables is set up correctly you should be able to send 2 files from PC 1 to both interfaces on PC 2 and each file will take a different route.  If the transfer with the two connections is faster than just one.. (hopefully twice as fast) then you might have something.\n\nA: I don't think you said whether or not you were using a Gigabit NIC, I am guessing you are since you have 2 NICs and therefore probably a gaming motherboard. \nSince that is the case, if you are trying to get 2x100 base then you are better off buying a cheap 4-8 port Gigabit switch and plugging it into your Internet router. Then you can plug all the computers that run Ethernet into that switch and still have working wifi and Internet on all your computers. \nI do that now because I bought a Netgear WNDR3400 and put DD-WRT on it so that I could have a few nice options including a very up to date NAS server built in.  \nThe only problem was that the router was 100 base on the Ethernet ports.  So for $40 I bought a 5 port Gigabit switch plugged it into my router then plugged all my computers into the Gigabit switch and plugged my gaming consoles into the router. \nEverything works great and I can transfer files between the computers at lightning speeds.\nWell good luck!\n\nA: It's very unlikely that bonding your interfaces will result in a speed increase.  Typically, even if you bond the interfaces successfully AND configure the switch to support the etherchannel), then you will still find that only one interface in the bond is used for each pair of source/destination TCP/UDP session.\nSo if you copy a 10Gb file from one server, then kick off another 10Gb copy to that server, assuming that you also have session based bonding, you'll see both cards maxed out.  But crucially, the first copy will only consume ONE network card, not both.\nThis is certainly the case with Cisco's etherchannel.  In fact, Cisco's etherchannel isn't even session based, it's source/destination based, so in my example above, you wouldn't even get a speed increase - your second copy would have to be to a completely different server before you saw both cards used.  Perhaps you have a better switch that allows for the port channel to utilise both cards simultaneously in one TCP/UDP session but it would require some pretty funky arp/MAC manipulation and I have no idea if the bonding module in linux supports that.\nAs for you, you're using a bog-standard home router, so switch-side support is out of the question here, meaning that your options are further limited (see the first article lined to below, where you will note that you now cannot use the best mode for link aggregation, mode 4).\nIf you're determined to go ahead with this, I found this five year old article which still seems relevant.  Additionally, this three year old article covers the same ground.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: There is a library called firehose which can transfer data over multiple network devices simultanteously. It doesn't give you a single virtual network device though, and it doesn't support TCP. It's designed for high bandwidth video streaming for video editors. Could be interesting to you though:\nhttp://heroinewarrior.com/firehose.php\n\nA: I was faced similar situation and found this:\nhttp://ubuntulinuxhelp.com/how-to-use-the-second-network-port-on-your-computer/\nBut its somewhat old, Hope it helps. \n\nA: Using Port Bonding and Round-Robin policy on both devices connected through an un-managed switch will in fact nearly double your transfer rate. Round-Robin policy defaults to load balancing over multiple devices and falls back to single-port if one device fails.\nHowever, I believe your WRT54GS is a router and therefore managed so you won't get the full benefit from the bonding. \nAssuming you were to use a cheap 8-port true switch that supported RR policy and then connect it to the router, you would get increased transfer speeds between the two devices using bonding through the switch and normal transfer speeds to the internet and rest of the network.\nYou should also increase your read/write buffers, txqeueuelen and your netcore and tcp memory.\n", "Q: Evolution Calendar Sync with UbuntuOne?

How do I fix this?\n\nA: I always start with the effortless \"apt-get clean\" to remove downloaded package files when I need more disk space.\n\nA: Check what's the disk usage with \ndf -k\n\nand \ndf -i\n\nThe first command will tell you how much diskspace (in terms of kilobytes) is available\nand the second one will do the counting for inodes . If you have a huge number of small files the partition may have still free diskspace, but run out of inodes (which if you don't know about them, you can see like 'slots' in a parking space)\nOk, so if you effectively are running out of inodes, the only way to fix it is to reformat the partition using different parameters. If you cannot do that, you can try to mitigate the problem by moving part of the 'inode-hungry' section of data to a different partition. \nStarting from /home top level, you can run this simple script (apologies if it's not 100% fool-proof ;-) )\nfor dir in *; do [ -d \"$dir\" ] && echo \"$dir\" && find \"$dir\" | wc -l; done\n\nIt should count for each subdirectory how many inodes are used (in short, each file or directory present).\nYou can repeat the procedure going down a few levels if you want.\nAnyway, once you identify the directory that consumes most of the inodes, you can move it to somewhere else, and leave inside /home a symlink to the new location.\nShorter that that, your only chance is to archive (with tar, zip or similar tools) the part of data in /home directory that you are not currently using (and remove the loose files). This will bring the inodes count down, but at the cost of continuously archiving/unarchiving pieces of the storage.   \n", "Q: Split a text file into two files, without losing revision history?

Are there still general problems using the Ubuntu 64bit version ?\nI heard that most of the programs do not work out of the box?\nWill I notice a significant speed-boost? Until now I have always used Ubuntu 32 bit.\n\nA: \nI heard that most of the programms, does not work out of the box ?\n\nNo this is silly. Everything works for me — and has for many years — on more than one computer.\nThe two things that have been an issue in the past are Java (works completely fine now) and Flash (now has a native plugin and while that doesn't get as much love from Adobe as its 32bit version, still does the job just fine).\n\nWill I notice a significant speed-boost ?\n\nSignificant? Probably not significant but notable. You'd get a much better speed improvement by say switching to an SSD or doing a general upgrade.\nI'd still say if you've got less than 3GB of RAM (and you won't upgrade to 4 or more), stick with 32bit. 64bit does use more RAM so if you're already squeezed, that won't help. \nIf you do have 4 or more, this should be a no-brainer. 64bit works. There probably are some very insignificant issues but I don't think I've found anything that has actually stopped me.\n\nA: I've not seen anything go wrong with 64bit since 10.10, but I still use 32bit on the desktop due to the amount of RAM I have (3GB).  All of our servers are running Ubuntu Server 64bit with absolutely no problems.\n\nA: All programs work well, right out of the box. Just like Oli said, if you have 3GB RAM or less, then stick to 32-bit. 64-bit uses more RAM, and if you have high RAM, say, 4GB or more, then 64-bit is the way to go.\nAs I said, all programs work well on 64-bit. The only program which has minor issues on 64-bit systems is Adobe Flash. Adobe only provides a 32-bit version of flash. You can run the 32-bit version of flash on 64-bit. It runs well, but a bit slower than on a native 32-bit system. A 64-bit version of Flash, called Flash 'Square' is currently in development. You can download it from here. I use Flash Square myself, and it works really well. Haven't noticed any issues yet.\n\nA: I can vouch that on Server hardware and on Desktop hardware 64-bit has worked fine for me for ages.\n\nA: 64bit works great if you're using more than 3 GB of RAM. This is what I have done: I have one partition running 10.04, some programs work only for 32bit 10.04 like portable apps; and on another partition, I have 64bit 10.10, almost all apps work with 64bit so that's what I would do to run both.\n\nA: 32 Bit will use less memory than 64 bit.  It depends on the application, but it is worth considering if you have a small memory system.  Here are some 32 vs 64 bit comparisons:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/x32/Quantal-x32-power-memory-comparisons.ods\n\nA: Everything out of the box. \nI use Maverick 64 for CAD rendering and 2D technical and artistic drawings.\nAres Commander / Blender / Photivo / Darktable / GIMP / Raw Therapee / Fotoxx - all out of the box. \n32 bits apps. will work also well if you install ia32 library.\nFlash Square will not work in Firefox 4 which has a plugin loader for 32bits not for 64 so Flash Square is working actually in Chrome and Opera.\n\nA: All programs works right in my Ubuntu x64, but skype sometimes freezes in time and stops working.\n\nA: Something that I've experienced even nowdays with the ubuntu x64\nis the games some of the games on the ubuntu center doesn't work correctly on x64\nand the rest of the software nowdays works fine the proble of the x64 compatibillity was just in the past not nowdays.\n", "Q: Using recursion with a command loop.

I installed a ppc port of Ubuntu 10.10 on my rather old eMac (G4, 1.25 GHz). So far i have a good impression so far, but the graphics don't seem to be really supported out of the box although there is a driver preinstalled i guess.\nIs there a way i can accelerate my Radeon 9200? When i move a window it has a trace and things get slow when there are other windows running in the background. Besides i can get no fancy but useful effects like dropshadows and transparency. Not very sexy :(\n\nA: ATI dropped support for that video card years ago, leaving the open source driver as the only option for older ATI hardware. If you really get that bad performance with the default Ubuntu driver, you might want to try the latest xorg (the basis of displaying graphical stuff in Linux, including drivers) from this package repository. The software is not stable though, so there's always the chance it doesn't work at all and gives you a black screen. And I have no idea if they provide packages for PPC, but you can try.\nSo if you're willing to risk it you can try the driver by typing the following commands in terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal):\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen reboot and hope for the best.\nIf things go wrong but you still have a somehow usable system, you can revert back to the safe driver with:\nsudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: You can first read these instructions\nIf you say the \"Additional Drivers\" list is empty, maybe your card is unsupported?  They provide a link to this AMD website where you can check that.  If it is supported, you might try installing fglrx in the terminal like so:\n$ sudo aptitude update\n$ sudo aptitude install fglrx\n\nThen the command fglrxinfo tells you if it worked.\n\nA: As user13178 says, that card is no longer supported by ATI/AMD. Plus, the ppc ubuntu port is community supported, and you are unlikely to find working drivers. I suggest getting a modern system ;).\n\nA: As user13178 says, that card is no longer supported by ATI/AMD.

I have my passwords secure, but I heard people complaining about perfomance of a server going down drastically when a bruteforce attack is taking place. How can I secure my ubuntu 10.10 server from such attacks? Is there an apparmor profile for this? Or some other way to address it?\n\nA: I get brute-force ssh attacks on my servers with a rate of 1 to 2 per day. I have installed denyhosts (ubuntu package: denyhosts). It's a very simple but effective tool for that purpose: essentially it periodically scans your logs to detect brute-force attacks and puts IPs from where these attacks originate into your /etc/hosts.deny file. You won't hear from them again and your load should be reduced considerably. It is very configurable via its config file /etc/denyhosts.conf to tweak issues like how many wrong attempts consitute an attack etc. \nDue to its transparent workings you can easily see what's going on (email notification: 'aha, another dastardly attack thwarted!') and undo mistakes due to your users mistyping their passwords repeatedly .\nOf course, everything previously said about switching to other authentication methods holds but sometimes your requirements disagree with those of your users.\nAlso, new-connection rate limiting in iptables might be a better choice then denying access via hosts.deny. So, have a look at fail2ban as well. But if you know that ssh brute-force is your main concern (manually look through /var/log/auth.log to determine this), go with this very easy and low impact tool.\n\nA: *\n\n*Change the sshd port to something nonstandard\n\n*Use knockd to implement a port-knocking system\n\n*Use iptables' recent and hashlimit matches to limit consecutive SSH attempts\n\n*Do not use passwords, but use SSH keys instead\n\n\nA: First of all you should consider not using passwords and use keys instead. There is no need to use a password. If this works for you, you can configure the OpenSSH-server not to react on password logins.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html\nUsing fail2ban, could be an option as well.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fail2ban\n\nA: There are different solutions. The best one is using RSA authentication that uses public/private keys to authenticate users.\nCheck this great manual for different approaches (RSA authentication included): http://www.la-samhna.de/library/brutessh.html\nI'm using the 3rd solution on my server because I don't want to make it complicated for my non-technical users: using iptables to limit the number of connections per minute that makes bruteforce attacks inefficient and ineffective.\nHere is the solution I'm using:\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --rttl --name SSH -j LOG --log-prefix \"SSH_brute_force \"\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --rttl --name SSH -j DROP\n\nAs mentioned here: this will allow three port 22 connections from any given IP address within a 60 second period, and require 60 seconds of no subsequent connection attempts before it will resume allowing connections again. The --rttl option also takes into account the TTL of the datagram when matching packets, so as to endeavour to mitigate against spoofed source addresses. \nAs stated in the mentioned guide, it's better to use a white list to separate trusted users from these rules:\niptables -N SSH_WHITELIST\n\nthen add trusted hosts:\niptables -A SSH_WHITELIST -s $TRUSTED_HOST -m recent --remove --name SSH -j ACCEPT\n\nand after that make the rules:\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j SSH_WHITELIST\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --rttl --name SSH -j ULOG --ulog-prefix SSH_brute_force\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --rttl --name SSH -j DROP\n\n\nA: How widely is the server exposed on the network?\nPerhaps you can have a talk with the network admin and check if it's possible to monitor and restrict network access to the server.\nEven if the account logins are safe, it seems that the server could suffer from simple DoS / DDoS attack.\n\nA: An alternative to fail2ban is CSF: ConfigServer Security & Firewall.\nIt comes with LFD: a Login Failure Daemon that can detect multiple failed login attempts on various services, and will block the offending IP address (temporarily or permanently).\nIt has some other options that can help against flood attacks, and possibly detect intrusions.\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must use CSF as your firewall in order for LFD to do its job.  So if you have an existing firewall, you will need to replace it with CSF, and port your configuration over.\n\n*It is not packaged for Ubuntu.  You will have to trust the auto-updates from configserver.com, or disable automatic updates.\n\n*I have heard it is quite popular, so smart intruders will probably know how to disable intrusion detection before they are detected!\n\n\nA: Do you intend to allow SSH service to the world?  Or just to team members at particular places?  My answer depends a bit on the severity of your challenge.\nIn either case, one thing you should do is make sure that the SSH server does not allow password logins for the root user.\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/ssh/sshd_config make sure you never allow a root login except with an SSH key.  \n\n\nIn my systems, I've got this setting\nPermitRootLogin without-password\n\nbut I notice in newer Ubuntu they have\nPermitRootLogin prohibit-password\n\nIf you read \"man sshd_config\" I think it means this newer \"prohibit-password\" means same thing and is certainly more obvious in meaning.  That is NOT default on some Linux systems, but probably should be.\nNow, about your problem.  Does your system server only some users in particular places? Do this!\n\n\n*edit /etc/hosts.deny and insert \nALL: ALL\nThen edit /etc/hosts.allow and list IP numbers or a range that want to allow to use SSH. The notation there is a little confusing because if you want to allow all systems with IP numbers like 111.222.65.101 through 111.222.65.255, you put in an entry like this in hosts.allow\nALL: 127.0.0.1\nsshd: 111.222.65.\nsshdfwd-X11: 111.222.65.\n\nThat is a bruteforce, powerful solution. If your users can be enumerated by IP range, do it!\nThis solution existed before IP tables was created, it is (I think) a lot easier to administer, but it is not as good as an IP tables solution because IP tables routines will spot enemies sooner than the programs driven by hosts.allow and hosts.deny.  But this is a sure fire, simple way to close out a lot of problems, not just from SSH.\nNote the problem you create for yourself. If you want to open up an FTP server, web server, or whatnot, you will have to make entries in hosts allow.\nYou can achieve same basic purpose by fiddling with iptables and the firewall.  In a sense, this is a preferred solution because you are blocking enemies at the outer boundary. Ubuntu has \"ufw\" (uncomplicated firewall) and \"man ufw\" has plenty of examples.\nI'd rather have a nice GUI to wade through this, I don't have to do this all the time. Maybe others can tell us if there is one now. \n\n\n*Other posts here suggested using SSH public key only for your users.  That will certainly help, at the price of complexity and frustration for your users.  In our lab, there are 15 computers. Users go among computers. Requiring SSH key authentication would cause a big hassle because people go from one computer to the next.\n\n\nAnother source of frustration will happen when some users accumulate different ssh keys for various servers.  Because I have SSH keys for about 12 different projects, now ssh fails because I have too many public keys (Requiring either \"ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=false\" or creation of an entry in the .ssh/config file. It is a PITA)  \n\n\n*If you must leave the server open to SSH from the big wide world, then definitely you should use a rejection routine to block locations that frequently try to log in. There are 2 nice programs for this,  the ones we have used are denyhosts and fail2ban. These programs have settings that allow you to ban offenders, for a duration you like.\n\n\nIn our Centos Linux systems, I noticed they dropped the denyhosts package and only offer fail2ban. I liked denyhosts because it built up a list of troublesome users/ip ranges and then in hosts.deny, that list was noted.  We installed fail2ban instead and it is OK. My understanding is that you'd rather block these bad users at the outer edge of the server, so the ip tables based blockers, like fail2ban, are actually better.  Denyhosts works on the secondary level, after enemies have gotten past iptables they are then rejected by the sshd daemon.  \nIn both of these programs, it is a bit tedious to get users out of jail if they forget their password and try a few times to log in.  It is a bit difficult to get people back in when they make login mistakes. You'd have guessed there would be a point-and-click GUI where you could just point and let people back in, but it is not that way.

But ubuntu wiki says:\n\nIn the case of the liveCD, a working network connection is required, since the PAE enabled kernel packages are not present on the CD. \n\nSo I guess you installed Ubuntu using CD without an internet connection.\nTry this:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae\n\nWhat is PAE?\nPhysical Address Extension is a technology which allows 32 bit operating systems to use up to 64 Gb of memory (RAM), something which is normally achieved by switching to a 64 bit system. PAE is supported on the majority of computers today and it is an easy procedure to enable it in Ubuntu, if it is not already. To check if your processor supports PAE, try \ngrep --color=always -i PAE /proc/cpuinfo\nIn general, a proper 64 bit system is recommended if you have 4 Gb or more memory and/or want to get the full benefit of the 64 bit architecture (see 32bit_and_64bit), but in some cases making a complete switch to 64 bit is not desirable, and using PAE can be a viable compromise.\nIt should be noted that there is no Virtual Address Extension. i.e. The applications still get the same amount of virtual memory since the Virtual addresses are still 32 bits while the Physical Addresses are of 36 bits. Therefore PAE is not at all equivalent to a 64 bit system. \n\nA: If you installed the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, it won't recognize over 4GB of memory.  You will need to install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu for the system to recognize more than 4GB of memory.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_GB_barrier\n\nNote that the standard now is for the Ubuntu images to build and ship with the PAE enabled kernel which allows the use of more than 4GB RAM on 32-bit systems.  However, this requires the use of a PAE-capable processor in your system.  If your system is sufficiently old, the PAE kernels will not work, and the above restriction of a 4GB memory limit will still stand.\n\nA: Open /var/log/dmesg/dmesg and look for the section near the beginning that looks like this:\n[    0.000000] BIOS-provided physical RAM map:\n[    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009d800 (usable)\n[    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 000000000009d800 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)\n[    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)\n\nPost that section for detailed analysis.  Also look for another line a little further down like this:\n[    0.000000] Memory: 4019820k/4972544k available (5694k kernel code, 798616k absent, 154108k reserved, 2514k data, 944k init)\n\nOften times there are things like video memory taking up space in the 3-4 gb area.  On some systems that memory is simply lost.  On others, it can be remapped, often above the 4gb mark, which you need either the pae or 64bit kernel to access.\n\nA: You have three solutions, two of which have already been suggested:\n\n\n*\n\n*install a 64-bit kernel on your i386 installation; on Debian it's only a matter of installing kernel-image-2.6-amd64-k8 and amd64-libs\n\n*install a 32-bit kernel with PAE activated\n\n*reinstall a complete 64-bit  system\n\n\nA: Rum memtest (\"Test memory\") from the boot menu (or the installation medium) if the first screen reports less than your 4Gb, upgrade (Flash *ROM) your BIOS.\nRun sudo lshw to determine the model of your motherboard, then head up to vendor's site and DL tje latest BIOS.\n\nA: I know this is a bit too localised, but the dedicated question was marked as duplicated and now redirects to this one.\nFor Dell XPS 13 L321X users, there is a BIOS update that introduced this issue/feature. So if you want to retrieve your 4G of RAM, you need to downgrade to A04 BIOS.\nThere are two topics mentioning this issue on the Dell community:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell XPS 13 3.3GB Available Memory out of 4GB\n\n*XPS 13 Ultrabook - 690 MB Hardware Reserved RAM\n", "Q: Are there any good typing tutors?

When I went back to Ubuntu the wheel scroll was half page jumpy. I unplugged the USB dongle and plugged it back in and all was back to normal.  I'm thinking there are some settings that get set in the mouse itself from the Windows driver.  But the solution above of just reconnecting the mouse works for me.\n\nA: yes, unplug and replug the USB connection. it worked for me. after searching so many times for an answer, and tolerating it so long!\n\nA: Above solutions didn't work for me however...\nThe fix for me for this (I had the problme for months!) was kinda surreal and like most folks I didn't believe it until I did it:\nTurns out some MS mice have a scrollwheel bug.  \n\nTry unplugging the USB cable / dongle then plug back in. \n\nThat's it!\nNow my mouse moves normally (one line at a time, not half a screen!)\nThis worked even though I use a 4-port screen/keyboard/mouse KVM box ! Yeah!\n\nA: GTK dynamically calculates a good value for mouse wheel scroll rate (number of lines to be scrolled) depending on the size of the window. Unfortunately, it does not allow any customization yet and lost of bug reports have been filed about it.\nBy the way, if you are interested in testing what I said, just resize the window to be so small that it displays only one line. Try scrolling and you will see that it scrolls a single line everytime you scroll the wheel.\n\nA: For me, the fix was to clean the inside of the mouse.\nThe proper way to do this is to carefully take it apart and remove hair and dust that had collected near the sensor of the mouse wheel. I just blowed really hard into the gap around the wheel. It worked immediately.\n\nA: I had similar problem with quite new mouse (half year old). During scrolling up, the mouse mixed also some down events. And vice versa.\nI first though the problem is in driver. But the errors was visible also in windows.\nI ended in dismounting the mouse, which was quite clean. But when I blew hard into the wheel encoded component (there is tiny gap on top). Then it started generate events properly.\nSo I propose to everyone, try it on other OS and if it does not work too, then try \"clean\" the encoder even if all around looks clean.\n\nA: I've got pretty much the same problem. When scrolling the wheel very very slowly, it works okay, exactly five lines at the time in gedit. When rolling faster, it jumps forth forth back forth back at random with the effect that you often are at pretty much the same place after scrolling the wheel one turn. In Windows, it works perfect without a driver. It's a Thrust mobile BT mouse.\nI've got a wild guess what's the problem.\nFirst off, this is a wheel with discrete positions on the wheel. This means that the wheel will go fast faster fast faster fast faster when scrolling fast, because the discrete positions function as a break.\nI suggest that the hardware inside the mouse is not good enough to distinguish between back and forth and fast faster fast faster. I know the inner workings of an electronic mouse and it support such an explanation.\nWhen two lights shines through spokes in a photo optic receiver and the latter can only know more or less light and from this have to decide what direction the wheel goes, it can be hard enough to write software for this job when the wheel is turning at the same speed. The explanation why it's not a problem even in Windows generic driver is that MS has had the same problem with their own poor made mouses.\nSolution\nWrite a mode in the driver in which it will turn into when detecting fast changes between back and forth at the mouse wheel. In this mode the driver will discriminate opposite direction from the last one, lets say, in a ring buffer with five last elements.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem.\nSometimes I'd scroll down and the screen would jump up.\nOS: VERSION=\"20.10 (Groovy Gorilla)\"\nMouse: some generic USB wireless mouse\nI tried another generic USB wireless mouse (from a different manufacturer) and the problem was even worse.\nMy up wheel is Button 5 so:\nxev | grep -B 2 \"button 5\"\n\nwhich reliably outputs two events everytime I scroll up one notch.\nE.g.\n--\nButtonPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x7000001,\n    root 0x7a5, subw 0x0, time 126819928, (119,90), root:(264,229),\n    state 0x0, button 5, same_screen YES\n--\nButtonRelease event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x7000001,\n    root 0x7a5, subw 0x0, time 126819928, (119,90), root:(264,229),\n    state 0x1000, button 5, same_screen YES\n\nIt was odd that one mouse was worse than the other. Note that the bad mouse is so bad that sometimes you can be constantly scrolling up and it just keeps jumping around in the middle.\nSo, I then tried another mouse (identical to the first) and that worked perfectly.\nI then tried measuring the battery voltage in the mouse to check if it could have been the signal.\nGood mouse: 1.24V 40%\nMedium mouse: 1.32V 60%\nBad mouse: 1.40V 70%\nSo the battery has nothing to do with the problem.\nI even swapped the battery in the good mouse with the battery in the bad mouse just in case there was a problem with my battery tester but that did not fix things.\nInterestingly, on the bad mouse I found I was getting occasional \"button 4\" events, even when I was scrolling up. E.g. I was seeing many events with:\nxev | grep -B 2 \"button 4\"\n\nI opened up the mouse (not easy as it seems to clip together) and blew on the wheel.\nPutting it back together it was significantly better which points to maybe dust on the scroll wheel. i.e. there was only the very occasional \"button 4\" event when scrolling up which could have been due to some residual dust I missed as I couldn't get into the mouse easily.\nIn summary, with the 3 mice I had, the problem turned out to be the mouse and dust on the wheel rather than Ubuntu. That is, the bad mouse which was struggling to even scroll at all is now working well.\n\nA: Although blowing in the scroll wheel real hard worked for me, I got an alternative I've been using since I'm on Linux which could be useful to anyone that still got this issue: middle-click scroll, like the auto-scroll feature on popular browsers.\nI found a Python script that tries to apply middle scroll ability to every mouse currently connected using xinput and libinput, you can find it here on GitHub.\nBasically, the command is:\nxinput set-prop [MOUSE_ID] \"libinput Scroll Method Enabled\" 0, 0, 1\nwith MOUSE_ID being the ID of your mouse seen in xinput list output.\n", "Q: How to change touchpad behaviour in chromium/firefox?

These days, I have to use the NTFS-3G driver to write to an NTFS drive (which will later be used in Windows). But I still remember the olde times of Linux ntfs driver which clearly said in the docs: 'If you write to an ntfs volume, run our special program afterwards which will clean up the damage done.'\nSo, I read through the man, the docs, the Tuxera site and Askubuntu and found no discussion of the write-safety of NTFS-3G. The only thing that was mentioned somewhere is that the driver doesn't support the NTFS journal.\nSo, the question is, can I use NTFS-3G and be sure that I will later read what I have written to the files? Won't, for example, Windows find the journal entries missing and 'clean up' the data according to its own faulty understanding?\n\nA: I've been using ntfs-3g since I started using Ubuntu when it was 9.04.  I havent yet run into any issues with read/writeability using the ntfs-3g driver.  You should be fine with using the ntfs-3g drivers.\n\nA: As you can see HERE it is 100% compatible Read/Write NTFS for Windows XP, 2000, 2003, 2008, Vista, 7 and whatever other NTFS windows system comes out or missed.\nAnd I quote:\n\nNTFS-3G is a stable, full-featured,\n  read-write NTFS driver for Linux,\n  Android, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD,\n  OpenSolaris, QNX, Haiku, and other\n  operating systems.

Just comment out the line as described in the file:\n\n#  For sites which prefer IPv4 connections change the last line to\n#precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  100\n\nA detailed explanation on gai.conf can be found in the man gai.conf(5).\n\nA: If you don't want IPv6 enabled at all, you can disable IPv6 to accomplish this.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/05/how-to-disable-ipv6-in-ubuntu-1004.html\nif not, you can try addding\noptions single-request\n\nTo your /etc/resolv.conf file.  (see http://udrepper.livejournal.com/20948.html for gory details)\n\nA: My problem was the same, i had IPv6 queries made before IPv4 and they where wasting resources, so I did changed my /etc/gai.conf file as freddyb posted, but my scenario is a little bit different, my server is Natted, so IPv4 will not have precedence over IPv6 with only that line. The solution is also commenting out others lines at /etc/gai.conf so it will look like this\n# For sites which prefer IPv4 connections change the last line to\nprecedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100\n...\n#    For sites which use site-local IPv4 addresses behind NAT there is\n#    the problem that even if IPv4 addresses are preferred they do not\n#    have the same scope and are therefore not sorted first.  To change\n#    this use only these rules:\n#\nscopev4 ::ffff:169.254.0.0/112  2\nscopev4 ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104    2\nscopev4 ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96       14\n\nSo your server will try first ipv4 even if you are Natted!\n", "Q: Is there a way to check when the OS was installed?

Check /var/log/dmesg for errors relating to that disk.\n\nA: Not sure if this helps, but I once had an Athlon 64 machine whose motherboard had some sort of problem with the Ubuntu drivers and gave a very slow transfer from/to the attached HDD's. I think it was a Gigabyte motherboard, and this was several years ago.\nIf I were you, I would search specifically for problems based on your motherboard, although another good thing to note would be whether the transfer was ever faster on your computer.\n\nA: That filefrag utility was a neat pointer. If it's not that then either your disks\nare in terrible shape or something on your system is syncing so often that\nyou're not able cache enough of pages to achieve any sort of respectable throughput.\nhdparm -tT /dev/sda  will give you a fair idea of what your disks can do.\nExample\n\n/dev/sda:  Timing cached reads:   1370 MB in  2.00 seconds = 685.02\n  MB/sec  Timing buffered disk reads: 164 MB in  3.03 seconds =  54.18\n  MB/sec\n\nIf your buffered cache reads are no where close to this then there's your problem\n", "Q: Bzr and ubuntu one problem So I've got a folder with a programme I'm working on. I'm using bzr to keep revisions of it... and whenever I commit to bzr it seems to create conflicts... ooor\nI'm editing the files in Matlab (ok it's not a real programme but whatever) and i'm not sure if this causes the problem.... Any suggestions?\n\nA: I do not use Bzr but Mercurial and Git.\nAnd as far as i know using both a sync service and a revision tool on the same folder may create problems especially if that folder is updated by on several computers running Ubuntu One (or any other file syncing service afaik).\nI've been having a few issues with ubuntu one and mercurial and i think it has to do with the fact ubuntuone and the mercurial repository might not be in sync depending on the sequences of changes and commits. For instance I might update files on one computer and not commit them or get updated file from ubuntuone before or after i pull changes.\nI think a second reference point (the bzr/mercurial/git) repository is enough to confuse ubuntuone.\n", "Q: Can a wine app access files outside of the wine drive_c environment? I am running Avisynth witih avidemux+avsproxy in wine, but the files which AviSynth needs to access via its .avs scripts must be in Windows format (eg. \"C:\\my\\avisynth.avs\").\nMost of the files I want to access are not in wine's drive_c...\nIs there some way to address my home directory, and other  drives/directories?  .. eg. as drive_d..drive_n perhaps? \n\nA: Wine manages the drive letters through the ~/.wine/dosdevices directory.

I was working on a file live by editing changes to a file on FTP by mounting the FTP on Ubuntu and using gedit to make changes.\nAfter work, I shut down my machine and now I realize that the file on FTP has been wiped of its content. Any ideas if gedit might have a cache copy of it?\n\nA: If you have already shut down, there is unlikely to be any leftovers from any in-memory copies of the contents gedit was editing.\nIn gedit, there are preference options to create backup files.  Look for these options under Edit...Preferences...Editor.  If you happened to have turned on the autosave function, you may find a copy of the file with ~ appended to the name stored in the editing location (but in this case, I suspect you would have found it when looking at the FTP site).\nIn summary, probably not (and you probably already did something else to recover the content in the last 15 weeks), but if you set this option, you may discover that the answer is \"Yes\" in the future.\n", "Q: Spread only windows of the current application I want the same effect as with Super + W but for only the selected windows.\nIs this possible to achieve this?\n\nA: Yes, it's very easy. Press Super + [number] twice.\nFor instance, if you want to view all the Nautilus windows you have opened, press Super + 1 1 if Nautilus is the first item on your launcher.\nAlso, clicking on the icon of an active application that has more than one open window has the same effect. \n\nA: Looking at the Unity source code, this sure is possible, but isn't easy. Unity implements such a view, using the Compiz Scale plugin. First, Unity generates the list of windows of an application and then passes this to Compiz.\nSo without Unity you can't do this (as for now), since such a feature isn't in Compiz out of the box.\n\nA: Theoretically, yes you can.\nInstall compizconfig-settings-manager \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nLaunch CompizConfig Settings Manager and go to Scale > Bindings > Initiate Window Picker for window group.\nI say theoretically because it doesn't work for me (but it does work for others).\n", "Q: Hyper-v and ubuntu 10.04 apt-get update I have issues with 10.04 and 10.10 servers.

It's kind of hard to describe what that is, but when it does, alot the pixels go \"green\" and the image becomes blurry, sort of. I've confirmed this to be an error in the monitor, and not the GFX card.\nI can get it to snap out of 'green-mode' and go back to being completely normal by either logging out and back in again, or by switching user.\nFor a long time (running Windows) I was able to achieve the same effect, simply by changing the resolution forth and back. This has previously worked in Ubuntu, but it doesn't any longer. I've had the same thing happen in Windows, where it's normal resolution resizer, didnt do the job, but then after an update, it worked again.\nI'm running NVIDIA drivers.\nIs there anyway to get Ubuntu doing the same?  It feels as if the resizing isnt done \"hard\" - you can sort of tell if the entire screen goes black while resizing, or if it just resizes.\n\nA: Looks like updating graphics card driver fixed this issue.\nI would suggest to wait for a while & continue using it before you are sure that the problem is fixed and then you can mark this answer as accepted.\n", "Q: Keyboard Mouse Problem I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop (Core 2 Duo Sony Vaio) and am having a problem with the external keyboard and mouse.

But Then randomly other problems happen. (Shift gets stuck, keys don't work etc) The keyboard and mouse are a generic brand wireless (A4 Tech) that I got for cheap. Both work OK under windows so this is a major pain. \n\nA: I've witnessed a similar problem from a customer a few weeks ago.

Depending on the distribution version you run you may also suffer from this. According to bug #322909 #30 it may help to ignore PCM volume settings rather than mergin them by editing /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common as root and changing the entry\n[Element PCM]\nvolume = merge\n\nto\n[Element PCM]\nvolume = ignore\n\nAfter that a system reboot is needed for changes to take effect.\nThere may be other options in this file (that controls ALSA/Pulseaudio) you could try out if the above does not help.

When I run it, it says\nwine: cannot find :\"C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\DO.exe\"\n\nI can't find a DO.exe program on my windows computer.  I suspect it's trying to run some kind of command script internally (Earlier it asked for system32\\find.exe, which I was able to copy over).\nSo, is there a better way to run this so that wine will be able to translate and run the script correctly?\n\nA: Contrary to find.exe, do is not a windows program but is part of the cmd.exe shell (windows' commandline) and is used in for loops and maybe in some other places (don't know much of cmd.exe syntax).\nBecause the wine implementation of cmd.exe doesn't understand all of windows cmd.exe syntax, it try to look for an external executable for resolving a command that it should resolve itself, but there is no such thing as a do.exe executable.\nYou may try to look at what script is executed by your program (find .bat and .cmd text files) and edit for loops so that they run in wine.\nOr if you feel brave you may look at this patch (see comment 2 attachment) and see if it helps (seems it will not apply to recent wine versions but should be easy enough to adapt).\n\nA: Associate .bat files with this command:\nwine cmd.exe /c\n\nor open from terminal:\nwine cmd.exe /c <FILE>.bat\n\n", "Q: Can I change the Firefox menu to look like the Firefox menu in Windows? Why Firefox's main menu is different in Ubuntu (10.04) and windows 7 ? Is different main theme?. \nCan I change the Ubuntu Firefox menu to look like windows 7 menu?\n\n\n\nA: To activate the new Firefox 4 layout with the \"Firefox\" button replacing the menu bar, uncheck View ---> Toolbars ---> Menubar. \nBut in Linux you will get just a plain grey button instead a orange one like in Windows.\nBut there are several fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://userstyles.org/styles/43590/firefox-4-menu-button-v2-linux (requires Stylish Addon)\n\n*http://userstyles.org/styles/43513/firefox-4-menu-windows-look-alike-linux (requires Stylish Addon)\n\n*https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/themed-button-for-linux/ (Stand-alone Addon)\n\n\nA: You can go further than just unchecking the Menu Bar (though this is the first step). Simply install the Movable Firefox Button extension and you get a nicer button that you can move all over the place.\nI stick mine on the right of the tabs because I only use it very rarely\n\n\nA: #appmenu-toolbar-button {\n  list-style-image: url(\"chrome://branding/content/icon16.png\");\n}\n#appmenu-toolbar-button > .toolbarbutton-text,\n#appmenu-toolbar-button > .toolbarbutton-menu-dropmarker {\n  display: none !important;\n}\n\nThis trick is for Ubuntu only (because that is all I have tested it out on, you can try other linux distributions but will not work on Windows):\n\n\n*\n\n*When you hide the menu bar as suggested by M.

I am currently running a VM of Ubuntu 10.10 within VMware Player (host & vm stats below) and I'm getting horrific lag. I've executed the initial setup of the vmware files but nothing beyond that. I'm not really sure where to go from here and any help would be awesome.\nThe weird thing is, its not laggy all of the time. Occasionally it'll be snappy as if it were host OS.

May I suggest that you use tools such as top, free -m and iotop on your host to find out if it is the CPU, the memory or the IO that's causing problems? Once you have a better idea of what your bottleneck is, assuming that there is one, then it'll get easier to find out how to solve it.\n\nA: Online benchmarks suggest otherwise, but in my experience, VMWare is just horrible for IO performance.  Maybe the issue is that IO bandwidth is good, but everything else lags while it does the IO.  Try VirtualBox; you'll probably find it's MUCH better.\n\nA: Also, but probably not the full-answer, would be that you install the thing to the VD, or else you are sitting there on a live boot...\n", "Q: amd64, i386 (32bit / 64bit) - Which version to choose? Can every CPU (in my case a Intel i7 890) install both of them ?\nAmd64 and i386 ? I would like to install Ubuntu 64bit. So what is the right download ?\n\nA: Your CPU can run both versions. Which version you install is more or less up to you, however, if your machine has at least 4GB of RAM, I would recommend installing the amd64 version. Some more insight into the differences between 32 and 64bit architectures can be found here. As for stability and availability, it seems you've already covered this in another question, so I won't go deeper. ;-)\nYou can get your download here. Choose 10.10, the latest version. \nIf you're in no hurry, you can wait about a month, then the next version (11.04 - Natty Narwhal) will be released, with significant changes to the default user interface. \nIf you're a beginner you will save yourself some re-learning. \nIf you're especially patient, it may be good to wait another two weeks or so, then the worst, inevitable, bugs popping up at release will probably be fixed already, and your ride will be smoother.\n\nA: Yes, an i7 can run both the 32bit and the 64bit versions. It's just a matter of which iso to download: get the i386 one if you want a 32bits OS, and get the amd64 one if you want 64bits.\n\nA: Yes i7 works fine with both architectures, but no particulares evidences about performance. Usually a reason of this choice it's due about how much ram u have installed on board. If u need to map over 4gb 64bit works better, this one of main difference...\n\nA: If your processor is 64 bit use that one.\nIf you have an older machine that is 32bit use that one.\nThe 32 bit version will run on a 64 bit processor but not vice versa.\nThe 32 bit version will only support 2G memory.

This is almost the only reason I flip back to Windows on my Dual Boot Machine.  Thanks.\n\nA: A VM should certainly work, I've used it for SlingPlayer in the past and there were no problems.\nThere is also evidence that you can get the player going with Wine on Ubuntu:\nSee:  http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=14848&iTestingId=53229\nThe test results are for 10.04, but you should have similar results with 10.10.\nIf you're not very comfortable with Wine, you can take a look at the commercial adaptation of Wine, called CrossOver.  Here is their page on SlingPlayer 2.0 compatibility:\nhttp://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=5611\n\nA: Another way is to use genymotion and virtualbox to install Android emulated device(s) on Ubuntu, then install slingplayer in the usual way from the google app store (you'll have to pay for it though).  I'm on ubuntu 12.04 fyi.  The incentive though is that you will get a full-featured slingmobile player complete with online program guide etc. which afaik you can't get with any other method of putting sling on linux (facebook app also does not provide program guide).  I will just note also that the sound delivery can have some issues with the genymotion vm's and sometimes vm has to be restarted.  Still, it's another way.  Here's how you setup genymotion:  http://linuxicle.blogspot.com/2013/10/install-genymotion-in-linuxubuntu-1304.html\nIn my case, I selected the \"Nexus One - 4.2.2 - with Google Apps API 17\" VM.

Then i opened terminal in folder and typed -\n./ configure but then an error pops up permission is denied. I wanted to know how to install programs using terminal and how i can rectify the problems ?\n\nA: You'll probably need to make the configure file executable - open a terminal, cd to the extracted folder and run the following and see how you get on:\nsudo chmod a+x configure\n\n\nA: The file configure doesn't seem to have the execute (+x) mode set.

I often read that features such as DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) are provided on Windows. On Windows, you are given some control over turning on DEP for 32-bit programs. \n\n\n*\n\n*Are these features available in Ubuntu\n\n*is there anything we need to do to turn these features on?\n\n\nA: Yes for both. They are on by default; you don't need to do anything to enable it. Longer answer follows...\nDEP is used by default in Ubuntu. This is done via the NX bit if the CPU supports it, or emulated via memory segmentation if the CPU does not support it. For more details, see the non-executable memory feature item.\nASLR is used by default in Ubuntu on any memory segments that can be relocated (stack, libraries, heap, mmap). The only portion of a program that is not relocatable by default is the main code area (\"text\" segment). Programs need to be specially compiled as PIE (position independent executable) to enable this. Many sensitive programs are already built this way. For more details, see the list\nMany additional security features are also available by default in Ubuntu. See the Ubuntu Security Features documentation for the full list.\n\nA: The Linux kernel, by default, does make use of similar technologies, however they are different from the Windows versions. If your processor has the capability to set the NX bit (most modern CPUs), then the kernel will make use of it. There is also a weak implementation in ASLR in the kernel, and stronger ones can be installed, but are not installed by default on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Generally and simply speaking, you would need a PAE version of the kernel for this. For detailed information on this topic see this summary.\n", "Q: pdftohtml outputting low resolution background images. help? runnning: \npdftohtml -c document.pdf output.htm\n\nthis returns the normal output but the background images are of such low quality\nthey cannot be read. \nIs this a bug with pdftohtml or can I change a config \nfile somewhere?\nany help would be much appreciated, cheers :)\nrunning:\nUbuntu 10.04 LTS\n\nA: I am not quite sure but see if your problem is due to this bug http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/RybTrtkbz0vNyQrK1IlX\nThat said what you are doing even without bugs, is fraught with potential output disasters, PDF is a complex document format usually not intended to be converted to other formats, it is principally for display and printing as is.\nText and picture extraction is easy with the same tool you mentioned without the -c switch which tries to preserve the look of the original PDF, \nI would say try to convert without using the -c switch,this will likely get you good enough images but the layout may not be what you want, but maybe you could create something to fix it up. you may not have to fix anything if the PDF is simple.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you can configure it, but you could try using Openoffice with the pdf-import extension to do your conversions.\n", "Q: How do I disable Compiz in the Ubuntu Classic session?

You'll need something like a\nQlogic or Emulex HBA to connect to it. The connector should look\nlike a fiber optic cable. In re-reading your question, this is \nnot an array for home use, it's quite sophisticated. It doesn't\nsupport iSCSI so it must be directly attached to a host and shared\nto your network through other means.\nThe array itself is well documented, there's no shortage of docs\non the HP site surrounding the MSA 1500, like this one MSA 1000/1500 CLI Guide.\nEven without multipath, you should be able to see the LUNs attached to your system\nto begin with. A tool like lsscsi is a nice way to aggregate the listing of all SCSI based storage on your system. You should see several LUNs with a make of HP.\nIf you don't, that means the array hasn't even provisioned a single LUN yet. It's up to you to setup the SAN, provide network connectivity, log into, and provision the storage. After that, a LIP event lip event example must be issued on your side to force a rescan on the fabric, or you could just reboot.\nIf you don't have multiple routes to the SAN than you can use it as is. If so, it get's a little more complicated. Considering your level of expertise, I would leave\nmultipath alone, which means only one port should be attached from the host to the SAN.\nOverall, it sounds to me like you need to commit to understanding this array and\nhow to administer it. This is no plug and play affair. There's copious documentation on this equipment to assist you in this exercise. Good luck!\n\nA: I have an MSA1500 CS at home for VMware testing. I use a Windows 2008 Server to manage the MSA using HP's raid management software (downloaded from the MSA support page). \nIts likely you can manage it all from the command line using a serial connection but I have never tried. \nThe Windows storage manager actually uses the Fiber HBA to manage the MSA. The MSA requires a special management cable which will cost you about 50 bucks to order. I can get you the part number if you need it. \nThe Sata enlosure is called an MSA20 and can be directly attached to a server using an HP raid card. Since the MSA20 is older technology the raid cards are only available in the PCI-X format not the new PCI-E. \nIn a RAID5 configuration the MSA's performance is pretty painful so hopefully you are not looking for fast access.\n", "Q: How do I install RabbitMQ? Can someone please help me by letting me know how to install Rabbit MQ server...any links are heartily welcomed...\n\nA: If you've got a recent version of Ubuntu then there's a version in the repositories: try this:\nsudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server\n\nIf this version is too old for you you can use the .deb file from the RabbitMQ site.\n\nA: Assuming you have a recent version of Ubuntu, the most supported way to install RabbitMQ is via apt-get install rabbitmq-server. The downside of this is that the official repos are usually a few versions behind. \nThe version available for Ubuntu Precise is v2.7.1, which is nearly 9 months old, at the time of this writing. However, with the upcoming (slated for October 18th, 2012) release of the next Ubuntu version, Quantal Quetzal, the rabbitmq-server package is getting upgraded to RabbitMQ v2.8.4. This version was released on 22 June 2012, so it's pretty recent.\nIf you need a more up-to-date version of RabbitMQ, you can add the Rabbit MQ repo to your sources list and install from them directly following these instructions, or you can download the .deb file, or you can build from source.\nI would recommend sticking with the supported repositories' version, but your needs may dictate otherwise.\n", "Q: Will two Internet connections be utilized by default? If I have two connections to the Internet (one via eth0 and the other via wlan0), will both be utilized by default?\n...or do I have to make some adjustments in order to have applications take advantage of both connections?\n\nA: The short answer is no.  A PC has only one given default gateway and that's used for all traffic.  You might still see some packets in/out of the secondary interface, but it'll be layer 2 stuff, not IP based.\nDo a netstat -r to see what direction your traffic is taking.\nThe longer answer is \"no, but you can bond your interfaces together, creating a \"virutal interface\" which is capable of using both cards\".

When using a virtual terminal with an external monitor, I would like to set the resolution to the monitors optimal resolution, but I'm not sure how.

I created an Ubuntu 10.10 live usb with persistence feature. And it works well on my PCs. But one thing annoys me is that each time I boot from live usb, I have to choose between \"Try Ubuntu\" and \"Install Ubuntu\". Is there any way to dismiss that dialog and boot directly to the live Ubuntu system?\n\nA: You can remove 'ubiquity' package, it should remove the switcher but removes the ability to install the system from that USB as well.\nThere's one more way: on boot of live USB there's a purple screen with keyboard = accessibility symbols in the bottom. If you press any key while it's shown, you'll get another boot menu, which allows to boot directly to the desktop, bypassing the switcher. It doesn't remove the switching completely, but at least works much faster.\n\nA: So far, I've been able to boot straight to my maverick netbook remix persistent live USB log in screen by edited the syslinux.cfg file on my USB drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your live USB, go to syslinux folder on it.\n\n*Open txt.cfg (better use a code editor like notepad++), & copy the first five line.\nThe code looks like this on my maverick netbook remix :\n\ndefault live\n  label live\n  menu label ^Run Netbook Remix from USB\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz\n  append noprompt cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-netbook.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz splash --\n\n\n*open syslinux.cfg, & change it's content with the code you've copied before. You can delete menu label ^Run Netbook Remix from USB or you can change it like this say Run Netbook Remix from this USB\n(basically you can put any line as long as you use say in front of it)\n\n*save the changes you've made on syslinux.cfg, & we're done.\nnote : backup the original syslinux.cfg in case the method I explained above is not working for you.\n\nA: I wouldn't do it the way you have, but it kinda depends what you want to use the USB key for. If you want to use it to do installs on computers then the way you set up the key is right. If you want to use it as a standard desktop install, that you can use on any random (or even just a few specific) machines then use this method instead:-\nFor this you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*1xUSB key onto which you will install Ubuntu  \n\n*2xCDR or DVD or USB key onto which you will put the installer  \n\n*1xComputer which is capable of booting off the above device\n\n\nSteps to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISO and burn it to a CD or DVD, or use USB startup disk creator (or unetbootin) to make an 'install USB key' \n\n*Insert the above media into a computer and boot from it\n\n*Choose 'Install Ubuntu' from the menu\n\n*Once booted to the installer, insert the USB key you want to install Ubuntu \"persistent\" onto\n\n*During the installer, when you get to partitioning, ensure you select the USB key inserted, to install Ubuntu onto.\n\n*\n\n*Meaning, don't mistakenly install Ubuntu onto the internal hard disk on the computer\n\n\n*At the end of the install you need to tell the installer to put GRUB onto your USB key, and not to overwrite the bootloader on the hard disk (or indeed the USB stick you installed from - I have made that mistake!)\n\n*Once the install is done, you can shutdown, pull out all the keys and optical disks, and take that new key to any machine and boot from it. \n\n\nAdvantages to this method\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a full desktop install that you can add packages to, remove packages from and generally fully customise as you would any install\n\n*You can enable encryption of the home directory during install so that if you lose the key you don't have to worry about losing your data\n\n\nDisadvantages to this method\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not as straightforward as making a persistent key, but it's no more difficult than a standard Ubuntu install\n\n*A full install on a usb flash key will cause more write cycles, and thus more wear and tear on the flash drive's memory, potentially causing it to fail much sooner\n\n\nA: I a Kubuntu 14 live usb bypass 'Try it' by changing the following in the syslinux folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Renamed syslinux.cfg to syslinuxOLD.cfg\n\n*Copied txt.cfg as syslinux.cfg\n\n*In the new syslinux.cfg 'append' line I removed the option ' maybe-ubiquity '\n\n\nThe first boot option now reads:\ndefault live\nlabel live\nmenu label ^Start Kubuntu\nkernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\nappend noprompt cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/kubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\n\nIt now reboots directly to Kub 14 \n\nA: Another Simple Method to loose Try / Install\nI usually use a USB with a Full install on it. It is no use for installing Ubuntu but a Full install is more secure, makes more efficient use of disk space and is more stable, among other things. Nowadays use \"something else\" when partitioning, or it is easy to overwrite the hard HDD. I also like to make the first partition either FAT32 or NTFS for use as a Linux / Windows Data partition.\nEditing the Syslinux file, as previously mentioned is also a good way to get rid of Try / Install. For 18.04 use /casper/vmlinuz not /casper/vmlinuz.efi.\nAn easy way to remove the Try / Install stuff on a persistent drive, is to go to System Settings, and set yourself up as a new administrative user. The Try / Install will disappear, you will be able to assign a password, and the drive can still be used to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to use application indicator for KDE application? How can I use libappindicator to create an application indicator for a KDE app in C++ without using GTK? The example shown here uses GTK to create the menu. Is this necessary? Is there a KDE application somewhere that uses an application indicator that I can check out?\n(I wanted to tag this question with appindicator and libappindicator, but I don't have enough \"reputation\" to do that.)\n\nA: Application indicators are based on KStatusNotifierItem. \nI'm not too familiar with it but here's a tutorial on how to get started. That's all you really need to get it to work, the app icon and it's menus should then render properly regardless of which desktop it's in.\n", "Q: Fan not working at all I have a Dell Studio 15 laptop.\nIt has an ATI mobility radeon graphics card using the opensource drivers\nIt is running ubuntu 10.04\nIt runs for a while (10-20 minutes) and then turns off.\nacpi -t  shows the cpu temperature slowly rising until it turns off.\nacpi -c  shows two cooling devices both set to 0 (off)\nI'm worried that this is damaging my laptop.\nIs their a way to force the fan to turn on any other way to solve this problem.\nI logged into the Bios to see if there was any way to force the fan on, while it was in the bios screen the computer turned off.

I'm guessing it's a hardware problem at this point\n\nA: Have a good look in the kernel log as sometimes you can see recommendations for turning things on or off.\nJust as an example I had a line that said  Local APIC disabled by BIOS it then gave a reccomendation to use lapic, after adding this to grub, it now reads Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling. Found and enabled local APIC!\n\nA: From your description you have a hardware problem, not a software problem. You should report this to your laptop's manufacturer.\n\nA: I updated the BIOS as suggested under the dell support website. (you can only do this from windows).\nRandomly turning off was listed as a common problem. And updating the bios was the suggested solution.\nMy fan now works under both windows and ubuntu. And so I can happily say this was not a ubuntu problem.\n", "Q: How do I get a list of installed files from a package?

The boot from CD was not working so to get the Ubuntu 9.04 disk to run I installed the Ubuntu 9.04 boot/autorun/start utility.\nThe installation went well and I have now upgraded to 10.10. However, now on boot I have to choose which OS to boot to twice.\nOnce with grub and then with what looks like the utility I installed from Ubuntu 9.04.\nHow do I get rid of the Ubuntu 9.04 utility?\n\nA: Try downloading EasyBCD for Windows and installing it. Once installed open it up (need admin privileges), then go to boot loader menu entries. Delete the Ubuntu one (dont worry this will not lock you out of Ubuntu), save then reset.\nWhat is happening is that the machine is booting to GRUB, and when you selecu Ubuntu, it boots directly with the parameters specified under that option. Select windows, and it will simply refer you to BCD (the Microsoft equivalent to GRUB), since GRUB cannot handle windows entries directly. If BCD has only one entry, or if it has been given a default, that can only be overridden via F8, then it will boot straight into windows without any visible indicators taking place.\nIt sounds like your 9.04 was installed via Wubi, inside of windows, but your 10.10 was installed via LiveCD. The Wubi installer does not install GRUB, but merely puts a link into BCD. The LiveCD installer, on the other hand, installs GRUB, leaving BCD for Windows entries, thus creating the choosing twice problem you have now. The one in your BCD is actually a separate installation.\n\nA: This is more of a question for windows experts, but basically you need to uninstall the program on windows. If you cannot find how to do that, try running msconfig and editing your boot entries.\n", "Q: Fixing IP Renewal After Laptop Suspend I have a Macbook Pro 5.5 running Ubuntu 10.04, and I've noticed that with some wifi networks, but not all, I'm unable to reconnect after coming out of suspension. I've tried both Network Manager and Wicd management daemons, and both get through validation, but get hung up on \"Acquiring IP address...\". The only solution I've found is to reboot the machine, after which it acquires an IP address very quickly.\nWhat's the underlying issue here? What would be a more efficient way to resolve the problem?\nEDIT: I've noticed that if I open Wicd and manually press \"Connect\", it fails to acquire an IP. However, if I do nothing and let it automatically try and connect, it acquires an IP and connects just fine...\nEDIT: Note, this problem is dependent on the wireless router I'm trying to connect to. I have no problems with a basic Linksys wifi router, or the wireless router simulated by an Android wireless tethering app. However, old crappy Cisco/Comcast/Verizon home wireless routers always seem to give me headaches with connecting only after I suspend. If I reboot, I can connect to them immediately.\nEDIT: I tried adjusting the DHCP Client setting in Wicd.\nOriginally, it was using dhclient, and a failed connection attempt would create a log like:\n2011/07/28 20:55:35 :: Listening on LPF/eth2/00:26:bb:1b:90:cc\n2011/07/28 20:55:35 :: Sending on   LPF/eth2/00:26:bb:1b:90:cc\n2011/07/28 20:55:35 :: Sending on   Socket/fallback\n2011/07/28 20:55:35 :: DHCPDISCOVER on eth2 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 5\n2011/07/28 20:55:40 :: DHCPDISCOVER on eth2 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 10\n2011/07/28 20:55:50 :: DHCPDISCOVER on eth2 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11\n2011/07/28 20:56:01 :: DHCPDISCOVER on eth2 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 18\n2011/07/28 20:56:19 :: DHCPDISCOVER on eth2 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 17\n2011/07/28 20:56:36 :: No DHCPOFFERS received.\n2011/07/28 20:56:36 :: No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: DHCP connection failed\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: exiting connection thread\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: Sending connection attempt result dhcp_failed\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: attempting to set hostname with dhclient\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: using dhcpcd or another supported client may work better\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: attempting to set hostname with dhclient\n2011/07/28 20:56:45 :: using dhcpcd or another supported client may work better\n\nNoting the recommendation to try dhcpcd instead, I installed, restarted the wicd service, and set it to use dhcpcd.

Which is frustrating...because that doesn't leave me with much recourse since I can't find any open source alternative to Broadcom's crappy driver.\n\nA: If you run\nsudo dhclient -r\nsudo dhclient\n\ndo you get a new IP address?  This will drop your current lease and attempt to acquire a new one.\nYou might also be able just to restart networking, rather than your whole machine:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue that I think I finally resolved.  I did several things to try and fix the issue but I think I finally got it.\nI uninstalled then reinstalled Network Manager.

I've created one password-protected RSA key to access my remote server via ssh using key-based authentication and added it to seahorse using ssh-add.\nI would like to prevent seahorse from asking me for the passphrase on every login.\nIs there any way to disable this? Or to enter it forever? Or to have one one user given trusted access forever?\n\nA: Launch Seahorse, find your \"login\" encryption key, then right click on \"Passwords: Login\" and choose \"Change Password\".\n\nEnter the old password, then hit the \"Okay\" button, leaving the new and confirm boxes empty.  You will be prompted about \"Unsafe Storage\".  Confirm this, and your keyring will be automatically unlocked when you log into your machine.\nNote that this really is \"Unsafe\" and should only be used if you encrypt your home drive, as otherwise losing your laptop will equate to opening up everything it has access to - that might include your Gmail password (if you use a Gmail checker) your WIFI passwords if you connect to WIFI, IM passwords and so on.  Looks like Chromium has started using it for storage too, as I seem to have a lot of site-specific stuff recorded in my keyring.\nPersonally I also uninstall Seahorse after setting everything up too, so that it's a little less trivial to see all my passwords in cleartext should I forget to lock my laptop!\nBe careful with unsafe storage.\n\nA: Here is the simple solution which worked perfectly for me on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:\nDisable \"SSH Key Agent\" in the autostart applet (\"Startup Applications\" aka gnome-session-properties):\n\nBackground Info:\nThe issue is due to the key manager gnome-keyring-daemon of which seahorse is only the graphical user interface. The daemon loads the ssh key agent when the user logs in. Therefore by disabling the SSH key agent applet the daemon stops managing SSH keys stored in ~/.ssh/ . More details can be found in the SSH section of the gnome-keyring-daemon wiki\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I found my way here while trying to do this myself, and this seems to do the trick:\n$ <seahorse_ssh-askpass> <key_path>\n\nYou want to make sure you use the ssh-askpass associated with Seahorse, and it might not be in the same place on every system, but in my case (Ubuntu 20.10) it was the following:\n$ /usr/libexec/seahorse/ssh-askpass <key_path>\n\nIf this executable location doesn't work on your system, you can try the following:\n$ locate ssh-askpass | grep seahorse\n\nWhich will list all files and directories containing ssh-askpass in the name and seahorse in the path. (You may need to install and set up mlocate on your system before you can run this command.)\nThe most common path for an SSH key is ~/.ssh/id_rsa, but you can check in the Seahorse GUI to see if it's something else. In my case, I used the following command:\n$ /usr/libexec/seahorse/ssh-askpass ~/.ssh/alpha_rsa\n\nIf you execute the command successfully, it will pop up a dialogue box listing the name of the SSH key and asking for your password. In my case I got a Vala error saying it couldn't grab the keyboard, and the password I entered got printed to the terminal, but this command seems to have succeeded in making that particular SSH key unlock automatically when my GNOME Keyring is unlocked.\nEDIT: it seems like maybe the more important thing was going into the Seahorse GUI, clicking OpenSSH Keys, right-clicking on the key in question, selecting \"Configure Key for Secure Shell...\", and adding each of the servers and usernames to use the key with. I had done this earlier today (before running ssh-askpass) but completely forgotten. Strangely, this part of the process doesn't seem to prompt for a password.\n\nAs an aside, if you don't want this to be a glaring security hole,\nit's worth making sure that your GNOME Keyring doesn't automatically\nunlock without a passphrase when you turn on your computer. In my\ncase, I have a YubiKey with a passphrase that I have to enter before\nLinux can even boot. You will also want to make sure that your\ncomputer locks automatically when you're not using it. But assuming\nyou have to enter a passphrase to boot up or log in and to unlock your\ncomputer (i.e. wake it from sleep), any SSH passphrase saved in your\nGNOME Keyring should be as secure as anything else in your GNOME\nKeyring.\n\n\nA: Any solution that would stop Seahorse from asking for the passphrase would involve writing the passphrase down to the hard drive (or something else). Which means anyone who steals your computer would be able to log in (as the password is also saved somewhere). This is pretty much the same as not having a passphrase in the first place.\nIn short, just remove the passphrase. The point of the passphrase is that if someone gains access to your machine and steals the key, you have some time (before they bruteforce the passphrase) to invalidate the key on any machines you use it on. Removing the passphrase doesn't make the key itself less secure.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu's mouse(pointer) weird? I used Ubuntu 10.04 previously and 10.10 now. What i felt is, it's pointer is a bit weird.

I'm not sure which process to use here, so you might guess and indicate it's a guess in the bug-report description. Let's say the process-ID is 1234 for purposes of this example. You would do the following:\nAlt+F2 \nubuntu-bug 1234\n\n\nA: I caught one reason for this occasionally happening was that my mouse's wire or some other object was touching my laptop's trackpad. Thus the two separate mouse inputs were colliding with each other and causing the mouse pointer to shake and not respond as well.\nRemoving the obstruction from the trackpad fixed it.\n", "Q: Why are there PPAs for each Ubuntu version? and not one ppa, which fits for every ubuntu version and all the following versions ?\nA global PPA would be a nice idea.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean.  A single PPA has pockets for every release, so you just have to add the one PPA and apt will get the appropriate package for your release.\nAs for why there are different packages for each release, that is because the package depends on the libraries in the release for which it was built and may not work on another release.\n\nA: I guess it would be confusing if the PPA only had software for certain versions. You add it, nothing happens. Also, if you had global PPAs, how many versions of Ubuntu would they have to support? How fast after a new version would they have to add support?\nIt's a nice idea, but probably impractical.\n\nA: Answer is the way apt works. one never specify the version of software to be installed. apt automatically fetch the right version for right ubuntu version. so different ppa are good for simple apt functionality.\n", "Q: Some \"For purchase\" apps not visible in software centre I recently read that Uplink was available from Software Centre.  But I go to the \"For purchase\" section of the software centre and there are only 7 entries.  There's no trace of Uplink (or Darwinia).  I'm running 32-bit natty and have refreshed my software sources, installed all updates, etc.  Is this app not available because I live in Australia?  Is there any way to make it appear so i can spend my $$?\n\nA: That application is likely not available for Natty (11.04).\n", "Q: How to delete and create a new firefox profile from tty1? How to delete and create a new firefox profile from TTY1?\n\nA: To delete all Firefox settings type:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.backup\n\nin a terminal. On next startup Firefox will create a new ~/.mozilla directory for a new session with default settings.\nTo restore your settings type:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.newbackup\nmv ~/.mozilla.backup ~/.mozilla\n\nThis way you can create a variety of settings to restore when needed.\n\nA: WARNING: This will delete everything in the Firefox config - there is no undo. \nWith that out of the way, to do that, you can run the following in the terminal.\nrm -rf ~/.mozilla\nrm -rf ~/.cache/mozilla\n\nThis will delete local settings and cache, including the extensions. \nEDIT: Thanks to one of the comments, there is a way to backup the firefox config.

It may work fine all day and then suddenly pages load 10 times slower. After awhile it comes back to normal performance. Reboot also helps. Please suggest how to investigate this?\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10 server, with most recent\nupdates (including kernel) \n\n*LAMP: \nApache/2.2.16, PHP 5.3.3, MySQL\n5.1.49\n\n\nA: There are multiple possibilities for degrading performance, but the most likely cause is a shortage on RAM, causing the system to swap.\nYou can use free -m to get the memory usage, an example output:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3632       2512       1120          0        233       1456\n-/+ buffers/cache:        822       2810\nSwap:         8192          0       8192\n\nThe actual free space that can be allocated is visible on the row with -/+ buffers/cache. If you find that your server is swapping too fast, you might want to lower the vm.swappiness setting. You can find your current swappiness setting by running sysctl vm.swappiness. It ranges from 0 - 100, a lower value will use the swap later, a higher value make the kernel use the swap earlier. If you decide to set this value to 10, you should run the next command to change it at run-time:\nsudo sysctl -w sysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nTo make it persistent (i.e. after a reboot), add the line sysctl vm.swappiness=10 to /etc/sysctl.conf.\n", "Q: @APP_INDICATOR_CFLAGS@: No such file or directory (Migrated from Ubuntu forums.)\nI'm somewhat new at building, so I'm hoping this is an easy explanation.\nDownloaded Nautilus source to patch for transparent background.\nPatching went well and fine.\nDuring building I received this: \nMaking all in libnautilus-private\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/[x]/nautilus-2.32.0/libnautilus-private'\n  GEN    nautilus-marshal.h\n  GEN    nautilus-marshal-guts.c\n  CC     nautilus-autorun.lo\ngcc: @APP_INDICATOR_CFLAGS@: No such file or directory\nmake[2]: *** [nautilus-autorun.lo] Error 1\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/[x]/nautilus-2.32.0/libnautilus-private'\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/[x]/nautilus-2.32.0'\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n\n\nA: I'm not very good at debugging build issues either but here goes.\nI can tell you that this is caused by the Debian patch 89_use_application_indicator.patch which references https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/497880\nApparently @APP_INDICATOR_CFLAGS@ from libnautilus-private/Makefile.am is not properly substituted with the output from pkg-config --cflags --libs appindicator-0.1.

However, in Windows, when I plug in my Nook, the Nook shows up in ADE in my library view.  It does not do so in Linux. I can simply copy the files to the Nook, as Linux treats it as a Mass Storage Device, but I download library books, and I think ADE has to do something special with the books for them to be recognized by the Nook as having the correct copyright info.  So, I have 2 questions.\n1)  Is it possible to get the Nook to show up in ADE?\n2)  If not, is there a sufficient workaround?  For instance, get ADE to \"authorize\" the book, then simply transfer it over to the Nook as Mass Storage Device via command line or drag and drop.  Or does ADE even need to do this?  \nNote:  I have used the Configure Wine program to map /media/nook to the D: drive, but it still doesn't work.\n\nA: As soon as ADE downloaded the ebook, it added the encryption keys to it.\nWith that, Calibre can decrypt the epub file and transfer it to your nook.\n\nA: This post in the Ubuntu Forums describes how to get Adobe Digital Editions to recognize the Nook.\nFrom the post.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Plug in the nook and it should auto-mount to /media/nook.\n  \n*Open the Wine Configuration tool (Applications->Wine->Configure\n  Wine) and click on the Drives tab.\n  \n*Find and click on the drive mapping for /media/nook. In my case\n  this was the I: drive.\n  \n*Click the Show Advanced button and from the Type drop-down,\n  select Floppy disk.\n  \n*Click Apply and leave the Configuration window open. In my case,\n  whenever I clicked OK or closed the window, it would not save the\n  settings. This could be an issue on my end.\n  \n*Open Adobe Digital Editions and the nook should appear in the\n  list.\n  \n\nI had tried this before, but I had AutoDetect selected as the type of drive, and not floppy (which is not obvious).  \nUnfortunately I found this answer 5 minutes after issuing the bounty.\n\nA: FWIW, I tried this and the NOOK still didn't show up in Digital Editions until I used Configure Wine, added \"digitaleditions.exe\" and told it to report Windows 7.  After I did that and closed and restarted Digital Editions, the NOOK appeared.\n\nA: Adobe Digital Editions would not recognize my NOOK no matter what I tried. I installed ADE through WineTricks so if I just click MENU > WINE > Configure Wine I got nowhere.  I had to go to MENU > WINE > WineTricks > Select ADE > RUN WINECFG.  Then under DRIVES tab I created a new drive letter F (it automounted E but would not keep changes) added directory /media/samdrucker/NOOK/  changed to floppy drive and wala, no more beating my head against the wall.\n", "Q: Forceably set permissions when running rsync Currently I am backing up gigabytes and gigabytes of data from a live server to a backup server using an rsync/ssh combination script, allowing for automated operation every night with a cron job.\nThe problem I am having is with permissions.\nRunning rsync with -a mode copies over the user:group and filemode, which are currently 54122:games and -rwx--S---.\nIn order to be able to execute the files on the backup server (don't ask me why the employer requires this), I've had to run a time- and cpu-costly (because of the sheer amount of data transferred) chown() and chmod() setting every file/folder to www-data:www-data and permissions of 755.\nIs there anyway I can setup rsync to forcibly set each file/folder to www-data:www-data and 755 or am I looking at this problem from the wrong angle?\nI guess I could run -rltD instead of -a (which is equivalent to -rlptgoD) but then what happens to new files? What permissions and owner:group settings do they receive?\n\nA: Amongst many other options rsync can change permission by running it with the option:\nrsync [options] --chmod=CHMOD source destination\n\nwhere you can also combine option --archive with the option --no-owner or --no-perms to exclude preservation of owner resp. permissions. For further options on very subtle settings for CHMOD see the manpage for rsync.\n\nA: If the permissions are already setup that way on the machine you are copying from you could try -p.  It saves the permissions.  Also you may want to try grsync.  It's a gui for rsync that makes some of the options more apparent.  Also -o preserves the owner.\nHope that helps.  Good luck.\n", "Q: cat command - will it overwrite?

Or should we flag with something specific ?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The last part of that command has nothing to do with cat; the >> is a shell redirect that will always append to whatever target file you are specifying.  If you used > instead, then it would overwrite the file.  \nThere are several other shell redirects, and you will be more productive on a command line if you learn what they all are and when to use them:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Redirections \n\nA: cat ~/temp_minhakey.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nappends the contents of ~/temp_minhakey.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, it does not overwrite it.

When you boot up, GRUB only shows a fixed number of options before it starts scrolling the list.  When you updated Ubuntu, it added yet another kernel version to the list, bumping Windows into the \"not visible until you scroll\" region.\nAt first I was hesitant to post this as an answer, thinking that I might be the only one to have made this mistake.

I've seen a whole bunch of posts on iTunes replacements for Ubuntu, and how to sync your iPodTouch with Banshee, Rhythmbox, etc. But here's my question: can you sync an iPod with both a Mac and an Ubuntu machine? I know if you try to sync a single iPod with iTunes on 2 different computers it won't let you. But I'm not trying to sync with iTunes on both computers. \nBackground: I use a Mac at work and Ubuntu at home. I'd like both computers to contain all of my music. I don't want to manually copy files by mounting the iPod as a disk. Is this possible? I'm fine with somehow declaring one machine as the \"master\" library (i.e. doing all downloads/purchases/deletes on that machine, then syncing the iPod to it and then syncing the second computer to the iPod.)\nI'm using: iPodTouch 4g, Mac OSX (10.6.7 Snow Leopard), Ubuntu Maverick\n\nA: Can you sync an iPod with both a Mac and an Ubuntu machine?\n\nIf you want to know whether you can or not, then my answer is YES, you can sync with bot computers. BUT, what if you download, for example, a song on your Ubuntu PC, use Banshee (or any other) to sync it with your iPod, and then connect it to your MAC, using iTunes?\nIf you do this, the downloaded song will be deleted, as iTunes copies the database on the hard drive to the iPod, and not backwards.\nTo be able to do this, you would need to copy the downloaded dong using YamiPod (or any other) to your PC, add it to iTunes, and sync it again.\nI don't want to manually copy files by mounting the iPod as a disk. \nIs this possible?\n\nMy recommendation is to use the Mac PC to manage your iPod, and if you want to make any changes with the Ubuntu PC do as I explained above.\nBut, if you want to use your Ubuntu PC to manage it, there is no problem (talking only about multimedia files, songs, video and photos. Syncing the calendar, or contacts requires more work) you can use it (As a mater of fact, I do).\nBut remember to disable the option that opens iTunes when you connect the iPod, or the one that automatically syncs it when iTunes is opened and the iPod is connected, this way you won't have any problems\n", "Q: A browser that supports css3 3d transforms? I am doing web development on a Ubuntu machine (Lubuntu 10.10 more specifically), and wondered if there is a browser that I can install (in the repositories or otherwise) that has decent support for CSS3 3d transforms (by using the word 'decent' here, I exclude Chromium which is incredibly glitchy).\nThing is, I hate switching to a different machine that runs Windows, just to test my code.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: So far, only Webkit browsers support CSS3 3D Transforms.  Chrome/ium is probably the most popular option, so if the version you tried wasn't working, you may want to update to the very latest -- something like the Chromium Daily Builds.  If even that is too buggy to work with, you might want to try a different Webkit browser for Linux.\nMidori and Epiphany are two decent options.  As an added bonus, I think both of these browsers will use the version of Webkit that you have installed on your system (unlike Chrome, which comes with its own version of Webkit).  That means that you should be able to build Webkit from the latest nightly source release, and Midori or Epiphany will automatically use that version.  Good luck!\n\nA: Take a look at this: CSS3 Presentation and Styling\nThe start of the document is here.\nEverything that is explained there works perfectly under Google-Chrome, Chromium-Browser and Mozilla Firefox, tested by me.\n(Move left-right using the arrow keys)\nMay be you wish to say what exactly you wish to test, and if possible, provide a sample.\nGood luck.\n\nA: New Opera 11.10 supports CSS3.

I'm having problems getting the Netbeans font to look nice, this has been a problem ever since I tried Ubuntu ~8. For some reason fonts look like they're not getting subpixel smoothing in Netbeans only, for the rest of the applications they look perfect.\nLook at how ugly the screenshot is:\n\nIt's not just the code area but every font in the application looks this way. I was looking around and apparently adding the following line to the .bashrc file should fix the issue but in my case it didn't:\nexport _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd'\n\nIt think it might only affect Java based applications, but I haven't been able to test another Java app to check the fonts out.\nDoes anyone know what can I do to fix this? How can I make Netbeans use the system font? \n\nA: The anti-aliasing of the fonts are not working correctly in Ubuntu Java Swing applications.\nAdd:\n-J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd\n\nto netbeans.config at the end of the netbeans_default_options string.\nYou can find the config file in the $NETBEANS_HOME/etc/ folder (e.g. /home/<user_name>/<netbeans_folder>/etc/netbeans.conf)\nExample:\nnetbeans_default_options=\"-J-client -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-XX:PermSize=32m -J-Dnetbeans.logger.console=true -J-ea -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -J-Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -J-Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=true -J-Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true -J-Dnetbeans.extbrowser.manual_chrome_plugin_install=yes -J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd\"\n\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but in my quest for the same problem, I tried all the tricks here without luck.  I thought I was just going to have to live with terrible text in netbeans.  \nThen I found this:\nhttp://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-57233#comment=27-472038\nBasically:\nUbuntu 13.10, Netbeans (7.3), Infinality font patches to freetype, OpenJDK7, and patches to it to fix Swings dismal font handling.  And it \"just worked\"!!!\nCopied here in case that link dies:\n\n\n*\n\n*install freetype\n$ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6\n\n\n*install infinality patch \n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:no1wantdthisname/ppa\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install fontconfig-infinality\n\nI had to do the following afterwards:\n$ sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.avail/52-infinality.conf\n$ sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf /etc/fonts/conf.avail/52-infinality.conf\n\nTo use Windows 7 like font rendering do the following:\n$ sudo /etc/fonts/infinality/infctl.sh setstyle win7\n\nSet USE_STYLE to \"WINDOWS7\" in /etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh\n\n*install font fixed OpenJDK\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:no1wantdthisname/openjdk-fontfix\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nIn .../etc/netbeans.conf, \nnetbeans_default_options includes:\n-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd and \n-J-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true\"\nand set \nnetbeans_jdkhome=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\"\nThis changed my Netbeans fonts from 1990's acceptable to modern day awesome.  And I can now use the Inconsolata as my Netbeans editor font and it looks GREAT.\nScreen shot as requested: (actual text is clearer than this capture.  something in the capture blurred it slightly).\n\n\nA: As has been stated in the comments, this is a problem with Java Swing apps on Linux. Swing does use Gnome's font smoothing settings (deactivated, greyscale or subpixel) - it disregards the hinting settings though. It always uses full hinting, and if you're running Ubuntu with little or no font hinting (as most people do since little hinting is the default setting) this will make the font appear significantly different than in other applications. SWT applications like Eclipse are fine, but if you like Netbeans this isn't gonna help you.\nCaveat: For the following workaround I'm only talking about the editor font, because in an IDE that's what's important to me. You could also apply it to the menu fonts etc, but that might be a little over the top.\nThe only usable solution I found here : use Fontforge to edit your editor font of choice and remove all hinting information from the font itself, then save it as a new font and use that in Netbeans.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install fontforge\n\n*Launch Fontforge\n\n*Open your font of choice\n\n*Ctrl+A or edit -> Select -> Select all to select all characters\n\n*Hints ⇒ Clear instructions\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+F or element -> font info to open the font info\n\n*Rename font (e.g. to original name + '_nohints')\n\n*Save edited font in the .fonts directory in your home, through file -> generate fonts, making sure to use a format that Ubuntu reads (see next step)\n\n*Clear font cache fc-cache -rv - following its output to make sure your new font file was picked up (e.g. .sfd doesn't but .ttf does).\n\n*Run Netbeans and use the font you created as editor font\n\n\nNo, not perfect and yes, a bit of a hassle, but still a world of difference. Hope that helps.\n\nA: It's not so bad that font..\nHowever, this is a Java application and as a particular way of handling fonts.\nIf you want only to change font size, you can start Netbeans with \"--fontsize\" parameter:\nnetbeans --fontsize 12\n\nIf you want change the font type, it is a bit more hard changing environment parameters, and this article explains very well:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java_Runtime_Environment_Fonts\nThis is for ArchLinux but I think it will work also in Ubuntu as Java is a universal software.\n\nA: I had the same issue on Ubuntu 12.04 and Netbeans 7.2.\nI tried adding -J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd to netbeans.conf but it did not solved the problem.\nThen I saw the issue comment regarding the line height at Netbeans bug 215785.\nSetting the editor line height to 1.0 along with AA settings in netbeans.conf solved my problem.\n\nA: Going one step further to manual ways, I have prepared a dedicated font named as \"Ubuntu Mono Nohinting\" to workaround a rendering issue with Java Swing applications such as NetBeans IDE, IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm. The font hinting information has been stripped from the original Ubuntu Mono font family.\nHow to install\n\n\n*\n\n*download the zip file from here    \n\n*extract it\n\n*open *.ttf with Font Viewer to install.  \n\n*or you can manually copy *.ttf into ~/.local/share/fonts/.\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Ubuntu Mono Nohinting\" in editors' configuration.\n\n\nScreenshots\nUbuntu Mono Font with PyCharm Monokai theme\n\nUbuntu Mono Nohinting Font with PyCharm Monokai theme\n\n\nA: Add the following code to the end of the netbeans_default_options your netbeans.conf file.\n-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on\n\nThis will make use of the system fonts.\n\nA: Add\n--laf Nimbus -J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd\n\nor\n-J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd --laf Metal\n\nat the end of the default_options string in the file netbeans.config.

This will make the top and context menu the same as the OS.\n\nStep 2 (I don't know if this will work in all Ubuntu versions):\nNext you probably want the projects fonts too look nicer, what I did to fix that was run this in the terminal: sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool I launched it and chose a different default font Now Netbeans looks pretty!\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nA: Just saw this posts and tried to fix my fonts problem, I had also issue, I could choose only 4 fonts all were lame, and wondered what happened that netbeans give only 4 fonts to choose from and also lame font chooser box, I am a big fan of netbeans and I knew I can find solution here.\nany way I followed all possible guid.\nI use Ubuntu 13.10 and netbeans 7.3 (yes I love the unstable stuff)\n\n\n*\n\n*create .font folder in my user folder.\n\n*copied all fonts I had to that folder.\n\n*added the following line to the netbeans.conf file\n\n\nfind it by running:\nlocate netbeans.conf\n\nedit it and added the following inside the quotes as suggested above\n-J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd --laf Metal\n\n\n\n*\n\n*run netbeans update which I think did the magic now I have beautiful font chooser and have more fonts to choose then code to write (unfunny joke).\n\n\nI hope it will help you.\n\nA: Personally, I think the overall default appearance of Netbeans on Linux is a bit disappointing especially considering how nice it looks on other platforms.  Thankfully, changing the look & feel (LAF) can be done easily from inside the IDE.  Depending on your selection, this will often improve the appearance of fonts.  \nTo change the LAF, do the following:\nClick on Tools >> Options\nIn the dialog box, select Appearance then the Look and Feel tab\nSimply select one of the LAFs.  My preference is Nimbus, but you may prefer something else.\nThere are also two 'Dark LAFs' plugins available:  Dark Metal and Dark Nimbus.\n\nA: You can use JetBrains Runtime for font rendering.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download JDK - https://bintray.com/jetbrains/intellij-jbr/jbrsdk8-linux-x64/1638.3\n\n*Extract to folder /home/user/jre\n\n*Edit etc/netbeans.conf:\n\n\nnetbeans_jdkhome=\"/home/user/jre\"\n\n\n\n*PROFIT\n\n\nAfter and before: https://bender.kr.ua/netbeans-and-fonts/\n\nA: #!/bin/sh\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Ubuntu 10'\nsh /home/xxx/netbeans-7.2/bin/netbeans &\nsleep 5\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Ubuntu 11'\n\n\nA: I myself have done a little different thing: in my case, speaking of NetBeans version 8.0.1, the problem was the JDK installed on the system (Oracle JDK 8.0). After moving to OpenJDK 8 nicer fonts appeared in the user interface elements. \nI don't know if that is a good answer, because it may not work everywhere, but certainly - trying by switching JDK (be it OpenJDK or Oracle JDK) you may see a difference.\n\nA: I've tried literally every solution that I could find and none worked except using a different default JDK for NetBeans.\nOracle's JDK doesn't render fonts well. OpenJDK also doesn't seem to work for NetBeans but works wonders for IntelliJ and its siblings.\nThe one that worked for NetBeans is called TuxJDK which is essentially OpenJDK enhanced for Java developers working on Linux. One of the enhancements is excellent font rendering.\nHere's how to use it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download TuxJDK binary from here. (\"tuxjdk-static-8.92.03.tar.xz\" at  the time of writing)\n\n*Extract the tar.xz wherever you like.\n\n*Copy the location of the TuxJDK directory.\n\n*Open netbeans.conf located in NetBeansInstallationDirectory/etc/.\n\n*Find the line which starts with \"netbeans_jdkhome\" and replace the path with the one copied in Step 3.\n\n*Fire up and NetBeans and treat your eyes with some beautiful fonts!\n\n\nBefore:\nNetBeans before using TuxJDK\nAfter:\nNetBeans after using TuxJDK\n\nA: Just install zulu jdk from http://zulu.org :)\n\nA: I was having the same issue on Mint 12.

First, I'm not sure if this is the correct venue to be asking this question, so if not, I apologize. \nI'm a big fan of Tomboy notes and the ability to sync them with UbuntuOne. I like having my notes accessible across all of my computers, and would like to be able to do the same thing on my phone. I know there is a client for Android, but from what I could tell, no such client exists for iPhone. \nI'd been meaning to play around with learning some iPhone development anyway, so I did some reading on iOS development, spent some time, and wrote an application that does most everything that I use Tomboy for. It can link to your Ubuntu One account, sync notes back and forth, and it supports the majority of the formatting (bold, underline, highlight, etc.) options. I'm sure that someone more experienced in iOS development could have done a better job, but it seems to work well enough for what I need.\nI'd like to put it in the apple app store for free and make the source available (as I'm sure it could stand to be fixed and refined by someone more knowledgeable than myself), but I'm not sure what the rules are for such a thing. Right now I've just got it on my own computers and haven't gone to the trouble to pay to enter the Apple developer program because I have some questions about whether I can do so, before I spend the money.\nAs it stands right now, I've used the Ubuntu font in the application (font.ubunu.com), as well as some mentions of Ubuntu itself and the Ubuntu One logo. I suspect the use of the font is probably okay, but I have my doubts about the logo, so some rebranding might be necessary. More than that, am I even allowed to access the Ubuntu One Notes service in this way? I know Ubuntu has some mobile applications for syncing other Ubuntu One services (music, contacts, etc.), but I couldn't find mention of notes, and as I said before, I know that Tomboy and Tomdroid are already utilizing Ubuntu One as a sync destination. \nBasically, I was hoping someone might either know the answers to some of these questions, or be able to point me toward someone who does. Obviously I can just continue using this application for myself as it does what I wanted, but I thought it might be nice to make it available for other people and, if someone more knowledgeable about iOS development were so inclined, to improve it.\nSorry this was a bit long, and thanks!\nAdam\n\nA: I'm only going to answer about Ubuntu One; your question is actually several questions rolled into one, and I can only answer for what I know.\nYou can't use the Ubuntu One logo as your application icon. You can, however, use the Ubuntu One logo and name within your application if your intention is to use it to indicate a “works with Ubuntu One”, as long as you don't do anything obviously nasty. \nWe will have a specific “works with Ubuntu One” soon, but meanwhile please use some text such as “works with” and the icon.\nIf you need any special sizes or colours please contact us in private.\nHoping to see your app live soon!\n\nA: To add to what Chipaca's written, I should say that you are not only allowed but encouraged to build apps like this that work with Ubuntu One.

Is it possible to configure firefox from terminal?For example if i want to set toolkit.networkmanager.disable=true in about:config can i do it from terminal?\n\nA: This setting should go into your Firefox profile prefs.js file, which should be located in ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/.\nThe file format is JavaScript, so in theory it could be mangled to the point of needing a JS parser to modify it, but Firefox is usually nice and prints each setting on its own line in alphabetical order. To add a setting like this you could simply\necho 'user_pref(\"toolkit.networkmanager.disable\", true);' >> ~/.mozilla/firefox/**replace**.default/prefs.js\n\nIf this setting is already in the file, I'm not sure whether Firefox will register the last or first instance. Just give it a try. If it's not consistent, you could do this:\nif grep 'toolkit.networkmanager.disable' ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/prefs.js\nthen\n    sed -i -e 's/^user_pref(\"toolkit.networkmanager.disable\", \\(true\\|false\\));$/user_pref(\"toolkit.networkmanager.disable\", true);/' ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/prefs.js\nelse\n    echo 'user_pref(\"toolkit.networkmanager.disable\", true);' >> ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/prefs.js\nfi\n\nAfter modifying the configuration you'll need to restart Firefox to apply the change.\n", "Q: Where to start?

I will appreciate if anyone can help me to do the right thing.\n\nA: My experience is that reading book wont help a lot. You will learn new things but you will forget most of them as you will not be using them. The best way to learn Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution is by practice, so use it as often as you can. Make sure you stick with it i.e keep using it and dont convert back to your old OS when doing something trivial is getting tough. Solve the issues when they arise and use Ubuntu for your everyday tasks i.e watching movies, listening to songs, text/document editing, browsing and etc. After a few days of initial discomfort you will find everything easy.\n\nA: Depending on your computing experience you may have some knowldege from your previous operating system (presumably Windows). You will find a lot of similarities where many tasks are no problem for you. However some things are done entirely different with Ubuntu. There it is almost impossible to foresee what your individual problems will be. It is this why reading a book will probably fail. \nBy running Ubuntu you will soon find out that there are few tasks if any that cannot be done. You will learn how to solve your hopefully few problems, and you will find out that solutions may be ridiculously easy once you know the answer.\nThe best starting point to get solid answers is where you already are: the Community and Ask Ubuntu. We look forward to your questions - just dare to ask.\n\nA: Learning by doing.Thats the only way.\nReading in forums, askubuntu and other webpages does help a lot. \nUbuntu-Users (german)\nUbuntu Forum (English)\nUbuntu Pocket Guide\n\nA: This was posted on the Unix forum. \nIt may be a bit more advanced than what the average new Ubuntu user wants.

You get to this by the edit menu in the Ubuntu Software Centre and select software sources. And check the PPAs you want to enable.\nReload the sources. Ubuntu automatically updates the version from ie. \"maverick\" to \"natty\". If a PPA has not been updated for the new version, you will receive errors when you reload the sources.  For each error go back and change \"natty\" back to \"maverick\" (or whichever version you updated from). This is usually safe as the packages generally work form version to version. Reload sources again and the PPA's should re-appear. You can wait a few weeks and try again with the newer version in case the PPA maintainer has updated his PPA.\n\nA: All the source files are located at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. You will need root privileges to edit the ppa files. See if you added ppa are there as a file. If they are located there see if the content of files are commented or not. If they are not in the above location you have to manually add the ppas using sudo add-apt-repository command.  \n\nA: Use Aptik to save and restore your ppas. This way you'll never lose them again. And make sure your ppa name matches your linux version name. E.g trusty for trusty, natty for natty, etc. Old ppa may not work on newer Ubuntu and viceversa.\nFirst add Aptik ppa to your system: sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa\nThen update your sources list: sudo apt-get update\nAnd finally install Aptik: sudo apt-get install aptik\nFor detailed screenshots of how the program works please visit: http://www.tecmint.com/aptik-a-tool-to-backuprestore-your-favourite-ppas-and-apps-in-ubuntu/ .

And every time I boot, Its file permission is changed to default (unwritable) by the system. So, i have to run chmod command every time i boot-up. How to change it's file permission permanently.\n\nA: Log files are usually created by logrotate. The apache logfiles definition is stored on /etc/logrotate.d/apache2\nThe file looks like this in one of my servers:\n/var/log/apache2/*.log {\n        weekly\n        missingok\n        rotate 52\n        compress\n        delaycompress\n        notifempty\n        create 640 root adm\n        sharedscripts\n        postrotate\n                if [ -f \"`. /etc/apache2/envvars ; echo ${APACHE_PID_FILE:-/var/run/apache2.pid}`\" ]; then\n                        /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null\n                fi\n        endscript\n}\n\nIf you look at the create option, the values after the keyword are the permissions, user and group. Just edit your file and change this values.\n\nA: I'm guessing anacron is running logrotate at boot time.\nIf so, try editing the configuration file /etc/logrotate.d/apache2, and change\ncreate 640 root adm\n\nto whatever you prefer, e.g.\ncreate 666 root adm\n\nBut other than the apache2 service, what else needs to write to this file?\nIf this is on a server, it's probably a bad idea to make the file world writable.  For example, if somebody breaks in to your system, they can remove the log entries that would help you find the problem.\nIf you want read access, it might be better to add yourself to the adm group, e.g.\ngpasswd -a `whoami` adm\n\nThis would also help if you really do need write access, e.g.\ncreate 660 root adm\n\nwould be sufficient.\n\nA: As per the discussion in comments, for the purpose the OP is trying to achieve (looking at a simple subset of logs for a specific purpose), this may be an appropriate alternative solution:\nTail will let you look at the last lines of a file \nGrep lets you search through a file for instances you want to find\nBoth are available as part of Unix/Linux and should be part of your essential toolkit.\n", "Q: How do I configure Unity 2D? There are several options to configure Unity 3D via \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" respectively its \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\". \nBut how do I access Unity 2D's settings?  \n\nIf you are looking to configure Unity 3D see this question: How can I configure Unity?\n\nA: As of September 2011 - in 11.10, the \"simple GUI for Unity-2D Settings\" doesn't allow configuring most of the parameters - particularly the \"Launcher Preferences\" (dodge settings) are greyed out.\nIt seems the latest unity-2d doesn't use gconf, it uses \"dconf\":\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\ndconf list /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/\n\nreturns: \nhide-mode\nsuper-key-enable\nuse-strut\n\nYou can fix the launcher in place (and obstruct maximised windows from impinging on it by using):\ndconf write /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/hide-mode 0\ndconf write /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/use-strut true\n\n\nA: As user13281 commented:\nMariano Chavero has made \"A simple GUI for Unity-2D Settings\": http://marianochavero.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/a-simple-gui-for-unity-2d-settings-ubuntu-11-04/\n\nA: 11.10 & above\nUnity-3D and Unity-2D are visually very similar.  \nUnity 3D\n Unity 2D \nHowever, the underlying technology used to configure are very different.  \nUnity 3D uses a compiz plugin and you can use ccsm to configure.  \nUnity-2D configuration options are unfortunately not as advanced and involves tweaking a limited number of options in tools such as dconf & gconf-editor as well as changing the actual code base itself.\nNote - you can use alternate compositing options - thus configuration options will change:\n\n\n*\n\n*compiz\n\n*mutter\n\n*xfwm4\nChanging Themes\nUsing the stock Appearance screen you can change the theme to the hard-coded themes.\n\nIf you want to use other GTK+ 3 (metacity) themes via a GUI you will need to use either MyUnity or gnome-tweak-tool . \nHow do I change to a theme not listed in the Appearance screen?\nAlternatively - install the metacity theme and change the theme name using gconf-editor as described below.\nchanging fonts\nBy using MyUnity (installation instructions in the above theme link*) you can change fonts using:\n\ndesktop icons\nBy using MyUnity you can use the options shown in the image to add desktop icons\n\nForm Factor\nprecise only\nUnity-2D is used for computers that do not have 3D acceleration capabilities and/or have limited CPU/screen size etc.\nYou can configure Unity-2D to use by default desktop type settings or netbook type settings through dconf-editor\n\n\n*\n\n*/com/canonical/unity-2d/form-factor: by default this value is desktop - by changing this to any value other than this (e.g. netbook), Unity-2D will default to non-desktop type values.  An immediate visual indication of this is the Dash - any value other than desktop will open the dash full-screen.\n\n\nLauncher configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*Launcher hide action\n\n\nprecise\nIn 12.04 - the launcher is not hidden by default.  You can set the autohide capability through the stock appearance screen.\n\nFrom this tab you can configure where the launcher-hot spot is and thus how to invoke the launcher via the mouse.\nFor 11.10 and above, dconf can be used to modify the hiding action of the launcher.\ndcom write /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/hide-mode [foo] where [foo] is the following values\n\n\n*\n\n*0: never hide, launcher always visible. dcom write /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/use-strut true must be used with this value\n\n*1: auto hide; the launcher will disappear after a short time if the user is not interacting with it \n\n*2: intellihide; the launcher will disappear if a window is placed on top of it and if the user is not interacting with it\n\n*Launcher Icon size\nThe launcher icon size can be changed by changing the launcher code.\n\n\n*\n\n*moving icons - click and hold the icons to move launcher icons.\n\n\nDash\nprecise\nThe Dash can be now be easily maximised using the standard maximise/minimise window buttons.\nThe Dash opening configuration can be configured through a dconf-editor value:\n - /com/canonical/unity-2d/dash/fullscreen: ticking this value will open the dash fullscreen (default value is false)\noneiric\nBy default the Dash opens half-screen.  By changing the code-base you can configure the Dash to always open full-screen.\ngconf-editor\nUnity-2D uses metacity for its compositing manager - thus the options available to configure metacity through gconf-editor can be used to configure Unity-2D\nBelow is a summary of the values used to configure Unity-2D specifically.  Other metacity options are also available to be changed through gconf-editor\n\n\n*\n\n*/apps/metacity/general/auto_maximize_windows: Determines if windows should be automatically maximized when shown if they already cover most of the screen (default true)\n\n*/apps/metacity/general/num_workspaces: Number of workspaces. Must be more than zero, and has a fixed maximum to prevent making the desktop unusable by accidentally asking for too many workspaces.\n\n*/apps/metacity/general/theme: The theme determines the appearance of window borders, titlebar, and so forth (Default value Ambiance)\n\n*/apps/metacity/general/titlebar_font: A font description string describing a font for window titlebars (Default value Ubuntu Bold 11\n\n*/apps/metacity/global_keybindings/: various keyboard shortcuts can be defined.

For example, moving windows from one workspace to another. \n\n\nA: For 12.04\nUnity 2D supports quite a few options already. Having said that tweaking is (sadly) still a power user process. Here is a list of things you can do:\n\n*\n\n*A) Change launcher colour, backlit mode and hiding mode\n\n*B) Rearrange the icons in the launcher and the indicators order at\nthe panel\n\n*C) Enable opengl\n\n*D) More\n\nThe first thing you need to to is install dconf-editor. You can easily do that by starting a terminal and pasting the following command in it:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nAfter that, press ENTER, insert your password and wait for it to install. After it is installed open it. Now navigate to com => canonical => unity-2d:\n\nChanging the value of form-factor will change the Dash mode. \"desktop\" means that the Dash will be on small screen mode and \"netbook\" means Dash will be on full screen mode.\nTicking the checkbox \"use-opengl\" will allow unity-2d to use render graphics in opengl and not in raster engine.\nNavigating to \"Dash\" is useless, cuz that there is only one checkbox there - \"Full screen\" and you can already determine if you want the dash in small or full screen via \"from-factor\". Navgating to \"Launcher\" will allow you to choose select the launcher hide mode and also to select whether or not to use the super key.\nSwitching the variable of \"hide mode\" allow you to select if you want the launcher to be:\n\n*\n\n*0: Always Visible\n\n*1: Autohide\n\n*2: Intellhide (dodge windows)\n\nYou can easily rearrange the icons by clicking on icon holdoing, holding that and moving it :)\nAltering the launcher colour and opacity requires editing the \"Launcher.qml\", however the file is located in different folders in Oneiric and Precise. If you are using oneiric:\nHit ALT+F2 (or open a Terminal) and execute:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/launcher/Launcher.qml\n\nA text editor window will open with the file ready to edit. Navigate to section headed ‘rectangle‘ and change:\ncolor: “#190318″\nto\ncolor: “$COLOUR”\nwhere $COLOUR is whatever colour you like – fox example: pink оr green or #00ffcc.\nIf you are using Precise the Launcher.qml is located in /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/launcher so to edit it, you have to execute:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/launcher/Launcher.qml\n\nOnce it it you will have to navigate to chnage both \"rectangle\" and \"Gnome Background\" sections (Gnome Background) is just above rectangle.\nHere is a screenshot of a light yellow coloured launcher:\n\n\nA: gconf-editor > desktop > unity-2d\n", "Q: Switching graphics in Ubuntu ATI Will Switching graphics be supported in Ubuntu in the near Future ?

Following is a list of some of my hardware:\nMotherboard: Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD3R\nVideo: Radeon HD-567X-YNF3\nInitially, when I went to either Suspend or Hibernate the machine would almost go into suspend, but it would never power down.  Instead it would bounce back to the login screen.  This was due to a problem with the USB3 ports being unable to suspend (noticed this in /var/log/kern.log).  Disabling the USB3 ports in the BIOS fixed this issue.\nNow Suspend and Hibernate power down the machine.  It successfully awakens from Hibernate.  However, it will not return from suspend.  The mouse and keyboard are not powered and the monitor has no signal.  These devices are still not powered after a restart.  I must power-cycle the machine.  The pm-suspend log ends after it states that it entered suspend (i.e. there is no information any resume code running).\nI discovered that acpitool -s suspends the machine and resumes successfully exactly once.  The second time the machine will not resume.  I am not sure how these two tools handle suspend differently.\nUPDATE: the problem was introduced somewhere between 2.6.35-22 and 2.6.35-28.  I have both kernels install presently.  Suspend works fine with 2.6.35-22 but not with 2.6.38-28.\n\nA: Especially Suspend-and-Resume work better with a later kernel.\nInstalling a newer kernel is easy and even if it doesn't work, you can choose your old kernel in the grub menu when booting.\nTo install a kernel, please have a look at the wiki-page\nI'd recommend 3.1.2 from here because it's the latest stable version.\nYou need to download 3 files, the linux-headers-generic, linux-headers-all and linux-image file. \nInstall the 3 files with\nsudo dpkg -i linux-*.deb\nIf your computer complains about a missing module-init-tools package, you can download that here. \nInstall it with sudo dpkg -i module-init-tools*.deband repeat the install of the 3 kernel files.\nAfter the installation is complete, simply reboot and you will boot with your new kernel.\nTo make sure you are running your new kernel, open a terminal and type\nuname -r\n\nthe output should be your new kernel.\n", "Q: Google chrome extension install failure i want to install GoogleChrome extension yet whenever i click install it says\nExtension Install Failure.\n\nInvalid value for 'permissions[0]'.\n\nWhat causes that?\nthank you.\n\nA: Install the Chrome Development version.

I need to setup an environment that supports tkinter programming in python and maybe some network socket stuff too. I'd also like to emphasize that I need python 3.\n\nA: python-all, according to the docs, is a minimal package intended to avoid hard-coded dependencies on python versions.  \nThe two packages you would be looking for are probably python vs. python-minimal.  Between those two, the difference is pretty minimal.  For the most part, start tinkering with what is installed.  You'll probably find that everything is there.  If it isn't, look for a package or use easy_install.  \n\nA: According the ubuntu xenial library of python minimal it refers as follows\npython2.7-minimal (>= 2.7.11-1~)\nMinimal subset of the Python language (version 2.7)\npython\ninteractive high-level object-oriented language (default version)\nso by default if you got an installation that will be the python \n", "Q: Will GNOME Shell need compositing (like Unity does)? I fix computers to get a little extra money. I'm planning to buy a removable hard drive to carry important programs and stuff and I'd like to install Ubuntu 11.04 in it too. So, I can't install proprietary graphic drivers in it, so Unity 3D is out of question. \nCan I run GNOME Shell without installing drivers when I boot it in a Nvidia or ATI graphics computer?\n\nA: Both gnome-shell and Unity will require compositing in order to be used. You can install proprietary drivers and still have it on a USB/external drive - I do it all the time and move from computer to computer. Besides, you can always install the Gallium3d drivers for Nouveau and you'll have fully-supported 3d on all the important cards.\nBoth Unity and Gnome-shell are anything but out of the question.\n\nA: Yes, it will need compositing, however there is a fallback. From the GNOME3 FAQ:\n\nComputers purchased in the last 4 or 5 years should be more than capable of running GNOME 3. The GNOME 3 desktop does require hardware accelerated graphics in order to provide a cutting-edge experience however, and the complete GNOME 3 experience will only be available on computers capable of this. Do not worry though: GNOME 3 will come complete with a fallback interface which will provide an excellent experience in the absence of hardware acceleration, and which incorporates many of the improvements that can be found in GNOME 3. Furthermore, the GNOME project and its partners are working hard to ensure that the complete GNOME 3 experience is available to as many people as possible, and aim to ensure that users who are initially unable to have this experience will be able to in the future.\n\n\nA: Yes, open-source ATI drivers already provide 3D acceleration, and open-source \"Nouveau\" driver will provide 3D acceleration for Nvidia cards in Natty. It means that even Unity 3D and GNOME-Shell are likely to be usable.\nMoreover, you can install Unity 2D from Ubuntu repository (it's not included by default), it has almost the same functionality as its 3D equivalent and runs on even broader range of hardware.\n", "Q: How to downgrade gcc from 4.4.4 to 4.2.1?

The first login mounts and decrypts the directory letting the ssh daemon use the keyfile.\nSolution for that is to move the \"authorized_keys\"-file to a device where it is not encrypted by default.\nAfter that you have to point the ssh daemon to that place. The following configuration option is used for that.\nAuthorizedKeysFile\nSpecifies the file that contains the public keys that can be used for user authentication.  AuthorizedKeysFile may contain tokens of the form %T which are substituted during connection set-up. The following tokens are defined: %% is replaced by a literal '%', %h is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated and %u is replaced by the username of that user.  After expansion, AuthorizedKeysFile is taken to be an absolute path or one relative to the user's home directory.  The default is “.ssh/authorized_keys”.\nMaybe like this\nAuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/%u/authorized_keys\n\n", "Q: How do I turn off font pixel antialiasing only in Terminal? For programming, I like to turn off font antialiasing (i.e. select the Monochrome option) because it makes the terminal text look a lot sharper at smaller font sizes. But then everything in the web browser looks worse.\nIs there a way to have the best of both worlds, and have non-antialiased Terminal fonts, but antialiased web browser fonts?\n\nA: I have spent lots of time mucking with font and system configurations to get a decent non-anti-aliased font in Ubuntu Terminal. One solution was to install a dedicated non-anti-aliased TrueType font, such as Terminus. Set your Terminal preferences to use the Terminus 8 font, or use the Ubuntu Advanced Settings tool to set the global console font to Terminus 8.\nsudo apt-get install xfonts-terminus console-terminus\n\nI've yet to find a solution that lets me use my favourite font (X11 6x13) in Terminal. In the mean time, I have been using pterm and Putty instead of Terminal. The only downside is that pterm and Putty don't support tabs.\n\nA: You can control the antialiasing of fonts in ~/.fonts.conf.  Doing so on an individual program basis requires some trickery, though.\n<?xml version='1.0'?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>\n<fontconfig>\n  <dir>~/.fonts</dir>\n  <alias>\n    <family>XTerm</family>\n    <prefer><family>Envy Code R</family></prefer>\n    <default><family>monospace</family></default>\n  </alias>\n  <match target=\"pattern\">\n    <test name=\"family\">\n      <string>XTerm</string>\n    </test>\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"family\">\n      <string>Envy Code R</string>\n    </edit>\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"antialias\">\n      <bool>false</bool>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nThis creates a font alias called XTerm which maps to Envy Code R but disables antialiasing.  Run fc-cache ~/.fonts, and you should then be able to select that font in Terminal.\nIf you don't mind (or even prefer) the font used in the Terminal always being non-antialiased in any program, it's a bit simpler:\n<?xml version='1.0'?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>\n<fontconfig>\n  <dir>~/.fonts</dir>\n  <match target=\"pattern\">\n    <test name=\"family\">\n      <string>Envy Code R</string>\n    </test>\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"antialias\">\n      <bool>false</bool>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nwhich doesn't require any other font hackery and insures that Envy Code R is always antialiased.\nYou can also constrain the font sizes where antialiasing can be performed:\n<?xml version='1.0'?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>\n<fontconfig>\n  <dir>~/.fonts</dir>\n  <match target=\"pattern\">\n    <test name=\"family\">\n      <string>Envy Code R</string>\n    </test>\n    <test name=\"size\" qual=\"any\" compare=\"less\">\n      <double>8</double>\n    </test>\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"antialias\">\n      <bool>false</bool>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nto prevent antialiasing for Envy Code R when it is smaller than 8 point.\nThis article on the Arch Wiki shows how to tweak fonts in more detail.  man fonts.conf is a reference to the configuration language, but without much in the way of practical examples.\n", "Q: Ubuntu and Windows together I have Ubuntu and Windows installed together. I want to reinstall Ubuntu but I need to add some space from Windows D: disk. Is there any chance in losing data and if not please give me instructions.\nUbuntu installer using gparted, yeah? Is there any difference between if I resize D: disk or while installing?\n\nA: If you want to reinstall ubuntu only to change the partition size, you don't need to do that. You can use GParted (System - Administration) to resize the partitions, reducing Windows D partition and increasing Ubuntu's partition without reinstalling.\nTo install gparted:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nIf you need to reinstall for another reason, you can also use gparted to resize the partitions before reinstalling ubuntu with the live CD. I think it is safer than to do it with the installation program as you can control better what you are doing.\nEDIT after question edit:\nI think you can get the same result with the installer and with gparted alone but I feel you have more options and control using gparted before than within the installer.\n\nA: The Ubuntu installation disk should allow you to resize the Windows partition, but a backup is highly advisable.\n\nA: First off I should say that when working with partitioning there is always a chance something will go wrong. The advanced partitioning tool that ships in the ubuntu installer will allow you to change partition sizes as well as allow you to reformat and use your current Ubuntu and swap partitions for your reinstall.\n", "Q: Ad hoc 'Logmein Rescue' style remote desktopping?

I'd like to be able to simply run a script on a folder and have it upload and then spit out a list of URLs, for free, permanent, file hosting.\n\nA: Actually, I should have spent about 30 more seconds on Google ...\nhttp://www.archive.org/help/abouts3.txt says I can use the s3cmd tool:\nsudo apt-get install s3cmd\nAnd then edit the configuration file, so ~/.s3cfg looks like:\n[default]\nhost_base = s3.us.archive.org\nhost_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.us.archive.org\naccess_key = key\nsecret_key = key\nuse_https = False\nverbosity = WARNING\n\nThen use the following script to upload everything to archive.org:\n#!/bin/sh\nBASE_URL=http://archive.org/details/\nBASE_HEADER=something-$(date -u +%s) #something that should be unique\necho Converts to PDF and uploads the contents of a directory given as the command-line argument.\necho Now converting PDF to JPG\nfor file in `ls $1/*.pdf`\ndo\n   convert $file `echo $file | sed 's/\\.pdf$/\\.jpg/'`\ndone\necho Listing JPGs: #make sure the conversion worked\nls $1/*.jpg\necho Making the bucket...\ns3cmd mb s3://$BASE_HEADER\necho Sleeping...#sometimes it takes a moment to be processed on their end\nsleep 20\necho Uploading files...\nfor file in `ls $1`\ndo\n        s3cmd put $1/$file s3://$BASE_HEADER/$file\ndone\necho $BASE_URL$BASE_HEADER\n\nIt's run like upload.sh ~/stuff/\n", "Q: Using Alt + Keycode for accents? In Windows, we can use Alt+Keycode (for example, 130) to get an e acute, but it does not work this way in Ubuntu/Debian.\nIs it possible to have the same keycodes work in Ubuntu?\n\nA: First hold Ctrl+Shift, then tap U and let go.\nAn underlined \"u\" will appear, to which you can append a combination of characters. Hit enter after that and the new character will appear.\nFor instance, if I hold Ctrl+Shift and hit U, type e+9, then hit enter, an é appears. If I hit e+8 instead, an è does instead.\nYou can find the correct combinations using the Character Map program in Accessories. The first \"0\" or two that you find on certain entries can be dropped (e.g. a ç is listed as 00E7, but you only need to type the e7).\nIt's a bit odd coming from using the Alt method in Windows, but you'll acclimate quickly.\nN.B.: If you need to frequently type many types of accented characters see Adam Byrtek's answer below for a nice method that, while it requires some setting up, can save a lot of time in the long run.\n\nA: Configure the compose key, press it to enter the compose mode and type e' to get \"é\". The mappings are very intuitive, so you don't have to learn them by heart. For example, it's easy to infer that in order to get \"ü\" you should type u\" in the compose mode.\n", "Q: Are x11 bitmapped fonts necessary? Are the x11 100 and 75 dpi fonts absolutely necessary?\nIf Ubuntu has TrueType support, (as well as OpenType) why do I need all those bit-mapped fonts hanging around?\nCan I delete them?  (and/or generate ttf/ot versions for those I want to keep)\nIf I delete those fonts, will some ancient primitive packages still be looking for them and crash, or will I just get a substituted system default?\nI've already read this topic: What fonts are absolutely required?\nAnswers were not really informative enough and kind of vague.  I'm hoping my questions are more specific so I get a more definitive idea of just what the font system requires and does not.\n\nA: All modern GTK+ applications use Xft for font rendering. Xorg bitmap fonts are installed by default just for the sake of backward compatibility. In other words you can safely uninstall them if you don't use any legacy applications (eg. gitk).\n\nA: The X server requires exactly two fonts, fixed and cursor, both of which are builtin to all recent versions of the libXfont library it uses.\nMany older X applications however, may have specified those fonts - generally they'll fallback to using a default like fixed, but that may be missing some characters, and will probably be at a different size, thus leading to a different (sometimes broken) layout of menus, buttons, and other widgets spaced for the expected font/size.\n", "Q: What new features does GTK+3.0 introduce? And how will it improve other GTK themes such as Ambiance or Elementary?\n\nA: The GTK+ 3 release notes gave the basics of it.\nGTK+ 3.x will not directly change/improve themes like Ambiance, in fact, most of these themes won't work as yet, as they have to be ported.\nHowever, you can expect to see some improvements all around as things progress with GTK+ 3.x.\n*This answer is now outdated, and needs an update.\n\nA: \nGTK+ 3 is a major new version of GTK+, containing far too many changes to list them all here. The major highlights include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Cairo drawing throughout. GDK no longer wraps the antiquated   X11 drawing API; we've made a clean break and exclusively rely   on cairo\n  for all our drawing needs now. This has also enabled us   to remove\n  several other X11-centric concepts such as GCs, colormaps   and\n  pixmaps.\n  \n*Modern input device handling. The input device handling in GDK has   long been a sadly neglected area. This has changed; with 3.0, GTK+ steps into the modern world of XI2 with full support for multiple pointers, keyboards and other gizmos.\n  \n*A new theming API which sports a familiar CSS syntax for theme   configuration and other improvements such as animated state transitions.\n  \n*More flexible geometry management, with support for height-for-width,   for both widgets and cell renderers.\n  \n*Multiple backend support for GDK. With GTK+ 2.x, you had to recompile   your application to have it work with a different GDK backend.   In GTK+ 3, multiple GDK backends can be built into a single library   and selected at runtime.\n  \n*Easy application support. With the integration of D-Bus support in   GIO, we could finally add a GtkApplication class that handles a lot of the platform integration aspects of writing an application, such as keeping track of open windows, ensuring uniqueness, exporting actions, etc.\n  \n*Of course, there's some new widgets as well, such as a switch and   an application chooser.\n\nSource: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2011-February/msg00022.html\n", "Q: What would make a font available for desktop options, but not in an app like LibreOffice? I've installed the TrueType version of the Lucida Grande font from my Mac.  It seems to show up fine when setting desktop options for screen, system, document, menu, titlebar, etc.\nHowever, it will not show up in the font list in LibreOffice for anything.\nI've rebuilt the font cache several times.  Any other font works for both just fine, just not this one.\nAny ideas as to what would cause this?\n\nA: Assuming the font was place in one of the folders the font cache looks in, i.e. ~/.fonts, the only thing I can suggest is a reboot. That may be required for LibreOffice to recognize the updated font cache.\n\nA: Proportional True Type fonts are turned off by default\nGo to Tools -> Options -> Fonts where you will see:\n\nRemove the check mark beside Non-proportional fonts only then click OK button. Now many more fonts will available for you including the ones you just installed that were missing.\n\nPermissions are important\nEnsure your font directory has the correct permissions:\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/<font_dir>\n\nEnsure files in the font directory have the correct permissions:\nsudo chmod 644 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/<font_dir>/*\n\nSource: [Solved] Barcode Fonts on Linux not visible\n", "Q: How do I enable Video Chat in Empathy for MSN and Yahoo? Video Chat is always greyed out in Empathy (Yahoo and MSN contacts have the same issue) (2.32.1), however, video chat in Skype (Beta) Works 100% perfectly. \n\nA: According to the Empathy FAQ it only works with certain protocols:\n\nCurrently for SIP/XMPP/Gtalk. MSN support is currently broken due to change Microsoft has done to their server, see this blog post for more detail.\n\n", "Q: Nautilus icon missing (after uninstalling Macbuntu 10.10 customization pack) After using Macbuntu 10.10 theme for a while, I uninstalled it using supplied uninstall.sh file, and now Nautilus icon is missing, and none of the icon theme is showing it. I also found that the launcher of Nautilus i.e. nautilus-browser.desktop is missing in /usr/share/applications/ folder.

I notice in the demo video of uTouch that the standard mouse pointer is still showing. Are there plans to remove the mouse cursor? \nThis is one of the most annoying things when using touch technology on PC tablets. This was also my issue with the Android port for PC. People with touch screen device's don't want an annoying cursor to show anywhere on the screen because, it's distracting. Touch technology needs to seem natural and allow the user to interact with objects on the screen much like objects in the physical world. Don't get me wrong, I love Ubuntu and that is all I run on my PC's. However when you see a 2 or 3 year old using an Apple iPad without having to be taught to interface with it, you know you have designed a great UI experience.\nIt's great to see this coming into reality on Ubuntu keep up the good work.\nAre their plans to make Ubuntu\\uTouch more natural for touch device users?\n\nA: See this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/660613/how-do-you-hide-the-mouse-pointer-under-linux-x11\nIt looks like there are no plans to do anything about this issue, if you would like it to have some attention, please report it as a bug: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs\n", "Q: Manually installing Python 2.6? Ubuntu 8.04 comes with Python 2.5 and no 2.6 package support in the apt-get ecosystem. Searching around I found http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/10/installing-python-26-source-ubuntu-hardy/ and all went well except I got a few more missing modules than the article reports;\nFailed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:\n_bsddb             bsddb185           dbm             \ndl                 imageop            sunaudiodev     \nTo find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.\n\nIm pretty sure i want/need dl. I know it's deprecated starting with 2.6, but it should still be there.\nOverall Im finding it very difficult to get 2.6 installed. I would ideally like to replace it (point /usr/bin/python at 2.6) but looking in 2.5 site-packages and seeing symlinks to a 'pyshared' directory, etc. makes me fear that things will break terribly.\nI also tried to setup a virtualenv on another, 2.6 capable machine and copied over the virtualenv but it cannot execute the python binary.... idunno. \nIm really just trying to get 2.6 installed to run a Django project. Nothing more, so it doesn't have to replace the system python but if it can work, it'd be nice.\n\nA: This was solved by simply downloading the 2.6 release from python.org and installing it along side 2.5 (/usr/lib/python2.6/) and symlinking /usr/bin/python to python2.6. A few modules were reported missing during the build process but ignoring them didn't seem to break anything (that i needed, anyway).\n\nA: This doesn't exactly answer your question but there appears to be a backport of Python 2.6 in this PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~python-dev/+archive/ppa/+packages\nThough it has not been updated in quite some time but might get you what you need with less hassle.\n", "Q: Unable to install ubuntu desktop guest using KVM I'm unable to install ubuntu 10.10amd64 (or i386) onto a ubuntu amd64 server running KVM.

Then the panel completely disappeared.\n\nA: So it turns out that the Ubuntu 10.10 desktop installer requires at least 512MB memory (according to some forum posts, I was unable to find an official system requirements page) and the 256MB I was giving the VM just wasn't cutting it.\n", "Q: Finding corrupted images Are there any good Ubuntu/Debian/Linux-based tools for identifying corrupted jpeg images in a collection of tens of thousands?

The commands I'd need would be:\n- find files in current folder named note* (and not ending in .txt) and rename them as note*.txt\n- move files named note*.txt to /home/username/notes\n\nUnfortunately I don't know how to put it in script form so I'm asking for help.\n\nA: This might get you started:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfind . -name 'note*' -not -name '*txt' -exec mv -bf '{}' '{}'.txt \\;\nfind . -name 'note*.txt' -exec mv -bf '{}' /home/username/notes/ \\;\n\nThe -bf makes mv not asking questions and backup if overwriting.\n\nA: Open up a terminal, and open up a text editor using this command (gedit, or your favourite!)\n\ngedit ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Notes\n\nThis will open up a file in the Nautilus (file browser) Scripts folder for some magic that you will see soon :D\n\nNow copy the following simplified code into gedit and save.

How can i change the runlevel in ubuntu 10.04 or 10.10\nAs far as I can recall ubuntu changed the runlevel with something else?\nIf I want to change the start to terminal only and not X what and r\n\nA: To make Ubuntu boot directly to console and not X, you have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/default/grub in your favorite text editor as root (e.g. gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub)\n\n*Locate the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\n\n*Replace \"quiet splash\" with \"text\" (i.e., GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\").

I have tar 1.22 installed and I need tar 1.20. I tried:\nsudo apt-get install tar=1.20\n\nbut I got:\n\nVersion '1.20' for 'tar' was not found\n\nWhen I looked more closely it turned out that the current version is not just 1.22, but 1.22-2ubuntu1. So I tried:\nsudo apt-get install tar=1.20-2ubuntu1\n\nBut still got the that error message.\nAny idea how do I install tar 1.20 on my Ubuntu?\n\nA: Hardy, the long term version from 2008 has 1.19. I know it is not the same as 1.20 but I guess it is the closest you can get using canonicals blessed bits. Try to download the three files from the right side of this page: http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/tar and use dpkg-buildpackage to make a package suitable for your distribution. After that, you need to force the installation with dpkg -f -i because you're probably downgrading.\nI am left wondering why would you do such a thing. Is 1.22 giving you a hard time?\n\nA: If it is not in the repositories and you can't find any PPA for it then you'll have to build from source.\nYou can get the source here.\n\nA: You should try sudo apt-get install tar=1.22-2ubuntu1, rather than sudo apt-get install tar=1.20-2ubuntu1, because those are different versions.  Note that the latest version may not be included in the repositories for your version of Ubuntu, in which case, get the source from the link given by Octavian here, and you can then build it from source.\n", "Q: How to uninstall compizconfig? I setup the compizconfig, but I find I don't like it.\nand my terminal cant use Ctrl + Shift + c or Ctrl + Shift + v since I setup the compizconfig?\nSo how to uninstall it?\n\nA: Can't you just do -  \nsudo apt-get remove compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\nA: This is what i used when i had a problem with it.\nOr you could use:\nsudo apt-get remove compiz-fusion-plugins-extra\nsudo apt-get remove compiz-plugins-extra\nsudo apt-get purge compiz*\n\nThen to Re-install use:\nsudo apt-get install unity-2d\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop-2d\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xgl\nsudo apt-get install emerald\nsudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra\nsudo apt-get install git compiz-plugins-extra\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\n", "Q: Naming conventions: apachectl, and configuration: do you think this is correct? The batch script to restart the httpd server is called apache2.\nApache is a group of volunteers who do far more than just an http server.\nCalling the script apache2 (apachectl is apache2ctl and so on) is very, very restrictive.\nHow about keeping everything \"homogeneous\"? The configuration file is, on every distro httpd.conf. Not in Ubuntu. And a lot of stuff like this concerning the Apache \"httpd server\" configuration / installation. What's the point?\n\nA: I guess there is a case to be made for a name change. But the historical reason for calling it apache is still stronger.\nThis is one of those things you can't change without upsetting a ton of people.\nUbuntu may have started such a convention years ago, or it may have inherited it from the debian folks. But the fact is that now everybody knows such convention in ubuntusphere. It is different in redhatsphere for example. Neither can change its convention since it would break third party scripts, monitoring tools, watchdogs and other not-so-well-written stuff; not to mention stress and confusion to the not-so-eager-to-read-the-release-notes section of the corporate IT crowd.\nThat's just the life in the city ;-)\n\nA: While the Apache Software Foundation develops a number of tools, the flagship project is still the Apache web server.  It likely gets a relatively small slice of the efforts now. The other projects have other names, and are installed using those names.\nDebian/Ubuntu use http.conf as the base configuration file.  This is extended using include mechanisms to provide a more flexible modular configuration system.  This allows for configuration files with high cohesion, and minimal coupling.\nA similar argument would apply to installing ubuntu-minimal, which should be host-minimal or server-minimal by your convention.  I believe ubuntu-minimal is a better convention. \nEDIT: The distribution needs to support the least common denominator (single configuration file).  They have done a good job of sectioning the configuration file so that it easy to split for environments which allow separation of concerns in the their configuration such as Debian/Ubuntu.  They also support the use of include files so that users can do their own splitting if they choose.  \nUsing a single http.conf file for multiple virtual hosts is prone to errors where changes are done to the wrong virtual host.  It is also difficult to disable a particular vhost.  Using the split configuration reduces likelyhood of error and makes things like disabling, enabling, or adding vhosts relatively trivial.  Having a standard split configuration makes it easier for administrators moving from one system to another.\nRetaining the original http.conf file as an empty included file accomplishes two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It indicates that the server is there and the configuration has been split/moved elsewhere.  \n\n*Allows tools which do their configuration by adding to the http.conf file to configure themselves.\n\n", "Q: How can i change the top right corner display Name? I have changed the name on /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts but the top right corner display name won't change \n\nHow can i change that name? \n\nA: /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts contains your hostname (the computer name). The name next to the shutdown button is your username.\nChanging your username just to get a different name displayed is not recommended. To make your actual name to be displayed instead of your username, open a Terminal and run:\ngconftool -s /system/indicator/me/display --type int 2\n\n(taken from fluteflute's answer)\nTo change your actual username (which defaults to your username), go to System -> Administration -> Users and Groups. Select your user and click the \"Change...\" button after your current name. Enter whatever you like and press OK to save it. You'll need to re-login to make the name change take effect.\n\nA: From the terminal;\nchfn -f \"FirstName LastName\" *username*\n\nverify with;\ngetent passwd $USER | cut -d ':' -f 5 | cut -d ',' -f 1\n\nOR\nfinger -m $USER | head -n 1 | sed 's/\\(.*\\)Name\\:\\s\\(.*\\)$/\\2/g'\n\n", "Q: How can I recover my Empathy Internet messaging keyring password?

I haven't noticed this dot in any other application.\nThe dot is visible on the picture to the left of the 'F' in \"File\":\n\n\nA: Are you using Unity?\nCould you provide a larger screenshot that includes the whole left of the screen?\nIt might be the small \"arrow\" bullet that appears and points to the application's launcher icon, or an artefact of it.\n", "Q: What's the name of PPA? (for ppa-purge) I'm testing PPAs, so I commonly use ppa-purge, that restores my default versions. But I always have problem with the ppa name. What do I need to put as argument for ppa-purge?\nI always used my browser to check name on launchpad, but what about when I'm without internet and I can't start X. Org server?\nFor xorg-edgers I know that ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa what about others? Let's say, I know that I have PPA of X-Updates. How do I find out the name of this PPA so I could use with ppa-purge, without using browser\nSo the name should be something like ppa:NAME/ppa? How to get this NAME?\n\nA: This command will list all the PPA repositories you have configured\ngrep ppa /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*\n\nAlternatively, you can check the repository of a given package\napt-cache policy [package-name]\n\n\nA: I recommend using \"Y PPA Manager\" which has (among others) one nifty feature: it can list all packages from a ppa enabled on your computer.\n", "Q: Is it better to upgrade through the Update Manager or re-install from scratch? I' m running 10.10 and I would like to upgrade to 11.04 as it hits Beta. Would performance be better with an installation through running the upgrade script or with a fresh install after a format?\n\nA: In my experience, a fresh install is often better. Most of the packages you've installed either by synaptic, though the Ubuntu Software Center or by .debs will have been packaged specifically for your previous version, the scripts don't always take account of this, and it occasionally mess up those apps.\nI find having a seperate /home partition for keeping your often used files is an excellent solution for not having to reinstall all your data with clean installs.\nFor more advice on how to do this, go to here.\n\nA: The method you choose doesn't have any impact on system performance. Both are fine, the question is whether you want to start from a clean slate or not.\n\nA: I tried a couple of times to do an actual upgrade, and always had major issues, which I did not have when I was trying the live version. This was telling me that something went wrong when upgrading. AS a general rule, I now do not upgrade, but rather install the brand new distro. A couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not want to re-download all your files for the latest DEB packages, that may not be the most recent ones from the ISO, copy all of those form the /var/ directory. There is an actual utility that will backup all the DEB files you had installed, and will restore them. You still have to install them, but tis would save you some download time. This would also apply to applications that are not part of the main distro, but that you want to install. The latest DEB file will likely be readily available to you. \n\n*backup your /home directory completely. If it was not at first installed in its own partition, I would recommend doing so in your new install. Later installations can then only point to this directory, saving you time and efforts of file transfer.\n\nA: Personally, in Natty beta, i was unable to use the downloaded iso to install. Ubiqity always ended in a IO error and left the drive unusable. However, i solved this by freshly nstalling 10.10 and immediatlly upgrading with the -d flag. This worked perfectly and i havent had alot of crashes. \n", "Q: How Can I Get Urdu Fonts? How can I use Urdu fonts in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You must enable IBus..

I have more than 60 to 80 systems running Ubuntu. Some of them are with version 8.04 and some of them are with latest version 10.10. Now we are in the process of upgrading all older Ubuntu version to a newer version. It is difficult to switch on every Ubuntu system and taking notes of older Ubuntu version and then upgrade. I have IP addresses of all these machines in a text a file. So I am looking for a simple bash script which will automate the task. I am expecting the output would look like this:\n172.29.34.40 ubuntu 10.04\n172.29.34.41 ubuntu 8.04\n172.29.34.42 ubuntu 8.10        \nand so on.. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: You can get the Ubuntu version using\n$ lsb_release -s -d\nUbuntu 10.04.1 LTS\n\nIf you want to automate that, write a Bash script that reads list of hosts from stdin and executes the command over SSH. Something like\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile read host; do\n   echo -n \"$host: \"\n   ssh \"$host\" lsb_release -s -d < /dev/null\ndone\n\nIf you have one common user account on all the machines you want to connect to then this should be what you are looking for\n#!/bin/bash\nRUSER=\"username\"\nwhile read host; do\n   echo -n \"$host: \"\n   ssh \"$RUSER@$host\" lsb_release -s -d < /dev/null\ndone\n\nSave it as versions.sh, remembering to make it executable (chmod a+x versions.sh), and execute\n$ versions.sh < ips.txt\n\n\nA: Assuming they are running SSH servers, you could try to guess Ubuntu versions based on the package version of SSH:\n$ nc IP.IP.IP.IP 22\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.5p1 Debian-4ubuntu5\nCtrl-C\n\nCurrent versions of openssh are listed in Launchpad https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/openssh:\nopenssh | 1:4.2p1-7ubuntu3.5 | dapper-updates/main\nopenssh | 1:4.7p1-8ubuntu3   | hardy-updates/main\nopenssh | 1:5.1p1-6ubuntu2   | karmic/main\nopenssh | 1:5.3p1-3ubuntu6   | lucid-updates/main\nopenssh | 1:5.5p1-4ubuntu5   | maverick-updates/main\nopenssh | 1:5.8p1-1ubuntu2   | natty/main\n\nSo in my above example, 5.5p1 with a Debian version of -4ubuntu5 looks to be an Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick system.\nSome servers may have \"DebianBanner no\" in their /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, but the upstream version of OpenSSH is still visible which is sufficient to identify the system still (each release of Ubuntu so far has a different upstream version of OpenSSH).\n", "Q: Specifying X windows' geometry in the coordinates obtained from  wmctrl In the X documentation I read that the Width, Height, Xposition and Yposition coordinates must be specified in terminal characters when using:\ngnome-terminal --geometry=WidthxHeight+Xposition+Yposition \nIf I use as input coordinates those that I get from a wmctrl -lG output (not sure if wmctrl uses pixels, terminal characters or something different as geometrical units), I don't get the expected results. I.e. the geometry coordinates output by wmctrl -lG and the ones a user can specify with gnome-terminal --geometry turn out to be different.\nIs there anything I am doing wrong? Any thoughts?\nThanks\n\nA: The --geometry option for gnome-terminal is actually measured in characters, rather than pixels. For example, to get an 80 column terminal only 10 lines high, you can launch gnome-terminal like this:\ngnome-terminal --geometry 80x10\n\nThe terminal will resize in increments of the font character size, which it communicates to the Xserver using WM_NORMAL_HINTS. You can examine these using the xprop command. For example, here I find a Terminal window id, and ask xprop about it:\n$ wmctrl -lG | tail -n1\n0x06400021  0 592  314  580  338  myhostname kees@myhostname: ~\n$ xprop -id 0x6400021\n...\nWM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):\n        program specified minimum size: 48 by 16\n        program specified resize increment: 7 by 14\n        program specified base size: 20 by 2\n        window gravity: NorthWest\n...\n\nIn the above case, the font size is 7 by 14 pixels. So if I wanted a 70 by 140 pixel Terminal, I could run gnome-terminal --geometry 10x10 (though it would be 20 x 2 pixels larger than that based on the window manager decorations, etc, as seen in the \"specific base size\" above).\n\nA: The command gnome-terminal --geometry 80x10 does not work in Ubuntu.\nYou must use a = after geometry, not a space: gnome-terminal --geometry=80x10+10+10\n\nA: In Ubuntu 21.10 I've found it does seem to be pixel-based not character-based, although uhhh virtual pixels not literal pixels (I'm using a 4k monitor but I have 2x scaling turned on in Screen Display, and I'm giving the geometry as if 1080p)\nand I found that there were issues where it would jump down and shrink if I made it the full 1080 pixels, due to the status bar, and in practice there seems to be a couple pixels of extra border needed.\nso my command for launching two terminals that together fill my lower monitor ends up looking like this (958 instead of 960, and 1028 instead of 1080 (to account for the status bar)\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=Node --geometry=958x1028+0+1080 -- bash & \ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=Git --geometry=958x1028+960+1080 -- bash\n\n", "Q: Is there any useful software for filling out pdf-forms other than Adobe Reader?

This is true for both Ubuntu kernel modules in other packages, and for third party modules.\nNote that even though it's the 4th number in a set of numbers near the kernel version, it does not have anything to do with the \"bug fix\" serial number used by the upstream version. To see which \"bug fix\" serial number a given Ubuntu kernel is based on, see the contents of /proc/version_signature:\n$ cat /proc/version_signature \nUbuntu 2.6.32-30.59-server 2.6.32.29+drm33.13\n\nIn this case, it is upstream's 2.6.32.29 kernel, with Ubuntu patches. It is the Ubuntu kernel's 30th ABI revision, and 59th upload of the 2.6.32-based upstream kernel.\nTo see the changes between kernel (or any) package versions, see /usr/share/doc/NAME-OF-PACKAGE/changelog.Debian.gz. For example:\n$ zless /usr/share/doc/linux-image-$(uname -r)/changelog.Debian.gz\n...\n\n", "Q: Touchpad Two-finger Scroll Configuration This all started with me trying to get 2-finger scroll working. In Windows, I got used to it. So I found a thread that said to run these commands:\nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\nsynclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=1\nsynclient EmulateTwoFingerMinW=5\nsynclient EmulateTwoFingerMinZ=48\n\nIt kinda worked, when I put one finger extremely close to the other. So another thread said to fine-tune the MinW and MinZ by doing synclient -m 150, where I got the error \"Can't access shared memory area. SHMConfig disabled?\"\nSo I set off to enable SHM Config. I found another post that said to edit my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and add Option          \"SHMConfig\"             \"on\" - so that's in there, and I still get that error.

What has gone wrong with the Ubuntu startup page? it look of it has changed so far and in stead of Google being on the left it is on the right with Google custom search. I try to type something into it but it won't let me search. I want to keep it on that as a home page because I heard Canonical gets a little change when you search with the default homepage.\n\n\nA: Just go to http://start.ubuntu.com/current/ and set it as your home page.  \nIn Firefox: Edit/Preferences/General/ and click the 'Use current page' button.\n\nA: Do you use Firefox 5 or later? Google doesn't provide it's Toolbar any longer, take a look at this entry. You could add the Ubuntu Startpage search to the search box of Firefox. Thus you are able to search directly without revisiting about:startpage.\nI recommend to install the Firefox Addon Add to Search Bar. Then restart Firefox. Go to about:startpage, rightclick into the search field and choose \"Add to Search Bar\".\n\nThen you can enter a custom name for that search, choose an icon and a keyword (optional).\n\nThe new search appears immediately in the search box. It uses the same settings/strings like the one on Ubuntus startpage.\n\n\nA: I cannot recall a source for this off-hand, but I think I read that searching using the search box in Firefox also achieves the same effect. If you notice the search page URL after searching using the search bar, you'll find it adds 'ubuntu' as referral client.\nEdit: I may be wrong about this. The search bar referral revenues could be going to Mozilla instead.\n", "Q: Cannot enable desktop effects using open source ati drivers I am using the open source ATI drivers in Ubuntu 10.10 because I cannot sleep with the proprietary ones (the machine enters suspend, but will not resume).

Is there a way to clear up what is displayed on the shell console (in ubuntu linux) in just a single key or two? When I get flood of lines from grep and that exceeds the height of the window, I want to quickly scroll back to the position where I typed the command after the prompt. I can do so if I had opened a fresh terminal before I type the command, and just go to the initial position. But if keep using the same terminal window, I have to manually find the position. Ctrl+l is not an answer because it just scrolls, and the contents of the terminal remains. I cannot use less because the colored output of grep does not show up.\n\nA: If the console gets jammed/full then:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset will clear and reset the state.  You can also cause this to be sent via the magic sequence Ctrl-v Esc c Enter\n\n*clear if you just want to clear the screen; you might combine it with the output you're after: clear ; grep -r …\n(BTW, reboot is a separate command, so don't worry about accidentally rebooting your machine by using clear or reset!).\n\nA: You can actually stick with using less - try this:\ngrep --color=always foo * | less -r\n\nThat will tell grep to ignore that its output is being piped, and the \"-r\" on less tells it to pass through raw control characters, which in this case are the color codes.\n", "Q: HDMI sound doesn't work on an Asus EEE I installed Ubuntu-Netbook remix to Asus EEE series.

There is TWO option called \"toggle fullscreen mode\" and \"toggle maximizing state\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Especially for \"toggle fullscreen mode\", the applications remain THE SAME with all the toolbars & such and the screen will hide your top panel and the launcher also\n\n\nI use that as a \"so-called\" & \"low tech\" solution \n\nA: Do you have multitouch cabable touchpad?\nIf so. There are two default actions to hide / show the launcher in Ubuntu.\nfour finger swipe to the right (show launcher)\nfour finger swipe to the left (hide launcher)\n", "Q: Is there a way to serve a VM located on a server to clients? Here's my situation:\nI have two ASUS Celeron 800mhz 512MB systems that are currently running XP SP3.  Our POS system is Windows only, and will NOT run in Wine. (well, it runs, but not functionally)  I have other machines running Ubuntu with VMWare Player hosting XP as a virtual machine for the POS.  No issues there.\nBut these two older systems don't have enough ram to run even Puppy Linux and XP in a virtual machine, much less Ubuntu or Xubuntu with the VM. (and they cannot be upgraded)\nPresently, my option seems to be (other than sticking with very slow XP systems) to try to create a stripped down custom XP to fit it into less memory so I can run it in Xubuntu or Puppy in a VM.\nWhat I would \"like\" to do, is run Xubuntu (or Puppy) and serve the whole VM over the LAN.\nI thought maybe a thin-client setup was the ticket, but I don't want to serve the whole Linux OS if I can help it.  These desktops still need to run LibreOffice, FireFox, and Thunderbird.  So I'd like to just serve up the VM to each. Also, it is quite possible, to have both desktops trying to run the POS simultaneously, so I'll need separate instances of the VM for each client, if not each user on them.\nI don't mind if the VM/POS is a little slow.  But the main desktop needs to be reasonably responsive for other tasks, hence why I want to switch these two to Linux.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Since you're already using VMware, you might want to look into the VSphere hypervisor. You can use it to run multiple VMs on a single server in headless mode, and serve them across the network to clients. We use it at my college to run target VMs for penetration testing competitions.\n", "Q: Headphones phones don't work on my Toshiba Satellite L655d-S5066 laptop I'm using a toshiba satellite L655d-S5066 my headphones don't work is there a way to fix them using ubuntu or is this a sacrifice to use ubuntu. \n\nA: I found this fix and it worked on the Toshiba Satellite L655D-S5066\nEasiest way:\nOpen a terminal.\nType:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nPress enter and it will ask for your password.\nIn gedit, add:\noptions snd-hda-intel model=ideapad\n\nto the bottom of the file and save it.

I use openbox as my window manager and run neither the KDE nor Gnome desktop stacks.  I haven't yet figured out how to get the system to hibernate when low on battery power, so I get occasional power outages.\nI've noticed that when my laptop switches over to battery power, my ext* partitions are remounted with the option commit=600.\nWhen I switch back to AC, there is another set of remounts with commit=0.\nThis is apparent from entries in /var/log/syslog like\nMar 31 14:48:48 gatsby kernel: [414710.189306] EXT4-fs (dm-0): re-mounted. Opts: errors=remount-ro,commit=600\nMar 31 14:48:48 gatsby kernel: [414710.324137] EXT4-fs (dm-1): re-mounted.

Opts: commit=0\n\nThe mount manual explains the meaning of the count option with respect to the ext3 filesystem thusly:\ncommit=nrsec\n       Sync all data and metadata every nrsec seconds.\n       The default value is 5 seconds. Zero means default.\n\nWhat does this mean, exactly?  It seems to imply that writes may be cached for up to 10 minutes.  Does this mean that there could be filesystem corruption, or that some changes may go unsaved if my battery power runs out?\n\nA: It shouldn't result in file system corruption (it is a journaling file system, after all), but it may result in lost work.\nThe reason for the behaviour is that spinning up the disk uses power, and by waiting longer before performing a journal commit it may be possible to perform multiple writes in one go, resulting in fewer spin ups and better battery life.\nIf this is causing problems for you, you can alter the commit interval when on battery.  The changes are performed by the pm-utils package, so create a file under /etc/pm/config.d/ (the name doesn't matter) with the following contents:\nJOURNAL_COMMIT_TIME_BAT=300\n\nThe above sets the timeout to 5 minutes.  You can tweak it as needed.\n", "Q: Cannot Log in to Ubuntu I have a Dual Boot-up with Windows 7 Ultimate and Ubuntu.\nMy Ubuntu 10.10 does not allow me to log in and says that the GNOME power manager \nhas not been installed properly & asks me to contact the system administrator.\nHowever I'm sure that the my password is correct,because it worked perfectly fine until yesterday.How can I rectify this?\n\nA: If you have a live cd, boot from this, and run a disk check on the ubuntu partition.\nTo do this, you need to first run fdisk -l from a root terminal, then once you know the location of the ubuntu partition, run fsck /path/to_drive.\nOnce the disk check is complete, you can restart your system (without the CD) and it should be working again.\n", "Q: Simplest way to swap esc key with ` key What is the simplest way to swap the functionality of the Esc key and the ` key?\nSystem ➜ Preferences ➜Keyboard ➜ Layouts ➜ Options let me swap my Ctrl key and Capslock key, which was good, but it doesn't seem to let me do other keys in a generalized way.\nThe xmodmap answer that got accepted here was useful. Now my ` key is on the physical Esc key, and vice versa. The problem is that when I Shift+Esc I still only get a ` when I'd like to get a tilde.\n\nA: You want to follow the five-point list of instructions on the ubuntuforums by Andy Meier:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10286878#post10286878\nThe keys you'd have to modify in your /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/mynewlayout would be:\nkey <ESC>  {[ quoteleft,    asciitilde      ]       };\nkey <TLDE> {[ escape      ]       };\nYou then have to register this new layout as described on the forum.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Xmodmap replaces keycodes. shift+esc is not a different key. Check the output of xev when you press a and shift+a. You'll find the state changes from 0x0 to 0x1 while the keycode stays the same. What you want to do is change the definition of a key, not just tack on the A/a or ~/` keys. Redefining the output of key's state change is outside the scope of xmodmap.\nI don't know exactly how to do what you want, but I think creating a keyboard definition is the right way. I'll edit with more help if or when I figure out how to do this. Maybe this will set you on the right path.\n\nA: I read elsewhere that Ubuntu is no longer using xmodmap. It's using xkb instead. There's some info on that in this post: \nPermanent xmodmap in Ubuntu 13.04\nHowever, I'm still using 12.04LTS, and I wanted to swap my Esc and grave keys. I did it with xmodmap and it worked.\nI created a small script that runs xmodmap and I have that script run when I login. The xmodmap commands are:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 49 = Escape\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 9 = grave asciitilde\"\n\nI don't know if this solution will work in versions of Ubuntu newer than 12.04.\n", "Q: How to copy/share AWN settings?

Other problem, shadows are printed horizontally even though the text is vertical, you can see \"14\" ad \"Fri\" shadows in dark behind the vertical text.\nIs it a known bug? If not, how to fix it?\n\nA: If you use Ubuntu 10.10, to fix Ambiance, run the following command:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/apps/gnome-panel.rc\n\nAnd comment line 10 which looks like this: \"bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"img/panel.png\"\". To comment means to add a \"#\" sign in front of the line (without the quotes). After editing the file, the line should look like this:\n# bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"img/panel.png\"\n\nIt's the same for Radiance (but replace \"Ambiance\" with \"Radiance\" in the command above).\nIn Ubuntu 10.04, the file you need to edit is the \"gtkrc\" file inside the gtkrc-2.0 folder.\nFurther info: \"Fix\" The Gnome Panel For Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Ambiance And Radiance Themes\n\nA: In the deafult theme, the panel uses an image as the background.

This was with the default Ambiance theme in 10.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*EDIT - I just tried the other method and it looks better. A problem remains though. There looks to be a 'drop shadow' of the text that remains horizontal while the lighter text switches to a vertical orientation. You can see this on the OP's image, too.

We have the boot loader display an aubergine background (we wanted to have an Ubuntu logo as well, but there are problems with different aspect ratios between the boot loader and the real system, so this is the next best thing).  vt.handoff=7 then causes the kernel to maintain the current contents of video memory on virtual terminal 7, which is a new \"transparent\" VT type.  The first time that the kernel is told to switch away from VT 7, either from Plymouth or manually (Alt-F1, etc.), these contents are lost and VT 7 reverts to text mode.\nThe upshot is that, when everything is working correctly, you get an aubergine background on the way out of the boot loader, then at some point Plymouth displays a logo and a progress indicator on top of that, and then the display manager comes up and smoothly replaces that with a login prompt.\nAlso, you asked about the search command in GRUB.

I just recall running it from the LiveCD before installation, after which point I switched over to OpenBox from gnome and haven't looked at the menu system since.\nMarco's answer mentions the laptop testing tracker, which seems like it could be a front end to this hypothetical DB.  However, there are currently only a few reports on that page.\nIs this something we can expect to see made available in the near future?  Are collected test results available at a different page/site?  It would be a tremendously beneficial resource for the community.\n\nA: The tool is called Checkbox.  A new crowd-sourced \"Ubuntu Friendly Hardware\" program was recently announced, but I don't know if it will integrate with Checkbox.\nhttp://victorpalau.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/introducing-ubuntu-friendly/\n", "Q: How to Bind to Static IP address in MySQL I have an Ubuntu server and I've installed MySQL.  How would I use my two physical static IP addresses in my.cnf bind-address -- can I add two IP addresses?\n\nA: Only one address can be specified, but you can set bind-address to  0.0.0.0 in order to make MySQL listen on all available interfaces.\n\nA: As Adam said, use bind-address = 0.0.0.0 to get MySQL to listen to all IP addresses. This will ensure that it listens to bnoth static IP's you've got on the box.\nIf you have more than 2 static IP's and don't want MySQL listening on those ports, install a Firewall on your box and block off port 3306 to all but the two IP's you want using MySQL. That way your firewall handles the access control rather than MySQL.\nHere is a \"little\" guide to set up the firewall:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/10055164/connection-to-mysql-server-in-syn-sent\nJust look at the second part with the answer.\n", "Q: Getting a problem with Cardapio and Gajim, won't launch due to a locale problem?

I installed ubuntu on a spare HDD and use GRUB to select my OS, Vista or Ubuntu. \nI cannot remember my ubuntu password for the life of me. If I reinstall ubuntu could that destroy my ability to launch Vista?\nI plan on reinstalling via live CD unless there is an easier way.\n\nA: You don't need to reinstall just select the recovery mode from grub then select the root shell option from the recovery menu and use the adduser command to add another user (for more on this look at the man page)\n\nA: It shouldn't.  If vista is already installed GRUB will pick it up again.  The only problem I have ever had with bootloaders is installing windows after linux.  But, to be safe I would download and burn supergrub or some form of bootloader live cd incase something goes wrong. \nI would go here and download the iso there, just incase something goes wrong.  I've done several multiboots though, and never had an issue.  The disks I linked too have solved all my problems with Grub in the past automagically.  Just read the descriptions and they'll point you in the right direction.\n\nA: Instead of adding another user, as Reuben suggested, you can just change the password for your existing user and keep all settings:\nSelect recovery mode from grub, start into a root shell and then use the following command:\npasswd <username>\n\nThis will allow you to reset the password of your existing user.\n", "Q: Configuring my router I need to configure my router so I can access the website I have running on my computer from the outside world.\nHow can I do this?  I think I need to open the port 80 on the router, which gets forwarded to a specific ip address i.e. 192.168.1.200.\nThen somehow tell ubuntu to send any traffic coming through port 80 to /var/www\nMy router is a Linksys BEFSR41.\n\nA: Port 80 is the standard HTTP port, so you just have to install a web server (eg. apache2) on your Ubuntu machine. When it comes to the router, you just have to forward port 80 on the router to port 80 on your Ubuntu machine. How to do that depends on the router, but it should be configurable from the web interface.\n\nA: There's only one resource you'll ever need:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.portforward.com\n\nA: These are couple of things you need to do to accomplish this, that is after you make your web server working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Know your ISP IP address.

I use a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 on Ubuntu 10.10. The multimedia keys (Volume, Play/Pause) work, the Mail and Calculator button as well.\nNow I would love to use the zoom slider, if it were possible I'd like to use page scrolling with that. Is there some way to enable that?\n\nA: In order to configure the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard 4000 we have to create a configuration file that contains the keyboard declaration and the records for mapping the keys.\nTo do so there are three types of information we need to determine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard type \n\n*The key scancode which is the actual key on the keyboard\n\n*The key name to assign the desired functionality to the selected key\n\n\nFirst find the keyboard type:\nIn terminal run the following command:\nlsusb \n\nthe output determines the keyboard type:\n...\nBus 004 Device 022: ID 045e:00db Microsoft Corp. Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 V1.0\n...    \n\nIt appears after ID. In this case it is 045e:00db \nSecond find the scancode and the name of the key. \nTo determine them, we use the evtest program which logs out the event information of a specific device on terminal:\nevtest\n\nIf you don't have the program, install it by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install evtest\n\nBy running the evtest program we get the following output:\nNo device specified, trying to scan all of /dev/input/event* Available devices: \n/dev/input/event0:    Power Button     \n/dev/input/event1:    Power Button     \n/dev/input/event2:    PixArt USB Optical Mouse   \n/dev/input/event3:    Microsoft Natural® Ergonomic Keyboard 4000   \n/dev/input/event4:    Microsoft Natural® Ergonomic Keyboard 4000   \n/dev/input/event5:    HDA Intel Front Headphone     \n/dev/input/event6:    HDA Intel Line Out     \n/dev/input/event7:    HDA Intel Line   \n/dev/input/event8:    HDA Intel Rear Mic     \n/dev/input/event9:    HDA Intel Front Mic     \n/dev/input/event10:   HDA ATI HDMI HDMI/DP,pcm=3\nSelect the device event number [0-10]:\n\nThe output is pretty much self explanatory, insert the appropriate number for the keyboard, which here is number 3 then hit enter:\nDoing so, will output lots of information on the terminal and ends in following lines:\n... \n\nTesting ... (interrupt to exit)\nEvent: time 1472203902.240594, type 17 (EV_LED), code 0 (LED_NUML), value 0\nEvent: time 1472203902.240594, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------\nEvent: time 1472203902.281456, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 70058\nEvent: time 1472203902.281456, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 96 (KEY_KPENTER), value 0\nEvent: time 1472203902.281456, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------\n\nNow with every key-press on the keyboard it dumps out the key information. For example the Slash key next to the Right Shift shows:\nEvent: time 1472205062.294078, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 70038\nEvent: time 1472205062.294078, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 12 (KEY_SLASH), value 0\nEvent: time 1472205062.294078, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------\n\nThe first line of the log contains the information about the actual key on the keyboard such as scancode which comes after the value. In this case it is 70038\nThe second line contains the assigned functionality information like name of the key. In this case it is SLASH. Examine the other keys to find their appropriate names. \nSo in a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Our keyboard type is: 045e:00db \n\n*The scancode of the Slash key is: 70038 \n\n*The name of the key for assigning is SLASH\nAfter gathering the necessary information we create the configuration file:\nsudoedit /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-keyboard-local.hwdb\n\nHit i to activate the Insert mode and type the following:\nkeyboard:usb:v045Ep00DB*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_70038=minus      \n\nSave and exit by pressing escape then typing :wq and hit enter. \nThen run the following two commands for the configuration to take effect:\nsudo udevadm hwdb --update\nsudo udevadm control --reload\n\nFinally unplug the keyboard and re-plug it in.\nSome notes about the configuration file:\n\n\n*\n\n*The format of the file should be exactly as shown, the space before\nmapping records is critical. \n\n*Instead of sudoedit you can use any other text editor, just remember to follow the exact format of the file as explained above.\n\n*There are two characters added to the keyboard type: v and p which stand for vendor and product. They are important as well.\n\n*The keyboard type is written uppercase in the configuration file. Our keyboard type was 045e:00db but in the configuration we insert v045Ep00DB*  \n\n*The scancode of the key comes right after KEYBOARD_KEY_\n\n*The key name appears in lowercase in configuration file \n\n*You can customize pretty much every key on your keyboard following this tutorial.\n\n\nA: The problem is that evdev driver ignores keycodes > 255.\nThe solution, thanks to Marco Chiappero:\n1) you have to define all the remappings that you need (in the form of \n\"scancode keycode\" list) and place them in a file under \"/lib/udev/keymaps/\" \n(for example I created logitech-lx710-cordless there). You can find the \nscancodes using evtest (\"sudo evtest /dev/input/eventX\", where X is your \nkeyboard device. Be careful, sometimes these extra keys are exposed through \na different device or your mouse interface: eg. event3 --> kbd, event4 --> \nmouse & extra keys). Here some sample output:\n\nEvent: time 1294153475.909379, type 4 (Misc), code 4 (ScanCode), value c1028\n\"c1028\" is the scancode value you're going to place in your keymap file, then \npick up a number from input.h as described earlier and convert it to \nhexadecimal. Then write the remap pair in your file, maybe with a descriptive \ncomment, like this:\n\n0xC1028 0x9a # rotate button\n\nIterate for every key > 255.\n\n2) you have to tell udev to apply this remapping file everytime it encounters \nyour keyboard, so edit the \"/lib/udev/rules.d/95-keymap.rules\" file adding \nthe udev rule that matches your HW. Please don't ask me to define a rule for \nyou. \nNOTE: you can immediately apply your keymap file by yourself typing \n\"sudo /lib/udev/keymap /dev/input/eventX /lib/udev/keymaps/$YOUR_FILE\" and \nverify it with evtest once again.\n\nNow, you can use the Gnome shortcuts editor to see that the keys are now \nusable inside X and create new shortcuts. However it might happen that no \nkeysym is assigned to that keycode (so you'll see 0xXY instead of XF86Foo). \nYou can see current mappings through xmodmap -pke, save the output into a \nfile and edit it if you need (a full keysym code list is available in\n\"/usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB\").\nOnce you added the keysyms to those keys you remapped, you can save this file\nas ~/.Xmodmap (or as /etc/X11/Xmodmap if you wish to apply to every user).\n\nA: Create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/98-ms-ergo.rules with the following contents:\nACTION==\"remove\", GOTO=\"keyboard_end\"\nKERNEL!=\"event*\", GOTO=\"keyboard_end\"\nENV{ID_INPUT_KEY}==\"\", GOTO=\"keyboard_end\"\nSUBSYSTEMS!=\"usb\", GOTO=\"keyboard_end\"\n\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", IMPORT{builtin}=\"usb_id\"\n\nENV{ID_VENDOR}==\"Microsoft\", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==\"00db\", RUN+=\"keymap $name 0xc022d pageup 0xc022e pagedown\"\n\nGOTO=\"keyboard_end\"\n\nThis will map the zoom key to page-up/page-down without changing the installed files in /lib/udev.\nOnce added, you just need to unplug and replug your keyboard for it to start working.\n\nA: On Xubuntu 13.10 (perhaps on Ubuntu 13.10 too) the same can be done as follows:\nEdit key mappings in /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb:\n###########################################################\n# Microsoft\n###########################################################\n\n# Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000\nkeyboard:usb:v045Ep00DB*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022d=pageup\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022e=pagedown\n\nRun \nsudo udevadm hwdb --update\nReboot.\n\nA: On my machine, extra keys (HomePage, Search, Calc, etc.) and zoom input were sent though /dev/input/event5 whereas ordinary keys were sent through /dev/input/event4. Zoom key value agree with queueoverflow's.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu 10.10 beside Windows 7 onto a fake raid? I currently have 4 drives setup in Raid 10. I've tried installing Ubuntu straight to the metal but it does not recognize my Windows partition and upon quitting the installation and then restarting, my raid goes Offline. \nIve also tried creating a partition and using the Windows version of the installer (through windows). When it restarts and begins finalizing the installation, it snags and complains that it can not find the installation iso. Again, restarting shows that my raid members are offline.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It sounds like you've got a \"fake raid\" system.  That is, the operating system directly accesses the disks and the BIOS has enough smarts to boot off such RAID disk sets.\nThis is supported in Linux via the dmraid package, which should configure the the set as a /dev/mapper/something device (you don't want to install anything to the underlying /dev/sdX devices, since they refer to individual member disks in the RAID set).  The following page should give some details on how to install Ubuntu on such a system:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\nWhen booting from the install CD, it would be worth picking the \"Try Ubuntu\" option first and checking whether the RAID set has been detected correctly.\n\nA: Not sure if this will help or not, but you may want to check this out:  http://salamander-linux.com/install.php\n", "Q: Can I change the Unity Launcher transparency?

I'm running a website on 10.04 and am not sure how to set up my crontab. Should I create it under root or a user such as www-data? Python, Postgres, Nginx.\n\nA: JGBelacqua has a good point, the context of your cron-user depends on the task. Does it really require root permissions to run? If the specified task does not require any elevated privileges you are probably better off running it as the WWW service user www-data.\nThe big idea here, is if you need to access parts of the system that are unavailable to www-data, (and for good reason) then its safe to setup the crontab as your root user. Just make sure that if you're moving files about that you  associate the proper chown/ghgrp commands so www-data can access them (respectively if they need to be accessed by the www-service)\nTo illustrate with an example, I run nightly database backups of my pgSQL and MySQL databases with a fairly thorough PHP script. Its executed by my www-data user as it compresses, archives, and posts them to a management web-interface. Thus it needs to be accessible by www-data. If i didn't need this to happen; say I were to copy a nightly snapshot of my website to a directory i didn't want my normal users to have access to, I would run this as root.\n", "Q: How do you change the font color in the Unity panel? With my current (and favorite) theme the Unity panel is black text on a black background.

You'll likely find that in the file /usr/share/themes/<theme>/gtk-2.0/gtkrc.\nNote, that this doesn't affect the home button and indicator icon color. For that you'd have to change the icon set used by your theme (in Appearance Properties → Theme tab).\n\nA: Use GTK Theme Preferences...\nCode:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:shimmerproject/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install gtk-theme-config\n\nAlso add your current panel background color when you change panel text color.\nInstall gcolor2 for the old style color picker to copy your panel color or look in your theme.\n", "Q: How do I wipe all personal information from my computer?

One of the lingering issues I have to resolve is avoiding abrupt system crashes due to depleted battery power.\nIs there a low-profile, low-dependency daemon that will handle this situation?  I'd like to be able to configure it to, for example, drop the system down into hibernation at 4% battery life if the AC is not connected.\nI suppose I could just write a little cron job to poll /sys/.../batt*/.. and /sys/.../ac*/... every 10 minutes or so, but it seems like there might be some edge cases that need tending.\nupdate\nlaptop-mode-tools sounds promising:\n\nIt ... supports various ... power management features, such as ... automatically hibernating if battery levels are too low...\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem to be possible to install it in Maverick without relatively dire consequences.\nOn my system, its installation also requires the removal of the acpi-support package, which sounds sort of ominous.\n\nA: You are very probably already running it:  acpid.  If the GNOME or KDE stuff is already installed then you'll find a bunch of ACPI event handlers already in /etc/acpi/events and scripts run in response to those events in /etc/acpi itself; you can modify or replace those scripts with your own handlers.\nUnfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a lot of documentation included with Ubuntu about what events are available, and the handlers I see provided with acpid and acpi-support don't appear to include anything that tracks the battery level.  Since ACPI should be providing events for that, you may have to experiment with /usr/share/doc/acpid/examples/default* to see what events are actually delivered so you can write handlers for them.\n", "Q: Is Wubi safe on Windows Installation? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat are the benefits of a disk install vs. Wubi? And can I migrate my settings easily? \n\nIs Wubi installer dangerous? I want to know this before i install it on my laptop. I really want to use Ubuntu OS as my secondary operating system, primary being windows. Thanks.  \n\nA: Not at all.\nAs said in ubuntu wiki:\n\nThe Windows-based Ubuntu Installer (Wubi) allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu from within Microsoft Windows. It lets a Microsoft Windows user try Ubuntu without risking any data loss due to disk formatting or partitioning. \n\nSo try it and don't worry.\n\nA: I've found WUBI most useful in situations like these:\nThe laptop comes pre-installed with 4 primary partitions, like Manufacturer restore, Windows Preboot, Windows OS and Windows Data. There is no way to add extra partitions for a native Linux install without combining or deleting existing partitions.\nWUBI works great in these situations if there is a basic (not dynamic) uncrypted windows partition available. It creates a large file in the windows drive and uses it for storing the linux filesystem.\nAlso, I've experienced one occasion where Wubi ran just fine for weeks, then wouldn't start anymore after a linux kernel update. Windows would still run just fine. The solution was to boot the computer with an Ubuntu LiveCD and edit the Grub startup file, details are here:\nhttp://tdelphihobbyist.blogspot.com/2010/12/simple-fix-for-my-broken-wubi.html\nSo, my recommendation would be to primarily install Linux on it's own partition. If that is not possible, by all means use Wubi. It will give you a chance to run Linux without any virtualisation and experience it's versatility and speed first hand.\nBy default, Wubi uses this chain of booting: MBR -> windows bootloader (choose Ubuntu) -> grub bootloader -> Linux. The default boot OS will be windows, and it can be changed from windows' side My computer properties.\nOn a native Linux install, the boot goes by default: Grub on MBR -> Linux. You can choose windows from the grub menu, but it's not the default. To change windows to be grub's default boot option, use these commands in Linux terminal:\ncd /etc/grub.d\nsudo mv 30_os-prober 08_os-prober\n\nA: While Wubi is an officially supported method of installing Ubuntu within a Windows environment some users have had boot issues after kernel updates.\nIt is a useful solution if you want to try Ubuntu and uncertain on disk partitioning but ultimately a dual boot installation is a more useful long term solution with updating operating system versions, programs, kernels etc.\nAn alternative to a Wubi install would be the live CD environment where you can try and test all aspects of an Ubuntu installation BEFORE any installation to your hard drive - this is by far a more useful option if you just want to quickly 'test run' Ubuntu before committing to installing.\nInformation on Wubi can be found here on Wikipedia and the official website\n\nA: Ive had no problems using Wubi. Whats great is Windows sees Wubi/Ubuntu as just another program installed on your Windows computer. You are able to delete it any time if you dont need Ubuntu. Some things to consider... I believe a Wubi install can only give you a max of 30GB partition size. You'll find that out after installing Wubi and when setting up Ubuntu using Wubi.\nGood luck! Just do all Ubuntu and never look back!\n\nA: Wubi is a very safe way of trying out Ubuntu because you don't have to partition or mess with bootloaders. There have been some booting issues, primarily with 10.04 Lucid Lynx (and upgrades from 10.04 to 10.10) due to some issues with grub updates (grub is the bootloader Ubuntu uses). Fortunately these problems have been solved for the upcoming release Natty Narwhal 11.04, and the fixes will soon be applied to earlier releases as well.\nIf you want to read about the problems and their solutions, the Wubi Megathread on ubuntuforums.org is a good place.\nSomething else you want to note is that Wubi uses a virtual disk (a loopmounted file) so you want to try and avoid hard shutdowns as it can result in corruption. If it appears to be hanging you can usually restart with Alt+SysRq R-E-I-S-U-B. Corruption of the root.disk will not affect Windows, but if you end up using Wubi for a while you will need to ensure your data on Ubuntu is kept safe.\nYou can also review the Wubi Guide for more information. \n\nA: Yeah it's convenience to use wubi to install ubuntu OS. However it has some problems with hibernate. The OS may not recovery successfully and you may not get into the system again. \n", "Q: Building a new rig: will a 9800 GT work well for my needs? I'm in the process of pricing out and purchasing components for a new computer, and I wanted to make sure that my selections will run as expected in my planned install of Ubuntu 10.10 x64.  Right now I'm looking at this GPU and motherboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*EVGA 512-P3-N982-B2 GeForce 9800 GT Akimbo\n\n*Gigabyte GA-880GM-UD2H\nI'm including the motherboard just in case I've made some gross oversight and these two components aren't compatible, or my novice-level knowledge of Linux shines through and I've missed something entirely about how the Linux kernel interacts with bits of the motherboard.\nOne can never be too careful.\nMy gaming habits are limited to Minecraft and potentially WoW, and to be honest I'll probably have a Windows partition for running WoW anyway until I double the planned 4GB of RAM (I've already selected a quad-core CPU).  In any case I'm not the type of gamer who runs the latest games at 1920x1080 resolution with all the settings on max.  I'm more interested in smoothness than flashy graphics.\nMy question boils down to this: Will this GPU run properly and allow me to play something like Minecraft with a respectable level of performance?  Additionally, how will WoW perform?\nI would also be greatly appreciative of any random advice that you may have to offer on this matter, as I'd rather not leave any stone unturned before I make my purchases.\n\nA: You will be able to play Minecraft awesomely. In my personal experience with Minecraft (Server Admin). It's most important to have at least 4GB and a quad core processor. Other than that, everything should be exactly what you need.\n\nA: Since I haven't gotten a suitable response, but I have received my hardware and installed Ubuntu 10.10 x64 on it and been using it for a few days now I can safely answer this question:\nThe hardware I chose is fully capable of doing everything I wanted it to do.  Minecraft runs beautifully full-screened (1920x1080) with max settings, and while I haven't installed WoW via Wine or a VM I do know that in a pinch I can repartition my HDD and install Windows XP and it will run like a dream.\nEdit: I've now installed WoW using Wine and I can confirm that it runs beautifully.\nHope this helps someone in the future!\n", "Q: Connecting to Internet Through Another Computers Connection I have an old laptop running Ubuntu 10.10 (server edition) that I want to connect to the Internet, but it's Wireless card isn't working properly, so on the recommendation by a friend, I tried to connect to my Desktop (Windows XP) through Ethernet, and connect to the Internet through that, but the old guides I can find are for the Desktop edition of Ubuntu (e.g. GUI-based), and I don't know enough about the Terminal to figure it out on my own.\nAre there any good guides then, on how to configure Ubuntu to connect like this, strictly through Terminal commands?\n\nA: If your ubuntu machine has the internet connectivity:\n\n\n*\n\n*right click the network manager applet.\n\n*go to \"edit connections\". \n\n*In the wired tab select the the ethernet connection between the two\ncomps that should be there if you've\n\n*connected the computers with the\ncable.\n\n*click 'edit'.\n\n*under ipv4 settings, change dhe method to \"share with other\ncomputers\"\n\n\nA: I don't know how to solve this completely, but as a workaround you could set up a proxy server on the Windows machine. Then, configure your network-aware programs on the Ubuntu machine to use the proxy server.\n", "Q: How to restrict users on deleting files from trash folder? I want to restrict my users on deleting files from trash. Also i dont want my users to delete files bypassing trash. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: No, users will always be able to delete the files they own (modulo some complex ACL setups which are not feasible for a desktop).\n\nA: The trash can in ubuntu is just a special subdirectory under the user's home folder, which by definition is owned by that user.   Even if you change the file permissions, the user could change them back and then delete the file.\nIf you are trying to avoid data loss, a much better solution would be to set up automated backups - that way anything that did get deleted could be recovered.  \n\nA: Part One\nWe will change the attributes of the trashed files so only root can change it back and eventually delete then. \n1) Edit /etc/rc.local to looks like this:  \n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing \n# but desgua has changed it \n# to keep a copy of trashed files\nwhile [ \"$var1\" != \"end\" ]\ndo\nsudo chattr +i /home/user_name/.local/share/Trash/files/* \nsleep 2\ndone\nexit 0\n4) Make it executable.  \nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n5) Reboot or logout and log back in.  \nps-1: just to take it easy with the processor the attribute change is made every 2 seconds. You may change that as you like.\nps-2: to remove the attribute \"i\" (immutable) just execute:  \nsudo chattr -i /home/user_name/.local/share/Trash/files/*\nPart Two\nTo disable bypassing trash. \n1) Open gconf-editor.  \ngconf-editor\n2) Go to /apps/nautilus/preferences/enable_delete right click on it and \"Set Mandatory\". \nPart Three\nDisabling Shift + Del  \nWe will mod keymap.  \n1) Create a file\nnano ~/.Xmodmap\n2) Paste this and save:\nkeycode 119 = Delete BackSpace\nobs.: use \"xev\" to check if you keyboard Del really is \"keycode 119\"  \n3) We sure don't want this file to be deleted, so:  \n sudo chattr +i ~/.Xmodmap\n5) Reboot, logout or execute:  \nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\nNow done! \n\n\n*\n\n*last edit 04/07/2011\n\n\nA: I have not tested it thoroughly, but you should be able to do something like\nchmod -r $HOME/.local/share/Trash/files\n\nThen you can move files to trash, but you can't view them there. But, of course, anyone can change the permissions back. \nYou have to restart your session/computer in order to apply this change.\n\nA: desgua's answer covered all your requirements (and should be accepted answer, IMHO), but i think its important to highlight a few points:\n\n\n*\n\n*No matter what you do to the files at trashcan, you will be editing files and its permitions in a user-controllable folder ($HOME/.local/share/Trash). And since you cant remove permitions to user's $HOME, user could undo any changes.\n\n*Same goes for Gnome configurations, such as nautilus preferences and keyboard bindings. At best, you can change the default behaviour, but, again, any user could override this settings for its own session.\n\n*What about rm and similar CLI commands? rm is just an example, but there are tons of other commands that can be used by a user to delete (or destroy) its own files. Are you planning on removing the Terminal at all? What about Gnome's ALT+F2 (Run Application) ?\nMy point is: no matter what to do, its the users files, its the user session, and they will be able to bypass any protection you do if they want (and know how) to. desgua's answer is amazing, but be aware that its cosmetic only, useful only if you have non-techinical users. Its meant to be a convenience rather than a true security measure.\nTheres no true way to really achieve what you want unless you really change the whole distro in a very unusual way.\nThat said, why exatctly do you want this? For security or convenience? Isnt proper linux training to your users much better (and easier) than this?\n", "Q: HP LaserJet 1020 always asks for driver install On Ubuntu 10.10, HP LaserJet 1020 works plug and play style (plugged it in, printed test page without installing anything).

When I press Ctrl+Alt+F1 it goes to virtual terminal.\nWhat is this virtual terminal for? When do you need to use it?\n\nA: The main-frame computers to which old text terminals were connected to were not considered to be \"servers\".  They were just part of the computer system just like a monitor doesn't connect to a server PC.  Virtual terminals are not real text-terminals but are emulated text-terminals.  It's important to include the word \"text\" since they are not GUI terminals (sometimes called thin Clients).\nVirtual terminals are nice since one can set up each one to have a different color display by putting the setterm program in say the /etc/rc-local file that runs at boot time.  Then one may use one virtual terminal to run a script that does something that fails;  Use another terminal to change the configuration that might fix the problem;  Use still another terminal to look up documentation regarding the problem; use another terminal to go on the Internet with a text browser to help solve the problem, etc., etc.  Since each screen has a different color background, seeing the right color assures one that they are where they want to be when switching from one terminal to another.  But alas, there are not enough colors; only 8.  There is a terminal type linux-16color but how to use it?  setterm doesn't support it.\n\nA: A Virtual Terminal is a full-screen terminal which doesn't run inside an X window (unlike the terminal window on your graphical desktop). Virtual terminals are found on all GNU/Linux systems, even on systems which don't have a desktop environment or graphical system installed.\nVirtual terminals can be accessed on an Ubuntu system by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 till F6. To come back to the graphical session, press Alt+F7.\nYou can get more in-depth info about virtual terminals on its Wikipedia article.\n\nA: Not all users need or run a graphical environment, and they will work from the virtual terminals.\nMany (most) servers do not have a graphical environment as users are rarely logged in to the console.  Servers most often require a command line from which the administrator can access the system to monitor or configure it.  The virtual terminal provides this environment.  Having more than one virtual terminal allows the administrator to switch to another terminal if necessary. \nOn a desktop with a broken Xserver (graphical environment) the virtual console provides a terminal session from which the Xserver can be reconfigured.\n\nA: A Virtual Terminal is a full-screen terminal that doesn't run inside an X window (unlike the terminal window on your graphical desktop).\n", "Q: Installed libjava3d-java but cannot compile my Java3D project On my Mac, I can easily compile a Java project using Java3D.

If you turn it on, it won't add an entry to Banshee's sidebar, though.  Instead, you can use it to generate songs from within the Play Queue by choosing \"Fill by Similar Artists\" or \"Fill by Your Top Artists\" (options that are only available if you've turned on the Last.fm Shuffle Modes extension).\nIf you've installed an extension through Synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Center and it isn't showing up in Banshee's extension list, I'd file a bug against the Banshee package in Ubuntu.  If the extension is showing up in the list and the box next to it is checked, but it doesn't seem to be active in Banshee, I'd file a bug against the upstream Banshee project.\n\nA: This particular problem was simply a bug.

On the laptop, when I go to the \"Services\" tab I cannot select anything except Files.\nIs there anyway to solve it? \nOr there is any way to manually synchronize bookmarks? \nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: You can also use Ubuntu One to synchronise contacts, bookmarks and Tomboy notes.  If you don't have the required packages installed, the Ubuntu One control panel should prompt you to install them.\nAlso note that the bookmark synchronisation only really works reliably in Natty at the moment.  We are working on making this new synchronisation code available in prior releases.\n\nA: Found the answer to my problem ..\nThere are no menus in the applet window (as with previous versions I think) however when you start Tomboy an icon appears on the top bar (along with Network Time and User etc) which I had not noticed before.

I had thought it must be a issue related to my machine. Later, accidentally, when I copied and pasted a link from the sources file onto browser address bar I found that it was because the resolving of domain names of the repositories for my country was failing. I, painfully, edited the sources.list files on all my 3 machines from in.archive to us.archive. And it worked fine. So, my question is isn't it possible to specify multiple repositories existing is different locations?\n\nA: It is completely possible to specify multiple repositories, for example:\n\ndeb http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted\n\nIf the same versions of the same packages are found in both listed repositories, apt will download the files from the first listed repository.  If the first repository is out of date, and the second has newer files, then apt will pull from the second listed repository.  If either of the repositories are down, apt will pull from the repository that remains up.\nNote that you will still see complaints in your package managers if either repository is down, although this should not adversely affect your ability to download software unless all repositories are down.\n", "Q: notify-osd and dual monitors I use Ubuntu 10.10 on a laptop, with an external monitor, which is used as the primary.

I guess so.\nThanks.\n\nA: I believe it is too early to say whether Totem will be replace with Banshee in the future. While it is a good idea, Banshee does not yet have full support for Video Library management, so it is not really meant for being your dedicated video player.\nTotem is more mature, and while it does not have library support, the fact that it is a dedicated video player means it is more likely to hang around for quite a while until Banshee is more mature in that aspect, and able to replace it completely.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I believe in this possibility in the not too far, the Banshee to time is becoming a player full multimedia, although heavy consumption features of the PC. And now as the default Ubuntu tends to be more developed, these resources are still assumes no it. But in terms of video, vlc is very complete.\n\nA: Totem supports playing audio on the fly i.e. when you place your mouse pointer over a music file, it plays it straight away. If banshee can support that I think they might consider. \n", "Q: Is \"Ubuntu Tweak\" considered to be a \"safe\" program? Is \"Ubuntu Tweak\" considered to be a safe program for us on my 10.10 OS. Also I was concerned whether or not it was safe to delete all the programs that show up in the \"Package Cleanup\" option? \n\nA: Yes, it is a very nice and safe program. The package cleanup option only cleans the cache of downloaded program files, not the programs. I have been using Ubuntu Tweak and haven't been harmed by it yet.\n\nA: I would listen to Jorge Castro :) But since I dont and like to tinker around... Ive only ever had one problem with Ubuntu Tweak and that was early on when the program first came out. It deleted something in the OS that wasnt supposed to be deleted and I was having all sorts of errors.\nA year or two later now, its one of the first programs I install on my own system. I also do all the cleanup stuff and have not had a problem (minus that one time). For tinkering Ubuntu users, Id install it... for regular users or if you installed Ubuntu for a friend, they will never really need it.\n\nA: I really like Ubuntu Tweak. I think it is a good example of the line drawn between the \"Linux\" user and your average former-windows GUI based user. If you are a regular user, you might find it useful for the simplicity of it, but more than likely your going to make the tweaks yourself and not trust the program to do it for you. As many have stated on here. They would rather tweak themselves. \nIf you come from that GUI based background and as the average user does and most definitely want that ease of use and access, Ubuntu Tweak fits that purpose. One quick walk-through of the features to one of my friends that I recently converted from windows allows them to make some minor changes, one's that would require some command line, which my friend and most \"Joe Plumber\" users would shy away from. Minor changes like startup settings and default folder locations. \nAnother reason I say it's a good example of the \"in-between\" is if you are a say, slightly newbie or medium Linux user, with just enough knowledge to do damage. Tweaking the settings yourself and then playing with Ubuntu Tweak can cause issue's. So just stick to one or the other.  \n\nA: I don't trust this tool because it delves from tweaking and goes into package management outside of the trusted repositories and recommending PPAs so I never recommend it to people.\nHowever the author has recently began making it modular so people can just use it as a config tool without the other stuff -- once this gets finished and Ubuntu Tweak is in the Ubuntu Archive then I would consider it good to go!\n\nA: IDK how 'safe' I'd consider Ubuntu Tweak, because things it alters you'd be better off doing manually, either with, e.g., ccsm's settings window, or in an actual command line. If you know what you did, you can undo it. If you know which file you edited, you can revise it. If you press a button in Ubuntu Tweak, you may not know what it did or where.\nLikewise, ask yourself: is it faster to open UT, navigate to the package cleanup section, then press the button? Would it be faster if you just hotkey your terminal open and sudo apt-get autoremove?\n\nA: I'm using it (in KDE) and more than once when I've purged a PPA (thinking that only that PPA would be removed) it deleted each and every one! That wasn't what I expected. I have decided to use command line for cleanup, maybe Bleachbit occasionally (but mostly I use Bleachbit only for browser cache, cookies), and manage ppas by editing the /etc/apt/sources.list manually.\n\nA: I've been using Ubuntu Tweak through many releases of it and Ubuntu. It's the first thing I install with new releases of Ubuntu. My systems and those of my clients have never been harmed by it. It isn't necessary, as with all things Linux there are many ways to perform any task. It does however simplify the things it does do.\n\nA: is pretty safe, been using it for years and displays all the warnings to the user, etc. just make sure to read any if they appear.\n\nA: I've been using it for more than a year, through 3 or 4 diferent ubuntu version upgrades and never had a problem. If you make a mistake adding a ppa which program/s doesn't work (usually because those packages are alphas or betas) there's an option to purge that ppa and restore de debs from the official repos. \nIn the desktop side of the application, it has a \"backup/restore\" option so you can mess all you want with your configuration and restore if there's a problem.\nIt's the first thing i install in a new ubuntu install, I wish it was a debian version of it.\nSalut\n\nA: Ubuntu tweak is good for, well, tweaking but under no circumstances should you use the janitor tool! It just rendered my 12.04 unbootable after cleaning the files, packages, etc. it suggests. Fortunately I dual boot for this reason and things like this come with the territory when you tread brazenly in Ubuntu. I have yet to find a solution and I'll probably just reinstall 12.04 tomorrow.\nsource: just happened to me an hour ago.\n", "Q: \"Switch to specific workspace\" shortcuts don't work after a reboot i've defined some shortcuts to access each of my workspaces:\n<Super>+1 for the First\n<Super>+2 for the Second\netc...\n\nwhen I assign these shortcuts, they function properly until I reboot.

You can workaround this way:\nYou can use wmctrl and make shortcuts for specifics commands.\nBasics commands:\nIf you are using metacity:\nwmctrl -d to show all of your workspaces.\nwmctrl -s <workspace_name> to change to a specific workspace.\nIf you are using Compiz:\nyou will have to do a trick because Compiz \"workspaces\" are actually Viewports of a single Workspace.\nTrick Instructions\nCheck the output of wmctrl -d For example, mine is:\n\n0  * DG: 4098x2304  VP: 1366,0  WA: 0,23 1366x745  N/A\n\nThis means that actually I have one Workspace of 4098 x 2304 instead of what I \"think\" I have (nine \"workspaces\", 3 x 3).\nI was at what was supposed to be \"workspace\" 2, but actually I was at viewport (VP) 1366,0 (4098 / 3 = 1366) as showed by the output above.\nSo this is how it works: we take the whole Workspace and divide for the numbers of \"workspaces\" we \"think\" we have. In my case: 4098 / 3 = 1366 and 2304 / 3 = 768.\nif I want to go to my \"workspace\" 1, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 0,0\nThen, if I want to go to my \"workspace\" 4, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 0,768\nif I want to go to my \"workspace\" 8, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 1366,1536\nif I want to go to my \"workspace\" 9, the command is:\nwmctrl -o 2732,1536\nGot it? ;-)\nMaking the shortcuts\n1) We will need Compiz Settings Manager.\nYou can install these from the Ubuntu Software Center or by clicking here\n2) Open Compiz (Alt + F2 and type ccsm and hit Enter)\n3) Go to Commands and add for example wmctrl -o 0,0 to one command\n4) Then go to Keybindings and make the <Super>+1 shortcut for it.\n5) Repeat steps \"3\" and \"4\" for the others workspaces.\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue with a few compiz settings. Here is my fixcompiz.sh that I run on each boot, with an entry in \"Startup Applications\" (I run 12.10), that resets some settings that get kicked back to default when the computer reboots.\nAs a side note, we should really submit a bug on this.\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#fix min and maximize    \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings maximize \"['<Super>Up']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings unmaximize \"['<Super>Down']\"\n\n#fix switch to workspace shortcuts\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-1 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Home']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-2 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Up']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-3 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Page_Up']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-4 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Left']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-5 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Begin']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-6 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Right']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-7 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_End']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-8 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Down']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-9 \"['<Primary><Shift><Alt>KP_Page_Down']\"\n\n", "Q: How to download songs from Amazon's Cloud Player? Using the latest Banshee (1.9.6) and the Amazon MP3 extension, I just bought an album, and it was copied to my Amazon Cloud Drive/Player. How do I download this to my computer? Banshee's Amazon MP3 does not seem to open the Amazon Cloud Player pages, and the Amazon Cloud Player website keeps asking me to use their downloader program (which didn't work, perhaps too old).\nOn a side note, I can download the files individually from the Amazon Cloud Drive website, but that is not an ideal solution. I want to click a few buttons, download the whole album at once, and import it into Banshee (like it used to, before the Cloud Drive stuff).\n\nA: The .amz files downloaded from Amazon's Cloud Drive are actually (subtly) different than the .amz files downloaded from their .mp3 store.  Banshee's Amazon downloader wasn't able to recognize and open these files in Banshee 1.9.6, but this has been fixed.  The fix is in Banshee 2.0, which is in 11.04.\n\n\nA: There is no Amazon Cloud Player for Linux, or any client for it. The only way to download music which is already purchased, and is stored in the cloud player on Amazon, is to download the songs one file at a time.\nWhen purchasing, however, you can use the Download your music now link on the Thanks for your purchase page, which will use the classic method of downloading music via an .amz file, which can be used with banshee, clamz, or other downloaders that support .amz files.\n\nA: I found that Banshee 2.2.1 was downloading my amazon mp3s to /tmp/banshee-amz-downloader\ninstead of my media or downloads folder.\nUnfortunately there is no setting for where to download the files :/\nAnyway, if you bought music and you downloaded it and not you don't see it in your library and can't find the files - try looking in /tmp/banshee-amz-downloader\nFor me the files had non-sense names like ee4560889fdf09fg.mp3 but their icon was the album art.\nThe best way I've found to import them:\n1).  Use banshee to download them to /tmp/banshee-amz-downloads.  I just double-clicked the .amz files and it had an option to open with banshee so I did that.  It showed a loading bar and when it finished:\n2).  Change your Banshee settings from them default settings to copy imported music to media folders, and to update metadata and file and folder names: Edit->Preferences then check boxes: \"Copy files to media folders when importing\", and \"Write metadata to files\", and \"Update file and folder names\"\n3).  Import the /tmp/banshee-amz-downloader folder's contents using Media->Import Media or by copying the folder into the music folder that Banshee is set to look in and rescan with Tools->Rescan Music Library\nThe end result will be copied mp3s sorted into appropriate folders in your music library with appropriate file names and metadata, and available in Banshee\n\nA: There's clamz, which is a command-line tool that works with AMZ files.\n\nA: One graphical option is 'Pymazon'. But it's not in the Software Centre so you'd have to follow the instructions on its website to install it.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pymazon/\n\nA: I have written a small GreasMonkey Script you can use in Firefox (probably also Chrome) which will unlock the multiple song download feature on Amazon Cloud Player. You can find it here:\nhttp://userscripts.org/scripts/show/426973\nThe resulting file you can then open with clamz or pymazon.\n\nA: seems to be working now!

Then I did something screwy and now when I boot I get a grub rescue command line.\nSo I follow the instructions on that same page related to rescue mode, but am a bit confused.  If I do ls, I get:\n\n(hd0) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos5) (hd1,msdos1)\n\nIf I attempt to list the contents of these partitions, the only one that works is (hd1,msdos1), all of the others say \"unknown filesystem.\"  Examining the contents of this partition, it appears to contain my Ubuntu home directory.\nIn any case, I found some combination of commands that do something:\nset prefix=(hd1,msdos1)/boot/grub\nset root=(hd1,msdos1)\ninsmod /boot/grub/linux.mod\nlinux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdb1 ro\ninitrd /initrd.img\nboot\n\nIt then looks like it's going to work, but I find myself in some kind of prompt which calls itself busybox initramfs.  I try various things, but can't figure out how to run the command update-grub as recommended.\n\nA: This is a quick and simple method of restoring a broken system's GRUB 2 files. The terminal is used for entering commands and the user must know the device name/partition of the installed system (sda1, sdb5, etc). The problem partition is located and mounted from the LiveCD. The files are then copied from the LiveCD libraries to the proper locations and MBR. It requires the least steps and fewer command line entries than the following methods.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the LiveCD Desktop (Ubuntu 9.10 or later).\n\n*Open a terminal by selecting Applications, Accessories, Terminal from the menu bar.\n\n*Determine the partition with the Ubuntu installation. The fdisk option \"-l\" is a lowercase \"L\".\n\n\nsudo fdisk -l\nIf the user isn't sure of the partition, look for one of the appropriate size or formatting.\nRunning sudo blkid may provide more information to help locate the proper partition, especially if the partitions are labeled. The device/drive is designated by sdX, with X being the device designation. sda is the first device, sdb is the second, etc. For most users the MBR will be installed to sda, the first drive on their system. The partition is designated by the Y. The first partition is 1, the second is 2. Note the devices and partitions are counted differently. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the partition containing the Ubuntu installation.\n\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sda1 Note: If the user has a separate /boot partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/boot\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the grub-install command as described below. This will reinstall the GRUB 2 files on the mounted partition to the proper location and to the MBR of the designated device.\n\n\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sdX\nExample: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\n6.

I have 2 different versions of PostgreSQL installed on my system (Ubuntu Lucid):\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/lib/postgresql/8.4\n\n*/var/lib/postgresql/9.0\n\n\nBy default, when I run a PostgreSQL command such as createdb or psql, the 9.0 version is used.  \nHow do I configure my system to use the 8.4 version by default instead?\n\nA: If you want to get rid of a version so the other one becomes default...\n# see what you've got...\npg_lsclusters\n\n# drop v13\nsudo pg_dropcluster 13 main --stop\n\n\nA: As James/Bryce correctly point out, the two versions will run on different ports.\nHowever the command line utilities will also be run as one version or the other.  For example pg_dump --version might give you an unexpected result.\nYou can configure this in a file called ~/.postgresqlrc\nFirst you need to know the cluster names, to find this, run the following command:\n$ pg_lsclusters\n\nThis will output the clusters available eg on my system I'm running 9.6 and 13:\nVer Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory               Log file\n9.6 main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.6-main.log\n13  main    5433 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/13/main  /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log\n\nThen create the file ~/.postgresqlrc and put the following to control the default version used:\n# Version Clustername Database\n13 main postgres\n\nChange 13 to the version you want to run as default, in the case of this question that will be 8.4 or 9.0.\n\nA: The various PostgreSQL command line tools will talk to the server listening on the default port (5432) by default.\nYou can determine which port each server is listening on by looking for the port variable in the /etc/postgresql/$VERSION/main/postgresql.conf file for the relevant server.\nTo get the command line tools to talk to the other server by default, you have two options:\nFirst, you could switch the ports the two servers are listening on by editing the previously mentioned configuration files and then restarting both servers (you'll probably want to stop each one before starting either).\nAlternatively, you can set the PGPORT environment variable to the port number of the desired default server.  That should affect all applications using the PostgreSQL client library.\n\nTo list the contents of each database cluster use psql -l -p PORT_NUMBER.  To migrate data see section \"24.4. Migration Between Releases\" in the PostgreSQL documentation. \nDeleting old versions of PostgreSQL saves wear and tear on laptops & SSDs, through reduction of disk writes.\n", "Q: How to setup a ubuntu home network based on a powerful server and many outdated laptops as terminals? I am wondering if it is easy to do this. I know that using X to serve the other computers ain't that difficult.

I am dual-booting Lucid and Snow Leopard on a Macbook Pro 5,3. I have uninstalled rEFIt, and I am wondering if there is a way (without reinstalling rEFIt) to boot automatically to the GRUB menu without requiring me to hold Option and select the \"Windows\" partition at each boot. Since there is actually no Windows installation on my computer, I can't access the Boot Camp Assistant to tell OS X to boot to the Windows partition by default.\n\nA: In OS X there is the Startup Drive section in System Preferences. Ideally you should be able to select Ubuntu as the default drive there. I wasn't able to, I just set refit to only show up for one second in the config file (not difficult to do). I only see refit for a split second so it doesn't really bother me. \nAlso if you only want to use GRUB, I'm assuming you still want access to OS X. Without chainloading GRUB you can't boot directly into OS X from the grub menu. The option is there but it won't work properly, so that's another reason to see refit for a second at bootup. \n\nA: Hold down option while booting, but when the drives appear hold down the left control key before you click on the Windows drive.  That will change the appearance of the icon beneath the drive to a circular arrow, and if you click on that it should set that as the default selection for future boots without holding down option.  I'm not sure if that will help, but that is how it works on my Macbook Pro 5,2 dual booting OSX and Grub/Linux.\n", "Q: No sound on a realtek AC97 I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 and I've no sound.

I found out that two jumpers were missing on the mainboard since no AC97 front connector from the case was connected. With the jumpers missing the mainboard \"thinks\" the sound is routed to the headphone jack, so no sound is routed to the back panel jack.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_High_Definition_Audio\n\"In the AC'97 design, the audio output is sent to the jack. If the headphones are not plugged in, the jack directs the audio to the return pins that are connected to the speakers. When a headphone is plugged into the front panel jack, the audio signal goes to the headphones; the return pins are disconnected, so no audio signal goes to the speakers. Many motherboards with AC'97 audio need two jumpers to short the pins in case no front panel audio module is connected.\"\n...old thread but I believe this may help a few others dealing with older hardware.\n", "Q: Will there be a place for example a website or a PPA that holds all the lenses for Unity? With the new feature lenses in the Natty Unity launcher will there be a website, ppa or something be created to easily get hold of them so users can browse and install the ones there want?\nAt the moment there is the default applications, files and folders lenses, but optionally there is two others at this point, the AskUbuntu and Gwibber lenses each with a separate ppa.  \nIt would be easier if they where all in one place.  \n\nA: We at OMG! Ubuntu! are currently building a \"visual directory\" similar to this for both Lenses and Application indicators that will be available before 11.04 launch. \n\nA: The place will presumably be the Software Centre.\nLenses are just like any other software in Ubuntu. I would imagine that by Oneiric (11.10) then there will be lots of lenses in the standard repositories that are very easily installable.\n\nA: I don't think so..well atleast for now..Simply because you can compare Unity Lenses to that of themes. They customize your desktop experience but they are not essential. Also the fact is they are developed by different authors who would like to maintain their own PPA.\nProbably in the future, someone might put together all the lenses under one PPA giving the choice to the users to install which ever one they prefer but that is not going to be official. For example, currently a PPA is being maintained by webupd8 blog owner which has a collection of themes. This is not official but just created to help other users.\nHope this answers your question.\n", "Q: How to convert LaTeX equations to SVG?

Several of the comboboxes that I use regularly (the box to select syntax highlighting in the gedit statusbar, boxes for choosing smart playlist criteria in Banshee, etc) require me to click on them with the mouse, scroll down for awhile, then click on the item that I want.  Being able to type into these boxes and have the list jump to the first matching entry would be a nice time saver.\nSo I'm wondering, has this been implemented in Gtk+ 3?  If not, is there a bug report somewhere that I could subscribe to?  And is there a technical reason that this hasn't been implemented, or is it a design decision.  Since this behavior is common in all major web browsers, I'm sure I'm not the first person to think of this, but a few minutes of Googling didn't lead me to anything relevant.\n\nA: No, this hasn't changed in gtk+ 3.\nBack in 2001, a bug was reported that dropdown comboboxes couldn't be navigated using the keyboard (even the arrow keys and Enter).  All parts of this bug were fixed except the part about typing text while the combobox has focus and having the list select the correct item alphabetically.\nMore recently, a new bug was filed requesting that combobox lists respond to all keyboard input by selecting items alphabetically.  This issue is still open.\n\nA: Well, the syntax box in Gedit isn't a combobox, just a button with a popup menu. The Banshee boxes are regular comboboxes, not comboboxes with entries.\nSo to answer your question, GTK 3 does have combobox entries, just like GTK 2. But the developers of each application choose wether to use them or not, same goes for any other widget. If a developer thinks a combobox is more convenient than a comboboxentry, then that's what you get.\n", "Q: Why am I unable to \"Test Drive\" applications in the Software Center? I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 Beta. One of the new features that I've seen being advertised is the ability to \"Test Drive\" an application. \nI wanted to try this out so I installed qtnx like so: sudo apt-get install qtnx. However once I went back into the Software Center it did not give me the option to test drive an app. The only buttons that showed up were More Info and Install. Clicking More Info just display a longer description and another install button.\nHow can I enable the \"Test Drive\" feature? \n\nA: Test Drive is currently limited to only the 30 most popular applications in the Software Center (see the bottom of this post on OMG!Ubuntu!).  If you weren't looking at one of those programs in the Software Center, that would explain why there was no \"Test Drive\" button.\n", "Q: Why am I unable to install the Nvidia 96 driver? I have a old Nvidia card that needs the nvidia 96 driver to enable all the fancy compiz effects (the noveau free driver doesn't work). I tried installing it with Ubuntu Software Center but it said that it had dependency problems. \n\nA: As long this is an open bug, you can try the open-source driver Nouveau. To enable the experimental 3D support for this driver, you need to install the package libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental.\nAlthough it says experimental and is still unsupported by upstream developers, that driver works pretty well on a lot of Nvidia cards.\n", "Q: Are there any free/open source alternatives to Adobe After Effects? I've been a illustrator and graphic designer for a number of years and now I'm looking to go more into motion graphics and visual effects. Is there anything that is open source/free (not a demo, education version or trial) that is as complex and feature-rich as Adobe After Effects but for Linux? I've tried Cinlerra, kdenlive, openshot and Blender and whilst they are good at video editing (and 3d modelling in Blender's case) they fall short in effects and compositing features.\nI've also tried Ramen, but the project recently closed and the last update was quite buggy.\nAlso, CineFX/Jahshaka doesn't work and hasn't been updated in many many years, so don't mention it ;-)\n\nA: Having used after effects a fair bit in the past and had a good search around on the open source community the simple answer is unfortunately no.\nThere are plenty of non linear editors, which are like adobe premier, but nothing really like after effects. The closest I can think of would be kdenlive which I have heard has a few effects (although I've never used it), however I don't think any of them really stand up to after effects.\nTBH I unfortunately switch back to my windows partition for doing any serious video editing like that because After effects doesn't work well under wine either. \nI would absolutely love to be proved wrong and someone know a really good effects program, but I suspect for the moment I'm going to be dissapointed.\n\nA: For anyone coming here through Google searches, a lot has changed since this post was made.\nFirstly, Blender has gotten much better at compositing and effects. There have been some really excellent uses of this, a (slightly outdated) example of which being Tears of Steel.\nSecondly, the software Jahshaka has been mentioned a couple times in this thread. It was dismissed due to being out of date. Well, as of 2013, it has developers working on it again, although it seems that their progress is extraordinarily slow.\nThere are, of course, other changes, but I saw those two as being the most notable. Please correct me if I missed something significant concerning the programs that have already been mentioned in this thread.\n\nA: Here In Greece there are not many studios that use AE. They use an open source software called Jahshaka which is pretty powerfull but a little unstable yet. Its developers, as far as I know, are working to the next release of it 3.0 which will be much more stable with more AE features.\nCurrent features are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Animation with 3d models\n\n*Layer based compositing \n\n*Non linear video editing \n\n*Picture Corrector, including: \n\n\n*\n\n*Keying, \n\n*Color Correction, \n\n*Real time particles, \n\n*Masks\n\n\n\nOn the first look it's pretty complicated to understand but if you play with it a little you' ll find out a beast.\nIt is still on beta stage and sometimes is unstable.\n\nA: I might be late to the party, but I felt that one important answer was lacking.\nWhile After Effects has it's place in VFX, it is considered to be old fashioned by many specialists in the field due to the archaic UI. Most modern competitors to After Effects use a node based user interface, with nuke being the prominent contender.\nAnd while open source alternatives to After Effects are lacking, node based alternatives are not! There is an offering called NATRON, which is already feature-rich and mature enough to be called an entry level replacement for After-Effects-if-it-was-node-based.\n\nA: Try Blender.  It's a free, open source content creation suite that has an impressive number of features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two built-in rendering engines, Blender Internal (fast) and Cycles (realistic), along with other experimental engines such as Freestyle\n\n*A game engine\n\n*The Bullet physics engine, which can be integrated with the above\n\n*A text editor\n\n*An image editor\n\n*A non-linear editor that works with both audio and video\n\n*Tight integration with the open-source, highly popular Python programming language:\n\n*\n\n*Python syntax highlighting in the text editor\n\n*An interactive Python prompt\n\n*A Python-scriptable interface accelerated with OpenGL\n\n*Extension with Python plugins\n\n*Python integration in the game engine\n\n\n*Motion tracking\n\n*Collada import/export\n\n*Compositing\n\n*A node editor for Blender highly flexible Cycles rendering engine\n\n*CUDA/OpenCL-based GPU rendering for Nvidia cards\n\n*Fluid, cloth, smoke, and fire physics simulations\n\n\nAnd much, much more.  Not to mention a rapid release cycle (~2 months), a large amount of high-quality documentation (both free and paid; see Blender Cookie), a large, vibrant community, a Blender SE proposal on Area51 currently in the commit stage and four successful Creative-Commons-licensed movie projects.\nHow does this apply to you?  Using the aforementioned motion tracking feature allows you to utilize Blender's power to generate some pretty good special effects (not quite on par with After Effects - it is primarily a 3D modeling application, after all).  As Blender's motion tracking algorithms get improved and the visual effects get more realistic, using Blender as a replacement for After Effects should become an easier and easier switch to make.\n\nA: I have Blender installed and will one day get my head around it.\nI have never used After Effects. I found this open source node-based compositor called Synapse for Linux and Windows:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/vexx/\nIt is not very well known so spread the word!\n\nA: Video editor are in the high priority list of the Free Software Foundation.\nhttp://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/\n\ncomplex and feature-rich as Adobe After Effects.\n\nWhat exactly it means? If it is possible can you explain better, or give a link to a video/page showing that effects?\nMaybe a free software project created to be a free replacement of After Effects is not a bad idea.\nWith the question of the Blender. I like it, but I think that the video editor of this program, it is not at the level of AE.\n-- \nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/fcrypt\n\nA: I know some time has passed since the OP, but I just had the same question and came across Natron - its design is based on Nuke, and it looks pretty promising. I'm intending to dig deeper into it real soon myself.\n\nA: Free software video editing software\nMany users are seduced into using proprietary software for video editing because they are unable to achieve the effects they want using the current state of the art in free software video editing and production software.\nMore and more everyday computer users are becoming amateur videographers, and we need to make sure that their operating systems come complete with free software to meet their needs.\nWays to help.There are a number of quality, free software video editing programs, such as Kino, Cinelerra, AVIDemux, Kdenlive, LiVES, Lumiera, as well as PiTiVi, Blender, and the Open Movie Editor. Along the way, the easiest way to help is to use these editors and to encourage others to do the same. You can help these projects directly by submitting bug reports, adding features, improving usability, and creating tutorials, guides, and documentation.\n\nA: I can definitely recommend Blender! It might look like a 3d-program but it is in fact a very powerful compositor. You can do color correcting, masks, compositions and lots of things inside of this program. I would say its a lot steeper learning curve than after effects, since you have to understand node based compositing etc, but I have used Blender now for 2 months and I can already do \"After Effects\" stuff in it if I want.\n\nA: I am a VFX artist and working around 7 years in VFX industry. Its really fortunate for adobe to have a very good group of mentors to teach After effect in an easy way. For that they are gaining lots of customers. But the truth is in VFX Standard Industry After Effects has gone cliche 5 years ago. No firms involving in Hollywood are preferring After Effect anymore. As the disability of Layer based limitation like multi channel EXR (Which is common). If any one interested in professional VFX should try this following applications:\n 1. http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke-product-family/nuke/\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview\nAnd also some other like photoshop (Gimp alternative), Hiero from Foundry, Zbrush from Pixologic and yes Houdini.\nMost of them are supported in Linux Platform, cause everyone knows for development organized programmers are the basic asset. Also Linux is used for simulation, Network Rendering and   asset management and yes Software Dev. But Zbrush one of the core for modeling has not yet launched. And if questioning about photoshop. They will not. So its an application variant. But for most of the pro apps there is Linux system, you just need to purchase it.But be aware of the flexibility and integration of your pipeline before purchasing them. \nIn the end for pro I think you should try linux only if you can get all your apps available in linux compability\n\nA: You should try Debugmode WAX. It is basically a more compact and easier to use version of blender. Although there are still a few problems with it, just check out their help page for all your answers.\nWAX HOMEPAGE: http://www.debugmode.com/wax/ \n\nA: You can also try Fusion free software from blackmagicdesign.com. The hardware necessary to work with it has to be upgraded up to 8GB (minimum) of RAM, Core i7 CPU and a good video card.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to Adobe Fireworks? I often have to make designs for internet-use. I have had Fireworks for years and it suits my purpose. These are the details I like in it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Good tools for moderate image manipulation (cutting, cropping, color changes, overlaying one image with another, blurring, etc.)\n\n*Possibilities to draw other objects easily (squares, lines, circles, shapes)\n\n*Easy options to apply textures, shadows, gradients, and other effects.\n\n*Preview of JPG / GIF / PNG export, easy quality settings -> useful when exporting for the web.\n\n*Ease of dragging, resizing, and moving objects (images, shapes, text) around on a canvas\n\n*Ease of working with vectors and bitmaps at the same time\n\n\nSo I guess those are the main qualities I like a lot in Fireworks. Now that I use Ubuntu I've tried Gimp and Inkscape, and some others, but I can not find all of the aforementioned qualities. Maybe it's me, but Fireworks still rules when it comes to these things, IMHO. So I run it under Wine.

Wine is a compatibility layer for Windows executables, allowing a number of Windows applications to run on Linux / Ubuntu.\nAccording to the Wine AppDB entry for NFS Shift 1, the application does have fairly good support and (assuming the patch is installed) should play with little or no problems.\n\nA: I'm not sure if those two are supported by PlayOnLinux  as yet, but that should be your best bet. Installation is automated.\nEdit: as George said, Wine (what powers PlayOnLinux) should be able to run it. You will just need to know what you are doing if you encounter problems installing ;).\n\nA: Speed Dreams is a nice linux option for racing.

Typically, all executable files go in one of a small number of directories. For example, all the stuff that I write for my own purposes goes in ~/bin.\nIf you don't want your actual binaries and scripts to live in a bin directory, you can create a symlink in, e.g., ~/bin to the actual binary.\nHaving all subdirectories in $PATH isn't particularly desirable, since it just adds more directories to search, increases the risk of other executables getting in your PATH that shouldn't be there, and doesn't really give much of a benefit.\n\nA: This should do the job\nPATH=\"$PATH:$(find ~/bin -type d -printf \":%p\")\"\n\nPlease take into account that\n\n\n*\n\n*The whole directory tree will be traversed, which can take some time, so try to keep the hierarchy small.\n\n*This won't take into account directories created after the PATH is set.\n\n*If you invoke this multiple times, there will get a lot of duplicates in the PATH.

Not the login keyring thing that pops up, but some people are being nosy and using my computer and I'd like to set a password before Ubuntu desktop even loads so people can't access my computer. Is this possible?\n\nA: The only way to hide your private data from nosy eyes is using an encrypted system as booting with a live CD grants root access to your system and your $HOME directory to anybody.\n\nA: Turn off \"automatic login\" in your system preferences.  Unless you have specifically set it up to auto-login, ubuntu will require a password before anyone can use the computer.\n\nA: Adding a boot password (from your BIOS settings) can also help deal with nosy people. It isn't fully secure, as someone could still remove your hard drive and access the files on it, but it you don't want to mess with encryption, a boot password and a login password will keep most people out.\n", "Q: How can I show the Unity launcher with the mouse? I love that Unity launch panel hides itself when a window is over it, but when I move the mouse over to the left edge of the screen, the panel won't show itself so that I can launch other programs that are placed in it similar to the way Docky does.\n\nA: A change has been made this month to reveal the launcher on left edge now (after a one second timeout).\nYou can revert to the previous behavior of launcher reveal only in the top left corner launching the unity-preferences application.\n\nA: Maybe, if you just change the sensitivity, the dock could show up more easily.

Or is this a bug to report? I wanted to have a look at Natty as-is, while my \"stable\" Linux is using Maverick.\n\nA: I believe you need 3D capabilities to run Unity. If youre running it in VB, you could try the Unity 2D ISO. That might give you the Unity design to try out.\n\nA: According to this answer testing Unity in Virtual Box >= 4.0 needs Guest Additions installed.

How do I tweak the precise mathematical curve used for the mouse acceleration in Ubuntu?\n\nA: That depends on what mouse profile you're using.\nThis blog describes a new mouse acceleration method added to Debian Squeeze (should also be in Maverick since Squeeze used xorg-server 1.7.7 and Maverick used 1.9.0). You can read the developer documentation here.\nIf you look at the source, you can derive the curve based on which Profile you're using. In the patch for AccelerationProfile, you can see the function SetAccelerationProfile which selects your profile. If you look at each of those profiles, you can see how the function is defined.\nSo to tweak it, you modify whatever inputs your selected profile takes.

If that folder do not exist, you can create it with command mkdir ~/bin. After opening new terminal, it's in your PATH automatically (assuming Ubuntu and bash, without .bashrc customizations). \nFirst method adds it to all users in your system, second one only to you.\n\nA: So, assuming bash (You are running ubuntu right? ;) ), you can create a function for this...\nj () {\n  javac \"$1\" && java \"${1%.*}\"\n}\n\nand then if you have a file called PureJavaAwesomeness.java, you could do\nj PureJavaAwesomeness.java\n\nand that should compile and run the java file.\nEdit: And, you might want to put that function definition at the end of your ~/.bashrc file, so it is loaded every time you open your terminal.\nEdit2: For some more awesomeness, you can use this function\nj () {\n  cname=${1//\\//.}\n  cname=${cname%.*}\n  javac \"$1\" && java \"$cname\"\n}\n\nThis will work even when you do j com/ssk/apps/PackagedClass.java, assuming the package of the PackagedClass.java is com.ssk.apps.

However, it's not guaranteed that camera works in Ubuntu with Flash. There have been multiple problems with that earlier.\nAlso, check out Flash settings.

I've tried both and the resulting Gvim feels the same (to me). If there is no difference, why are both packages maintained?\n\nA: Both packages provide the same application, but compiled with different dependencies (e.g. vim-gnome depends on libgnome2). Vim-gtk is important only to people who use Kubuntu (or some lightweight desktop environment) and don't want to install GNOME libraries. If you use the standard Ubuntu desktop, the dependencies are already present, and you can safely use vim-gnome.

I was wondering how to restrict the search range of \"locate\" to some directory?\nFor example, how to find files/directories with string \"math\" in their names under some directory \"/home/tim/science/\"?\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: You can use locate /rootpath/*filenamespec.I hadn't tried it before, but it appears to work. To do your example, it would be locate /home/tim/science/*math*\nYou may want to look at the find command rather than locate for that sort of behaviour. The syntax would be find rootforsearch -name filenamepattern -print. In this case, your example would require find /home/tim/science -name *math* -print.Not as fast as locate as there's no database to search ... it actually searches the filesystem. There are lots of options you can use other than print as well, if you intend to actually do something with the file.\n\nA: For me the most convenient is \ncd /home/tim/science\nlocate math | grep `pwd`\n\n\nA: UPDATE: A note about using locate's regex option vs the shell's filename expansion in relation to locate's args ...  \nSHELL FILENAME EXPANSION\nWhen you type locate /bin/b* (note there are no quotes), several things happen.  \n\n\n*\n\n*First, shell filename-expansion will expand the special shell pattern charecter * (This is because the * is unprotected, ie. there are no \"double-quotes\")    \n\n*This resulting expansion is a list of filenames. which is perhaps very long... This list is passed to locate as many individual commandline args.  \n\n*locate then tests each of these args against each of the files in its database, and outputs matches.  \n\n\nTake note however, that 'locate' has no concept of the current working directory. It only matches your args against the fully-qualified file-names in its database.\nThis means that it will match both /bin/bash and /home/user/bin/brackets\nYou have some degree of control this way, but locate's regex search offers more; as do some other of locate's options.  \nLOCATE'S REGEX OPTION\nWhen you type locate -r \"/bin/b.*\" different things happen than do with simple args.. (shell-expanded-args  are just a list of simple args)  \n\n\n*\n\n*The -r option tells locate to treat your arg as a regex pattern.  \n\n*The quotation marks protect the * from shell filename-expansion. It means that the * and the dot . are now special regex characters  \n\n*Being regex, you can very easily tell 'locate' to match its database entry in various ways: eg1. locate -r \"^/bin/b.*\" produces file names beginning with /bin/b ... eg2. locate -r ~/\"bin/b.*\" produces file names beginning with /home/user/bin/b .. Note that the ~/ is not protected by \"quotation-marks\" and is therefore subject to shell tilde-expansion which converts ~/ into /home/user/  \n\n\nSummary: \"shell filname expansion\" is quite different to 'regex' \nNow back to the original post:\n\nlocate typically lists the entire database to stdout, so to limit it to a particular directory you need to filter it... You can do this via locate's options.  \nYou can use locate's regex capability, rather than just shell-globbing  ...(locate /dir/myfile*  is shell-globbing)...\nFrom info locate: -r,--regex \n\n\n*\n\n*\"... (regex) matches are performed against the whole path name, and so by default a pathname will be matched if any part of it matches the specified regular expression.  The regular expression may use ^ or $ to anchor a match at the beginning or end of a pathname.\"\n\n\nnote: -i = ignore case\n. . . . . -r = regex\n. . . . . ~/ will be expanded  by the shell to /home/user (when ~/ is not in quotes)\n. . . . . '\\ ' (baskslash+space; no quotes) is a literal space (to avoid shell expansion). You can put the string in quotes, but be sure to leave the ~/ outside the quotes: ~/my\\ regex or -/\"my regex\" \neg. locate -ir ~/\".*\"la\\ bella\\ vita is the same as locate -ir ~/\".*la bella vita\" and will search your entire home directory for \"La Bella Vita\" occurring anywhere.  \nYou can also limit the search to just the file name but using the -b or --basename .. in which case the regex start-of-line ^ applies to only the basename...\nI most commonly find myself using locate -bir \nPS.. Locate is so fast, that I have never used find ... nor have I used nautilus search (too slow)  \nWith 'locate', if you are looking for something which is newly added, just run sudo updatedb to refresh locate's database...

Install Dropbox on both Ubuntu and Windows 7, and then set your Zimbra local folder to a folder within your Dropbox folder. That way, regardless of which OS you're using, Dropbox will sync the local files and you'll have all your emails available.\nThe other way I can think of is creating an NTFS partition and then setting your Zimbra local folders to that location - that way, both Windows 7 and Ubuntu will be able to access it. Definitely more convoluted than the above though.\n\nA: I don't know Zimbra, but a common problem of sharing folders between linux and windows is, that Windows lacks buildin support for common filesystems (ext, reiserfs, ...), and Linux-programs rely on user/group/others-read/write/execute-flags for files, which the windows-filesystems lack. \nMaybe a script for copying the filesystem and adjusting permissions could help.\n", "Q: Is there a way to share resources of a machine by running a program on one machine, but display it on another? Is there a way to sort of \"share\" processing power between two machines? I already use x2x and ssh to communicate between the two, but the two but that works with two moniters aswell. Is there a way I could have them both connected, but if I click an app on one machine (lets say cpu1) it would open on the machine with the most available RAM, and if it opens on cpu2 the window itself would still be on cpu1?\nBig ask, I know. If I haven't been clear enough then just ask.\nMore importantly, will anyone help me code this?\n\nA: It's possible to run a X11 aplication on a remote machine and display the result on the local one. This is as simple as\nssh -Y user@remote gedit\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu available for smart phones? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is ‘Ubuntu for phones’ and how can I get it? \n\nRecently, we have heard a lot about different powerful tablets and smartphones with operating systems such as Android or iOS. Now fortunately we see Ubuntu 11.04 will be available for tablets too. My question is that whether this version of Ubuntu will be available for smart phones with phoning features too? I mean can we have it on smart phones such as Samsung Galaxy Tab1?\nThanks in advance. . . \n\nA: A Kubuntu Mobile technology preview was part of the 10.10 release. I don't believe it is being shipped on any real hardware yet, but you can download it to try out in a virtual machine. Builds for Natty are also available.\n\n\nA: The answer is no, Ubuntu was not designed for phones. There are some hacks to make it work on phones, but not in a usable way.\nPS. Looks like there was a project called Ubuntu Mobile, but it's already dead.\nEdit: Ubuntu for phones has been announced, but it still isn't shipping yet.\n", "Q: Moving from Ubuntu to Windows 7, need hard to be NTFS format Ok so I want to change operating systems, I got a new PC recently that had no operating system so I installed Ubuntu on it. I now want to install Windows 7 but when I put in the install disk it says it needs my hard drive to be in the NTFS format. How can I change my hard rive to this format in Ubuntu?\n\nA: It is easier to install Windows first, and then install Ubuntu. (Windows tends to like to dominate the whole drive).\nWhat you need to do is put Windows on the disk's Primary Partition. This partition will be formatted with NTFS. you can do this by booting from the Windows CD/DVD and selecting to reformat the hard drive. Select to delete any partitions in the primary partition and then format with NTFS. Once done, install Windows OS. Then when you are done, use the Ubuntu CD to install ubuntu as a dual-boot.\nIf you install Ubuntu before Windows, when you get done, you will need to reinstall GRUB. If possible, the easiest solution, is to install Windows and then install ubuntu.\nIt's best if you do some reading before getting started so you have more knowledge of what you need to do:\nsee here:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition\nand here: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/switching/dualboot.html\n\nA: It depends upon how the partition table was when you made clean install of Ubuntu. Considering default options that are available during installation of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu is likely to be installed in a single partition, which is the size of your entire hard-drive, so what I mean is that you have single partition and entire Ubuntu installation has occupied your hard-drive. So, when you boot from Windows 7 DVD, it will show you only one partition, and that will be of unknown type, because Windows doesn't support EXT4 (default file system for Ubuntu and Linux in general). And in order to install Windows 7. You have two options.\n1) dual-boot Windows 7 with Ubuntu (which requires 2 separate partitions for both).\n2) Wipe out Ubuntu and keep Windows only (where you can format that \"unknown\" partition during Windows installation).\nI'd recommend you to go with the first option, and for this, you'll need to repartition your hard-drive to make room for Windows. You can repartition your drive using Gparted, instructions to resize partition are here, and then can install Windows normally.\nObviously, once you install Windows after installing Ubuntu, you'll need to re-install GRUB, since during Windows installation, the Windows Boot Loader will overwrite GRUB, you can find instructions to reinstall GRUB here.\n", "Q: Tool for creating pie charts I need a tool for creating high quality customizable pie charts, then export them to some graphic format (e.g. png).\nI need something which allows me to put in some data and which is more customizable than OpenOffice.org.\n\nA: Google Chart Tools?\nNot exactly what you asked for, but this may work anyways. Link is to a pie chart wizard.\n\nA: graphviz, optionally with one of its GUI wrappers should be able to do anything you need.\n\nA: The R language can be used to create bar and pie chart graphs. An example extracted from their help page:\n> d <- read.table(\"data/EU-2004.csv\", header=TRUE)     # read data\n> pie(d$seats,                                         # create pie chart with seats column\n+ labels=d$abbrev,                                     # use abbrev column for slice labels\n+ main=\"2004 EU Parliament Results\\n(Seats by Party)\") # create pie chart\n\nLater, they have an example where this sort of output is sent to a jpeg. I didn't see PNG output. It may be available, but worst case, a jpeg can easily be converted to a PNG.\n\nA: There is one great tool, which is, unfortunately, not so good at creating pie charts, but I cant help mentioning it\nIt is called gnuplot\nResources are:\nhttp://www.gnuplot.info/\nhttp://www.gnuplotting.org/\nhttp://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/\nhttp://gnuplot-surprising.blogspot.ru/\n", "Q: Can't install apt-file and ubuntu tweak in terminal I tried to install the packages apt-file, ubuntu-tweak and checkinstall using sudo apt-get install <package name> in 10.10, but the terminal reported package not found even after sudo apt-get update. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The problem is most likely that you don't have the universe or multiverse repositories enabled - not all software is in the core ubuntu distribution.  Luckily, it's simple to enable those from the system menu:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu \nAdditionally, even though those are command line programs, you can install them from the ubuntu software center or another graphical package manager.  \n\nA: If I'm not mistaken ubuntu-tweak is in it's own repository -- at least it always was. You can download the deb at http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ and then using ubuntu-tweak add it's PPA to insure it stays updated.\n", "Q: Upgrade crash samba4 error upgrade to Natty failed to finish, with an error related to samba4, failed to load modules from /usr/lib/samba/ldb.\nNow I am unable to update or run Synaptic. How can I fix this?\n\nA: The easiest way to fix this is probably to run \"dpkg --purge samba4\" in a terminal to uninstall Samba 4. We are also working on an update which fixes this particular error.\nSamba 4 is an experimental version of Samba. If you just need file sharing, I would recommend using the \"samba\" package (Samba 3) instead.\n", "Q: How do I delete album tags in multiple files? I have multiple tracks where I would like to delete the album entry. If I mark them in Rhythmbox and try to edit their tags, I can only change it to something else. If I leave the field empty, it does not change anything at all.\nHow can I void these fields?\n\nA: I would recommend a tool made specially for tagging such as Easytag, most media players are limited in this regard. What you want can be done easily with Easytag, Install using Synaptic or software center.\nor just type in your terminal\nsudo apt-get install easytag\n\nCompact guide:\n\n\nA: Music Brainz Picard is a great tag editor that can be of use.\nsudo apt-get install picard\nIt can even use APE tags (those tags drove me nuts with rhythmbox for the longest).\n\nA: You can do that with kid3-qt.\nsudo apt-get install kid3-qt \n\nIf you use kde, install kid3 instead (without \"-qt\").\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ease of use  \n\n*Edit ID3v1.1 tags  \n\n*Edit all ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 frames  \n\n*Convert between ID3v1.1, ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 tags  \n\n*Edit tags in MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, MP4/AAC, MP2, Speex, TrueAudio, WavPack, WMA, WAV and AIFF files  \n\n*Edit tags of multiple files, e.g. the artist, album, year and genre of all files of an album typically have the same values and can be set together.  \n\n*Generate tags from filenames  \n\n*Generate filenames from tags  \n\n*Rename and create directories from tags  \n\n*Generate playlist files  \n\n*Automatically convert upper and lower case and replace strings  \n\n*Import from gnudb.org, TrackType.org, MusicBrainz, Discogs, Amazon and other sources of album data  \n\n*Export tags as CSV, HTML, playlists, Kover XML and in other formats  \n\n\nSite: kid3.sourceforge.net \nHandbook Manual \n\n\nA: id3v2 is the cli tool I use.

But what if I want to select one of the Firefox windows to be normal size?  I know I can click on it to do that, but how do I do it with the keyboard.\n\nA: As far as I know that isn't possible in 10.10's Unity.

I do not know if it is relevant, but I have created an Ubuntu One account (although I don't know how to inform the OS about it).\n\nA: Paid applications in the Software Centre were introduced in Ubuntu 10.10, so you cannot get them from 10.04.\n\nA: Go to System Administration > Update Manager then click the Settings button. In the dialog box that opens, switch to the Updates tab, check the box next to the 'backports' repository. When you click Close, Update Manager will prompt to reload your software repository list.\nYou only really want to install a newer version of Software Center, so if you find that one in the list of updates (read descriptions), then install it and see if it has support for paid applications.

Last update brought shadows to the Unity panel - or at least I just noticed them.\nI know that I can remove any shadows I want through the Window Decoration plugin in ccsm but grabbing the panel doesn't give me its name.\nSo, what do I have to add to the Shadow Windows rule to remove the Unity panel shadows?\n\nA: For 11.04 and 11.10:\nReplace /usr/share/unity/3/panel-shadow.png with an invisible image.\n\nA: For 14.04 and above:\nReplace image /usr/share/unity/icons/panel-shadow.png with transparent png image. \nBetter way to find shadow in future revisions is locate panel-shadow.png in terminal.\n\nA: For 12.04:\nThe relevant file is now at:\n/usr/share/unity/5/panel-shadow.png\n\nYou can delete it, you can rename it, or you can back up the original image and used Gimp's eraser to make the image transparent (just erase the whole thing).\nIf Unity can't find it, it won' t complain (or show it to you).\nKeep in mind that whenever Unity is updated, it will replace the shadow image file, and you'll have to repeat your fix accordingly.

So I've got the AskUbuntu chatroom (I'm just using this as an example, I've got other webapps that I've got the same issue with) saved as a \"Application Shortcut\" in Chromium, and the icon is really (And I mean really) low resolution. Example:\n\nThe top one is the default icon that's used for the Application Shortcut, the bottom is the AskUbuntu lens - so my question is, how can I use the icon that's used for the AskUbuntu lens. \n\n\nA: With daily chromium builds and recent BAMF you can (if you look closer to that screenshot, you can see an example with my site and high-res icon). But in the current state of chromium you need to do some hacking to make it support this easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make chromium generate a .desktop file for the application Menu too (if you don't want you to create one by scratch).\n\n*Get your chromium app window WM_CLASS with xprop | grep WM_CLASS | awk '{print $4}' (if it's just \"Chromium Browser\" or something similar you need to update chromium).\n\n*Edit that .desktop file (located into ~/.local/share/applications) with gedit or any other text editor; the file should contain:\nStartupWMClass=$APP_WM_CLASS_Found_on_step_2\nIcon=~/your/icon/file/name/or/path\n\ni.e. (for an app pointing to http://mail.google.com with google_mail.png in ~/.local/share/icons):\nStartupWMClass=mail.google.com\nIcon=google_mail.png\n\n\n*Restart bamfdaemon or unity at all; now when you'll run an application with that WM_CLASS the settings defined in the desktop file you've just edited will be used; icon included ;)\n\nA: Here is the easiest and fastest way. \nInstall Menu Editor: \nsudo apt install menulibre\n\nOpen Menu Editor, Select App, Click on icon to select a new icon:\n\n\nA: The easiest way for me was to install Alacarte (free from the Software Center) and edit the icon from there.

Like..\nUser john123, you can only use 100mb of my harddisk.\nUser jake155, you can only use 250mb of my harddisk.\n\nA: The standard way to do it in UNIX is through the quota command. It allows you to dynamically change how much disk space each user can use.\nSee the man page, or google for a tutorial.\n\nA: To restrict hard disk usage per user efficiently we could create a separate partition for each of the /home directories. However then it's obviously not so easy to change the granted space or add new users.\nWe therefore may use fixed sized images as a container for the users /home and mount these as loop devices (as root):\n1 mkdir /media/users/\n2 dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/users/john123.img bs=512K count=200\n3 mkfs.ext4 /media/users/john123.img\n4 mkdir /home/john123\n\nFor testing:\n5 mount -o loop /media/users/john123.img /home/john123\n\nAfter having done so we then create our user john123 who will now have 100 MB space available in his /home/john123.\nSubsequently the loop devices will have to be mounted prior to login, e.g. by adding this to /etc/fstab:\n6 /media/users/john123.img    /home/john123    ext4    loop    0    2\n\n\nA: The route to take may be to limit the size of a user's home directory, i.e. limit /home/jake155 to a certain size.  Typically a non-admin user cannot access anything beyond their home directory unless you change permissions otherwise.  This thread discusses multiple ways to do that.  \n", "Q: Can I get the Firefox 4 button icons from Windows XP to display in Ubuntu?

Coming from a Windows background, I'm used to being able to access global start menu shortcuts and user specific shortcuts in File Explorer, but the Gnome menu has me puzzled.\nWhen I navigate the menu by clicking the Ubuntu button at the top left (the equivalent of the start button on Windows), I can see all the application shortcuts are categorized according to what type of application they are.  But when I look at the shortcuts from where they're actually being read from (/usr/share/applications), they all appear in one big folder with no indication of how Ubuntu/Gnome is categorizing them into their own unique categories.\nHow does this work?  I'd like to be able to easily modify where shortcuts are located/appearing in the menu, as well as have the ability to easily add new shortcuts and manually categorize where they should go.  Is this possible?\n\nA: The files in /usr/share/applications are *.desktop files. They are simply text files that hold the shortcut data.

I'd like to use my camera's microfone to chat within skype.\nIn my systemwide sound options, I have two entries in the Equipment tab: One Duplex for the Internal SoundCard and one input for the camera. Though, I am unable to get the camera's entry listed on the \"Input\" tab. Does anyone know how should I proceed in order to use my camera's microphone?\nThanks,\nPedro\n\nA: First check the input tab, if your webcam mic is there, select the radio button beside it.\nIf it isn't listed. Go into the hardware tab. Select the webcam input and change the Profile below. Then go into the input tab and select the radio button.\nIf it is selected in the input tab, it should work in Skype.\n\nA: My problem was that the webcam wasn't listed in the input tab. I was able to fix this by pluging the camera in and rebooting with it connected to the computer.\n\nA: It is not needed to install alsamixer. The problem is, that Skype doesn't know where to listen and there is no option how to say in Skype environment directly. Install PulseAudio Volume Control from Ubuntu Software Center or via Synaptic.\nStart Skype and choose Options from blue S down. Select Sound Services. Check if both three options (Microphone, Speakers, Ringing) has setted PulseAudio Server (local).\nUncheck Allow Skype to automatically... to prevent too silent sound.\nClick button Open PulseAudio Volume Control, it should be visible down (if not, open it clasically from menu).\n\nIn opened PulseAudio Volume Control application click tab Input devices and check, if microphone is functioning (it is visible on the horizontal scale).\nThan click tab Recording. The page should be empty (no another device is recording).\nIn Skype call Echo/Sound test service, or call somebody, who is able to endure on line. This is only that way, how to set up microphone! During the session in Volume Control is visible what is recording. Push button in upper right corner and choose your web camera microphone input from list.\n\nIn next session Skype should remember those settings, so it is not needed to do this setting always. I suppose, that it is stored in ~/.Skype directory for further session.\nTested on Ubuntu x86-64 13.10, 14.04, 15.04, 15.10, 16.04 Skype 4.2.0.11, 4.3.0.37.\n\nA: The problem is with Skype - for some reason the microphone stops working. Even though the mic was working alright with other software, it wasn't with Skype.  I just entered: \nsudo apt-get install skype\n\nand things got back to normal.\n\nA: I solve that issue on my natty *installing alsamixer packages and deleted full Pulseaudio package. Of course, the Banshee connection on the top bar will disappear, but for me was the only way to solve it. Now, i use alsamixer controllers on the left unity bar to control volume.\nDon't forget to change de soundboard on skype options (choose this option if this is your case: \"HDA ATI SB ALC888 Analog Default Audio Device\")\nand in the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) type:\nalsamixer\nthen you'll have the power to control all of the sound of your machine and perhaps you should take care about disable \"mic boost\" and enable \"Capture\".\nI hope i helped you.\nJorge\n", "Q: Application with Output similar to the GUI output of \"WireShark\" I know that WireShark allows live packet capturing as well as details being displayable in the GUI.  Is there any similar program that operates on a CLI, rather than a GUI?  This is intended for use on a server install, in which only CLI is available (and also where disk space is limited, so much that the dependencies for the wireshark packages cannot be installed (i.e. the packages for the GUI).\n\nA: Sure, tshark  (text shark) is the same program, but with a noninteractive command line interface.\nYou can also run tshark on the server and transfer the captures over ssh to a wireshark gui running somewhere else.\nFor example:\n  mbp@joy% sudo tshark -i wlan0 -p  -R 'http'\n  Capturing on wlan0\n  3.929359 192.168.178.22 -> 66.102.11.104 HTTP GET / HTTP/1.1 \n  4.104763 66.102.11.104 -> 192.168.178.22 HTTP HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently  (text/html)\n  4.118925 192.168.178.22 -> 66.102.11.104 HTTP GET / HTTP/1.1 \n  4.295749 66.102.11.104 -> 192.168.178.22 HTTP HTTP/1.1 302 Found  (text/html)\n  4.355713 192.168.178.22 -> 66.102.11.104 HTTP GET / HTTP/1.1 \n  4.560568 66.102.11.104 -> 192.168.178.22 HTTP HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (text/html)\n  4.588767 192.168.178.22 -> 66.102.11.104 HTTP GET /images/nav_logo40.png HTTP/1.1 \n\nYou can also do tshark ... |tee packetlog so it goes both to the screen and to the file.  \nOr, alternatively, tshark -w stuff.pcap will write the raw packets into that file, which you can then copy to another machine and open within the wireshark gui, if you want to do more in-depth investigation.\n\nA: tshark \nis a good option.\nAn alternative is tcpdump ,\nwhich is a well-known predecessor.  It's widely available on other platforms, so you might run into it even if you don't use it on your server. \n", "Q: Creating TUN device for IPSEC Is it possible to create a separate device (like tun made by openvpn) for ipsec? If yes how can I do it?\n\nA: Yes, you can.\nExactly how to do this will depend on your situation.    \nHere's a bare-bones way to do it:\nLoad the kernel module. \n/sbin/modprobe tun\n\nCreate the tunnel device\ncd /dev\nsudo MAKEDEV tun\n\nThis will create /dev/net/tun .\nUse openvpn to create tun0 . \nsudo openvpn --mktun --dev tun0\n\nOptionally, edit /etc/network/interfaces, and bring up tun0 .\nsudo ifup tun0\n\n\nA: I think the OP is asking about IPsec VPN, not openVPN. As far as I can tell, IPsec binds a virtual IP to the outbound NIC(eth0, wlan0) as a secondary IP. \n", "Q: How can I make Rhythmbox start playing a radio stream as I log on? I want to have Rhythmbox start playing a radio stream as soon as I log in. I've tried to run various programs in /usr, including bashnee.desktop, but to no avail.\n\nA: You can add startup programs by picking System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications.  From there, you can add a new entry for Rhythmbox.\nFor the command line of the new startup application, use rhythmbox URI where URI refers to the radio stream you want to play.  If you don't know the URI for the radio stream, right click on its entry in Rhythmbox and pick properties.  It should be shown on the details tab.\n\nA: I use Rhythmbox/Banshee to manage my music collection, but for radio streams I prefer Radio Tray, which is extremely simple and useful. Since the version 0.6.2 it can remember the last played station and resume it on startup (using the --resume argument).\n", "Q: How can I install Pandoc version 1.8.1.1? I am having trouble getting a installing version 1.8.1.1 of pandoc. The repository has version 1.5.1.1, and the 1.8.1.1 tar.gz does not come with clear instructions for installation.\nI have also tried the recommendation from the pandoc page:\nsudo apt-get install cabal\ncabal update \ncabal install pandoc\n\nAnd pandoc is installed in ~/.cabal/lib/pandoc-1.8.1.1/ although man pandoc returns \nman: can't resolve /usr/share/man/man1/pandoc.1.gz: No such file or directory\nNo manual entry for pandoc\n\nAny assistance appreciated\n\nA: I am guessing, your have to extend your PATH environment variable to include\n~/.cabal/bin\n\nand then relogin afterwards.\nThis can be done in different ways. e.g.\neditor ~/.bashrc\n\nand add at the end\nexport PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH\n\n\nA: To give the usual sort of access (assuming ~/.cabal is world readable), do this:\n\nsudo ln -s $HOME/.cabal/bin/* /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s $HOME/.cabal/man/man1/*.1 /usr/local/man/man1\nsudo ln -s $HOME/.cabal/man/man5/*.5 /usr/local/man/man5\n\nThis allows man pandoc, man pandoc_markdown, man markdown2pdf.\nYou could also cp instead of ln -s, but then you'll have to repeat the copy when next you upgrade pandoc. \n", "Q: How to create a meta-package that automatically installs other packages? I'd like to be able to create a package that doesnt contain any code or programs itself, but instead installs other packages that exist in the repositories onto a computer, sort of how the ubuntu-restricted-extras package does?\n\nA: A meta-package like this can be created with a tool called equivs  which will create a package with just dependency information.\nFirst, create a directory:\nmkdir my-metapackage\ncd my-metapackage/\n\nNow run the program:\nequivs-control ns-control\n\nIt will create a file called ns-control, open this file with your text editor. \nThe control file that you generate should have its Depends or Recommends lines modified to depend on the packages that you want installed:\nSection: misc\nPriority: optional\nStandards-Version: 3.9.1\n\nPackage: my-metapackage\nVersion: 1.0   \nDepends: openssh-server, gedit\nDescription: This package installes an ssh server and a text editor\n The Long description of this package ends with a newline!\n\n(Just an example, you should include more information)\nAnd finally, build the package by running\nequivs-build ns-control\n\nYour package is located at my-metapackage/my-metapackage_1.0_all.deb. \nIf you wish to also create a source package, the --full option can be passed to equivs-build, e.g. equivs-build --full ns-control.

I would like to know if dash supports rearranging the categories that appear when one starts writing something.\nTo be more precise, I would like whatever appears from the ask ubuntu lens to be below the actual applications (for example if I write gedit, the application should be on top and the questions about it below)\nThe way it is now creates a rather \"important\" problem : since some time is needed to search askubuntu and return the answer, dash keeps changing sizes every time I press a new letter - making it impossible for me to hit the one I want.\nEDIT : In case anyone hasn't noticed, the latest update has fixed the problem, putting applications on top of custom lenses.  \n\nA: Not right now, there is no way to manually rearrange elements ATM.

I'd like to be able to disable the Ubuntu splash screen that I see on boot with the indicator meter of progress, and replace that with a text-only readout of the boot up process (such as you can get by hitting the esc key during the splash screen).  Is this possible?\nI am not asking to disable X and get to text-only login, I\"m asking how to deactivate the \"Ubuntu\" loading screen with the dots, so that I can see text output from the boot process - processes being started, kernel messages, etc.  When I wrote this question I was not asking how to disable X altogether, only the boot splash screen.\n\nA: Yes. Edit /etc/default/grub (using gksu gedit /etc/default/grub), and remove the \"quiet splash\" from the Linux command line:\nHere's what it looks like by default:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nMake it look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\n\nAfter this run sudo update-grub2\nAlso from the GRUB menu, if you want to do this temporarily, you can hit E on a line to edit it, then Ctrl+X to boot the kernel line.\nMake sure you don't have plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text package installed.\n\nA: So, I couldn't get this to work in Ubuntu 16.10 of 17.04. I used grub-customizer as well as editing the /etc/default/grub file directly (and using update-grub2 after). All the other things I could find had the same answer, remove quiet splash.\nAs it worked on a 16.04 system, I decided to compare the grub.cfg files and found an entry in the 17.04 grub.cfg file which said \"vt.handoff\". I found the following entry on this parameter;\nWhat is vt.handoff=7 parameter in grub.cfg?\nEventually I edited the grub.cfg file (which you shouldn't do because thats whatts update-grub2 is for, it will generate the grub.cfg file), but this seemed to work!\nps. removing plymooth did nothing on my system, so I added it back in. \n", "Q: Give ftp users access to directories outside their root using symlinks I tried to give proftpd virtual users access to directories outside their home paths using symlinks I created as root through the console.\n/var/ftp/users/test  is the home of the user named test.\n/var/ftp/files/documents  is the directory that holds the documents, and /var/ftp/users/test/documents   is the symlink that points to it. \nBut when an user connects to the FTP and tries to follow the symlink, he only sees this error:\ndocuments: No such file or directory\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Symlinks are locked into the jail the same way the user is; otherwise it would be possible for the user to break out of the jail with cd documents.  (No, root-created symlinks can't be treated specially, for the same reason that cd -P symlink-to-dir; cd .. leaves you in the wrong place; the appearance of it working as you'd expect is an illusion created by the shell.)  Use a bind mount instead (mount --bind /var/ftp/files/documents /var/ftp/users/test/documents).\n", "Q: New menu in Unity panel I just rebooted my computer, and now I have this menu on my Unity panel when no windows have focus.

Here is a quick video: http://vid.ly/0t1s3j\nAm I insane and this has been around the entire time? Is there a way to remove this? I haven't decided if I like it yet, but right now it seems redundant. \n\nA: This is fine. The desktop on Ubuntu is provided by Nautilus. When are are using items on your desktop, you are actually using nautilus.\nI think it is fine to have a menu for the desktop.

If nautilus allow overwrite copy handler it will be very simple to write a plugin to integrate Ultracopier.\n\nA: How to integrate ultracopier with nautilus ?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open software center and just search \"ultracop\", you will find two files for nautilus:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Advanced graphical file copy system(ultracopier)\n\n*copy files on nautilus with ultracopier(nautilus-ultracopier)\n\n\ninstall both of them and log out and login.

I have found a lot of answers to this question on the internet, tried many, but all failed one way or another. Therefore I dare to ask once again in the hope that someone here could explain it simply :)\nPre-conditions:\nIn my institute, we have a Samba server. In Windows, it is accessed by going to \\\\xyz.220.131.233\\ and entering the login abc and the password def. \nIn Ubuntu, I was able to do exactly the same using Nautilus, pressing Ctrl+L and entering smb://xyz.220.131.233/. It then asks for the login and the password and connects. I can even drag a folder from here to the 'Places' and have a shortcut to the remote location. \nSo far so good. I've just installed Matlab and want to open this remote location. Trying to cd to smb://xyz.220.131.233/ returns \n\nCannot CD to smb://xyz.220.131.233 (Name is nonexistent or not a directory).\n\nA Mac user in my group told me I first mount the location, but he didn't know how to do it. \nIs it true and how do I do it? \n\nA: In most cases:\n$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gvfs\n\n14.04:\n/run/user/$(id -u)/gvfs\n\n12.10:\n/run/user/<username>/gvfs\n\n12.04:\nSince 12.04 the folder of mounted samba share is:  \n~/.cache/gvfs\n\n11.10 and older\nYou can learn how to mount - it will sure works.  But I think this is an easier solution for you: Nautilus mount smb partitions at ~/.gvfs (where ~/ means /home/user_name/ - example: /home/desgua/.gvfs).\nYou just have to navigate to there:  \ncd ~/.gvfs\n\n\nA: Another option here, while not directly related to having mounted the directory in nautilus is to mount the location from the command line. \nHowever, to mount samba volumes, you have to have CIFS support.\nsudo apt-get install cifs-utils\n\nFrom here, you have the option of where you want to mount the location. There are TWO \"standards\" of sorts for this. If you want the location to show up in the Places menu, you would mount it in /media. If not, you would mount it in /mnt (only to follow the common namespace for mounted volumes. There’s nothing wrong with mounting the directory in /home/$user/mount/someshare)\n\nIllustration of the mounted location in the Places menu\nassuming that /media/myshare exist, you would achieve this by issuing the following command:\nsudo mount -t cifs -o user=abc,password=def //xyz.220.131.233 /media/myshare\n\nSide note\nYou can accomplish this automagically by appending the following string to your /etc/fstab configuration:\n//xyz.220.131.233 /media/SambaMount cifs username=abc,password=def,rw,user,noauto 0 0\n\nNotice the noauto flag, this will keep the volume from being mounted at boot, so when you're no longer at your workplace, it won't hang during boot trying to poll and mount that share.\n\nA: in ubuntu 16.04 and vlc 2.2.2 ; \nSelect media > Open Directory and navigate to /run/user/1000/gvfs/  << ID number (1000) can be vary on your system.\nHere you can see the shared folder name and select the folder whichever you want to add in playlist (see picture below)\n\n\nA: On 12.10 you can find the location at\n/run/user/USERNAME/gvfs/\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12.04 I'm running:\n~/.gvfs/[SHARENAME]\n\n~/.cache/ only contains a folder gvfs-burn\n\nA: Follow this page.

I'm trying to sort out how to open a multi-page tiff. The sender swears it has more than one page, but in the default viewer I'm only able to see the first page. How do I view all pages?\n\nA: The display utility from the ImageMagick-6 suite of tools can be used to view a multi-page tiff file.  I use the following command to view the tiff files scanned using a HP 8270 multi-function printer:\ndisplay -rotate 90 -resize 1920x1080 Musings.tif\n\nThe display utility has many command line options, of which I found the above necessary.  -resize, which is a bit finicky as to what resolution it accepts, permits viewing the entire image at a reduced resolution without scrolling.\nTo turn pages, right-click anywhere on the image, then without releasing the button, move the cursor down to Next or Former on the context-menu, then release the button.  I have not yet found a menu that directly moves to any page/image within the file; however, there may be a command-line option for selecting which images to view. (The display man page is rather cryptic due to its brevity.)  \nAlso, the tiff-tools package has a number of utilities, of which the following are particularly useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*tiffcp : copy or concatenate images from one tiff file to another, optionally selecting and resequencing images from the input file(s).\n\n*tiffinfo : display the metadata for every image in a tiff.\n\n*tiffsplit : split a tiff file into individual files, each containing a single image.\n\n\nHere is an example of using tiffcp to create a new tiff file containing selected images from one file and all images from another:\ntiffcp Musings-1.tif,5,6,0,1,2,3,4  Musings-2.tif Musings_new.tif\n\nThe tiff-tools package also has a number of other utilities for editing and converting images in tiff files. \n\nA: Evince is supposed to open multipage tiffs. If not, another application to try is imview found in the Software Center.\n\nA: evince did not work for me.\nI found that the program okular works for multipage tiff's.\n", "Q: Audio problem on some flash videos I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 on my 64-bit laptop, and I have Adobe Flash 10,2,161,22 installed.  \nThe vast majority of the time, I've no problems with flash videos in terms of both video and audio.

Hope it answers your question\n", "Q: Should I use No-Script? I hear that web-browsing is the most likely origin of malware on a computer these days. I also hear that one doesn't need to worry about viruses on Linux. So, should I use a browser extension that allows me to selectively enable javascript for favoured domains, such as No-Script or Not-Script?\n\nA: In theory you can get viruses on Linux and Mac OS. The reason most people don't is because Linux and Mac OS are not big targets. The malware writers want to cast a wide net with minimal effort. Secondarily Linux/Unix offer more in the way of security and better informed users (in general). That being said I use Flashblock and No Script on Windows, Mac OS X and Ubuntu at all times. Pages load faster, it helps with online anonymity by preventing flash cookies and all manner of other issues. I highly recommend them, regardless of platform. At minimum they make you more aware of what pages are trying to do.\n\nA: I use NoScript regularly on Firefox, and recommend it for daily use.\nIt doesn't block ads, so you still support the site costs for their administrators.\nHowever, it does block flash ads, greatly reducing your CPU load when browsing (provided that you have the flash plugin installed)\nYou can individually allow content to run, so most video sharing sites will start to work after you allow the scripts related to video playback (This may take a bit of guessing if there are several scripts on the page). The permissions you grant may be temporary for the session, or permanent so the site will work unless you decide to block them again.\nWhen filling out forms such as site registrations, it's a good idea to allow the scripts before filling out the forms so you don't have to repeat your work. Allowing a script on a page forces a reload of the page.\nThe most important protection NoScript grants you is from malicious sites that try to change your window size, post content to social sites or do anything else unwanted. NoScript changes the default action to denied, and you can choose per-site if you judge that the scripts are trustworthy.\nHere's the install link for Firefox:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/\n\nA: Definitely!\nAttackers can use malicious scripts to perform multiple attacks such as XSS:\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications that enables malicious attackers to inject client-side script into web pages viewed by other users...\n\nRead more in wikipedia.\nNo script give you the power to control all the scripts on a web page (or a website) and the plugins it uses such as flash, java, etc. You add trusted sites to a whitelist and the other are not allowed to run scripts, unless you let them (temporarily or permanently).\n\nA question and it's answer on no-script website (faq) can provide some clarifications:\nWhy should I allow JavaScript, Java, Flash and plugin execution only for trusted sites? \n\nJavaScript, Java and Flash, even being very different technologies, do have one thing in common: they execute on your computer code coming from a remote site.\n  All the three implement some kind of sandbox model, limiting the activities remote code can perform: e.g., sandboxed code shouldn't read/write your local hard disk nor interact with the underlying operating system or external applications.\n  Even if the sandboxes were bullet proof (not the case, read below) and even if you or your operating system wrap the whole browser with another sandbox (e.g. IE7+ on Vista or Sandboxie), the mere ability of running sandboxed code inside the browser can be exploited for malicious purposes, e.g. to steal important information you store or enter on the web (credit card numbers, email credentials and so on) or to \"impersonate\" you, e.g. in fake financial transactions, launching \"cloud\" attacks like Cross Site Scripting (XSS) or CSRF, with no need for escaping your browser or gaining privileges higher than a normal web page. This alone is enough reason to allow scripting on trusted sites only.\n  Moreover, many security exploits are aimed to achieve a \"privilege escalation\", i.e. exploiting an implementation error of the sandbox to acquire greater privileges and perform nasty task like installing trojans, rootkits and keyloggers.\n  This kind of attack can target JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins as well:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*JavaScript looks like a very precious tool for bad guys: most of the fixed browser-exploitable vulnerabilities discovered to date were ineffective if JavaScript was disabled. Maybe the reason is that scripts are easier to test and search for holes, even if you're a newbie hacker: everybody and his brother believe to be a JavaScript programmer :P\n  \n*Java has a better history, at least in its \"standard\" incarnation, the Sun JVM.There have been viruses, instead, written for the Microsoft JVM, like the ByteVerifier.Trojan. Anyway, the Java security model allows signed applets (applets whose integrity and origin are guaranteed by a digital certificate) to run with local privileges, i.e. just like they were regular installed applications. This, combined with the fact there are always users who, in front of a warning like \"This applet is signed with a bad/fake certificate. You DON'T want to execute it! Are you so mad to execute it, instead? [Never!] [Nope] [No] [Maybe]\", will search, find and hit the \"Yes\" button, caused some bad reputation even to Firefox (notice that the article is quite lame, but as you can imagine had much echo).\n  \n*Flash used to be considered relatively safe, but since its usage became so widespread severe security flaws have been found at higher rate. Flash applets have also been exploited to launch XSS attacks against the sites where they're hosted.>\n  \n*Other plugins are harder to exploit, because most of them don't host a virtual machine like Java and Flash do, but they can still expose holes like buffer overruns that may execute arbitrary code when fed with a specially crafted content. Recently we have seen several of these plugin vulnerabilities, affecting Acrobat Reader, Quicktime, RealPlayer and other multimedia helpers.\nPlease notice that none of the aforementioned technologies is usually (95% of the time) affected by publicly known and still unpatched exploitable problems, but the point of NoScript is just this: preventing exploitation of even unknown yet security holes, because when they are discovered it may be too late ;)\n  The most effective way is disabling the potential threat on untrusted sites.\n\n", "Q: How to make this heart (♥) using keyboard? On windows I have always used the \"ALT+3\" for creating a wonderful heart for expressing my love...  \nIs there a way to do this on Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you know a character's code point, you can enter the character (at least in most/all GTK apps) by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+u and then its code point number.\nSo to make the \"♥\" character, hold down CTRL and SHIFT while pressing u, then type 2665.\nThere are many ways to get a character's unicode code point.  For example you can, look it up on wikipedia.  You can do this by copy-pasting it into their search box, or using a URL like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=♥  They may not have entries for all characters, but I've yet to look one up that didn't have an entry providing the code point.  I'm sure you could also dig up a comprehensive chart somewhere.\nYou can also use a programming language.  For example:\n$ python\nPython 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Sep 15 2010, 16:22:56) \n[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\nunicode>>> unicode('♥', 'utf-8')\nu'\\u2665'\n\nor more concisely\n$ python -c 'print repr(unicode(\"♥\", \"utf-8\"))'\nu'\\u2665'\n\nIf for some reason you need to generate the character without using the CTRL-SHIFT-u trick, you can do\n$ python -c 'print u\"\\u2665\".encode(\"utf-8\")'\n♥\n\n\nA: I use compose keys for all those special characters outside the English language.  You can also type a heart with them.\nSystem -> Preferences -> Keyboard Preferences\nTab \"Layouts\", button \"Options\", choose a \"Compose Key Position\" (I set it to Right Alt)\nNow, anywhere you can type Right Alt + < followed by 3 (or your compose key of choice instead of the Right Alt of course)\n♥\nbtw, don't overdo the hearts...\nThis works intuitively for all kinds of special characters!\nRight Alt + c and = gives €\nRight Alt + s and s gives ß\nEDIT:\nYou can find more compose key sequences here\n\nA: *\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+U 2 6 6 5 Enter\nControl-capital-u means Unicode, and the four-digit hexadecimal number for a \"black heart suit\" (or any other Unicode character) can be found via the Character Map in Ubuntu (gucharmap). \n\n\n*\n\n*See also: How can I type a Unicode character (for example, em-dash —?)\n", "Q: How do I remove wifi functionality?

If so, you can tape the switch to the \"Off\" position, which will deactivate your wifi until you turn kill switch back to the operating position.\n", "Q: Should I force enable hardware acceleration in the browser? Neither firefox nor chromium have hardware acceleration enabled by default right now. Firefox 4 has an option its registry to force it:  layers.acceleration.force.enabled , which is  by default set to false. \nHaving passed all but 3 of 800 tests run by the grafx bot, I thought it reasonable to set the above registry entry to true. However I get a terrible score in the FPS test at the mozilla hardware acceleration stress test. But it doesn't seem to give any problems in normal usage.\nSimilarly gpu acceleration can be enabled in Chromium 10 by navigating to about:flags and checking the option. So, should I enable it or not?\n\nA: I have it enabled on both on my system.

To get the default functionality of the function keys, I need to press fn+Function key.\nThis is quite annoying since I frequently use the function keys for debugging.\nIs there any way I can get the default functionality out of the function keys, i.e., get the effect of pressing the Fn key without having to actually press it?\n\nA: From the Ubuntu community wiki on Apple Keyboards...\nOpen this file with root permissions in terminal:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf\n\nThen add to the end of the file:\n\noptions hid_apple fnmode=2\n\nAnd then finally in terminal...\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nReboot your computer.\nThis will change the default keys to being the Function keys, E.g F8 is F8 instead of Play/Pause song. Hope this helps! ^.^\n\nA: Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 running (quite well, actuallyNote 1) on a 2008 MacBook White, but should work on any version of Ubuntu:\nFirst, try this command from this answer:\nsudo su -c \"echo -n 0x02 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode\"\n\nIf it works, great! The problem is you'll have to manually run it every time you reboot your computer.\nSo, let's make it persistent by adding it to our /etc/rc.local file, which gets run as root during every boot:\nEdit (or create and edit, if running Ubuntu 18.04 or later) the /etc/rc.local user startup file:\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nCopy and paste the following line into the file just before the exit 0 line at the end:\necho -n 0x02 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode\n\nIf your /etc/rc.local file is empty (as it would be on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04, for instance, since they don't come with this file installed), copy and paste these entire contents into the file, as this is what it should look like when you're done:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\necho -n 0x02 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode\n\nexit 0\n\nEnsure the file is executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\nNow reboot your PC.\nDone! Every time you reboot your PC, the /etc/rc.local file automatically gets run as root, calling the echo -n 0x02 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode command as root, thereby fixing the fn Function key problem! Now, your F1, F2, F3 etc. keys work as function keys by default, and you must use the fn key with them to call their special functions, rather than the other way around.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*How do I activate Function Keys without pressing the fn button in the mac keyboard?\n\n*https://vpsfix.com/community/server-administration/no-etc-rc-local-file-on-ubuntu-18-04-heres-what-to-do/\nNote 1: Be sure to disable animations in Ubuntu 20.04 if running it on a slow or old computer such as a 2008 MacBook, as I am doing, or else it doesn't run nearly as well.

Both CompizConfig and the Nvidia X Server settings have options to enable Sync to VBlank. By enabling the Benchmark option in Compiz I can see that ticking \"enable sync to vblank\" under General in Compiz will keep the Frames to 30 per second. Unticked, it is about 60. However, choosing the equivalent option in the OpenGL tab of Nvidia X settings doesn't seem to have any effect. Which option(s) should I enable?\n\nA: It appears that when you are using Compiz, Nvidia X Server settings' Vblank option does not work. If you are using Compiz then select the sync to VBlank in the Compiz Settings. Otherwise use Nvidia's setting. VBlank is useful for watching videos and playing games if you experience \"screen tearing\" which is horizontal lines occasionally distorting your video. Enabling Sync to VBlank will usually fix the screen tearing issues. \n", "Q: Hotot Direct Messaging Issue Everytime I DM (direct message), it gets posted in the public timeline as well.

Is there a way to install MD5 in Ubuntu without using apt-get?\n\nA: You don't have to install anything. The coreutils package is a dependency of the Kernel amongst almost a dozen other very standard packages. You'd have to fight quite hard to remove the package.\nYou use it through md5sum which by default takes a file as its main argument. It's fairly easy to use it in an interactive setting though:\noli@bert:~$ md5sum - <<<\"This is a test hash\"\n6b7cf77ca6403a2323e5fd98a462538e  -\n\noli@bert:~$ echo \"This is a test hash\" | md5sum \n6b7cf77ca6403a2323e5fd98a462538e  -\n\nBut it has other functions, run man md5sum to see them.\nTL;DR: it's installed by default.\n\nA: What's wrong with apt-get?

I tried to download python 2.6 using apt-get, but the package is not available. \nIs there any way to use python 2.6 in ubuntu 8.04? \n\nA: It is likely that you will be building Python 2.6 from source one way or another. I found a guide located at http://www.lysium.de/blog/index.php?/archives/229-Installing-Python-2.6-on-Ubuntu-8.04.html which seems as though it would benefit you. \n\nA: 8.04 is a pretty old distribution.  It might not run python 2.6 efficiently.  Python 2.6 is standard in 10.04, you could upgrade directly from the 8.04 LTS to the 10.04 LTS.\n", "Q: How do I write raw bytes to a sound-device? In the olden days, you used to be able to open /dev/dsp for reading and writing, now, with PulseAudio this doesn't work anymore.\nI thought you could do it with padsp, but this code doesn't run:\nimport ossaudiodev\n\nf = ossaudiodev.open(\"w\")\nfmt, channels, rate = dsp.setparameters(fmt, channels, rate)\n\n(running it via padsp python script.py)\nThe error I get is No such file or directory: '/dev/dsp'.\nWhat am I missing? How do I read and write raw bytes from and to a sound device, and how do I select which one I want to use?\n\nA: This script is a thin wrapper around PulseAudio's Simple API. It allows you to write samples to the default output:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport random\nimport ctypes\nimport struct\n\nclass NoiseMaker (object):\n\n    PA_SAMPLE_U8 = 0\n    PA_STREAM_PLAYBACK = 1\n\n    def __init__(self, rate, channels):\n        pat_sample_spec = ctypes.c_buffer(struct.pack(\"LLB\",\n            self.PA_SAMPLE_U8, rate, channels))\n        self.pa = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(\"libpulse-simple.so.0\")\n        self.s = self.pa.pa_simple_new(0, \"App\", self.PA_STREAM_PLAYBACK,\n            0, \"App Noise\", ctypes.byref(pat_sample_spec), 0, 0,0)\n\n    def write(self, data):\n        self.pa.pa_simple_write(self.s, data, len(data), 0)\n\n    def __del__(self):\n        self.pa.pa_simple_free(self.s)\n\n\none_second_noise = bytes(random.randint(0, 255) for i in range(44100*2))\nNoiseMaker(44100, 2).write(one_second_noise)\n\nThe rate (44100) defines how many samples there are in a second of real time. It expects bytes in the range of 0-255 inclusive, which is defined by PA_SAMPLE_U8 (equivalent to 'Unsigned 8-Bit' as shown by Audacity, for example). If you have more than one channel, it expects alternating samples for each of them. So, one second of noise has 44100 samples per channel = 88200 samples, where the (modulo 2 = 0) ones are for the left channel.\nPlease note that this script runs only on Python 3\n", "Q: /usr/lib/apt/methods/http eating my bandwidth! I've noticed (using nethogs), that /usr/lib/apt/methods/http has multiple processes, which consume ALL of my bandwidth. I want to disable the process(es).  \nI've tried everything: trickle, killall, etc., but nothing has worked.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: It is because, in Ubuntu 16.04 when there are security updates available for it, it automatically downloads and install them without notifying the user.\nTo disable this functionality you can visit Software & Update and under Update tab, change when there are security updates to Display immediately.\n\n\nA: apt does have (or at least, did have) configurable options for this. Run this from a terminal.\nsudoedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/76download\n\nAnd paste in the following:\nAcquire\n{\n    Queue-mode \"access\";\n    http\n    {\n        Dl-Limit \"50\";\n    };\n};\n\nThat will limit apt-get (over HTTP) to 50KB/s but just change the Dl-Limit value to whatever suits your circumstances best. Save the file and you're done.\n\nA: Probably the software updates are downloaded in the background, you can disable this feature in the settings of the Update Manager.\n\nA: If you want to kill the process simply run the following command:\nsudo kill PID\n\nReplace PID with the process ID that you can find in nethogs or top.\nBut as you know this process is for updating Ubuntu and killing it will not upgrade your system and you should manually run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade later on.\n\nA: My bandwidth (15GB / month) was getting killed by this as well. Major usage, like 2-3 GB per day.

How can I edit the Locale file to fix this problem without being able to boot?\n\nA: Boot into the Recovery mode, and if that doesn't work, into a LiveCD. Then edit the file, there should be something like\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\n(depending on your locale).

The one problem I have is with HDMI Audio Out. \nAfter I plug in the HDMI cable (or boot with it plugged in), I go to System > Preferences > Sound\nUnder the \"Hardware\" tab, I can select \"Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output\", but then the only entry under the \"Output\" tab is \"Dummy Output.\" I don't hear any sound out of the TV speakers, and if I press \"Test Speakers,\" the Sound dialog crashes. \nhere's the output of aplay -l\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ aplay -l\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC269 Analog [ALC269 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 1: ALC269 Digital [ALC269 Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 3: INTEL HDMI 0 [INTEL HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nHow can I get HDMI Audio Output to work?\n\nA: One difference between the live cd and your install could be the kernel modules that are loaded. You could check using lsmod | grep hda or lsmod | grep hdmi and see if there is any difference between the output on your install versus the live cd.\nI don't have a maverick install, but I know with Lucid I have to explicitly load the newer ALSA drivers and kernel modules from a different PPA in order to get HDMI sound to work. \n", "Q: Why doesn't Preferred Applications include an image application? You can use \"Preferred Applications\" to set your media player, web browser, etc, but why does it not provide an option for images?\nYou can use Ubuntu Tweak to set the image viewer for all of the different image types, but it would be nice to have it built into Ubuntu.\nIs there a technical limitation? (If it's possible with various audio/video types, I don't see what makes images more difficult.)\nOr is it just a too much to do and not enough resources problem?\n\nA: After reading some mailinglist posts, I think the Preferred Applications dialog was probably implemented to control what applications are launched for the media keys on your keyboard (web key, mail key, play/pause keys). The other two settings (terminal and accessibility) are also used by hotkeys.\nOf course none of these options are exclusively for hotkeys, but I guess that's where their use comes from.\n", "Q: How to resolve dependencies when compiling a software from source What are the best tools for resolving unmet dependencies when compiling from source?

Is Mono and/or Mono-based software bloatware? \nEg: Banshee, Moonlight, Docky, Tomboy Notes, etc.\nIs there anything actually wrong with software using Mono and/or Mono itself, or is it nothing more than an ethics issue?\n\nA: Mono is a free software implementation of an open EMCA standard.\nFeatures include:\n\n\n*\n\n*JIT (just in time compiling)\n\n*Garbage collection and memory management\n\n*Type safety\n\n\nTogether these features help to provide a more reliable, safer program with less likelihood for memory leaks.\nThis comes at the cost of a small and efficient shared runtime.\nHaving said that software bloat is much more about how you use a language then what the language actually is.\nI'm not sure how ethics is relevant. \n\nA: This issue has been raised over and over again. Let me take a bold step and attempt to bury it.\nFirstly C#, Boo, IronPython etc, are all just languages. The VM they run on introduces a thin layer, which in the case of modern systems is practically negligible. If a programmer writes well done, efficient code, then the application should in essence run as any native program would; smoothly, cleanly. Also, it should not introduce extra bloat; in fact sometimes the binary size on disk may be smaller.\nIn essence, the argument is pointless. Mono, Python, Perl, Java - etc, they are not bloatware. They are software.\nWhat is bloatware? Badly written software.\n", "Q: How well-supported is the Canon CanoScan LiDE110?

Am I reading this wrong or is the list just not specifying enough information to me?\n\nA: Am pretty sure that is a typo in the SANE list because for what i have seen, some of the scanners there like some Stylus, Scanjet and maybe others do not appear in the list updated as they should be. I have in the place i work several of them and they work 100% good but in the SANE page they do not mention this. Am guessing the page is old or when they did the update they forgot some of them.

It's a Thinkpad X120e and this is what dmesg says:\n[   14.821482] Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1, fw: 7.5, id: 0x1e0b1, caps: 0xd000b3/0x340000/0xa0400\n[   14.821498] serio: Synaptics pass-through port at isa0060/serio4/input0\n[   14.864676] input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad as /devices/platform/i8042/serio4/input/input7\n\n\nA: You can install utouch-geis-tools and then run geistest, which shows you information about the device and gestures, e.g.:\nDevice 10 added\n    attr \"device name\" = \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n    attr \"device id\" = 10\n    attr \"direct touch\" = false\n    attr \"independent touch\" = false\n    attr \"device touches\" = 4\n    ....\n\nwhere the last attribute is defined as the number of simultaneous touches the devices claims to be able to recognize.\nHowever, uTouch doesn't seem to recognize more than two fingers on my system (ThinkPad T510), because geistest always shows\n    ...\n    attr \"gesture name\" = \"Tap,touch=2\"\n    ...\n\nwhen doing three or four finger taps, but I don't know if that's a hardware or software limitation (I just made this a bug report).\n\nA: Touchegg from http://code.google.com/p/touchegg/ lets you use multitouch gestures\nIf it works correctly (it doesn't on my end) it should let you test how many fingers you can use.\n(by the way, if you just want to know if the touchpad supports multitouch, why don't you just check the specs?)\n\nA: As an update to htorque's answer, you must now use geis-tools instead of utouch-geis-tools (> 12.04). So run the following set of commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install geis-tools\ngeisview\n\nIn the new window, go under Device<device_id>Added:<device_name> (Probably the last option) and check device touches: <finger_number>. finger_number will tell you the number of multi-touch fingers your touchpad supports.\n", "Q: Remote application in ubuntu?

I'll start my saying that although I've used Ubuntu for a number of years I've rarely taken the time to explore Linux under the hood. I've been content to rely on GUI tools for most of my needs, only resorting to a terminal when a suitable GUI tool could not be found.\nA few weeks back I did a default install of the Zentyal (ebox) distro and set up an email server for a school. Unfortunately, the default file system configuration allocated only three partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ - 6GB\n\n*swap - 4GB\n\n*/home - 96GB\n\n\nAfter being in operation for only a few weeks the root parition has filled and has taken the server to its knees. So I need to find a way to either resize or free up space in the root partition.\nI've been able to figure out that the space hog is /var, the file system was setup using lvm and that both / and /home are in the same volume group. I've attempted booting from a live cd so I could shrink /home and enlarge /. I'm more comfortable with GUI tools so I used system-config-lvm. The odd thing is that from the live cd it showed the /home partition (or volume or whatever its called) as not having a file system at all. When I log in normally I can see that it is in fact using ext4.\nThis server is running as a vmware guest so I made a snapshot and went ahead and tried to resize. Everything appeared to resize without error however, after rebooting I was informed that /home could no longer be mounted. The only account that needs the /home folder is the server administrator (me) but apparently Zentyal must use it for something because I couldn't access Zentyal's web interface and the server wasn't receiving any emails.\nSo I reverted to the snapshot I had taken and here I sit. No closer to solving this problem than I was before.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Since you went back to the previous Snapshot you could boot from a LIVE CD that supports LVM Partitions (Like \nSYSTEM RESCUE CD ) maybe read a little just to start on working with LVM Partitions. Anyway the normal steps there are after booting from the live cd (This are going to be several command lines not gui bases):\n\n\n*\n\n*Do NOT mount any of the LVM (Obvious reasons. you are going to resize it so do not mounted yet.)\n\n*Do a fsck to the partition you want to change. Just in case.\n\n*First do e2fsck -f PARTITION\n\n*Since we want to remove space from /home and give it to root we do:\n4.1. Do resize2fs PARTITION SIZE or resize2fs -f PARTITION SIZE to the HOME partition before you use lvreduce on it. Remember that you MUST have enough space free for the final size after the resize is made. Do a resize2fs -p on the new home partition size just to make sure it has the correct block size.\n4.2 Use lvextend on the ROOT partition and then do resize2fs PARTITION SIZE or resize2fs -f PARTITION SIZE on it. And do again a resize2fs -p on it to make sure it has the correct block size.\n\n\nNOTE - After doing lvreduce or lvextend to each partition you need to do e2fsck -fn to force a check on the partition for consistency (It will read-only the partition and check if even if it is clean)  \nAn example for the lvm tools:  \nlvreduce -L -35G \"Home Partition\" - Home Partition will have 35GB less.\nlvextend -L +35G \"Root Partition\" - Root Partition will have 35GB more.\nHope this helps in figuring out how to do it and with the snapshots am guessing you will.\nUPDATE - After doing a curious search found another user from Red Hat, similar problem: https://serverfault.com/questions/13666/how-can-i-resize-a-lvm-partition-in-red-hat-without-lose-of-data\nUPDATE2 - Added what psusi says in the comments since THAT is the correct way and i need to drink coffee before reading/writing something.\nUPDATE3 - Thank psusi below for the several corrections.\nNOTE - This is for partitions made with ext2/3/4 and am guessing blocks that are not 1K/2K since i read somewhere that it did not work for them (Not tested since i have 512 Bytes)\n\nA: try to use following steps:-\n1_sudo  apt-get install gparted\n\n\n*\n\n*then simply go to system-administration- system partition\n\n\nthen do as per need and with gui \n", "Q: Can I move the Unity launcher?

Here’s a quote from Mark on the bug report for Ubuntu 11.04: \n\nI think the report actually meant that the launcher should be movable to\n  other edges of the screen. I’m afraid that won’t work with our broader\n  design goals, so we won’t implement that. We want the launcher always\n  close to the Ubuntu button.\n\nI interpret that as a stand that a consistent design must be experienced as a Unity (pun intended), or it won't work at all.\nWhile I personally disagree with Mark’s/Canonical’s decision not to provide a way to move the launcher (please read my final note on this), I do understand the design choice: it truly makes sense for it to be on the side and not at the bottom. Most users today have a widescreen monitor, and virtually all monitors for sale, specially for end-user consumer market, are widescreen too. That means the vast majority of users have lots of extra horizontal space (mostly underused), while vertical space is premium.\nMost apps and websites do not use your whole screen width (check the large vertical background bars in both sides of screen of Ask Ubuntu, for example). But they do use the full vertical length (actually, they scroll 3, 5, 10 times your screen height). Meaning lots and lots of scrolling. And then you subtract title bar, menu bar, favorites bar, tabs bar, etc., all of them sucking up your precious vertical space. So adding the launcher on top/bottom would make things even worse, while there’s plenty of extra, “idle” horizontal space.\nThere is an ongoing, strong movement in app development, specially browsers, towards reducing the number of bars and merging them together. Think about how Firefox changed in this regard in the last few years. So it makes sense for an OS to do the same.\nTrue, Windows’ panel is a well-crafted one… but the design choice of Unity to put it at side and not the bottom is a wise one, once you get used to it. And it’s worth doing so. Your mouse wheel will say thanks ;)\nThat said, some important notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am just expressing Mark’s/Canonical’s statements and point of view. While I do understand the design choice, and I do agree with a side launcher, I certainly do not agree with the decision of not being able to move it. But I’m just a messenger. Don’t shoot the messenger.\n\n*There are unofficial, third-party packages that allow you to move the launcher. This other answer covers that in great depth.\n\n*You can, at least, have some control over the launcher in a multi-monitor setup:\n\n(image edited from Ubuntu Vibes)\n", "Q: Minimal server installation I am currently running Ubuntu Server 10.10 through a virtual machine to use as a stack for web development and a chance to get to grips with the Ubuntu command line, however I'd really like to set up a clean, minimal install with only the bare minimum of core utilities so I can get only what I need as I go along.\nThe Ubuntu Server iso seems to install a lot of extras already and I'd prefer just the bare minimum so I can spend more time aquainting myself with the installation and set up of the packages I need.

Firefox has been the default browser for ages. Thunderbird is a very popular e-mail client under consideration for being included as default in the future. Notify OSD has been around for years now.\nWhat went wrong that in that long timeframe such important applications do not have such an important and visible feature implemented? This is very inconsistent. When will we see it integrated?\n\nA: Firefox and Thunderbird are not maintained by Canonical but by the Mozilla Foundation. It is up to the Mozilla Foundation to implement support for notify-osd, not Canonical. The problem is that many distributions use different notification systems. There are even differences between Gnome and KDE, and Windows also uses a different notification system. To be able to support all of these is a lot of work.\n\nA: I just want to clarify something - notify-osd is just one implementation of the Freedesktop Notification spec. Applications actually use libnotify, which allows them to integrate with the notification system (which could be notify-osd, the legacy notification-daemon or any other implementation of the spec)\nBoth Thunderbird and Firefox already have native support for libnotify. However, they fall back to XUL notifications when communicating with a notification system which doesn't support actions (ie, notify-osd). This is because the types of notifications provided by Firefox and Thunderbird show information that is only really useful if the actual notification allows the user to interact with it (eg, \"download finished\" should provide a way for the user to access the downloaded file. A \"new mail\" notification should provide a way to access the new mail, and be persistent).\nMaking Thunderbird and Firefox use libnotify when the notification system doesn't support actions would provide a very sub-optimal experience if we made no other UI changes.\nThere is already ongoing work to integrate Thunderbird in to the messaging menu. Part of this will involve having new-mail alerts via notify-osd. Persistence will be provided by the messaging menu.\nIn addition to this, I will at some point start work on integrating download notifications in Firefox with notify-osd and the Unity launcher (with the launcher being able to show a progressbar, and use quicklists as a way to access finished downloads). This work hasn't started yet and will be something I do for the 11.10 cycle.\n\nA: There is an addon for thunderbird already (libnotify-popups I believe) that uses osd-notify whenever you get new mail\n", "Q: CLI Screenshot/Streaming screen is there any way how i can make a screenshot of CLI command \"screen -r\", then save it as .txt?

When I start on my desktop which is about two years old, everything works like a charm. \nWhen I start on my new laptop (MSI gt680r system), it slows down after I wake up the computer from sleep, or if I plug another usb disk.\nKworker processes take more and more cpu, and the mouse freezes from time to time.\nI have read several solutions on various forums that did not work. \nI went into the bios of my laptop, where there was:\nHand XCHI OFF: Enabled\nEHCI Hand OFF: disabled\n\nI changed for:\nHand XCHI OFF: disabled\nEHCI Hand OFF: disabled\n\nand since that, it doesn't freeze anymore on natty on my laptop.  \nI would enable hand back if and when the problem is corrected.\n\nA: \"kworker\" is a placeholder process for kernel worker threads, which perform most of the actual processing for the kernel, especially in cases where there are interrupts, timers, I/O, etc.  These typically correspond to the vast majority of any allocated \"system\" time to running processes.  It is not something that can be safely removed from the system in any way, and is completely unrelated to nepomuk or KDE (except in that these programs may make system calls, which may require the kernel to do something).\nThere were some reports of excessive kworker activity for relatively\nidle systems starting during 2.6.36 development (example discussion), and wide reports of confusion and problems with 2.6.38 (although many of these reports include the word \"Natty\", so I presume these people not to have used any kernel between 2.6.35 (distributed in Ubuntu 10.10) and 2.6.38 (distributed in Ubuntu 11.04).\nI've found many reports of something that \"fixed\" this for one or another user.  Most \"fixes\" seem to be related to updates of the kernel of various sorts.  Where the update can be tracked to a specific issue, it seems to often be some driver or kernel service that has been patched to not misbehave: I have the impression that there are a very large number of things in the kernel that can cause a behaviour which is observed as excessive kworker usage.\nIf you find the system unusable due to excessive kworker activity, I would recommend trying to do fewer things.  If you think you're not doing anything, try shutting down long-running services or timers (RSS readers, mail readers, file indexers, activity trackers, etc.).  If this doesn't work, try restarting.  If your system allows you to enable or disable hardware in a pre-boot environment, try turning off hardware you aren't using.  If it happens on every restart before you do anything, you could try uninstalling things, but at this point you'll want to be running syscall profiling tools to track down specific applications that seem to be causing this overload.\nIt is to be hoped that your specific system will stop expressing this behaviour with a future kernel upgrade (and many of the most common causes of this have been solved).\n\nA: Just to let everyone know.   I ran into this issue, installed perf (which is a great tool), it pointed to spin locking and XFS.  That pointed to NFS.   Then I realized one of my mounts was out of space.   Freeing up space caused kworker CPU to drop to 0.   \nSo apparently this can be a symptom of running out of drive space on a busy NFS server!\n\nA: What is kworker? kworker means a Linux kernel process doing \"work\" (processing system calls). You can have several of them in your process list: kworker/0:1 is the one on your first CPU core, kworker/1:1 the one on your second etc..\nWhy does kworker hog your CPU? To find out why a kworker is wasting your CPU, you can create CPU backtraces: watch your processor load (with top or something) and in moments of high load through kworker, execute echo l > /proc/sysrq-trigger to create a backtrace. (On Ubuntu, this needs you to login with sudo -s). Do this several times, then watch the backtraces at the end of dmesg output. See what happens frequently in the CPU backtraces, it hopefully points you to the source of your problem.\nExample: e1000e. In my case, I found a backtrace like this nearly every time:\nCall Trace:\n delay_tsc+0x4a/0x80\n __const_udelay+0x2c/0x30\n e1000_acquire_swflag_ich8lan+0xa2/0x240 [e1000e]\n e1000e_read_phy_reg_igp+0x29/0x80 [e1000e]\n e1000e_phy_has_link_generic+0x85/0x120 [e1000e]\n e1000_check_for_copper_link_ich8lan+0x48/0x930 [e1000e]\n e1000e_has_link+0x55/0xd0 [e1000e]\n e1000_watchdog_task+0x5e/0x960 [e1000e]\n\nIt hinted me to a problem in the e1000e Ethernet card module, and indeed a sudo rmmod e1000e made the high CPU load go away immediately [e1000e bug #26].\n\nA: I think disabling Nepomuk can help you:\nhttp://www.freetechie.com/blog/disable-nepomuk-desktop-search-on-kde-4-4-2-kubuntu-lucid-10-04/\n", "Q: Bash script to start and then shutdown/restart various processes When I start up my development environment, there are a variety of processes I need to run in the background. It is a pain to start them all individually so I want to write a script that starts each one. I can do this just fine but the problem comes when I need to restart them (something I will need to do regularly).\nWhat is the easiest way to capture the process upon starting it and saving that information so that when I run the script again, it will check to see if that information has been saved and then close down those processes before restarting them.\nI also want the script to be flexible enough such that if I shutdown the process manually, it will a) not throw an error if it can't find the process and b) not accidentally shut down some other process that has since then shared whatever identifying information I have stored.\nUpdate\nMore specifically, I want to at least do the following at the moment:\n1) Type a short command like \"start-dev\"\n2) Execute the following (Note that I want the second and third commands to run in the background and am using & to do so but not the final command as I want to see the output from passenger as it runs):\n\n\n*\n\n*Change to my working directory\n\n*Start faye as a background process\n\n*Start watchr as a background process\n\n*Start passenger\n\n\nSo far I have got this\n#!/bin/bash\ncd ~/path/to/my/working-directory\nrackup faye.ru -s thin -E production &\nwatch refresh.watchr &\npassenger start\n\nThis works fine but the problem comes when I need to restart all these processes. I first have to track down all their process ids and then kill them before running start-dev again. Therefore I would like to:\n4) Type a short command like \"restart-dev\" which tracks down the processes I have previously run in the background and then kill them before running \"start-dev\" again. It needs to be able to not throw an error if I have shut down any of these manually and not accidentally shutdown an incorrect process. \n\nA: I'd tackle it something like this.\n#!/bin/bash  \n\nstartme() {\n    cd ~/path/to/my/working-directory\n    rackup faye.ru -s thin -E production &\n    watch refresh.watchr &\n    passenger start\n}\n\nstopme() {\n    pkill -f \"rackup faye.ru\" \n    pkill -f \"watch refresh.watchr\"\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in \n    start)   startme ;;\n    stop)    stopme ;;\n    restart) stopme; startme ;;\n    *) echo \"usage: $0 start|stop|restart\" >&2\n       exit 1\n       ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: I'd say you probably want to have a go at writing an upstart script to manage these processes. Upstart is a tool that is perfect for managing system daemons but also lends itself to any sort of process where you want to be able to control its status.\nAn upstart script will keep track of a process but it also lets you script things to happen before you stop it.\nstop on runlevel [06]\nexpect fork\nrespawn\n\nscript\n    # run your process here\n    # you might want to su to change user from root\nend script\n\npre-stop script\n    # things in here will run before the command is halted\nend script\n\nSave that as /etc/init/devenvironment.conf and then you should be able to control it with:\nsudo start devenvironment\nsudo stop devenvironment\nsudo restart devenvironment\n\n", "Q: Rename a file during install of a Debian package I have a python script that I want to package for Debian. I use a debian/install file where I wrote\nauto_dice.py /usr/bin/\n\nLinitan then complains about the .py extension (script-with-language-extension).\nI then changed it to\nauto_dice.py /usr/bin/autodice.py\n\nwhich causes an error because it interpreted autodice.py as a directory.\nHow can I do the rename there? I do not want to rename my python script in the sources. \n\nA: From Debian bug 245554 already mentioned:\n\nthis can already be easily solved if you use dh >= 9\n  and dh-exec. Just make your .install file executable, \n  add #!/usr/bin/dh-exec \n  to the top, and you can use \"source => dest\", like\n  this:\n\n#!/usr/bin/dh-exec\ndebian/default.conf => /etc/my-package/start.conf\n\n\nA: You cannot rename files using dh_install (via the debian/install). You will need to rename it during the debian/rules \"build\" target before you get to the dh_install invocation.\n\nA: I wanted to specify that if the file to install is a folder, you can also rename it by using a pattern. This may not be self explanatory, so I thought it would be a good idea to have an example.\nSay you have a configuration folder named source and you want to install it on target machines as destination. Your .install file would look like this:\npath/to/source/*       path/to/destination/\n\nThis is rather simple, but you may not think about using the pattern when installing a whole folder.\n", "Q: VirtualBox looses gtk theme after system update Everyone once in a while when I do a system update, VirtualBox looses its GTK theme. I think it's when the kernel updates. I usually end up uninstalling and reinstalling the VirtualBox packages to fix it. Why does this happen, and is there a light weight fix?\n\nEdit: Adding a new screenshot showing other GTK apps.\n\n\nA: No idea why it happens (had the same issue crop up before) but a quick fix is to run qtconfig, under appearance tab there's 'select gui style' option - make sure it says GTK+. From top menu select File -> Save.\n\nA: What version of VirtualBox are u running? I use 3.2 OSE here, and never had any problemns with GTK theme (i use a customized one, so i would have noticed).\nBy the way... if youre using VirtualBox to host a Windows XP guest, why not installl the guest package? Its an ISO you can download and install inside the Windows XP guest. VirtualBox itself offers to install it for you. It would allow you to run MUCH better, have more features, including seamless mode. And in seamless the GTK theme would be irrelevant...\nEDIT\nThats weird. I use exatcly the same version and build as you (3.2.8_OSE r64453), and Im also running XP. I use a customized GTK Theme (from Linux Mint 10), and have updated kernel like 5 times in the last 6 months. Check: \n. \nQuestion: does it only happen in VirtualBox?

If I am typing in any sort of input (for example the terminal or a text field in Firefox or a text editor), I can type a few letters and then the entire OS will freeze for about half a second and I will lose focus. I can then (if I'm quick) click back into the input and continuing typing before it freezes again.\nThis will continue until I try and do something like close Firefox, kill/start a process from the terminal or save my work from a text editor. At that point the entire system locks up and I have to force the virtual machine to close.\nI only experience this if Ubuntu has been running for some time with a minimum of roughly 1 hour. I am running Ubuntu as a guest on Virtual box (version 4.0.4) from inside a Windows 7 host.

This is even more the case when the cause of this could be anywhere\n\n\n*\n\n*a problem of the host OS (Windows 7),\n\n*the guest OS (Ubuntu 10.10),\n\n*or from Virtual Box.\n\n\n\nFrom your descriptions we can only guess what might be the cause. In your case the system slows down before freezing, indicating problems in memory management, or from applications that eat up the CPU power you gave your virtual environment.\nIn the Ubuntu guest you can find out if an application causes this by running top in a terminal (or if you prefer a GUI in System -> Administration -> System Monitor -> Processes) to list CPU and memory usage of individual processes.\nOther valuable informations on problems, or error messages from applications can also be found in the .log files that can be viewed with System -> Administration -> Log File Viewer.\nIf you had suspicious findings there don't hesitate and edit your question to include these informations.\n\nSometimes it can help to increase the performance and stability of the guest OS with different settings (most can be done in the Virtual Box Manager GUI after a shut down of the guest OS):\n\n\n*\n\n*disable screensaver in the guest OS\n\n*enable VT-x/AMD-V (if your host system  can do this)\n\n*regularly update Virtual Box to current stable version\n\n*install Guest Additions\n\n*disable 3D acceleration\n\n*increase video memory\n\n*allow more RAM\n\n*but avoid to allow more than 50% of total system RAM\n\n*use one CPU core only\n\n*enable or disable Nested Paging\n\n*try using another audio driver (or disable audio)\n\n\nSettings in bold are recommended in any case.

Quite a basic question: I've noticed that to show the launcher when it's hidden that I have to move the mouse to the top left of the screen, rather than simply move the mouse to the left edge of the screen.  Is this a bug or is it like this by design?  If so, is there a way to make it show when the mouse is at the edge?\nSecondly, is it possible to prevent the launcher from only coming half into view if the mouse is moved slowly over the menu button?  Sometimes I want to show the launcher but I've moved the mouse too slowly (usually because the pointer was already in the vicinity).\n\nA: Recently the behavior has been changed so that pushing your mouse towards the left edge of the screen reveals the launcher.\nPressing and holding the Super key (Windows logo) will also reveal the launcher. Also (while you're at it) you can press Super plus any number to activate the corresponding launcher (i.e. launch the application)\n\n\n*\n\n*What are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts?\n\nA: Yes it's by design that you move to the top corner rather than just the side.\nAs for your second question, I find that very frustrating. It's not just about the speed, what you need to do is to push the mouse into the very corner of the screen. As far as it can go, not just over the button. I reported a bug about this, though it won't be fixed before 11.04's release.\nAs an alternative, to avoid both your problems, if you have a largish screen, you could set the launcher to never hide.\n\nA: The trick is to make a semi-loop around the logo - move it into the corner and then move it down. Then the launcher comes up okay.\nI personally found this behavior very easy to work with once I got it, and the launcher doens't open when I don't want it to either.\n", "Q: If I encrypt my home folder during installation, can I do another clean installation over the entire hard drive? \n*\n\n*Let's say I install Ubuntu 10.10 with an encrypted folder or hard drive, and I plan on doing a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04. Will the encryption cause an issue? Or will it still be as simple as popping in the cd and clicking button?\n\n*Does encryption cause noticeable performance issues?\n\n*Would I be able to copy some files onto an external hard drive if they are encrypted? Or will I have to decrypt them before copying?\n\nA: *\n\n*Encryption won't interfere with your next installation at all.\n\n*I've used full disk and home folder encryption for several years now, but I've never noticed any difference in performance. The most significant bottleneck in retrieving encrypted data involves getting the bits off of your disk. By comparison, decryption is so fast it's almost always unnoticeable.\n\n*After logging in (or entering your password) you can backup or copy files from your encrypted drive/folder exactly as you normally would, without any extra considerations.\nFull-disk and home folder encryption are transparent in most cases.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can either use the ecnrypted\nhard drive and install into it, or\nyou could wipe the entire drive and\ninstall unencrypted. Both work fine.\n\n*For very disk I/O intensive stuff,\nyou may be able to notice issues.\n\n*The general way this is done* is\nthat when you grab them from the\nencrypted drive they are decrypted\non the fly (I'm thinking TrueCrypt\netc) so when you save them they will\nbe unencrypted.\n\n\n*some encryption tools are more strict and won't let this happen.

So can someone give me (or link to) a good description of what a lens is?\n\nA: If you hover over the \"lenses\" tag below your question, you'll see this succinct description:\n\nLenses are elements of the Unity Dash that provide a UI to search both the web and application data.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Lenses\n\n*What lenses for Unity are available?\n\n*http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/five-neat-unity-lenses-in-development/\nIt is a graphical interface for a task, it is also linked in with the dash for search results. for example when clicking the application lens it shows the apps in a nice, slick interface , with other results for like app to download and most frequent apps.\n\n", "Q: Unity File Lens Giving Useless or No Results I just installed Natty fresh on my laptop, and for the purposes of this experiment, I have one file on my system. My Downloads, Documents, Music, etc are all empty, but Pictures contains one file named \"tornado.png\". If I simply hit the super key and search through that main lens, I don't get results for \"to\", \"torn\", or even \"tornado\" -- only for \"tornado.png\". And, if I search using the Files Lens (Super+S), I get no results at all, even for \"tornado.png\".\nIs this not getting indexed properly? What's going on?\n\nA: The file lens displays results based on files that you have actually opened. It does NOT search a full index of all your files.\nAt a technical level the results come from a tool called Zeitgeist rather than Tracker.\nIf you search for files useing Super +F you have the added advantage of having search results arranged by how recently you opened the files.\n\nA: I had the same problem when switching to Unity, and thought that not having proper indexing in 2011 is a bit weird. So I made a little data provider for the file lens which queries Tracker to ge the results.\nIt's available here: https://github.com/hoheinzollern/tracker\nAnd the instructions to get the thing running on your system are in the wiki: https://github.com/hoheinzollern/tracker/wiki\nLet me know if it works for you!\n\nA: I had the same problem with an empty dash.

LANG, for one thing, was pt_BR.UTF-8, so if that first field is supposed to be the default locale/charset, it was at odds with was LANG set.\nSo, what's the exact meaning and format of LANGUAGE?\n\nA: LANGUAGE determines the order of preference for user interface message localization with gettext. http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#The-LANGUAGE-variable\n\nA: LANGUAGE serves a similar purpose to LANG and LC_MESSAGES in that it controls what language the user interface is displayed in.\nThe main difference between them is that while LANG and LC_MESSAGES can only take a single locale specifier, LANGUAGE can take a list of colon separated list of locale specifiers.\nAs an example, this would allow a user to have programs display in Catalan if available and fall back to Spanish if not before finally falling back to untranslated English, which is not possible with the other variables. In this case would be LANGUAGE=\"ca:es:en\" (ISO 639-1 codes).\nThe other environment variables are set for the benefit of applications not using gettext for translation that only support the older environment variables.\nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*LANGUAGE variable at GNU\n\n*Environment variables at Ubuntu documentation\n", "Q: Will changing password re-encrypt my home directory? I need to change my user password. Do I need to take any extra steps for my encrypted home directory to become inaccessible with my old password and only accessible with my new password?\n\nA: There is no need to re-encrypt your home directory, and no further steps need to be taken.\nYour home directory is not directly encrypted with your password.  Instead, the passphrase used to encrypt the home directory is itself encrypted with your password.\nWhen you change your password, the home directory passphrase is re-encrypted with your new password, so you should have continued access to your files with the new password.\nThis is handled via PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), so should work with any password change tool.  The exception is administrative password changes where the original password is not provided.  This is expected behaviour though: if the administrator could decrypt your files without knowing your password then there would be no actual protection.\nIn the case you perform an administrative password change, after mounting your home directory with\necryptfs-mount-private\n\nand your old password, issue\necryptfs-rewrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n\nto change the unwrapping password to match your new one.

They are not even in alphabetical order but I can't see Chrome in there.\n\n*Ubuntu Software Centre under Get Software/Google/google-chrome-unstable/More Info says \"Version: 12.0.725-r80304\" which would be the latest, but running Crhome, the \"About Google Chrome\" dialog tells me it is \"11.0.686.1 dev\"\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? By the way is \"unstable\" a synonym for \"dev\" in Google Chrome. Ubuntu Software Centre only lists \"beta\", \"stable\", and \"unstable\" but not \"dev\".\n\nA: Google Chrome in updated in Ubuntu via normal system update.\nThe Unstable channel is actually the DEV Channel of Google Chrome.\nGo to System -> Administration -> Update Manager and update your system and the Google Chrome would be updated to latest DEV release.\nOr to selectively upgrade Google Chrome, run this command from the terminal:\nsudo apt-get upgrade google-chrome-unstable\n\n\nA: In an attempt to make this out-of date question useful, Currently Chrome supports a number of different release channels. For Ubuntu Linux as of the date of writing these are:\nStable Channel:  This channel has gotten the full testing and blessing of the Chrome test team, and is the best bet to avoid crashes and other issues.  It's updated roughly every two-three weeks for minor releases, and every 6 weeks for major releases.\nBeta Channel: If you are interested in seeing what's next, with minimal risk, Beta channel is the place to be.  It's updated every week roughly, with major updates coming every six weeks, more than a month before the Stable channel will get them.\nDev Channel: Want to see what's happening quickly, then you want the Dev channel.  The Dev channel gets updated once or twice weekly, and it shows what we're working on right now.  There's no lag between major versions, whatever code we've got, you will get.  While this build does get tested, it is still subject to bugs, as we want people to see what's new as soon as possible.\nSource:\nChrome Release Channels\n\nA: For me what worked is:\nsudo apt-get upgrade google-chrome-stable\n\n(instead of unstable)\n\nA: I was also facing a similar problem and wanted to upgrade Chrome from Version 65.0.3325.162 to the latest stable version.\nThe command:  \nsudo apt-get upgrade google-chrome-stable  \n\nupgrades all the packages installed in the system including Chrome.\nIf you only want to upgrade your Chrome version to the latest stable, you should run the following command:  \nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable  \n\nThis will install the latest stable version of Chrome if you do not have it installed. Otherwise, if you already have an older version installed in your system, it will automatically upgrade Chrome to the latest version. This way you can surely save on data.\n\nA: sudo apt-get -f upgrade google-chrome-stable\n\nTry this one out.

Is it possible to make ordinary keys sticky so that no release event is generated?\n\nA: If I understand you right, what you want is to uncheck the option \"Key presses repeat when key is held down\" at Menu > System > Preferences > Keyboard.  \n\n\nA: The first thing you need to do is identify the 'keycode' or 'keysym' of the key you would like to replace and the key you would like to replace it with.\nLet's do an example of replacing the 'F12' key with 'Left Super'.\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and run this command:\n\nxev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf \"%-3s %s\\n\", $5, $8 }'\nThis will run xev which captures keypresses, strips out irrelevant information and gives you, via the terminal output, both the 'keycode' and 'keysym' of the key which you press. Press each of the keys you want to replace and the one you want to replace it with.\nWhen I press F12 on my keyboard, I get this output:\n96  F12\nAnd when I press Left Super on my keyboard, I get this output:\n133 Super_L\nYou will need to write these down somewhere or remember them to use later.\n\n\n*Open up a text editor and enter this text (my example of replacing F12 with Left Super):\n\nkeycode 96 = Super_L\nor\nkeysym F12 = Super_L\nIn my testing, either option should work.\n\n\n*Save this file in your home directory as .Xmodmap\n(note the capitalised \"X\")\n\n\n*To test it out, in terminal again enter this command from your home directory:\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\nIf everything went to plan, your F12 key should now work as your Left Super.\nEach time you make a change to your .Xmodmap file you can run the above command again to apply changes.\nYou shouldn't need to run this command each time you login, as it should be read and applied each time you login.\nIf however this doesn't work, then of course you could place this command into a startup script.\nThere are a few caveats to mention:\na) Some keyboards will have a key labelled \"Fn\" or similar to access secondary functions on keys, like multimedia controls. From what I've read, you cannot remap this particular \"Fn\" key itself, though you should be able to remap the individual multimedia keys that pressing \"Fn+key\" provides.\nb) If you unplug and re-plug back in your keyboard, you will need to reload the .Xmodmap configuration with the same command give in step 4 above.\nc) If for some reason you want to comment out (ignore) a line in the .Xmodmap file, you need to put a \"!\" at the front of the line (instead of a \"#\" as in some other configuration files).\n", "Q: How do I build openssh from source?

Reading Canonical Design's post 4 months ago made me really intrigued using 11.04.. yet, we're already in Beta 1, feature freeze and all, and no fonts.\nIs this still due to be implemented in this version? \n\nA: The only expansions of the fonts have been ready to go in for the Ubuntu 11.04 release are Light (+Italic) and Medium (+Italic).  It is unlikely that any of the other expansions will make the release.  Remember that Ubuntu the operation system uses time-based releases, but Ubuntu the font family uses quality-based releases.  Yet like (in theory) all of the other components in Ubuntu, it is about taking the best that is available at the time of the freeze and polishing that.\nProportional Light and Medium (four fonts) work fine on MS Windows, Mac OS X and via Google Webfonts we have an issue that somewhere, probably in FontConfig/Qt is not parsing the weight of Medium correctly on Ubuntu.  Medium is between is between Regular and Bold, and Light is lighter than all of the rest.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Medium - Bug #744812 \"FontConfig/Qt stack choke on Ubuntu Medium font meta-data (No medium in Inkscape and too bold in Qt apps)\"\nThe Ubuntu Monospace consists of a further four fonts.

These are at the engineering stage, the beauty of Arabic means that it needs to flow from one letter to the next using various OpenType features and this has required more effort.  On the Hebrew side the reception of the design has not been as clear-cut as for the Arabic, so Hebrew may end up taking longer.  A Hebrew sans-serif font is very hard to get right, and there's no point releasing it until it's clear that it's definitely better than the other libre fonts out there covering Hebrew.  Both Hebrew and Arabic represent vowels sounds/cantillation marks as diacriticals placed around the characters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arabic - Engineering stage, still needs hinting\n\n*Hebrew - Make take longer to finalise the design, before hinting\n\n\nAlthough the Semitic fonts were originally scheduled/hoped to come out at the same time, it's possible that the Arabic additions may be earlier if they end up being ready first.\nFeedback\nOne of the hardest part is knowing who can provide feedback on a given script/language.  One of the most useful things you could do is assemble a contact list of people who have the skills to test the fonts and are definitely willing to give feedback (positive or negative) after doing so to improve the final result.  \nIt would be useful up to the mailing list or beta team so that it's easy to keep in contact and know when new parts are available, or proceeding through the phased testing process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Font Family mailing list\n\n*Ubuntu Font Family Interest Group (beta test team)\n\n\nAnything else\nHope that helps.

I followed the instructions here to remove Pulse Audio, and seems to have worked fine since.\n\nA: Skype has been labelling Beta in its Linux version. Well I don't know if it cares about us linux users coz its been beta since I don't know when. Yet it is a nice app. May be you should try completely removing the software and installing the one from cannonical partner repository or if you have done that may be try the one from skype site itself.\n\nA: If you're running under Ubuntu 64-bits, have a look here: https://jira.skype.com/browse/SCL-670?focusedCommentId=47773&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_47773\n\nA: The suggestion at the link seems to solve me the problem too:\ncd /usr/lib32\nsudo chmod a-r libpulse.so.0.12.3 libpulse-simple.so.0.0.3 libpulsecommon-0.9.22.so\n\n\nA: The problem is with no doubt related with Skype when playing .wav files through pulseaudio. This issue happens mostly when chatting  rather than when having an audio/video conference because Skype is configured by default to play a sound every time a message is sent/received. Since this is the most frequent event of playing .wav files, there may be at least two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace pulseaudio with ALSA (which may be controversial for a certain part of the linux community), or\n\n*Simply configure Skype to not play any sound when receiving/sending messages within a conversation.\n\n\nA: In ubuntu 12.04 LTS/32bit where I had the very same problem after some updates, I have now just libpulsecore-2.0.so and /usr/lib folder so the correct code to fix access rights would be \n/usr/lib$ sudo chmod a-r libpulsecore-2.0.so\n\nwith this \"fix\" Skype no longer fails. \nProbably until libpulsecore gets updated... damn M$kype.\n\nA: Can you try running Skype from the command line ie\nsudo skype \n\nhere you may see if any error messages come up. I also got around some sound issues a while ago by installing pavucontrol \nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\nbut since Ubuntu 11.04 was installed the sound control menu has been improved. Anyway  in 10.10 pavucontrol enabled me to sort my input/mic source correctly via pulseaudio by selecting the input source. In 10.10 this action helped me have a working skype in Ubuntu\nHope that may help you . Let us know what error messages if any you get.\nps I also always deselect the allow skype to adjust my audio controls as I show below in the options section as I find skype will quite happily mess up my sound!\n(BTW depending on which version of Skype you are running you may not see the message about pulseaudio below)\n\n", "Q: How do I remap the Caps Lock and Ctrl keys? I'd like to remap my keys such that Ctrl behaves as the Caps Lock key and vice-versa. Also, if possible I'd like the settings to be available only within the currently logged-in user. How can I achieve this?\nI'm a vim user, unlike the other people who use this machine, so I'd like those settings only for my account.\n\nA: Here's a way to do it without installing extra software:\nsetxkbmap -layout us -option ctrl:swapcaps\n\nSource:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.noah.org/wiki/CapsLock_Remap_Howto\n\nA: One of the best ways to do that graphically if you are using the GNOME shell is to install Gnome Tweak Tool:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\nFor version 3.30.0 and later:\n\n*\n\n*Open tweak-tool and click on the Keyboard & Mouse section in the left menu bar.\n\n*Click on the Additional Layout Options button on the left.\n\n*Under Caps Lock behavior select Caps Lock is also a Ctrl.\n\nFor older versions:\n\n*\n\n*Open tweak-tool and click on the typing section in the left column.\n\n*You should now see the line Caps Lock key behavior on the left.\n\n*Choose Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl key instead of Disabled in the drop-down list and you should be good.\n\nEnjoy your new Ctrl key!\n\nA: Open the following for editing:\nsudo vi /etc/default/keyboard\n\nAnd edit XKBOPTIONS=\"ctrl:swapcaps\"\nThen, reconfigure:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nor \n/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option \"ctrl:swapcaps\"\n\n\nA: The accepted answer is confusing because gnome-tweak-tools doesn't show any \"typing\" section.\nInstead, click on \"Keyboard & Mouse\" section and then choose \"Additional Layout Option\". There, you will see \"Caps Lock behavior\" which allows converting caps lock to different keys.\n\n\nA: This is an easy task once you know how to do it.  \n1) Check the keycode of yours key. Run this program at terminal.  \nxev\n\nAt this example, the terminal shows that the keycode for my k is \"45\".\n2) Change them as you like creating this file:\ngedit ~/.Xmodmap\nIt's contents should look like this example: \nkeycode  37 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock\nkeycode  66 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L\n(Change the keycode number as needed - look at step \"1\")  \nIlustration:\n\n(Obs.: if I want to change my k I should use \"keycode 45\" as showed at step \"1\"). \n4) Logout and log back in or reboot or run this:  \nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\nHope you enjoy ;-)\n\nA: On KDE-based distributions (like KDE Neon or Kubuntu) this behavior can be configured in the regular system settings. Open the system settings, select \"Input Devices\" => \"Keyboard\" => \"Advanced\". In the category \"Ctrl key position\" select \"Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock\".\n\n\nA: To permanently change the behaviour: \n\n\n*\n\n*run dconf-editor\n\n*select org.gnome.desktop.input-sources\n\n*Change xkb-options to ['ctrl:nocaps'] (or add it to any existing options)\nor on the command line (Warning -- this overwrites your existing settings!):\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['ctrl:nocaps']\"\n\n\nA: 13.10+:\nInstall and use gnome-tweak-tool > Keyboard & Mouse > Keyboard > Additional Layout Options > Caps Lock behavior.\nPre 13.10:\nOpen the Keyboard Preferences dialog (System -> Preferences -> Keyboard).  On the layout tab, click the Options... button.  Expand the Ctrl key position section and select Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock.\nThose settings should be applied each time you log in, and will only affect your user account.\n\nA: This is how to do it manually (without additional tools), via XKB, which is the default keys manager for recent Ubuntus.\nModify /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc , section xkb_symbols \"pc105\":\n//key <CAPS> {  [ Caps_Lock     ]   };\n//key <LCTL> {  [ Control_L     ]   };\nkey <CAPS> {    [ Control_L ]   };\nkey <LCTL> {    [ Caps_Lock     ]   };\n\nLogin/logout or reboot.

If I run that same job through cron the output is mailed to /var/mail/username. Where is anacron mailing the output?\n\nA: Most likely anacron is executing the jobs as root, so the mail isn't being sent to your user.

It takes plenty of effort for the cpu to redraw the screen. That being said, the smooth-scrolling option and extensions in Firefox make the scrolling somewhat erratic, compared to Chromium and Opera. Simply scrolling up and down (with a smooth-scrolling extension) causes cpu usage to spike for Firefox but not for Xorg. For me with Chromium however, Xorg spikes more. I have a an old ARM11 smartphone without a graphics chip and I get better scrolling on that then on my desktop. A smartphone with a graphics chip can get 60fps while scrolling a webpage. Chromium 14 is supposed to have proper smooth scrolling baked in, utilizing the graphics chip.

How quickly the data can transfer on and off your USB. Becos the data transfer rate over a USB 2.0 is limited, you see. So, in that context, a liveCD version has several advantages over a full install on a USB.\nFirstly, a liveCD stores its data in compressed loop files, typically using squashfs. And becos the data is compressed, it can be transferred off the USB more quickly. Whereas with a full install, the data is uncompressed.\nSecondly, benchmarks for data transfer off a USB show that large files transfer much faster than a lot of small files. With the LiveCD format, the data is stored in one or more large cloop files, which is ideal. But with the full install version, there are many smaller files. And that can result in a slower data transfer rate.\nThirdly, a liveCD linux uses a union filesystem like AUFS. It is a virtual file system, sometimes known as a stackable filesystem. It is designed such that write cycles to the USB are minimized, certainly much less that for the full install version on a USB. This helps becos a) data writes to a USB take x2 longer than reads, and b) excessive writing to your usb will wear it out sooner.\n\nA: As Roland said, the speed improvement you got is likely to be the difference between a disk (relatively high latency, seek times etc) and solid state memory.\nInstalling a LiveCD version on your internal drive will work, but should not be thought of as a speed improvement. It may be slightly slower, as there are some workarounds involved with using a read-only filesystem.\nActually, some bits may work faster as they will be running from a ramdisk.\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bigger USB stick with a LiveCD, so you can fit the whole thing on\n\n*Solid state drives in your machine - will be considerably faster than hard drives\nUPDATE:\nSubsequent to your updates, your question makes more sense now. It looks like what you mean is you want to take the existing install you have on your hard drive and convert it to a LiveCD for your USB stick. If that is the case, go to this Ubuntuforums post which describes the process. The differences are (from the Ubuntuforums post):\n\n\n*\n\n*The CD or DVD is read only media. Linux needs to have write access to certain parts of the system to be able to operate properly (like \"/dev\" \"/proc\" \"/var\" \"/tmp\"). There are a lot of approaches to address this problem. All of which utilize the system RAM. \n\n*With the harddrive installation the location of the root filesystem is fixed. So it is passed to the kernel at boot time using the root=/dev/... parameter. With a live CD/DVD, the location of the root device is not fixed as the user might have multiple cdrom drives, these drives can be ide, scsi ... etc. \n\n*To fit on a CD, the filesystem is usually compressed using squashfs. So we need to autodetect the filesystem type. We also need to have the proper modules for mounting it.\n", "Q: Network Manager download Where I can download the Network Manager for Meerkat?

I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 and have been trying to figure out if it has three monitor support.\nI tried plugging in three monitors and the card does pick all three up. After I set them up, save the xorg.conf file and restart, only two of them come up active. I've tried looking around the web to see if maybe it only supports two.\nAnyone have more info?\n\nA: Nope you can only use two monitors per Nvidia card.\nEven in Windows you're limited to two per card. The only exception to this is the latest GTX590 which, technically speaking, is two cards in one.\n\nEdit: This seems like it might be changing in the newest Nvidia hardware (higher Kepler chipsets).

Replacing Python system-wide could make applications hugely unstable and in a lot of cases, they'll just break.\n\n\n*\n\n*Python-based libraries are installed to a version-specific place (eg /usr/lib/python2.6/) so swapping in a new version without catering for existing packages will break things that need things on the right Python path.\n\n*There are major language differences between 2.6 and 3.x that, if a package doesn't check to see what version it's using (common of older scripts) could make things unstable.\nFor example, if you divide two ints in 2.6 you are returned a floored int; but in 3.x it'll return a float.\nThe safest thing to do is just call the 3.x binary when you want to use Python 3.x.\npython3.1 my_python_script.py\n\n\nA: You could simply change the symlink:\nrm /usr/bin/python\nln -s /usr/bin/python3.1 /usr/bin/python\n\n", "Q: problem with chmod command I don't know what is happening\nexperimentx@workmateX:/var/www$ sudo chmod 0777 -r /var/www/\n\nchmod: cannot access `0777': No such file or directory\n\nexperimentx@workmateX:/var/www$ \n\n\nA: Use \"-R\" instead of \"-r\".\nFrom the chmod help:\n\n-R, --recursive         change files and directories recursively\n\n\nA: Also note that the 0 will no longer clear suid/sgid/sticky in recent versions of chmod and you'll soon have to use a symbolic mode (if that's what you're intending to do).\n\n\n*\n\n*coreutils bug#8391: chmod setuid & setguid bits\n\n*Red Hat Bug 691466 - [RFE] Enable octal-digit mode for removal of UID/GID/sticky bits\n\nA: Use this:\nsudo chmod 0777 -R /var/www/\n\n-R instead of -r.\n\nA: Perhaps going or directing the file in terminal and once you locate file by:\nls\n\nthen run the command:\nchmod +x filename\n\nfrom that location I'm sure it will work.\n", "Q: Can I get TV-out through VGA? I have a VGA to RCA cable and an Intel Graphic Media Accelerator video card, but I'm not sure if my graphics card has TV-Out function capability through the VGA and if Ubuntu supports this. My laptop is Acer Aspire 5740 with Core i3.\n\nA: Typically, these VGA to RCA cables fit to a specific graphics card several generations back. It worked by re-assigning specific pins on the VGA plug to put out composite signal (often called \"TV-Mode\" or similar in the driver software).\nyou didn't get it with your laptop, did you? today's graphics cards can't do this anymore, and this cable won't fit your card.\nIf you want RCA/composite video out of your laptop, you need a so-called scan converter. Prices range from about 30€ to several hundred €, quality varies from cheap china knock-off without adjustable parameters to broadcast quality equipment.\nI use a model similar to this. It's a reasonable compromise (for me) between price and quality.\n", "Q: Is Rhythmbox in active development?

I was playing Gnu FreeDink and when I exited out it just sort of crashed and stayed fullscreen with the music playing. I couldn't for the life of me get back to the desktop, alt-tab did nothing, same with ctrl-alt-delete, esc, etc.\nI've had this happen with fullscreen games, and I usually wind up have to hard-reset to get back. Pretty frustrating.\nI googled around and found xkill, but that wont launch on a fullscreen app. I tried ctrl-alt-F2 which puts me to terminal, I can run top but it wouldn't kill freedink and it wouldn't let me start the x server again. I really didn't know what I was doing.\nAt least in windows 7 you can usually get to the task manager and kill the program, but I haven't found anything like Ubuntu to get me back.\nAnything I can do?\n\nA: If Control+Alt+F1 works you can use it to drop to a hard terminal. From there you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try killing the application. I use htop to find and nuke something (sudo apt-get install htop) but you can also just use commands like kill and pkill if you're happy with them. I prefer htop because it lets me see what is schizing out.\nIt's then Control+Alt+F7 (sometimes F8 or F9) to return to your X session.\n\n*If that doesn't work (X is still locked up) or the X server is somehow damaged (tons of artefacts, wrong resolution, etc), and I don't have any unsaved work, I'd try restarting gdm (the beast that launches X and manages logins etc).\nsudo restart gdm\n\nThat should automatically pull you back into X but all your applications die with X so that's why I say this is really for when you've got nothing open that you should have saved.\nIf you can't get to a TTY, or SSH in from another system (if you're running a SSH server and have another computer or phone with SSH client) and can't do the above, you might have to try the magic restart keyboard combination. It's somewhat safer than pulling the plug.\nHold Alt + PrintScr/SysRq and then slowly type: r e i s u b\nA handy mnemonic for remembering this is: Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken\nIf that doesn't work, go postal on the power button.\n\nA: You could try to restart X server by pressing CTRL-ALT-Backspace.\nJust make sure that you have enabled the keyboard shortcut from:\nSystem --> Preferences --> Keyboard --> \"Layouts\" Tab --> Options\n\n\n\n\nA: You can press ctrlaltF1 to drop to a console. Log in there, and you can kill the offending program. I like to use htop for this.\nThat said, it's possible that X itself might be wedged. In that case, you'll have to restart GDM:\n sudo service gdm restart\n\nTo return to X, press ctrlaltF7.\n", "Q: How to increase disk space? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I free up disk space? \n\nI am running out of space on my notebook, so I thought I would delete some unused stuff.\nI was thinking about:\n\n\n*\n\n*cleaning the home folder as explained in: Cleaning up my Home Directory\n\n*removing old logs from /var/log\n\n*removing apt cache\n\n\nAny other ideas? \n\nA: A sudo apt-get clean will remove cached .debs that are sitting on disk from updates.\n\nA: I usually remove \n\n\n*\n\n*apps I don't use\n\n*usused fonts, themes and icons\n\n\nA: You could also identify files that you don't often use and compress them.

I'd suggest something like Synaptic for this and you want to search the Installed section for linux-image and linux-headers.\nThe linux-image and linux-headers for each kernel version combines to about 200MB of disk space.

Is there any way by which I can disable the textbox?\nCase study: say I have to locate a directory called \"xyz\". I type \"xyz\", and the browser will guide me to xyz directory, but I realise I also have to check in directory \"abc\", then I have to press escape, or backspace delete and search again for \"abc\". In Kubuntu, I simply have to type \"abc\" after a gap of say a second. That is very handy. I believe this can be achieved without a search box. Please tell me how.\n\nA: The timeout does exists. By default 5 seconds after you type anything, the search box will vanish.\nUnfortunately, as with too many Gnome variables, this timeout is hard-coded into Nautilus so there's no easy way to fix this. The only way I know of is downloading the source, editing it and recompiling Nautilus.\nThose instructions aren't hard to follow and should work.\n\nA: To default Breadcrumbs view in Nautilus open gconf-editor, go to apps -> nautilus -> preferences and untick always_use_location_entry:\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome initial links typed into address bar lost into the ether? When I first open chrome, the first couple of links I type into the address bar completely disappear after pressing enter and the pages aren't loaded.\nRunning Ubuntu 10.10, is there any known fix for this problem?\n\nA: Chrome just hasn't finished loading. Another thing is that you might be running a older version - you should be updating every few weeks. \nYou can also report this as a bug here at the Chromium project (The open source version of Google Chrome). \n", "Q: Is it possible to create users that can only use one directory? Now I've bought an Ubuntu Cloud server. I installed Webmin this morning, and now I have a question. \nIs it possible to create users that can only use one directory, SVN, FTP, PHP, Python, MySQL, Apache? So for example, user Kevin only may use /var/www/kevin/? And he may view everything in /var/www/ but not execute/write and all other stuff is forbidden to view/execute/write.\n\nA: In your situation, you've the owner of the folder and its directories, say apache. Kevin is the user which is allowed to read the contents, but not write or execute it. All others are denied read, write and execute permissions.\nThis fits perfectly in the Linux filesystem permissions system.\npermission  bits\n  Read       4\n  Write      2\n eXecute     1\n\nEach file or directory can be given permissions based on the owner, group or everyone else.\n\n\n*\n\n*The owner (apache) can do anything, so let's give it read and write permissions (4 + 2 = 6)\n\n*To prepare for the future, in case you need to give someone other Kevin read permissions to the file, create a new group, say apache-users. Then, add Kevin to this group and set the group permission bits to 4 (Read)\n\n*Next, deny anyone who do not own the file or is not a member of the apache-users group all permissions, 0.\n\n\nTo add the group apache-users and add Kevin as a member, go to System -> Users and Groups. Open the tab Local Groups and press Create a new group. Enter the group name (apache-users) at Group name. Select Kevin at Members and press ->. Confirm these changes by pressing Create.\nFor a file, you would run the next commands to change the owner, group and permissions:\nsudo chown apache filename\nsudo chgrp apache-users filename\nsudo chmod 640 filename\n\nDirectories\nThe permissions for directories are almost the same, except for the execute bit (1). The execute bit configures whether an user is allowed to descend in the directory, i.e. access other files and directories inside a directory. The read bit controls whether you can list the contents of a directory (ls).\nSo if a folder /dir is owned by root:root (group root), and the permissions of /dir/file is set to 777, you cannot access (read, write or execute) /dir/file if the permissions of /dir is set to 666 or 770 (note the missing eXecute permission).\nThe permissions for a folder would become 750: read, write and execute (7) for the owner (apache), read and execute (5) for the group (apache-users) and no permissions (0) for anyone else.\nFor your setup, the permissions become (* = depends):\nlocation             owner     group        permissions\n/                    root      root         755\n/var/                root      root         755\n/var/www/            root      root         755\n/var/www/kevin/      kevin     *            700 or 750\n/var/www/apache/     apache    apache-users 750\n/var/www/other/      *         *            700 or 750\n/var/www/anyoneread/ *         *            755\n\n/var/www/other/ is the directory of some other user which do not allow you (kevin) to dive in the directory.\n", "Q: Extremely slow bootup I've been upgrading Ubuntu since 8.04. I never did a clean installation after that. Recently my laptop is booting up extremely slow. It takes more than 150 seconds to boot up. How can i make it faster? I'm attaching the boot chart. Is there anything unusual which is slowing down the boot up?\n\nA: Thats one mean and big boot chart. There are also several process that are taking WAYYY too long to finish. My guess would be that there are still several things that got mixed up between upgrades. Did you check your Startup Applications:\nSystem -> Preferences -> Startup Applications (UnCheck the ones you are sure not to use)\nAfter that check for installed programs that you REALLY do not need.\nBut seeing as your tag says 11.04 am guessing you are using Ubuntu 11.04. Because this version is not yet finished or even RC you WILL have a big change to find problems when loading, using it, playing with it, etc... I do not recommend an Ubuntu version until it is ready. This is because of things that still need more work on, missing fixes, etc..\n\nA: I suspect the ACPI. If you do not explicitly need it. You could shut it off from the Grub-menu or in the BIOS.\nThe Grub way: You will need go into edit mode by pressing E from the Grub menu boot selections. At the row that say quiet splash add acpi=off in the end of it. Then press Ctrl+X to boot. This is not a permanent solution. Try it first and if it work you could do it permanent later.\n", "Q: How to install older version on PostgreSQL and PHP5? Because of differencies in package versions between my development machine and my provider's server, I have to downgrade packages installed on my computer.\nIn Ubuntu 10.04 LTS default PostgreSQL version is 8.4, but I need 8.3. When I try to install postgresql-8.3 I get error:\n\nPackage postgresql-8.3 is not available, but is referred to by another package.\n  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\n  is only available from another source\n  E: Package postgresql-8.3 has no installation candidate\n\nSo, my first question is: How do I install PostgreSQL 8.3 in Ubuntu 10.04.\nAnd the second question: how do I install PHP 5.2.6, or at least 5.2 in Ubuntu 10.04 (where default version is 5.3.2)?\n\nA: Well, if you really want to keep your development and production environments in sync, you may want to consider just using a virtual machine of some kind. That way you can make it EXACTLY like production, without needing to screw up anything on your workstation.\nThat being said, though, you might try checkinstall. I've never used it, but the idea is to grab the sources of the version you want, configure and compile them as usual, and then use the program to make a DEB package to install.\nThere's also the idea of grabbing the source package from your server environment's version, and recompiling it on your machine with debuild -us -uc -b.\n\nA: If the old version of PostgreSQL is not available in Ubuntu repositories see PostgreSQL Apt Repository:\n\nThis repository will integrate with your normal systems and patch management, and provide automatic updates for all supported versions of PostgreSQL throughout the support lifetime of PostgreSQL.\n\nI don't know PHP.\n", "Q: How to remove nautilus and intstall nautilus elementary with coverflow?

What is Ubuntu's market share on non-servers?\n\nA: Since most users don't buy Ubuntu, it isn't traded, and if there is no trade, there is no market, hence no market-share. \nThis might look nitpicking, but of course you don't have sales figures, if you don't sell it, so how should you count it? How do you handle parallel installations, which are quite common? \nNobody counts the number of installations in a reliable way, So it is hard to estimate. \n\nA: For these kind of things I tend to turn to Statcounter Global Stats, more specifically this part. That doesn't go beyond the distros, but given Ubuntu's popularity compared to other distros I'll wager that it's not too far below the linux number. Of course that's only computers that are online, so the numbers are still skewed most likely.\n\nA: I don't think it's an unanswerable question. The Wikipedia article about it has a thoroughly-researched and up-to-date answer. That conclusion is just over 1%. What's intriguing here is Android, which is already at 3/4ths of whatever penetration \"Linux\" has been able to achieve in the past 15 or so years.\nAs far as breaking down the relative use between popular distros, I like to use Google trends. Ubuntu has been running away with it, and making a good case for Linux on the desktop, for years now, but it's clear from the trending that Android is about to make desktop Linux statistically irrelevant.\n\nA: No idea about just Ubuntu, but W3schools claims 5.1% for Linux since March 2011.\nW3Schools OS Statistics\n\nA: We don't know for sure. Microsoft says <1 % but I think its somewhere between 2% to 3%.\n", "Q: Move files with ssh I know that I can copy files from my computers with scp. Is there a way to move them at once instead of copying with ssh?\n\nA: One way would be to mount the SSH using sshfs. It's fairly quick, fairly clean and doesn't need root to action. There's a little bit of setup to do (that may actually be optional these days) but you can read about that on its help page.\nBut here's how I just mounted my media centre's home in a subdirectory of my local home:\noli@bert:~$ mkdir tim # create a directory to mount on\noli@bert:~$ sshfs oli@tim:/home/oli tim\noli@bert:~$ ls tim\nalsa-info.sh  kernelbuild  key  NVIDIA-Linux-x86-270.26.run  uberboxee\n\nOnce you're at that point, the remote filesystem and local filesystem act as one. You can move things into the mounted volume as you like. When you're done, just fire off fusermount -u the_dir_you_mounted_on:\noli@bert:~$ fusermount -u tim\noli@bert:~$ ls tim\noli@bert:~$ # there's nothing there because there's nothing mounted on it\n\n\nA: Well SCP stands for Secure Copy (Not Secure Move ;). Joking) but for what i have read in the man pages, help sites and others there is no way to use scp to \"move\" a file. Just copy it.\nYou might try: scp FILE user@domain: && rm FILE\nI added the && since && will only run the next command IF the first one succeeds.\nSorry could not be more helpful with the specific scp problem. I use scp a lot too.\nIf you want, you could use rysnc which i find it sometimes better than scp.\nYou could rsync --remove-source-files FILE user@domain: which i even find it better if you loose connection to the server (big files for example) since rsync can continue with even the --partial and --progress flags\n", "Q: Disable notifications on track change? I've not long been running Banshee on 11.04, and my main problem with it is that when changing tracks a notification is displayed, this is all fine when using hardware buttons on my laptop to change track, but when using the sound menu the notifications overlap my sound menu. \nSo I'm just wondering if there is any way to disable notifications from showing, like there is in Rhythmbox?\nThanks,\n\nA: Found an almost perfect solution, with thanks to @macydanim to pointing me in the right direction.\nIn Natty, Banshee won't show up in the notification area, so I ran the following command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'banshee']\"\nThis adds Banshee to a \"whitelist\" of applications allowed to be shown in the notification area.\nLogged out, and logged back in again. Then in Banshee, went to Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions. Disabled Sound Menu Integration and enabled Notification Area Icon. Then, right clicked the notification icon and disabled show notifications.\nI then disabled Notification Area Icon extension, and tried re-enabling Sound Menu Integration. This, however, still showed notifications whenever the track was changed. I found out though, that you don't need the Sound Menu Integration plug in enabled for Banshee to work in the sound menu. So if I leave it disabled I don't get notified on track change, but can still operate Banshee from the sound menu. The only downside, is that I can't click the close button on Banshee and have it minimise to tray, so you just have to remember to press the minimise button now instead of the close one and keep Banshee open.\n\nA: After following Josh's instructions I tried just disabling the \"Sound Menu Integration\" extension (Preferences->Extensions menu) without taking any other action. \"Notification Area Icon\" is also disabled (by default). That alone seems to disable the notifications.\n\nA: Hey,\nthis is how it worked for me.\nMaybe its not the obvious way but it worked.\nIn Banshee go to Edit, Preferences,Extensions.\nIn the categorie Utilities there is a checkbox \nNotification Area Icon, check this. If you now move to the\nicon in the bar, right click it and uncheck Notifications. You can now also uncheck the box for the Notification Area Icon again, notifications won't pop up again.\n", "Q: How to repair apt-get command?

I just can't find how to get a workspace grid using Gnome 3. It just stays vertical, width of 1 and unlimited height...\nAny help would be really appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: The Frippery Bottom Panel exension sets a horizontal layout for workspaces. When it is active, you need to use ctrl+alt+left and ctrl+alt+right to switch workspaces, instead of ctrl+alt+up and ctrl+alt+down.\nAt the time of writing, however, it doesn't change the layout of the workspaces in the activity view, where the workspaces are still stacked vertically, and where you need to use the old ctrl+alt+up and ctrl+alt+down keys.\nAlso, it adds a bottom panel which you can't remove without disabling the whole extension. On this bottom panel, there are buttons to quickly access each workspace, but they don't show a miniature of the windows on that workspace, like we used to have in gnome 2.\nThe extension is only 1128 lines of rather straightforward javascript, so I might derive a quick and dirty \"horizontal workspace layout\" extension in a few days if I find some time.\n\nA: It's not possible to do this, it would be better for you to ask this of a GNOME developer via their mailing list, and if you know how to code in javascript you could possibly write an extension for it.\n\nA: I modified the Frippery Bottom Panel extension to only have horizontal workspace switching and removed all other functionality. it works for me, here is a link:\nModified Frippery Bottom Panel on GoogleDrive\nto install just put the directory into '~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions', then restart Gnome via Alt+F2 and enter 'r', or just logout and login again.\nin metadata.json i set listed shell versions are 3.6 to 3.18, latest works.\nright now this just puts the globally defined number of workspaces into a horizontal row. a grid (horizontal+vertical) would actually be possible as well, but you need to modify the script to change the dimensions.\n@Georges Duperon, unfortunately i cant comment yet.\nbtw. what is a good place to put shared dirty hacks, dont want to use github for it.. ?\n\nA: There are two extension to achieve the desired behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Workspace Grid Extension\n\n*Workspace Matrix\nThe former seems to be more popular (and still seems to receive updates) while the latter is more actively developed.\n\nA: Another option would be Workspaces to Dock extension.\nIn the extension configurations, simply set the position of the dock as top or bottom of the screen and check the box \"Use horizontal switching when the dock is positioned horizontally\".\n\nA: Another gnome-shell-extension can be found on \n\n\n*\n\n*https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2141/horizontal-workspaces/\nor on Gitlab\n\n\n*\n\n*https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell-extensions\n", "Q: Incomplete install and I cannot see part of the hard disk I had tried to install Ubuntu 10.10 near a Windows7 in a 64 system.

How would I go about writing a script to get the same list of installed software as reported by the Ubuntu Software Center?\nEvery reference I can find mentions either dpkg -l or rpm -qa (or some variant thereof), but these typically include every single last package and library and what-not, and you end up with a list of 1000+ entries.\nThe Ubuntu Software Center app however shows a much of concise (and human-friendly) list--currently 67 items on my Ubuntu box.  This is the sort of list I'm interested in.  Can anyone point me to a script that can obtain something similar?  Preferably something that can run on other distributions, but I'll take whatever I can get.\nThanks.\n\nA: In Python, you can get the list of installed packages this way:\nimport apt\npackages = apt.Cache()\npackages.open()\ninstalled_packages = [i.name for i in packages if i.is_installed]\n\nIf you want to know additional info about the packages, the process is a bit more involved. See the documentation for Python's apt module for all the information that's available. Additionally, you can look through the Software Center's source to find out what they do.\nYou won't get this info merely by looking at some file somewhere or running a simple command. You're going to need to do some scripting.\nEDIT: I believe that Software Center gets its list of packages to show from those packages that ship .desktop files. It might be more complicated than that, but you can easily filter the list to those packages that are installed and have a .desktop file. This example continues my previous code:\nimport os\ndesktop_files = ['.'.join(i.split('.')[:-1]) for i in os.listdir('/usr/share/applications')]\ninstalled_in_software_center = [i for i in installed_packages if i in desktop_files]\n\n\nA: May still not be what you're looking for...\ndpkg --get-selections\n\nIf not (I can't comment yet), run the following and let me know the number (just counts number of lines.\ndpkg --get-selections | wc -l\n\n\nA: You cat get the data from the logs in /var/log/apt. As the logs are rotated, most of them are compressed. First we combine the current log with the compressed ones, before we extract all the packages that was installed, but not automatically. This was just trial and error from my part, so it can probably be cleaned up a bit.  \ncd /var/log/apt   \nsudo -s\ncat history.log > allhistory\nzcat history.log*gz >> allhistory.log\ncat allhistory.log | grep Install | sed s/Install://g | tr ')' '\\n' | grep -v automatic | sed s/,//g | sed s/:.*$//g | sort -u | grep -v \"^$\"\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the Software Center filters based on the section the package is in.  While it won't be exactly the same as the filter that the Software Center uses, you can do something similar by filtering out library packages:\ndpkg --get-selections|grep -i -v \"deinstall\"|grep -v \"lib\"\n\nThe grep is to filter out the things that are either not installed or are generally hidden by the software center.   You can add more things to filter out as needed - the \"lib\" string is a good indicator that it's not an end-user application.\n\nA: Maybe APTonCD would help?\nIts a tool that scans your APT-installed packages and build a list for you. You can then manually select/deselect the ones you want, save the list, and it can even download/use cache to save selected packages in a CD/folder (for an offline automatic install of currently installed apps)\nIt also has some filters like include dependencies, include old versions, etc..\nAPTonCD comes default in Mint 10, but since they share same Ubuntu repositories, you can install it via software manager.\n\nA: What software center is likely showing (and what you mean by apps) is the .desktop files. Essentially they serve as shortcuts to actual binary files ( think in terms of Windows shortcuts and .exe files  ).\nMost (but not all ! ) apps installed through software manager have a shortcut in /usr/share/applications. The structure of that file is something like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=My App Name\nExec=/full/path/to/binary\nComment=this app does something\nIcon=/full/path/to/icon.png\n\nUnity's application scope parses these files files to extract description and name of the app. We can do something similar with this command:\n find /usr/share/applications/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \"*.desktop\" | xargs  awk -F '=' '/Desktop Entry/{seek=1}; {if(seek==1 && $0~/Name=/){$1=\"\";print;seek=0;next}}' \n\nBasically we generate list of all those .desktop files, parse them to extract a line with Name= but only display part of the line after = sign. \nAs I've mentioned some of the apps don't have .desktop file OR may be stored in /opt folder, so you may want to perform the same command (with -maxdepth 1 removed ) on the /opt directory as well.\n", "Q: Why do the default Applications in Ubuntu always change? \n*\n\n*In version 9.10 they replaced Pidgin with Empathy\n\n*In version 10.10 F-spot was replaced with Shotwell \n\n*In the next version Gnome will be replaced with Unity\n\n*Rhythmbox will be replaced by Banshee \n\n*OpenOffice will be replaced by LibreOffice.\n\n\nI know I can still choose to install any of these applications. \nBut I think these steps shrink the development communities and the support for each of these programs. It also causes general confusion since in each version something works completely differently.\nWhat I don't understand is, why are always young, less stable, and less mature programs being taken time after time, instead of putting effort into the current, well working programs?\n\nA: There are always specific reasons why applications are removed and new ones are added from the default installation media; these programs are of course still available via the Software Center.\n9.10\nPidgin was replaced by Empathy\nEmpathy is a GNOME Application and better integrates with the whole desktop environment. Before Empathy was developed like crazy Pidgin was the de-facto standard for most distros. Only when Empathy's development boosted, they replaced it. I don't see  any chances of it being replaced any soon.\n\n10.10\nF-spot was replaced by Shotwell\nF-Spot development was getting stagnant and there were hardly any active maintainers (IIRC). Right now there is only one major developer AFAIK - Ruben Vermeesh\nOn the other hand, Shotwell is lighter and more actively developed.\n\n11.04\nGnome Shell was replaced by Unity\nJust a small correction. They are not replacing GNOME, but only the traditional gnome-panel which is anyway going to be deprecated in coming days. Means you won't get able to use it for very long. Later in a year or two you will have to choose between Unity or gnome-shell\nRhythmbox was replaced by Banshee\nBanshee has faster development as claimed by their developers. My personal experience is that their developers are usually very passionate about the software. I have met their developers on IRC and they are more than ready to help in case of any problems.\nJust a good software is not a criteria. Active upstream development, active bug squashing, regular/predictable release schedule are the requirements. \nAlso Banshee developers tried getting Banshee on the default installation during UDS-N at Florida. This means they are taking up marketing and propagation too. I have always found them to be one of the best people in Free Software.\nOpenOffice was replaced by LibreOffice\nI think every distro is planning to do so. OpenOffice is still under the clutches of Oracle and LibreOffice development is faster. There is no copyright assignment in LibreOffice as against OpenOffice. \nYou might want to know that always Ubuntu never shipped with pure OpenOffice but with Goo-org which contains many patches which Sun was not ready to accept in OpenOffice. Goo-org was maintained by Novell primarily. The application was just branded as OpenOffice but was Goo-org\n\n11.10\nPiTiVi was dropped\nPoor reception and low rating in Software Center was cited as the major reason for dropping it. Secondly, it's target userbase was very small since it is a video editing application.\n\n12.04\nBanshee was replaced by Rhythmbox\nSpace concerns were cited for dropping Banshee which had of late had suffered some regression in quality (controversial debate). \nTomboy, gBrainy and Mono Dropped\nSince Banshee was the biggest user of mono stack, it was decided to drop Mono drop the CD itself and this Tomboy was also dropped. A game named gBrainy which also uses Mono was removed.\n\nI can understand that there are confusions, but you cannot just throw an application in default and be sure that it's development is going to be still awesome till next release.\nEvery UDS you have a track called \"Default selection track\" where changes to default applications are discussed. They discuss which application's development is slowing down or getting buggier and the have to be replaced by which applications (if that is better)\n\nMy answer can have factual inaccuracies. Please point them out. I have written the answer to best of my knowledge and memory\n", "Q: Ubuntu for netbooks I just bought a new toy an Asus EEE 1015PN. I have no experience with ubuntu but I wish to learn to use it. I wish to hear your advice. \noptional & off-topic: I didn't dig the subject, but is android a valid choice for me?\n\nA: As it's a netbook, I suggest you to try the Ubuntu Netbook edition. The page I'm linking to has a detailed guide with screenshots on installing it. All you need is a spare USB stick with at least 2GB space.\nI suggest you to Try ubuntu before actually installing it. In that way, you can see if it really fits your need.\n\nA: Since the askubuntu site is for objective questions and answers, you should get more advices at a forum like this http://ubuntuforums.org/\nAt FAQ you can read what kind of questions are expected here:  \n\nYou should only ask practical,\n  answerable questions based on actual\n  problems that you face.

I own a very similar netbook (Asus EeePC 1005PE), and Ubuntu Netbook Edition (10.04 LTS) was my first experience with Linux. It was love at first sight with its amazing netbook-oriented interface.  You will see how great it optimizes space, and how superior it is when comparing to Windows when it comes to small 10\" screens. \nI have mine dual-booting with factory-installed Windows 7 Starter... but... to be honest, in 10 months using it i may have booted Windows like 5 times only.\nAnd remember that with Ubuntu, you dont have a limited, \"starter\" edition. You a full fledged OS, complete with all software including an (Open-)Office Suite.\nI would suggest 10.04 Lucid Lynx over 10.10 Maverick Merrkat on 2 reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.04 is an LTS (Long-Term Support) version. Meaning support and updates for it will last longer (3 years) than the regular version 10.10 (1.5 years). Also, it (usually) have more stable packages, less experimental software. Its built to last longer and be more trouble-free.\n\n*10.10 lanched a whole new revamped interface. Some loved it, some hated it. But all agree that its very different from what most people are used to. So, coming from Windows world, i guess you might feel more \"confortable\"  with the more \"traditional\" 10.04 laucher.\nBoth have amazing hardware suppport for Asus EeePCs. You will find that most (if not all) FN+Keys will be working out-ot-the-box. So as Wireless, LAN, Sound, 3d-Video, Webcam, Microphone, etc. And the greatest: no need to install ANY driver! No more \"go to device website and download or install setup CDs\" anymore!\nFor netbooks, specially Asus EeePC ones, its a great choice, one I recommended whole-heartedly.\nThat said, here it is:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/netbook\n", "Q: Banshee 2.0 upgrade not available NOTE: Problem solved\nOriginal question:\n\nI have added the Banshee Stable PPA to\n  my list of Software Sources.\nLaunchpad says that 2.0 has been built\n  and it is available. \nThe problem is that the version\n  synaptic will install is 1.9.6 (I have\n  the Unstable PPA enabled too) where\n  2.0 > 1.9.6.\nBTW I am running elementary OS jupiter\n  (which is based of Maverick)\n\nANSWER : Launchpad failed to build for Maverick, Lucid, and Karmic\n\nA: Maverick, Lucid, and Karmic builds failed.\n", "Q: Can I get portable applications for Ubuntu? I dont want to use internet everytime to install common application like vlc, etc..\nIs there a site for portable apps for ubuntu ?\n\nA: PortableLinuxApps.org\n\nPortableLinuxApps provides portable applications for Linux that you can carry around and use on every Linux computer running one of the supported major distributions.\nJust Download, Make Executable, and Run!\n\nYou just have to download the file ,then make it executable and Run it!\n\n\nA: You could download its .DEB package file, copy it to a USB pendrive or CD, and then install at your friend's house, even if he doesnt have internet. Its as simple as double-clicking the .DEB file. It will open a windows telling you about the program, and, if all dependencies are satisfied, you can click \"install\". Simple as that.\nBut, i strongly recommend against doing so. Because:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your friend does not have all the packages that VLC depend upon already installed, he WILL need internet anyway to download and install them. And there's no way for you to know that a given system is \"VLC-ready\" will all the dependencies pre-installed.\n\n*There's no way you could download all the possible-necessary packages for any computer. Linux works in a different way than windows: most packages depend on other system packages and tools that other systems may or may not already have. That's what the internet APT-GET is all about: it checks what a given software needs for THAT machine in particular, and downloads and installs only the necessary missing stuff. So, there's no such thing as \"full VLC install\".\n\n*Besides, there's a VLC \"main\"  package for each Ubuntu system and architecture. Do your friend have a 64 or 32-bit Ubuntu? Which version? 10.04 Lucid, 10.10 Maverick, 9.10? Is it Ubuntu or Debian (or Mint)? Are you going to download each and every possible combination? That truly makes no sense at all.\nSo, get online and use Software Center at your friends. Its really worth it.\nWelcome to Linux, welcome to a whole new philosophy on downloading, installing, managing and updating software. It works different than Windows. But it works a LOT better.\n\nA: Just wild guessing: \nYou could search on the friends-PC for vlc-plugins:\nlocate vlc-plugin | grep deb\n/var/cache/apt/archives/vlc-plugin-ggi_1.0.6-1ubuntu1.5_i386.deb\n/var/cache/apt/archives/vlc-plugin-sdl_1.0.6-1ubuntu1.5_i386.deb\n\nYou may copy the files, and call \n dpkg -i xy.deb \n\nfor every xy.deb-File found. BUt I can't guarantee it will work - I hope I understood your question right.\n\nA: Most of Ubuntu (Linux in general) software which has no specific (read lack) dependencies may run from your home directory (or USB stick). Several steps to follow:\na) find an archived version of software you need,\nb) unarchive a software to you home folder or USB stick,\nc) set 'executable' flag in properties of main executable file,\nd) just run an executable.\nIt should be running with no complications.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to hide/unhide the panel?

Can someone suggest what may be the reason behind it?\n\nA: Are you modifying .cpp (or .C .cc etc.) files or header files? Some Makefiles are written very poorly and don't have decent dependency information (gcc -MMD or makedepend).

It creates the iso, but I can't burn to a CD (the file is 1.1gb) and the computers in question don't have DVD drives. So I tried putting the iso onto a USB instead via the included Startup Disk Creator. It boots and installs fine for the most part, but at the very end of the installation, it tells me that it can't install Grub. \nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this?\nOr, alternately, is there a tool other than remastersys that you'd suggest using for creating a distributable iso?\n\nA: APTonCD may help you. Check my related answer about a similar question:\nIts a tool that scans your APT-installed packages and build a list for you. You can then manually select/deselect the ones you want, save the list, and it can even download/use cache to save selected packages in a CD/folder (for an offline automatic install of currently installed apps)\nI know, this is not exactly what you want. But you could customize your CD install to use the .DEB files folder created by APTonCD as an additional APT-GET source list (like an offline PPA) by creating a customized entry in the /etc/apt/sources.list file.\nAnd then just create a simple post-install script to install all the packages there.\nSo, if your \"remastered install with pre-installed additional packages\" is not working, maybe this \"original install with post-install trigger to apt-get packages in a folder\" approach may work.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Here is my solution:\nBefore you remaster install grub on the system to be remastered. Somehow grub is not installed. grub-pc is installed. Install grub from synaptic. This will replace grub-pc. \nNow remaster your system.

What command I can use to check my graphics card's memory? I have an on-board Intel Graphics card, and I am unsure if it's memory is 128 MB or 256 MB! \n\nA: lspci -v | less\n\nSearch for VGA or Graphics\n\nA: If it is an Intel integrated GPU, then it would be using a unified memory model where there is no dedicated graphics memory, and instead main memory is used.  More information can be found on Wikipedia\nSo the answer is either 0MB or however much main memory you have in the machine, depending on your point of view.\nWith the modern drivers, the actual amount of memory used by the GPU will vary with the work load: there isn't a fixed amount set aside for the card.\nNote: since this question was asked, Intel has released a GPU with its own memory: the Iris Pro Graphics 5200, which has some DRAM embedded on the chip.  All other GPUs still rely on main memory.\n\nA: In a terminal run the following command line:\ngrep -i --color memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nand with gedit read the /var/log/Xorg.0.log file.\n", "Q: How do I make vim the default graphical text editor?

What is the best way to mount this ext4-filesystem with uid johndoe set?\n\nA: Assuming the group set for the files has appropriate permissions, you should be able to just find out it's Group ID (GID) and add yourself to it.\n\nTo find out the group id of a file, use ls -n. Example output:\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 1000 1000  550 Jul  9 11:08 Desktop/\n\nYou want the fourth field for GID, which in my case is the second 1000.\nsudo addgroup --gid GID foobar; sudo usermod `whoami` -aG foobar\n\nOnce you run that you should have full rein where ever the file attributes for group allow it.\nAs noted in the other answer relating to user permissions, if you need to fix the group on some files, run one of these:\nsudo chown -R :foobar ./\nsudo chgrp -R  foobar ./\n\n\nA: bindfs is the answer. It will take an already mounted file system and provide a view of it with whichever uid you'd like:\nsudo apt-get install bindfs\nmkdir ~/myUIDdiskFoo\nsudo bindfs -u $(id -u) -g $(id -g) /media/diskFoo ~/myUIDdiskFoo\n\n\nA: It's not possible to force an owner on a disk with an ext4 filesystem. Only filesystems which do not support Linux permissions like fat have an attribute for ownership/groupship: uid=value and gid=value. See the manual page on mount.\nYou should change the owner on the mounted filesystem as in:\nsudo chown johndoe /foo/bar/baz\n\nIf you need to change the permissions recursively:\nsudo chown -R johndoe /foo/bar/baz\n\n...and if the group needs to be changed to johndoe as well:\nsudo chown -R johndoe: /foo/bar/baz\n\n", "Q: How do I change my username? Some time ago, when I installed Ubuntu, I chose a rather stupid username for my account that I do not want to use anymore.\nHow do I change this (including the name of my home directory, and the name in the terminal) without losing settings for applications?\nHow do I keep permissions and my keys for various authentification (e.g. email, SSH, GPG and more)?\nWhat settings could possibly get lost if I changed my username?\n\nA: Unix-like operating systems decouple the user name from the user identity, so you may safely change the name without affecting the ID. All permissions, files, etc are tied to your identity (uid), not your username.\nTo manage every aspect of the user database, you use the usermod tool.\nTo change username and user's groupname (it is probably best to do this without being logged in):\nsudo usermod -l newUsername oldUsername\nsudo groupmod -n newUsername oldUsername\n\nThis however, doesn't rename the home folder.\nTo change home-folder, use\nsudo usermod -d /home/newHomeDir -m newUsername\n\nafter you changed the username.\nFor instance, you could logout, drop to a console (Ctrl+Alt+F1), and sudo su - to become true root (as opposed to sudo -s, where $HOME is still /home/yourname.) Maybe you also have to kill some still running processes from this user first. To do so, enter ps -u username, look for the matching PID and kill them by kill PID-number.\nUpdate: as arrange mentioned, some files may reference your old home directory. You can either keep a symlink for backward compatibility, e g ln -s /home/newname /home/oldname or you can change the file contents with sed -i.bak 's/*oldname*/*newname*/g' *list of files* It creates a backup for each file with a .bak extension.\nSome additional information for not so experienced users like me:\nAs I only have ONE user account (administrator), it would not let me change the username (\"you are already logged in\" was the response in TTY1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1).

If you created an extra user delete it.\n\n\nA: Since not all the linuces (however Ubuntu must have it) have the usermod app, there is the way you can do it manually. As of root open /etc/passwd to edit with vim or any other editor presening in the system:\nsudo vim /etc/passwd\n\nand change the user's name at the beginning of a line:\nuser:x:500:501:username:home/user:/bin/bash\n\nto:\nnewuser:x:500:501:username:home/user:/bin/bash\n\nthen if you worked of root just login, and if you have been logged in as a user, logoff, and relogin.\nOf course you have to fix /etc/shadow, and /etc/group also to the system works properly. Thanx to @JohanBoulé\nNOTE: You should use this approach carefully, to not break the system.\nNOTE: This approach is common, not only for Ubuntu, but and for ubuntu it will work, however google search will show it event for non ubuntu search, for example for embedded linux\n", "Q: LibreOffice missing certain Microsoft fonts I don't have these fonts:  times new roman, arial and calibri..., like in microsoft office?

The reason is that the package requires user EULA agreement which can only be \"clicked to agree\" via the command line installer (the software center does not show the prompt).\n\nA: I just typed in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer \n\n\nA: In case you are unable to install package \"Microsoft Core Fonts\" (as screenshot shows above), you'll need to refresh package information in order to install the package. You can do that either by issuing the command sudo apt-get update or by clicking \"Reload\" from Synaptic Package Manager from System -> Administrator.\nWhile Microsoft Core Fonts will not get you \"calibri\" fonts to be precise. You can get your own fonts in any application by creating .fonts directory in your home folder and put TTF files of your font in this directory. Note that the directory and file name starting with the dot . is hidden by default in Unix-like family of operating systems, so you'll not be able to see the directory in your file manager (Nautilus, in your case) unless you select to show hidden files and folders by pressing Ctrl+H. Once you have pasted all the required font files in the directory you created, just log out and log in again and all your applications should show you the new fonts in their font lists.\n\nA: I installed via Ubuntu Software center, didn't get the fonts, etc.\nI was able to remove the package with:\nsudo apt-get remove ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nAnd then reinstall with:\nsudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nDuring which I did get the prompt asking me to agree to the EULA. Now the fonts are there. No problem.\n\nA: Calibri Fonts:\nWhile logged into Ubuntu 14.04 I took four font files from my Windows 7 partition (In Windows these would be located at: C:\\Windows\\Fonts)and copied them to my /home/user/.fonts folder in my Linux partition.  The files I copied were: \n\n\n*\n\n*calibri.ttf\n\n*calibrib.ttf\n\n*calibrii.ttf\n\n*calibriz.ttf\n\n\nIn case you don't have a .fonts folder, you can create one as follows:\nIn Ubuntu, in the file browser you would just go to \"Home Folder\", check View->Show Hidden, then File->\"Create New\"->Folder. Make sure you name the folder \".fonts\" and not just \"fonts\". Then copy the .ttf files to that folder.\nHere is what is looks like in terminal:\n\njim@GX270-11QPFS1:~$ cd ~\njim@GX270-11QPFS1:~$ pwd\n/home/jim\njim@GX270-11QPFS1:~$ cd .fonts\njim@GX270-11QPFS1:~/.fonts$ ls\ncalibrib.ttf  calibrii.ttf  calibri.ttf  calibriz.ttf\njim@GX270-11QPFS1:~/.fonts$ \n\n\nSo now I have Calibri font in Ubuntu.\nDisclaimer: This technique is for educational purposes only.

It always go to extended desktop and then I need to check \"clone screen\" and apply. How to make it remember I always want to \"clone\"? I am using ATI open-source drivers.\n\nA: I don't think there's really a way to do that. Of course, having options is always nice, but in my experience such an option isn't really desirable, anyway.\nThe trouble is that these days, most laptops have wide screens--with varying aspect ratios--while projectors still prefer 1024x768 (4:3). If you clone the screen, you're going to get a stretched and/or low quality picture on one or both screens unless the projector knows how to compensate.\nUsing Ubuntu's default makes it possible for everything to look good, even if you have to manually set the resolution if you're using certain hardware. (The two projectors I regularly use don't adequately report their preferred resolution, leaving me with a stretched display until I manually correct it, while the TV I've been using recently in lieu of one of the projectors manages to get everything automatically configured correctly.)\nFinally, I don't think there's any real advantage to having a cloned screen. OpenOffice automatically shows presentations on the correct screen, assuming that the screen is connected and enabled when the program starts. Other windows can easily be dragged to the proper screen. Then, they'll behave correctly. And, you don't have to worry about things like your panels and icons showing up on the big screen.\n", "Q: How to remove Edit Menu Option? When we right click the main menu on the panel we get some options. Is it possible to remove Edit Menus option from that?\n\nA: Okay, this doesn't remove the menu entry, but it makes it useless, should be just what you need:\nFirst, make a backup copy of alacarte, the menu editor:\nsudo cp /usr/bin/alacarte /usr/bin/alacarte_backup\n\nNow open up the original in your favourite text editor:\nsudo gedit /usr/bin/alacarte\n\nIn between the end of the big comment on the top and the line that says \nimport sys, paste this:\nimport gtk\nmd = gtk.MessageDialog(None, \n    gtk.DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, gtk.MESSAGE_ERROR, \n    gtk.BUTTONS_CLOSE, \"Not Allowed\")\nmd.run()\nmd.destroy()\nexit(1)\n\nYou can of course replace \"Not Allowed\" with any error message you like.\nNow when you click \"edit menus\", this message will pop up:\n\nOf course this is not 'secure', a knowledgeable user will be able to get around it, but I guess that's fine in your case. I also haven't tested if any other applications break because of it, but looking at the code, that shouldn't happen.\nNote: if you want to use an error message consisting of characters outside of ASCII, make sure the it says# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the top (second or third line, not the first) of the file (it should by default).Otherwise you'll get an error.\n\nA: Stefano and I have been talking about this in Chat today. I think he's working on another direction, but I've got a couple of source-based ways to work around this.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Main Menubar applet is part of gnome-panel so you could download the source for that, make your edits to remove the Edit Menus menu option and then repackage it. The problem with this is you'll either lose your changes when you get an update or you hold the package version and go without automatic updates.\n\n*Use another sort of menu. There are some great options out there with things like Cardapio. Cardapio is Python based so it's a little easier to bend to your will. Just edit /usr/lib/cardapio/Cardapio.py. You have a few options here, you can break launch_edit_app(). Or you can hunt down where the option gets drawn using something like this:\ngrep -R 'launch_edit_app' /usr/lib/cardapio/\n\nOf course you'd want to lock down the panel to stop somebody just adding the regular menu.\n", "Q: Is there native software similar to Comic Book Life for Linux?

Its speed is limited by your output terminal, so if you pipe the result to tail -1, you'll get immediate result. You can also control to what directory level you like the results, using the -L option. For colorized output, use -C.

EDIT - please close this as a dup (was closed for the wrong reason). Here is the existing question: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1237/what-are-the-most-useful-programs-installed-after-setup-of-a-vanilla-ubuntu\nI'm a new ubuntu/linux user. What essential apps should I install, and what configuration tweaks will make my life easier?\n\nA: First of all welcome to Ubuntu and Linux as a whole! One of the things that you'll learn about Linux is that there are lot's of great applications and it is very much up to you which ones you will love the most and use. Any answers here should be taken as suggestions rather than definitive truth.\nThe only thing I would absolutely insist on installing is the Ubuntu Restricted Extras package. This will install all of your media plugins, flash, java, quicktime related plugins all with one click!\nFor protected DVD playback see here: Playing DVD's\nthe applications I tend to use on my laptop are:\nSynapse - A quick application launcher that is very responsive, pretty, and actively developed. (in the ppa:synapse-core/ppa repository)\nNautilus Elementary - Makes nautilus look much nicer and simpler to navigate. Also comes with great features like an embedded terminal and CoverFlow (in the ppa:am-monkeyd/nautilus-elementary-ppa repository)\nFaenza Icon Pack - A fantastic icon pack. Very subjective though, take a look at it before you try installing it, because you might not like it as much as some people do. (in the ppa:tiheum/equinox repository)\nGIMP Image Editor - A free and open source image manipulation software (along the lines of Photoshop, but not quite identical)\nMozilla Thunderbird - An excellent mail / news client. Much simpler and more intuitive than the default Evolution.\nCheese - A webcam application with a lot of cool effects. Kind of like the photobooth all the kids use in the Apple store. \nSkype - The Linux version is stable and has the major features you need from the Windows or OS X versions.\nVLC - An Excellent video player that can handle any kind of video format with no problem. \nAll of the above can be downloaded by searching for them in the Software Center unless I have specified that they are available in another repository.\nYou can add new repositories to the Software Center by opening a Terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal) and typing in \"sudo add-apt-repository ppa:name/of/ppa\" without the quotation marks. \nIf I haven't specified something like a music player, it's because I think that you should experiment with all of the available ones until you find one that you like! Just go through the Software Center and try out things that look interesting, you can always uninstall them if you don't like them.\nGood Luck and I hope you find what you enjoy!\n\nA: I have 2 programms, that I install especially on a laptop with Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*TLP - This is a software package that improves saves battery power.

I just deleted my VirtualBox.dvi file and lost valuable information.\nI'm using Ubuntu 9.04 and the VirtualBox is a Windows XP image.\nDetail 1: I deleted using gnome, not terminal. \nDetail 2: The file isn't in trash, because when I saw that I was removing the file, I have canceled operation. So the file isn't in original folder neither in trash folder.\nI want to use foremost or scalpel, but I don't know how to use these programs with dvi files...\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: If the dvi file was located on the same partition as Ubuntu (or is in use by you) there is a small chance for recovery. Foremost and scalpel both read directly from the disk or partition, and need to be instructed to work with the correct header and file end. As VDI's are often some gigabytes in size, it's not getting easier.\nIf you want to take the foremost approach, I would suggest looking for the header format using your favorite search engine. In any case, if your vdi was located on the disk you are currently using, power the machine off and use a LiveCD so your disk does not get touched.\n", "Q: How to set both dual cores to userspace governor I am trying to set both cores in my cpu to userspace governor by editing the contents of \n\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nand \n\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nto be userspace. \nBut after half of a minute, automatically, the content of the \"cpu0\" file changes back to \"performance\" and often jumps between \"performance\" and \"powersave\", while the content of the \"cpu1\" file remains \"userspace\". \n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor\nuserspace\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\npowersave\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\nperformance\n\nI was wondering \n\n\n*\n\n*why the \"cpu0\" file is edited\nautomatically back,\n\n*if it means that manually modifying\nits content is bad for some reason?\n\n*Anyway to manually change its\ncontent to be \"userspace\"?\n\n\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: You don't normally set it to userspace manually; you run a user space governor and it takes over.  What userspace governor are you wanting to run and why?\nAs for why it keeps changing back, you must be running another program that is changing it.\n\nA: So is your question how can you manually change your all of your cpu's to run at a certain scaling frequency? If so I have 2 options you can choose from.\n1 --  Change the \"/etc/init.d/ondemand\" file that sets the initial cpu frequency to \"your_choice\" after the system boots up.  By default Ubuntu chooses to set your cpu's at the frequency ondemand using this file.  To change this, open the file and look for the code:\necho -n ondemand > $CPUFREQ\nAll you have to change is the word \"ondemand\" to your choice, for example I use \"conservative\" to cut down on some heat from my CPU.  My code looks like this:\necho -n conservative > $CPUFREQ\nAlso if you notice 3 lines above our selected code, it says \"sleep 60\".  This just means that 60 seconds after your computer boots up it will execute this file and change the CPU frequency.\n2 -- Taking a reference from the \"/etc/init.d/ondemand\" file you can manually change the CPU frequency through a terminal command.  If you don't want to restart the computer this a great command.  Create an empty file somewhere on your desktop and fill it with this:\n#!/bin/sh\nfor CPUFREQ in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\ndo\n    [ -f $CPUFREQ ] || continue\n    echo -n conservative > $CPUFREQ\ndone\n\nMake sure and change the frequency to what you want and all you have to do is open a terminal and type (without quotes) \"sudo sh name_of_file\".

I understand that tracker is no longer installed by default on the Ubuntu desktop. Nevertheless, I really like having a desktop search tool. (When I used to work with Windows XP I thought that Google Desktop was a killer app!).\nI recently upgraded to Natty and reinstalled tracker. I noticed that the most updated version found in Universe (and on the Tracker stable PPA) is of version 0.8.17, yet looking at the Tracker website apparently the most updated version is 0.10, and they are working on 0.11. WOuld love to know if we should expect updates and if work is being done for integration with Unity.\nI would also love to know if there are any real alternatives to have a desktop search tool which cleanly integrates with Unity (which has become default with Natty).\n\nA: Tracker's packages are sync'd from the Debian project as is a lot of the software in the Ubuntu repositories. So getting an updated version depends on the upstream keeping the package updated and getting it updated in Debian. From there it will be sync'd into the Ubuntu repositories every new release.\nI'm uncertain of Tracker's life in the Ubuntu project. Zeitgeist has replaced Tracker in Unity for desktop searching and indexing and is already integrated into the Unity interface. Using Dash you can search through files, folders, contacts, applications, and many other aspects of the desktop - all powered through Zeitgeist.\n\nA: From http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/04/04/%23ubuntu-desktop.txt:\n\n<seb128> chrisccoulson, btw should be [we] try to get tracker 0.10 synced from debian or something,\n  <seb128> ?\n  <seb128> it seems like that's the sort of things where we should better get the current serie\n  <chrisccoulson> seb128 - i don't mind. i haven't tried it yet (i haven't looked at tracker in ages)\n  <chrisccoulson> it probably would be good to have though\n\nSo I'd be mildly optimistic that Tracker 0.10 will land in Ubuntu 11.04. There's also a bug report to follow.\n\nA: OK, after a while, turns out that there is indeed progress done on that front.\nFollowing this bug report (previously mentioned in @htorque's answer) the new stable release of tracker 0.10.x is indeed packaged and will be in the universe repository of Ubuntu. Mild bad news, it is currently only packaged for oneiric (11.10) - hope this changes and it is backported to Natty.\n\nA: More progress: Precise 12.04 packages Tracker version 0.14.0-2ubuntu1\nBut it is not installed by default.\nSee also What is the best desktop search tool? - Ask Ubuntu\n", "Q: What gaming resources for ubuntu(or gnu/linux in general) are there? what websites(databases,news sites etc) are available ? what repos are there ? \ninclude one resource per answer with a short description on the resource .\n\nA: You should probably start here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games\nAlso, does anyone need another game besides Minecraft?\nGotta add one more.

I am using it to stream Pandora for some musical goodness while I work, and the sound quality is just awful. Is there a way to select/change/update the audio codec used to stream the signal to the headset for better sound quality?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: For high quality streaming the codec used needs to be set to A2DP. This can be done in pulseaudio audio settings by choosing the appropriate (A2DP) profile in the Hardware tab.\nIf your sound quality is still poor then unfortunately the SBC codec (that is included as a fallback for low bandwith in the A2DP profile) may be used. You may want to test if in your individual settings this is improved when running the most recent Bluez package (however you would need to compile this from source).

Menu -> Settings -> Setting Manager -> Workspaces will show margins on the right side. \nThe numbers around the square are the distance from the edge to use for the workspace. By changing those, you can force the applications to not go outside the visible area. \nYou can still manually move windows outside the margins, but opening windows and maximising applications will stay in the margin set.\n", "Q: Installed Wacom Bamboo Pen + Touch drivers, but no dice I'm trying to install my new Wacom Bamboo Pen + Touch tablet in Ubuntu 10.10.

The problem is that most people don't know where to look ^^. \nWhen it comes to the applications shown in your menu they can all be found under the /usr/share/applications directory. Every entry is of the file-type \"*.desktop\", these are textual files and you can edit them in vim or gedit ( do know that they're under root, so either chown them or sudo edit them ). If you delete the entry it won't show up in your menu anymore :). As for adding entries, it is just a matter of learning how to write a *.desktop file and placing it in the applications directory. \nTo learn more about the \".desktop\" file format i'll refer you to http://linuxcritic.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/anatomy-of-a-desktop-file/ :) enjoy ! \nThis might be a wee bit archaic ^ ^ but give the open source community a few more months and someone will have written an updated version of alacarte that does this for you :) \n", "Q: Set default account in Empathy metacontact When I link contacts in empathy, facebook becomes the default account used in a new chat. \nIs there a way to change the default account? I'd like to avoid using facebook whenever possible, and instead have different preferred accounts to use for different people.\n\nA: I gave this a try and I see what you mean. When you link contacts together, the accounts have some kind of sorting applied.\nFor me: MSN accounts always come before GTalk accounts and accounts for the same protocol are sorted alphabetically. I'm guessing this is because my MSN name comes before my gtalk name in the alphabet.\nDouble clicking on your meta contact to start a chat uses the first account in the sorted list.

I have a budget of Rs 6000( US $136 approx. ) . How do I check the external hard disk that I purchase would support operations for multiple OS's( especially linux ).\nFor e.g. I referred to this offer from ebay:- \nhttp://cgi.ebay.in/1TB-W-D-3-0-Passport-External-Portable-Hard-Disk-BILL-/260763580999?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_203&hash=item3cb6b87a47#ht_3869wt_1141\nThis and many similar offers never have any mention of whether or not they support Linux OS. I could see that they support Mac OS.\nI am planning to reserve around 450 GB for Ubuntu and say remaining 450 for use with either Windows 7/XP . Would I be able to successfully implement this scenario?\nCan I boot Ubuntu directly from this hard disk? Or if not, can this external hard disk be used as a mount point for more than machines which have the same version of Ubuntu installed on it( this would serve the purpose like a normal usb pen drive, right?). In my case I specifically have a PC and a laptop both having Ubuntu 10.04 OS Installed on it. The only diff is that the PC has Win XP installed and the Laptop has Win 7 installed.\nCan you please help me on this and suggest me on what features do I need to look in for when I would be purchasing an external hard disk and would want to use it for the above scenario. \nIn any case if the above scenario can't be implemented, could you please suggest alternative best solutions which can be considered.\nThank you..\n\nA: I have never seen an external hard disk which is incompatible with Ubuntu. Most external HDD's work \"plug & play\". The software (or crapware) delivered with the package might not be compatible, but it does not matter.\nThe software delivered with that external HDD:\n\n\n*\n\n*encryption software, alternative: LUKS\n\n*SmartWare (backup software?), alternative: deja-dup (front-end of duplicity)\n\n*In some cases, partitioning software is included, the alternative would be GParted\n\n\nTo get the full power out of it, I recommend formatting the Linux partition ext4 and the Windows one NTFS. You can use GParted for that.\nUbuntu can be booted from external HDD's, you might need to enable booting from USB drives in your BIOS or change the booting order to make the external HDD be booted before the internal one.\n", "Q: Install mod_jk with apt-get Is it possible to install mod_jk via apt-get?

I do like them, but I don't like the current mix of scrollbar types as many applications don't yet use those overlay scrollbars.\nIs there a way to disable overlay scrollbars (without removing the overlay-scrollbar package)?\n\nA: You can disable the scrollbars either\n\n*\n\n*For your user:\nAdd the line\n  export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0\n\nto the file ~/.xprofile (create one, if it doesn't exist).\n\n\n*Or globally:\nCreate a file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99disable-overlay-scrollbars and add above line (requires root permissions, see this answer about how to create a file as root).\n\n\n*Or per application:\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to blacklist an individual application from using overlay-scrollbars?\n\nA: Simply use utility dconf-editor or gconf-editor. If it is not already present you can install this from Ubuntu Software Center.\nThis utility is like Windows registry-editor where you can tweak system settings.\nFrom entry org > gnome > Desktop > Applications.you find an item named ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars. Toggle the item off, logout/login and you're ready.\n\nA: Maybe you're talking about ayatana scrollbar!\nin the case that you want to have the old scrollbar style you only need to use the next command:\nsudo apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar3\n\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 you can just install Ubuntu Tweak and the option to disable the vertical overlay scrollbar is in Tweaks -> Miscellaneous. You'll need to log-off or reboot for the changes to take effect.\nIf you want the overlay scrollbar back at some point, you just go and enable it back again in the app. In addition you get a large number of tweaks at your disposition. I'd say this is the easiest way to achieve this.\n\nA: You can remove the scrollbars completely by typing\nsudo apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar\n\n\nA: Try the following:  \necho \"export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0\" > /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80overlayscrollbars\n\nYou'll probably need to log off once.\nMore information / ideas can be found here.\n\nA: On 15.10 wily (libgtk-3-0) this worked for me:\nexport GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0\n\n\nA: Just disabling or removing the overlay-scrollbars as described by the other answers will get you back the scroll bars, but they will be missing the stepper buttons at the end of the bars because they have been disabled in the Ambiance theme. To re-enable them, put the following in the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:\nstyle \"default\" {\n  engine \"murrine\" {\n    stepperstyle = 0\n  }\n}\n\nand the following into the file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:\n.scrollbar {\n  -GtkScrollbar-has-backward-stepper: 1;\n  -GtkScrollbar-has-forward-stepper: 1;\n}\n\nUsually, restarting the applications is enough for the changes to apply.\n\nA: In 12.04 LTS there's a slightly cleaner way to do it. Just run\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars false\n\nin a terminal. Apps opened afterwards will have the non-ayatana scrollbar.\nTo get the default behavior back, run\ngsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars\n\nIf you are using 12.10 or later, run\ngsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal\n\nAnd to return to the default, run\ngsettings reset com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode\n\n\nA: When you try to uninstall liboverlay-scrollbar doesn't find it! To get rid of the transparent bars was easily fixed. I use leafpad. \nOpen a terminal :\n\n\n*\n\n* gksudo leafpad /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99disable-overlay-scrollbars  \n\n*Put your password in.\n\n*Type  export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 \n\n*Save, Exit and reboot.\n\n\nNo more overlay slidebars or transparent slidebars.\n\nA: Enabling classic/old style scrollbars\nFor Ubuntu 14.x there are two ways:\nJust use command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal\n\nOr install Unity Tweak Tool.\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nGo to System > Scrollbars and set to Legacy.\nChanging colors and appearance\nAfter one of these two steps, you can further enhance the look of scrollbars if you are using default Ambiance theme. To do this, fire up (if you don't have sublime editor then replace it with whatever editor you are using like nano or gedit).\nsudo subl /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css\n\nPress Ctrl+F and type .scrollbar to find style section for scrollbars.

Someone deemed 'overlay-auto' the default. Just thankful to be rid of this horrifically unhelpful 'feature'. It cost me about two hours to find a solution.

How do I download HTML5 videos in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Depends on the site. Firefox has context menus for saving html5 video, but they don't work if the site uses a customized player. For example, if you visit http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/video/, you will be able to right-click and select the Save video option.\nOn YouTube, that won't work. In this case, click the YouTube logo in the address bar, then click More information in the mini popup, then click the Media tab in the big popup dialog, then find the video and select it, then click Save As. Change the extension to webm before saving.\nAlternatively, you can copy the address and load it on some download manager like DownThemAll or wget via terminal.\nHowever, on YouTube is simpler to use Video Download Helper.\n\n\nA: With JDownloader you can download almost every kind of content available on the web. Its up-to-date addon system allows to select available quality and filetype easily (video-audio/audio only).\nNot the easiest way but it's one of the most effective.\nEDIT: Just discovered youtube-dl command. Its GUI version is also available through a WebUpd8's PPA, but is not that powerful as its backend. As I said before, is one of the most powerful CLI tools to download videos from almost anywhere in the web.\nIt can be installed from WebUpd8's PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install youtube-dl\n\nOr if you don't want to add a PPA, install latest version:\nsudo curl https://yt-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl\nsudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl\n\nUpdate package without apt:\nyoutube-dl -U\n\nAnd if you want to keep its manual in a text file (recommended), type this:\nman youtube-dl > \"youtube-dl manpage.txt\"\nyoutube-dl --help > \"youtube-dl quick help.txt\"\n\nNow go to your home (~) directory and pick them up, so you can work with the reference in one hand and the terminal in the other.\n\nA: A Simple Way:\nJust right click the video frame that is playing the video, and select \"Copy Video URL\" (depending on the browser you use) and paste the link in the address bar, and the browser should ask you to save the file.\nA Better Way:\nIn case you're fond of downloading the video you see, whether on YouTube (Mostly based on Flash) or any other site (in case of HTML5 videos), you have two options,\n\n*\n\n*Using download manager and add video urls (HTML 5 Videos will give you direct URLs).\n\n*Using something like Greasemonkey script that will add a \"Download\" button underneath any video you see in YouTube (Preferred for Flash videos, as they'll not have direct links).\n\nIn case of download manager for Ubuntu, I'll recommend DownThemAll add-on for Firefox (default web browser for Ubuntu).\nAnd for adding \"Download\" button in YouTube, first you'll need to install Greasemonkey in the Firefox and then, use this userscript to add that \"awesome\" button in YouTube. And good thing is that the this Greasemonkey script is available for other web browsers as well.\nUpdate\nThe Greasemonkey script mentioned in above URL doesn't work, however, I'm currently using this firefox add-on which works just fine and adds a pretty download button below the video frame.\n\nA: If you use Firefox, they have a downloader, and for some videos it might require the installation of a companion app, which is quite straightforward. For me it works with 99% of videos on pages I visit with the Fox, if there is a video on the page you click on the icon and it offers you several options including to convert from one format to another. Magic for me.\n\n", "Q: How can I make NetworkManager assign specific addresses and names to machines that connect via \"Shared to other computers\"? It appears as if, in Ubuntu 10.10, NetworkManger uses dnsmasq to implement the \"Shared to other computers\" method.  This is work fairly well for me, but I want the machines that connect to get specific IPs and names.  I would have thought this would be as simple as creating the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file with a bunch of dhcp-host lines in it, but NetworkManager seems to be using a custom configuration (/tmp/randomfilename.conf) instead of the one in /etc.  Is there some way to edit the config file NetworkManger uses, or is there some way in the GUI to do what I want?\n\nA: There is no way unfortunately. The settings are currently hard-coded in NetworkManager; since they need to match at multiple different levels (the dnsmasq configuration needs to match with the generated iptables rules for connection sharing to work, since it relies on NAT and IP forwarding).\nNote that the file generated in /tmp/ has never contained any data, and won't; it's an empty file that used to be passed to avoid using other configuration files for dnsmasq, since they'd interfere with setting up connection sharing.\n", "Q: After paying for my music ubuntu-one-music-store tells me my network is down, yet it's not!

The installer will ask you where to install and what to do with existing operating systems.\nUpon successful installation you will be presented with a boot loader (GRUB) that allows you to select the operating system that is to be started.\n\nA: Yes they can and am pretty sure this was answered somewhere else about Windows 7 and Ubuntu but anyway you only need to do the following to have them Dual boot together:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 7 FIRST Do NOT!! install Ubuntu first then Windows or you will have to do some additional steps. Install Windows 7 first.\n\n*After you have it install (Do not worry about partition space and the likes) then insert the Live CD from Ubuntu 10.10 and boot from it. I do not recommend loading the Wubi to avoid some problems that sometime happen with it. Instead BOOT from the Ubuntu Live CD (you need to either change your Bios Setup to boot from CD but most PCs/Laptops that have a CDROM/DVDROM already boot by default from the CD/DVD. After you have booted from the Live CD continue with the installation of Ubuntu and it will be a breeze since you can select how much space you want for Windows and for Ubuntu in one easy draggable way.\n\n*After Ubuntu finished the Boot manager for Windows 7 and Ubuntu will be GRUB. It will be just an easy way to select which operating system to boot from.\n\nA: I have a dual installation. To keep things clean I keep my operating systems in separate partions.\nNTFS for windows installation\nEXT4 for ubuntu\nSWAP for ubuntu also swap space\nThe procedure is quite straight forward. Intalling both operating systems Windows preferably first. And you use grub loader to pick one in the beggining.\nIf for some reason you cannot see your windows option in the grub loader I can guide you to add the entry to it and make it work.\nRecently I was glad to figure out how I can also boot my windows installation from a VirtualBox inside ubuntu :)\n\nA: As everyone suggests, Install windows 7 first, and then resize the partition from within windows (I suggest this from experience). To do this, right click on my computer, click manage, and go to devices. Then resize the hard drive to leave the amount of free space you want ubuntu to have. Do not format the empty space.\nRestart the system with the ubuntu live CD/USB, and follow the install instructions. When you get to the part about disk space, choose to use the available free space.\nAs said before, ubuntu will provide a boot loader that allows you to choose your OS on startup.\n", "Q: Spotify under Wine I am running Spotify under Wine. However, it keeps getting interrupted now and then, and I have to restart Spotify. (I am running Ubuntu 10.10 and Wine 1.2.2).\nHow is this fixed?\nI have tried switching from the Alsa Driver to the OSS Driver in the Wine configurations, but then I get a message that there is no sound card found.\nAre there any others options?\n\nI forgot to add; I only have a regular Spotify account, therefore I cannot use Spotify for Linux.\n\nA: There is a developing version for Linux for it here: http://www.spotify.com/int/download/previews/\nIt shows you step by step how to add the repository and install it.\nA simple guid on how to solve \"some\" of the problems with Spotify is here: http://www.spotify.com/int/help/faq/wine/\nAnd a testing done using the 1.3.x branch shows as Platinum here: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=22244\nJust to add, if you are using the 1.2 Stable branch i recommend moving to the 1.3 \"Unstable branch\". I have been testing it for several games, office products and the likes and works much better than the Stable one.\nThe install guide is here thanks to Scott Ritchie: http://www.winehq.org/download/deb\nIf you want to know what version you have just run in the terminal wine --version\n\nA: My solution is to upgrade Wine to 1.3 with pulseaudio support built in - then Wine apps will play nice with all the other audio sources of Ubuntu.\nNot sure if it works with 10.10, I can confirm it works with 10.04:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/05/install-wine-with-built-in-pulseaudio.html\n\nA: You can download your Spotify songs via the tool DumpMedia. Then you won't get interrupted by Wine. Here are the steps for you:\n\n*\n\n*Download and Launch the DumpMedia Application\nBefore you can start using the application, of course, you need to download the software first. After downloading the DumpMedia installer, launch the application by following the steps below for Windows and macOS operating systems.\n\n\n*Add Your Spotify Song to the Application\nAdd the URI of your Spotify song/playlist/album on the search bar or you can drag and drop your files to the application.\n\n\n*Choose Your Desired Output Format and Destination Folder\nLook for the Convert all tasks to text at the top right corner of the interface. Select your desired output format (FLAC, WAV, M4A, or MP3). At the bottom of the interface, click on the Browse button and browse your computer to the desired destination folder of the converted files.\n\n\n*Start the Conversion Process\nClick the Convert button to start the conversion of your Spotify music files. Wait for a few minutes and the conversion will be completed. Now all you need to do is to check out the converted files in your local folder.\n", "Q: Domain name isn't assigned from DHCP when booting from Live CD I downloaded the ubuntu 10.10 ISO image for AMD64. When i start the ISO ubuntu gets an IP address from my DHCP server. NetworkManager updates /etc/resolv.conf according to the DNS config provided by DHCP. \nBut NM does not apply the domain name to /etc/hosts. When i do 'hostname -f' i simple get 'ubuntu', but it should be 'ubuntu.mydomain.com'. Any ideas what's wrong here?\nIs it my DHCP server or is it some missing config in ubuntu?\n\nA: DHCP doesn't reliably give a domain name; but really a search domain for users to be able to quickly reach other systems by their short name rather than a full domain name.\nIt should be up to the DHCP server to hand off IP addresses (and hostname) that will match what's in DNS, or to take the hostname passed by the machine to update DNS information. Unfortunately, we're not quite there yet.\nNote, there's a long-standing bug about the behavior of hostname -f in Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netcfg/+bug/8980\n", "Q: BBC iPlayer error \"A Problem Occurred While Downloading This Programme\" I'm using BBC iPlayer Desktop v.3.0.10 with Adobe Air v.2.6.0 on Ubuntu 11.04 'Natty Narwhal' Beta 1 86x on a Dell Inspiron 1525\nNo matter what programme I attempt to download I will get the message \"A problem occurred while downloading this programme.\"\nI thought I had fixed the problem when I followed the instructions on the below link under the \"Troubleshooting GnomeKeyring\" section however this doesn't stick after logging out\nhttp://kb2.adobe.com/cps/492/cpsid_49267.html\nSo any ideas?\nI've asked on the Official Iplayer Message Board's and have also emailed the BBC and tweeted to them but as of yet haven't heard anything back about the problem.\nHere's a copy of the \"iplayer.log\" file:\nhttp://pastebin.com/0H4s6R0x\n\nA: I would recommend that you download get-iplayer, which is better than the BBC's own iPlayer Desktop.\nEssentially get-iplayer allows you to download whole TV and radio programmes from the BBC  's server without a limit being imposed on how long you get to view or listen to the content; what you have downloaded you can use forever.\nHere's how to install it.\n1: In a terminal, run the following (type it in and press Enter).\nsudo apt-get install get-iplayer\n\nType in your password and then press Enter.

According to several comments in the web most DHCP clients simply ignore the hostname provided by the DHCP server. Does Ubuntu use the provided hostname?\nIf not, how can Ubuntu be persuaded to use the provided hostname?\n\nA: It seems you can do that with /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf's option:\nrequest host-name;\nSee the example at the end of dhclient.conf(5)\n\nA: Setting an empty hostname (which is contained in /etc/hostname) works for at least Ubuntu 14.04 (just be sure to renew your DHCP-lease or restart of course).\nThen as an optional step - if you care about messages like unable to resolve host <hostname> - you would have to change /etc/hosts dynamically to point your loopback address to the acquired hostname.\nUsing Ubuntu 14.04 you could place a script in /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d containing the following to accomplish that optional step:\n\nif [ -n \"${new_host_name}\" ]; then\n  sed -i \"/127.0.1.1/c\\127.0.1.1 ${new_host_name}\" /etc/hosts\nfi\n\nThen of course make it executable by means of chmod +x my-custom-script.\n\nA: Let's not talk about how much time I spent finding this answer, but here it is:\nswitch from isc dhcpclient to dhcpcd5, and it will JUST WORK!\nNo need to hack around trying to get dhclient-exit-hooks.d to work, no need to hack around getting something to run /etc/init.d/hostname.sh, just run dhcpcd, renew your lease, and there you are.\n", "Q: Why do I get a \"the location is not a folder\" error when trying to open files using Dash or Synapse? Within the last few days, I've encountered errors when trying to open files using Unity Dash, Synapse, or even the Gnome Search Tool. \nThese methods will let me launch applications and folders, but not files of any time, including mp3, doc, odt, and txt. With any method, the same error dialogue results: \"the location is not a folder\". Is there something I can do on my end to correct this, or is this a bug in Natty that is still being corrected?\n\nA: Here is the solution without removing exo-utils:\n\nIf you want to simply fix the opening\n  of files but retain XFCE/exo you can\n  simply open\n  \"exo-preferred-applications\" and\n  change the preferred \"file manager\"\n  under \"utilities\" back to \"Thunar\"\nI'm guessing the install of XFCE\n  changes this default, anyway flipping\n  it back to thunar certainly fixes the\n  behaviour in Unity for me.\n\n\nA: This is really a bug in exo-utils package. (Reported Launchpad Bug)\nIt is an upstream problem with the desktop files which install wrong handlers for the things (that is if you do not use XFCE)...\nThe \"MimeType=\" entry in the:\n/usr/share/applications/exo-file-manager.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/exo-mail-reader.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/exo-web-browser.desktop\n\nfiles should become: \"X-XFCE-MimeType=\"\nA quick fix for your problem is to change the entry as needed and update your desktop file database.\nChanging the entry can be done as root in a terminal this way:\nsed -i -e 's/^MimeType=/X-XFCE-MimeType=/' \\\n     /usr/share/applications/exo-file-manager.desktop \\\n     /usr/share/applications/exo-mail-reader.desktop \\\n     /usr/share/applications/exo-web-browser.desktop\n\nI have prepared a package with the fixed bug in my PPA, so you can install it (you may need to wait till it builds btw) (PhobosK's PPA)\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove exo-utils\nthis is from xfce. You might need to remove thunar as well.\nFixed it for me anyway.\n\nA: This is likely a problem in xdg-open and gnome-open. There is a bug page for that problem here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-place-files/+bug/751374. You should try typing 'xdg-open '. If the file opens correctly then you're experiencing a different problem. If it gives the 'location is not a folder' error then keep and eye out for fixes to this but.\nFor the record xdg-open does not work for me, and uninstalling/reconfiguring some packages hasn't fixed it. Knowing which package needs removing/updating would be useful, molnarandris.\n\nA: Removing exo-utils also removes thunar.

Opensuse 11.4 is doing it by default.\n\nA: Some packages are already compressed using xz, and there is increasing support for this in the tools.  While this improves the space situation for the alternate images, live and preinstalled images are distributed with the packages unpacked, and so do not benefit from this.\nLive images are unlikely to be converted to use xz anytime soon, as the current squashfs-lzma breaks rsync/zsync, significantly raising the bandwidth requirements for mirroring the image archives.  If this is confirmed as fixed, there is likely great interest in switching, as there is never enough space for everything desired on a CD.\nPreinstall images are unlikely to be converted to use xz in the short term, due to relative unfamiliarity and a desire to support a wide range of intermediate environments used to convert the distributed image to an on-disc format.\n\nA: Well, Ubuntu (at least 10.10) uses SquashFS on the root filesystem (the filesystem that gets mounted when one boots) located in /casper/filesystem.squashfs.\n", "Q: How do I mount a Motorola Xoom so I can sync music?

I have an HP pen-drive that has 16GB space. If I add a file to it, and then I delete that file, the free space of that deleted file doesn't get applied. The only way I've found to see that space as available again is by deleting the partition and doing it all over again! \nWhy is this? Any clue?\nI've used KDE Partition Manager to create the NTFS partition.\n\nA: In Nautilus, use the 'Show Hidden Files' option off the 'View' menu.\nYou should then see the '.Trash' folder. You can now Shift+Delete that folder, freeing up the space.\n\nA: I have found that nautilus changed behaviour sometime in the last year from actually deleting files on removable media to putting them into a hidden directory named .Trash or similar in the top-level directory of the media.\nThis is great for \"oops\"es, but did catch me unawares the first time I \"deleted\" 2GB of a 4GB thumb and still had no extra space.\nI didn't explore if Empty Trash was available or worked, I just rm -rf the offending directory.\n\nA: To avoid all this, try using the shift+delete functionality. This way, deleted files do not go to trash. \nThis is described in How to delete files bypassing trash\n\nA: I have seen this happen a couple of times; I have solved this by ejecting the USB key. Then nautilus then goes and soft of commits the changes you made to the USB stick. weird I know, but it seems to have worked for me.\n", "Q: Galaxy S not detected, how do I make it work?

I'm on Ubuntu 10.10, and I've just joined the Linux world coming from OS X.\nI'm learning about runlevels and the rc directory in /etc/, and everywhere (manuals, tutorials, etc) I'm reading about inittab. But I can't find it in my Ubuntu installation. Why? Does Ubuntu follow the runlevel model? How are rc and levels loaded without inittab?\n\nA: No, it does not follow the runlevel model.  Ubuntu has moved away from sysV init to upstart instead.  The main reason for this was to parallelize the initialization process to vastly reduce boot time.\n\nA: As most of the answers here state, That Debian/Ubuntu have switched from sysV to systemd, and systemd has it's own way of managing the boot targets (which was called runlevels) here are the commands used to set the default or switching to another target provided by systemctl:\n\n*\n\n*systemctl isolate used to switch between targets\n\n*\n\n*systemctl isolate multi-user switchs to the multi user target\n\n*systemctl isolate graphical switchs to the graphical interface target\n\n\n\n*systemctl get-default outputs the current default target\n\n\n*systemctl set-default changing the default boot target\n\n*\n\n*systemctl set-default multi-user will set the default boot target to the multi user target and this will simple get done by creating a symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target points to /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target\n\n*systemctl set-default graphical setting back the default boot target to the graphical interface\n\n\n\n*Resources: amazingly explained by Shawn Powers in this YouTube video\n\nA: If you do man inittab in your terminal, all shall be revealed:\n   The  /etc/inittab  file was the configuration file used by the original\n   System V init(8) daemon.\n\n   The Upstart init(8) daemon does not use this file,  and  instead  reads\n   its  configuration  from  files  in  /etc/init.   See  init(5) for more\n   details.\n\n\nA: Back in the days the \"System-V\" init service was used in Ubuntu, and it used the /etc/inittab file.\nSome time ago (around 2006) the \"Upstart\" init service replaced SysV. During these days you could follow the top answer and use man inittab to get info on this change.\nAt the time of writing (e.g. for Ubuntu 16.04) the \"systemd\" boot process is in use and there is no reference left to \"inittab\" (e.g. if you do apropos inittab you'll probably not find anything). Instead you could do man runlevel to get similar information.\nBottom line: the /etc/inittab file is nowhere, likely because you use a newer version for Ubuntu that has a different init service, e.g. systemd.\n\nA: While searching this in various forum, I got to know that /etc/inittab is not anymore used in debian distro.\nIt uses /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf\n", "Q: MacBook Air 11\" (Late 2010) Touchpad/Trackpad doesn't work Just upgraded my MacBook Air 3,1 (11\" Late 2010) from Maverick to Natty Beta 1.\nTrackpad stopped working.

Brand new to Linux, the battery became disabled while I had Vista running on my Lenovo Z61t.

Love the new OS but the battery issue persists.\nAny benevolent suggestions?\n\nA: The battery can not be \"disabled\".

There once was a tool called Active Work Tracker for Windows from Brigsoft.\nWhat it basically did was to monitor user activity, sound alarm after a predefined period (say 60 minutes), wait another predefined time (say 5 minutes) when user was supposed to take a break (which was recognized as lack of activity), and repeat the whole procedure.\nIn addition, it recorded the total time user spends on his computer and presented nice charts.\nI wonder whether there is a similar application for Ubuntu?\nYou can see more detailed description of Active Work Tracker at http://www.abstime.com/bsactivity/\n\nA: You can define a keyboard lock (typing break) in System->Preferences->Keyboard:\n\nHowever with this settings the total time a user worked without a break are neither logged nor displayed.\n\nA: RSIBreak. (Click To Install)\n\n\n\nRepetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is an illness which can occur as a result of continuous work with a mouse and keyboard. The risk of suffering injury increases the longer users work without breaks. RSIBreak simply offers reminders to take a break now and then.\nAfter the start it will show up in your system tray and will monitor your activity. Whenever it detects that you have been active for a certain amount of time (configurable) it will prompt you for a break. It has some settings so if you walk away from your keyboard, it can reset the timers, so you will not be bothered with a break right after you return from that coffee break.\nYou can setup RSIBreak to popup a tiny notification popup to remind you to take a break, but you can also configure it to black out your screen so you can not continue working. All to your liking.\n\nSince this is a kde app you should see this to make it look native in gnome\n\nA: Other solutions include Workrave (Gnome/GTK+, so no need for special styling) and Xwrits (X-libraries only, but interface is weaker IMO).\nThis article compares all three:\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9114\n", "Q: su command + authentication failure I am having problems with the su command. I know my password and I am typing it correctly but su indicates authentication failure.\nSo I checked on the internet and then went into recovery mode and changed my username's password to what I was entering before.\nEven now entering the same password on su gives me authentication failure.\nPlease suggest what am I doing wrong??\n\nA: su asks for the root password. Since Ubuntu doesn't set a root password by default, you can't use it to become root. \nInstead, to become root, use sudo -i with your personal password.\n\nA: when you need to login as one of your non-login userids say git ( has no pwd)\nsu - git\nPassword: \nsu: Authentication failure\n\nSOLUTION - use this syntax to login as userid git\nsudo su - git\n\n\nA: I came across an OS, Minibian, where the setuid bit was missing from /bin/su, causing this error, even if the password of the root account was enabled.\nOn Linux, the only way to become root is to execute a setuid-root file. When you run sudo or su, their setuid bit is set, so the process' effective user becomes root, then they do the authentiaction already as root! If it fails they exit.\nAnyway, here are the symptoms and the fix:\n$ su\nPassword:\nsu: authentication failure\n$ sudo su\n# ls -l /bin/su\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 31092 Jun  5  2012 /bin/su\n# chmod u+s /bin/su\n# ls -l /bin/su\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 31092 Jun  5  2012 /bin/su\n\nNote the difference: rwx before, rws after.\n\nA: su asks for the password of the account you're trying to login. It's usage (simplified):\nsu username\n\nWhen omitting username, the username default to root. Since the root password is disabled by default on Ubuntu, no password will be valid. The preferred way to run root commands is not through a su shell, but with sudo as in:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\n\nA: The root account in Ubuntu is disabled by default. This is to say that it has no password (which is different from it having a blank password) and no attempt to authenticate with root's password will succeed. Therefore, su or su - will not work.\nInstead, use sudo to run a command as root:\nsudo command...\nIf you want a root shell like you get with su, run:\nsudo -s\n\nIf you want a root shell like you get with su -, run:\nsudo -i\n\n\nA: su asks for the root password.\nYou can set a root password while you're root (by giving sudo su, providing that you are on the sudoers file), by giving the command passwd and setting a new password.\nThis is not recommend it for various reasons, though.\n\nA: In my case, it was because the entry for that user was missing in /etc/shadow.\nI had copied to another test server all entries in /etc/passwd with ID higher than 1000 along with /etc/group but forgot /etc/shadow. So everytime I did su with any of those users I would get that error. After adding the missing entry in /etc/shadow the error would stop appearing. \nFor example /etc/shadow:\nmyusername:*:16992:0:99999:7:::\n\n", "Q: I can't install the ndiswrapped WG311v3 drivers The instructions here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Netgear_WG311_v3 - work super well if you are using the i386 kernel, but I installed with Wubi which automatically selected the amd64 kernel even though I'm pretty sure my PC is not 64bit. \nThe thing is is that the driver will showed up as installed in my ndiswrapper -l list but sudo modprobe ndiswrapper never amounts to anything. \nIs there anything else I can try?  \n\nFixed!\nFinally got workable status using a Marvell driver from a German site! \nhttp://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/verbindungsprobleme-mit-wlan-marvel-8339-libe/#post-1888522\nThen from there all I did was:\nsudo ndiswrapper -r wg311v3\nsudo ndiswrapper -i (the Marvell.inf)\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper \n\nEt voila!\n\nA: From the solution mentioned by the original poster:\nFinally got workable status using a Marvell driver from a German site!\n\nhttp://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/verbindungsprobleme-mit-wlan-marvel-8339-libe/#post-1888522\n\nThen from there all I did was:\n\nsudo ndiswrapper -r wg311v3\nsudo ndiswrapper -i (the Marvell.inf)\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper \n\nEt voila!\n\n", "Q: Why do I have to unlock my private key to perform a download operation? I don't understand why I must be identified - anyone can download this branch. I get the same prompt when I upload to launchpad - that makes far more sense to me.\nAnyone know why bzr does this?\n\n\nA: bzr is using a ssh-key that is stored in your keyring, the calling application would actually be ssh-agent. Your keyring has a password set so that nobody else can access that key without the password. For more information on keyrings see:\nmy answer to this post\nTHe only way that i'm aware of defaulting this behavior is to generate a private/public keypair without a password.\n\nA: The location service used to resolve the lp: branch names does not distinguish between whether you want to read or write the branch. It will use the SSH transport if you've told it about your Launchpad account so that write access will work if needed. SSH connections require access to your SSH private key in order to authenticate to the server.\nAnother way to look at it is: bzr always prefers to use ssh to download branches from Launchpad, even if the branch is publicly available. (A bit like the way Launchpad always uses SSL even for public bugs.) Using SSH prevents accidental or intentional interference from other things on the network (firewalls etc) and is generally a bit faster once the connection's set up. \n", "Q: Error while configuring python in apache2 I was trying to configure python to apache2 as suggested by http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91101\n\n\n*\n\n*First downloaded and installed and enabled mod_python module\n\n*Changed /etc/apache2/sites-available/default as specified\n<Directory /var/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride AuthConfig\n    Order allow,deny\n    allow from all\n\n    AddHandler mod_python .py\n    PythonHandler mod_python.publisher\n    PythonDebug On\n\n    # Uncomment this directive is you want to see apache2's\n    # default start page (in /apache2-default) when you go to /\n    #RedirectMatch ^/$ /apache2-default/\n</Directory>\n\n\n*created test.py in my /var/www and restarted apache.\n\n*Getting 404-Not Found error for localhost/test.py\n\n*On my error.log i have\n\n[Sun Apr 10 14:07:04 2011] [notice] mod_python (pid=5591, interpreter='localhost.localdomain'): Importing module '/var/www/test.py'\n\nI am using Ubuntu-10.10.

I have this bizarre problem. whenever I  open sound preferences from indicator-sound in natty the orca speech-dispatcher runs in a terminal in a loop mode. I cannot close the terminal neither can I kill the process. I don't know what gnome-orca does except for it being a visual assistant application. Has anyone else faced this problem ??\n\n\nA: Go to System Settings then Assistive Technologies, and turn either turn it off completely, or change out orca in the Applications settings.\nIt may also work to just remove orca with  sudo apt-get remove gnome-orca .  This assumes you don't need Orca.\n\nA: I bumped into this wondering about this problem, and I solved it a different way at about the same time. This seems to happen if you disable Visual Assistance in Startup Preferences. I turned it back on and the problem went away.\n\nA: Same problem. 11.04 beta. Tried apt-get remove gnome-mag with no luck. The simple hackish answer is\nsudo mv /usr/bin/orca ~/orca\n\nwhich will stop the program from opening, leaving the executable in your home directory, should you need to mv it back.\n\nA: I've had this happen to me, the way I got around it was to uninstall gnome-orca from the Synaptic Package Manager as I saw no reason for myself to have it.  After I'd uninstalled it, I didn't encounter anymore problems.\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 13.04. \nFaced this issue. Sound was coming, even after removing orca. \nResolved by:\nGo to sound settings. Click on Applications tab and switch-off speech dispatcher.\nI hope it will help.\n", "Q: Custom daemon script: works, but does not run at boot / startup this is Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick.\nI have the following shell script in init.d that I want to run as a \"daemon\" (background service with start/stop/restart really) at system startup. There is a symlink in rc3.d. I tried 4 and 5 too. (Ideally this would initialize before graphical login happens and before a user logs in.)\nIMPORTANT: the script works 100% as expected and required when testing this with service MetaLeapDaemon start and service MetaLeapDaemon stop. (This shell script calls a Python program which makes sure the appropriate .pid files are both created at startup and deleted at exit.)\nSo generally it works fine but now my only issue is why it will not be run at any of the run-levels I tried. I know for sure it isn't run because the log file it normally creates does not get created.\nAs you can see (by the lack of any uid:gid args in the start-stop-daemon commands) this would currently run only under root, is this forbidden in a default setup?\nHere's the script, pretty much your run-off-the-mill daemon script really:\n#! /bin/sh\n\nDAEMON=/opt/metaleap/_core/daemon/MetaLeapDaemon.py\nNAME=MetaLeapDaemon\nDESC=\"MetaLeapDaemon\"\n\ntest -f $DAEMON || exit 0\n\nset -e\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start)\n        start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile /var/run/$NAME.pid --exec $DAEMON\n        ;;\n    stop)\n        start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile /var/run/$NAME.pid\n        ;;\n    restart)\n        start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile /var/run/$NAME.pid\n        sleep 1\n        start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile /var/run/$NAME.pid --exec $DAEMON\n        ;;\n    *)\n        N=/etc/init.d/$NAME\n        echo \"Usage: $N {start|stop|restart}\" >&2\n        exit 1\n        ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: I'm answering this for completeness, even though you already went with an Upstart job (and that is the way to go, I'm not suggesting here you go back)....\nI think the key thing you missed first time around was the runlevel.  I'm going to guess you are used to RPM distro's where it's typically runlevel 3 for multiuser and runlevel 5 for GUI?  \nIn Debian and Ubuntu, there's really only single user (1) and multiuser (with GUI if installed).  And multi user is runlevel 2.  So your symlinks failed because you never got to RL 3.\nUsing the update-rc.d command makes managing the symlinks easier.\nIn any case, I'm writing this up for anyone else you might actually need it.  Though I would suggest they convert the script to an Upstart too!\n\nA: Use the following command to start your script at startup.\nAdd it to the startup applications.\nsudo -u USERNAME COMMAND\n\nBy the way, someone told me to use NOPASSWORD, else it won't work:\n\nYou'd better run sudo visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file and add a NOPASSWD for the command instead of writing the password in the script. – Lekensteyn\n\nI hope this helped you,\nDaniel\n", "Q: Can I reprogram Mouse-Keys?

I used to do it with CVS+Make back in the day, it was kind of perverse i admin! :D\n\nA: I recommend using Ubuntu One for synchronizing these files.\nThere's also a guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.10/internet/C/networking-shares.html\nBut it's not possible to download this file with wget, because wget uses the http protocol to download files. If you don't have apache running on your servers, it's not possible. But, do NOT install apache just to synchronize some files!\nI hope this helped you,\nDaniel \n", "Q: Desktop feels slow: ati X600 card's fault? I am using ubuntu (well, kubuntu to be precise) and my KDE desktop feels slow. Scrolling is especially slow in kate, windows switching is slow, firefox is REALLY slow.\nI have direct rendering enabled using the r300 driver, which has been setup automatically by the installer. The computer is a bit old, but it used to be quite fast at the times I could use the proprietary ati-drivers (which dropped support for my card).\nHow can I test if there is something misconfigured? I used to use xglgears for that, but it outputs the code below:\nRunning synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be\napproximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.\n300 frames in 5.0 seconds = 59.872 FPS\n\nIs there anything I can do, or should I just change the video card? Anything you could recommend?\n\nA: In my experience, changing to raster rendering vastly improved KDE4s speed and responsiveness.  do this:\nsudo apt-get install kde-config-qt-graphicssystem\nand then find qt rendering settings in systemsettings.  Select raster and logout/back in.\n", "Q: What could I use instead of the GNOME panel applet \"Character Palette\" in unity As there is nothing like GNOME panel applets in Unity, I would like to ask about some possibility to supercede the \"Character Palette\", a function that I used a lot for comfortable embedding of special chars.\n\nA: It's very quick to load the \"Character Map\" (installed by default). \nIn the first screenshot I am loading it from the dash (click on the Ubuntu button in the top left, or press Super). For even quicker access you could add it to your Launcher on the left as seen in the second screenshot.\n\n\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to you question, but an alternative suggestion...\nI switched to using the compose key after bringing my (US keyboard) laptops to Sweden I found I had to type \"å\", \"ö\" and \"ä\" a lot, and even using the character applet was too slow.\nThere is a tutorial to enable the compose key here:\nHow to Enable Non-ASCII characters on Linux\nAnd a list of the default shortcuts here:\nLinux Compose Key Sequences\n\nA: See this answer to find out how you can make it look like Gnome top panel is a part of Unity top panel. The answer also describes how you can add Character Palette into Gnome top panel. This way, you can achieve the same functionality in Unity.\n", "Q: Problem installing Cabal-1.8.0.2 I am running Ubuntu 10.10, ghc 6.12.1, gcc 4.4.5.\nI am trying to install Nikki And The Robots.\nWhen I do cabal install it fails to install Cabal-1.8.0.2.\nCabal-1.8.0.2 already exists in ~/.cabal/lib.

I also have Jack control and Qsynth installed. When I open vmpk, I cannot hear the sound coming from it. How can I do the setting to let the sound come out?\n\nA: An alternative solution:\nIn Qsynth:\n\n\n*\n\n*List item\nMIDI tab: Enable MIDI Input box checked\nALSA Sequencer Client ID: Qsynth1\nAudio tab: Audio driver: alsa\nSoundfonts tab: SFID 1; Name /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2; Offset 0\nIn VMPK: \n-->Edit -->Connections: \"Enable Thru on MIDI Output\" checked\nInput MIDI Connection <blank>\nOutput MIDI Connection FLUID Synth (Qsynth1):0\n\n\nA: vmpk is a virtual MIDI Master keyboard, and does not produce any sound.  To generate sound, you must \n\n\n*\n\n*connect the MIDI output from vmpk to the MIDI input of some tone generator (e.g. qsynth).  If you then \n\n*connect the audio output from the tone generator to the audio input for your monitors, \n\n\nyou should hear some sounds.\nIn your specific situation, where you want to use vmpk, qsynth, and jack control, I would recommend the following procedure to generate audio based on virtual keystrokes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the \"patchage\" and \"fluid-soundfont-gm\" packages\n\n*Open Jack Control\n\n*Review JACK configuration to ensure it is attached to your preferred audio interface\n\n*Start JACK (the big play button)\n\n*Open Patchage\n\n*Open vmpk\n\n*Open Qsynth\n\n*In patchage, connect vmpk MIDI out to Qsynth MIDI in\n\n*In patchage, connect Qsynth audio out to your audio interface (both left and right channels)\n\n*In Qsynth, load a soundfont from /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2\n\n*Virtually press any key in vmpk to hear sound\n\n\nAlthough the specific tools in use differ slightly, you may find the guidance at Ubuntu Wiki helpful.  The primary difference is that you will be using a virtual keyboard rather than a physical keyboard, but patchage should not be able to tell the difference.\n\nA: vmpk produces sound by default on Ubuntu 20.04\nI don't fully understand the details, but on Ubuntu 20.04 I just get sound out of the box from vmpk (not using Qsynth and JACK).\nLikely the relevant settings which make it work by default are:\n\n*\n\n*Edit\n\n*MIDI Connections\n\n*MIDI OUT Driver: Sonivox EAS\n\n\nWorking with ALSA\nIf you want to pipe ALSA output to another synthesizer of your choice, in the MIDI Setup you can set instead:\n\n*\n\n*MIDI OUT Driver: ALSA\n\nthen I can get some sound as follows:\nsudo apt install fluidsynth\nfluidsynth -a alsa /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2\n\nThen I list all input and output alsa ports with:\naconnect -l\n\nwhich gives:\nclient 0: 'System' [type=kernel]\n    0 'Timer           '\n    1 'Announce        '\nclient 14: 'Midi Through' [type=kernel]\n    0 'Midi Through Port-0'\n        Connected From: 129:0\nclient 128: 'VMPK Input' [type=user,pid=584368]\n    0 'in              '\nclient 129: 'VMPK Output' [type=user,pid=584368]\n    0 'out             '\n        Connecting To: 14:0\nclient 130: 'FLUID Synth (586186)' [type=user,pid=586186]\n    0 'Synth input port (586186:0)'\n\nSo we connect the vmpk output to the FLUID Synth input with:\naconnect 129:0 130:0\n\nand fluidsynth starts producing some sound now as we touch the vmpk keys!\nThe sf2 instruments present by default on the VMPK GUI via Bank/Program pairs are the same as present in /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 as can be seen with:\nsf2text /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 | less\n\ne.g.:\n (0 \"Gun Shot\" (preset 127) (bank 0)\n\nQSynth setup\nGot it working too with ALSA:\nsudo apt install qsynth\nqsynth -a alsa\n\nNow in the QSynth GUI go:\n\n*\n\n*Setup\n\n*Soundfonts\n\n*Open\n\nand select /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2.\nNow aconnect works exactly as before, as qsynth must be using it on the backend.

It only shows one since this is the only one running in this workspace.\nThe terminal pip is a narrow version indicating that its running in a different workspace.  Thus you get an instant indication of BOTH applications running in the workspace as well as possible other applications running.\nIf you had two instances of firefox running in the workspace you would have two pips.\n\nTo create another instance of Firefox on another workspace, right-click and choose one of the first two options shown:\n\nTo flip between different instances, choose from the window title shown in the right-click quicklist.\n", "Q: How to make folder writable to 2 users in different groups? I have a folder (/var/www/test7.com), which must be readable/writable by www-data AND test7 users.\ntest7 user should not have access to other websites.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Create a group, put both users in this group and type:\nchown -R GROUPNAME /var/www/test7.com/*\n\nI hope this helped you,\nDaniel\n\nA: The simplest way would be to add the www-data user to the test7 group, and have the files owned by test7, not www-data.\n\nA: most confusing way would be to use 'acl' (apt-get install acl) tool to create advanced control lists, where you can allow/disallow access to files using advanced rules.\nfor example, you have directory owned by root and 3 other users, using acl you can set that direcotry owner is still root with 700 rights, but then set acl that will allow one user to read files, and other 2 read/write files in the directory.\nAll of that can be done using setfacl (to set up permissions) getfacl (to read permissions). Directories can have default settings what to assign to files/folders.\nIf not used with care you can mess up permissions pretty good.\n", "Q: Can't run xRDP, terminates unexpectedly I can't run xRDP out of the box in ubuntu 10.04.

I am currently running vnc4server successfully. \nSee my setup for Remote Desktops with VNC and RDP for more details.\n\nA: I have installed vnc4server (xvnc) and I use \"sesman-Xvnc\" as module. I am running ubuntu 10.10 however.\nNote that xrdp has to connect to a VNC server, so you have to have a vnc server installed.\n\nA: Did you grant appropriate permissions to the xrdp user that installation creates?\nsudo usermod -a -G ssl-cert xrdp\n\nInstallation creates a user. If that user lacks certificate permissions xrdp will not function. This is spelt out in just about every xrdp installation guide ever written.\nThis may or may not be your issue but it can cause the described behaviour. Put the user xrdp into the ssl-cert group with the above command. Don't forget to bounce the service.\nThe command in and of itself provides the following details:\n\n*\n\n*(sudo) admin privilege is required\n\n*(usermod) you are setting user privileges\n\n*(-a -G) you are adding the user to a group\n\n*(ss-cert) the group to which you are adding\n\n*(xrdp) the user you are adding\n\n*The name \"ssl-cert\" is pretty self-explanatory\n\nThe only thing this doesn't tell you is why and I covered that in the first sentence.

What is the best open source multimedia editing software around? An app that can convert mp3, mp4, avi, flv, etc into various formats\n\nA: Searching the Ubuntu Software Center reveals several GUI options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transmageddon - Very simple interface for individual files, supports audio and video.\n\n*OggConvert - Transcode multimedia into open formats.\n\n*Artista Transcoder - Primarily intended for transcoding videos into formats recognized by portable players (which you can select from a list).\n\n*Sound Converter - My favorite for transcoding mp3s and other audio files. Takes in whole folders, exactly what you need!\n\n\nA: ffmpeg can do pretty much any media conversion. As an example, use this to extract an MP3 from a FLV video: ffmpeg -i $1 -f mp3 -ab 128000 $2 where $1 and $2 are the source and target filenames. \nThere is also a GUI available called WinFF which reduces the amount of command-line-fu required.\n\nA: First make sure you have installed the 'restricted\" packages ( ubuntu-restricted-extras). this way you will have all the taggers, encoders and decoders on your system. Then use any of the above gui tool. Then use Sound Converter for audio and Transmaggedon fo Video.\n\nA: Apart from such programs as transmageddon, there is a python based program in development called curlew that has a simple interface, but allows you to convert between many formats using ffmpeg or libav-tools. It has been mentioned in this article recently, but some additional points need to be noted about installation, use, and removal of the tool.\nAs noted at github, there are several dependencies that need to be installed, though you will already have python and xdg-utils:\nsudo apt-get install git libavcodec-extra-53 mencoder xdg-utils python python-gobject gir1.2-gtk-3.0 ffmpeg\n\nIt supports either ffmpeg or libav-tools, so you can put either in the command above, although ffmpeg has been deprecated in favour of libav-tools in Ubuntu.\nInstallation is straightforward (the first cd is to make sure you are at the top level of your home folder):\ncd \ngit clone git://github.com/chamfay/Curlew.git\ncd Curlew\nsudo ./install\n\nYou should keep the Curlew folder, as you can uninstall it properly by running sudo ./uninstall from that folder.\nThen, just selecting curlew from the programs menu (multimedia) or entering in terminal curlew & will launch the program.\n\nAdditional Note:\nIf for any reason you have compiled ffmpeg or libav (as I have done), and now the key encoders/decoders are in the /usr/local hierarchy, you will need to run the program with a wrapper script or it will not find the libraries.\n(Only use this wrapper script if your libraries are in such a place that curlew can't find them)\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\ncurlew\nexit 0\n\n\nTo update the program: cd to the curlew folder and run sudo ./uninstall, then delete the folder, and then run the git clone command and install it again in the way shown above.\nScreenshot of the program: it is easy to select the format you require, and bitrates and other settings can be specified by clicking the advanced tab. \n\n", "Q: Today's dist-upgrade on Natty Apt resulted few erronous lines on dist-upgrade.\nPreparing to replace gir1.2-mutter-2.91 2.91.93-0ubuntu1~build1 (using .../gir1.2-mutter-2.91_3.0.0-0ubuntu1~build1_amd64.deb) ...\nUnpacking replacement gir1.2-mutter-2.91 ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/gir1.2-mutter-2.91_3.0.0-0ubuntu1~build1_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/mutter/Meta-3.0.typelib', which is also in package gir1.2-mutter-3.0 3.0.0-0ubuntu1~build2\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/gir1.2-mutter-2.91_3.0.0-0ubuntu1~build1_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nNOTE.

I just learned that some Lenovo laptops include a utility that offers to limit battery charging capacity to within 0–80% in order to slow the attenuation of the battery lifespan:\n\nHow can I do this in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I have a Asus laptop and the approach which I have found from internet is as follows. This approach may already be a part of some of the apps mentioned above but putting it here for information.\n\n*\n\n*Create a service file named battery_charge_threshold.service like this.\n[Unit]\nDescription=Set the battery charge threshold\nAfter=multi-user.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo 80 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold'\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n\n\n*Move the file to this location /etc/systemd/system\n\n*Run the following commands.\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/battery-charge-threshold.service\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable battery-charge-threshold.service\n\nAfter doing this, charge threshold of 80% (as per service file) will persist between reboots. It will also stop charging the battery if the current level is above 80%.\nHope this helps. I have been using it for almost 1.5 years without any issue.\n\nA: Did you check to see whether there is a BIOS setting on your laptop for this? My laptop had a Windows Application as well as a \"Battery Life Extender\" setting in the BIOS for this exact feature.\n\nA: There's a somewhat nicer application now available to Ubuntu (and other distributions):\n\nTLP – Linux Advanced Power Management\nTLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux\nwithout the need to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with\na default configuration already optimized for battery life, so you may\njust install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to\nfulfil your specific requirements.\n\nOne of the parameters it controls is maintaining battery charging limits. As pointed by @tanius in the comments (please upvote them!), while TLP used to only work on Thinkpads, the newest version has support for devices from multiple vendors, and given the nature of the project—if the appropriate drivers for other devices will become available, it is likely these will get integrated into this project too. So if you're reading this comment in few years, check the documentation, maybe your device is now supported.\nUbuntu packages are available in the official repository.\n\nA: On my Dell XPS, I installed the smbios-utils package using sudo apt install smbios-utils. This package provides a command called smbios-battery-ctl. It looks like battery level based charge control has been available since Ubuntu 20.04. Full details are in the manpage, but for a basic 80% setting, I think this will work:\nsudo smbios-battery-ctl --set-custom-charge-interval 75 80\nsudo smbios-battery-ctl --set-charging-mode=custom\n\nThis will start charging when the battery falls below 75%, and stop charging when it reaches 80%.\nTo change the setting back:\nsudo smbios-battery-ctl --set-charging-mode=adaptive\n\n\nA: I wrote a command line application that does this.\nThe easiest way to get started is download the app from the releases page and run\n$ ./bat --help\n\nfrom the terminal in the directory where it is located which should show the help documentation.\nIf there's an error, it might have to do with permissions. The following command might solve the problem.\nchmod +x ./bat\n\nBasically, running\n$ ./bat --threshold\n\nwill print out the current threshold.\nTo set a new threshold, say 60%, run\n./bat --threshold 60\n\nTo persist the current threshold between restarts, run\nsudo ./bat --persist\n\nNote: Persisting uses systemd under the hood but this is bundled with most Linux distributions including Ubuntu.\nTip: Putting the app in a directory like /usr/local/bin/ that is in the $PATH will enable you to run it from anywhere and not just in the directory the app is in. Then the above commands become,\nbat --help\n\nbat --threshold 60\n\nbat --persist\n\nrespectively.\n\nA: There is a hardware hack I just discovered for Dell laptops:\nDell chargers use 3 pins, one for (+), one for (-) and one for Dell Charger Identification Communication (a 1-Wire protocol). This communication line is usually the one in the center of connector, the needle like pin.\nIf you cut this communication line, laptop will continue running from AC but the battery won't be charged anymore.\nLocate the communication line, cut it, place a switch in between. Charge your laptop's battery as much as you want and then turn off that switch. Your laptop will use AC but your battery will stay put at the charge you left it.\nSee this answer for recommended charge levels for various scenarios: https://superuser.com/a/664583/187576\nEdit\nApperently a disadvantage of this approach is that the laptop degrades its performance if no identified charger found.\nThis might not be an issue for normal usage, however, if you need your CPU power for like 3D design, the performance is degraded noticeably.\n\nA: The accepted answer does not work on my new Lenovo T440s. Apparently the firmware changed. Following http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tpacpi-bat, I did\ngit clone https://github.com/teleshoes/tpacpi-bat.git\ncd tpacpi-bat/\n./install.pl\nsudo ./tpacpi-bat -s ST 1 15 # load internal battery when below 15%\nsudo ./tpacpi-bat -s SP 1 95 # stop charging at 95%\nsudo ./tpacpi-bat -g ST 2 # when is external battery loaded?\n\nFor reference, I did this on debian testing but I'm sure it works in ubuntu just as well.\n\nA: On my Toshiba R830 running Windows 8.1, I installed the Toshiba Power Saver application in order to limit the battery charge to 80%\nWhen I boot on Linux (Ubuntu, Mint, etc), the maximum charge is still limited to 80%.\nTherefore, the Toshiba Power Saver seems to store its configuration into the bios.\nThe only drawback is that if I want to travel with a fully charged battery, I have to reboot on Windows and change the Power Saver configuration.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install TLP:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install tlp\n\n# Check what package needed for battery:\nsudo tlp-stat -b\n\n# If acpi_call is recommended\nsudo apt install acpi-call-dkms\n\n# If smapi is recommended\nsudo apt install tp-smapi-dkms\n\n\n\n*Open config file of TLP\nsudo gedit /etc/tlp.conf\n\n\n\n*Find the lines regarding battery settings, remove the leading # for comment and maybe insert the value you want\nSTART_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=75\nSTOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=80\n\n\n\n*Restart tlp\nsudo tlp start\n\n\n\n*Check the config status\nsudo tlp-stat -b\n\n\nA: The charging thresholds are, very unfortunately, firmware and vendor specific.\nThe Lenovo ThinkPad user is luckily provided with a solution outlined on ThinkWiki.\nIt basically says that you would have to install and load the tp_smapi kernel module:\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms\nsudo modprobe tp_smapi\n\nand write the desired charging thresholds to virtual files in /sys/devices/platform/smapi:\necho 40 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh\necho 80 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh\n\nThen it will stop charging once it reached 80% and only start charging when it drops below 40%.\nToshiba and others might have a similar kernel module that exposes firmware functionality to the /sys or /proc space, but it is very unlikely for patent issues. For the same reasons, an application that could handle this would be either Thinkpad- specific or only address a few select vendors.\n\nA: Very often (almost always) this is an option in the BIOS that Windows can change remotely. It's very difficult to remote change this in Linux. My suggestion? When starting up your computer, smash the function keys, specifically F1, F2, F3, F6, F8, F10, and F12. One of these (maybe another) will put you into the bios menu. It says which key on startup, but it doesn't usually stay up long enough. \nLook for power settings (only arrow keys here, no mouse). Find batter saver or batter optimizer or something along those lines. Change that to enabled, and then save and restart. This should do it. \nLinux tends to freak out when the battery doesn't charge past 80%, but it will just ruin your expected charge times. Nothing to worry about here. \nStill need help? Comment your question! Did I help? +1 me :)\n\nA: For LG Gram laptops, there's a specific kernel driver, which seems to be active out of the box, at least in EndeavourOS, for particular features of LG Gram, see https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/laptops/lg-laptop.html\nIn particular, it also provides a \"Battery care limit\". Quoting from that page:\n\nWriting 80/100 to /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/battery_care_limit sets the maximum capacity to charge the battery. Limiting the charge reduces battery capacity loss over time.\n\n\nThis value is reset to 100 when the kernel boots.\n\nSo, for example, you can manually set the limit to 80 with the following command:\necho '80' | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/battery_care_limit\n\nI tested that on my LG Gram 16, and it seems to work perfectly: when plugging the AC with 85% charged, KDE states that it is charging, but the percentage stays at 85% (with \"time to full\" blocked at 1:41).\nAs stated in the quote above, this value will be reset when the kernel boots, so you may have to change the value again.\nI guess that for a more automatic solution, tlp provides support for that as well, https://gist.github.com/linrunner/fee8feeb079efc03001d9f3671146298\n\nA: On my asus laptop\nsudo -i eval \"echo 60 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold\"\n\nIf /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold isn't there, it is more likely your laptop doesn't support it.\nThis value get reset every time you reboot your laptop. You can configure a cron job or a systemd service to set it back.

But here is the catch: File Roller does not know that 7z supports WIM. So the trick consists in \"fooling\" File Roller to think WIM files are actually 7z. Sure, renaming (or appending) WIM filenames with \".7z\" extension works. But it can be more elegant than that.\nIve downloaded and and examined File Roller's source code, and found out that it (thankfully) detects files by mime types, not filenames.\nSo the complete solution could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have p7zip package installed.

I've read a lot of discussion about a new Ubuntu configuration tool: gconf is replaced by dconf.\nWhy is this change being made? Why is there so much debate about it? Is it too difficult to create a gconf2dconf migration tool?\n\nA: gconf typically uses an XML backend, while dconf uses its own binary blob. From that change alone you can draw up some points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Binary read access is far faster than parsing XML\n\n*According to dconf's design section, a Gnome login consists of thousands of read operations and only a few writes. To gconf that's thousands of stats, thousands of reads and thousands of parsings. dconf's binary blob would blitz through those without bogging the system down with umpteen thousand IOPs.\n\n*XML is more portable\n\n*XML is largely human -readable and -editable.\n\n*A file-based system can be separated and portioned without much hassle\n\n*Corruption of a monolith binary file could mean the whole thing dies. Single file corruption only hurts that segment in gconf.\n\n\nA lot of the arguments are those levelled for and against the Windows registry.\nAs I understand it, the interface onto this settings back-end would be the same as gconf: through GSettings. This would allow distributions and users to chose one and switch out if they needed to.\n", "Q: Will there be some kind of widgets for Unity ?

Both my laptop and my home machine are ubuntu boxes.\nI'm thinking, http server on home machine, program on laptop catching all attempts to contact the network, encrypting them, and forwarding over http to the home machine, which then goes and does its thing over its clear internet connection, and sends the results back. \nThen wherever I can get http over port 80 to home, I have proper access.\nIs there an easy way to do it?

It should allow you to ssh to your machine at home as long as they don't actually inspect the packages to only allow https traffic.\nIt's quite easy. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and append Port 443 on a new line after Port 22:\n# Package generated configuration file\n# See the sshd_config(5) manpage for details\n\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\nPort 22\nPort 443\n# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to\n#ListenAddress ::\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\n\nRestart the ssh daemon with sudo service ssh restart, and netstat --listening should show that a process is listening for https connections.\nIf it works, you can tunnel all your traffic through your home machine to access github etc. You could set up a proper vpn, or use try using an easier approach such as sshuttle, that only require a program on the client and standard ssh setup on the server.\n", "Q: Error message in Update Manager \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I remove a malformed line from my sources.list?\nHow do I fix “malformed line” errors in sources.list? \n\nI am getting an error message when I run the Update Manager:\nE:Malformed line 59 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)\n\nAny ideas on how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: I also had the same error and had to remove the line 59 and 60 to solve the problem.

I want to use the HDMI port to play PS3 as if the laptop was a screen.\nNote: I don't want any kind of PS3 emulator or that sort of things.\nThank you.\n\nA: I would love to be proven wrong, because it would be frickin sweet to use your laptop to display game console output. But. The HDMI port is an output. All it does is send stuff from the graphics card to whatever is plugged into it. Same thing goes for the PS3. If you plug your PS3 into it, they're just gonna sit there sending output signals at each other.\nCheck out the specs for your card. I don't see anything about it having an input port.\nWhat MAY be possible, and lofi, is installing a TV tuner card to your computer and using the antenna input on the TV tuner card to take the coax output from your PS3.\n\nA: As far as I know this is not possible. The HMDI port on your laptop is most likely an output only port and so as such you can't pipe your PS3 output through it and onto your laptop screen. You can only use it to attach a HDMI enabled display to your laptop as an extra screen. Sorry.\n\nA: You can't do that, since the HDMI ports of laptops are for OUTPUT only, and you want to use it as INPUT.\nThat would only be achieavable using an add-on video input card, impossible to install in a laptop.\n", "Q: Can't get usbmon to work I'm trying to use usbmon but modprobe usbmon does not work.\nThe error is  \n\nFATAL: Module usbmon not found\n\nI'm using kernel version 2.6.31-23-generic-pae do I need to recompile the kernel? Is there another way to monitor usb traffic?\nAlso is there a known bug in usb driver?  At the app level I at times fail to receive a packet. I am using libusb 1.0 and it's not reporting any errors.\n\nA: The stock kernel is configured with CONFIG_USB_MON=y, which means that it's a built-in feature, so you don't need to load any module before using the usbmon functionality.\n", "Q: What do I have to do before giving away my Ubuntu machine? I have an old laptop that is running Ubuntu. Now I want to give away this laptop, but I want to remove all private data. So what should I remove? I don't want to format the whole system, because the OS will be still in use by the new owner.\n\nA: In complement to very good advice already given:\nIf you have been running local servers for development purposes, such as apache2, mysql, etc. I would advise to remove them using the \"purge\" option (it destroys conf files), be sure to remove the data and log directories and files (such as found in /var/log/ and /var/www/ or /var/lib/xxxx/ by default but in other places of your choice in you made a custom config) and then reinstall them with their default settings if needed by the new user.\nAnother advice for paranoid/clean people is to regenerate a new ssh server host key for the machine.\nrm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*\ndpkg-reconfigure openssh-server\n\nso that it is no more considered as a known host by others.\n\nA: You normally have all your private data in /home, especially browser cache and so on.\nYou might have private internet-settings in /etc/Network-Manager. Visit /etc, and look into the directories. Reconfigure your things, delete private data (WLAN key), see if everything is vanished. If not, remove by hand. mc (midnight commander) is a useful tool to iterate through directories, to view and delete files. (shred, see bottom).\nAnother directory with private Data might be /var/spool or /var/cache. For example the cups-printer-spooler produces summaries of printjobs, and document name, date of job can be reconstructed. Maybe you wish to clean them too.\nThose files in /tmp get automatically deleted on every startup. So if you didn't reorganized things, which only you may know,\n\n*\n\n*create a fresh new account without password for the new user, (who is prompted for a password on the first login) and give this user the right to become superuser. Issue a groups command at your own profile, to copy useful privileges like lpadmin, plugdev, scanner, ... before deletion.\n\n*login with the recover-option to get root access, and\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /home/roflcoptr\n\n*find . -delete # or, instead of -delete, you might consider shred:\n\n*find . -execdir shred -n 1 {} +\n\n*control with ls\n\n*delete your normal account (see: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) (suggested from the comments, thanks @intuited, give him a star)\n\nIf you consider cleaning empty space (@intuiteds second advice, maybe we should donate a star?), It would be more easy to use a live-cd to shred the whole system (which can continue unattended) and then install a new one (needs about 25 minutes with few interactions, mostly in the beginning). This could be in general the faster solution.\nMore than one shred iteration is nonsense.\n\nA: Run Bleachbit.\nhttp://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/\nThis way you may choose exactly what you want to remove without using some complicated command lines.\n\nA: I personally use any method methods to wipe the drive\n# from a live CD\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=iM\n\nOr DBAN or scrub (again from a live CD)\nsudo apt-get install scrub\nsudo scrub -p dod -f  /dev/sda\n\nhttp://www.dban.org/\nYou can the do an OEM install\nHow do I pre-install Ubuntu for someone (OEM install)?\n\nA: If the data is not very important, you can create a new user and delete the old one.\n\nA: Your safest option is to use something like DBAN to securely wipe the disk and then reinstall from scratch.\nIf you want to provide the same application profile to the recipient, you can use dpkg --get-selections to dump the system package state before wiping, and then use dpkg --set-selections after reinstallation to tell the new system that you want those packages installed.  This will allow you to conveniently reinstall all the apps that you had set up.\nThe tool aptitude-create-state-bundle can also be used for this purpose, and is likely preferable, since it works at a higher level and can remember what packages were explicitly installed by you.\n\nA: In my opinion, doing a complete disk wipe and reinstall of the OS is easier, less time-consuming, and more likely to erase everything that you wanted to erase. True, wiping the whole disk will take a long time, but you can go do something else while you wait. Removing specific packages and files from the existing OS is an involved process that requires lots of thinking and leaves lots of room for error. A complete reinstall accomplishes the same thing, only more effectively and with less work on your part.\n\nA: There are varying levels of security. Personally, I play it a little more paranoid. I wouldn't give away a hard drive if I've stored sensitive info on it. It might be worth it to you to just buy a new hard drive and install Ubuntu on it for whoever you're giving this to.\nIf you aren't this paranoid, or your data isn't that sensitive, see user unknown's post.\n\nA: Very old question i know. Most of us have spare disks knocking about from old systems and even if you don't they are cheap enough now that you could easily just buy a new one and replace the existing disk in the laptop/computer.\nAll you need to do then is install the operating system via OEM install option and the new owner sets up their own account on first login, plenty of answers on that right here on askubuntu so I won't rehash that.\nSimply put, you keep/destroy your disk that might contain sensitive information and put another disk in.\n", "Q: Nautilus \"locks up\" when browsing directories with version control, many files When opening a directory that is version controlled, especially one with subdirectories containing hundreds or thousands of individual files, Nautilus temporarily freezes (application does not respond to user input). A similar behavior applies to directories with hundreds or thousands of individual files. These freezes can last several minutes, during which CPU load barely climbs (2 - 4% above normal) but hard disk access is significant. \nAn example is a version controlled directory, with the complete Boost library source and GNU Science library source, both untarred, and the entire source tree of a hydrology model.\nIs there a way to reduce or eliminate this problem? (Version control is critical and can't be altered; some file re-organization can be done for badly affected directories) \nNOTE: This affects both 10.04 LTS (32-bit PAE) and 10.10 (64-bit). The lucid machine has a Core i7 (2.8GHz), 6GB RAM, and 1TB HDD with a 32MB cache. The maverick machine has a Core i5 (2.43GHz), 4GB RAM, and a 500GB HDD (unknown cache size). Both HDDs are 7200 RPM drives.\n\nA: One way to at least reduce the number of io operations is to disable (some of) the preview features in Nautilus. Open the Preview tab in File Management Preferences by clicking on Edit->Preferences. The previews works great for a limited amount of files, but it doesn't scale that well.\nI reckon Count number of items: might be the culprit in your case, as it will go through all the directories with hundreds or thousands of files and count them all. Similarly, previewing text files will be heavy with thousands of them and so forth.\n\n", "Q: Permanently set process limit How do you permanently set process limit per user (ulimit -u) in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and configure nprocs appropriately. \nYou may need to add pam_limits to your pam configuration.  The default configuration has pam_limits configured for many services.   You may want to add pam_limits to /etc/pam.d/common-session. \n\nA: Edit /etc/security/limits.conf, making changes per the examples and for the limits you want.  \nYou'll also need to add a line to the /etc/pam.d/common-session file:\nsession required pam_limits.so\n\nThe change to PAM modules may be necessary elsewhere, but generally, common-session is included related configurations, e.g., \n$ grep common-session /etc/pam.d/sshd :     \n\n   sshd:@include common-session\n\n", "Q: How to update Ubuntu from Windows in a dual boot setup without booting into it Is it possible to update Ubuntu in a dual boot setup with Windows 7, without booting into Ubuntu?\n\nA: Not easily, ubuntu is probably installed on an ext3 (or 4) partition and windows can't read that file system without installing some exotic extras, which I've heard don't work very well.\nYou might be able to do something if you installed Ubuntu via wubi but I don't think it currently has the ability to update yet, only install and uninstall.\nThe best solution might be to boot into Ubuntu and update it that way, or not update it. If you have no intention of ever booting into ubuntu, then why would you need to update it?\n", "Q: How well does the Macbook Air work with Ubuntu? I'm thinking of getting a nice laptop [thin like Macbook Air, Actually I'm thinking of getting Macbook Air itself]. Question is, how well it will go with Ubuntu.\nBeing ubuntu user for last 7 years, I cant think of moving away just for great hardware capabilities in AirBook. However, It would be great if Ubuntu 11.04 runs on Airbook smoothly without much of messy. \nI would wish to have all Ubuntu 11.04 features to work with Macbook Air.[Video/Audio, Keyboard, Touchpad, etc]. Is there users out here tried and would recommend Macbook Air ?. Any good guide would help as well. \n\nA: There is a good discussion on the Apple Users section of ubuntuforums which is definitely worth a read through and contains probably the most up to date guide and experiences which others have had. You could also look at:\nhttp://ebsi4711.blogspot.com/2010/10/ubuntu-on-macbookair31-11.html\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu on a Macbook Air 4,2 (mid 2011), and I'm not sure I'd do it again (buying an Air, despite the nice hardware). Setting up any Linux on an Air is really much hassle, since it cannot boot Linux off an USB stick (mac firmware problems).\nIf you have an official apple superdrive, using the install CD is supposed to work nice, but without it's too much pain.\n\nSee http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/ubuntu-on-macbook-air.htm for an installation howto and a hardware support table for Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: Install rEfit. Its a handy boot manager that allows you to boot from a usb thumb drive. MAke your ubuntu installation drive as you can see on the ubuntu download site.

Currently using MyWi app I'm trying to share my iPhone's 3G data connection with my Ubuntu desktop as my broadband router has blown up (a new one is on order...). \nI have successfully managed to share my 3G data connection with my Win 7 OS on the same desktop machine, but I'd really like to get it working in Ubuntu, as Win 7 is a real step back for me. On Win 7 I was able to share my mobile data connection by installing the iOS MyWi app on my iPhone and connecting over USB. I tried to share my 3G connection via USB and use the native iOS 'Internet Tethering' feature but Win 7 could not discover the connection.\nOn Ubuntu I've tried using the MyWi app to share my 3G connection to my Ubuntu desktop via USB but Ubuntu simply cannot 'discover' the network. I also tried to set my iPhone to 'Internet Tethering ON' and manually adding my mobile connection in Ubuntu as a 'Mobile Broadband' and adding the APN for 3UK.

This is of course a suboptimal, but it worked for me. I tried some other ways to define the connection, but didn't find a GUI-solution and got used to that method.\nMake sure you have libimobiledevice -installed. For diagnosing it was useful to keep an eye on system logs, via command tail -f /var/log/messages or the Gnome Log File Viewer while connecting the iPhone USB cable.\n\nA: go to system > preferences > network connections and create a mobile broadband connection.\n", "Q: How can I reduce or increase the number of workspaces in Unity? I was reading about how to get multiple workspaces in the mutter version of Unity, however since Compiz is replacing Mutter how do I go about adding and removing workspaces in Compiz version of Unity?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 CLI:\ndconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/hsize\ndconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/vsize\n\nWrite:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/hsize 2\n\n\nA: 11.10 and below\nUsing CCSM\nThis works on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as well, but it is easier and safer to use MyUnity instead.\n\nWarning: ccsm can lead to unwanted effects that may be hard to overcome and may leave you without a desktop (see also this question for more background information).\n\nThe options for the number of workspaces can be found in compizconfig-settings-manager  under General Options. Do not set horizontal workspaces below 2 or the workspace switcher button won't work.\n\n\nUsing MyUnity\nMyUnity can be used also in 11.10 and below, with additional steps.\nIn a terminal, use sudo add-apt-repository ppa:myunity/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install myunity to install MyUnity. Then, use the steps described above to 12.04.\n\nA: You could also use the newly created quicklist from me, which can be found here: \nQuicklist to Add/Remove workspaces rows/columns\n\nA: You can open a terminal and set as you want.  \nWith this command you set the number of horizontal viewports (at this example I am changing it to \"3\"):  \ngconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/hsize 3  \n\nAnd with this you set the number of vertical viewports (at this example I am changing it to \"4\"):  \ngconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/vsize 4\n\n\nA: 12.10\nMyUnity has been removed from the quantal repositories pending a rewrite.  It may make a reappearance at a later date.\nUntil then, the number of workspaces can be changed using one of four methods:\n\n*\n\n*via the command-line\n\n*using Ubuntu-Tweak\n\n*using compiz-settings-manager (Not Recommended - use the CCSM answer if you wish to risk this route).\n\n*dconf-editor\nmethod 1\nIf you love the terminal you can achieve the above via:\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ hsize [x]\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ vsize [y]\n\nwhere [x] and [y] are numeric values\nmethod 2\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu-Tweak?\nmethod 3\ndconf-tools \nIMPORTANT NOTE: you must have used method one or two previously for dconf-editor to show the keys to change.\nThe reason for this is because dconf-editor does not show relocatable schema keys by default unless they have been previously changed.\nFirst install dconf-tools.\nThen press ALT+F2 and type dconf-editor\n\nPress Enter or click on the icon shown.\nThis then opens the application:\n\nNavigate down the tree to org - compiz - profiles - unity - plugins - core and change the values shown.\n\nA: Install compizconfig-settings-manager, launch it through System Settings (in the Personal section), then go to General Options (in the General Section), now in the tab Desktop Size you can change the number of vertical or horizontal desktops.\n\nA: You could try with ccsm or myunity.\nccsm (CompizConfig Settings Manager)\n\nOpen a terminal and run:\ngksudo apt-get install ccsm\n\nenter your password and enter y when asked.\nNow press ALT and F2 together, type ccsm and press Enter.\nWhen CompizConfig Settings Manager appears, select Desktop Wall.\nMyUnity\n\nWith MyUnity you can set the number of desktops, but nothing more.\nOpen a terminal and run:\ngksudo apt-get install myunity\n\nenter your password and enter y when asked.\nNow press ALT and F2 together, type myunity and press Enter.\nWhen MyUnity appears, select desktop. Change H Desktop for horizontal desktops and V Desktop for vertical desktops.\n\nA: 15.04 and later\nOn later versions of Ubuntu Workspaces are in the Workspace switcher. The number of desktops can be modified by installing the CompizConfig Settings Manager and changing the numbers listed under \"General Options > Desktop Size\".\n13.04 -14.10\nWorkspaces are by default disabled on a new install of Ubuntu v13.04.\nYou can toggle workspaces on/off as well as defining the number of workspaces through unity-tweak-tool  (sudo apt install unity-tweak-tool)\n\n\n12.04 \nThe number of workspaces can be safely set without using CCSM through MyUnity\n\nMove the slide-bars to change the number of horizontal & vertical workspaces\nfor example 4x1\n\n\nA: Actually, you can change desktops without using either ccsm or MyUnity.  I have a script to add o remove rows and columns, but you can create a simple alias to set either one.\nFor example to set the number of columns, enter this at a bash prompt:\ngconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/hsize Num_of_Cols, where \"Num_of_Cols\" is a number for the horizontal size, or number of columns.\nFor the number of rows, use vsize instead of hsize.\nI originally got the script from this askubuntu article, about adding the options as quicklists to the unity launcher, but it works as a script in any menu, or as a bash function or alias.\n\nA: I used CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM). Open CCSM, select General Options then go to the Desktop Size tab.\nYou can adjust the number and the layout of the workspaces by using the Horizontal Virtual Size and Vertical Virtual Size sliders to adjust the number of \"columns\" and \"rows\" respectively.\nUsing this method does not appear to change the settings mentioned above in gconf editor.\n", "Q: Sound is played in a loop without mouse or keyboard activity I have a weird problem with my linux.\nif I run a mp3-file with the rhythm box or \nalso run a video in youtube that results \nin that if I do not move my mouse or touch the keyboard for about 3 seconds,\nthe sound is played in a loop (the 2 last seconds keep repeating).\n(In the case of youtube also the video stops in the meanwhile)\nAfter touching the keyboard/mouse it repeats until nothing is pressed for around 3\nseconds again!\nSomebody knows this problem or a solution?\nMy distribution is Ubuntu 10.10 which uses pulseaudio.\nI can kill it, but just by restarting it I get the same problem,\nDo I need a different driver?\n\nA: I agree with Overbose this isn't really a programming question, but if you're using a distribution that uses pulseaudio, try killing it and restarting it  using \"pulseaudio -k\" and \"pulseaudio --check\".\n", "Q: Path not setting up for a setup I am unable to add path of my omnet bin directory for the installation.\nDuring the installation i go to the omnet directory and enter ./configure which gives me the following errors \nWARNING: your PATH doesn't contain /home/ABC/Desktop/omnetpp-4.1/bin!\nAdd the following line to your .profile or .bash_profile (provided you use bash):\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/ABC/Desktop/omnetpp-4.1/bin\n\n\nWARNING: The TCL_LIBRARY environment variable is not set, and without it\nTkenv (the GUI runtime environment) may be unable to find the BLT library.\n\nAdd the following line to your .profile or .bash_profile (provided you use bash):\nexport TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.4\n\nSo i do the exact thing ... go to the profile file ~/.profile and it now looks like this \n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n     # include .bashrc if it exists\n     if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n     . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n     fi\nfi\n\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/ABC/Desktop/omnetpp-4.1/bin\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n    export TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.4\n\nfi\n\nBut still the error persists.

How can I clear the recently used and viewed files without using terminal?\n\nA: The only way I know how to do this is to install Ubuntu Tweak, which can be found by going to http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ and installing the software.\nOpen Ubuntu Tweak up and go to Gnome Settings then uncheck Enable System Wide \"Recent Documents\" List\n\nA: You can use bleachbit from its homepage on SourceForge or install it through the Software Center.\nIt can delete all unnecessary files, and system cache.\nOpen BleachBit and then check your preferences:\nfor deleting recent documents, only select System→recent documents \n\nA: Upgrade to 12.04. It comes with a cleaner and settings wizard by default.\nUnder System Settings click Privacy, there is an option to clear the recent history.\n\nA: It depends on whether you're using Unity or the Classic desktop. \nIn Unity, the recent documents that you see in the Files lens are logged using Zeitgeist. If you don't want to use the terminal to remove these, or only want to remove a few of them, the best thing to do is install \"Activity Journal\" using the Software Center. Fire up the Activity Journal, and you'll see all your recently used apps and documents, grouped by day. If you right click a document and click \"Delete item from Journal\", Zeitgeist will forget that you used that document at that specific time. If you click \"Delete all items with this URL\", Zeitgeist will forget you ever used that document. If you want to delete everything, this terminal command (which others have already posted) will do the job:\nrm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\n\nThere's a Zeitgeist Global Privacy app in development which will make this easier, but unfortunately it's not released yet. \nThe Classic desktop (and the lists of recently used files in most applications' File menus) stores a record of your recently used documents in ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel.

I've got some games running in Wine, but I can't figure out how to change the keyboard layout.  By default, I use the dvorak layout in Ubuntu, which isn't very friendly for most games.  I can change it back to QWERTY in Ubuntu, but when I fire up a game, it stays with my default dvorak.  How can I change to QWERTY inside my wine application?\n\nA: A lot of wine programs use the X keyboard layout instead of the window manager's layout. You have to change it by running\nsetxkbmap us\n\nThen change back with\nsetxkbmap us dvorak\n\n\nA: In case someone has multiple keyboard layouts - this solution worked for me.\nI have two keyboard layouts: English (us) and Ukrainian (uk). The first one was set as default in system settings. However, in Wine games the letter keys (q,w,e,r,t,y,etc.) didn't work at all.\nBased on Alex's answer, I found the way to determine my current X keyboard layout settings:\nsetxkbmap -v\n\nIt showed me the following:\nTrying to build keymap using the following components:\nkeycodes:   evdev+aliases(qwerty)\ntypes:      complete+numpad(microsoft)\ncompat:     complete\nsymbols:    pc+ua+us:2+inet(evdev)+group(alt_shift_toggle)\ngeometry:   pc(pc101)\n\nI noticed that the symbols line has ua (not us) on the first place. Assuming that Wine always uses the first specified layout, I just needed to change the layout precedence:\nsetxkbmap us,ua\n\nAnd it worked. However, after reboot it was reset back to its default state. Thus, I have to do it each time after boot. I'll try to find a way to store those settings by default.\n\nA: Who use different keyboard layouts just need open settings on ubuntu -> language settings and plase English layout top on list. P.S. I'm sorry, I did it on gui, dont know terminal command ;-)\n\nA: In the keyboard control panel, you can configure multiple keyboard layouts from the Layouts tab.  Click on Options... and expand the Key(s) to change layout section.  Pick the key combo you prefer and you should have an easy way to switch layouts.\nIf the Separate layout for each window checkbox is checked in the main keyboard control panel, then each window should remember which layout they are using separately rather than it being a global setting.\n", "Q: How does the Ubuntu upgrade process work? How does Ubuntu upgrade seamlessly to a newer distribution, while the operating system is still running? I'm upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04, and I've upgraded several times before, and it's as simple as running update-manager -d and downloading and installing them, then rebooting. \nHow exactly does this work though? How is the upgrade manager able to update the operating system while it is still in use?\n\nA: From my experience I would assume that while packages and modules are running they are held in memory and don't refer back to their copy on the hard drive much. You can see this if you run a program in ubuntu and then remove the related packages while its running. It will keep running, but if you close it, you can't restart it.\nI would assume the same happens with a distribution upgrade. All of the packages related to the original version of ubuntu are still running even though they have been removed and replace with the new ones, so when they are finally stopped on a system restart, the new packages take over.\n\nA: At the filesystem level, unlike Windows, on a Unix system you can delete files that are open.  Deletion just removes the name of the file, not its contents, so any programs that still have the file open can still access it until they close the file, and only then is the data freed.\nSo the upgrade process simply removes the old files, replaces them with the new ones, and for certain system services, restarts them so the new version is running.\nThere are one or two components that can not be restarted without rebooting the whole computer, so after upgrading those, you get prompted to reboot so you will be using the new version.\n\nA: How can Linux update itself while it's still in use?\nMainly because Linux (and with it, most distributions) is simply designed that way.  Being able to upgrade a package on a running system is a goal for most Linux based distributions.\nWith Linux, there is nothing that would prevent the package manager process from writing to a file on disk, even if that file is currently open by an application or the file is an executable or shared library of code that is currently running.  On a very low-level, there are locks that protect access to a file during a single write/read operation, but these are never designed to be held for more than a matter of milliseconds and any other application trying to write to the same file will simply wait those milliseconds.\nYou can replace an executable file while it's running and it won't actually do anything to the running process, because the process no longer needs the file on disk - all of its code has already been loaded into memory.\nThat is why on Linux, even though you can upgrade an application while it's running, the upgrade won't actually take effect until the application you upgraded is restarted.  In the case of upgrading a background process such as a system service, that service would need to be restarted.  In the case that you've upgraded the kernel, then this means a reboot.\nWon't replacing a program's files while it's running break some programs?\nSome of the packages in a Linux distribution will contain installation instructions instructing the package manager to stop certain system services while the package updates, and re-start those services after the update is complete.  This prevents situations where, for example, the configuration files for a particular service are updated and the running version of the service may not be able to cope with the newer version of the configuration files.\nIn general, regular user applications require no configuration files to run, except for files it generates itself and places in locations such as the users' home directories.  So these won't be touched by the package manager when updating.\n\nA: Here a more detailed description of the process. Sorry the text got so long.\nMy experience stems from Debian, for which the entire packaging and upgrade system used in Ubuntu was originally invented. The daily Ubuntu security upgrades correspond to running apt-get upgrade which normally doesn't remove any software. The big release upgrades correspond to a apt-get dist-upgrade during which software packages can be exchanged completely.\nActually the very low level components are normally not exchanged during a release upgrade. Immediately after the upgrade you should find two kernel and initrd images in your /boot directory. This is because unlike programs kernel components are not interchangable so well. If the need arises to load new device drivers during the upgrade, those must be compatible with the running kernel. After the system boots up with the new kernel, the old one can be removed. Last time I checked this one thing had to be done manually, I don't know how the current updater handles this. This is BTW. the main reason, why the kernel image bears its version number in the file name - so you can have different kernel versions installed at the same time. Same for the module path (/lib/modules/...)\nSoftware packages are upgraded one by one, starting with the lowest packages in the dependency hirarchy. Those are normally program librarys like libc and other ones. The sequence in which packages are updated is however not hardcoded but dynamically calculated as package dependencies are resolved. In most cases old programs can function with new librarys, so it's not so problematic if those librarys get replaced first.\nYou have to understand here, that the system differentiates between manually installed packages (i.e. the packages which installation you directly requested yourself, i.e. chromium) and automatically installed packages, which where only installed to fulfill dependencies of manually installed packages (and dependencies of those dependencies).\nFor each manually installed program, the updater just looks for a newer version. Often those programs are just meta packages like \"ubuntu-desktop\", which contains no data, and just dependencies. New versions of dependent libraries will be pulled in, as they are requested by directly updated (manually requested) programs. The updater will always try to install the newest usable version of any dependent package (during any upgrdade not just release upgrades).\nPrograms which cannot function with the new library versions cannot be started during the time after the library is upgraded, and before the program itself is upgraded as well. If those programs should already be running before the library upgrade they will however continue to run, because the old library version remains in memory as long as it remains in use. Same goes for programs which were started before they get upgraded. Those will not provide new features until they are terminated and restarted.\nAfter the update some libraries (or dependencies in general) will be orphaned. Those are libraries which were required by old program versions, but are no longer required by the new versions. Since these packages are marked as automatically installed, and since no manually installed prgram relates to them anymore these packages can easily be located and removed. You can even observe this as the last step of the update process (the updater sais \"removing obsolete packages\" or something similar).\nSome packages will be installed, which where not installed before, those are simply new dependencies, which are marked as automatically installed, and can be removed, should the requirement for them vanish in the future.\nThis mechanism even allows the exchange of entire user programs. Like for example switching from Gnome2 to Unity. Since both are just automatic dependencies of ubuntu-desktop, which is one of the few packages, for which new versions are actually requested in the first place.\nPrograms do normally not depend on a specific version of the OS kernel, so they will normally work fine with the running kernel.\nApart from all this I suspect the Ubuntu updater throws some specific fixes and  workarounds into the mix, to circumvent situations where this theory breaks.\nAs you can see during the update there are very well conditions in which the system is only usable to a limited part. Should something go wrong during the update you will most likely be left with a broken system. Often even one which cannot easily be repaired, since the upgrade program can be affected as well. Remember, programs with broken dependencies can continue to function, but not be restarted, as long as the dependencies are broken, this goes for the updater as well.\nYou can use the command line program apt-mark to find out which packages are marked as manually installed and which have been automatically installed. You can also switch those marks using the same program. This will directly affect the update process.\nIn a more complex software setup the Updater will sometimes ask you to resolve a dependency manually. I.e. when one manually installed program gets updated and requests a new version of a library while another manually installed program depends on the old version of the same library and cannot work with the new one. You will then have to make your choice, either to relinquish one of those programs or to refrain from upgrading both. Since dependencies are often complex this can get very messy very fast (you might have heard of the term \"dependency hell\").\nNow to the specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When low-level infrastructure is changed (low-level as in kernel, drivers, libraries, etc anything that a user doesn't directly interact with), what happens to the deprecated binaries?\n\n*\n\n*OK... I already covered this one\n\n\n*What happens to an app that has been completely deprecated? For example, Unity 2D (or any other software abandoned/no maintainers whose package is not in new repo).\n\n*\n\n*If the App was once manually installed it will remain in the system, often causing the dependency hell I described.\n\n\n*ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that pulls default Ubuntu applications as dependencies. If I removed Firefox and installed Chrome, will Firefox still get pulled in as part of upgrades?\n\n*\n\n*As long as it is the standard browser of the new Release, yes. Chromium will also be upgraded. I am not sure if you can remove Firefox without removing ubuntu-desktop. Note that apart from strict dependencies, the package system knows also the concept of recommendations, where a software will normally be installed like a dependency, but can be uninstalled later without affecting anything else but its own sole dependencies.\n\n\n*Moreover, what happens if a single app used to depend on package-x and no longer does so in new release; will package-x be upgraded alongside the rest of the packages despite being orphaned?\n\n*\n\n*Nope.\n\n\n\nJust ask me if you still have any more questions.\n\nA: This is similar to another feature. Hope this helps to understand the basic process.\nI am referring to the capability to \"switch root\" when the operating system boots.\nWhen the operating system is booting, the root filesystem (read: \"/\") is initially available only in RAM. While this boot process is running, it switches / from the RAM to the / filesystem on the hard disk.\n", "Q: Export WiFi Certificates I use Ubuntu in my Laptop. I also have a Nokia N8 phone. To connect N8 to \"WPA2 Enterprise WiFi\", I need to export some certificate from my laptop.\nThe page http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=B-2D1QR8C2c explains how to export the necessary certificate from Windows 7. Can you please explain how to export the certificate from Ubuntu?\nSimply copying the file in /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla does not work.\n\nA: Are you sure you installed a digital certificate on Ubuntu to access the wireless?  Most people use a password rather than a certificate.  If you did install a certificate, then you should be able to go back to where you installed it ( right click networking -> edit connection -> 802.1x security and see what file it points to for the CA certificate.\n\nA: As Psusi pointed out, you can find the particular certificate that your laptop connection uses through the NetworkManager interface. Since using the certificate directly didn't work for you, I suspect that you may need to convert the certificate to a format that your phone accepts.\nTo convert from a PEM file to a DER file, you can use OpenSSL:\nopenssl x509 -inform PEM -outform DER -in Input.pem -out Output.der\nIf you don't have OpenSSL installed, you can find it in package manager.\n", "Q: Redefined ctrl key: can I obtain multiple strokes by holding?

I would like to re-install all the packages that I had previously installed.  Is there something in my backed-up files that would tell me what I had installed?\n\nA: The list of packages that you had installed was kept in /var/lib/dpkg/status, with daily backups of the dpkg database to /var/backups. These directories unfortunately aren't in the list of directories that you backed up.\n", "Q: What does upgrading modify? Does upgrading leave all of my applications and personal information untouched?\n\nA: Upgrading Ubuntu will leave all of your personal files untouched, and it should leave almost all of your settings untouched.  If you have made low-level customizations by for example editing files under /etc, you may find that they need adjustment after the upgrade.\n\nA: Upgrading Ubuntu just updates the repositories.\nIt's like a normal Update, but it changes the repositories first.\nUpgrading you distro will leave almost all of your settings untouched (just some will be removed, when gnome gets upgraded, for example). Upgrading your distro will leave ALL of your personal files untouchced.\nI agree with poolie, just if you have made low-level customizations, you have to adjust them after the upgrade.\nI hope this helped you,\nDaniel \n", "Q: How to run a custom set of programs in a specific workspace?

Even if I restore it, I want a full reinstall once it gets released... I feel it's needed clean up my previous issues (including missing decorations and the broken Natty)...

I got 50gb for Ubuntu, plus 200gb for windows splitted in three partitions, all packed full.\nIs there a way to do a clean reinstall without recreating the partition or backing up all the data elsewhere? I don't care about config files, just users home folder contents.\nThanks!\n\nA: One way you could do it is to turn your existing 50gb Ubuntu partition into your new /home partition, and then resize it smaller and use the newly freed space to create a new root (/) partition to install Natty into.\nBasically you would boot a livecd, then from the livecd mount your existing Ubuntu partition and delete all the contents except for /home - then you would move your own /home/username directory to the now empty root of your Ubuntu partition. This  partition is your new /home partition - then you need to resize this partition to be smaller to create space for a root partition to install Natty into (and there will be room since you already deleted all the other contents from this partition except for your home directory which you want to keep).\nWhen you then install Natty you need to select manual partitioning and specify the newly created partition as the root partition (and to let the installer format it) AND you choose the old Ubuntu partition as your /home partition (but make sure the installed DOES NOT format this otherwise you'll lose all your data).\n", "Q: Ubuntu on samsung 9 series thin laptop Has anyone tried loading ubuntu 11.04/10.10 on new Samsung Series 9 (NP900X3A).

I also tried increasing swap to something huge and it still didn't work.\nBut here's the odd thing: I just changed that setting to \"suspend to RAM\", and now it in fact hibernates just fine, in other words the screen goes blank and the hard disk stops spinning, and the light on my computer blinks, so that only the power button will wake it up again.  Regardless of what it's called, that matches my definition of hibernation.\nSimilarly, if I go to the shutdown menu and choose \"hibernate\", I again get the free swap space problem described above, but if I choose \"sleep\" then it goes into a state that perfectly matches my definition of hibernation.\nSo short answer: just use \"sleep\" or \"suspend to RAM\" and pretend it's called \"hibernate\".

Don't know why, you'll have to change that setting in the view tab below I have provided a screen shot.\n\n\nA: Egil's answer works fine for new folders, but won't take care of folders you manually assigned a view to.\nIf you want to delete those previously saved (per-folder) views, you can delete the files in ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata. Next time you start Nautilus, all folders should use the view type you set in the preferences.\n", "Q: Xbacklight can only decrease brightness I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 on a Cr48. I'm attempting to bind xbacklight -dec 10 to f6 (decrease brightness in chrome os) and xbacklight -inc 10 to f7 (increase brightness in chrome os). The decrease command works fine, but the increase command appears to have no effect. It's the same whether I run the command from the command line or use the bindings I set in CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\nA: For me, the smallest increase that works is 13. Decreases of any size dim the screen, although I cannot see any difference between -dec 1 and -dec 10\n\nA: You can change the brightness by changing some setting files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Login as root. sudo su\n\n*Type echo -n 100 > /proc/acpi/video/DVGA/LCD/brightness.\n\n*If you get a \"No such file or directory\" error, replace DVGA with VGA.\n\n*100 is the highest brightness level (100%). For example, just change the 100 to 50, to dim your display by 50 percent.\nI hope this helped you and I don't know if it's possible to fix this bug with xbacklight. If you really want to work with xbacklight, I'd create a bug report.\n-- Daniel\n\nA: I had this same issue at first... I think it's that the default is to take 20 steps to complete the transition... this combined with your small 10% change breaks things it seems.\nI got mine to work by making my functions as such:\nbrightness up => xbacklight -steps 1 -inc 20\nbrightness down => xbacklight -steps 1 -dec 20\n\n\n*\n\n*Also, I saw in the above answer about LCD vs OVGA. You won't get LCD becuase it's a notebook. They should be OVGA ... something like: /proc/acpi/video/OVGA/DD01/\n\n\nBut if you setup your steps to be 1 and increase your percent changes to 20 or more you should be just fine with xbacklight!\n", "Q: How to make X.org listen to remote connections on port 6000? This is on Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) 64-bit desktop.\nI want to make my X server listen to remote connections from clients in other machines on the local network. I know about ssh -X and that is not what I want. I vaguely remember changing something like TCPListen from no to yes, but I don't remember where this change should be applied.\nI'm interested in either a GUI method or a CLI one.\nPS editing /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc to remove the -nolisten tcp option and rebooting does not work.\n\nA: This answer is related to Kubuntu 17.04 and 20.04 and I added it, because none of the other answers (related to gdm or lightdm) helped me. In my case sddm was running. To check this, run for instance\nps -eal | grep sddm\n\nIf it is is running, processes sddm and sddm-helper are shown. In this case add a configuration file /etc/sddm.conf with content\n[X11]\nServerArguments=-listen tcp\n\nfor 20.04 or \n[XDisplay]\nServerArguments=-listen tcp\n\nfor 17.04. After creation of this file reboot your system (may be a sddm restart is sufficient). As a consequence \nps ax | grep sddm \n\nshows the desired Xorg option -listen tcp and the X Server is ready for incoming connections (don't forget to add the remote host with xhost).\n\nA: Ubuntu 18.04 running as lubuntu 18.04 with lightdm 1.26.0, this is what I had to do (only took me a couple weeks to figure it all out). You have to create both /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and /etc/lightdm.conf.d/50-xserver-command.conf as follows:\nsudo vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf:\n[Seat:*]\n\nxserver-allow-tcp=true\nxserver-command=X -listen tcp\n\nsudo vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-xserver-command.conf:\n[Seat:*]\n\nxserver-command=X -core -listen tcp\n\nThis will cause lightdm to run Xorg with the following command line:\nXorg -listen tcp :0 -seat seat0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -listen tcp vt7  \n   -novtswitch\n\nThis has \"-listen tcp\" twice, but it doesn't hurt anything. If you don't have both files, one of the Xorg options will be \"-nolisten tcp\" which overrides the other \"-listen tcp\".\nI finally found the clues to this here.\nThen add: xhost + to your .bashrc\nRestart and check that Xorg is now listening on port 6000:\n$ netstat -nal | grep 6000\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     \ntcp6       0      0 :::6000                 :::*                    LISTEN     \n\nEnjoy...\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 18.04, I looked at the running processes and figured out the display manager being used is gdm3:\n$ ps ax|grep dm\n 1515 ?        Ssl    0:00 /usr/sbin/gdm3\n\nThen I edited /etc/gdm3/custom.conf and added a line:\n[security]\nDisallowTCP=false\n\nAs mentioned, opening up port 6000 is not secure. However, I'm using this only at home network and the port is further secured by iptables to open up only to my primary laptop, it should be ok.\n\nA: The following command works without modifying any configuration options or restarting the window manager.\nOpen a terminal window and run this:\nsocat -d -d TCP-LISTEN:6000,fork,bind=172.17.0.1 UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 &\n\nIt will open TCP port 6000 as a bi-directional channel to the file system-based socket /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 that your window manager listens to.\nThe & at the end means that the command continues running in the background as long as the terminal is open. For some uses, running it only when needed is more secure, but if you need the port to be always open, I recommend creating a service with systemd.\nOn my computer, the 172.17.0.1 is the Docker network card. Alternatively, you can use 127.0.0.1 to limit access to local connections or 0.0.0.0 to even allow connections from outside (Firewall recommended).\nWhen using socat for the first time, you need to install it:\nsudo apt install socat\n\nTested with Ubuntu 20.04.\n\nA: (Here follows an almost verbatim copy of a self-answer from an identical question on serverfault which I'd forgotten about; askubuntu wasn't yet created).\nBased on information found in this page about enabling XDCMP and the file /etc/gdm/gdm.schemas, I managed to create a /etc/gdm/custom.conf file:\n# /etc/gdm/custom.conf\n[xdmcp]\n\n[chooser]\n\n[security]\nDisallowTCP=false\n\n[debug]\n\nTake care with letter case: it won't work, if you write \"disallowTCP=false\"...\nI also changed the /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc file to:\nexec /usr/bin/X11/X\n\ni.e. I removed the -nolisten tcp options to the X executable. I don't know if I needed to. You might want to try avoiding this edit.\nIf you only change the xserverrc file, X will nevertheless start with \"-nolisten TCP\".\nAfter that, all that is needed is a restart of the gdm process:\nsudo service gdm restart\n\nYou can verify the success as:\ntzot@tzot-laptop:/etc/X11\n$ netstat -an | grep -F 6000\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\ntcp6       0      0 :::6000                 :::*                    LISTEN\n\nUpdate\nAfter an upgrade to 12.04, I had the same issue. This time, the culprit is the lightdm that the system uses. The file that needs to be updated is /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and the required addition is a xserver-allow-tcp=true in the [SeatDefaults] section.\nAnd afterwards, I also found that answer. :)\nSynopsis\nSo, in 10.10 this still works: create /etc/gdm/custom.conf with contents as specified above and restart gdm.\n\nA: For Slim change the option xserver_arguments in /etc/slim.conf. And restart your X session.\n\nA: On Xubuntu 20.04, which uses lightdm, it seems to be cleaner now. Just adding xserver-allow-tcp=true to the [Seat:*] section of /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf is enough.\n\nA: First: you should not edit the file /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc. Instead copy the file into your HOME directory and give it the name .xserverrc. Then edit the file in your HOME directory.\nSecond: these files are only used by startx. See the man-page. If you start your X server with another tool, you have to configure that tool appropriately.\n\nA: On ubuntu 20 the only way to put Xorg listening in port 6000 is editing the binary \"/usr/libexec/gdm-x-session\" and change the string \"-nolisten\" to \"-listen\".\nLet the \"/etc/gdm3/custom.conf\" with option: \"[security] DisallowTCP=true\".\nMake a copy of \"gdm-x-session\" to \"gdm-x-session.org\" for security. If anything goes wrong you can restore the original file.\nMake a copy of \"gdm-x-session\" in \"/tmp\". You cannot edit the binary directly , it is opened and the OS does not let you save the changes\nTo edit, run hexedit (install if not already) and change the string \"-nolisten\" to \"-listen\". This string is in the address \"0xA46E\" of the file, once you have executed \"hexedit /tmp/gdm-x-session\".\nTake care of trailing nulls, this is, the new string in HEX is \"2D  6C  69 73 74 65  6E 00 00 00\"\nPres Ctrl+X to save and exit.\nGo to maintenance mode \"init 1\".\nCopy the \"/tmp/gdm-x-session\" to \"/usr/libexec/gdm-x-session\".\nReboot the computer and.. voila !!! \"netstat -n -a | grep LISTEN\" reports ther is Xorg listening in port 6000.\n", "Q: How do I type a backtick in RubyMine with a Swedish keyboard layout? I am currently saddled with a Swedish keyboard at work (TMALSS: I left my nice Japanese one at home), which has some deadkeys, one of which is backtick.\nI can type a backtick just fine in any application save RubyMine (and probably any stupid JVM app) either by pressing S-Backtick S-Backtick (i.e. pressing Backtick twice whilst holding down Shift), or by pressing S-Backtick Space.\nAny clues what could be going on here? It almost certainly has to be Java, but I don't know anything about adjusting Java input settings or whatever.\n\nA: I couldn't reproduce the problem in RubyMine on natty.\nIf you still suffer from the problem, try the following work-around: change the system keyboard layout from Keyboard Preferences > Layouts > Add and pick Country: Sweden and Variants: Sweden Eliminate dead keys. That will give you the backtick by just pressing S-Backtick. If you need to change between the regular and eliminate dead keys layout variants, keep both available in layouts and set a convenient hot key to switch (in the Layouts tab click on Options... and then Key(s) to change layout).\n", "Q: Thunderbird or Evolution? Before I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 (I formatted my harddisk and installed it), I used thunderbird.\nNow I wanted to test out evolution. I think it's pretty good, because there are integrated notifications and encryption methods. Another thing is that there's a calendar integrated in evolution, but I can also install a calendar addon for thunderbird.\nWhat do you think about it? Can you tell me the pros and cons of thunderbird and evolution? I don't know which program I should use.\nI never used evolution before 10.10, I always installed thunderbird.\nShould I move to evolution, or stay with thunderbird? I like both of them, I just need some pros and cons.\nIf you think both email programs are bad, tell me a better one.\n\nA: Thunderbird is likely to become the default mail client as soon as its issues with calendar, contacts and messaging menu are solved. There aren't any blueprints on this yet but Maverick's one suggests this change in the future. So if you don't want setup Evolution now and then Thunderbird in the future, then I would go with the latter one.\n\nA: I used both before, but now I stick to the trio fetchmail + mutt + msmtp, to retrieve, manage and send e-mail respectively.\nRegardless of the pros/cons with Evolution VS Thunderbird, there isn't all that much difference between using any of the two (Evolution being slow with IMAP annoyed me though).  Therefore, I suggest you have a look at mutt to see for yourself how a mail reader can be completely different.\n\nA: Try both, I use evolution, I prefer it. I have used Thunderbird, it is good as well but does not work the way I want it to. So I use evolution. Use each one for at least a week. Then decide. \n\nA: I'd +1 for Thunderbird, because its so simple to move the whole profile around (found this very userful when working with different computers + OS).\nAlso, as mentioned above, I found IMAP to be \"slow\" in Evolution - does Evolution support IMAP idle?\n\"Lightning\" for Thunderbird + Google-calender Provider works perfectly for me, and with \"Thunderbird Indicator App\" ( ppa:ruben-verweij/thunderbird-indicator ) you get the tray-icon + notifications.\n\nA: If you are going to use MS Exchange mailboxes , evolution is the mail client. Thats the pro for evolution.\nIf you are using IMAP, POP accounts, thunderbird is better. Thunderbird also has an addon for the osd notifications. It is faster than evolution in retrieving emails and you get a lot of useful addons with thunderbird . Plus , in evolution, tables created in ms outlook are not shown. I think evolution does not read them but thunderbird does.\nSo my vote goes for Thunderbird.\n\nA: I like Evolution better, but like the man said. Try them both.\nEvolution is intregrated into the desktop well. It has a nice working calendar (which I need on a daily basis). And it handles pop3 accounts much better than Thunderbird (which is not pop3 friendly).\n\nA: Obviously you need to try both. I have done so and here is my opinion: \nI used Evolution with Ubuntu for about 5 years (because I like its integration with Ubuntu) but have very recently changed to Thunderbird (I use both a gmail account and an Ms Exchange Server account). Gmail is fine with both Evolution and Thunderbird but the former is terrible with IMAP (very slow and inconsistent and I finally ran out of patience and time). There is a MAPI plugin for Evolution but even with the help of the maintainers of our Ms Exchange Server I could not get it to work. Thunderbird is much more sophisticated and faster and has a number of items that I find very useful. The most valuable for me is something very simple: the ability to save replies in the same folder as the original e-mail. I find this invaluable, especially as I deal with huge amounts of mail. I requested this as an enhancement to Evolution about 3 years ago but nothing has happened. The only downside with Thunderbird is its lack of integration with Ubuntu. However, this is coming: I already have an extension that puts Thunderbird on the bar in Ubuntu 11.04 and it will be better integrated with the next version of Thunderbird (see http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2011/03/15/my-campaign-to-get-thunderbird-integrated-into-ubuntu-natty-narwhal-continues/). In summary: I find that I can manage my mail much more easily, efficiently and quickly with Thunderbird, despite its currently imperfect integration with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have used Evolution before, and I find it can be a little slow at times, but any app can be like that :-)\nCertainly, I would just suggest to use the one you prefer, I prefer the good old internet, but I think I may switch to Evolution. It means it would take less time than open Firefox, open Gmail, Look through the list, wait for each email to load, while Evolution just downloads them in 'chunks'. Never really tried Thunderbird before, but meh.\n\nA: I thought Thunderbird was going to be integrated with Natty's Messaging menu.  http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/02/thunderbird-messaging-menu-integration-ready-for-wider-testing/\nFor me the integration is a big reason to choose one over the other. Personally I've always used Thunderbird because I find it to be more intuitive and easy to figure things out. Maybe it's cause I'm used to Firefox? \n\nA: If your email server uses IMAP, then you don't need to commit to any one client. Try them all. Personally, I prefer the Gmail web interface.\n\nA: I find Thunderbird to be lightweight compared to evolution. Sometimes trying to do too much isn't the best solution.\n\nA: If you have a mobile device or other kind of thing like a palm pilot, THUNDERBIRD WILL NOT WORK WELL WITH IT. The other thing you may want to consider is that Thunderbird does not integrate seamlessly into the display theme, last I checked. There are some problems on laptops or desktops with smaller than a 16.3\" display and certain drivers for ATI mobile and legacy Nividea cards.\n\nA: Thunderbird worked best for me.
