["Q: Running graphical program on Ubuntu via Mac OSX Terminal - Keep program running? I'm having problems knowing whether a program is running in the background.\nThe program is run via command line, but the computer is just a server (apologies if terminology is incorrect), which we access using our own computer's command line. In this instance, I am using my Mac's terminal to run the program, which can take 20 hours or so. \nI've read the forums on the use of nohup and & to keep this process running, even when I disconnect by closing terminal, or putting my laptop on sleep - however, it doesn't seem to work. This is only an assumption - using htop, I checked to see whether the process was running, but found that it wasn't there.\nIt may be the initial command that isn't working. This is currently what I type:\nnohup recon-all -all -s &\n\n(\"recon-all -all -s\" being the command)\nThis doesn't start the process, but generates a nohup.txt file in the directory that I was currently in. Only when I remove nohup from the command does it work.\nI was wondering if anybody has any ideas about how I get this process to run? Is it a problem of the command?\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: I also have a similar situation: I often use my Mac terminal to launch commands on my Ubuntu server.\nOne thing you did not mention in your question is the way you connect to your Ubuntu server from the Mac terminal. If you do not connect to the Ubuntu server first, all your commands typed in the Mac terminal will be executed by the Mac itself, not by the Ubuntu server.\nTo connect to your Ubuntu server from the Mac terminal, type one of the following commands depending on the configuration of your Ubuntu server:\ntelnet <IP address or DNS name of your Ubuntu server>\n\nor\nssh <IP address or DNS name of your Ubuntu server>\n\nOnce you are correctly logged in your ubuntu server, the prompt will indicate it by displaying the IP address or DNS name of your ubuntu server.\nThen, you can type your commands as if you were in an Ubuntu server terminal.\nWhen I tested what you want to do, I had not to use the nohup command. The \"&\" thing was enough.\nIn my test case, I connected to the Ubuntu Sever from my Mac terminal through the ssh command, then I launched my command from the connected Mac terminal :\nssh myServerDNSname\nx11vnc &\n\nAt this time, when I analyse the process hierarchy using ps -elaf command, the x11vnc process is attached to a -bash process that is attached to the sshd process (the one that corresponds to the ssh session).\nThen, I disconnect from the ssh session (ctrl + D or type exit in the Mac terminal).\nThe x11vnc process is still running: it has been automatically attached to the root process \"1\".\n", "Q: KDE Open recently closed application How do I open application, that I have recently closed in Kubuntu ?\nUPD\nIt would be great to have keyboard shortcut for this action.\nUPD2\nI mean reopen last closed application, similar to Ctrl+Shift+T in Google Chrome, wich reopens last closed tab.\n\nA: If you click on the Launcher, and click on Recently Used, you will see your most recently used/closed applications on the top.\n", "Q: Installing proprietary NVIDIA driver for Geforce 9600 GT on Ubuntu 14.04 I would like to use CUDA on my Ubuntu machine with the graphics card NVIDIA Geforce 9600 GT. Installing CUDA is no problem but in order to run any CUDA code I need to install the proprietary NVIDIA driver as well. \nI did so by choosing an appropriate one (for example, 331) from the list popping up in the \"Additional drivers\" menu. The installation works just fine but whenever I reboot the system all I see is a black screen with a blinking cursor.\nAfter purging all NVIDIA related stuff (sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*), I'm able to use the system again after rebooting.\nI read somewhere that this problem might be related to the fact that I have to use DVI instead of VGA as there are no other output ports on the card. However, switching from one DVI output port to another doesn't help either.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I've found that manual installs work best for installing nvidia drivers, so go to here and download the latest drivers.  By default, it'll most likely go into /Downloads, but if not, just know where it is.  Then, you'll want to press \n\nctrl + alt +F1-F6 (each is a different login)\n\nAnd then sign in to your account.  Then, you'll want to use\n\nsudo stop lightdm (or sudo service lightdm stop)\n\nThis shuts down the things that are using the GUI, so they can be updated.\nThen run\nchmod +x ~/* Folder that said driver is located in * / * Driver *\nFor example,\n\nchmod +x ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nMake SURE that you have the entire name of the driver, otherwise this will not work!  Caps do matter!\nWhat you just did was make the file executable.  Next, you'll want to run the following command, changed of course like the example above to fit your directories/driver versions.\n\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nFor me, tabbing the rest of the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run file does not work for me, but it is CRUCIAL THAT YOU DO THIS.  If nothing happens after you run the second command, check your caps and spelling to make sure they are right.  You have to go through the program using the keyboard to correctly install it.  For me it will tell me that something went wrong right on the bat, just keep going and see if it still works.  If it asks you to install 32 bit libraries, do so.  Some programs (like steam games) will not run unless you have these installed.\nAfter all of the above has been done, one final command must be completed, or of course you could reboot.  \n\nsudo start lightdm (or sudo service lightdm start)\n\nThen, you'll do\n\nctrl + alt+ F7-F9ish (F7 is usually default, some people have different F keys though)\n\nThis should have worked for most people, if not keep looking, there's always a fix.  If anyone knows something about getting virtual 7.1 audio to work, please message me somehow.  Thanks.  Hope I helped someone.\nI've also heard x-swat repositories work better at times.  Not sure about that, but worth a try.\n(Pro tip, whenever Nvidia related stuff goes wrong, watch this.)\n", "Q: Why dont changes to the swappiness remain permanent after reboot? System Ubuntu 14.04\nI want to change my swappiness from the default 60 to 10. According to this answer https://askubuntu.com/a/103916/71679 I need to log in as root and edit /proc/sys/vm/swappiness and add or edit to vm.swappiness = 10\nWhen opening that file as root I only see the number 60 when I add vm.swappiness = 10and try to save I get  Error writing /proc/sys/vm/swappiness: Invalid argument \nIf I simply change 60 to 10 the file saves without issue I check the changes take place with cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness it shows the changes took place\nBy editing this file as root I was under the assumption the changes would remain permanent but once I shut down and restart the default is back to 60. Why aren't the changes remaining permanent? What writes the file back to 60 after reboot?\n\nA: If you want to set the swapiness without rebooting you could execute the following command:\necho 10 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nThis will set the swapiness to 10 in this case. You can only echo a number because all this will do is call a kernel function to set the swapiness to 10 and this function only accepts numbers (this explains why you get a invalid argument error: you're trying to write other characters than numbers).\nHowever, this is only temporary. The value will be reset at the next reboot to the default value.\nTo make the change permanent:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/sysctl.conf as root\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n\n*Add the following line to the file:\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\n\n*Save the file using CTRL + X\nThe changes made to sysctl.conf will apply on reboot or you can reload them using sudo sysctl -p (so sudo sysctl -p will have the same effect as echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness in this case).\n", "Q: Windows boot manager error Ubuntu 14.04 My Thinkpad arrived with Windows 7. I upgraded to Windows 8. Shortly after I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a separate partition. Shortly after Windows crashed irretrievably (no DVD, no access to anyone with Win 8 to create DVD). So carried on using Ubuntu and upgraded to 14.04\nRecently upgraded another laptop from XP to Win 8.1 and decided to resurrect Win 8 on the Thinkpad on its original partition. No probs except now although both O/S are offered in the Windows start panel only Win 8 boots.\nThis is the error info I get when trying to use Ubuntu:\nWindows Boot Manager  \nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.  \nTo fix the problem:\n\n  1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer. \n  2. Choose your language settings, and then click \"Next.\"\n  3. Click \"repair your computer.\"\n\nIf you don't have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer\nmanufacturer for assistance. \n\n  File: \\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr    \n\n  Status: 0xc000000f  \n\n  Info: The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required  \n        file is missing or contains errors.\nAny suggestions for a reasonably amateur user? Thanks \n\nA: Master Boot Record(MBR) of Windows is corrupted. Try to repair start-up of Windows using Automatic Start-up Repair. You need a Windows DVD to do so. But be careful you may not be able to boot into Ubuntu afterwords.\n", "Q: Keeping color from vim with grep I like the way vim highlights the output from syslog.  However, I only want the most recent outputs to be opened.  I tried\ngrep --color=always \"$@\" /var/log/syslog  > /tmp/fileOUT\nvim /tmp/fileOUT\n\nbut it gives the bash color output like [033;m blah blah.  If I don't include --color=always, there is no color at all.  How can I do this?  (I'm using bash)\n\nA: Well, vim uses color template files for syntax highlighting. This has nothing to do with the output of grep which uses ANSI escape sequences (the \\[033; stuff you mentioned). \nMy vim doesn't have a style file for syslog and does not color it (I checked both on Debian and on Ubuntu 14.04). If you look at the relevant file on your system, you will find it starts with a regular expression that defines the files to match against. So, if you make your /tmp/fileOUT match that syntax, it should be colored. Don't use --color=always, that will just screw things up. \nAlternatively, you could use source-highlight. Install it with sudo apt-get install source-highlight and then run:\nsudo tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog | source-highlight --out-format=esc -o STDOUT -s log\n\nThe command above will color the last 50 lines of /var/log/syslog:\n\n", "Q: How to update Adobe Flash Player in Kubuntu latest update I've been having problems with updating Adobe Flash Player. I downloaded the tar.gz but to be honest I'm completely lost from there.\n\nA: You should just install the latest version from the Ubuntu repositories. It is a lot easier and normally they keep this one up-to-date with new Linux Flash releases.\nTo install it run the command sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nA: I'd recommend using Freshplayer rather than the flashplugin-installer package.  Freshplayer uses the (much newer, still updated) Windows Flash Player via Wine and API redirection in Firefox and SeaMonkey (probably in other Mozilla-based browsers as well, such as IceWeasel).  It updates within 2-3 days of new releases, so maintains security, and provides a Flash Player that appears up to date to web sites that block old/insecure Flash versions.  I've been using it for quite a while, and find it very stable.  It was also easy to install.\nIt does have the same hardware requirements as the current Windows Flash Player, so won't work on 32-bit processors made before about 2002, but most of those machines won't work well in Ubuntu anyway because of instruction set or RAM limitations.\n", "Q: How can I set different permissions for files and folders separately? I want to apply 644 permissions only for all files in current directory, and 755 permissions only for subdirectories in current directory with chmod\n\nA: Use find:\nfind ./ -type f -maxdepth 1 -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\nfind ./ -type d -maxdepth 1 -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-type f: Files\n\n*-type d: Directories\n\n*-maxdepth 1: first level (to avoid default recursive behavior)\n\n*-exec: execute command on with argument from result \n\n*{} will be replaced with a line from results. try:\nfind ./ -type d -maxdepth 1 -exec echo hi{}low \\;\n\nThis useful for commands which have different arguments order like ln:\nln -s {} ./otherfolder/{}\n\nor cp\ncp {} ./otherfolder/\n\n\n*\\; to to tell -exec is the end of command because you can add other find options after -exec (so they will not mix up). try:\nfind ./ -type d -maxdepth 1 -exec echo\n\nReference: man find\n", "Q: How to install Apache with Openssl 1.0.1? I want to test Heartbleed on Apache Server. I removed Apache and Openssl from my OS (Ubutu 12.04). I wonder how can I install Apache WITH  the Openssl version 1.0.1 in order to be able to test this vulnerability on my own localhost (Apache Server) ?\n\nA: Yes, you can compile it yourself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download OpenSSL 1.0.1f:\nwget http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1f.tar.gz\n\n\n*Extract openssl-1.0.1f.tar.gz:\ntar -xvzf openssl-1.0.1f.tar.gz\n\n\n*Enter the created directory:\ncd openssl-1.0.1f\n\n\n*Configure OpenSSL:\n./config\n\n\n*Compile OpenSSL:\nmake\n\n\n*Test if everything went right:\nmake test\n\n\n*Install OpenSSL:\nsudo make install\n\nNow OpenSSL is installed on your PC and you can test it.\n", "Q: Mistakes in terminal I don't know why, but after installing some programs there's been a mistake in the terminal.

I thought that colored text was just something dictated by my gnome terminal preferences, however, I've discovered there's something slightly more to this because when I'm on my ubuntu VPS, text that should be colored (git commands for example) are just white.\nSo my first question is, why does my vps have no colors and can I get them \"back\" relatively easily?\nSecondly, just so there is a visual distinction between my local terminal and the VPS, is there a configuration file on the server I can edit, so that all text that normally would be white is now yellow or something? \nA few times I've been confused and then realised I'm actually logged into my VPS :P\n\nA: There are different files/options controlling this for different programs. For example, to get ls tp print in color, you can use ls --color=tty (which is set by default on Ubuntu). For grep, you can use grep --color=auto. This is handled by the programs themselves, so it's not set in the terminal emulator or the shell. Anyway, to turn on these two options, you can create aliases to them. Edit (or create if not there) ~/.bash_aliases and add these lines:\nalias grep='grep --color'\nalias ls='ls --color=tty'\n\nThen, open a new terminal (or run . ~/.bash_aliases) and you will have colored ls and grep output.\nAnyway, for git, this is set in your ~/.gitrc file (see, for example, here). The easiest trick would be to just copy the one from your machine to the server. \n\nAs for differentiating the terminals, the easiest approach would be to color your prompt (PS1). This is set in ~/.bashrc. You can find more details here and an app that simplifies it here but for example, you could use something like this:\nPS1='\\[\\033[01;33m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[01;34m\\] \\W \\\\$\\[\\033[00m\\] '    \n\nWhich produces:\n\nand \nPS1='\\[\\033[01;38m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[01;31m\\] \\W \\\\$\\[\\033[00m\\] '    \n\nWhich produces:\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 + Gnome 3.10 'Alt + Shift' shortcut doesn't work I just installed fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 x64 and I've found that shortcut combination 'Alt + Shift' to which I used to doesn't work.\nI can successfully switch keyboard layout with 'Super + Space' shortcut combination but it is inconvenient for me.\n\nI can see shortcuts on this screen and it seems that I should set 'Alt + Shift' to 'Switch to next source' but not to 'Modifiers-only switch to next source' BUT it is impossible to assign this shortcut to that property.\nI've seen some people can fix it with this 13.10 path but it doesn't work for me.\nIn fact when I press 'Alt + Shift' it changes current language here:  but when I type it types with previously selected language.\nWhat can I do about this?

system not being able to detect the full 8 GB of RAM (as I said, it detected only 245 MB!)\nSince I was desperate to find the answer that I needed so much, I decided to download a PDF manual for the Dell PowerEdge 2850. So I started to check the meaning of all the strange options I saw in the BIOS and if I set them to the right values.\nI was optimistic when I read in that PDF file that the OS Install Mode that I turned on value limits the RAM to 256 MB. So, I turned that option off and booted back to Ubuntu. I ran Terminal and was happy that free -m now shows 8001 MB of free RAM.\nSo as I said to @terdon, it was not a problem related to Ubuntu, but rather a wrong BIOS setting.\nI hope this answer will be useful for people who will face the same trouble with similar servers in the future.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 left launcher doesn't show up  \nI just migrated from 12.04 to 14.04 and I noticed that I can't open this launcher menu if I am not in 'Dash'\nPreviously (12.04) I could touch left edge of the desktop to trigger this menu to open, but right now it is not possible.\nCan someone point me how to achieve this?\n\nA: I think I simply forgot that I used this extension, which is by the way great extension\n\nDash to Dock\n", "Q: How to check the progress of md5sum on many huge files? I have some 500 files of 650MB each, named bigfile.000 to bigfile.199 and I need to calculate the MD5 checksum of all files combined.  The command I am using is:\ncat bigfile.* | md5sum\n\nI have the time, and I understand it will take hours to complete, but I still want to check the progress.  Is there any way to do so?

It is in the repos, and shows a nice progress bar.  \npv bigfile.* | md5sum  \n\nshould do what you want.\n", "Q: What does tar's -p (preserve permissions) flag actually preserve? What does the -p flag actually preserve when creating and extracting a tarball?\nIs it the rwx permissions it preserves?\nWhen I created a htdocs/ tarball owned by root, extracting it to my local machine changed the ownership from root to my user.\n\nA: To preserve owner run as root or use the --same-owner flag alongside the -p flag when extracting.\n\nA: Ownership and permissions are two different things. The -p flag preserves permissions. On *nix systems, regular users can't change file ownership to a user who is not themselves.\nAs explained here :\n\nOnly processes with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file or with appropriate privileges may change the ownership of a file. If _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is in effect for path:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Changing the user ID is restricted to processes with appropriate privileges.\n  \n*Changing the group ID is permitted to a process with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file, but without appropriate privileges, if and only if owner is equal to the file's user ID or ( uid_t)-1 and group is equal either to the calling process' effective group ID or to one of its supplementary group IDs.\n\nThe rationale behind this has been nicely explained by @Gilles in this Unix & Linux answer:\n\nThe reason for this restriction is that giving away a file to another\n  user can allow bad things to happen in uncommon, but still important\n  situations. For example:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If a system has disk quotas enabled, Alice could create a world-writable file under a directory accessible only by her (so no\n  one else could access that world-writable directory), and then run\n  chown to make that file owned by another user Bill. The file would\n  then count under Bill's disk quota even though only Alice can use the\n  file.\n  \n*If Alice gives away a file to Bill, there is no trace that Bill didn't create that file. This can be a problem if the file contains\n  illegal or otherwise compromising data.\n  \n*Some programs require that their input file belongs to a particular user in order to authenticate a request (for example, the\n  file contains some instructions that the program will perform on\n  behalf of that user). This is usually not a secure design, because\n  even if Bill created a file containing syntactically correct\n  instructions, he might not have intended to execute them at this\n  particular time. Nonetheless, allowing Alice to create a file with\n  arbitrary content and have it taken as input from Bill can only make\n  things worse.\n  \n\nSo, even if you use tar's --same-owner flag, you will still need to extract the files as root to preserve ownership. That flag is on by default for root, so what you want is:\nsudo tar xpf foo.tgz\n\n\nA: There are 2 more options for tar that are interesting:\n--same-owner\n       try extracting files with the same ownership as exists in the ar‐\n       chive (default for superuser)\n\n--no-same-owner\n       extract files as yourself (**default for ordinary users**)\n\nThe 2nd one is the default so you can add --same-owner to save your user. You probably will have to do this with sudo. \nBesides that: this will -only- work on systems that support POSIX. And operating systems other than Ubuntu might not have these 2 options (they are not standard).\n", "Q: Keybord problem New to 14.04 have choosed french for operating language.

Ibus and supporting Chinese and Japanese client engines are installed and im-config is used to select ibus as the active configuration.

Therefore, the only (standard) way to have 2.6.2 be \"more\" than 2.9.0 is to have the version string look like 2.9.0+really2.6.2-2ubuntu2.\nHere's the reasoning (From https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/trusty/+source/banshee/+changelog):\nbanshee (2.9.0+really2.6.1-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low\n\n  * [fbf05ca] Imported Upstream version 2.9.0+really2.6.1:\n    Downgrade to 2.6.1 -- 2.9.x is unstable and 3.0 won't arrive in time for\n    release\n  * [22de440] Revert packaging to 2.6.1-2ubuntu1\n  * [7357b73] Merge changes from 2.6.1-5\n  * [a7156c0] Filter out libgpod-cil-dev versions built against gtk#3\n  * [e7c634d] Update dversionmangle for extracting +really version out\n -- Chow Loong Jin <hyperair@debian.org>   Sun, 09 Feb 2014 23:06:03 +0800\n\n", "Q: Xperia Z network item stuck in Network Manager applet In the Network Manager applet on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have an extra item called 'Xperia Z Network' with the network name 'Xperia Z' and a greyed out status 'disconnected'. Unfortunately I can't take a screenshot of the applet (it closes if I press print screen). This item is between 'Ethernet Network' and 'Wifi Networks'.\nIf I click on 'edit connections' the item is not there and there is no network by the same name to remove.\nI do own an Xperia Z, so it somehow made a connection with it once. But the menu item remains there even if the phone is powered off and ubuntu rebooted. Also the only connection I ever made with the phone is by setting up a tethered hotspot from my phone, with a different name.\nSo why is the item in my Network Manager and how do I get it to go away and not reappear. \n\nA: First, try \"Edit connections...\" from the Network Manager applet. If the connection does not show up in the list, or cannot be removed from the list, find the corresponding file in /etc/Network Manager/system-connections and remove it.\n", "Q: lightdm: cannot type password on login screen I am running 12.04 LTS, fully updated. My system is configured to automatically log me in into my account. Auto-login works fine.\nHowever, sometimes I need to access the unity-greeter/lightdm login screen. For example, this happens when I log out and then want another user want to log into their account. The interface we get is exactly the one shown on the Wikipedia page for LightDM:\n\n\n*\n\n*the password prompt is grayed out and I am unable to type my password\n\n*the mouse moves fine but I cannot click the system icons on the\ntop-right corner of the menu bar does not work\n\n*I can switch using ctrl-alt-f? to a console and login fine using the text/console login prompt. If I kill X, I am again returned to the same unusable login screen. \n\n\nHow can I fix this? How can a user log into their graphical environment without having to reboot the system?\n\nA: I have encountered the same on random occasions on my 14.04 LTS installation. I have not been able to reproduce it. Sometimes it just happens and I am stuck at login.\nI have added this alias to to my .bash_aliases file as a workaround that have worked so far:\nalias saveme=\"export XDG_SEAT_PATH=/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Seat0 && dm-tool switch-to-greeter && logout\"\n\nWhen login prompt is grayed out. I switch to e.g. tty1 with Ctrl+Alt+F1, login and just enter my alias: saveme.\nThis way you will not lose any work from open applications. When you restart lightdm you will lose everything you had running which was really annoying and something I wanted to avoid..\nXDG_SEAT_PATH may not be the same for you. Check while logged in in a terminal:\nenv | grep -i XDG_SEAT_PATH\n\nYou can also check with:\ndm-tool list-seats\n\n\nA: The bug is still present in 16.10.   I usually ssh from another machine, kill the gnome-screensaver process and that returns me to my session.  No need to reboot.\n\nA: A workaround is to disable lock screen under power management and install xscreensaver and configure screen login from there\n\nA: The solution that worked for me was to uninstall the xscreensaver packages.\n\nA: According to the bug reported at Launchpad.\nThe bug has been fixed in an updated version of Unity: 7.2.4+14.04.20141217-0ubuntu1. This fix should be included in 15.04 release as well.\n", "Q: upgrade to 14.04 only did half upgrade When i tried upgrading to 14.04 from 13.10 it said it could only upgrade half, then i would have to upgrade the other half. well after the first half upgraded, it never mentioned to upgrade the other half. It will never update. It will say there are updates and I have a exclamation mark in the toolbar and i click install updates...nothing happens. when I use the updater it says its installing then it says all software is up to date and wont install anything but will continually say updates are available.\nI tried to run \"apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade\" but got a bunch of errors. Here is the paste bin of the results. http://pastebin.com/3nTTib2C\nI don't know what else to do a this point. I would love to avoid a clean install because I have a lot to backup and it will take me a while to backup everything manually. Thank you everyone for your help!\n_-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI had to do a clean install. Restoring the PPAs didn't work. It kept retrieving the old PPAs again. Could not figure out any other way than a clean upgrade.\n\nA: The (actual) issue here is that you have duplicate entries of the Google Chrome repos and are using repos from raring and lucid.\nStart by opening up /etc/apt/sources.list, and you should see an entry for archive.canonical.com. Change the raring there to trusty. You should also see an entry for plex.r.worldssl.net. Unless you have it set to lucid for a very good reason (also assuming that you can still use the packages from that repo), change that to trusty.\nFinally, you might see two entries for dl.google.com; if not, check to see if there are any files related to Google in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. Remove one of the two entries. If there is one entry in /etc/apt/sources.list, and a Chrome-related file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, remove the one that's in /etc/apt/sources.list.\nRun sudo apt-get update now.\n", "Q: Difference between apt-get -d install & apt-get download Apt (Advanced Packaging Tool) has option to download only package by apt-get -d install [pkg-name].\nI have also find apt-get download [pkg-name] to download packages.\nThen what is the difference between --download-only (apt-get -d install)and download (apt-get download)?\nAnd When should I use between them?\n\nA: Use the man command :)\napt-get download will download the package, but not its dependencies, to the current directory.\napt-get -d install will download the given package and all missing dependencies to the system packages directory (/var/cache/apt/archives).\nUse the first if you want to download a .deb to then tinker with it (uncompress it, poke at it with dpkg, whatever).\nUse the second if you want to \"pre-download\" a set of packages for later installation.\n\nA: I could list following:\n\n*\n\n*Try both without sudo, apt-get download will pass and apt-get -d install will fail (root required)\n\n\n*By default apt-get -d install will save .deb in /var/cache/apt/archives and apt-get download in current directory\n\n\n*apt-get download is newer, you wouldn't even find it in the old versions.\nFrom man page:\n\ndownload download will download the given binary package into the current directory.\n-d, --download-only Download only; package files are only retrieved, not unpacked or installed. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download-Only.\n\n\nA: The --download-only switch needs to be accompanied by another command, be it install, upgrade or whatever command would require to download package. If you don't need to download packages, is plain as day that it wouldn't download anything. --download-only restricts apt actions to just downloading the packages that it needs into the cache directory, nothing more. If your operation would end into downloading dependencies it will download them for you.\nSince it needs a command like install or upgrade it normally would require sudo or root permissions, since the default directory used to download the packages is owned by root.\nThe download command is standalone, it reads the package list and download only the package specified, it doesn't download dependencies nor other packages. It doesn't require root permissions if you can write your current directory, this wouldn't store the files in the package cache directory.\n", "Q: Is there a short way to purge all printer configurations? An Ubuntu 14.04 which I have been maintaining has a lot of non-working printer configurations. I'd like to purge it all and configure only the working ones from the scratch. Any ideas to remove them all preferably via command line? \n\nA: Stop cupsd:\nsudo stop cups\nthen edit the printer configuration:\nsudo cp /etc/cups/printers.conf /etc/cups/printers.conf.backup\nsudo nano /etc/cups/printers.conf\n\nRemove all printer information and save.\n\nA: This post was first search result on google for me while searching for a way to remove all printers from cups.

Proper way would be to set up openvpn to listen on some other port (say, 0.0.0.0:18000) and configure sslh to redirect openvpn connections to 127.0.0.1:18000. This way you will be able to connect to openvpn directly should sslh fail for whatever reason, but also will be able to use sslh to serve openvpn on port 443.\nAlso, you might want to post your config for both here.\n\nA: You need to stop the related services first and then restart the services after your installation/configuration of sslh. server config of the openvpn should be listen to specified ip 127.0.0.1 and port 1194(either tcp or udp). sslh config should be --openvpn 127.0.0.1:1194.\nclient config of the openvpn should be remote x.x.x.x:443\n", "Q: Is iLuv USB Audio Adapter supported in Linux?

There was a ~/.bashrc there by default but I replaced it with a ~/.bash_profile.\nHowever, when I log in, something before my ~/.bash_profile gets sourced and displays the following:\nLinux ubnt10-dev1 2.6.32-38-server #83-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 4 11:26:59 UTC 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nUbuntu 10.04.4 LTS\n\nWelcome to the Ubuntu Server!\n * Documentation:  http://www.ubuntu.com/server/doc\n\n  System information as of Fri May  9 12:17:39 EDT 2014\n\n  System load:  0.01              Processes:           74\n  Usage of /:   5.5% of 18.58GB   Users logged in:     0\n  Memory usage: 4%                IP address for eth0: 123.x.x.x\n  Swap usage:   0%\n\n  Graph this data and manage this system at https://landscape.canonical.com/\n\nNew release 'precise' available.\nRun 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.\n\nLast login: Fri May  9 12:11:52 2014 from 123.x.x.x\n\nI would like to remove that so that only my own splash greeting defined in my ~/.bash_profile gets displays but I am not sure about the logic/sequence of scripts sourced/executed when a user logs in.  Can you enlighten me?\nAs a bonus, I would also like to know the sequence of automated sourcings/execs when the system starts, not just when a user starts a session by logging in, albeit this is a concern of lesser importance to me right now.\n\nA: This is kind of complex. First of all, the details depend on what kind of shell you are running. To plagiarize myself:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you open a terminal emulator (gnome-terminal for example), you are executing what is known as an interactive, non-login shell. \n\n*When you log into your machine from the command line, or run a command such as su - username, you are running an interactive login shell.\n\n*When you log in graphically, you are running something completely different. The details will depend on your system and graphical environment but in general, it is the graphical shell that deals with your login. While many graphical shells (including the Ubuntu default) will read /etc/profile and ~/.profile not all of them do.\n\n*Finally, when you run a shell script, it is run in a non-interactive, non-login shell.\nThe files that bash will read when launched depend on the type of shell it is running as. The following is an excerpt of the INVOCATION section of man bash (emphasis mine):\n\nWhen  bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes  commands  from  the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,\n   in  that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that\n  exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be  used  when  the\n   shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash\n  reads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if\n  these files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  --norc  option.\n  The  --rcfile  file option will force bash to read and execute commands\n  from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\n\nThose are the initialization files. You also have /etc/environment where you can set global environmental variables but that's read rather than sourced (commands inside it are not executed but variable definitions are set).\nNow, the greeting you see is something else again. That is set in /etc/motd and is displayed through pam_motd. As explained in man motd:\n\nThe contents of /etc/motd are displayed by pam_motd(8) after a\n  successful login but just before it executes the login shell.\nThe abbreviation \"motd\" stands for \"message of the day\", and this \n  file    has  been  traditionally  used  for exactly that (it requires\n  much less    disk space than mail to all users).\nOn Debian GNU/Linux, the content  of  /run/motd.dynamic  is  also \n  displayed.  This file is generated by /etc/init.d/motd at boot.\n\nTo remove the message just empty the /etc/motd file and make sure that nothing is being generated by /etc/init.d/motd if present.\n\nAnyway, based on the output you show, you seem to be logging in via ssh which means you're running an interactive login shell, see above for what that means. \nSo, in summary, the things you care about that are sourced when you log in are (and in this order):\n\n\n*\n\n*The SSH daemon, via the pam_motd module of the PAM library, displays the contents of /etc/motd. Via the pam_env module, it sets the environment variables from /etc/environment and ~/.pam_environment.\n\n*A login shell is started, and the following files are read in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*/etc/bash.bashrc (the default Ubuntu /etc/profile sources /etc/bash.bashrc).\n\n*~/.bash_profile. The other files that could have been read here (~/.profile and ~/.bash_login) are ignored because ~/.bash_profile exists.\n\n\n\nA: The info you are seeing when you login via ssh is created before /etc/profile is ever even looked at.  Take a look at the sequence of files in /etc/update-motd.d.  That will show you where the messages you are seeing are generated by various scripts.\n\nA: In addition, /etc/issue is sourced before login, as described in man 5 issue.\n", "Q: creating a bash alias name that contains an = I am trying to set up a ~/.bash_aliases that worked in 12.04 but now bash complains about the = sign.\nalias emacs = 'emacsclient -c -a --socket-name=server --alternate-editor='\n\nHow can I set this up?\nWhat I am told:\nbash: alias: emacs: not found\nbash: alias: =: not found\nbash: alias: `emacsclient -c -a --socket-name': invalid alias name\n\nIf I type it in directly with no alias, it works and opens emacs\n\n\nA: You need to remove the spaces around the = sign.

Please help me!\n\nA: It's exactly what it says, this ppa doesn't have packages for trusty yet. You have to wait for the developers to release packages for trusty or try to install the saucy packages manually. See here: http://ppa.launchpad.net/apt-fast/stable/ubuntu/dists/ no trusty.\n\nA: If you are using Trusty now, the ppa may change to trusty automatically. To prove this, you can select the ppa on software sources, edit, and look what binary is written there. If it is trusty and you can not change, than the sudo update and sudo upgrade will return what you experienced. I experienced this in trusty with desurium ppa. While I was able to switch the binary from 13.04 to 13.10 and vice versa in Ubuntu 13.10, I could not do it in trusty yet. Simply no other binary to choice except trusty, I do not know why. So temporary I have to abandon desurium ppa in trusty.\n", "Q: Icon Size Change I'm new to Linux, about 2 weeks.

Your garbage looking screen I suspect is graphic card problem. From my experience, I have more luck with Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit system rather than 64 system on computer with graphic card problem. Even if the computer is qualified to run Ubuntu 64 bit system. You may want to try running Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit from Live DVD or Live USB whether you have 'normal' display then. In my experience, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit first. After success, then I installed Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. On grub menu, I enter 12.04 64 bit through trouble shooting selection with minimal drive (not normal Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit), then select 'special' graphic or so (Sorry I forget the exact term, but you will recognize it when you see it, the only option with graphic), try repair package, try this and that, it did no harm, then Resume boot into 12.04 64 bit. If you manage to come into Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, then go to your System Setting and see whether you may need additional (proprietary) driver. You may also visit your graphic processor manufacturer support site and look for Linux Driver for your graphic cards. After all the try and error, in my case, from garbage screen, finally I got my notebook running normally with Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, even upgrade it all the way to Ubuntu 14.04. \n", "Q: How do I set up a KVM/NVidia Passthrough virtual machine for gaming? I've seen a guide or two that seems to be replicated around on the internet on setting up KVM to use passthrough for Nvidia. It seems to require 2 video cards.\nIs it possible to do it with 1 video card? I'm trying to see if it's possible to have a gaming machine setup so I don't have to dual boot.\nIs this possible? I've heard Xen has a passthrough of their own, but Nvidia doesn't seem to support it on their desktop cards.\nI have a GTX 760.\nIs it possible to virtualize and get native or near-native performance good enough for modern game gaming?\n\nA: Ok, I have been on this journey the last few days using Fedora 20, KVM, Xen (all from the Repo, no patches or self-builds) using a GTX260 (for the guest/windows 7) and a cheap GT610 for host/dom0:\n\n\n*\n\n*With KVM, some nvidia cards work but there are stability issues and your host can crash when rebooting the VM. I gave up on KVM because while it does work, it is far too unstable with my hardware.\n\n*I got Xen to passthrough the GTX260, it was very stable and I could shutdown the domU with no weirdness. I installed the nvidia drivers but got a common issue of windows reporting the card wasn't working correctly so I only had basic VGA capability on the guest.\n\n\nAfter some reading around, it turns out nvidia cards are pretty crippled when it comes to passthrough. AMD submitted patches to qemu/xen and AMD cards are reportedly working without too many issues on KVM. Quoting from the Xen wiki test cards:\n\nAll Radeon HD4xxx, HD6xxx and HD7xxx should work out-of-the-box as secondary adapter with Xen 4.2.1 \n\nThis means your dom0 boots on one GPU and you passthrough a second GPU to your guest. There is also some support for handing off the primary GPU to a guest but this seems much less straightforward.\nOn the nvidia front, their high-end professional \"Multi-OS\" cards to work under Xen and KVM, but this is an artificial limitation placed on home/gamer cards by nvidia. Some people have been modding their cards to report as the equivalent quattro/grid card by replacing resistors on the board. This is possible because the multi-os cards are mostly identical to some higher-end home/gaming cards minus the device ID and some spec differences. Reading the boards, there are/were patches floating around that helped the nvidia case on Windows XP guests, but ... the whole nvidia thing just seems sketchy from a virtualization angle.\nThere's lots of this around (from the Xen wiki on GPU passthrough):\n\nIt's assumed you have a ATI Card you want to passthrough, simply because NVIDIA will only work\n  a) with certain patches and\n  b) with certain Windows Versions \n\nIn conclusion, based on what I know, if you want to do passthrough gaming ... go with Xen and AMD cards with a cheap or on-board GPU for dom0 and an additional GPU for the gaming domU. Performance is very high considering the virtualisation overhead too, between 95% and 97% of native framerates in benchmarks.\nGood luck!\nSome links that help:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XenVGAPassthroughTestedAdapters\n\n*https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162768\n\n*http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/SecondaryGPUPassthrough\n\nA: You need 2 cards for VGA pass trough, if you have an on-board VGA card you can use that to boot Linux and pass the GTX760 to the VM for testing purposes. \nFor more information visit.\nKVM/Qemu guide\n", "Q: Camera keep changing it's colors from light red to light green every 0.25 sec (ubuntu 14.04) when I lunch Cheese Webcam Booth this is what the picture looks like \n\n\nand it keeps changing between these 2 colors every 0.25 sec \n\nA: I recommend going to Preferences -> Image and changing the Hue level.

Thanks.\n\nA: The reason people should use swap memory is only if there is a lack of RAM on your system. Swap is basically your hard drive being used instead of RAM, therefor it's comparatively very slow (RAM vs hard drive).\nThere are a few things you can do, one including upgrading your RAM ammount to 6 or 8GB or more. You could also disable swap altogether or change when to start swap\nIf you are running a mechanical hard drive you could also upgrade it to an SSD as that may help a little bit if you are bound to use swap.\n", "Q: Open minimized nautilus window and not open home in launcher There is some behavior I can't understand in the Unity Desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open nautilus via. clicking in the launcher onto the home-button\n\n*Navigate to for example the windows-partition in nautilus\n\n*Minimize nautilus\n\n*Click on nautilus in the launcher doesn't open the nautilus with windows-partition, instead it opens a new window with the home folder.\n\n\nIs there a workaround for this strange behavior?\nRegards,\nArthur\n\nA: This has been confirmed to be a bug on nautilus.

You will need to restart the terminal process every time you adjust the transparency to see your change, however.\nself.set_opacity((ConfigManager.get_conf('transparency')) / 100.0)\n\nThe surrounding part of that file should look like:\ndef init_transparency(self):\n    self.set_app_paintable(True)\n    visual = self.screen.get_rgba_visual()\n    if visual != None and self.screen.is_composited():\n        self.set_opacity((ConfigManager.get_conf('transparency')) / 100.0)\n        self.set_visual(visual)\n    else:\n        ConfigManager.use_fake_transparency = True\n\n\nA: To make terra transparent in 14.04 you can add this  \nself.set_opacity((ConfigManager.get_conf('transparency')) / 100.0)\n\nto the #473 line of /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/terra/terminal.py:\ndef init_transparency(self):\n    self.set_app_paintable(True)\n    visual = self.screen.get_rgba_visual()\n    if visual != None and self.screen.is_composited():\n        self.set_opacity((ConfigManager.get_conf('transparency')) / 100.0)\n        self.set_visual(visual)\n    else:\n        ConfigManager.use_fake_transparency = True\n\n", "Q: How to add Gufw to start up? want to know because I am tired of just clicking on the launcher because I just leave my laptop on.

I bought an acer aspire v5 laptop and installed Ubuntu. So far everything worked in the way I want it, except frescobaldi.\nIt's an editor for lilypond files. There's a midi-player included. I installed timidity and followed the instructions, however the midi player doesn't produce any sound. There's no error message or anything but it's pretty clear that it doesn't work. Every other sound application worked fine so far and I am able to use the timidity midi player to play my midi-files. Its just the built-in midi player in frescobaldi that doesnt work.\nHow to solve this?\nI googled it for hours now and there doesn't seem to be anyone else with a similar problem.\n\nA: When using Frescobaldi in Ubuntu 15.10, the package libportmidi0 must be installed so that Midi playback works correctly.\nJust install it using a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install libportmidi0\n\nTested with QSynth, Patchage et VMPK midi tools.\nCf. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/frescobaldi/+bug/1572566\n\nA: This is a bit late, but for future reference I found that running\nsudo timidity -iA\n\nand then refreshing the MIDI ports in Frescobaldi (Edit->Preferences->MIDI Settings->Refresh MIDI ports) does the trick in my version (2.0.13).\n\nA: There’s a old discussion of this issue on the Frescobaldi lists, in the thread\nmidi will not play from within frescobaldi.\nThe issue is that Frescobaldi is looking for an ALSA port providing a MIDI sequencer, and you need to persuade timidity to provide this.\nYou will need to start the timidity daemon by running\n\nsudo service timidity start\n\nthen refresh the MIDI ports within Frescobaldi. This just now worked for me (Ubuntu 14.10) and may be all you need. But for completeness—\nIf this does not suffice, edit /etc/default/timidity; where it says,\n\n# uncomment to override enabling triggered by availability of timidity-deamon\n      # TIM_ALSASEQ=false\n\n(i.e., it defaults to enabled but you can override this) you might need to explicitly enable the ALSA port by changing the line to\n\nTIM_ALSASEQ=true\n\n\nBut again, I found this step to be unnecessary, and probably so will you.\n", "Q: After the first update ubuntu 12.04 lost wireless alltogether After the first update the Ubuntu 12.04 lost the wireless altogether.

I have a UEFI enabled Dell Inspiron Laptop that came pre-loaded with Windows 8.\nI thought EasyBCD would solve my problems, and it did, for a while anyway. However - it (EasyBCD) does not clean up after itself if (and when) you ever make changes to your Linux side of things. \nFor example, when I updated from Ubuntu 13.10 to 12.04, EasyBCD did not roll with the changes well at all.

How do I extend/re-install Ubuntu to make use of that partition is reserved for Windows?\n\nA: OK, you are basically asking two questions and I will provide answer for both.\nYour problem is that apparently you accepted the default Ubuntu installation partition recommendation and now you want to give Ubuntu more space on your hard drive, correct?\nAnswers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Without having to re-install Ubuntu, you can resize both partitions\nby booting into a Live CD (like the one you used to install Ubuntu),\njust make sure to select \"Try Ubuntu\" instead of \"Install\" when the\nchoice appears.  Then, go to the top left corner and hit the Ubuntu\nlogo button, then type GParted.  When GParted opens up, you can\nre-size the Windows installation to make it smaller.  After this,\nmake the Ubuntu installation bigger by filling in the empty space\nthat the Windows installation left and wait for the process to end. \nExit the Live session and your partitions should be the size you\nwant them. However, since Ubuntu has already been installed, this\nmay (most likely) take longer than doing a fresh install which\nultimately is what I recommend.\n\n*If you just barely installed Ubuntu and you don't have any work\nalready saved in your installation, just go ahead and re-install. \nIt's the easiest and quickest way.  If you've already been working\non Ubuntu for a while, try to save all that you can to an external\nhard drive or to a cloud service like Dropbox before doing the fresh\ninstall.  Just make sure that when you re-install you first delete\nthe Ubuntu partition with GParted, then you make the Windows\ninstallation the size you want it to be and leave the empty space\nfor the Ubuntu installation.

I recently purchased a 120gb Samsung 840 EVO SSD to use as the boot/OS drive, and will be changing my current primary HDD (on which resides the Windows 7 install and 12.04 wubi install) to the secondary/data drive.\nMain questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I install Ubuntu onto the new drive easily from either within the Windows or Ubuntu environment or do I need to boot from CD/USB?\n\n*I understand that swapping to the SSD is bad, so I want to make sure if I keep swapping on or high swappiness that I'm swapping to the HDD and not the SSD.  How do I do this, and should I?\n\n*I've seen a shell script for migrating an existing wubi install onto a new primary install, but I'm not sure if this is good to use for an SSD or if I should start from scratch for any reason.\nAny other sagely advice is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: *\n\n*You can, for example using Wubi on Windows, and I'm sure there is something like that in Ubuntu as well. However, this doesn't install Ubuntu on ext4 but on Windows' NTFS and is therefore not as stable and fast as a normal Ubuntu installation. It may even cause data corruption easier than when on ext4. I recommend you to use a CD or USB. It's really easy to install that way and you'll get the full Ubuntu experience.\n\n*Swapping to SSD is not bad. It'll make swapping a faster (but I don't know if you can notice) and resuming from hibernate as well. However, SSD space is not so much as HDD space so if your SSD space is precious you should put your swap partition on your HDD. To do this, simply choose for custom partitioning during the installation and create a swap partition on your HDD. Ubuntu will automatically use it.\n\n*I don't have experience with this one. It could work as Ubuntu isn't bound to specific hardware like Windows is. You could even put your HDD in a different PC and it'll still boot where Windows would give you a BSOD. However, as you come from Wubi I don't know if the fstab file (that mounts all file system) will still work. I would personally do a clean install.\n", "Q: Why is nothing working right here? I used the Crouton method via Ray Waldo's website to get the Linux OS. \nI have it and at first it looked ok but there are problems already. When I switched back, Steam won't launch, I have no way of ending the application as there is no 'task manager' as far as I know like a windows computer to see if restarting it would work [so where is the task manager?] \nSecond, the Synaptic Package Manager wont run. No idea what's up with that.\nFinally why does it keep asking for administrative access passwords? My little brother is supposed to be using this computer freely without problems so I want it to stop giving the 'no access' screens whenever I put in a flash drive, and the password requests for about everything else. He is mentally differently abled and won't understand how to work around the complicated measures for him [basically it should be able to know he is the only admin and stop showing those screens.]\nAs for what the computer has, take a look at this www.walmart.com\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: There is a task manager. Search for System Monitor in Dash. It allows you to easily kill tasks, view resource usage per process, total RAM & CPU usage etc.\nUbuntu will only ask for a password when you want to change something on the PC, like remove or install software, partitioning your hard drive, adding or removing users etc. Normal tasks won't ask for a password. You can't disable it as it's how Ubuntu (and other Linux based operating systems) work.\nTo solve your problem with crashing packages we'll need more info.

This is quite shady to me and I have no idea if I am far from the solution or really close (at least if I could try localhost that would be a first step in order to check my Apache conf but I can't even do it since I ssh).\nAnyways, thanks for your help in advance. Any help, link is welcomed.\n\nA: This is actually really easy.\nFirst make sure your DNS is working. You can use a A, AAAA or CNAME record as long as it points to your IP address.\nPlease check if it's working before you continue! This will save you much trouble. You can check using ping subdomain.mydomain.com or nslookup subdomain.mydomain.com. If it's pointing to your IP address you're good.\nNote that DNS changes may take up to 24 hours. If you want to continue now, you can edit your hosts file to manually add the sub domain. Note that this will only work for your current PC so you should check your DNS again 24 hours later to make sure it's working elsewhere as well (don't forget to revert your changes to your hosts file before you check).\nTo do this:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nadd line like (replacing the IP and hostname of course):\n34.54.235.64 subdomain.mydomain.com\n\nand save the file.\nNow update your Apache2 configuration.\nJust adding this VirtualHost will do:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName subdomain.mydomain.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/subdomain.mydomain.com\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNow create /var/www/subdomain.mydomain.com and restart Apache2:\nmkdir -p /var/www/subdomain.mydomain.com\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nenable the site:\nsudo a2ensite subdomain.mydomain.com\n\nRepeat this for every sub domain you want to add.\n", "Q: ubuntu can't get correct ip config from router At a point, all my network settings went crazy. nameserver point to 192.168.0.1, and ip address is 192.168.0.xxx. nslookup no response (Can't resolve any address).

Usually you want routers (devices that forward) to have static addresses.\nThis is documented in the Linux IPv6 HOWTO.\nHere is the relevant part:\n\nforwarding\nType: BOOLEAN\nDefault: FALSE if global forwarding is disabled (default), otherwise\n  TRUE\nConfigure interface-specific Host/Router behaviour.\nNote: It is recommended to have the same setting on all interfaces;\n  mixed router/host scenarios are rather uncommon.\nValue FALSE: By default, Host behaviour is assumed. This means:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*IsRouter flag is not set in Neighbour Advertisements.\n  \n*Router Solicitations are being sent when necessary.\n  \n*If accept_ra is TRUE (default), accept Router Advertisements (and do autoconfiguration).\n  \n*If accept_redirects is TRUE (default), accept Redirects.\n  \n  \n  Value TRUE: If local forwarding is enabled, Router behaviour is\n  assumed. This means exactly the reverse from the above:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*IsRouter flag is set in Neighbour Advertisements.\n  \n*Router Solicitations are not sent.\n  \n*Router Advertisements are ignored.\n  \n*Redirects are ignored.\n  \n\nBy setting forwarding to TRUE your machine will behave like a router. You either need to force it to accept Router Advertisements (RAs) or you need to manually configure your addresses and routes.\nTo enable autoconf even when using forwarding use this:\n\naccept_ra\nType: BOOLEAN\nAccept Router Advertisements; autoconfigure using them.\nPossible values are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*0: Do not accept Router Advertisements.\n  \n*1: Accept Router Advertisements if forwarding is disabled.\n  \n*2: Overrule forwarding behaviour. Accept Router Advertisements even if forwarding is enabled.\n  \n\nYes, it's a boolean with values 0, 1 and 2 :)\n\nA: Enabling forwarding will wipe out the default route. You can add it back with:\nip -6 route add default via <ipv6 gateway address> dev <interface>\n\nAs soon as it is added, IPv6 connectivity should be fine again.\nIn my case, I had to find the gateway address by snooping around in my cable modem via http://192.168.100.1.\n", "Q: Problem with compiling by G++: why 5/18 returns zero? I have spot an interesting problem in G++:\nwhen I use sin(50*3.14/180) I get something about 0.766,\nhowever sin(5/18*3.24) gives me 0.000.\nIsn't it exacly the same thing? Did anyone spot it before?\nThanks in advance for your answer.\n\nA: That has nothing to do with Ubuntu, but... \nThe reason is that the expression 5/18*3.24 is compiled (in this case precalculated, but alas, the result is the same) as (5/18)*3.24, and interpreted left-to-right.\nNow, (5/18) is an operation between two integers, and returns the integer division between 5 and 18, which is 0 (with remainder 5, but you didn't ask for that). When you multiply 0 and 3.14, the operation is mixed, so (int)0 is promoted to (double)0.0 and the result is, well, 0.0 -- as expected. \nIn the other case, 50*3.14/180, firstly 50*3.14 is computed; (int)50 is promoted to (double)50.0 and all is well. \nMoral: always use the correct format for constants. 5 means (int)5, 5.0 means (double)5.0, 5L means (long int)5, 09 means you don't know C/C++... \nPS as a side note, this behavior is one of the big changes from python2 to python3.

After reboot still the drive is absent. Below is a description of the driver. I need to know if this is the right one for the kernel I have?\n\"DC3x5 is a SCSI host by Tekram which is not supported out of the box by\nthe Linux kernel. This patch adds support for the card to the Linux kernel.\nThe cards supported are DC315 and DC395, both based on the TRM-S1040\nchipset.\nThis package supports 2.2.20 & 2.4.18 kernels. Older and newer 2.2.x and\n2.4.x should work too. It should also work and will attempt to apply to 2.5 and\n2.0 kernel versions\" \nLooks like I have 3.11.0-18-generic kernel so this won't work.\nIdeas?\n\nA: It looks to me like the driver should be available in newer kernels (under the name dc395x), but might not be activated/compiled by default. Does a sudo modprobe dc395x help? According to this, it is the right module for your card.\n\nA: There are a couple options you can try.\n1) Try obtaining a version of the kernel that you can patch. (Set up dual boot at you say Seth suggested in the comments) You can find versions of the kernel in the range your patch specifies here\n2) Migrate your Windows installation to Virtual box\nHow to do either of these approaches is fully documented elsewhere and either approach triggers a different question which has likely been asked and answered long ago.

The only way your home folder would be safe would be if you have your home folder in its own separate partition.\n\nA: You said \"/home partition\", so I'm guessing you mounted /home to a different partition than / (root).  You should be fine.  If you installed / and /home on the same partition, then yes, you will loose all your personal files.\nWhen you're going through the new installation, you'll be able to see your current partitions before commiting to anything.  You'll see what's currently mounted to each partition in the installation partition dialogue.

Yesterday I tried to reinstall Ubuntu to use a lot of the free space I had in my hard drive. I wasn't very smart and I simply formated my old Ubuntu and grub partitions (which only had something like 15 GB) and joined all the free space into a 350 GB partition. I created a USB drive with the recovery image for my Windows 8.1 and proceeded to try to reinstall Ubuntu.\nThat's when everything went down the drain. Before reinstalling Ubuntu, I've tried running the Windows 8.1 recovery tools. When I tried to refresh my system, it required me to insert the recovery media, which I didn't understand, as I was already running it from my recovery media.\nI got desperate and copied all the files from the Recovery USB drive into another machine and created a new Ubuntu live USB. I reinstalled Ubuntu into my free space, but now Windows is not recognized anymore. Grub shows up, but there's no Windows option. There is some Windows Recovery Option, but all it does is go back to grub. Ubuntu finds the Windows partition, and I can actually access all my files from it. But I cannot boot Windows from that partition. I still have a recovery tools partition that came with my laptop too, but I'm not being able to boot it or run it.\nI know I did lots of stupid I stuff. I didn't backup my Windows partition, I have overwritten my recovery USB drive with my Ubuntu image. But now the deed is done. I will be more careful. But, as I can access all my Windows files from Ubuntu, I think there's still some hope to recover Windows.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: How to Recover Your Windows Bootloader in Ten to Fifeteen Easy Steps\nWow, bud, you messed up.  Good news, though, there's an easy fix after which you can start laughing at yourself.  I can already laugh because I've done worse.  So, welcome to the club. 8D\nI've had to do most of this very recently.  It seems like a lot of steps at first, but you probably know most of this already.  Don't panic, none of it is hard, and there're loads of resources online.\nWhat you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair windows' boot loader.  This should get you into windows, even if it can't see your ubuntu partition.\n\n*Do all the backing up you should have in the first place and recreate your recovery media (if you can).\n\n*Boot into your Ubuntu Live CD/USB.  Repair its bootloader (grub2) and run a customizer tool to properly detect and include Windows in its bootloader.\n\n\nThis will work most of the time.  If ubuntu's installation or boot-recovery still can't detect your windows partition, you won't be able to dual boot without making some changes.  Decide which OS you want for now and work on those changes when you're comfortable.\nWhat you'll need to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*A windows 8/8.1 installation media. (See below) Put this on a disc or usb.\n\n*Free software to create your windows 8/8.1 installation media.  (See below)\n\n*A product key.  You won't be installing Windows, so you might not even need this to use the recovery tools.  If you don't have yours handy (and it's hard to find with OEM installations), you can use a \"generic\" key.  I won't post it here but google will find it for you.  It's perfectly legit; you can't activate an installation using a \"generic\" key.\n\n*A Ubuntu Live USB, on it you'll want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot-Repair comes standard on Ubuntu's live media.  It's pretty easy to use comes standard on it, but if not it's easy to install.\n\n*Grub Customizer will help you scan for Windows and edit your grub2 bootloader.  I prefer terminal commands, but this gui tool is great.\n\n\n\nGetting a Windows 8/8.1 Installation Media\nThis is the only hard part.  Microsoft used to make ISO files for their installation media available, but they no longer do for 8/8.1. If you know anyone who has one, or even has an OEM recover disc for a different computer, borrow it. They should both boot into its recovery mode.  Otherwise, you're stuck looking for an ISO in all the usual ways.  I found this article helpful in this regard: How to download and install Windows 8.1 for free\nPut the Windows 8/8.1 onto a USB\nThis should be easy for you, you've already done it for Ubuntu and other distributions as well.  The Windows Installer program for Windows 7 works for Windows 8/8.1 as well.  Life Hacker has a good article on it.\nWindows Recovery\nBoot into the Windows installation media you borrowed or created.  Choose the recovery \"Advanced Options\" until it offers you a command prompt or shell.  I'm not sure if you want \"bootrec /fixmbr\" or \"bootrec /fixboot\".  They both worked for me.  How To Fix The Windows Bootloader\nBoot Windows - Yay!\nHopefully you have a new boot loader that gets you into windows.  Do your backups, see if you can recreate your recovery media, and find your Windows Product Key.  Keep it on a piece of paper, OS installers rarely eat paper.\nUse Ubuntu to Scan for Windows and Creat a Dual-Boot Bootloader\nI was never happy with the way the Windows bootloader handles a linux os, so I stick with Ubuntu's grub2.  It is possible with EasyBCD, but I didn't like its results.  Log into ubunty, open a terminal and type \"boot-repair\".  More on boot repair.\nAdd Windows to Grub2\nI don't remember if boot-repair will look for your windows installation.  Grub Customizer is good at scanning.  Its tabs and menus are easy to understand.  There's an \"Rescan OS\" tool that will be helpful.\nThat's it!\nIf all goes well, you've got both of your operating systems on Grub's bootloader, you've configured which one you want as default, and life is good.\n\nStill Can't Find Windows?\nIf Ubuntu's installation or boot-recovery tools still can't find Windows on your hard dirves, Windows might be using a type of partition table that linux can't see.  I don't know enough about it to be explaining anything, but you'll want to convert your partition table to \"mbr\".  (Used to be standard on Windows.)  Once you're sure you have a \"mbr partiton table\", linux and grub should find your windows easily.\nI found these two articles helpful:\nThe Differences Between MBR and GPT\n Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk\n\nWant to Try Windows' Bootloader Instead of Grub?\nLike I said, this isn't as hard as it sounds.  I gave it a try, but ended up preferring Grub2.  Ubuntu Geek has a good article on it.\n\nGood Luck!\nAfter this, you'll be a bootloader pro and feel more comfortable screwing up your partitions in the future.  Good luck!  \n\nNew Info - BIOS Settings\nHey, I saw in your comment below that you mentioned EFI firmware configurations.  Have you, or are you able to enter your bios settings and disable UEFI and/or Secure Boot?  I wasn't able to even boot from a LiveUSB until I did that and enabled Legacy Boot.  All this is done in the bios settings.  I figured you're past that, 'cause you got Ubuntu installed.\nI don't know enough to advise you, and different hardware will have different access to settings.  If you think this might be an issue:  UEFI - Community Help\nWindows Fast Boot\nOnce you get into Windows, you'll want to find and disable \"Fast Boot\".  Fast boot stores info same as powering-down into hibernation mode.  I can't think how Fast Boot would be directly causing your problem, but if nothing else, it's a \"best practice\" suggestion to help out down the line.\nMore info on Fast Boot and Dual Booting Ubuntu\n\nA: Try running:\nsudo update-grub\nto see if it picks up the Windows partition and adds it to the boot menu.\nIf all the regular system folders are present in the Windows partition (Windows, System32, etc.) then it should be recoverable if grub will pick it up and point to the partition.\n", "Q: How does Wine (windows programme loader) work on Ubuntu? I know that we can run windows (.exe) programs with the help of Wine.\nI want to know how Wine works and runs .exe programs on Ubuntu. As they're two different operating systems - Windows (closed source) and Ubuntu (Linux open-source) - and they work differently: Ubuntu is based on package management (e.g. apt,dpkg).\nWhy is Wine important and what does it mean by \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\"?\nAs I know it creates ~/.wine/drive_c/windows etc. directories. Does it work similarly to Windows and USE the same files in windows/system32 as a real Windows platform?\nI want to know the working and importance of it, because why it is projected (what is need/why it should allow to) to run Windows programs on Ubuntu? However it is not fully supporting all Windows software and graphics.\nAnd what are parallel packages like 'Cross-Over' and 'Play on Linux'?\n\nA: As says wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)\n\n\"Wine is a compatibility layer. It duplicates functions of Windows by providing alternative implementations of the DLLs that Windows programs call,[4] and a process to substitute for the Windows NT kernel.\"\n\nSo, WINE is set of in-house developed libraries, one side of which (visible to programs) is the Windows API, and the other side (visible to linux kernel and linux libraries, like glibc and libX11) is POSIX, Linux and X11 API. Also, there is special loader of windows programs which can read EXE file, load it and all needed DLL libraries to the memory, connect everything with internal Wine libraries and system libraries and run it. There can be several helper programs inside WINE too.\n\nAs there is two different operating system windows (closed source) and Ubuntu (Linux open-source)\n\nWine provides its own versions of various Window system DLLs. Wine also has the ability to load native Windows DLLs. Attempting to call into the Windows kernel directly is unsupported. If your Windows program makes calls that Linux can handle, then Wine passes them on to the Linux kernel. If the program wants to do something that Linux can't do, then Wine translates the call into something that Linux can deal with first.\nBoth OSs (Windows and Ubuntu) have different APIs (and ABIs (Application Binary Interface)). Windows has WinAPI, and Linux has POSIX API, with some additional Linux-specific APIs, graphics APIs (like X11) and with its own Linux ABI.  Different APIs don't let you, for example, open the file, and read from it, if you are using wrong API. This difference is not about package management, but about interfacing between programs, libraries, and OS kernels.\n\nThen Why wine is important and what means by \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\"?\n\nAn emulator should load program instructions, parse them, and imitate their actions. So, emulators of ARM are possible on x86 (Intel). For example, there is the great qemu (name decoded as \"Quick EMUlator\"), or an older x86 emulator written in C - bochs. Emulators usually emulate an entire PC, starting from the BIOS, processors and HDDs, and they boot into the OS you install on this virtual PC.\nWINE is not an emulator because it doesn't interpret instructions of target binary or simulate processors. It just loads a program into memory and provides an API translation from WinAPI to the host's POSIX/Linux APIs (and Xlib for graphics and mouse, and some other API for sound, etc).\n\nwhy it is projected (or what is need/why it should allow to) to run windows programmes on Ubuntu? \n\nWINE was projected much before Ubuntu was created, the project was started in 1993 after Solaris's similar project \"Wabi\". It is useful to have the capability to start applications that are made to run on another OS, especially if this other OS is used widely, and has a lot of software (and games) created exclusively for it which can't be started directly from any other OS like Unix, Solaris or Linux.\n\nHowever it is not fully supports several software of windows and graphics.\n\nWINE can't have the exact implementation of all WinAPI (some parts of it are undocumented) and all needed libraries. Some Windows programs are using APIs or libraries which are not implemented, so they can't work with WINE.\n\nAnd what is parallel packages like cross-over,play on linux?\n\nCrossover is commercial variant of WINE with better support, some helper GUI tools (to easy install some software) and verified compatibility list of working windows programs and games. Usually you should pay some (40 US$) money to CodeWeavers, developers of CrossOver, in order to use the package for long time and have support. CodeWeavers (small company) supports wine project, by resending all patches to it, and by paying to several wine developers. According to wikipedia:\n\n\"CrossOver is developed by CodeWeavers, based on Wine, an open-source Windows compatibility layer. CodeWeavers modifies the Wine source code, applies compatibility patches, adds configuration tools that are more user-friendly, and provides technical support. CodeWeavers employs several Wine software developers, and contributes source code to Wine.\"\n\n", "Q: upgrade to 14.04 added lightdm to server edition The update from 13.10 to 14.04 using do-release-upgrade seems to have added lightdm to my computer.

After talking to the Pixel Qi company, it seams like the screen I got was a fake one, so be careful when ordering off ebay.\n\nA: I don't have one of these yet, but my understanding is that dimming it completely should simply leave the black and white e-ink display.\nDid you buy the display separately?  If so which laptop did you put it in?  Or, did you in fact buy the sunbook?\nAnyway, perhaps you are actually changing the contrast instead of brightness.  My suggestion would be to run the following command in a terminal:\nfind /sys -name \"bright*\"\n\nThis should return a few files, including something like\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:01:00.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness. If you read the file (cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:01:00.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness) it should give the current brightness (mine says '8'), and you can turn brightness completely off by doing:\necho 0 | sudo tee -a /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:01:00.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nThen obviously you can reset it by doing:\necho 8 | sudo tee -a /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:01:00.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nHopefully that will get you what you want.

Is there any way to resolve this?\n\nA: These two commands worked for me:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloads/partial/*\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nsource: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/msttcorefonts/+bug/1371783\n\nA: This worked like a charm:\nFirst, you need to delete everything related to msttcorefonts. Then this:\nwget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/contrib/m/msttcorefonts/ttf-mscorefonts-installer_3.6_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i ttf-mscorefonts-installer_3.6_all.deb\nsudo fc-cache -f -v\n\nIt works too in Linux Mint 18 :)\n\nA: The ttf-mscorefonts-installer package allows for easy installation of the Microsoft True Type Core Fonts for the web.\nRun sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer and accept the EULA, or else if you already have ttf-mscorefonts-installer installed and you didn't accept the EULA, then uninstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer and reinstall it like this:  \nsudo dpkg -P ttf-mscorefonts-installer  \nsudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer  \n\nUse the Tab and Enter keys to accept the EULA in the Microsoft TrueType core fonts window that pops up. The terminal will output a new message each time it finishes downloading a new font. Wait a bit until the terminal tells you that it's finished downloading and installing the Microsoft TrueType core fonts.  \n\nAs noted in package ttf-mscorefonts-installer 3.4+nmu1ubuntu2 fails to install/upgrade, the current 3.4 version of ttf-mscorefonts-installer searches for the font files in an incorrect network location. The consequence of this is that the core fonts are never installed. This problem occurs with Ubuntu 16.04 as of July, 2016. Current to October 11, 2017 the latest version of ttf-mscorefonts-installer is also 3.4 in Ubuntu 16.10 and Ubuntu 17.04 and the latest version of ttf-mscorefonts-installer is 3.6 in Ubuntu 17.10.\nThe Debian (upstream) version 3.6 of ttf-mscorefonts-installer searches for the font files in the correct network location, and will successfully install the core fonts. For more information about this fix see Failure to download extra data files - ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nA: Here's a work-around until the package is fixed:\nTMP=`mktemp -d`   \ncd $TMP\ngrep Url: /usr/share/package-data-downloads/ttf-mscorefonts-installer | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -n 1 wget  \nsudo /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts $TMP/*  \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ttf-mscorefonts-installer  \ncd -  \nrm -rf $TMP\n\nNote that this does skip the hash sum check, but they're just fonts, It's not like someone's going to hijack the download.sourceforge.net DNS and use it to distribute invalid files. The files aren't being executed: the update-ms-fonts script uses cabextract to pull the TTF files out of each exe.\nAnyway, hope this helps.\n\nA: I was getting hashsum errors from arial32.exe package and the install would fail, but utilizing a combination of the two above me, this actually worked.\nsudo dpkg -P ttf-mscorefonts-installer\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloads/partial/*\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\n\nA: 16.04 is affected by a download bug\nMore details in the bug report. As a workaround, download the revised Debian package and install it.\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/contrib/m/msttcorefonts/ttf-mscorefonts-installer_3.6_all.deb\nsudo gdebi ~/Downloads/ttf-mscorefonts-installer_3.6_all.deb\n\n", "Q: How to fix GTK theme for Nemo's pathbar breadcrumbs and disk free space barchart I like a few features of Nemo, but there seems to be a theme problem - at least when running under Ubuntu Gnome 14.04:\nAs you can see from this screenshot:\n\nit's not possible to see which of the breadcrumbs is selected, and the barchart for available space seems to be colouring both full and free the same colour!\nIn the screenshot I have the \"global dark theme\" on, but it's the same problem without this.\n\nA: I installed Nemo from the Mint packaged for Ubuntu archives. This updated it, made some more nemo-* packages available and fixed the breadcrumbs, but I was left with the useless disk space indicators. Here's how I fixed those:\nCreate your own GTK+3 theme as follows\nFirst, duplicate the Adwaita theme with the name Adwaita-custom\n$ cd /usr/share/themes\n$ sudo bash  # easier than prepending every line with sudo...\n# cp -ar Adwaita Adwaita-custom\n# cd Adwaita-custom\n# sed -i 's/Adwaita/Adwaita-custom/' index.theme\n\nNow we add special CSS for Nemo\n# cd gtk-3.0\n# echo '@import url(\"apps/nemo-custom.css\");' >>gtk.css\n# mkdir apps\n# $EDITOR apps/nemo-custom.css*\n\nNow in that file, here's what I put:\n/* For Places Sidebar diskfull indicators */\n\nNemoPlacesTreeView {\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-bg-color: #d9d9d9;\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-fg-color: #4a90d9 ;\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-bar-width: 2px;\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-bar-radius: 1px;\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-bottom-padding: 1px;\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-max-length: 70px;\n}\n\nNemoPlacesTreeView:selected {\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-bg-color: #d9d9d9;\n    -NemoPlacesTreeView-disk-full-fg-color: shade(#4a90d9,0.5) ;\n}\n\nSave and exit your editor. You can now drop root privileges, too, and/or exit your terminal shell.\nNow select Adwaita-custom as the GTK+ theme in the tweak tool (\"Advanced Settings\") app.\nHere's mine now:\n\nPS.

I am able to use tty. This is a much simpler way to update to the latest nvidia drivers than the method you are currently using.\nThe commands below are for the latest beta drivers, if you want the latest stable branch instead of the beta, just replace \"337\" with \"334\"--both officially support the 750 Ti.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-337\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-337-uvm\n\nPPA info here: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\nand here: http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/xorg-edgers\nThe \"umbrella\" package is called nvidia-graphics-drivers-337\nNote that this PPA will upgrade multiple Ubuntu packages related to X. If you choose to remove the PPA or upgrade the distro, you will probably want to run ppa-purge first--as noted on the Launchpad page.\nWhen using the xorg-edgers PPA,you will also receive automatic updates to the nvidia driver series you selected--usually in just a few days after their release.\n", "Q: Cannot uninstall TrueCrypt I installed TrueCrypt from their website (.tar.gz file) extracted through the archive manager to /usr/share/truecrypt.

If that data needs to\n  be read in the future, it is already in storage. Cache is a mechanism\n  to avoid doing real I/O operations as real I/O to a disk is very slow\n  compared to just retrieving it from memory. So a high cache number is\n  generally good and nothing to be concerned with.\n\nSo, no you can't know which programs or processes are in cache, becasue there are no such items there.\nWhat you can find there is cached I/O, and as @bseiblod mentioned in his comment, you can find a solution to that here: How can you tell whether a file is being cached in memory in linux?\n", "Q: Is there any way for assigning external metadata to files?

If you're behind a router, set your Wireless network connection for IPv4 Automatic DHCP, set it so it needs IPv4 to complete the connection, then set the IPv6 for the time being to Ignore.\nI have seen this in terms of some cable and xDSL companies assign a modem both an IPv4 and IPv6 address but it isn't brought inwards as of yet from the modem, so that everything on your network doesn't have an IPv6 IP address, despite having your router set as IPv6 bridge or pass through, it has no effect.\nIf this is the case, you will get IPv6 as \"link local\", meaning a loop-back virtual device is created for you in this case. It serves no purpose if this is what's happening. I tell people to turn IPv6 off by using \"Ignore\" in the Network Setting panel or via console / terminal.\nIf you're able to connect via IPv4 to your network and Internet after you have this selected, try doing an update. If it works, go to the Network Connection panel and enable IPv6 as DHCP Automatic but leave IPv4 enabled. If you connection slows down and you try to get an update again, which then slows to a crawl, cancel the update.\nThen disable IPv6 again as \"Ignore\". I see this in a handful of cases every couple of months.\nIn Microsoft Windows, by default IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled and the IPv4 DHCP starts up first then IPv6 is brought up, very rarely have I seen an actual IPv6 connection through a residential gateway, meaning your computer is assigned an IPv6 address from your ISP directly, not just a link-local and loop-back device.\n", "Q: How to check if a ttf file contains a certain character?

And in the process the disks hibernate along with it and become unaccessible by other operating systems. That is why you get that long message. To prevent this, when windows 8 boots(i.e. after your problem is fixed) type \"lid\" in search and then choose \"change what closing the lid does\". Then unselect \"turn on fast startup\" and then reboot your laptop. You should now be able to access your hard disks from ubuntu.

You can do a successful graphical login with other accounts. This suggests a problem with a config file in your home directory, possibly your session file.\nTry logging in to the account through the terminal and do:\n mv ~/.config/xfce4{,.bak}\n\nThis will move your XFCE config  to a temporary  location. Now try logging in again. \nIf that does not fix the issue, there is another option that will fix any login problem caused by a misbehaving home directory. Login again at the terminal and do:\nmkdir ~/bak\nmv ~/.* ~/* ~/bak\n\nTry logging in again. It should now work (we know this should work, because you can already successfully login as another user - all we are doing here is resetting your home directory to a fresh user state). \nNow take your files and config in the ~/bak directory and mv anything that you want in your home directory back there.

Recently, I bought a Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse. While I am very happy with it overall, one issue is nagging me. Every so often, the mouse will experience a input lag, so movement is jumpy instead of smooth. This can be very annoying when I need to perform precise movements.\nAfter some searching, I have found two possible causes of my problem.\n\n*\n\n*The GPU is performing intensive operations. This is unlikely, since it has happened during general usage and my GPU (Geforce GTS 620) can handle operations such as watching videos very well.\n\n*There is interference in my the Logitech Unifying Receiver's frequency band. This seems the much more likely problem, so I have performed some former research.\n\nAfter a look on Wikipedia, I verified the receiver uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band. However, the spec seems to suggest it jumps between frequencies in its band like Bluetooth, which makes it hard to verify whether this is the cause of my problem.\nAfter a look at the frequencies used by nearby WiFi networks, I have found that two are in the 2.4 GHz range as well. Below is the output of sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep Frequency | sort | uniq -c | sort -n.\n1                     Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)\n3                     Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)\n\nI am by no means an expert in wireless networking, but this does seem to help verify my theory that the receiver is in fact experiencing interference because it is jumping to these frequencies.\nI can also verify that my USB WiFi adapter is adjacent to my receiver's USB port, which could be causing some problems as well. The WiFi adapter only supports the 2.4 GHz band, sadly, so preventing interference that way would be problematic, since I would be limited to jumping USB ports. Below is the output of iwlist wlan0 channel.\nwlan0     14 channels in total; available frequencies :\n          Channel 01 : 2.412 GHz\n          Channel 02 : 2.417 GHz\n          Channel 03 : 2.422 GHz\n          Channel 04 : 2.427 GHz\n          Channel 05 : 2.432 GHz\n          Channel 06 : 2.437 GHz\n          Channel 07 : 2.442 GHz\n          Channel 08 : 2.447 GHz\n          Channel 09 : 2.452 GHz\n          Channel 10 : 2.457 GHz\n          Channel 11 : 2.462 GHz\n          Channel 12 : 2.467 GHz\n          Channel 13 : 2.472 GHz\n          Channel 14 : 2.484 GHz\n          Current Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)\n\nSo, my question is, is it possible to change the frequency band of my receiver? If so, how? If anybody can come up with a better solution, please feel free to provide that as an answer as well.\n\nA: I have this problem often as well. It could be rf noise from other wireless devices, but also USB3.0 causes RF noise that influences the unifying receivers of logitech.\nAside from moving the receiver with a USB hub, cable, different USB port, what sometimes helps for me is unpairing my mouse from the receiver, and re-pairing it. It seems to me that the frequency used between the receiver and the periferal is chosen when you pair it. I'm not sure if this is true, but it does seem to help for me. On linux you can do this with the package solaar. It is a GUI that lives in the system tray that shows you the periferals paired to your unifying receiver and allows you to unpair and pair periferals. Often when I do this (hurray for touchpads....) the mouse stops skipping.\n\nA: It seems that a solution to my problem was to move my USB WiFi adapter away from my Unifying Receiver. To do this, I plugged a USB extender into a USB hub, then plugged the adapter into the hub. The hub itself is unnecessary, but it seems to do the trick. I recognize that this is not an Ubuntu-specific solution, but can judge from peoples responses that it is impossible to change the Unifying Receiver's frequency range. Since my wifi adapter only supports the 2.4 GHz frequency range, this then meant that the only way to prevent interference was to move them apart.\n\nA: As far as I know there's no way to change neither the frequency nor the channel that Logitech Unifying receivers use, but you can try changing the channel of the WiFI router instead.\nAlternatively use an extender USB cable, and don't forget to check your mouse batteries in fact low batteries might result in similar problems.\nTo find a free WiFi channel I recommend \"WiFi Analyzer\" by farproc available for Android devices, it's a must have.\n\nA: I had the same issue with a Logitech wireless keyboard. My mobile phone was interfering with the connection causing the keyboard to stop working.\nAfter some research, I discovered that turning the keyboard off and then on again forces the receiver to choose the best available frequency. \nI tried this and now have my phone sitting right next to my keyboard without any issues at all. \nSo, turn it off and on again seems like the best advice I can give :)\n\nA: I began having the same issue on my new ASUS super-computer. It was wrecking my joy of the lightening-speeds of a Gen 10, i9 system. Then I noticed that the computer next to me was responding to my trackball also. I unplugged the receiver from the other computer and it solved the problem. Apparently the trackball was getting a reply from two receivers, thereby confusing it. If I cannot figure out how to change the frequency of one of them, I may have to go to a wired trackball.\n\nA: I had this experience on a windows machine and I readily admit it might not be relevant to a Linux based system, but here it goes with the hope it helps.\nThe issue in my case was the video driver. I naturally thought it was the mouse or the frequency, but after a lot of work with the hardware vendor (all in one PC), the operating system support person told me to look at the video driver. He pointed out that when we went into safe mode the mouse issue was gone, using the same mouse driver in safe and normal mode.\nThe video driver vendor wasn't helpful at all, but I found out an update was applied to my PC which had changed the video driver. Once i reverted that change, my issue was gone. Funny enough a few months later, I accidentally clicked on OK when asked to upgrade the video driver and ended up with the same issue.\nShort and sweet, don't rule out the video driver either.\n\nA: USB 3.0 can cause interference in the 2.4GHz ISM band: both the port and the cables. You could try shielding the port, but that may not be practical. Another possibility is to plug the dongle into a USB2.0 extension and set it away from the computer (and wifi antennae too).\nIntel has a white paper that discusses this issue in depth.

However, if when the Page is open instead of hitting the Back button from the toolbar I choose another tab, it totally confuses the toolbar, which then no longer shows the Back button.\nIs there a way to make my pages full screen, so that the header with the name of the current tab is not shown (and thus cannot be tapped), or even better, to show the title of the current page in the header instead of the parent tab title?\nTabs {\n    id: tabs\n\n    Tab {\n            objectName: \"tabQreator\"\n            title: i18n.tr(\"Create\")\n            page: CreatorPage {\n                id: pageCreator\n            }\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nAnd on CreatorPage.qml:\nPageStack {\n    id: pageStack\n\n    anchors {\n        fill: parent\n    }\n\n    Component.onCompleted: push(pageRoot)\n\n    Page {\n        id: somePage\n\n        // Toolbar definition here...\n    }\n\n    Page {\n        id: pageRoot\n        title: i18n.tr(\"The root page\")\n        visible: false\n        // ...\n\n    }\n\n\nA: Credit goes to Szymon Waliczek, who answered this on G+.

Any ideas?\n\nA: First of all, don't use sudo for this. This can cause permissions issues and, when used in combination with x which extracts the archive with the full path, might result in inadvertently overwriting important system files. Instead, just use unrar x file.rar.\nNow, the error you are getting is most likley because you have saved the file in directory X but are running the command from directory Y. For example, you have saved the file in /home/superpajamarama/Downloads and are running the command from /home/superpajamarama/.\nTo avoid this kind of thing, always use tab completion for file names in the terminal. Start typing the name of the file, and then hit tab:\nunrar x file<TAB>\n\nThat will give you the possible completions and will let you know that the file is there.  \nAnyway, you need to either move into the correct directory, for example:\ncd /home/superpajamarama/Downloads\nunrar x filename.rar\n\nOr give the full path to the file:\nunrar x /home/superpajamarama/Downloads/filename.rar\n\n\nIn your case, the problem is that your path has a space in it.

First, make sure you have this line:\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nThat will block root access. You can then allow it for your local network with this:\n## Permit local root login\nMatch Address 192.168.1.*,127.0.0.1\n      PermitRootLogin yes\n\nThis assumes that your LAN gives IPs like 192.168.1.N, if not, change accordingly. Also, I suggest you add this at the end of /etc/ssh/sshd_config to make sure it does not conflict with other directives. Once you have done so, restart the ssh service (sudo service ssh restart) and you will be able to ssh as root from local machines only.\n\nA: Using this simple iptables rule, you can block the hosts not coming from your local network, my network is 192.168.122.0 so my rule will be:\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 ! -s 192.168.122.0/24 -j DROP\n\nif you want block only a particular user from a source\nin your /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nAllowUsers root@192.168.122.*\n\n\nA: After dealing a lot with this issues I've found that with IP6 interaces you should proably need to add ::1 as localhost origin, even your \"external\" ip address if you depending of your /etc/hosts configuration\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin no\nStrictModes yes\n\n## Permit local root login\nMatch Address ::1,127.0.0.1,178.56.xx.xx\n  PermitRootLogin yes\nMatch All\n\n", "Q: Why is my conky shown above other windows?

In that case you need to add a <layout> element to the list /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml – just look at the other entries.

When installing Ubuntu I unknowingly set my EFI mount to the Windows EFI partition. Now I need to delete windows along with its EFI partition for a fresh install. I already have another partition prepped up to be the Ubuntu EFI boot partition.\nHow do I migrate /boot/efi to that partition?\n\nA: An EFI System Partition (ESP) is simply a FAT32 partition with a GUID type code of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B (or 0xEF on an MBR disk). Most partitioning tools have some other way of displaying the GUID type code, because GUIDs are so cumbersome. In parted, GParted, and most other libparted-based tools, it's shown as a \"boot flag\" being set on the partition. (Note, however, that in libparted-land, the \"boot flag\" on a GPT disk is unrelated to the \"boot flag\" on an MBR disk. AFAIK, libparted provides no way to correctly label an MBR ESP.) In GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk), an ESP has a type code of EF00. Non-Linux tools have their own ways to identify ESPs.\nThus, to create a new ESP, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to any Linux tool that lets you partition the disk. This could be your existing Linux installation or an emergency disk/live CD -- but if you use your regular installation, be aware that you may be limited in what you can do, because many partitioning tools limit what you can do to a disk with partitions that are mounted.\n\n*Launch the partitioning tool of your choice.\n\n*If necessary, create a new partition. I recommend making it at least 550MiB in size. Note that you may need to shrink existing partition(s) to make room.\n\n*Place a FAT32 filesystem on the partition. Some tools, such as GParted, make it possible to combine this step with the previous one.\n\n*Mark said partition as an ESP.\n\n*Unmark or delete the old ESP.\n\n*If necessary, save your changes.\n\n\nFor making partition table changes, there's no need to be concerned with your boot mode -- you can use EFI mode or BIOS mode as you see fit. (That said, some computers make it easier to boot from USB or CD-R in one mode or another.)\nI agree with oldfred that creating a new ESP is unlikely to be necessary in your scenario. If you want to completely erase the Windows boot loader from the ESP, feel free to do so -- it would be the /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft directory tree once Ubuntu is installed. Note that this will not remove the Windows boot loader from the firmware's boot manager menu. To do that, you'll need to use efibootmgr, as in:\n$ sudo efibootmgr \nTimeout: 10 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0004,0001,0002\nBoot0000* rEFInd boot manager\nBoot0001* PATA: HP DVD Writer 1040r     \nBoot0002* SATA: ST32000542AS             2\nBoot0003* SATA: TOSHIBA DT01ACA300       3\nBoot0004* Windows boot manager\nBoot0008* INTERNAL EFI SHELL: ST32000542AS\n$ sudo efibootmgr -B -b 4\n\nThis example deletes boot option #4, which is identified as \"Windows boot manager.\" (I don't recall the name that Windows uses by default; I edited this example from one of my systems on which Windows is not installed.)\n\nA: Try using the Ubuntu's disk manager before installing it. Allow bios to be in CSM boot mode before installing \"try ubuntu\", disks, click on the partition needed format, leave blank or you can format to ext2. Restart, bios back to UEFI boot mode, install should work fine.\n\nA: Using a bootable USB flash drive with your version of Linux installed including Gparted.\nBoot from the flash drive by accessing boot order in your BIOS.  \nOn my Asus laptop, the Aptio BIOS, it was necessary to disable FastBoot and SecureBoot before the BIOS would enable Flash drive booting as an option.\nOnce you can boot from USB, run your Distro with the \"Try Ubuntu\" option.  Now that you are running from the Flash Drive, using Gparted to manage your partitions is fairly straightforward.\nUsing Gparted while logged in on your HDD Distro is risky.\n\nA: On my HP p066us laptop, I have to set the efi boot order in the BIOS, which takes precedence over settings in the efi boot partition.  If edits using the efibootloader program don't work for you, you may have to look through your BIOS settings.  \n", "Q: How can I keep something running but run other terminal commands? I'm sure this is a really stupid question and it's probably already been asked a dozen times on this site, and I just don't know which keywords to search. I'm still really new to managing a server and new to the command line in general, but it's something I've been wanting to try for a long time.\nRight now I have Ubuntu Server (no GUI) running a Node.js web server.\nHow can I keep Node running while executing other commands on the command line?\nFor example:\nnode /var/www/my_app.js\nThis command prevents me from running other commands until I terminate it with Ctrl + C. But what if I want to run a redis-cli command while leaving Node running in the background? In other words:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I exit out of the Node.js context without stopping the Node server? and\n\n*After I do (1), how can I return to the Node context?\n\n\nI don't know if (2) makes sense for the node command, but, for example, if I ran nodemon instead, I can run a rs (restart) command while nodemon is running.\nThanks, and apologies if this is a duplicate and/or really obvious question.\n\nA: The suggested (setsid, et al) are great if you're just firing something off and don't care about its longevity but in production you'd use a proper daemon system to monitor and respawn a server process. Ubuntu ships with Upstart so I'd look at writing an Upstart script.\nSave something like this to somewhere like /etc/init/mynodeapp.conf:\ndescription \"My node.js app\"\n\nstart on startup\nstop on shutdown\nrespawn\n\nexec sudo -u USER /usr/bin/node /var/www/my_app.js\n\nReplace USER in the exec line with whatever user you want to be running, and make sure the path to the node binary is full and correct (which node will help confirm). If you're using a locally installed version, make sure it points there.\nOnce that's in order, sudo start mynodeapp will start it, sudo stop mynodeapp will stop it and various other upstart commands (restart, status, etc) will do whatever they are designed to do. If you don't want it to start on boot, just comment out the start line with a #.\n\nThat's how I'd do it in production.... You mention wanting to \"return to the Node context\"... That's a bit harder. Upstart and even the other process reparenting techniques all detach you from the process. There's usually no going back to the lit firework.\nIf you have an ongoing process that you need to tend to, it's probably your terminal session you want to look at changing. If I really needed what you're suggesting, I'd start looking at screen. This allows you to have multiple hanging terminals that you can detatch and reattach from and to respectively.\nIt's not a simple application to master but one that might be worth digging into:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html\n", "Q: Issues with installing Splashtop Streamer, (Beta) I'm new to Ubuntu and this forum too, so sorry if I break any posting rules or asking a stupid question.\nI'm trying to install Splashtop Streamer, on Ubuntu 14.04, However I get the following error message.\nPackage dependencies cannot be resolved\n\nThis error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable.

I really suggesty you read it.\n\nA: Have you tried adding the mount command to /etc/rc.local ?  /etc/rc.local is a file that is executed by root at boot time and normally doesn't do anything.  However you can edit it and add your own stuff.  Just make sure that you move the \"exit 0\" command that's already in there down below the commands you want it to execute.\nThat's how I auto-mount my USB connected external at boot.  Just make a mount point with:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/foo\nWhere foo is whatever name you want to give it.  Then edit /etc/rc.local and add the mount command on a line anywhere above the exit command.  Just be aware that when mounted this way, most desktop environments in my experience no longer detect it as an external device, so you won't have the fancy little icon, you'll actually have to navigate to and bookmark /mnt/foo in order to browse the drive.\nI started auto-mounting mine with rc.local after having all sorts of issues editing fstab.

Just curious to know: how does mounting (or unmounting) a partition affect the performance of the system? \nI have a fairly large partition where have stored backups, software and old files that I don't need to access unless I rarely happen to. But I have set this partition to auto-mount at start-up along with other partitions.

I have a 2 TB external that stays mounted all the time and I haven't noticed any ill effects on my system.  I just have it set to spin down when it's not being accessed so it doesn't wear out.

Boot from it, choose \"Try Ubuntu\" and then mount your installed system's drive. For example, if the / drive of your installed system is /dev/sda1, you would want to do\nsudo mkdir /mnt/oldroot\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/oldroot\n\nOnce you have done that, you should be able to navigate to the /etc/rcX.d directories and delete the relevant links. These directories (one for each runlevel) conatin links to scripts located in /etc/init.d. So, once you've removed the links, you may as well go and remove the script that you created in the /etc/init.d directory.\nOnce you've done that, reboot and you should be OK.\n", "Q: Very misleading install options for installing alongside Windows My laptop came installed with wiwndows 8 in UEFI boot. I had installed Debian (in legacy boot mode) a while back. It all worked fine except for the need to switch boot modes every time I changed my setup. \nToday I decided that Ubuntu was better suited for me and tried to replace my Debian/windows dual boot with a Ubuntu/windows dual boot.\nI set up an USB drive with the right ISO and started the process. I booted on the USB drive (in EFI mode) and started the install. When I was asked if I wanted to install alongside Debian or instead of Debian I chose the later since I thought this would leave windows alone.\nI was SO WRONG! It formatted my whole hard drive and now I only have the brand new Ubuntu partition. I insist that Debian and Windows were both working fine. I know there is no way back and I should have been more careful, so my question is:\nShouldn't there have been mention of windows in this (oh so fatidic) page of the assistant?\nI would almost have expected the assistant to detect windows and not Debian since it was setup in legacy and the USB drive booted on UEFI but the reverse seems to have happened.\nAnyway I learned my lesson: no more letting an assistant \"manage\" my partitions...\n\nA: As mentioned in Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI you might have suffered from several issues mainly:\n\n\n*\n\n*No partition/space left for Ubuntu to install. You saw Debian because it was not EFI installed. Since Windows was installed with EFI and there was no space left, the real option you should have seen would be \"Format the whole drive and install Ubuntu\". But since Debian was seeing, it chose that one.\n\n*The correct step in this problem would have been to first eliminate Debian from within Windows using the Windows partition tool. Leaving with this an empty partition for Ubuntu to install in. This is basically setting the system so it looks like Windows 8 is all that is in there and an empty partition for the EFI install of Ubuntu to use.\nThere IS a way to go back to what you have before (Windows + Debian) but you need to act quickly and without doing much else with the drive.\nFirst insert the LiveUSB version of Ubuntu and install in it testdisk. You need to be running on EFI mode in order to recover Windows. After installing testdisk go to the terminal and run sudo testdisk and follow the steps provided to search for deleted partitions. It will find several partitions, of which you need to recover the boot partition of Windows and the system one (If not more depending on how Windows was installed).\nThis also happened to me with to a friend and we were able to recover Windows. In his case he had Fedora which he lost. The same for you with Debian. But at least Windows was recovered.\nIn the case it does not boot afterwards please see https://superuser.com/questions/713919/efi-gpt-windows-7-boot-loader-manager-issue-and-grub\n", "Q: Problem with wifi I've been looking here and elsewhere for a long time to fix my wireless issues.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: I experienced this recently whilst playing around with Ubuntu Touch and Android linux containers (lxc). the symptom was my system would hang on the boot-up splash screen (after entering my LUKS passphrase).  \nI fixed this by going into recovery mode and deleting /etc/ureadahead-touch.conf and doing a complete removal in Synaptic of android-tools-adb, android-tools-fastboot lxc-android-config and ubuntu-device-flash.\nFrom the command line the following should work:\nsudo rm  /etc/ureadahead-touch.conf\nsudo apt-get purge android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot lxc-android-config ubuntu-device-flash\n\nI'm not sure which of these was causing the problem, but they were all putting stuff in /etc which may have been causing the problem. After this my system booted up normally. Most likely it was the lxc-android-config stuff causing problems. \nHopefully this will save other people from the same issue in the future.

In my case, the black screen happens when the computer has been left alone for a while and the screen has turned off. While moving the mouse or pressing a key wakes it up, the screen remains black.\nMy workaround is to run an xrandr command that sets up my screen again. In your case, the command would be:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto\n\nIf that does not set up the correct resolution, use this one instead:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1280x800\n\nHowever, that's hard to type on a black screen. So, make a little script that runs this command:\necho -e '#!/bin/bash\\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1280x800` > ~/bin/fix_screen.sh\n\nThe command above will create a file in your $HOME/bin directory (if the directory does not exist, create it with mkdir ~/bin) called fix_screen.

It is not just a layer that translates filenames into offsets on a block device, it is more of a layer that combines a traditional filesystem with LVM and RAID. And like LVM, it has the concept of allocating space on the underlying device, but not actually using it for files. \nA traditional filesystem is divided into files and free space. It is easy to calculate how much space is used or free:\n|--------files--------|                                                |\n|------------------------drive partition-------------------------------|\n\nBtrfs combines LVM, RAID and a filesystem. The  drive is divided into subvolumes, each dynamically sized and replicated:\n|--files--|    |--files--|         |files|         |                   |\n|----@raid1----|------@raid1-------|-----@home-----|metadata|          |\n|------------------------drive partition-------------------------------|\n\nThe diagram shows the partition being divided into two subvolumes and metadata. One of the subvolumes is duplicated (RAID1), so there are two copies of every file on the device. Now we not only have the concept of how much space is free at the filesystem layer, but also how much space is free at the block layer (drive partition) below it. Space is also taken up by metadata. \nWhen considering free space in Btrfs, we have to clarify which free space we are talking about - the block layer, or the file layer? At the block layer, data is allocated in 1GB chunks, so the values are quite coarse, and might not bear any relation to the amount of space that the user can actually use. At the file layer, it is impossible to report the amount of free space because the amount of space depends on how it is used. In the above example, a file stored on the replicated subvolume @raid1 will take up twice as much space as the same file stored on the @home subvolume. Snapshots only store copies of files that have been subsequently modified. There is no longer a 1-1 mapping between a file as the user sees it, and a file as stored on the drive.\nYou can check the free space at the block layer with btrfs filesystem show / and the free space at the subvolume layer with btrfs filesystem df /\n\n# df -h\nFilesystem              Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/sda4_crypt   38G   12G   13M 100% /\n\nFor this mounted subvolume, df reports a drive of total size 38G, with 12G used, and 13M free. 100% of the available space has been used. Remember that the total size 38G is divided between different subvolumes and metadata - it is not exclusive to this subvolume.\n# btrfs filesystem df /\nData, single: total=9.47GiB, used=9.46GiB\nSystem, DUP: total=8.00MiB, used=16.00KiB\nSystem, single: total=4.00MiB, used=0.00\nMetadata, DUP: total=13.88GiB, used=1.13GiB\nMetadata, single: total=8.00MiB, used=0.00\n\nEach line shows the total space and the used space for a different data type and replication type. The values shown are data stored rather than raw bytes on the drive, so if you're using RAID-1 or RAID-10 subvolumes, the amount of raw storage used is double the values you can see here. \nThe first column shows the type of item being stored (Data, System, Metadata). The second column shows whether a single copy of each item is stored (single), or whether two copies of each item are stored (DUP). Two copies are used for sensitive data, so there is a backup if one copy is corrupted. For DUP lines, the used value has to be doubled to get the amount of space used on the actual drive (because btrfs fs df reports data stored, not drive space used). The third and fourth columns show the total and used space. There is no free column, since the amount of \"free space\" is dependent on how it is used.\nThe thing that stands out about this drive is that you have 9.47GiB of space allocated for ordinary files of which you have used 9.46GiB - this is why you are getting No space left on device errors. You have 13.88GiB of space allocated for duplicated metadata, of which you have used 1.13GiB. Since this metadata is DUP duplicated, it means that 27.76GiB of space has been allocated on the actual drive, of which you have used  2.26GiB. Hence 25.5GiB of the drive is not being used, but at the same time is not available for files to be stored in. This is the \"Btrfs huge metadata allocated\" problem. To try and correct this, run btrfs balance start -m /. The -m parameter tells btrfs to only re-balance metadata.\nA similar problem is running out of metadata space. If the output had shown that the metadata were actually full (used value close to total), then the solution would be to try and free up almost empty (<5% used) data blocks using the command btrfs balance start -dusage=5 /. These free blocks could then be reused to store metadata.\nFor more details see the Btrfs FAQs:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I get \"No space left on device\" errors, but df says I've got lots of space\n\n*Btrfs claims I'm out of space, but it looks like I should have lots left.\n\nA: In my case the disk usage would not go down even when I deleted files and snapshots.\nbtrfs balance (data and metadata) did not work with error \"no space left on device\"\nbtrfs balance start -m /\nERROR: error during balancing '/': No space left on device\nThere may be more info in syslog - try dmesg | tail\n\nThe RAID1 showed full usage on both disks even though actual data usage was lower than a third of that.\n# btrfs fi sh\nLabel: none  uuid: 61a20f1a-c133-11e6-964b-d3bac0c48bbd\n    Total devices 2 FS bytes used 153.94GiB\n    devid    1 size 455.76GiB used 455.76GiB path /dev/sda2\n    devid    2 size 455.76GiB used 455.76GiB path /dev/sdb2\n\n\n# btrfs filesystem df /\nData, RAID1: total=452.73GiB, used=151.51GiB\nSystem, RAID1: total=32.00MiB, used=80.00KiB\nMetadata, RAID1: total=3.00GiB, used=2.42GiB\nGlobalReserve, single: total=512.00MiB, used=0.00B\n\nSolution: discard empty chunks, needs no additional space:\nbtrfs balance start -dusage=0 /\n\nbtrfs balance start -musage=0 /\n\nSource: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-balance#ENOSPC\nAlternative: My solution was to shrink the disks See: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/239765/how-to-fix-btrfs-superblock-error-after-resize-shrink-btrfs-couldnt-get-super\nbtrfs filesystem resize 1:430g /\nbtrfs filesystem resize 2:430g /\n\n(commands take time, check syslog to see relocating blocks)\nafter that resize up:\nbtrfs filesystem resize 1:450g /\nbtrfs filesystem resize 2:450g /\n\nAfter that, btrfs balance (metadata) worked again:\nbtrfs balance -m /\n\nThen btrfs balance of the data (relocate data-chunks that have lower than 33% usage):\nbtrfs balance -dusage=33 /\n\n\nA: Credit goes to @ignis and @bain.

How can I prevent these file conflicts/collisions before this even happens?\n\nA: To prevent this with Ubuntu packages you can use apt-file and just run all your package against the file database that can be found using apt-file:\napt-file search -D your_deb_file.deb\n\nThis will require that you have apt-file installed and updated. Then add the package name (and possibly version) to the Break or Conflict fields, in the respective package entries in the control file. That should be enough.\nNow, some would want to replace Ubuntu files with their own, like offering a newer version of the applications, in such cases the best is to use the same debian/ files as the Ubuntu packages.

If I'm correct I believe these keys only handle authentication and I'm interested in trying to setup strong encryption for SSH.\nI believe when the SSH server is installed the keys for encryption are placed in /etc/ssh under names like ssh_host_*_key.

Keep in mind the results would vary slightly based on hardware, but I think in general it would be safe to say that the iso only contains about 3/4 of a full installation, which would make it essentially just a more inclusive version of the net-installer minimal cd.\nFile And Folder List:\nI tried to use ls and diffuse to create a comparative list of all files/folders but it didn't work, because the entries in the outputted txt files don't line up. The idea was that by removing entries found on both lists it would be possible to see which files and folders were unique to the machine given internet access. Perhaps someone with more knowledge of file comparisons can figure out a way to make this approach work? I've added links for the txt files below. \nText File For VM#1 = https://copy.com/J3SRhFAIRXEz\nText File For VM#2 = https://copy.com/AZu11yEX8fPQ\n", "Q: Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 Fresh Install Is Slow/Freezing I installed Ubuntu for the first time today. I dual booted with Windows 7. Windows works just fine, and Ubuntu will load just fine in a timely manner. The problem is the desktop seems slow, my mouse has like a 10 second delay when I move it, making it impossible to really do anything.\nThe first time my screen went all frizzy making me think that this could be a graphics driver issue. Sometimes it doesn't even boot up, the screen freezes with a bunch of white dots on the screen. After several tries, now it doesn't even boot up anymore.\nI'm completely new to Ubuntu and trying to learn my way around it. Any ideas on how I can get it working properly?\n\nA: Here's a link to an Ubuntu help page that should guide you through installing the proprietary drivers for your particular graphics card.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia\nIf the graphical user interface is really just totally un-useable, press CTRL+ALT+F1.  That should put you in a terminal.  If at any time you want to get back out to the GUI, just press CTRL+ALT+F7.  Anyway, once you're in this terminal, you can use the command line to install the appropriate driver with:\nsudo apt-get install driverpackagenamehere\nI see several different packages available, and a few different versions of the driver, so reference the link I posted above to see which one applies to you since you're not sure at the moment of what exact card you have.  I've attached a screenshot of the package names and descriptions in Synaptic on my computer.  The link above also has instructions for manually editing xorg.conf from the command line if you have to.\nSince you're new to Ubuntu, I would really try to suffer through using the GUI method if it's at all possible.\n\nA: I looked and found the exact BIOS your system uses, from what I can tell they do not have an option to boot from USB (even though that HP employee said they do). You could get another tool, download it, boot it from a different disk, which allows you to boot to USB, but I would like to find a simpler solution. \nI am guessing you are probably more comfortable with Windows environment, and I hate to direct you to a tool I haven't used, but you could try doing all your partitioning and mounting of the disk image (burning the .iso onto a drive letter). You could try creating a partition in Windows, then use OSFMount and rename the .iso to .img, then mount it to your new partition. \nI want to stress I am not sure whether this will work, and I would highly recommend if you want to try this way, back up anything you need, write down your reg key for Windows, and make sure you have a disk. \nBefore doing the stuff above.. I see a couple ways of going.\n\n\n*\n\n*You go through the partition, and mounting above, lots of backing up of information, and not guaranteed to work.\n\n*(The one I would suggest) Make a LiveCD of an older version of Ubuntu like 12.04 LTS (5 year support, ends in 2017), then if you want update it to 14.04. I am only suggesting this because 14.04 JUST came out (14 is for the year 2014, April 04). There will be bugs, just like any OS release. It will be a lot easier if you just get a working version, then if need be upgrade from there. \n\n*If you are in love with 14.04 and want to fix it we can go that route, but if you do wish to go that route, I have another question. What do you have in advanced options, when you select it from GRUB. I am used to having a recovery option, but I do not dual boot Windows with my personal computer, but have set up quite a few XP,7,and 8.1. If you have a recovery option, that may be the easiest way to get Ubuntu 14.04 up, if your computer will actually run it.\nThe only reason I wanted to run a live version, is so that we could find out what might be the problem (almost like running Windows in safe mode).\n\nOlder stuff below:\nI do not believe that the first Ubuntu install is correct. Normally it would show a version behind it. I have a strong hunch that the filesquash.fs error is because of the loader trying to extract itself onto itself.. that sounds weird, but I believe that is what the message is saying. \nIf you have no clue what I mean: Basically to me it seems for some reason the LiveCD is trying to install on top of itself. I am not sure what the issue is exactly, just save the disk there may be no problem with it, but if you have a spare, you can always try a different disk. I know you followed the instructions by using a native Windows 7 program, but I am going to direct you to a different way of using a bootable USB. (Less expense if you mess it up accidentally, just redo, not use a new disk.) \nHow to create a bootable USB stick on Windows. \n\nI looked up your motherboard, because I wanted to double-check that you could not boot from USB (it just seemed odd because most newer Motherboards let you boot from a USB). It looks like you can as per an HP employee, you just need to make sure that you have a bootable USB in your drive when booting up. \n(Mobo Spec Link) Just in case you wanted to check too.\nUse a spare flash drive, if you have one. It is 2GB minimum for the bootable USB but I chose to use a higher capacity and speed one (USB 3.0), because that's how I roll. \nIf you can get this to work (hopefully), you are going to need to know how to install/partition and mount. You can look through the Ubuntu installation guide to figure it out, just know that it may be easier for you to partition a drive in Windows (unformatted) prior to installing Ubuntu. \nThe reasons why: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu could overwrite something (probably not though unless you install over top)\n\n*Windows could get mad at Ubuntu, and try to 'fix' itself.\n\n*It is cleaner, and easier if you are used to Windows.\n\n*You could partition incorrectly with Gparted if you don't know what you are doing.\n\nI need to make food for my wife right now. I will come back later to see if there has been any progress and if this has been helpful.\n\n\nYes I am willing to help. I am doing this outside of the comments, so that there is not a conversation below your normal post. \nI am going to try and figure out the whole scope, so I am going to ask a couple questions. I know you were able to get Ubuntu installed before, but currently what is the situation? I am not trying treat you like you are stupid, just want to follow your steps one by one. \n\n\n*\n\n*What brand of computer is this? Are you able to get to your BIOS/UEFI?\n\n*Did the installation process go through, or did it fail at the filesystem.squashfs error? (Like did you to the part where you partitioned your drives, set a mount point '/', or '/home' or something like that?) \n\n*Does the error occurred before the installation (the logo will come up before you can liveboot)? \n\n*If you get to the 'Try Ubuntu'/'Install Ubuntu' Screen are you going straight to Install, or to Try Ubuntu?\nHopefully we can get to the bottom of this. If you could add this information to your question that might help.\n\n", "Q: Problem with installing Ubuntu over Win8 I am trying to install Ubuntu on disk/partition where I had Win8.\nFirst image is partition with Win8.\nI deleted all partition except last two with data (sda5 and sda6) and created partition for Ubuntu.\nI installed Ubuntu and all went fine but when I try to boot it I get  bios saying select boot device. When I choose only disk I have in machine Ubuntu boots.\nI really don't know why Ubuntu didn't use sda2 to create boot partition. I know there are two options for boot (MBR or bios_grub). If I got that right. I found few instructions how to create partitions for Ubuntu but all are different. Like everybody has their own way.\nI know very little about Linux and any help and advice is appreciated.\nImage 1\nhttp://i61.tinypic.com/snnlms.jpg\nImage 2\nhttp://i59.tinypic.com/w6v394.jpg\n\nA: In your Gparted there image is a column on the far right labeled \"Flags\". In the row with the \"/\" as the mount point, there should also be \"boot\" in the Flags column.   \nYou can easily fix this in Gparted by:\n1) highlighting the partition you want to boot from\n2) select  Partition, then drop down and select \"Manage flags\"\n3) put a check mark next to \"boot\", and deselect boot_bios, then \"ok\"\nOnce you've done this, reboot and the system should now boot to the partition you've selected.\n", "Q: Will the (non-Mac) Xubuntu installation DVDs boot on Intel Macs? In the context of the Ubuntu (not Xubuntu) installation DVDs, it's been stated repeatedly that the developers couldn't create one DVD that would boot on both Intel Mac and non-Mac systems.\nOn the other hand, it's been claimed that the installation DVDs for Xubuntu will work with both Intel Mac and other systems.\nIs one of these claims incorrect?\nWill the Xubuntu installation DVD boot on Intel Macs without any problems?\n\nA: The amd64+mac images are BIOS only. The regular amd64 images are BIOS+EFI. The BIOS+EFI images are designed to run on both BIOS and EFI systems. Unfortunately some systems can not handle the combined \"hybrid\" boot image. Some Macs fall into this category (so do some PCs). The name \"amd64+mac\" is inaccurate, but was used because the problem was first discovered on Macs; it should more correctly be called \"amd64-bios-only\".\nSo in answer to your question, yes the regular Xubuntu image will boot on (most) Intel Macs. There are some PC and Mac systems which have BIOS/EFI bugs and can not boot the regular Ubuntu (or Xubuntu, or Debian) amd64 image. Thomas Schmitt, the author of the Xorriso tool that is used to build the install images, has written a small C program which will convert a hybrid BIOS+EFI (\"amd64\") image into a non-hybrid (\"amd64-bios-only\") image, so that it will boot on  systems that have the bug. If you have such a system, then this is a possible solution.\n", "Q: I have just one big partition with windows loader in it... how to install Ubuntu alongside windows in that case? I want to install Ubuntu on an old Windows Vista laptop.\nI need to maintain the Vista (yes, I know, it sucks), so I decided to create a partition alongside while installing it.\nBut I don't know what to do after I select \"something else\".\nThe next screen shows the partition list:\n/dev/sda\n/dev/sda1 ntfs size:1572 MB used:145 MB\n/dev/sda2 ntfs size:198475 MB used: unknown Windows Vista (loader)\n\nAnd that's all I've got there.\nIf I select /dev/sda and then click \"New Partition Table...\" I get this message that says \"You have selected an entire device to partition. If you proceed with creating a new partition table on the device, then all current partitions will be removed\".\nI don't want to remove all partitions... but I just have the windows loader as the big partition that has almost the whole disk.\nWhat should I do?\nI've installed ubuntu before and other windows machine, but in the first case I did have some free allocated space... I don't know how to manage this, when I've read that you should not touch the windows loader partition... \n\nA: You will need to shrink the volume of sda2 to allow space to \"install along side Windows\". Then you will have the option to install as you wanted, or you can \"do something else\" and create your own swap, and \"/\" root partition and install that way.\n\nA: You need to select the Partition, not the drive. /dev/sda is the drive, where /dev/sda1 is the first partition, and /dev/sda2 is your Windows partition.....so select /dev/sda1\n", "Q: leftover EFI files in hidden partition So I have tried to install Linux (unsuccessfully) multiple times and when I run diskutil list, I get this:\n\ndisk1 is my usb and disk0 is my hard drive (which is flash storage if that makes a difference) and I am running OSX 10.9.2. \nWhen I go to Disk Utilities it doesn't show the EFI partition and I have tried completely erasing my USB but this EFI partition is still there. \nWill this interfere with if I try to install Linux again and how do I delete it? \n\nA: OS X's Disk Utility hides the EFI System Partition (ESP) from the user. If you want to modify it, you must use other tools, such as diskutil or gdisk. You can explicitly mount the partition from the command line in OS X. The commands are:\nmkdir /Volumes/ESP\nsudo mount_msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP\n\nYou can then modify the contents of the ESP. Ubuntu's files will be in a directory called EFI/ubuntu.\nThis shouldn't be necessary, though, particularly not if you intend to re-install Ubuntu again. The new installation will simply overwrite the files from the old one.\n", "Q: How to install X11 Xevie extension to compile Xevie-based programs Is there a command to install Xevie (for X11 programming) from repository?\n(so that Xevie.h will be available for programming)\nI need it to compile this sample in Qt Creator:\n/* xeviedemo.c */\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xproto.h>\n#include <X11/X.h>\n#include <X11/extensions/Xevie.h>\n#include <X11/Xutil.h>\n\n\nstatic void\nprint_key_event (XEvent *ev)\n{\n    XKeyEvent *key_ev;\n    char buffer[20];\n    int bufsize = 19;\n    KeySym key;\n    XComposeStatus compose;\n    int char_count;\n\n    key_ev = (XKeyEvent *)ev;\n\n    printf (\"        State: %x KeyCode: %x\\n\", key_ev->state & ShiftMask, key_ev->keycode);\n    char_count = XLookupString(key_ev, buffer, bufsize, &key, &compose);\n    buffer[char_count] = '\\0';\n    printf (\"        Char Count: %d KeySym: %x char: |%c|\\n\", char_count, key, buffer[0]);\n}\n\nint\nmain(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    Display *dpy;\n    int major, minor;\n    XEvent  event;\n    XClientMessageEvent *xcme;\n    int count = 0;\n    long delay = 0;\n    int ret;\n\n    if (argc > 2)\n    {\n        printf (\"Usage: xeviedemo delay (in milliseconds)\\n\");\n        exit(1);\n    }\n    else if (argc == 2)\n    {\n        delay = strtol(argv[1], 0, 0);\n    }\n    printf(\"Delay is %d milliseconds\\n\", delay);\n    delay *= 1000;\n\n    dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);\n    XevieQueryVersion(dpy, &major, &minor);\n    printf(\"major = %d, minor = %d\\n\", major, minor);\n    if(XevieStart(dpy))\n        printf(\"XevieStart(dpy) finished \\n\");\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"XevieStart(dpy) failed, only one client is allowed to do event interception\\n\");\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    XevieSelectInput(dpy, KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n                     ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n\n    while(1)\n    {\n        XNextEvent(dpy, &event);\n        xcme = (XClientMessageEvent *)&event;\n        /* for readOnly users, send events back to Xserver immediately */\n        printf(\"(%4d)\", count++);\n        switch(event.type)\n        {\n        case KeyPress:\n            usleep(delay);\n            printf(\" KeyPress\\n\");\n            print_key_event (&event);\n            break;\n        case KeyRelease:\n            printf(\" KeyRelease\\n\");\n            break;\n        case ButtonPress:\n            usleep(delay);\n            printf(\" ButtonPress\\n\");\n            break;\n        case ButtonRelease:\n            printf(\" ButtonRelease\\n\");\n            break;\n        case MotionNotify:\n            printf(\" MotionNotify\\n\");\n            break;\n        case ClientMessage:\n            printf(\"ClientMessage: <%s>\\n\", &xcme->data.b[1]);\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf(\" unknown event %x\\n\", event.type);\n            break;\n        }\n        XevieSendEvent(dpy, &event, XEVIE_UNMODIFIED);\n        if(count > 10000)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    XevieEnd(dpy);\n    printf(\"XevieEnd(dpy) finished \\n\");\n    exit(0);\n}\n\n\nA: I don't think that any package provides Xevie.h.

Here's a simple checklist.\n\n\n*\n\n*DNS resolution of the email hostname should give the correct ip address of the server.\n\n*The server should be listening on the right ports. Use telnet from a different machine to check firewall issues. 143 for non-ssl and 993 for ssl should be open.\n\n*Check in postfix log file, which in most cases can be found at /var/log/mail.log\nSend a fresh email and check the last parts of log file to see what does the server do to your email.\n", "Q: Typed \"yes, do as I say!\", need to repair now Running Ubuntu 12.04.\nI was trying to install something, but I guess I didn't get the dependencies installed. I had a red circle in the top right near the clock, told me to run sudo apt-get or something. When I did, I had some option to remove some stuff and have new stuff installed.\nI typed \"yes, do as I say!\" to confirm, and noticed all my apps on the left side task bar were disappearing. I tried to stop it by holding the power button down. Now when I power up, I can log in, but there's just a desktop, no apps on the left, and no menu (?) bar with the clock and stuff on top. The files and folders on the desktop have no text under them either.\nIs there anyway I can repair this? Maybe just reinstall everything? \n\nA: Luckily for you, there are apt log files at /var/log/apt/ . The history.log file will contain the last packages which were removed. Look for the last part of the file and try to reinstall the files that were removed or purged.\nYou need to do a sudo apt-get install <package-names> for all the removed packages.

I'm a Linux newbie and I experimented with setting up my own Ubuntu server (server name : araliya, domain: autun.hom, IP: 192.168.1.99). I setup everything and installed bind9 to setup a DNS server using the tutorial posted here (How do I do a complete BIND9 DNS Server Configuration with a hostname?).\nEverything went actually very well, until the step at the very end, when I had to check whether the DNS server is working. When I gave the following command, I got a good output.\n> named-checkzone autun.hom /etc/bind/zones/db.autun.hom\n  zone autun.hom /IN: loaded serial   2\n  Ok\n\nHowever, when I did the same thing for my reverse DNS lookup I got a slightly different answer.\n> named-checkzone autun.hom /etc/bind/zones/db.192\n  zone autun.hom /IN: loaded serial   1\n  Ok \n\nThe tutorial said that the output of \"named-checkzone\" should be the same for forward and reverse lookup zones. But the \"loaded serial\" value I get is different between the two answers.\nWhen I followed all the other tests including, dig, hostname, nslookup, I get good output. In fact, my DNS server looks like it's working. When I checked the syslog, however, I get lots of errors:\nMay 10 20:09:04 araliya named[1026]: validating @0x7f1314706200: .

Can someone help me pinpoint where the error is?\n\nA: These error messages are related to dnssec. Remove or comment out all the lines in /etc/bind/named.conf.options that start with dnssec and restart bind9.\nThe best explanation for what's going on that I could find is here:\n\nWhen the validator receives a response from an unsigned zone that has\n  a signed parent, it must confirm with the parent that the zone was\n  intentionally left unsigned. It does this by verifying, via signed and\n  validated NSEC/NSEC3 records, that the parent zone contains no DS\n  records for the child.\nIf the validator can prove that the zone is insecure, then the\n  response is accepted. However, if it cannot, then it must assume an\n  insecure response to be a forgery; it rejects the response and logs an\n  error.\nThe logged error reads \"insecurity proof failed\" and \"got insecure\n  response; parent indicates it should be secure\". (Prior to BIND 9.7,\n  the logged error was \"not insecure\". This referred to the zone, not\n  the response.)\n\n\nA: Add below line to your \"/etc/default/bind9\"\nas below: \n# startup options for the server\nOPTIONS=\"-u bind -4\"\n\n", "Q: How do I get a sensors output in conky?

The current Ubuntu version is 14.04 and I wanted to upgrade to it. After starting up my laptop for the first time, I headed to the update manager. There were about 470 updates (security ones) and one for ubuntu 12.10. How can the update for 12.10 still be available when support to it has ended?\nI started the update , but unfortunately due to a really slow internet connection, I wasn't able to complete it. Meanwhile, I did have a trusty tahr DVD, which I suspect was not fully complete (the size was only 470 MB as compared to 900 MB which I read on a blog). So, I stopped the update and ran the DVD, which again unfortunately did not boot up. \nI checked if the DVD was correct and gong by the ubuntu forums, I should have booted up. The DVD was quite proper (the files and folders were as it should be and the ISO image was burned properly (using disk startup)).\nSo, after all of this, with all options exhausted , I tried to use the update manager. The 470 updates showed, but the system asked for a partial update. I did do that too, but it stopped halfway, asked me to insert the trusty tahr DVD.\nPlease help. I am pretty new to unpbuntu and don't really understand what to do now.\n\nA: Seeing that you have a new laptop the best option here would be to go for a fresh installation Download iso from here http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop \nIn case you have problems with DVD setup go for a Bootable USB. A clean installation is always better for a long run and for further updates.\n", "Q: How can I programmatically determine which files are currently open in evince? I have opened a PDF file with the document viewer from the GUI. Is there any way to get the path of this file in a terminal/script?\n\nA: Another approach would be something like\n$ for ip in $(pgrep -x evince); do lsof -F +p $ip  | grep -oP '^n\\K.*\\.pdf$'; done\n/home/terdon/file1.pdf\n/home/terdon/file2.pdf\n\nExplanation\nIn general, whenever you want to search fro a process, pgrep is better than ps -ef | grep process since the latter will also match the grep process itself. For example:\n$ ps -ef | grep emacs\nterdon    6647  6424 23 16:26 pts/14   00:00:02 emacs\nterdon    6813  6424  0 16:26 pts/14   00:00:00 grep --color emacs\n$ pgrep emacs\n6647\n\nThe -x option returns only processes whose entire name matches the string passed. This is needed because evince also starts a daemon (evinced) and that will also be matched without the -x (the -l is to print the name as well as the PID):\n$ pgrep -l evince\n4606 evince\n4611 evinced\n4613 evince\n$ pgrep -lx evince\n4606 evince\n4613 evince\n\nSo, the for loop will run lsof on each of the PIDs returned by pgrep. These are then passed through grep. The -o option means \"print only the matched portion of the line\"  and the -P activates Perl Compatible Regular Expressions which lets us use \\K. In PCREs, \\K means \"discard everything matched before the \\K  \". In other words, since I am using-o, it will match lines beginning withnand ending with.pdfbut it will not print the matchedn`. The result is that only the file's name is printed.\n\nA: You don't need to specify even the filename of the pdf  opened through Document Viewer. This below command will display the paths of all the pdf files opened through Document Viewer.evince is the actual command to open Document Viewer via terminal.\nps -ef | grep evince | sed -n '/.*\\.pdf/p' | sed 's/.*evince \\(.*\\)$/\\1/g'\n\nExample:\n$ ps -ef | grep evince | sed -n '/.*\\.pdf/p' | sed 's/.*evince \\(.*\\)$/\\1/g'\n/media/avinash/C68C57908C5779BF/pdf/PHP/PHP-Manual.pdf\n/media/avinash/C68C57908C5779BF/pdf/python.pdf\n\nBut all the credit goes to @Corp.\n\nA: TLDR:\nfor ip in $(pgrep -x evince); do lsof -F +p $ip|grep -i '^n.*\\.pdf$'|sed s/^n//g; done\n\nExplanation:\nDocument Viewer is the friendly name for the program /usr/bin/evince. So first we need to find the process ID (PID) of evince:\n$ pgrep -x evince\n22291\n\nTo list all files opened by this PID we will use the lsof command (note that we'll need to repeat this for every PID in case we have more than one instance of evince running)\n$ lsof -F +p 22291\nsome other files opened\n.\n.\n.\nn/home/c0rp/File.pdf\n\nNext we'll grep only for pdfs and discard the irrelevant n at start of line:\n$ lsof -Fn +p 22291 | grep -i '^n.*\\.pdf$' | sed s/^n//g\n/home/c0rp/File.pdf\n\nFinally to combine everything in one bash line:\nfor ip in $(pgrep -x evince); do lsof -F +p $ip|grep -i '^n.*\\.pdf$'|sed s/^n//g; done\n\nThis one-liner was inspired from the answer of terdon which is also very interesting in the way it solves the same problem.\n\nIf you are interested in what n in lsof -Fn is for, here is quote from man lsof about the -F option:\nOUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS\n       When the -F option is specified, lsof produces output that is  suitable\n       for  processing by another program - e.g, an awk or Perl script, or a C\n       program. \n...\n...\n       These  are  the  fields  that  lsof will produce.  The single character\n       listed first is the field identifier.\n...\n...\n            n    file name, comment, Internet address\n...\n...\n\nso -Fn, is saying show me file name, comment, Internet address\n", "Q: Enabling dual boot of windows after rewriting MBR with GRUB Some time ago I had two operating systems on my hard disk, Windows Vista and Windows 8 and I could double boot them.

Which version should I choose for recreational java development with git?

Most of the software in the repository is a few versions older than the latest released version of the actual various developers.\nYou might consider going to the developer's site of your favorite applications and getting the very latest reversions from them.  Keep in mind that the version on the developer's site might not be fully supported yet with your Ubuntu current Ubuntu version.\nWhile the latter might be true, this isn't something I have experienced by getting the latest from the developer.\nI alway install the latest version of Eclipse (being one of my favorite applications) from the developers site:\nhttps://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n\nYou probably already know by your reference to the latest version.\nThe version for linux includes the binary which will work directly from the archive extract.  You can extract the tar to /opt/eclipse and run the exec from there.\n", "Q: How to get CPU usage in percentages At the moment I am using a python script to log the output from cat /proc/loadavg to a file.

A few weeks ago I posted a question here about some ssh issues I was having with an Ubuntu 12.04 box. Fast forward to today and I am trying to allow someone else access to the machine, but they keep getting password errors. I checkout out var/logs/auth.log for more info, and found this:\nMay 11 19:45:33 myserver sshd[9264]: Did not receive identification string from 211.110.xxx.x\nMay 11 19:45:38 myserver sshd[9267]: Did not receive identification string from 211.110.xxx.x\nMay 11 19:45:44 myserver sshd[9270]: Did not receive identification string from 211.110.xxx.x\nMay 11 19:45:49 myserver sshd[9274]: Did not receive identification string from 211.110.xxx.x\n\nI have almost 10000 lines that all seem to say more or less the same thing (there are also 4 auth.log.gz files, which I'm assuming are more of the same?). Sometimes there is a random username attached to the request, input_userauth_request: invalid user bash [preauth]\nI don't know much about servers, but it looks like someone is trying to gain access to mine.\nGoogled around for how to block an IP address in Ubuntu and ended up with this: iptables -A INPUT -s 211.110.xxx.x -j DROP, but after running that command and checking the logs, I'm still getting requests from this one IP every 5 seconds. \nHow can I find out more about what's going on and deal with these constant requests?\n\nA: You don't want to see this failed login attempts in your logs so you should filter this IP in the network. \nIf you have own router or hardware firewall (not the one on the server) use it to block this IP. You can also ask your internet provider to block it.\nIf the server is VPS then ask your VPS provider to block this IP. In most cases they will not reject your request for help, cause it costs them nothing.\nAttacks from single IP can be easily mitigated compared to attack coming from many different IPs. To protect against distributed attack you need special service from network provider which you have to pay. On server level you can fight with Denyhosts or Fail2ban. Fail2ban protects not only ssh but other services. It uses a little more memory. Fail2ban use iptables to block IPs and DenyHosts use the file hosts.deny, both use logs to find malicious attempts. You can also configure iptables for rate limiting ssh attempts which does not rely on logs.\n\nA: From what you describe, it looks like an automated attack on your server. Most attacks are, unless the attacker knows you personally and is holding a grudge...\nAnyway, you might want to look into denyhosts, which you can get from the usual repos. It can analyse repeated attempts and will block their IP address. You may still get something in your logs, but it will at least help mitigate any security concerns.\nAs for getting more information, I really wouldn't bother. Unless they're an amateur, they'll be using a remote server to do their dirty work which will tell you nothing about who they really are. Your best bet is to find the admin for the IP range (WHOIS is your friend here), and let them know that you're getting a lot of access attempts from that IP. They may be good enough to do something about it.\n\nA: All good answers above, however...\nYou wrote \" I am trying to allow someone else access to the machine, but they keep getting password errors\"\nAs most of us are on a dynamic IP with a limited provider DNS lease time, most of us use a dynamic DNS service to access our server when on the road. Could it be that your remote user is also using such a service to get to you and that that's the IOP address you are seeing?\nBTW - a lot of \"port tapping\" hackers rely on you doing what many home server users do, namely, they don't change the default delivery state login id. (often \"admin\" !!) and just fire through all possible combinations of the password\n\nA: I think you will find that 99% of hacking attempts come from China. This is what I've found. It's useless reporting a Chinese IP for hacking as it's probably state sanctioned. \nI don't block just the IP, I block the range the IP is in. Use the \"subnet\" option on your router or with IPTables on your Linux box, use the subnet or \"/bits\" (eg : /24).\nThis page will give you a list of IP blocks by country (there's a tar.gz file with all) : http://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries . WHOIS web page https://whois-search.com/ gives you a good start as which country to look in. \n\nA: 1st. Unless you need to never open standard ports to your server to the net. Set the router up to open a random port like 53846 and forward it to that machines port 22.\nOpportunity hackers can scan a wide range of IP address for known ports like 22 and tryto exploit.\n2nd hit him back. Nmap him and find out what he is running. Then try to gain access to his. Just as return fire. If he knows you are on to him hem may stop.\nYou could also ping him like crazy like a warning shot. \n3 rd. Ifn you want to have some fun, you canopen the guest account. Make sure there are no privliges at all. Confine it to guests home directory. If you wwant to get cute you can set up a fake root directory structure for a run around. Set the password as a common one or no password.let him log in.\nThen you can use the write command and ask him why he insists on hammering your sever.\n", "Q: After adding \"greeter-show-manual-login=true\" I can't log in After I entered this command in terminal:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"greeter-show-manual-login=true\" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf'\n\nand I reboot my PC I cannot login.

I need the specification just for that command or at least see the screen show that first. So how? As you can say that in general not just for grep -i.\n\nA: While the simplest approach is to search with / as suggested by @girardengo, you can also use grep instead of sed which I find simpler:\n$ man grep | grep -A 1 '^ *-i'\n   -i, --ignore-case\n          Ignore  case  distinctions  in  both  the  PATTERN and the input\n          files.  (-i is specified by POSIX.)\n\nThe -A N means \"Print N lines after the matching one. Just a trick to get the next few lines, similar to Avinash's sed approach. \n\nA: You can use the search function inside man, just pres \"s\", type the key you're looking for, (-i in your case) and press intro.\n\nA: Or, you can let this site do the searching for you:\nhttp://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=grep+-i\nYou have to switch from using the terminal to a browser for a bit, but there's ways around that too.\n\nA: Type the below command on terminal:\nman grep\n\nThen type slash character, /, and write your search, like -i, followed by Enter. This will position the cursor at the first occurrence of the search string. Pressing n moves the cursor to the next occurrence. Pressing Shift+n moves the cursor to the previous occurrence.\n\nA: The most efficient method I am aware of is to search the man page for -i (This site seems to fail to render my code. What I mean is <space><space><space>-i). That's 3 spaces (you may need more/less spaces) followed by the flag you're looking for. It almost always works in my experience, and you can change to some variant of it in cases where it doesn't work.\nIt works because the actual documentation of the flags are typically indented. It avoids finding other mentions of the flag in other sections, because there's usually only one space before them.\n\nA: Try this simple sed command,\n$ man grep | sed -n '/-i, --ignore-case/,+2p'\n    -i, --ignore-case\n              Ignore  case  distinctions  in  both  the  PATTERN and the input\n              files.  (-i is specified by POSIX.)\n\nExplanation:\nsed -n '/-i, --ignore-case/,+2p'\n\n        |<-Search pattern->|\n\nIt will print the line which contains the search pattern along with 2 lines which present just below to the search pattern line.\nOR\nYou can simply give only the flags  in the search patten like below.\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ man grep | sed -n '/ *i, -/,+3p'\n       -i, --ignore-case\n              Ignore  case  distinctions  in  both  the  PATTERN and the input\n              files.  (-i is specified by POSIX.)\n\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ man grep | sed -n '/ *V, -/,+3p'\n       -V, --version\n              Print  the version number of grep to the standard output stream.\n              This version number should be included in all bug  reports  (see\n              below).\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ man grep | sed -n '/ *F, -/,+3p'\n       -F, --fixed-strings\n              Interpret PATTERN as a  list  of  fixed  strings,  separated  by\n              newlines,  any  of  which is to be matched.  (-F is specified by\n              POSIX.)\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ man grep | sed -n '/ *G, -/,+3p'\n       -G, --basic-regexp\n              Interpret PATTERN  as  a  basic  regular  expression  (BRE,  see\n              below).  This is the default.\n\nYou can add this script to your .bashrc ($HOME/.bashrc) for quick access:\nmangrep(){\n    USAGE=\"mangrep <application> <switch>\"\n    if [[ \"$#\" -ne \"2\" ]]\n      then\n          echo \"Usage: $USAGE\"\n      else\n          man \"$1\" | sed -n \"/ *\"$2\", -/,+3p\"\n    fi\n}\n\n\nA: Through all answers may be fine, but I think you are focusing in only a piece of documentation, not all. For example, to find the -i switch of the grep documentation:\ninfo grep Invoking Command-line\\ Options Matching\\ Control\n\nI will find all the information about \"grep\", how to \"invoke\" the specific \"command-line options\" for \"matching control\". Sadly it doesn't go more deeper than that, but it has -i, -y, --ignore-case in the firsts 25 lines, something reasonable that you don't have to scroll all your way down.\nThis solution is the more flexible and also allows you to search all the infopages:\ninfo --apropos=--ignore-case\n\"(coreutils)join invocation\" -- --ignore-case <1>\n\"(coreutils)uniq invocation\" -- --ignore-case <2>\n\"(coreutils)sort invocation\" -- --ignore-case\n\"(gettext)msggrep Invocation\" -- --ignore-case, ‘msggrep’ option\n\"(grep)Matching Control\" -- --ignore-case\n\n(had to use --ignore-case instead of -i since it was too common, but you can just process the output to info in any case)\nIn this case, you have both the name of the info page and the exact section. Ah, almost forgot, you can also just tab your way through most section of the info pages.\n\nA: You can use Perl and its \"paragraph mode\" to extract only the relevant paragraph:\nman grep | perl -00 -ne 'print if / -i/'\n\n\nA: My favorite approach to find a given option in a man page is to use a regex like \\s{2,}-option. For the question in hand, you can do man grep and then type the regex:\n/\\s{3,}-i\n\nor\n/ {3,}-i\n ^------------- space here\n\nThis will match -i only when followed by three or more spaces.\n\nA: If you want to grep the man <program> results for a pattern beginning with a hyphen, use -- before the pattern you specify. -- is a flag that most programs interpret as \"nothing after this should be taken as a flag\". Example using man find :\nman find | grep -- -type\n\nIf you want more info, for example the entire section describing an\noption, try using sed:\n$ man find | sed -n '/-mindepth/,/^$/p'\n   -mindepth levels\n          Do  not apply any tests or actions at levels less than levels (a\n          non-negative integer).  -mindepth  1  means  process  all  files\n          except the command line arguments.\n\nSource\n\nA: As less is used by default as the pager for man, you can use the LESS environment variable to pass a pattern to search for when less opens the page. This is identical to doing e.g. man ls and then searching for the option --all or -a by typing / and then inputting the pattern e.g. --all or -a.\nAll these can be done by:\nLESS='+/--all' man ls\n\nOr\nLESS='+/-a' man ls\n\nInput what you want to search after /.\nPresumably this works best for the long options (e.g. --all) compared to the short ones (e.g. -a).\n\nA: If you search for multiple options, you may use egrep:\nman shutdown | egrep -- \"-(r|H|h)\"\n\nif you don't want to search them one by one with /-(r|H|h) in the interactive pager less, which is possible, but better shown with a larger man page like that of ls:\nman ls | egrep -- \"-(a|f|h)\"\n\nman ls\n# interactive\n/-(a|f|h)\n\nFiltering for leading whitespace has been shown already. Grep can be invoked to show N lines after the option with A:\nman ls | egrep -- \"-(a|f|h)\"\n\n\nman ls | egrep -A1 -- \"^ *-(a|f|h)\"\n       -a, --all\n              do not ignore entries starting with .\n--\n       -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color\n\n--\n       -h, --human-readable\n              with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.\n\nWith sed you may specify \"from Option X to the next\" but in a hurry, I didn't find out, how to suppress the first line of the next, terminating option. If you need it often, you might write a shell function, to make it easy to use:\nman ls | sed -rn \"/^ *-(a|f|h)/,/^ *-/p\"\n   -a, --all\n          do not ignore entries starting with .\n\n   -A, --almost-all\n   -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color\n\n   -F, --classify\n   -h, --human-readable\n          with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.\n\n   --si   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024\n\n", "Q: Uninstall yesterday's synaptic packages with virtual terminal on Ubuntu 14.04 How to uninstall packages that were installed on 10 May 2014, using only a virtual terminal?\nAvailable are virtual terminals, using Ctrl+Alt+F1 or +F2.

I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit, and would like to make sure that TRIM is enabled (as much as I know - it is enabled by default). Is there some sort of command which would help me to find out if it is working correctly?\n\nA: You can perform a sudo fstrim -v / (replace \"/\" with other mountpoints, if you have any), to check if fstrim gives any errors.\nIf it doesn't, type in cat /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim which should give you an output like:\n#!/bin/sh\n# call fstrim-all to trim all mounted file systems which support it\nset -e\n#\n# This only runs on Intel and Samsung SSDs by default, as some SSDs with\n# faulty firmware may encounter data loss when running fstrim under high I/O\n# load (e. g.  https://launchpad.net/bugs/1259829). You can append the\n# --no-model-check option here to disable the vendor check and run fstrim on\n# all SSD drives Like this (remove the hash):\n#exec fstrim-all --no-model-check\nexec fstrim-all\n\nIf it does, it means, that your Ubuntu automatically recognized that you have an SSD and will trim it once a week as a cron job.\nIf you like to optimize your system for SSD, check out this article.  \n\nA: I would suggest that a more direct, if somewhat more complex, way to ensure that trim is working is by creating a file, identifying precisely where this file is stored, checking the contents of the file at this location, deleting the file, and then re-checking the contents of the file's location.  If trim is working, the original contents of the file will have been replaced by zeros.

You may want to retry after changing it to EFI mode.\n\n\nA: The biggest single problem people encounter when attempting to dual-boot Linux on an EFI-based computer (such as the vast majority of computers that shipped with Windows 8) is in enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support in the firmware. To paraphrase Nancy Reagan, just say \"no\" to BIOS/CSM/legacy support!!! Enabling that support can help get past a hurdle early on, but it creates several new hurdles later. In the end, you need to figure out how to get Linux booted without that support, so enabling it just creates work. (There are exceptions to this rule, but they're rare, and must be discovered on a case-by-case basis through experimentation.) Note that disabling Secure Boot is sometimes necessary, so if you've done that, don't re-enable it -- at least, not yet.\nThat said, you've clearly made this early mistake, so you now have to correct it. To do so, you should first go into your firmware and disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support. (The details of how to do this vary from one machine to another, but you've probably changed it to begin with, so you might remember what you changed.)\nWith BIOS/CSM/legacy support disabled, you must then install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. There are several ways to do this, but the two easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a boot medium from it, and boot it. rEFInd should give you options to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. Test both to be sure you can boot both OSes. If you can, boot to Ubuntu and install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. This will set it up as your default boot manager, enabling you to boot either OS from rEFInd without the USB drive or CD-R. Note that this approach requires that Secure Boot be disabled, at least initially. (You can re-enable it later, but that may require jumping through some extra hoops.)\n\n*Re-run the Boot Repair utility from whatever Linux installation you can get booted (probably a live CD or USB drive). With BIOS/CSM/legacy support disabled, Linux should run in EFI mode, which should enable Boot Repair to use efibootmgr, which is required for a proper repair of your installation. With any luck, when you reboot GRUB will come up and give you the option to boot either Ubuntu or Windows. Unfortunately, you take more on faith with this approach -- usually it works, but sometimes it doesn't help, and on rare occasion it will make matters worse.\n\n\nYou may want to read my page on EFI-mode Linux installations to learn how to do it right for future installations, or should you decide to just scrap what you've got now and start again.\n", "Q: How to open a folder in Ubuntu default file manager via terminal? I am using Ubuntu.\nFrom my terminal, how can I open my OS default file manager on a certain folder (e.g. on a folder that I view at current directory)?\nsay I change my current directory to:\ncd /root/dir/\nthen I list all the files there:\nls folder1  folder2  folder3\nNow I want to open folder1.\nIf I type ./ I get:\n./folder1 bash: ./folder1: Is a directory\nWhat is the command to make the file manager to open on folder1?\n\nA: I have found that simply typing gnome-open \"any-oject\" opens any folder or file in the default program on Ubuntu. \nIf this happens to be a folder, it uses your default folder-explorer :)\n\nA: If you want to open the folder via the nautilus file manager, you can move to the wanted directory like you've mentioned cd /root/dir/ , check the folders under that path using ls and then if you want to open folder1 type:\nnautilus folder1\n\n\nA: zsh shell can do that with the AUTO_CD option.  \nbob@tp ~ % setopt AUTO_CD\nbob@tp ~ %\nbob@tp ~ % ./Documents\nbob@tp ~/Documents % \nbob@tp ~/Documents % pwd\n/home/bob/Documents \n\nJust put setopt AUTO_CD in your .zshrc file (start zsh  one time first to create the zsh environment files).\nYou can invoke directly zsh at the terminal prompt to start a zsh session or you can change your default shell to be zsh with the chsh command.\nBtw this is not a strange feature, crossable directories do have the \"execute\" attribute so it makes sense to able to execute a directory like any standard commands.\n\nA: xdg-open /path/to/folder\n\nwill open the folder /path/to/folder in the default file manager.\n\nA: ./ is used to execute file (Not to open directory).\n(In)CLI Method: You can open folder in terminal by cd folder1 or dir folder1 or ls folder1.\n(To)GUI Method: If you want to open with file-manager (ex:nautilus) then typenautilus folder1 (for Ubuntu nautilus is default file-manager)\n\nA: You could specify the directory using ls, it will give you a list of that contents without moving from your directory\nls -al /path/to/directory\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 22 : To open the current directory use command below (or just nau and TAB then .)\n\nnautilus .\n\n\n", "Q: No animations shown when restoring a minimized window on ubuntu 14.04 I don't see the minimizing animation while minimizing the window, I see the animation only when I reopen the window after it has been minimized\n\nA: Unity Tweak Tool is useful for tweaking preferences.

After many trials and errors, the backup strategy I have selected resorts to using TAR (mostly because I was unable to find a tool to backup/restore dovecot mailboxes to an archive rather than mirror it to another server).\nThe plan is to shutdown services for the shortest possible duration when the backup is ongoing.\nI guess that the most sensitive services are apache2, php and mysql since they are required for webpage availability. Postfix, mailman and dovecot can be shutdown longer, since waiting a few minutes for them is not critical.\nMy questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an order in which I need to shutdown services?\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I find those which rely on each other?\n\n*For instance, I recon it is best to shutdown apache before php or\nmysql, that way the web server becomes unavailable altogether,\ninstead of potentially displaying odd stuffs to the visitors.\n\n*What about dovecot, mailman, postfix, bind? Do they rely on mysql? Do\nthey need other services?\n\n\n*What if I want to perform a snapshot?\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I shutdown ALL non critical running services and restart them later?\nThe idea is to minimize as much as possible write access on the disk during the backup.\nEdit: the server is hosted somewhere in the world. I can only access it through ssh.\n\nA: Don't rely on the dependence system, because it may change in future updates.\nThe correct procedure to follow is to change runlevel and go in Single User Mode with an init sequence (official MAN link). The system will terminate the services in the correct order for you.\nOpen a virtual terminal (CTRL+ALT+Fn) and gain root privileges with su or sudo su (last preferred). After you are root (\"#\"), execute:\ntelinit 1\n\nOR\ntelinit S\n\nYou can also use init directly if telinit fails.\nThis procedure will terminate any \"extra\" service to prevent excessive disk access and leave you as the only active user, what you need.\nAn alternative, longer, procedure is to reboot your system and access the Single User Mode from GRUB with the apposite menu option called Recovery (the Recovery Single User Mode will mount the filesystems with the read only flags enabled, do you'll need to remount them later).\nAfter you've done the maintenance or the backup, execute telinit 3 to go back to multi user mode; all registered multi user daemons will be restarted.\n\nPlease comment down here if you have more questions and don't forget to press the left UP arrow if I'm of any help.\nHave a nice day.\n", "Q: How to make Yahoo Messenger work? Just curious if anyone has had any luck or made any progress getting Yahoo Messenger to work with Ubuntu?  I know empathy and Viber and a lot of other work, but there are parts of Yahoo that make it a better fit for some of the people I am trying to convince to switch to Ubuntu.\n\nA: The best you can get currently seems to be gyache. Even though it is old and not maintained anymore. From the website:\n\nThis Yahoo! client for Linux operating system supports almost all of the features you would expect to find on the official Windows Yahoo! client: Voice chat, webcams, faders, 'nicknames', audibles, avatars, display images, and more. Yet, it remains very light-weight and memory-friendly. GyachE Improved uses Gtk-2 for its user interfaces (Gtk-2 2.0.6 or better required).\n\nYou need to install from source though. From install.txt:\nSteps for building a gyachi executable\n\n\n*\n\n*use the autogen script to generate a configure script:\n./autogen.sh\n\n\n*run configure, with any options that you might prefer:\n./configure --disable-rpath --enable-maintainer-mode --prefix /usr\n\n\n*To generate a spec file\nmake gyachi.spec\n\n\n*To build an image that will be installed over existing executables\n(not recommended):\nmake\nmake install\n\n\nA: Pidgin\nYou can also use Pidgin for meeseging in Yahoo.\nCan installed with :\nsudo apt-get install pidgin\n\n", "Q: how to publish a printer in 14.04 In ubuntu 14.04 My Printer is showing as shared but not published.

How to create 2 users a and b from shell, that will be able to read files of each other( say a can read the files of b, and b can read the files of a) .\nsudo adduser newuser\nsudo passwd newuser\n\n\nA: The classic way to do this is to make sure that both users belong to the same group. Then, you change the ownership of their files to that group. So, for example, to create bob and alice and allow them to read each other's files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the group that both users will belong to\nsudo addgroup users\n\n\n*Create the users, setting users as their primary group\nsudo adduser --ingroup users alice\nsudo adduser --ingroup users bob\n\nThat's it. Now, any files created by alice or bob will belong to the users group and since both users belong to that group, they will both be able to read them:\nalice@foo $ echo \"hello\" > ~/file\nalice@foo $ ls -l file\nalice@oregano ~ $ ls -l file \n-rw-r--r-- 1 alice users 6 May 11 16:12 file\n\nand\nbob@foo $ cat ~alice/file\nhello\n\n\nA: In a terminal (xterm is OK) execute cat /etc/group to obtain a list of available groups in your system; to add a custom group execute sudo addgroup group_name with a name of your choice.\nCreate the two users with the command you've written, then go to the directory with your files and execute sudo chgrp file or chown :group file to change their group to the one you've chosen before. After assign both users to the same group of the files with sudo usermod -a -G group username; this will not alter the existing assigned groups, don't worry.\nPlease feel free to comment under here if you have more questions and don't forget to press the left UP arrow if I'm of any help.\nWelcome to the community. :)\n", "Q: Update nvidia drivers with xorg-edgers ppa I wanted to update my nvidia drivers to version 337.19 with this package.

It came with Windows XP installed. I wish to use Ubuntu in it.\nDo I need to partition the HDD, or any other preparation, or is it all dealt with automatically with the download?\n\nA: It is better to install Ubuntu into separate partition for that create two logical partition in windows, one for ubuntu os and other is swap partition(size should be at-least your ram memory size eg: if you have 1GB ram create swap with 1GB or 2GB) and you can install into your created partition for ubuntu by selecting \"something else\" during installation(very important)\nHere is how to install step by step it works for any version of ubuntu http://www.techspot.com/community/topics/step-by-step-beginners-guide-to-installing-ubuntu-11-10.172128/\n\nA: Yes if you need to install Ubuntu seperately\nBut if you're new to Ubuntu as well as Linux, you should be careful since a mistake can blow your data away. Except for the case you don't need Windows anymore, you should use wubi. It'll install Ubuntu in a disk image alongside with windows with a windows dualboot menu instead of Linux Grub boot menu\n\nA: If you want ubuntu in dual boot you should create a partition but if you want to replace windows XP you dont need to create a partition.\nIf you want to install inside windows you dont need to do anything.\n\nA: It's best to download Ubuntu from it's official download page and burn it to a clean DVD disk or use software like DriveDroid.\nAfter that, turn off your computer and insert Ubuntu disc you've burnt.

Since my computer dates back to 2003, has an Intel Pentium M processor and is therefore not yet equipped with pae, I want to know if it is possible to install newer versions of Ubuntu as the version 12.04 LTS now? Lubuntu and Xubuntu have not worked for me and I do not want to, because their support will end soon. \nI have successfully installed version 12.04 (the non-pae version), but should like to the current version Ubuntu 14, is that possible? Would an update to bring something? Because newer Ubuntu versions still run my knowledge, only with pae? \n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 (and derivatives like Xubuntu) supports an option called forcepae which enables it to run on many older Pentium M laptops. Keep in mind is that these laptops are a decade or so old, and often lack the memory and GPU required to smoothly run a desktop like Unity that is designed for modern 3D accelerated systems. It might be better to try one of the lightweight distributions like Xubuntu.\nTo enable forcepae:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the 32-bit Ubuntu (or Xubuntu etc.) installer\n\n*When the image of the keyboard and little man in circle appears hit the Tab key\n\n*\"Choose your language\" popup appears. Use the cursor keys and hit the Enter key to choose your language\n\n*Press F6, a grey menu will popup with some boot options\n\n*Press escape to close the window\n\n*You will now see a line that says:\nBoot Options file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nEdit this line and add the forcepae parameter to the end:\nBoot Options file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash -- forcepae\n\n*Hit the Enter key, hopefully Ubuntu will boot and the rest of your install will be successful.

I closed my League of Legends game over an hour ago that was being played on PlayOnLinux.  I then started to play Warthunder on STEAM, but that game froze in the queue finder, and League of Legends was there in the background, even though the game has been closed for over an hour.\nI don't have any idea why it's doing that, and it could be many things maybe causing it.\n\nA: Launch as many of these programs as you can from a terminal.  You may at least see some error messages that way.  Don't think Blizzard has made a native Linux version, so you must be using WINE.  Can launch a Windows program from the terminal by changing to the directory where the program is installed and typing in something like \"wine WoW.exe\"\nMay be networking problems.  Are the correct ports open?  Does your computer have a different local IP address from before the upgrade, but your router is still forwarding the ports to the old address?\n\nA: These games are online so you definetely won't lose any progress reinstalling them :) . Try to install another copy of lol or wow in PlayOnLinux. Such problems always caused by changing video driver. My GTA San Andreas was broken because from 13.10 to 14.04 Nvidia driver version has changed (from 318 to 331).

On Ubuntu this button does nothing. However, this isn't a problem, since you can switch Wi-Fi and Bluetooth  on/off via network applet.\nThe problem is a led light indicating wireless card status. On Windows the light changes from white to red, when I turn off both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. On Ubuntu it stays white, even when I turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (via applet).\nQuestion: Is the card really powered off, even if the light is white? (I would like the card to be switched off for better battery time.)\nP.S.: One time, when I was using mobile broadband connection and I switched Wi-Fi off (in applet), the light went red, and when I turned it on again, it became white... but I was unable to re-create this again. \nThanks for any help.\n\nA: You can check for battery consumption with powertop\nsudo apt-get install powertop\n\nIf the card was still active, it would be among the first entries consuming the most power.\npowertop has some more usefull hints, where you can save battery time\n\nA: UPDATE:\nThe problem actually solved itself: When I use laptop on battery power (AC disconnected), the led light is red, meaning the wireless card is really off. Probably because off power saving settings, and that was what I wanted in the first place. \n", "Q: No sound from laptop speakers in Ubuntu 14.04 after booting into Windows 8.1 I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7537.\nI had installed 14.04 on it, and had no problems with the sound initially. However, like my with ethernet card, it seemed expecting to not have driver/software issues in linux was unrealistic.\nI purchased an SSD for the laptop and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on that. Then, I used gparted to copy over the windows partition from the disk that came with the laptop.\nEverything still worked just fine, until I booted into Windows 8.1. The sound worked fine while I was in Windows, but after rebooting the laptop, and going back into Ubuntu, the sound stopped working through the internal laptop speakers.\nI noticed however, that I was still able to use my headphones to receive sound while in Ubuntu.\nFrom here on, I could boot into Windows 8.1 to receive sound through the internal speakers, but I could no longer get the sound to work again in Ubuntu 14.04 unless using headphones.\nI decided to experiment, so I completely wiped the disk, and did a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04. The sound was back! I then again proceeded to copy over my windows partition. Again, after booting into Windows 8.1, and then coming back to Ubuntu, my internal speakers would no longer produce sound.\nI have tried the most common solutions like:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio unity-control-center\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nor\npulseaudio -k\n\nI have also tried making sure that nothing was muted in alsamixer. I have also tried installing the pulse audio volume control tool. If I have a song playing, I can see the audio levels moving for the internal speakers, as if it should be playing.\nThe pulse audio volume control tool also shows my HDMI card was a sound device, but it recognizes it as off.\nIt may be worth noting that in alsamixer, the application seems to recognize my PCH/output card as the secondary card, and the HDMI as the first. However, this has always been the case, so I am not sure that is the problem.\nI don't know a lot about how this is all engineered, but in my understanding I am having a hard time gathering how booting into another OS could stop the speakers from working in another.\nWhat can I do to restore sound to my system, and determine why booting into windows causes this behaviour?

This process is described in the article \"How Windows 8 Hybrid Shutdown / Fast Boot feature works\". Basically, on shutdown Windows kills all the user processes, and then hibernates the kernel to disk. It does this to speed up the shutdown and boot up process. Killing all of the user processes is faster than hibernating them to disk, and restoring a hibernated kernel is faster than a fresh boot of the kernel.\nLinux users are advised to turn off \"Hybrid Shutdown / Fast Boot\", otherwise they will be unable to mount NTFS filesystems (because the current state of the NTFS filesystem is not stored on the NTFS partition, but held in the hibernated kernel memory). From this question it also seems that it can interfere with device initialisation - probably by putting the device into a sleep state from which it does not awake when a normal boot process is carried out. \n\nA: I had a similar problem with my laptop (Samsung Series 7 Chronos) on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (dual booting with Windows). Since the introduction of Windows 8 (and following the upgrade to Windows 10) the speakers would constantly stay on mute (even though the volume settings would suggest otherwise).\nAfter some research online I discovered the Sound Troubleshooting Procedure. The step 1A of the procedure fixed the problem:\nkillall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*\n\n(i.e. it ends/kills all processes running pulseaudio, and it forces PulseAudio to reset its user configuration by deleting  files and folders that were created in the user home folder)\nwait at least 10 seconds then run the following command:\npulseaudio -k \n\n(i.e. it kills pulseaudio daemon)\nFor additional information concerning the aforementioned commands you might wanna check these links: Ubuntu Manuals - killall, Ubuntu Manuals - pulseaudio, Ubuntu Wiki - PulseAudio.\nIf these simple commands did not solve your problem, I suggest you to go through the alternative steps provided by the sound troubleshooting procedure.\nAs a final note, a trivial solution that worked for me: while in Ubuntu, plugging in and out the headphones would re-enable the audio from the speakers.\nWhat is the cause? It appears that the PulseaAudio configuration is corrupted/unsynchronised and does not reflect the current status of the sound system. Yet, I don't know the exact event causing the inconsistency.\n\nA: This is a pretty straight forward problem. I believe that Linux places your headphone jack in a state that Windows can not recognize. \nI have found that doing a cold shutdown (Holding power button for 10 sec.) of Linux and then booting into Windows will often fix this problem. \n\nA: I had the same problem and I followed Ubuntu's troubleshooting guide completely but it didn't work. \nIt finally worked by adding the below line to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf file :\noptions snd-hda-intel model=auto\n\n\nA: I recently started having the same issue. I dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04. The issue seems to have started after Windows update installed a new Realtek HD Audio driver.\nA soft reboot from Windows to Linux results in audio consisting entirely of pop and crackle sounds. Completely unusable. While in this state the headphone jack on the front of my case still worked fine. Only the rear audio was affected.\nIf I do a shutdown and then a cold boot into Linux then the audio works fine in Linux.\n", "Q: XRDP Gray Screen, Tried Everything After a couple days of searching for solutions, I still cannot get a proper RDP connection fron Windows 7 to Ubuntu Desktop 13.10 (or 14.04).

It looks different than the console but is fully functional.\n\nThis information came from\nhttp://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=5305\n\nNow, to go a little further, in order to be able to reconnect to the same session, do this:\ncd /etc/xrdp\nsudo vi xrdp.ini\n\nfind the line at the end of the [xrdp1] section that looks like this:\nport=-1\n\nand change it to say\nport=ask5910\n\nsave it.\n(If you don't do vi then you can use a text editor of your choice)\nNow, when you try to login from another machine you will get three prompts.  Username, password, and port.  Port will be prefilled with 5910.  If this is your first session you change the 5910 to -1 after entering username and password.  \nThen if you disconnect and want to reconnect, just leave it as 5910 and it will reconnect to the same session.\n\nA: Install xrdp and xfce4 and make xrdp use xfce4:\nsudo apt-get update    \nsudo apt-get install xrdp    \nsudo apt-get update    \nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nPoint xrdp to use xfce4:\necho xfce4-session > ~/.xsession\n\nDon't forget to Restart your xrdp service:\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\nCheck your configured hostname for xrdp:\nhostname -I\n\n\nA: I was going crazy with this, as like many others (I suspect) I am trying to get a Linux VM set up for the upcoming MOOC.

I'm just wondering if it would be beneficial.\n[Dual boot with Windows 8.1]\n\nA: NOT FROM WINDOWS!!!\nThe Windows disk partitioning tool has the unfortunate habit of converting from a standard Master Boot Record (MBR) format to Microsoft's proprietary Logical Disk Manager (LDM) configuration, which Ubuntu's installer doesn't support. Thus, if you try to create a partition for Ubuntu in Windows, you run the risk of creating extra work for yourself, since you'll need to use third-party tools to convert back from LDM to a standard MBR-only configuration.\nIn fact, I'd go so far as to say that the Windows partitioning tool is one of the buggiest partitioning tools in common use today. I've seen it do other strange things, like embed a primary partition inside an extended partition (a definite no-no).\nThat said, I've heard of fewer problems with the Windows partitioner on GPT disks, which are used by the vast majority of computers that ship with Windows 8 and 8.1. Still, I recommend using the Windows partitioner as little as possible.\nThe one thing for which the Windows partitioner is likely superior to the Ubuntu installer's partitioner is in shrinking the existing Windows partition. Just shrink that partition, though; don't create new partitions! Leave that task to the Ubuntu installer. You can let it do so automatically if you want to use the defaults, or use the \"Something Else\" installation option to set up a separate /home partition or otherwise deviate from the defaults.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu need at least a separate partition to work. If you want better stability, also make a Linux SWAP partition sized like the amount of your RAM, so Ubuntu will be able to use you disk like a RAM if necessary.\nIf you make a separate Home partition and a root partition for the system your personal data will be safer; this is a classic Linux partitioning process.\nThe default Ubuntu installation will install anything on one big partition: it's easy to manage but can be really \"fragile\" if something happens.\nAlways do a backup of your personal data before a partitioning process.\nDo not try to install Ubuntu with Wubi & Windows 8/8.1 because that will not work for compatibility issues.\nIf in doubt, please follow the Official Ubuntu installation guide or ask by commenting under here.

My questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*What Partition Types should I choose for the swap area and the root?  (Mind you, I am not asking about File System.) One excellent answer on manual partitioning  advises Primary for swap and Logical for root, but I want to recheck  because there seem to be divergent tips on this in the various discussions I have been able to check.\n\n*For \"Device for bootloader installation\" should I choose the entire HDD (which is given as the default choice) or the particular partition where Ubuntu is to be installed?   \n\nA: First, why Ubuntu 12.04? Version 14.04 is available now, and includes a number of improvements.\nSecond, the answer to your question depends greatly on your boot mode, which you haven't specified. You can identify your Windows boot mode by examining the partition table type -- if your boot disk uses the Master Boot Record (MBR), your computer is booting in BIOS mode; but if it uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT), it's booting in EFI mode. See here for more on identifying your boot mode. Once you've identified the boot mode, your question can be answered:\nBIOS-mode Booting\nMost PCs sold prior to Windows 8's release booted in BIOS mode, but some Windows 7 PCs sold after mid-2011 used EFI mode by default, and even a few older computers can be configured to use EFI.\nIf you're booting in BIOS mode, you'll be limited by MBR's restrictions, which begin with a 4-primary-partition limit. This limit can be gotten around by creating a special type of primary partition, known as an extended partition, which serves as a placeholder for an arbitrary number of logical partitions. Linux doesn't care much about the distinction between primary and logical partitions; you can use either type as you see fit, within the MBR's limits. Those limits become important because many PCs shipped originally with four primary partitions, making it impossible to create new partitions, even after resizing an existing partition. If you run into this problem, you must either delete a partition that's of little value (typically one holding manufacturer-specific tools) or convert one from primary to logical form. The latter task can be done with my FixParts program, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. Don't convert the Windows boot partition from primary to logical, though; that will render it unbootable!\nAnother meaning of \"partition type\" is a type code, which for MBR is a 1-byte (0-255, or 0x00-0xFF hexadecimal) value that identifies the intended use of a partition. The Ubuntu installer will set the type code appropriately if you create a partition using the Ubuntu installer. If you use some other tool, give the Linux swap space a type code of 0x82 and all Ubuntu system and data partitions a type code of 0x83. There are other type codes for uses like Linux LVM (0x8E), NTFS (0x07), etc.\nNote also that you should NEVER use the standard Windows partitioning tools to create partitions. These tools will convert the disk from MBR to Microsoft's proprietary Logical Device Manager (LDM) format if you create a layout with more than four partitions. You can't install Ubuntu directly to an LDM disk, so if you make this mistake, you'll have to convert back with the help of third-party tools.\nEFI-mode booting\nIf you're booting in EFI mode, you'll use GPT, which supports up to 128 partitions by default (and this value can be raised, if necessary). GPT doesn't distinguish between primary, extended, and logical partitions, although some partitioning tools still prompt for primary vs. logical status when you create partitions on GPT disk. (These tools then ignore what you say, since it's meaningless.)\nGPT also supports partition type codes, but instead of a single byte, GPT uses a 16-byte Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), which is awkward to display or enter. Thus, partitioning tools generally set the GUID automatically based on your stated use for the partition or use some sort of code. Tools based on libparted (including parted, GParted, and the Ubuntu installer) do the former, so you shouldn't have to explicitly set a type code. If you use GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, or cgdisk), you'd set a type code of 8200 for Linux swap, 8300 for a Linux filesystem, 8E00 for Linux LVM, 0700 for NTFS, and so on.\n\nA: For root and swap you can choose logical or primary your choice but remember you can only have 4 primary partitions on the hard disk after that no more partitions(logical or primary) will be created(i mean you cannot create partitions after that). If you want to create partitions you should convert one primary to extended(or logical) partition and split that into several partitions.\nso if you are out of primary partitions then its recommended to install both in logical, if not you can install them on primary partitions(if you don't have any use of primary partitions in future like installing windows again)\nI hope that helps\n", "Q: Trying to install Netbeans 7.4 When trying to install netbeans-7.4-linux.sh, I cannot open my personal folder where the file is located.

Resize it to get unallocated space.\n\n*You need to move the unallocated space just to right of the partition where Ubuntu is installed, so that it can be combined with your Ubuntu partition.\n\n*Right click on the partition you just shrinked, select Resize/Move and move the dragger to the extreme right, so that the unallocated space will be moved to left of the partition.\n\n*Try the above step to move the unallocated space just to the right of the Ubuntu partition (if you have many partition in between.)\n\n*Now right-click on the Ubuntu partition and select Resize/Move option.

I found that there is a bug regarding this and decided to revert to my previous state.\nFor this, I uninstalled all nvidia stuff (apt-get purge nvidia-*), reinstalled nvidia-331 and went into my BIOS to use the nVidia card only (no optimus or anything).\nNow it looks like nVidia is being used again, but I think this is not true. \"About this computer\" as well as \"Additional Drivers\" tell me that it is active and using the proprietary driver. \nBut if I, for example, start TMNF (Trackmania, a game) with Wine, it tells me it can't find the video card performance and when I start playing the game, it is very laggy and has graphics glitches – things that definitely weren't there before.\nAnother thing that makes me believe something is wrong: When booting, I get the grub screen asking what to boot and one screen asking me to unlock my hard drive. When using the Intel card, these screens had high resolution; using the nVidia card made them have poor resolution. In the current state, the first screen (grub) has poor resolution, but the unlock screen has high resolution as if it switched from nVidia to Intel during booting.\nLastly, when opening the nvidia-settings, I get very little information/options, which usually is the case when the Intel card is active.\nDoes anyone have any ideas what I could try or how to fix this? Reinstalling the system is something I'd really like to avoid.\nUpdate: I tried several methods described here and all tell me the nouveau driver is being used, not the proprietary one. If I boot the kernel with nomodeset, I am stuck with super low resolution.\nEdit: My setup: Lenovo T530 with Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: As mentioned in the comment, I ultimatively ended up getting my laptop into a state where I couldn't boot it, no matter whether I set it to the Intel or nVidia card in the BIOS.\nSo I used a LiveCD to back up some data and went for a reinstall. However, the nVidia driver still didn't want to work. There were a few problems, some of which I figured out what went wrong, but never why it went wrong (this was a fresh install!)\n\n\n*\n\n*the nvidia driver just wouldn't load, even if it was installed.\n\n*nividia-xconfig didn't exist (solution: it did, but for some reason the path wasn't set correctly, so it wasn't in the path).\n\n*the nouveau driver was loaded despite being blacklisted.\n\n*although the nvidia installation executed update-initramfs, I noticed changes in the boot behavior after doing it manually after the installation.\n\n\nAfter figuring out the path problem and what not I got it to work, but since there were a few iterations of experiments, I decided to once again start over new and reinstalled Ubuntu once more, expecting to having to apply the path fixes etc.\nBut – and here comes the weird part – this time nvidia installed just fine.

Comment!\n", "Q: Can I use Git to backup all my server changes? I want to use Git to monitor all the changes I make to my Ubuntu server. If I rollback changes, can I run into trouble when I rollback changes?\n\nA: A tangential answer to your question is around managing server configuration rather than the entire server's state itself.  \nHave a look at using Puppet; Puppet lets you define the state of your machine in terms of configuration, setup, applications, etc.  For example, you can specify things like\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder at /etc/xyz\n\n*Ensure that the file /opt/java has these permissions\n\n*Ensure that user 'jill' exists with this SSH key\n\n*Ensure that these PPAs are always enabled\n\n\nThe files in which you declare the above configuration are called \"Puppet manifests\" and what you can do is use git to put those manifests into a repository on a remote git server.  This means you can rerun the Puppet manifests on a fresh install of Ubuntu or undo changes by going back a commit in git.  \n", "Q: Auto mounting external hard disk using fstab gives all read write permission to it This is the deal:\nI had been using my Hard disk for quite a while and recently I used fstab to mount it automatically in /media/kevin/toshiba.\nNow, whenever it is mounted, its permission becomes drwxrwxrwx.

I recently upgraded my Toshiba Satellite C50D from 12.04 to 14.04.  Everything works great except the touchpad.  Strangely, it is working, but it is noticeably unresponsive and feels \"sticky\".  With some experimentation I think it requires greater pressure before it responds.  The thing is that if I boot back into 12.04 I do not have this problem, so it must be a software issue.  I have checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*All parameters given by xinput are identical, except the device name has changed from \"PS/2 Generic Mouse\" to \"ALPS PS/2 Device\"\n\n*The settings in Settings > Mouse/Touchpad are the same, except for the new two-finger scrolling things.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any idea as to how I can set up my touchpad to be the same as in 12.04?\n\nA: 1.Check whether the kernel has detected the Touchpad or not by executing at a terminal:\ncat /proc/bus/input/devices\nIf Touchpad is detected, then something like the following will appear: Name=\"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \nIf Touchpad is not detected then the following will appear: Name=\"ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse\"\nIn this case the bug must be a kernel issue.\n2.Check whether xserver has detected the Touchpad correctly by executing at a terminal:\nxinput --list\nYou should see the same name of Touchpad as above.\n3.Check whether the synaptics module is correctly loaded in xserver or not via executing at a terminal:\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i synaptics\n4.You may also want to try investigating with:\nevtest /dev/input/eventX\nxev\nLook for name in:\nxinput --list\nFor example:\n↳ TouchPad id=6 [slave  pointer  (2)] \nThen, type:\nxinput --list-props 6\nwhere 6 is the id returned in the first command. \nAdd any information returned to your question.\n", "Q: Can see my hosted files after upgrading apache I have lost web browser access to my local PHP files.

I've passed 3 days reading faqs about how to deal with this problem but I've only been able to download clamav 0.98.3 from here http://sourceforge.net/projects/clamav/files/clamav/0.98.3/\nAs well the clamav's user know we can't only type $ sudo freshclam and automatically update our clamav 0.98.1 to 0.98.3 .\nPlease ,explain me step by step how can I update my antivirus . Thanks in advance . \n\nA: The Linux malware is increasing (it's a good sign, because this means that Linux is becoming very popular!) and is a good practice to have a firewall enabled and a good antivirus to check the suspect files; this will also help to protect the other computers in your home/office.\nTo update the ClamAV's engine+database and fix vulnerabilities/bugs execute this safe and easy procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to the internet; you need a stable connection.\n\n*In a terminal (xterm is ok) execute sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade. This will ensure that your system is up to date; the clamAV installer can behave differently if your base installation is old or if your source definitions are old.\n\n*Install the latest ClamAV from the Official Ubuntu repository, like any other Ubuntu software. Do not install it from other, unsafe and non-specific sources, it can be dangerous.\n\n*Execute sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-clamav/ppa and then sudo apt-get upgrade. This should update the engine.\n\n*After all that, execute sudo freshclam to update the definitions. You must do that after an engine upgrade.\nIf you can't upgrade automatically your ClamAV installation, upgrade it from the source code or wait for an Ubuntu-specific release. I often suggest to compile the packages from sources because you often obtain a better result and you see what you are installing; please note that this type of installation is not always possible, you need the correct dependencies.\nTo install ClamAV from sources follow the Official ClamAV Source-Install Guide; if you don't understand one point of the guide, feel free to ask by commenting under here and don't forget to press the UP arrow if I'm of any help.\n\nA: *\n\n*You don't need an antivirus. \n\n*When you run sudo freshclam, that should download and install the new database. I am guessing (since you don't really explain) that what worries you is this message:\n$ sudo freshclam \nClamAV update process started at Sun May 11 22:18:14 2014\nWARNING: Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED!\nWARNING: Local version: 0.98.1 Recommended version: 0.98.3\nDON'T PANIC! Read http://www.clamav.net/support/faq\n\nFirst of all, that's just a warning. You can ignore it and the database will be updated correctly. If you insist on not ignoring it, you should do what it says and read http://www.clamav.net/support/faq which will take you to the upgrade instructions: https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-faq/blob/master/faq/Upgrading.md. Once there, you will note that the 1st suggestion is to simply wait until a package is available for your system.\nIf you wait a while, Ubuntu will tell you to update to the latest clamav. If youcan't wait and insist on installing it, you will need to install from source. I cannot stress enough that this is just not worth it. You really don't need an antivirus scanner on Linux and you certainly don't need the bleeding edge version of its engine. If you insist on having one installed, just update it normally with sudo freshclam and leave it at that.\nAnyway, to install from source, you will need to follow the instructions here.\n\n*You don't need an antivirus. Really, you just don't.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu and remove Windows 8 I am sick of the new Windows 8. I just want to get rid of it completely and run Ubuntu.\nI have a live CD.

So I upgraded to ubuntu 14.04 last night, and that went smoothly. But there is an issue with the postgres user and access to my postgresql database data directory. \nSo the database folder is on a separate harddrive. When I mount the drive, the system mounts it to the /media/krishnab/{drive} folder as per the current udisks2 standard. So now the postgres user has to go through my home directory in order to get to the database folder. \nI have included the postgres user in my krishnab group and also given the account a linux password. My home folder has \"Me\" (krishnab) as the owner and group krishnab. I have rebooted the pc a number of times too. However, whenever the postgres user tries to access the /media/krishnab folder there is always a permission denied error.

I know that Xubuntu is a derivative of Ubuntu but why is it showing up as Ubuntu (and not Xubuntu) in GRUB? \n\nA: This is normal behavior. os-prober sees the core of the system, not the desktop environment; and this is what it uses to create the boot menu. \nThe first listing, given as just Ubuntu, is whichever install is controlling grub on /dev/sda. \nI'm assuming you installed Ubuntu first, followed by Xubuntu. The menu listings will depend on how you installed the bootloader.\nIf you installed the bootloader to /dev/sda when installing Xubuntu, then the first Ubuntu listing at the top is Xubuntu and the 2nd Ubntu 14.04 LTS listing is Ubuntu.\nIf while installing Xubuntu, you installed the bootloader to its partion, say /dev/sda3, then ran update-grub in Ubuntu; then the first listing is Ubuntu and the 2nd listing is Xubuntu.\n", "Q: 14.04, b43 and DE regulatory domain I'm running 14.04 on a Compaq V6000 laptop which has a BCM4311 b/g wireless adapater, using the b43 firmware and proprietary blob (fwcutter).\nOn power-up, seemingly no matter what I do, the regulatory domain ends up being Germany.

His (and my) problem was that some adapters and access points interact badly in N mode. The workaround is to disable N mode and thus switch to a slower mode.\nFrom your log it doesn't look like you have an Intel adapter, but if you do, you can try zeroset's solution:\n\nTemporary solution\nFor a temporary solution, e.g. to check if the proposed solution helps\n  for your setup, reload the iwlwifi kernel module with option\n  11n_disable set to 1, in order to disable 802.11N, e.g. by\nsudo sh -c 'modprobe -r iwlwifi && modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1'\n\nYou\n  will be asked for your sudo password as you need root privilegues to\n  reload a kernel module.\nPermanent solution\nFor permanently disabling 802.11N in the driver, add the line\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nto /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\n\"Temporary\" here means that it will revert once you restart.\nsometimes you must first disable 802.11N like above, and then re-enable it again to fix the problem\n\nA: I was having a similar problem, but no device could connect, even with ethernet.  I'm putting my solution here, because this is the top google result for the error message.  \nI fixed this by turning the router off and turning it back on.  \nSo for any smartasses like me, who start going through their logs to diagnose the problem, and see Connection disconnected (reason -3), and have not yet tried restarting the router... go do that before googling on. \n", "Q: how do I enable gnome 3 on ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

Since the computer isn't mine the specs I don't currently have on hand, but I can tell you that it shouldn't be a big problem. \nThe problem(s) that I have been experiencing are quite difficult to troubleshoot for, since what I am experiencing is not to my knowledge an explicit error, but rather a usability problem that worsens with each boot. \nTake this particular time that I booted my computer. It took 10 minutes just to get past a blank screen with a cursor. Then I saw a second black screen, with a different font, for another 5 minutes. Then I saw the default 14.04 background. Then I waited another 10 minutes to see the login, then it crashed. So i went through the process again. You get the picture, right? Booting up takes half an hour or more.\nEvery other action that I want to perform or program that i want to load is similarly tedious. When I open terminal it takes about 60 seconds to see the username and computer name. My browser freezes about every 20 seconds... etc.\nWhen I installed this new version about 2 weeks ago, the problem was slight and hardly noticable. I did my graphic design work without the slightest wink of difficulty. It has since then started causing problems and continued to worsen and now my computer is hardly usable. \nIs there any way to discover what this might be? Since the problem presents itself upon first booting the computer, I doubt it has anything to do with mal-ware,spy-ware,viruses, etc. Perhaps I have the wrong install or maybe the problem is hard-ware related. How can I proceed? Should I just wipe and try a different version?\nThanks,\nAn Ubunt00n00b\n\nA: If I understand correctly the only OS on the machine is Ubuntu? It may be a driver issue, some bug or a hundred other things. Depending on how new your computer is(newer not always better) , try installing 12.04 on it, and see if the problem persists they are virtually identical in UI.

I recently setup my system to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows (keeping Windows only to game...an addiction I just can't break.) Anyway, I noticed the /opt and /usr directories were taking up a lot of space on my 32GB SSD, so I decided to move them to my HDD. Here's where the idiot in me took over, I guess.\nI made the fstab entry first, then rebooted the computer into a gparted installation. Well, it turns out I can't actually move the files between the hard drives from gparted (or I simply do not know how.)\nSo now I'm stuck in a reboot loop, and the root password is disabled disallowing me from dropping to a root prompt and alleviating the issue myself.\nWhat can I do?\nI'm stuck on Windows right now.\n\nA: It's not clear what you mean when you say drop into a root prompt.  Most likely you're saying drop into a console prompt (where you see a black screen).\nUnless you installed something special that you're trying to run after your OS installation you don't have to be concerned with the files in the /opt folder.  However, you will have to be concerned with the files in the /usr directory.  The lack of that directory will prevent normal functionality.\nIf all you did was move the /usr directory and it's othewise still in tact you can boon into the live disk (try ubuntu), mount that drive, and move the directory structure back to where it originally was.\nWhen you boot into the live cd try option you'll have full access (the \"root prompt\") included.\nYou can't do this from Windows.

When you click \"Shutdown\" or \"Restart\" with fast-startup enabled the computer doesn't actually shutdown it just goes into a minimal deep hibernation state to make it look like Windows boots quickly.

The indicator icon in the Gnome panel (I use Flashback) turns yellow, but it's easy to miss.\nIt can be set to play a sound, but I'm often using my laptop in public settings where having an alarm go off at regular intervals wouldn't be acceptable.\nThe program does offer me the option of running a command when the alarm goes off. It would be great if I could set something that maybe placed notice on my screen that I couldn't ignore, or overlayed a transparent red over everthing, or something like that. I'm open to ideas, the point just being that it should be something that there is no way I can ignore it.\nIs there any command I can run that would create some kind of completely blatant visual notification?\n\nA: You can use zenity to creates Graphical (GTK+) Dialog Boxes.\nTry to add this command:\nzenity --warning --text=\"Insert yout text here!\"\n\nor insert command inside a script.\nRefer to zenity --help or man zenity for more help.\n\nA: Install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nOpen CCSM and go to Effects -> Wizard, choose some key combination to turn it on/off.\n\nFor me it is Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W.\n\nDon't forget to enable Wizard.\nNow you can try it.

Just highlight the latest one, or the one marked as tested, and click \"Apply Changes\" then reboot.\n\nHowever, I don't think your card is supported.  I have a Radeon HD 4200 and it's not supported any more.  The problem is that most of the newer, supported versions of Ubuntu use an updated version of the Xorg display server, and AMD has stopped supporting its older cards in newer versions of the driver that are packaged with Ubuntu, and the older drivers don't work with the new Xorg server so you can't just go get those and use them.  The only way to get proprietary driver support without buying one of the newer, supported cards is to downgrade several versions of Ubuntu.\nI just confirmed, your card is not supported.  I just went and downloaded the deb file for the proprietary drivers and dug through the documentation, and this is what I found.\nQuote: \"The AMD Proprietary Linux driver currently supports RADEON 8500 and later, as well as FireGL 8700 and later products. We do not currently plan to include support for any products earlier than this.\"\n\nA: Search the dash for Additional drivers. You should find that there are a couple of options listed to install drivers.

I've looked around quite a bit but can't identify how to disable them?\nNotifyOSD Configuration let's me change the look of them, but not get rid of them. Can anyone help?\nThanks.\n\nA: To completely turn off notifications, open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type the following command:\nsudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service.disabled\n\nFinally restart your system to open a new session without notifications bubbles.\n\nA: Effectively disable notifications without messing with your system\nA shamelessly ugly, but guaranteed perfectly working solution below. Although it is ugly, I can't see a real downside, and when no other options seem to exist or work, I believe we are excused.\nThe solution\nFrom this nice answer, we learn that you can keep an eye on upcoming notifications. If we edit the command in that answer a bit, to simply kill the notification before it actually pops up, we effectively disable notifications. The set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a small script with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\" | grep --line-buffered \"string\" | grep --line-buffered -e method -e \":\" -e '\"\"' -e urgency -e notify -v | grep --line-buffered '.*(?=string)|(?<=string).*' -oPi | grep --line-buffered -v '^\\s*$' | xargs -I '{}' pkill notify-osd\n\n\n*Save it as nonotifications.sh, and make it executable\n\n*Test- run it by running in a terminal:\n/path/to/nonotifications.sh\n\n(keep it running)\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your Startup Applications. Choose Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && /path/to/nonotifications.sh\"\n\nAdditional options\nThe fun part is that the solution can be connected to a script, as mentioned here, to (for example) only allow certain notifications, or only disable specific ones.\n\nA: You can use Dconf Editor to disable the notifications.  To install dconf editor, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I do not want to know all packages installed, only those that were not part of the initial OS install, and have been explicitly installed afterwards.\nFor the sake of this question, lets assume a fresh install, as I imagine distro upgrades would complicate matters. I would prefer to use command line, but a GUI solution would be OK if a command or script is not available.\nI've had a quick look at the man pages of dpkg and aptitude, but didn't see anything obvious. Also, the output of apt-cache show package-name or dpkg -s pkg-name doesn't seem to give any dates that can be compared against the date of OS installation (which I would have to work out how to get too).\nI have logwatch on a server that sends daily notifications of what has been installed. My guess is that it parses dpkg.log. I'm not sure this method would be a solution, as many of the install entries may have been logrotated out, especially on older systems. And ideally this should work for any system, desktop or server.\nIt would also be great if the output could include the version of the package currently installed, but that may be asking too much, and I can always script it later once I have the package names.\n\nA: All Ubuntu ISO ([UKLX]buntu/Ubuntu-gnome) comes with .manifest file that contains the list of all pre-installed packages in the ISO.

Take the list of available Ubuntu releases as an example; if you have Trusty 64-bit for example, the manifest link would be \nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.manifest.\nSo once you have this file, just compare the package listing in it against the listing of all installed packages in your Ubuntu using comm command\n$ curl -O http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.manifest\n$ comm -23 <( dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 ~ /^(install|hold)/ { print $1 }' | sort ) \\\n        <( awk '{ print $1 }' ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.manifest | sort )\n\nTo explain what the comm does, it takes input from 2 files - first one supplies the list of all currently installed packages and the second one the manifest file. The -3 opt suppresses lines that both files have and -2 suppresses lines that only the second file (manifest file, that is) has. So in the end your output contains only lines that only file one has and that gives you packages that you installed manually since the OS was installed.\nSo there you have it.\nEdit\nIf you'd also like to see the package version next to package name in the output, as Slyvain Pineau pointed out, pipe the comm command above to xargs dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\\n' so it becomes\n$ comm -23 <( dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 ~ /^(install|hold)/ { print $1 }' | sort ) \\\n           <( awk '{ print $1 }' ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.manifest | sort ) | \\\n           xargs dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\\n\n\nOr alternatively, with awk entirely, This too give the same result as command above\nawk 'FNR==NR {arr[$1];next} !($1 in arr) { print $0 }' ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.manifest <( dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\\n' )\n\nSee this link for explanation on how the awk cmd work\n\nA: The initial-status.gz and dpkg-query method from https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/80520/9132 gives the most accurate and concise list for my needs.\ncomm -13 \\\n  <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort) \\\n  <(comm -23 \\\n    <(dpkg-query -W -f='${Package}\\n' | sed 1d | sort) \\\n    <(apt-mark showauto | sort) \\\n  )\n\nWhy I like it, and not the others:\nThe manifest comparison method from Flint's answer and from https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/3624/9132 includes many dependencies and other packages possibly marked as 'required' and installed automatically. For example, it lists libvlc5 and vlc-data, whereas the method above only lists vlc.\nThe history.log method from https://askubuntu.com/a/250530/16741 will not list all packages if the logs do not go back as far as the release install. It also contains a lot of upgrade commands that would need to be filtered out.\nThe dpkg --get-selections method, which is an accepted answer from a similar question, lists all packages and dependencies, including those installed with the release. It does not list only those installed explicitly.\n\nA: Big thanks and congratulations to those who came up with that gem of a script !!!\nI wanted to add my 2¢ and I tacked the installation date I deduce from $info.\nI did not master the details why $info files are updated or not and when, but it works in practice.\nMy script lists the latest updates of non dependency packages added after installation.\nGiving it a periodic check, I was seeing what I would have manually logged without a single miss.\nThat is, batches of packets installed for the same reason.

In previous versions of Ubuntu, when my laptop battery hit somewhere around 20% power, the icon in the Gnome panel (I use Flashback) would turn red. Also, there would be intermittent warnings telling me the computer was going to power off soon.\nHowever, since upgrading to 14.04, I no longer get warnings, and, as far as I can tell, the computer is powering off a little early, like around 30%. I'Ve been caught off guard multiple times now.\nIn the power settings dialog, there is an option for what to do when power is critically low, and I can change it to \"Hibernate\" or \"Power off\". But there seems to be nothing about warnings or what determines \"critically low\".\nHow do I get Ubuntu to give me fair warning before powering off? And can I get it to have a little more patience instead of panicking and shutting down when I've still got an hour left?\n\nA: You can set the levels for \"low\", \"critically low\" and \"action\" by entering the following commands at the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-low XX\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-critical YY\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-action ZZ\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy false\n\nwhere XX, YY and ZZ are the battery charge levels. Set use-time-for-policy to \"false\" to define the \"level\" in terms of battery charge level (instead of time to empty). \nTo see existing levels, use\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-low\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-critical\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-action\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy\n\n", "Q: How to get Gnome Shell to remember my display preferences?

Everything works great, I have multiple sites set up. My router allows only one device to own the public IP which is my Ubuntu Server. I set up a RaspberryPi with a Camera and Motion. Again, everything works great - I can access the Cam via a browser (IP:8081). \nI want to run a website from my Ubuntu and display a live stream from the raspberry. This works great with <img src=\"IP:8081?action=stream />. However, since the raspberry is internal IP only, I can't see the stream when I'm outside my network.\nWhat do I need to do to have my Ubuntu accessing the raspberry and feedback the stream?\nThe app is based on codeigniter by the way, motion is set up to work outside locahost as well.\n\nA: So you have a server that straddles two networks (WAN and LAN) and you want to expose something from the LAN on the WAN, as part of other content the server hosts.\nThe easiest way is to tell your HTTP server to proxy the connection. Most servers can do this but I'd do it with Nginx over anything else because it's the best (fastest, smallest, etc, etc). You would use a rule like this:\nlocation /webcam/ {\n    proxy_pass http://internal_webcam_IP:8081/?action=stream;\n}\n\nFor Apache, the same holds true... You just create a quick reverse proxy:\nProxyRequests off\nProxyPass /webcam http://internal_webcam_IP:8081/?action=stream\n\nAnd then change the HTML image location to:\n<img src=\"/webcam/\" />\n\nThe networking side of this should be fairly simple but the image hosting on the webcam might not work in an image tag (some use MJPEG, some use javascript) so you might need to embed a page via an iframe, or write some new javascript to update the image (cleaner than the iframe but more work). If you do this, you might need to open up the proxy so it isn't just mirroring the /?action=stream URL.\nThat complicates things. We're talking about embedded hardware here: famously under-updated and —on the whole— infamously easy to hack. If you do need to open the proxy up to a wider selection of URLs you'll probably also want to add a load of explicit URLs to be blocked to stop external people gaining too much access to your internal network.\n\nThe other direction is to use PHP and CodeIgniter to proxy whatever you need.... However a general webdev rule of thumb is that if you can avoid it, don't tie up your server side language handling menial tasks. This is something you can offload to the webserver (or even the networking stack — which I'm not going into because it offers no security at all).\n", "Q: Canon-LBP2900 printer not working on ubuntu 14.04 I could not get cannon lbp printer to work on ubuntu (14.04) after trying everything possible on the internet.\nPackages intsalled - cndrvcups-capt_2.60-1_i386.deb and cndrvcups-common_2.60-1_i386.deb\nThe Printer adds job the queue and fails to print silently.\nHere is the cups error log -\n\nipt@ipt-G41D3C:~$ tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log\nE [12/May/2014:11:33:22 +0000] [Client 19] Returning IPP client-error-document-format-not-supported for Print-Job (ipp://localhost/printers/Generic-text-only) from localhost\nE [12/May/2014:12:01:30 +0000] **Canon-LBP2900**: File \"/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstocapt\" not available: No such file or directory\nE [12/May/2014:12:01:30 +0000] Canon-LBP2900: File \"/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstocapt\" not available: No such file or directory\nE [12/May/2014:12:01:30 +0000] Canon-LBP2900: File \"/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstocapt\" not available: No such file or directory\nE [12/May/2014:13:59:53 +0000] [Job 13] Unable to send data to printer.\nE [12/May/2014:14:04:53 +0000] [Job 13] Stopping unresponsive job.\nE [12/May/2014:14:06:37 +0000] [Job 14] Unable to send data to printer.\n\nAs you can see in the snapshot printer is not able to process the print jobs.\n\nA: I finally got my LBP 2900 printer to work on ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit.

This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.\nMode 1\nactive-backup\n\nActive-backup policy: Only one slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The bond's MAC address is externally visible on only one port (network adapter) to avoid confusing the switch. This mode provides fault tolerance. The primary option affects the behavior of this mode.\nMode 2\nbalance-xor\n\nXOR policy: Transmit based on [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address) modulo slave count]. This selects the same slave for each destination MAC address. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.\nMode 3\nbroadcast\n\nBroadcast policy: transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance.\nMode 4\n802.3ad\n\nIEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification.\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving the speed and duplex of each slave.\n\n*A switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Most switches will require some type of configuration to enable 802.3ad mode. \n\n\nMode 5\nbalance-tlb\n\nAdaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load (computed relative to the speed) on each slave. Incoming traffic is received by the current slave. If the receiving slave fails, another slave takes over the MAC address of the failed receiving slave.\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving the speed of each slave. \n\n\nMode 6\nbalance-alb\n\nAdaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system on their way out and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique hardware address of one of the slaves in the bond such that different peers use different hardware addresses for the server. \n\nA: I think that the best source is this Kernel.org document, it also provides explanations about when is each type optimal, and so on.\nThe sections are long, I only paste short excerpts:\n\n11.2.1 HA Bonding Mode Selection for Multiple Switch Topology\nIn a topology such as the example above, the active-backup and\n  broadcast modes are the only useful bonding modes when optimizing for\n  availability; the other modes require all links to terminate on the\n  same peer for them to behave rationally.\nactive-backup: This is generally the preferred mode, particularly if\n    the switches have an ISL and play together well.  If the    network\n  configuration is such that one switch is specifically     a backup switch\n  (e.g., has lower capacity, higher cost, etc),     then the primary option\n  can be used to insure that the    preferred link is always used when it\n  is available.\nbroadcast: This mode is really a special purpose mode, and is suitable\n    only for very specific needs.  For example, if the two  switches are\n  not connected (no ISL), and the networks beyond   them are totally\n  independent.  In this case, if it is  necessary for some specific\n  one-way traffic to reach both     independent networks, then the\n  broadcast mode may be suitable.\n...\n12.1.1 MT Bonding Mode Selection for Single Switch Topology\nThis configuration is the easiest to set up and to understand,\n  although you will have to decide which bonding mode best suits your\n  needs.  The trade offs for each mode are detailed below:\nbalance-rr: This mode is the only mode that will permit a single\n    TCP/IP connection to stripe traffic across multiple     interfaces. It\n  is therefore the only mode that will allow a  single TCP/IP stream to\n  utilize more than one interface's     worth of throughput.  This comes at\n  a cost, however: the  striping generally results in peer systems\n  receiving packets out     of order, causing TCP/IP's congestion control\n  system to kick    in, often by retransmitting segments.\n...\nactive-backup: There is not much advantage in this network topology to\n    the active-backup mode, as the inactive backup devices are all\n    connected to the same peer as the primary.  In this case, a     load\n  balancing mode (with link monitoring) will provide the    same level of\n  network availability, but with increased  available bandwidth.  On the\n  plus side, active-backup mode     does not require any configuration of\n  the switch, so it may     have value if the hardware available does not\n  support any of    the load balance modes.\nbalance-xor: This mode will limit traffic such that packets destined\n    for specific peers will always be sent over the same    interface. \n  Since the destination is determined by the MAC    addresses involved,\n  this mode works best in a \"local\" network     configuration (as described\n  above), with destinations all on  the same local network.  This mode\n  is likely to be suboptimal    if all your traffic is passed through a\n  single router (i.e., a    \"gatewayed\" network configuration, as\n  described above).\nAs with balance-rr, the switch ports need to be configured for\n    \"etherchannel\" or \"trunking.\"\nbroadcast: Like active-backup, there is not much advantage to this\n    mode in this type of network topology.\n802.3ad: This mode can be a good choice for this type of network  topology.  The 802.3ad mode is an IEEE standard, so all peers   that\n  implement 802.3ad should interoperate well.  The 802.3ad  protocol\n  includes automatic configuration of the aggregates,   so minimal manual\n  configuration of the switch is needed     (typically only to designate\n  that some set of devices is   available for 802.3ad).  The 802.3ad\n  standard also mandates    that frames be delivered in order (within\n  certain limits), so   in general single connections will not see\n  misordering of    packets.  The 802.3ad mode does have some drawbacks:\n  the   standard mandates that all devices in the aggregate operate at\n    the same speed and duplex.  Also, as with all bonding load  balance\n  modes other than balance-rr, no single connection will    be able to\n  utilize more than a single interface's worth of   bandwidth.  \n...\nbalance-tlb: The balance-tlb mode balances outgoing traffic by peer.\n    Since the balancing is done according to MAC address, in a\n    \"gatewayed\" configuration (as described above), this mode will  send\n  all traffic across a single device.  However, in a    \"local\" network\n  configuration, this mode balances multiple    local network peers across\n  devices in a vaguely intelligent  manner (not a simple XOR as in\n  balance-xor or 802.3ad mode),     so that mathematically unlucky MAC\n  addresses (i.e., ones that    XOR to the same value) will not all \"bunch\n  up\" on a single   interface.\n...\nbalance-alb: This mode is everything that balance-tlb is, and more.\n    It has all of the features (and restrictions) of balance-tlb,   and\n  will also balance incoming traffic from local network     peers (as\n  described in the Bonding Module Options section,  above).\nThe only additional down side to this mode is that the network\n    device driver must support changing the hardware address while  the\n  device is open.\n\n", "Q: Accidentally moved the home Directory to another folder I was trying to move a folder \"Foxit Reader\" which was located in /opt  to the home Directory.

Here is how my partitions looked when I tried to install first:\n(sorry I was just warned that I cannot insert images, so I have to describe:\nThere were 3 partitions on Disk 0: \n(1) Active Recovery Partition  1.46 GB  100 % Free\n(2) Primary Partition         10.07 GB  100 % Free\n(3) Boot, Page File, Primary Partition 446.22 GB 37 % Free\nAnd 1 partition on Disk 1:\n(4) Hibernation Partition               11.21 Gb  100 % Free\nAfter a lot of hesitation I deleted the 11.21 Gb Hibernation partition, as it was 100% free. The action was successful, it became unallocated space, - but it remained a separate entity on Disk 1. I have tried to delete Disk 1 but neither the Disk Management utility, nor the diskpart program let me do it.\nI tried to install Ubuntu again, - still without success. \nI went to the \"Try Ubuntu\" option (from a bootable USB stick as my laptop has no CD/DVD drive), and used the Gparted program to shrink the 446.22 Gb Windows partition, and created another 60 Gb unallocated space beside it. \nBut when I try to install Ubuntu, the Installation Type dialog does not offer any options, and the window which should show the partitions to allocate space for the installation is empty. There are 3 buttons underneath: +/-/Change... but if I try to click any of those, the screen goes blank, and I have to restart the computer.\nThe \"Device for boot loader installation\" entry box shows: /dev/sda and there is nothing else to be selected.\nSo at this point I have to quit the installation because I don't want to overwrite my Windows installation.\nWhat am I doing wrong? Can I install Ubuntu alongside Windows, and if yes, how?\nPlease help.\nThank you\nPeter\n\nA: OK, it seems like you are trying to install Ubuntu when your computer is set up to boot from bios. To check, boot into your Windows 7 partition, press start,  click on my computer and select manage. Under disk management all of your partitions should come up. If you see a 100 mb system reserved partition chances are your system uses bios. \nSteps to take \nIf your Windows boots fine and works, I would back up the entire disk (it is called create a system image under Windows 7 back up options). You would need another hard drive or a set of DVDs. \nThis ensures that if you accidentally hose your Windows install you aren't left with a brick. \nYou would also need to create a repair disk (image back up will prompt you) and system recovery disks if you don't have those already. \nWhat you need to do is resize your main Windows partition (the 400+gb one) so that you have enough space to install Ubuntu. \nOnce you have done that, to reduce the number of the partitions to less than 4, the safest method is to remove the recovery partition.\nThis is usually provided by oems to reinstall your computer to factory defaults. However it is not needed if you have create a system image, a repair disk (to let Windows use your system image to restore) and recovery disks so that you can roll back your system to factory defaults. \nOnce you have wiped the oem recovery partition Ubuntu should install (choose use largest continuous free space \n", "Q: Ubuntu Server SD on HP Microserver G8 G1610T I've recently purchased a HP Microserver G8 G16010T with the Intel Celeron processor.  Have installed 2 x 2TB seagate NAS drives and 4Gb RAM.  I'm primarily looking to get a LAMP setup going.\nWould really appreciate responses to these questions as I'm feeling my way here:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP list as a certified OS: Ubuntu Server 12.04, and point to \nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso - just want to be sure though that this is the correct version for the G1610T (i.e. not just the G2020)?\n\n*I've read many of the HP forum entries on the fan noise on the HP MS G8 - and appear to be linked to either iLo or the B120i Smart Array controller - but understand that these features aren't supported by Ubunutu Server?

But as you pointed out, point 2 is the real problem. The certification just says 'it runs'. It doesn't tell you anything about how well it runs (see ubuntu certification 1255330 for this).\n\n*The terrible truth is, that ubuntu doesn't runs well on this machine. I will switch to another OS while the noise is really uncool. So take this advice: if the sound volume is a relevant factor for you: switch the os or the hardware. Otherwise see the link (but there is no quick and easy solution so far. I am really annoyed about my decision buying this machine and trusting in the certification. :( The bug tickets for the smart array driver (the whole family seems to be unsupported for now) could be relevant for you.\n\n*See steffs answer for point 3. :-)\n\n\nI hope this information could help you.\n\nA: *\n\n*YES, MicroServer G8 is certified to run Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*The fan noise is related to the thermal sensor for the HDDs. In order to do not face the problem you have to use the RAID controller embedded in the server, but it is not supported by HP. Upgrading iLO and BIOS both to the latest firmware, reduces the speed and the noise. Running Windows and using the embedded RAID is very quiet.\n\n*Yes I am running Ubuntu installed on a 16 GB uSD card since past October and it is just fine. Be sure to upgrade to the latest firmware both the iLO and the BIOS, it is MANDATORY.

Make sure you are running the latest kernel packages. You could also try to upgrade to the mainline kernel where the bug might be fixed already (see How do I add the mainline kernel PPA?), or downgrade to the previous kernel where this was working for you. \nedit: you just confirmed you are using the mainline PPA, in which case purging the PPA and reverting back to the default kernel might fix the issue.\n", "Q: apt-get: how to make it keep old archives locally when upgrading packages I know I can't install previous version without a local copy of the archive of needed version. But today I found out something surprising: I was sure that all previous archives are stored in cache. But after I upgraded firefox from v28 to v29 and checked available versions to install, result is unexpected for me:\n$ apt-cache madison firefox\nfirefox | 29.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main i386 Packages\nfirefox | 29.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 | http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main i386 Packages\nfirefox | 11.0+build1-0ubuntu4 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main i386 Packages\n\nThere is no version 28. I checked /var/cache/apt/archives, and there is actually no archive of version 28. That is sad that it is removed.\nHow can I prevent it from removing old archives?\n\nA: The Apt cache is managed by a daily cron job. To modify the default settings, open (as root) /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20archive:\nAPT::Archives::MaxAge \"30\";\nAPT::Archives::MinAge \"2\";\nAPT::Archives::MaxSize \"500\";\n\nTo disable the automatic removal, set the three values to 0.\nSee the top of of /etc/cron.daily/apt for a brief documentation of these options.\n\nA: From man apt-get\n\nautoclean:\n  Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of retrieved\n  package files. The difference is that it only removes package files\n  that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This allows\n  a cache to be maintained over a long period without it growing out of\n  control. The configuration option APT::Clean-Installed will prevent\n  installed packages from being erased if it is set to off.\n\nCheck what the current value is with apt-config dump|grep Clean\nIn /etc/apt/apt.conf add:\nAPT::Clean-Installed \"false\";\n\nAlso see What is difference between the options “autoclean”, “autoremove” and “clean”?\n", "Q: how to disable alt+w unity binding I can't for the life of me find where it's specified. Oddly I don’t think I’ve had this problem before in unity. When editing in emacs, the alt+w short-cut is vital and every time I press it I get the \"type your command prompt\" instead.\n\nA: Your problem is the alt key. Any combination using it will trigger the HUD. You can use the package compizconfig-settings-manager.\nStep 1 : Install compizconfig-settings-manager by running the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nStep 2 : After installing it, open it and go to \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\". Click on the button for the option Key to show the HUD.\nStep 3 : Click on Grab key combination and press any new key combination and press enter. After that, alt should no longer trigger the HUD.\nAlso, I believe this has been already explained more clearly :\nHow do I modify or disable the HUD's use of the Alt key?\n\nA: AFAIK, Alt+W is not a shortcut in unity. To get the \"Type your command here prompt\". You press the Alt button. I think there is a gap in your typing the Alt and W keys. Try pressing them together faster\n", "Q: MAAS 1.5+bzr2252-0ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 14.04 comissioning scripts fail I am giving a try to MAAS and I have found an issue which I do not know how to tackle.

It is widely used to serve multiple websites from one physical server. Google \"virtual interfaces\" or see e.g. here . The virtual interface can work with or without DHCP independently from the real one. Only it wouldn't be called eth1 but rather eth0:0, in your case.\n", "Q: Cannot restart apache after installing mod_wsgi I am trying to learn python web application development using Ubuntu 12.04.

For 14.04, I'm trying out Lubuntu LTS.\nIf I run ls -l /usr/share/app-install/desktop, I get a list of 3085 .desktop files. All except one are dated Apr 18. The exception is:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  6328 Mar 28  2013 applications.menu\n\nFrom the dates, it's clear that all these are installed by default and not by me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't each GUI-based program bring in its own .desktop file at the time it's installed (mostly in /usr/share/applications)?\n\n*Then why are these thousands of other .desktop files needed? From their names, most of them haven't anything to do with Lubuntu.\n\n*Their names are different from regular .desktop files (such as those in /usr/share/applications): many, not all, are like name:name.desktop whereas the regular ones are just name.desktop.\n\n*The ones I looked at all have a line with X-AppInstall-Popcon=nnn where nnn is a string of digits. I know that Popcon \"gathers statistics determining which packages are the most popular with Ubuntu users\". But why is that part of these .desktop files?\n\n\nA: The .desktop files under /usr/share/app-install/desktop are installed by the app-install-data  package. This package provides metadata about applications that is used by the Ubuntu Software Center and (in your case) the Lubuntu Software Center. The package also contains a copy of each application's icon that is referenced from the .desktop files.\nBasically, these .desktop files are very similar to the .desktop files that are used by your desktop environment's menu for launching applications. However, as you noticed, they have additional metadata added for things like popularity counts and search keywords.\nAnd, as is probably obvious, the app-install-data package installs a full set of .desktop files and icons on all Ubuntu systems regardless of which flavor is installed, which applications are installed by default, or which applications have been installed or removed on a particular system.\nThe purpose of all of this is to give users a polished Software Center experience that provides information about all applications that can be installed in Ubuntu without having to query and cache all of it from a web service. The app-install-data package is built for each Ubuntu release from all known applications that are in the Ubuntu repositories. And that allows the user to open the Software Center, search for applications by name or keyword, and be able to see the same name, description, and icon that will show up in their desktop menu or launcher when they install the application.\nThese metadata files and icons can be removed if you want by simply uninstalling the package that contains them:\nsudo apt-get remove app-install-data\n\nNote that removing app-install-data will in turn force removal of lubuntu-software-center, lubuntu-desktop, software-center, and ubuntu-desktop.

My system:\nOS: Windows 8.1\nBrand: Toshiba Satellite P55t-A\nRAM: 8Gb\nCPU:2.30 Ghz\nHHD: 618Gb Free Space\nPortable HD: 2TB Free Space\nToshiba Canvio Hard Drive.\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu 14 on to  my Portable Hard Drive? If so could you list either a link or the steps to do it. I have it burn on a DVD, when I insert the DVD into my laptop and boot from it. It gives me 3 options, Install, OEM Install and one more I can't remember. I think it was \"try\" or something.  When I clicked on  Install it just started to install. Not sure if that is what's suppose to happen then it gives me the option?\nIf you need any other information  just let me know. jjgremo@gmail.com\nThanks in advance! \n\nA: First, does your system use UEFI or Bios? A quick way to check is to right click on my computer in Windows 8, select manage, disk management. \nIf it reports a 100 mb system reserved partition you are likely using Bios. You can also boot up the UEFI configuration utility and check there (check your laptop key combination online, usually one of the function keys or del/ esc) \nIf it is a new laptop that came with Windows 8 it is almost guaranteed to be set up in UEFI mode with secure boot enabled. I am assuming that it is using UEFI. \nInstalling to an external drive will be quite slow, you are better off installing in a virtual machine (use virtual box). Usually it is easier to disable secure boot to install, however it should work with secure boot enabled. \nif you still want to install to a secondary hdd  perform these steps:\n1-Create a full disk backup of your Windows 8 system (system image)+a repair disk. If you wipe your system by mistake you can always restore. Create system recovery disks also . Note if you make a partitioning mistake you can hose your Windows install completely - you will need to save the system image to another drive/set of dvds. \n2-Boot up the Ubuntu live cd, click install and choose \"something else\" \n3 - you should see a list of disks that Ubuntu has detected . Select your external drive and partition it as follows(assuming you want your Windows 8 and Ubuntu to be completely separate from each other) \nCreate a 1 GB partition named EFIboot. \nCreate another partition with a swap mount point and give it a couple of GB. (4GB should do, or equal your ram) \nCreate a third partition (remaining space using ext4 with a / mount point. \n. At the bottom of the installation screen it will prompt you for the bootloader location - choose your external disk (usually /dev/sdb). \nWhen you need to boot Ubuntu simply plug in the hdd into a USB port and choose boot from USB in UEFI . For booting Windows 8 simply remove the hdd and Windows 8 should boot normally. \nIf your system is using the standard Bios/mbr setup , the steps are identical, but you won't need to create a EFIboot partition when installing. \n", "Q: How to disable terminal fullscreen padding When I run vim at full screen mode in gnome-terminal, actually it is not really full screen.\nThere is a little padding on the right and bottom, with the terminal background color.\nYou can reach the original image to see it more clearly.\n\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: You can't make vim inside the terminal actually full screen, unless you're lucky enough that both the width and the height are multiples of the cell size (plus the fixed UI chrome taken into account).\nThe terminal is a text grid, and if you force it to a maximized size which doesn't match this grid then there's necessarily a margin which is inaccessible to vim.\nYou probably don't realize it with xterm because xterm's background color is the same black as vim's background color; whereas gnome-terminal's is different.\n\nA: I don't know about the CLI version, but there's the gVim VullScreen addon on Github that's pretty nice.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nThere's still the problem of the right scrolling bar. \nAlternatively you can use xTerm but you'll have to patch it and compile it yourself, here's the link.\nAnother option yet would be to use a tty terminal by using the CTRL+ALT+F1 to F6 shortcut, but that's not probably what you were looking for.\n\nA: A partial solution.\nThis will fix the right side padding issue, possibly only for some versions of Gnome.\nIn a custom theme create tweak the gtk style  gtk-3.0/gtk.css with the following:\n/**\n * Fixes some padding issues in Vim + Terminal\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n */\n\nVteTerminal,\nTerminalScreen {\n    border: none;\n    padding: 0 0 0 0;\n    margin: 0 0 0 0;\n    -VteTerminal-inner-border: 0 0 0 0;\n}\n\nFull guide\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gnome-tweak-tool: sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n*Create a file named .themes/galactica/gtk-3.0/gtk.css put the css shown above in it.\n\n*Open the Tweak Tool and set the shell theme to \"Galactica\".\n\n*Restart\n\n", "Q: How can I open Java's Control Panel?

If you aren't ready to simply format it you likely have things you still want to keep. \nWhat are the specs of the cpu, 9 years old puts it into pentium 4 ish days. \nThe default Ubuntu install requires a fairly capable graphics card to even boot, and bearing in mind your laptop is 9 years old I don't think it is feasible. \nCan you try Ubuntu 12.04 alternative install? Thus includes a text based installer (still reasonably simple to use) which ensures that it will most likely boot. I would suggest you start there as that's probably the best chance you have got. \nIf it doesn't boot via the alternative cd above then you will likely have to try another lightweight distro (crunchbang is quite lightweight). \nYou mention that the DVD you burnt is Bootable on a Windows 7 machine.

The only one working is 2.6.31-20, such answer I get when I asked how to build it.\nHow to make chroot with such version of kernel?\n\nA: chroot just uses your current Kernel. That's just how it works. If you need to change the enveloping kernel, you're going to need to virtualise (through something like kvm or VirtualBox)... Or roll your kernel back to the version your chroot is using (though this sounds painful for the versions we're talking about).\nI would personally just look at building for the right script. If you're using DKMS for this, it's fairly simple to just tell it which kernel and arch to build for:\nsudo dkms install nvidia-337 -k 2.6.31-20-generic\n\nThe dkms {remove,build,install,uninstall,status,...} subcommands all take a -k option for specifying the kernel and arch. See man dkms for a bit more information.\nFor a list of the installed kernels, ls /lib/modules should get you moving in the right direction though it may feature kernels that are no longer installed.

If I run Ubuntu and Windows on a single machine in separate partitions, will viruses and other bad migrate between the two operating systems? In other words, will bad stuff under one OS infect the other?\n\nA: Could malware feasibly go from one install to another?\nTo be clear, the malware running on one probably won't run on the other as is... But most malware is more than capable of downloading other malware. That's what most do —by design— to stay alive these days.\nAnd if you can access the other partition, anything else running on your computer can.\nSo any malware in Windows could detect an Ubuntu install, download Ubuntu-specific malware and drop that on the Ubuntu partition.\nHave I ever heard of anything doing this?\nNo... But I haven't heard of a lot of things.\nIf you're doing dodgy things in Windows (or Ubuntu) and you don't want that to affect anything else, seal it off from the world. Wrap it up in some proper virtualisation (eg VirtualBox) and disable any sort of sharing with the rest of the system.\nIf you're just worried about what Windows is doing, just follow the best possible security practices (don't browse dodgy sites, don't download cracked games and applications and use a self-updating browser that isn't IE) and you will probably be fine...\n... Probably. There really are no certainties. Even with Ubuntu.\n\nA: It is possible, but I am unaware of any common examples, the probability is low.\nIf the malware is programmed to recognize other operating systems and write data into the partitions where those OS reside - they could easily look through mounted drives (local or network) search for various executables and inject their code.\nBut Windows is generally not very good at writing to Linux filesystems, which requires the loading of 3rd party drivers, its going to make the malware bulky and easy to detect (or a lot of effort to obfuscate).\nConsidering the low number of malware that target Linux specifically (compared to other OS like Mac/Windows), dual booting is even less popular and not worth the effort.\n", "Q: How to tell javac which libraries to include So I am trying to run a java file from Terminal.

I applied language support \"Japanese\" and it shows up in the language icon at the page top menue. I installed IBus Input Pad, also Mozc. Both show up at the left hand Starter and the programs can be opened, but the field \"apply\" is not highlighted. Problem being: the input is simply not working at all. What else do I have to do?\n\nA: I don't know how you get them installed. I first installed mocz from software center and I didn't work. But the following command works. Press Ctrl + Alt + T to start the terminal, then right click on anywhere in the terminal to paste the command:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-mozc mozc-server mozc-utils-gui\n\nAfter everything is done in the terminal, log out once and try find mozc in Text Entry Settings.\nReference:\nhttp://inokara.hateblo.jp/entry/2013/03/23/091307\n\nA: I just ran into the same problem and this is a really goofy way to fix it but it worked. \nStart terminal and type ibus-setup, which opens up the ibus-preferences. Go to the input method tab and you will be able to add either anthy or mozc from there. The fix is to REMOVE the default \"English\" from the list so all that remains is the IME you added in the previous step (either anthy or mozc), so the system is forced to use it. \nFor anthy, by default you can switch between inputting Japanese and inputting English by hitting Ctrl+J. \n\nA: It took me some time to figure this out, but in the input options, you will find something like \"English\" and \"Japanese\" (in my case with my Japanese keyboard proper ID'ed during install).  However, installing Anthy or Mozc didn't do anything.  \nYou have to go back to the input dialog and add \"Japanese-Anthy\" or \"Japanese-Mozc\".  Then toggle between them.  \nBy the way, 'Super' button is the \"Windows\" button. \nAnd if you are having trouble with keyboard layout, the reason is wrong \"language\" input.  For example, when I have \"En\" selected as input, the keyboard layout is an 'English keyboard layout\"  In order to type English without any curveballs, I toggle to \"Ja\" input and get the Japanese layout.\n\nA: What I had to do was install japanese language support using system settings->language support, use system-settings->text entry to add Japanese Anthy and use the Text Entry on the Language dropdown on the panel to select control+space which I am used to.\nIt took several hours to find the step of adding Japanese Anthy using the system-setings->text.  This step was very un-intuitive.  I finally found it here and recommend this site for getting anthy Japanese input working.\nI expect that using apt-get to install mozc as recommended above and then adding it using system-settings->text entry would add it to the selections but haven't tried it.\n", "Q: Dual boot failed can no longer boot into windows I tried to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu on my DELL laptop.

Can anybody tell me what this does?\nrsync -uva --delete /srv/bkp01 /srv/offbk2/ > ~/offbkp01.log\n\nDoes it delete bkp01 and offbk2 and sends a log to offbkp01.log?\n\nA: From the manual:\n\n--delete\nThis tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones that aren’t on the sending side), but only for the directories that are being synchronized. You must haveasked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. \"dir\" or \"dir/\") without using a wildcard for the directory’s contents (e.g. \"dir/*\") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync thus gets a request to transfer individual files, not the files’ parent directory. Files that are excluded from the transfer are also excluded from being deleted unless you use the --delete-excluded option or mark the rules as only matching on the sending side (see the include/exclude modifiers in the FILTER RULES section).\n\nSo it will delete files from the destination that are not part of the original directory if you did not use wildcards.\nSource directory:\n1.txt\n2.txt\n3.txt\n\nDestination directory:\n4.txt\n\n4.txt will be gone after the rsync and 1.txt, 2.txt and 3.txt will be on the destination.\n\nRegarding the other things:\nuva\n\n\n*\n\n*update files\n\n*verbose: echo results to terminal (ie. redirect it to your log file so yes to the last question)\n\n*archive: archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)\n\n\nA: To break this up into parts, there are two major sections, followed by a summary and notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The rsync command:\nrsync -uva --delete /srv/bkp01 /srv/offbk2/\n\n*the output redirection done by the shell running the rsync command:\nrsync-command > ~/offbkp01.log\n\nrsync command:\nBase command:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync - I assume this needs no explanation (but will provide if requested).\n\n\nCommand options:\n\n\n*\n\n*-uva - A set of single character options, being (short then long form shown):  \n\n\n*\n\n*-u --update - Tells rsync that all modifications should only apply to files on the destination which are the same age (and different sizes) or older than the ones on the source.  That is, rsync should only pass on the changes from the source that would update the destination, but it should not make any changes that would make a destination file become an older version.\nThere are some exceptions.  Differences in type (e.g., one is a file, the other is a directory) will cause an update regardless of dates.  Symlinks and other special files ignore this option.  And, importantly, this does not affect which files get deleted.  \n\n*-v --verbose - Increases the amount of information rsync prints out while executing.  Without this, rsync will print (almost?) nothing.  With this option as-is, rsync will tell you which files are being transferred, and put a summary at the end. More vs increase the information printed, although the man page says more than two vs should only be used when debugging.  \n\n*-a --archive - This is equivalent to several other options (-rlptgD) packaged together.  As the long name suggests, it's a quick way to set many common options for archiving files and directories. It will:\n\n*\n\n*-r --recursive - Tells rsync to copy directories recursively. Without this, or the more particular -d --dirs option, rsync would simply skip any directories it encountered (and tell you about it in its output).  \n\n*-l --links - When the source is a symlink, create a symlink on the destination.  Depending on other options, symlinks may otherwise be skipped or made into a full separate copy (i.e., a true directory with contents (or another copy of the file) instead of the symlink).   \n\n*-p --perms - Sets the permissions of the destination files to the same as the source files.  \n\n*-t --times - Sets the modification times of the destination files to the same as the source files.  Since keeping these times in sync makes the rsync algorithm more efficient, you generally always want this to be used, explicitly or implicitly.  \n\n*-g --group - Sets the group attribute of the destination to the same as the source.  Associates by name by default, but will fall back to group ID number in some circumstances.  If the receiving rsync is not run as super-user (or faking it with --fake-super), only groups that the user who invoked rsync on the receiving side is a member of can be set.  Otherwise, the group will just be set to the default group of the same user mentioned before.  \n\n*-D - Equivalent to the options --devices and --specials together.  They mean:\n\n*\n\n*--devices - Character and block device files are transferred.  Has no effect if the receiving rsync is not run as super-user (or faking it with --fake-super).  \n\n*--specials - Special files (like sockets) are transferred (they otherwise would not be).  \n\n\n\n\n*--delete - Tells rsync to delete files that are on the destination, but not on the source.  This is NOT affected by the update option set above (indeed, how could it be since most file-systems will not retain the needed data to see which action was newer?).  This option acts on the sources after wildcard/glob expansion, so dir/* is not the same as dir/.  Some important notes:\n\n*\n\n*This is, obviously, dangerous. You should probably try it with the --dry-run option first, which will do a pretend transfer that allows you to make sure no unintended changes are made.  \n\n*If there are any I/O (input/output) errors - that is, if anything goes wrong transferring, reading, or writing changes - delete will be ignored from that point on.  This can be overridden with the --ignore-errors option, though you probably don't/won't want to do that.\n\n*There are several variations on the delete algorithm, about which you can read more in the man page.  When the receiving rsync is version 3.0.0 or newer (as of the time of this writing) the --delete-during algorithm is used.  If the receiver is older, then --delete-before is used.  If it's important that the files maintain a certain sort of consistency should an error occur (such as not deleting anything until all other changes are made), you should use a more specific option than the default one.\n\n\n\nCommand locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*/srv/bkp01 - The source file or directory.  There are some detailed rules on what it means if there is/isn't a slash on the end of the directory, and if the other directory exists.  You can see the USAGE section of the man page for the details, but here the lack of a trailing slash means this directory will be copied into the destination, rather than this directory's contents being copied into the destination.  Same if this is a file rather than a directory.\n\n*/srv/offbk2/ - The destination directory.  In general, this will always be the last item listed in the rsync command section unless an option is used to specify it elsewhere in the command.\n\n\n\nShell's output redirection:\nShell commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*> - This redirects stdout (the standard output) from whatever is on the left to the file on the right, becoming its contents, and creating the file (if possible) if it does not already exist.  Some notes:\n\n*\n\n*You can also redirect stderr (the standard error output) to the same file by adding 2>&1 to the very end of the command above.  Order is important, so be careful generalizing where to put that.  The magic number 1 refers to stdout, 2 refers to stderr, & is (essentially) \"the address of\", and the full command snippet means \"redirect the output of stderr into the stdout stream\".  \n\n*If you want to append to the log file instead of replacing it, you can use >> instead.  The method to redirect stderr to the same place remains the same.  \n\n*You can send stdout and stderr to different places by using 1> stdout_file 2> stderr_file.  You can also use >> instead of > in that command to do so by appending instead of replacing.\n\n\n\nShell variables / special symbols:\n\n\n*\n\n*~ - This is shorthand for the current user's home directory, and forms part of the next bit.\n\n\nShell-level locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/offbkp01.log - the file offbkp01.log inside the current user's home directory.  This is where the output of the rsync command will be put because of the redirection with >.\n\n\n\nSummary:\nIn summary, this command will:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all regular files, directories, symlinks, special files, and device files  \n\n*as well as most, if not all, important file attributes,\n\n*from /srv/bkp01,  \n\n*to /srv/offbk2/bkp01,  \n\n*and it will delete anything in /srv/offbk2/ that is not in /srv/bkp01, with the following conditions:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If a regular file, directory, or symlink(?) has a modification time on /srv/offbk2/ that is newer than its modification time on /srv/bkp01, it will not be updated, if both items are still the same type (regular file, directory, or symlink(?)).  \n\n\n*Additionally, rsync will print out some information about what it is doing (specifically, which files are being transferred, and a final summary), which the shell will write into the file ~/offbkp01.log.  That log file will be created anew if it does not already exist, and will be overwritten if it does already exist.  \n\nNB: --fake-super is an option used to cause rsync to simulate super-user activities.  It does this by using the files' extended attributes to store the attributes it could not set without having greater privileges.  The real version of each attribute is set to whatever makes sense given the options and the privileges available.  While this makes it convenient to make some backups even if you don't have super-user privileges, one should also note that it may pose a security risk greater than the use of rsync in general, as the real security attributes may not be set properly, even though the information about them was backed-up.\n\nSource: lots of time working with rsync and reading its man-page.\n\nA: No, it only delete extraneous files from bkp01 directory. \nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*-u, --update -                skip files that are newer on the receiver\n\n*-v, --verbose -               increase verbosity\n\n*-a, --archive -               archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)\n\n\nThe output of rsync -uva --delete /srv/bkp01 /srv/offbk2/ command is send to ~/offbkp01.log file using redirection operator (>) instead to be printed in your terminal.

I'm a newbie to Linux. I installed Mint on an old computer and liked it, I would like to dual boot my HP 255 Ubuntu 12.04 laptop with it if possible. As a complete noob when it comes to doing this, I don't want to break the laptop!! How safe is it to just run the Mint installer from the LiveDVD?\nThanks\nStu\n\nA: I don't know enough details, nor do I have the patience, to go into details, but having installed many simultaneous versions of various distros to try, and often discard, I can tell you that's it's both easy and dangerous, not necessarily in that order.\nThe way to do it is to use a live CD or USB distro (so the system on the disk won't be mounted), and make room for a new partition big enough for a new installation.  The size depends on how serious you want it to be, but usually 20 - 30 GB (or less) is plenty. You can also skip this and let the install do the partitioning, but in my experience, it often doesn't do a good job, or is not that easy to understand.  But I'm sure it can be done.\nHowever you do it, you need to be aware of the fact that, by default, the newest installation will modify GRUB, the bootloader, to boot into the new system, and if you were to delete the new system, your old one won't boot without some TLC.  It's not really serious, but you would be forced to learn about how GRUB works a little, which isn't that easy for the faint of heart.\nIf you are willing and able to learn, you won't break your laptop.  But if not, you will think you have broken it, and for many people, that is the same thing.  Personally, I learn by destroying, so I often just forge ahead and do things that put me in the deep end, but you may not be that type of person.  But once you learn how things work, you will truly control your system, rather than vice versa...  well, more or less. :-)\nIf you proceed, make sure you can boot from a live CD and get internet access.

At the moment all I can do is open a few of the files I saved to my USB. All my Excel and Word files on it cannot be opened though because my trying to improve XP by reinstalling it using the original cd resulted in all the programs I had including Office vanishing. \nI cannot go to any webpages either as essential files are missing. My desktop only has 256 MB of RAM. My technical skills are zero unfortunately. \n\nA: If you only have 256 MB RAM I would use Lubuntu. This is a flavour of Ubuntu that uses the fewest resources. You may even want to try something else than Ubuntu.\n256 MB RAM is really small. Even Windows XP (with all updates) would be really slow. Maybe you can try to upgrade it to 512 MB.\nAlso, some more information about your system would be nice.\nTo install it you'll have to use a CD or USB drive. I think a CD will be the best choice as older systems are usually not able to boot from USB.\nYou can download the ISO from the Lubuntu website and burn it on CD using ImgBurn (or another program that can burn ISO images). Don't just drop the ISO file itself on the CD as it will not be bootable that way.\nThen you'll have to start your computer from the CD. This is usually done by pressing F2 or DEL just after you power on your computer.\nSearch for something called Boot Order and make sure CD is on top. Then save and exit. Your PC will now start from CD.\nJust follow the on-screen instructions. If you have any questions you can leave a comment.\n\nUbuntu has an internet browse (Firefox) and a office suite (LibreOffice: including Word and Excel) built in.\nLibreOffice is not the same as Microsoft Office, but you can view and edit Microsoft Office documents with it.\nI think Ubuntu also has an email client built in (Evolution) but I'm not sure about that. If it hasn't you can always easily install it using the following command in the terminal or use Ubuntu's Software Center:\nsudo apt-get install evolution\n\nI think you'll get used to Ubuntu faster than you think, especially if you're only using internet, email and office.\n\nYou can backup your important files to an USB drive by choosing Try Ubuntu when you boot from your Ubuntu CD (do this before installing Ubuntu).\nUbuntu will start a live environment. Open a file manager and on the left you'll see all your hard disks. Click on Windows to open your Windows files (the name may be different, just try them all).\nYour files will be in Documents and Settings/UserName. You can just drag them to your USB drive.\n\nA: Lubuntu is your best chance considering the low RAM that you have, you can click here to get the latest version which will give you an install disk just like the Windows XP disk you reainstalled with.\nLubuntu is a very simple system, and if you can navigate around Windows XP, then Lubuntu should take little time to learn. \n\nA: With only 256MB of RAM, Ubuntu and it's derivatives ( like Lubuntu ) is not a good choice for your PC. At the moment I can't think of any GNU/Linux distribution that both runs well with as few as 256MB of RAM and is easy to install especially if you don't want all your files to be lost ( if you don't care about those it's much easier ).\nIf all you want is a quick way to use the internet there are some distributions out there that aren't installed to the hard drive but run from a CD (everything that's not saved to an external medium will be lost after reboot ). Those distributions specifically designed for low RAM environments include:\n\n\n*\n\n*TinyCore http://www.tinycorelinux.net/downloads.html\n\n*DamnSmallLinux http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/\nand many others. I'd recommend DamnSmallLinux for your purposes but keep in mind it behaves really differently from Windows XP. If you want to use it, Download the ISO-Image ( ftp://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/dsl-4.4.10.iso ) and burn it onto a CD. Then put it in your pc and boot from it.\nEDIT: From a usability perspective you really should try Lubuntu first. You may have to use the alternate install cd (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Alternate_ISO) though, that is much less easy to handle than the normal installation. In case this doesn't work proceed as described above.\n", "Q: How can I enable edge stop velocity in 14.04?

What is that and what is the usage of that? I see this when I searched for this question and I found freerdp directory on the first answer\n\nA: In the Linux world, configuration files and directories are usually found in your home folder ($HOME, also known as ~/) and are named as .nameoftheprogram. Many are collected in the ~/.config directory (such as ~/.config/google-chrome) and others are in your $HOME itself (like ~/.mozilla).\nThe one you are asking about is the configuration directory for FreeRDP:\n\nFreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol client that implements RDP following the documentation provided under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise.\n\nThat's where your personal FreeRDP settings will be stored.\n\nA: As mentioned above the directory stores configuration information. Specifically it stores in a file called known_hosts, a list of trusted servers (their IP and Authentication Hash Key) to which you had connected to previously. This way each time you attempt to connect to known servers, FreeRDP does not need to perform NLA server authentication. \nFurther, if you wish to install FreeRDP as a server, then you need to copy certain directories to the ~/.config/freerdp directory as mentioned in step 14 here:\nCan FreeRDP be used as server?\n", "Q: Locked out of my account Ok, so I've been messing around with my linux installation, and I've really kind of messed up.\nI changed the ~/.gnomerc to open an application, but there was a problem: after it opened that application, it didn't do anything else.

That will take you to a virtual terminal where you can log in in text mode. \nLog in as your regular user and then simply rename the offending file:\nmv ~/.gnomerc ~/.gnomerc.bad\n\nNow, hit   Alt + F7 (it might be F8) which will take you back to the login screen, log in and everything should be back to normal.\n", "Q: Clear .cache Tracker directory in Ubuntu?

What is recommended to do in order to prevent this cache and tracker folder to grow so much?\n\nA: You can \"pause\" the Gnome Tracker by setting the configuration option org.freedesktop.Tracker.Miner.Files.low-disk-space-limit used by tracker-miner-fs. \nValues indicate if we pause indexing at a percentage of low disk space (0-100% or -1 to disable the check entirely, 3 being the default value).\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t) and type the following command to stop the tracker at 1%:\ngsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker.Miner.Files low-disk-space-limit 1\n\nSource.\n", "Q: Looking for assistance with Graphic Card Dtriver.

Please help me.\n\nA: One of them will say \"Recommended\" to the right, and when you highlight it the description area will say \"tested\" and have a little red ribbon next to it.  Those are generally the ones I pick.\n", "Q: how do I get my computer to boot a specific partition? My computer has an interesting setup... I have a partition layout that goes like this: 30gb ext4 that I want to boot from, 130gb part ext4 with corrupted drivers (mouse and network are completely offline) that I had originally made as a copy of the 30gb and originally wanted to boot to but now is almost beyond repair but I want to use the home folder on this with the 30gb as the root partition, a 140gb ntfs that I want to install windows 7 on for gaming, and a 1gb partition at the start of the drive that I'd like to use as a grub/boot partition. The other interesting but annoying thing is that the two ext4 partitions seem to irregularly alternate upon reboot, and even a grub boot disk sometimes confuses them. I want to make the 130gb partition not boot, but use it as a home partition for the 30gb one, and have the boot loader installed to the 1gb one at the start of the disk for future expantion and flexibility.  \n\nA: You can perform as many installs as you like.  Perform the installs (either Windows or Linux) on which ever partition you want.  As mentioned in the comment above, after any partition, you'll be presented with a boot menu where you can choose which installation you want to boot from.\nYou can tell the partition by selecting the OS with the up/down arrow and hit \"e\" for edit which will present some information about that installation to you.\nYou can also run \"sudo upgdate-grub\" at anytime to have grub search your system to find the various OS installations and add them to the selectable boot menu.\nYou can also edit /etc/default/grub and specify \"grub_default=#\" for your perform default installation to for booting.\nAfter making changes to the /etc/default/grub, you'll have to run \"sudo update-grub\" to install the changes.\n", "Q: How do I have a headless machine share its wireless connection through ethernet?

Hope this helps, :-)\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing\n", "Q: Trying to boot from Windows CD goes to GRUB I am trying to boot from disk using the Windows Installation CD, and I always get the GRUB menu. Here is the boot-repair. Is there any other information you would need? Booting from a GParted disk or an Ubuntu disk works fine.\nI usually select boot from the DVD drive using F12, and I've also changed settings in the BIOS, but I only get the GRUB screen, the same as if I was booting from the hard drive.\nAlso, some background information on Windows issues: Windows crashed and trying to boot in safe mode or normal mode simply restarted the computer. From the GRUB menu the Windows recover option brings me to a stock wallpaper and a mouse I can't move before shutting down. I recently deleted a Windows partition, but the problem existed before this. What would happen if I deleted other Windows partitions?\nI do seem to be having trouble with the disk in another computer.\nIt was simply the disk. I was able to install Windows Vista, but I installed Ubuntu over it as I've come to enjoy the OS.\n\nA: If you are trying to boot a Windows CD, then you should change the boot device order in the BIOS. It has nothing to do with the GRUB boot-repair. If it's not booting then it's a problem with your Windows CD or the system hardware.\nTo change the boot device order in your BIOS, you should press Esc or some function key based on your system at the beginning of the boot process.\n\nA: You might have damaged the Master Boot Record (which is what Windows uses, while Linux  typically uses a /boot partition).\nWindows is easy to damage if not shut down properly (such as a power outage). It might also be worth running a physical disk utility to check HD integrity.\nIf your CD/DVD drive boots other disks and can read the contents of your rescue disk - then I don't suspect that your drive is bad. But perhaps the rescue disk wasn't properly created (will it boot on someone else's Win8 machine)?\nLastly, resizing a windows partition can get tricky. But deleting a Windows partition is a sure way to break the OS.  It may be much easier to purchase a second internal HD, and have each OS segregated for dual-boot, but it is by no means required.  Read through the Ubuntu forums and there are a few people who have had similar issues before you.\n\nA: Make sure your Windows CD/DVD is bootable.\nCheck your BIOS screen to get into the Boot Menu (F8 for example for some boards). Press the identified key while the motherboard splash shows up.\nYou should see at least 3 to 4 options like boot from HDD, boot from CD, etc.\nHighlight boot from CD and press Enter.\nIf the above doesn't get you into the Windows installation screen, check the DVD in any other computer. I doubt the CD is not bootable.\n\nA: Try booting the windows CD/DVD on some other computer and see if it boots as it looks like the CD/DVD was not burnt correctly.\nAlso see if you can boot into Windows install wizard using a USB Drive. Use USB install media creator such as YUMI to do so.\n", "Q: Dual boot 14.04 alongside Win8 So I'm running a fresh install of Win8 on a 60gb SSD with a another 300HDD for storage. I have set a 20gb space for the installation of Ubuntu alongside Win.

I put account disabled . And now my laptop ask me for a password to upgrade. But the password i used is not the same. Says it is incorrect. What is the password if the account is disabled\n\nA: Account disabled means account disabled. No password is valid for a disabled account. You can however reset it to re-activate it. How do I reset a lost administrative password?\n", "Q: Will encrypting hard drive encrypt \"deleted\" data When a file is \"deleted\" it is not truely deleted, of course. I was on windows 8.1.\nAnyway, I accidentally screwed something up which led to more screw-ups which led to an unbootable hard drive and the \"deletion\" of all my files (I'm sure those files are not truly erased). Fortunately, I had a Ubuntu cd lying around to install a new OS. Upon installation, I used the native disk encryption and chose a 20+ character password. I did not select \"overwrite hard drive\" because I was afraid it would take too long. It didn't take too long to install and restart, so I'm wondering whether a secure encryption algorithm was used (Trucrypt takes much longer). Most importantly, I had about 200GB+ data on my hard drive before this and I am wondering if those \"deleted\" files are also encrypted. In other words are those \"deleted\" files safe even though they were from a bygone era and different OS. I mean how could it have encrypted all those hidden files so fast? \nI immediately used bleach bit to delete all \"free space,\" but IDK man you can't be sure.\n\nA: Full disk encryption\nIf you use full disk encryption and you wait for it to fill the entire volume with random data (which may take hours on a large drive) then yes, previous deleted files will be gone and replaced with random data - for that partition.  Data may still remain in other partitions or unpartitioned space if any.\nFuture files you delete will be recoverable only with the same decryption key.\nIf it didn't take hours to create the encrypted volume then most likely it didn't fill the volume with random data and previously deleted files may still be there.\nIn this case using other software to fill all unused space with random data will suffice, especially if it does \"free space\" and \"cluster tips\".  Doing this with zeroes or semi-random data is not recommended as it can aid in cryptanalysis, but at least your previously deleted files will be gone.\nNote that for modern SSDs with wear-levelling, wiping/writing random data to the entire disk may not entirely wipe all old data as the SSD keeps additional data blocks and swaps data around.\nFile based encryption\nFile based encryption, such as when you encrypt your home directory only, only operates per-file.  Old deleted files that weren't encrypted won't be touched.  Again you can improve privacy by wiping free space using other software.\n", "Q: How to contact Canonical? So I am doing a College research project for my Computer Information Systems department and it is about alternative Linux server distribution for small businesses. From my findings I would really like for this research to actually take off into a Distribution project (Using Ubuntu as a base OS). \nHowever I would like to rename the distribution as \"Bizbuntu\" or something related to that (\"Biz\" being shorthand for business) however I don't know if I can name the distribution without consent from Canonical. \nSo my question is do I have to contact Canonical about this, if so, does anyone know a mailing list or email that I can contact them about this? \n\nA: After reading this: http://www.canonical.com/intellectual-property-rights-policy\nPart 7 has \"Contact us\": http://www.canonical.com/intellectual-property-rights-policy/contact-us\n\nA: Have you visited the Canonical web site?

Powershot S95 in Ubuntu 14.04 and used gphotofs for a work-around. In a terminal I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gphotofs:\n$ sudo apt-get install gphotofs\n\n*then mount your camera, which I did under /tmp/camera\n$ mkdir /tmp/camera/\n$ gphotofs /tmp/camera/\nThat is it. \nIf gphotofs worked /tmp/camera/ should now be connected to your camera (check using either the terminal or nautilus). Lastly if you are using a photo manager like shotwell, use an `import from folder' option to access your pictures.\nWhen you are finished importing your pictures you can unmount the camera folder:\n$ fusermount -u /tmp/camera/\n\nA: Already had tried that and it didn't work.  Also tried several other things including modifying the databases.  As it turns out, a recent update fixed the problem - the thread on launchpad explains everything that has been happening to myself and others, and supposedly what the fix is/was.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 bad taint on XFS and BTRFS I've done a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 on a physical machine and a virtual machine and after the first reboot (and also at random times) on the screen I get a bad taint message for XFS and BTRFS modules.\nI don't currently have any XFS or BTRFS FS's but would like to.\nCan someone tell me what this means, if it is safe to use the system like this, and if there is a way to stop these error messages?\n\nA: It seems you have some Oracle software installed. Or something around. If your fresh install was merged to old home it might be some old Oracle configuration file with large data filesystems support. Ubuntu did not shipping natively these filesystems and that suggested to the user installs foremost with reliably ext3/ext4.\n", "Q: How is entropy gathered for /dev/random in Precise With a standard install of Ubuntu 12.04 how is the entropy for /dev/random gathered.\nIs the install smart enough set up any hardware generation available, will it use user based sources like keyboard interupts by default?\nEdit: Just to be clear, I'm looking for the specific configuration that comes with the install (or how to find it), I'm not looking how it might be done in theory.\n\nA: This is complicated question. I will answer by quoting from few sources.\nFrom Linux manpage\n\nThe character special files /dev/random and /dev/urandom (present\n  since Linux 1.3.30) provide an interface to the kernel's random number\n  generator. File /dev/random has major device number 1 and minor device\n  number 8. File /dev/urandom has major device number 1 and minor device\n  number 9.\nThe random number generator gathers environmental noise from device\n  drivers and other sources into an entropy pool. The generator also\n  keeps an estimate of the number of bits of noise in the entropy pool.\n  From this entropy pool random numbers are created.\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 default kernel is 3.11.\nFrom wiki\n\nThe Linux kernel generates entropy from keyboard timings, mouse\n  movements, and IDE timings and makes the random character data\n  available to other operating system processes through the special\n  files /dev/random and /dev/urandom. This capability was introduced in\n  Linux version 1.3.30.\n\nFrom Linux manpage\n\nWhen read, the /dev/random device will only return random bytes within\n  the estimated number of bits of noise in the entropy pool. /dev/random\n  should be suitable for uses that need very high quality randomness\n  such as one-time pad or key generation. When the entropy pool is\n  empty, reads from /dev/random will block until additional\n  environmental noise is gathered.\n\nQuote from random sources, from kernel 3.11.10.10\n * Theory of operation\n * ===================\n *\n * Computers are very predictable devices.  Hence it is extremely hard\n * to produce truly random numbers on a computer --- as opposed to\n * pseudo-random numbers, which can easily generated by using a\n * algorithm.  Unfortunately, it is very easy for attackers to guess\n * the sequence of pseudo-random number generators, and for some\n * applications this is not acceptable.  So instead, we must try to\n * gather \"environmental noise\" from the computer's environment, which\n * must be hard for outside attackers to observe, and use that to\n * generate random numbers.  In a Unix environment, this is best done\n * from inside the kernel.\n *\n * Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard\n * timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other\n * events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an\n * outside observer to measure.  Randomness from these sources are\n * added to an \"entropy pool\", which is mixed using a CRC-like function.\n * This is not cryptographically strong, but it is adequate assuming\n * the randomness is not chosen maliciously, and it is fast enough that\n * the overhead of doing it on every interrupt is very reasonable.\n * As random bytes are mixed into the entropy pool, the routines keep\n * an *estimate* of how many bits of randomness have been stored into\n * the random number generator's internal state.\n\nYes it is smart enough to use user based sources, but you can configure more if you want.\nThere are kernels with random generators that have more entropy sources such including noise on audio inputs and others like video, coolers censors, etc. Look here if interesting in audio entropy. I hope you will find others kernels by yourself.\nBut /dev/random should be enough for most tasks by default.\nAlso read this question on stackoverflow\n\nA: True randomness comes from the physical world, not from deterministic pseudo-random number generators. The Linux kernel collects random timings and adds information to its entropy pool. I would recommend going into the kernel sources\nInput entropy refer to the the function call's:\nadd_interrupt_randomness(irq) handlers registered SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM, timing between interrupts is the source of noise, add_keyboard_randomness(scancode) and add_mouse_randomness(mouse_data) ===> all these functions call add_timer_randomness()\nOutput entropy:\nKernel space:\n    [get_random_bytes(buf, number)](\nRefer to LXR => linux/drivers/char/random.c)\nUser space:\n    /dev/random\n    /dev/urandom\nRefer to LXR => linux/drivers/char/random.c\n", "Q: Tried FGLRX and other question's answers, graphics still not working right. (12.04) I've tried every suggestion that I've looked at online. My card is a Radeon HD 4250. I've installed fglrx to no avail. After install I just either go into low graphics mode or it will detect my card as VESA: RS880 and none of my games will work that use 3D. I've done terminal install of fglrx and even used AMD's site, both of which do not work. I looked into jockey and Additional Drivers and it shows nothing. I'm not sure what's going on, but my old roommate had it working at one point. I did a fresh install and cannot figure out how to get it back to playing games. \nI'd appreciate any help or anyone pointing me in the right direction. As I said, I've tried everything I can search so far and nothing has helped, hence the new question.\n\nA: AMD has dropped support in their proprietary driver for that card. You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall fglrx drivers and use the open source radeon driver (Recommended)\n\n*Use the AMD Catalyst Legacy PPA\n\n\nNote that for (2), your X server will be downgraded to support the older 13.1 fglrx driver.

The fact that you can boot to Windows means that the Windows boot loader is present. I have two suggestions.\nFirst, you could edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file. Create an entry that resembles the following:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8.1\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nYou may need to change (hd0,gpt1) to (hd0,gpt2) or some other value, though, depending on the partition number of your EFI System Partition (ESP). Once you've created that entry, type sudo update-grub to update your main GRUB configuration file. When you reboot and select Linux from the firmware's boot manager, Windows should appear as an option.\nAnother possibility is to try my rEFInd boot manager. I recommend doing this by first trying the CD-R or USB flash driver version, available on the program's downloads page. rEFInd should give you options for both Linux and Windows. If both work, then install the Debian package, which should then take over as your primary boot manager.\n", "Q: How do you use Notify OSD in Razor Qt?

I don't want to lose anything because of an accidental rm. Is there a way of creating a trashbin for my server? I know it sounds stupid, but I just want to know whether there's a way of recovering stuff if I accidentally delete files. \nI thought about adding a new alias for rm, but this won't always work. I sometimes use SFTP package of Sublime, and I also can accidentally delete stuff using it. \nWhat can I do? \nThank you very much in advance. \n\nA: If you add an alias to ~./bashrc you can prevent deleting of files. You can alias the command from the answer from Timothy Duane with\nalias rm='trash-put'\n\nAlternative: \nalias rm='mv --verbose -f --backup=numbered --target-directory ~/.Trash/'\n\nwill mv files to your local Trash and also create backups if there is already a file with the same name. \nIf you want the alias globally:  add it to /etc/bashrc.\n\nA: First of all, you don't want to change the behavior of rm globally. That will simply break your system1. Many programs call rm internally so if you change how that behaves they wont' work and this can have unexpected consequences. You will have to limit yourself to protecting yourself from rm. \nYou can, however, add an alias to rm, changing its behavior, to your ~/.bashrc. For ssh sessions, you would normally need to add it to your .profile instead but the default Ubuntu .profile calls .bashrc so that son't be necessary unless you've changed it yourself. Basically, if you don't know what I'm talking about, just use ~/.bashrc. The delete command in an FTP session is something completely different and will not be affected.\nSo, that said, here are a few aliases you could use:\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -i and rm -I\nAs explained in man rm, these two flags protect you from inadvertently deleting files. You can use either, depending on the level of annoyance protection you want:\n-i     prompt before every removal\n\n-I     prompt once before removing  more  than  three  files,  or  when\n       removing  recursively.  Less intrusive than -i, while still giv‐\n       ing protection against most mistakes\n\nSo, for example, to have rm prompt you before each deletion, add this line to ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile`:\nalias rm='rm -i'\n\n\n*Install something like trash-cli as already suggested and then make rm an alias to it:\nalias rm='trash-put'\n\nNow, any files you delete with rm will be placed in ~/.local/share/Trash/files/.\n\n*Use the do-it-yourself approach with mv as suggested by @Rinzwind. \n\n1 Depending on how exactly you change its behavior, it might be fine, but it might break. \n\nA: trash-cli might suit your needs\nsudo apt-get install trash-cli\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/02/make-rm-move-files-to-trash-instead-of.html\nEdit:\nYou could also make a backup of rm and then replace all occurrences of rm with a script\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nfrom sys import argv\nfrom subprocess import Popen\nargs = ''\nfor arg in argv[1:]:\n    args += arg + ' '\nPopen('trash '+args, shell=True)\n\nand then use \nchmod +x rm\n\nAlthough I have no idea how safe this really is.\n\nA: All the proposed answered will work for your command line experience. But let me chime in with my personal suggestion: do not do that. Never.  \nRationale: you should know what are you doing; using rm thinking that there is a safety net (with an alias, a global change in the executable(1), other things) will make you grow confident and you will make big mistakes when the safety net for whatever reason is not present --- that can be an update, another system, or whatever. \nThe rm command is a (complex) shell around the unlink() family of system calls --- see it as the linux kernel service that disposes of files(2). Many programs will just use the system call, completely bypassing your safety nets. \nFor example, the command \nfind . -name test2.aux -delete \n\nwill directly call unlink, as you can see by using strace on it: \nstrace find . -name test2.aux -delete \n...\nunlinkat(AT_FDCWD, \"test2.aux\", 0)      = 0\n...\n\n...and I bet the SFTP server will do the same. These are out of scope to the \"protection\" of your alias or even the rm binary substitution. \nEven a simple mv, cp, or > file can destroy a file outside your safety net. \nThe only safe is a good backup(3). Learn to do it often, and double check all your commands. Triple if running as root. \n\nFootnotes:\n(1) don't do that, unless the replacement command is ready to accept exactly all the flags and corner conditions that rm manage. \n(2) much more complex than that, really.\n(3) or doing that at kernel level, probably by using a filesystem that has some kind of long term memory (a versioning filesystem). I remember working with VMS in the late '80s --- the filesystem did remember all version of a file appending a \";1\", \";2\" etc at the name, at kernel level. Handy but a maintenance nightmare. \n", "Q: how to mount .vhdx image in lubuntu So, I had a hard drive with Windows 8.\nThe drive started dying, so I made an image backup to an external HDD.\nBecause it's practically impossible to get an ISO of Windows 8, I installed Lubuntu.  \nNow I'm restoring the backup and moving my files into Lubuntu, but can't figure out how to mount a .vhdx image.  How do I do this?\n\nA: Here are examples for a file that is called myvhdxfile.vhdx that is mounted to /mnt/vhdxdrive\nExample 1. Where guestmount is inspecting (-i) the disks looking for an operating system and mount filesystems:\n\n*\n\n*Install sudo apt-get install libguestfs-tools\n\n*Create a mountpoint e.g. sudo mkdir /mnt/vhdxdrive\n\n*Run sudo guestmount --add myvhdxfile.vhdx -i --rw /mnt/vhdxdrive\n\n*(optional when you are done inspecting the files) To unmount run sudo guestunmount /mnt/vhdxdrive\nExample 2. If you run into the error: guestmount: no operating system was found on this disk you can mount individual partitions by following these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo guestfish --rw -a myvhdxfile.vhdx\n\n*Type in run and hit enter\n\n*Type in list-filesystems and hit enter and note the path to the partition\n\n*Type in exit and hit enter\n\nThe output of the above steps might look like this:\n><fs> run\n><fs> list-filesystems \n/dev/sda2: ntfs\n><fs> exit\n\nFinally, you can mount the partition /dev/sda2 by running:\n\n*\n\n*sudo guestmount --add myvhdxfile.vhdx --rw /mnt/vhdxdrive -m /dev/sda2\nIf you got a different partition path from running the list-filesystems command in guestfish than you should replace /dev/sda2 with this path in the above command.\nExample 3.\nIf you want the mounted partition to pup up in files (nautilus) and be able to access it with your personal user account:\n\n*\n\n*Create a mountpoint in media sudo mkdir /media/vhdxdrive\n\n*Mount with user permissions sudo guestmount --add myvhdxfile.vhdx -o uid=1000 -o gid=1000 -o allow_other --rw /media/vhdxdrive -m /dev/sda2\nChange the uid and gid values to the corresponding ids of your user in above command.\n", "Q: Eclipse not working: Exec format error I have installed Eclipse as following:\n1 → Download eclipse-standard-kepler-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz to my 14.04\n\n2 → Extracted it using the command,\nsudo tar -xvf eclipse-standard-kepler-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz\n\n3 → Moved eclipse to /opt/ using command,\nsudo mv eclipse /opt/\n\n4 → Created Icon(64x64) for eclipse using GIMP Image Editor.\n5 → Installed gnome-panel using,\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\n\n6 → And Create Application by using,\nsudo gnome-desktop-item-edit /usr/share/applications/ --create-new\n\n\n7 → Select Icon,\n\n8 → Select eclipse application for comment,\n\n9 → Finally enter command and click OK.\n\nI have given everything required, and the application created and showing,\n\nBut when I open this application it's not working.\n(Note: I have created another one, because first one not worked, and now both not working.

In this case you downloaded the 64bit version but should use the 32bit version of Eclipse.\n\nA: \nwhen I tried to open in terminal, am getting  bash: /opt/eclipse/eclipse: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\n\nThat means the file is damaged. Perhaps something went wrong while you did extraction.

Download this file into the same directory as the appropriate tar.gz file.\n\n*Execute the command md5sum -c <gzfilename>.md5.

Then any other devices I connects to this router, whether router on internet or not, I get to access this portable ubuntu anytime and view my emails anytime.\nHere are the main highlights I need to achieve:\n\n\n*\n\n*aggregate emails from different pop-based mail accounts to the\nimap server\n\n*separate emails by account and categorize them in\nview (message filters) \n\n*keep # of downloaded mail count per\nretrieval per email account \n\n*port existing pst, dbx and\nthunderbird mails to this portable ubuntu \n\n*view these emails from web UI \n\n*possibly SMTP (optional if DNS is required)\n\n\nAfter some studies in stackexchange and internet tutorials, I think the following may work but unsure:  nginx, dovecot, mysql, php-fpm, getmail4, roundcubemail. The intent for dovecot is imap server, with web interface served by roundcubemail. Using getmail4 to retrieve mails into imap server, then using roundcubemail to access them.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to implement message filtering (pt.2 above)?\n\n*if they are within private network, can I skip DNS setup, and access my portable server via IP or hostname set in dnsmasq within my private network router?\n\n*how to configure getmail4 to aggregate mails from different accounts and set them up so I could view them like the account profile in thunderbird client?\n\n*what is the best way to convert pst and dbx into mbox or maildir readable by dovecot?\n\n*how to port thunderbird mbox mail into dovecot?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Message filtering is performed by pidgeonhole - dovecot's plugin that realize sieve-engine. RoundCube have a corresponding plugin managesieve\n\n*Yes, you can omit full-scale DNS if you want\n\n*You can create account profile and then route certaing messages in it by message filter (#1)\n", "Q: Can I recover a Bitlocker-encrypted disk without the key? I have encrypted an external drive using Bitlocker on windows 7, I have lost the recovery key and since upgraded my PC with a new motherboard and processor. i have tried everything imaginable to recover my data, I have used passware etc and other forensic software packages but no joy. I have turned to Ubuntu to hopefully resolve my issue. \nWhere I am at the moment is that I have installed the external hard drive directly on to my machine and have loaded Ubuntu rev 14.04. Ubuntu recognises the drive in the disk management section but will not mount it.\nAre there any packages I can use to decrypt my drive? Any help (in basic instructions please !! pardon my ignorance) would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You'd need to get a recovery key from Microsoft and then do the recovery in Windows.\nIf you didn't set up a recovery key, your future is a lot more bleak. Here's the snip from the MS Bitlocker recovery FAQ:\n\nUnfortunately, if you can’t find your key, and no other administrator on the PC can find a backup copy either, you’ll need to restore the PC to factory default settings. Only choose this option as a last resort because it will delete your personal data from the PC. While it helps protect your data against unauthorized access, it also prevents you from ever accessing your data again.\n\nBitlocker is proper strong encryption.\nYou aren't going to crack it without a key in your lifetime.  \nNothing in Ubuntu will change that.\n", "Q: OpenVPN setup with PIA - Connects but no internet Currently using Ubuntu Server 14.04 (so no GUI, all terminal) sitting inside VirtualBox, and am currently trying to get it to connect to Private Internet Access using their VPN configs found here (which can be downloaded without an account for those wanting to take a look at their opvm files).\nAfter downloading and extracting the zip file, I run for example \"sudo openvpn --config France.opvm\".

Ping doesn't work and simply times out. What is it I'm doing wrong that doesn't allow me to have a connection? Any help is appreciated. \n\nA: You have to add redirect-gateway to your configuration (or use openvpn --redirect-gateway):\n--redirect-gateway [local] [def1]\n    (Experimental) Automatically execute routing commands to cause all outgoing IP traffic to be redirected over the VPN.\n\n    This option performs three steps:\n\n    (1) Create a static route for the --remote address which forwards to the pre-existing default gateway. This is done so that (3) will not create a routing loop.\n\n    (2) Delete the default gateway route.\n\n    (3) Set the new default gateway to be the VPN endpoint address (derived either from --route-gateway or the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified).\n\n    When the tunnel is torn down, all of the above steps are reversed so that the original default route is restored.\n\n    Add the local flag if both OpenVPN servers are directly connected via a common subnet, such as with wireless. The local flag will cause step 1 above to be omitted.\n\n    Add the def1 flag to override the default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 rather than 0.0.0.0/0. This has the benefit of overriding but not wiping out the original default gateway.\n\n    Using the def1 flag is highly recommended, and is currently planned to become the default by OpenVPN 2.1.\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu Requirements I plan to install Xubuntu on my CPU that has the following specs:\nIntel Pentium(R) 4 2.26 GHz, 1.00 GB of RAM.\nWould the Xubuntu Trusty Tahr support my CPU or do I have to use the Precise Pangolin version?\n\nA: You can safely go with Trusty. My CPU is a lot older, and it runs it pretty well.\nBe aware however that to my knowledge there are still unfixed bugs with Trusty in relation to power management on laptops.\n", "Q: Is there any alternative for Zoomit on Ubuntu? The drawing mode provided by zoomit is wonderful during a presentation. Is there any software on Ubuntu that provides the same functionality? \n\nA: Gromit-MPX\nYou might want to give Gromit-MPX (which I authored) a try:\n\nGromit-MPX is an on-screen annotation tool that works with any Unix desktop environment under X11 as well as Wayland.\n\nIt's hotkey-based so there are no widgets in your way. Also, you can configure colors, mouse button mappings and hotkeys. No zooming though, only annotations. Go here for details.\nYou can install it through Flathub.\n\nA: If you have Ubuntu, you should have compiz, so use compizconfig-settings-manager to turn on some plugins. This manager is in software-center with plugins too.\nWhen you will have some problems with crashing of compiz because your testing, install fusion-icon to quick reloading it.\ncompizconfig-settings-manager can be launched by command ccsm.\nAnnotate (under Extras): Drawing on the screen.\n\nEnhanced Zoom Desktop (under accessibility): Does that zoom.\n\nSet-up shortcut as you like and enjoy. :)\n\nA: in Settings, the Universal Access dialog, there is a Zoom feature that you can toggle on and off.  I creates a big preview window, dynamically updated with the content on the current desktop.\nHowever I cannot really recommend that Zoom feature. I have a dual-monitor setup with different resolutions, and there the preview window is either to big or to unrespnsive, or difficult to turn back off.\n\nA: In Linux Mint KDE there are:\nMeta= to magnify\nMeta- to reduce magnification\nMeta0 to go back to normal  \nThey are under KWin shortcuts in settings.\nI understand that is no ZoomIt, but I haven't found anything close. Most software is just a window showing a magnification which is quite useless during presentations.\nI understand that it's not Ubuntu either but, it's close and maybe Ubuntu has similar settings.\n\nA: Check out \"Shutter\".  It's in the repos.

So the other day I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS at home in a partition next to Windows 7.  As I'm not able to be at home to watch the Sailplane Grand Prix live as streamed on YouTube, I decided to use livestreamer (http://livestreamer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to save it to a file using its -o option.\nThis works fine (I think - test is running today and I'll see what it looks like when I get home tonight) except that I have to start the command before leaving home in the morning, and the broadcast only starts around mid day, leading to some wasted bandwidth in the morning.\nSo the obvious thing is to use cron to schedule it, right?  Only, when running it from cron it never creates the output file.  The cron line I use is this: \n38 23 13 05 * ./getfaisgpstream 2> /home/me/getfaisgpstream.log\n\nLike I say, the time comes and goes, and the file /home/me/faisgp20140513 does not appear like it does when running livestreamer from the terminal.  I know about the issue where crontab lines need to end in a newline, and I purposefully left a blank line at the bottom of the file to cater for that.\nI used crontab -e to change the cron file.\nThe output I get in \"getfaisgpstream.log\" is: \n./getfaisgpstream: 6: ./getfaisgpstream: livestreamer: not found\n\nThe contents of the file \"./getfaisgpstream\" is:\necho \necho ======= livestreamer script running to get FAI SGP 2014 stream and save it in home: [`date`]\necho \n\nwhile true; do \n  livestreamer --hds-timeout 300 --hls-timeout 300 --rtmp-timeout 300 --http-timeout 300 --http-stream-timeout 300 -fo /home/me/Videos/faisgp`date +%Y%m%d` http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmy5VHAvNMg best\n  echo ======= livestreamer terminated, restarting [`date`]\n  echo; done\n\necho \necho ======= livestreamer script exiting [`date`]\necho \n\nAnd yes this makes it too robust - but whatever, I'm after a simple hack right now that will solve this for recording the broadcast tomorrow.\n\nA: I found the answer to my question: cron does not get the same environment variables that your terminal does.\nIt certainly doesn't get your home folder as starting working directory.  Therefore, saying...\n./getfaisgpstream\n\n...does not work.  What you need to do instead, is:\n/home/me/getfaisgpstream\n\nSince it also does not get the same path that you do in your terminal, saying...\nlivestreamer --hds-timeout 300 ...\n\n... does not work either.  What you need to do instead, is:\n/usr/local/bin/livestreamer\n\n", "Q: Run last command with all the letters transformed to lowercase Many times I have run a command with all the letters in uppercase (maybe because CapsLock was on), and I pressed Enter before realising this.\nHow can I run the last command with all the letters transformed to lowercase?\n\nA: `echo  !! | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`\nThe key is in the ` (backticks) quotations - which runs the output as a command.\n\nA: here comes a programmers answer.... use python:\n`echo \"print '!!'.lower()\" | python`\n\nOr Ruby:\n`echo \"print '!!'.downcase\" | ruby`\n\nOr Perl (probably my favorite):\n`perl -e \"print lc('!!');\"`\n\nOr PHP:\n`php -r \"print strtolower('!!');\"`\n\nOr Awk:\n`echo \"!!\" | awk '{ print tolower($1) }'`\n\nOr Sed:\n`echo \"!!\" | sed 's/./\\L&/g'`\n\nOr Bash:\nstr=\"!!\" ; ${str,,}\n\nOr zsh\necho \"A='!!' ; \\$A:l\" | zsh\n\nOr NodeJS if you have it:\n`echo \"console.log('!!'.toLowerCase());\" | node`\n\nYou could also use dd (but I wouldn't!):\n `echo \"!!\" | dd  conv=lcase 2> /dev/null`\n\nYou could also create a small script to do the job:\nsudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /usr/local/bin/lower\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport fileinput\nprint \"\".join(fileinput.input()).lower(),\nEOF' && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lower\n\nWhich you use like so:\n`echo !! | lower`\n\n\nA: You can accomplish that by adding the following small function (I call it ?? to be very simple, but you can change this as you wish) in your .bashrc file:\n?? () { \"${@,,}\"; }\n\nNext, when you will run:\n?? !!\n\nthe last command will be run with all the letters to lowercase.\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*!! :  this is part of bash's history tools, specifically, it expands to the last command run. So, for example, echo !! will print out the last command run in this particular shell session.\n\n*\"${@,,} : The construct ${foo,,} will convert the contents of the variable $foo converted to all lowercase letters. $@ is the array of positional parameters.  When used inside a function, it is expanded to the parameters passed to that function.\n\n\nSo, \"${@,,}\" will simply convert whatever was passed to the function into lowercase and then execute it. Therefore, running the ?? function with !! as a parameter will convert the last command to lowercase and run it. \n\nA: And the one with sed,\n$(echo !! | sed 's/^\\(.*\\)$/\\L\\1/g')\n\nExample:\n$ SUDO APT-GET UPDATE\nSUDO: command not found\n$ $(echo !! | sed 's/^\\(.*\\)$/\\L\\1/g')\n\nOutput:\n$(echo SUDO APT-GET UPDATE | sed 's/^\\(.*\\)$/\\L\\1/g')\n[sudo] password for avinash: \n0% [Waiting for headers] [Waiting for headers] [Waiting for headers] [Connectin^\n\n", "Q: Launcher duplicate iconless icon As from the screenshot below, there is a duplicate icon of the xfig program. Sometimes with different programs same thing happens.\n\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n\nA: There can be different causes for an application icon, to show up with a question mark (or otherwise incorrectly) in the Unity launcher. \nTo start with: application icons are defined in the .desktop file of an application. These .desktop files are (normally) stored in /usr/share/applications, or ~/.local/share/applications \nCommon causes are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The link to the icon, as defined in the .desktop file of the application, is broken; the icon does not exist or is in the wrong path. effect: the application shows up in the launcher with an incorrect icon (grey question mark). \n\n*The application is represented by more then one .desktop file. That is: there is more then one .desktop file on your system, with a command to run the application in its first Exec= line. effect: many times, Dash shows more than one (correct) icon, representing the same application. When the application is locked to the launcher, sometimes (or always) if the application runs, another icon appears (the same or slightly different).\n\n*For various reasons, sometimes the application and the launcher icon are not connected to each other. Although the application is started by the (command in) the .desktop file, the application is not recognized by the .desktop file as \"his\" application effect: If the application is locked to the launcher, it shows a correct icon, but another one appears when the application runs (grey question mark). If the application is not locked to the launcher, the application is represented by an incorrect icon in the launcher if it runs. (grey question mark, since the binary file has no icon of itself).\n\n\nIn the case of Xfig, the last is the case. You can fix the issue in by adding the following line to the .desktop file:\nStartupWMClass=xfig\n\n\n\n*\n\n*open the application's file (xfig.desktop) with gedit: \ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/xfig.desktop (you may have to install gksu first)\n\n\n*Add the line:\nStartupWMClass=xfig\n\nNow Xfig will run under its own icon:\n\n", "Q: How to make the port free; already used by Drupal ?

I was running 12.04 LTS before and followed the advice that upgrades should be done in steps. I first upgraded to 12.10, which seemed to work fine, and later to 13.10. This was all done through the Software Manager. After the last upgrade, I am no longer able to boot up my computer. The GNU GRUB menu opens up, but after selecting Ubuntu, it just stalls with a blank purple screen. If I select one of the other kernels, it also stalls after \"Loading initial ramdisk...\". I can't get into the Recovery Menu, either. I'm still rather new to Linux and may have possibly made the situation worse. Unfortunately, nothing has worked yet.\nI tried reinstalling from a flash drive and on my first attempt, the wizard recognised a previous installation. Unfortunately, the wizard also didn't like how my partitions were set up (I didn't change anything) and gave an error before closing. Unfortunately, I didn't write the error down, but it was about the boot partition. On the next attempt and ever since, the installation wizard has stated that \n\n\"This computer currently has no detected operating systems.\"\n\nThis is strange, because I could see the disk and even access my files when booting up from the USB. At this point, I decided to back up my important files using dropbox. Before losing all my files, I wanted to try the Boot-Repair tool, which also produced no results, and the files are no longer visible when booting from USB.

Now, take it for what it's worth, I'm no expert, but I would change partition type of sda2 to ext4(/). Be advised, if no OS is detected, and you carry on with the installation as is, it will run a full install, potentially over-writing any files on the drive. My advice would be to make a backup of pertinent files, then run a clean install.\n", "Q: Unable to install ntfs-config I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

The reason is that your program would expect to be able to access its files using standard syscalls, and if you have those files packed inside an archive, they will not be visible to Linux.\nWhat you can do is use makeself to make a single self-extractable executable archive. Then your user would run the executable, it would extract the files from the archive, and then the user can run the installed program.\nAnother alternative, since you are using Java, is to pack files inside the .jar archive, and restructure your code. Then you could distribute the single .jar file and the user run it with java -jar.\n", "Q: Will I loose data or software when upgrading the kernel and/or OS version? I have a doubt.

I've installed some software packages, will those still be present after updating my kernel?\nAnd the same question for upgrading to a new OS (14.04). Will any data or software be lost if I upgrade to 14.04?\n\nA: Upgrading shouldn't cause any data loss. However, you should always backup your data, especially before doing such things. Also, the packages you installed normally get updated when upgrading to a newer Ubuntu release, but nothing more. Some repositories might get disabled, can't say why.\nUpdating the kernel doesn't touch your files (of course, why should it do that?).\nIn fact, upgrading to a newer kernel or Ubuntu release is extremely easy and if you keep your data backed up also pretty safe.\n\nA: Updating kernel shouldn't cause any problems unless you've installed some kernel modules yourself (NVIDIA's or AMD's drivers for example). \nUpgrading Ubuntu updates your kernel and PPAs, so you might lose some applications, if your PPAs aren't compatible with 14.04 yet. Before upgrading, make sure you aren't using drivers downloaded from self added PPAs (such as Oibaf's one) or NVIDIA/AMD websites. Drivers installed from official Ubuntu repositories (eg. these in Software and updates > Additional drivers) are fine.\nYour files are safe, though doing backup before upgrading anything is a good idea.\n", "Q: Unable to build GTK+ 3 I am getting started with open source contributions and need to make-build the gnome-calculator.\nI recently downloaded gnome 3 (ubuntu) and need to build the gnome-calculator which needs gtk+3. \nI downloaded  gtk+-3.12.0.tar.xz  from this site: http://www.gtk.org/download/linux.php\n\nAfter running  ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk , I get the following problem:\nhttp://fpaste.org/101402/\n\nHowever, package atk could not be located.\n\nEDIT\nInstalling it from the repositories gives an older version that is not compatible with gnome-calculator ...

Should be as easy as \nsudo apt-get build-dep gnome-calculator \n\nand then (having the sources repository activated) \napt-get source gnome-calculator \n\nAnd then try to compile it (to start from a known point) and start hacking. \nReference here: How do I get and modify the source code of packages installed through apt-get? \n", "Q: Are there dedicated folders for user made sources and libraries/modules? This is a very basic question, yet I can't find anything relevant. Is there a standard directory where to put the sources of your projects and the location of the libraries/modules they use (which are made for the project and are non standard) ?\n\nA: Normally, you put the sources wherever you want. \nIf you plan to distribute your project via binary packages or repository, you should think in integrating it with the normal filesystem structure (i.e. binaries in /usr/bin, libraries in /usr/lib, data files in /usr/share...).\nIf the users are supposed to compile themselves the program, it (was?) an honored Unix tradition to install the project under /usr/local (/usr/local/bin,  /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/share)...\nThere are some \"standards' which are more or less followed: the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), or somewhere in the Freedesktop pages (e.g XDG Base Directory Specification).\n", "Q: Unable to re install mysql on Ubuntu 14.04: Dependency problems Ubuntu Unity 14.04 LTS with all lenses removed, except files. (Hate the dash.)\nI have a LAMP system for web site development. I want to put all my data files in a particular partition that I can easily copy back and forth between my desktop and notebook machines.  On the notebook (also running 14.04 LTS unity -64) I performed these steps, which worked perfectly:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop\nsudo cp -R -p /var/lib/mysql /ddr/mysql\ngedit /etc/mysql/my.cnf  <<changed datadir from /var/lib/mysql to /ddr/mysql>>\nsudo gedit /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld <<changed all lines /var/lib/mysql as above>>\nsudo /etc/init.d/apparmor reload\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n\nWhen I attempted the very same thing on the desktop everything fell apart.

The way I solved it is to purge the MySQL packages in APT, then install anew.\nsudo apt-get purge mysql-server-5.5 mysql-common\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nPackages like mysql-common and mysql-client get installed as dependencies.\nThe purge seems to work in my case, as I was testing several install configurations (threaded, pre-fork, etc), and some configuration files were just stale, lingering around. The purge cleans up everything and resets the configuration.\nNote that I found the list of packages to purge using dpkg -l | grep mysql, where rc and ii packages probably have to get purged (it worked for my case).\n", "Q: ATI Graphics Driver in Ubuntu 14.04 I am using a Lenovo Ideapad laptop with graphics card configuration as Radeon HD 8570A/8570M on Ubuntu 14.04.

If I manually start Software Updater everything works fine, but if there are updates and the window (should) pops up, I can't access the window.  I can see the little triangle next to the icon in the launcher saying there's a window, but the window is nowhere to be seen.  If I right click to close it and then launch it then everything is fine.\nHow do I find this hidden window or figure out what the problem might be?\n\nA: Having the same problem, I found I can click on the icon in the tray once and not see anything happen, but click on it one more time and the window appears as it normally would, just like clicking the icon once to minimize the window and clicking again to re-display that window; annoying but slightly faster than restarting Update Manager from the menu.\nThis has been reported as a bug on Launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/1325814?comments=all\n\nA: It was a workspace-related issue for me.\nI have 3 monitors arranged such that they don't add up to a rectangular X-screen. \nWhen I press Super+S to get the workspace switcher, I can see the \"invisible dead space\" in a corner.

Check to see if you have multiple workspaces enabled in Unity by checking the Appearance program:\nAppearance > Behaviour > Enable Workspaces\nIf so, disable it and the Software Updater should pop back up in your single workspace.\n\nA: I had the same problem -- there's a little triangle next to the Software Updater in the launcher in Ubuntu 14.04, but I don't see its window even after I clicked on that icon.\nThis is apparently a bug.\nOne work-around:\nI fixed it by opening up a terminal window and typing\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand hitting enter.\nAfter apt-get finishes, then hitting the Software Updater icon (or clicking the Dash Home icon, then in the search box typing \"Software Updater\" then enter to run it)\nnow opens a small \"Software Updater\" window in the middle of the screen.\n(related:\nSoftware Updater is not starting in Ubuntu 14.04\n)\n", "Q: Can't access uploaded image to generate thumbnail in PHP I had trouble fixing the file uploading, but then I ran chmod a+w /var/www and it worked - files were being uploaded to my specified directory.\nHowever, my script also generates a thumbnail immediately after the file is uploaded. This part is not working. I'm assuming that the files uploaded by the script are locked (they have a small lock appearing near them when going to the directory manually) and it can't grab the uploaded file and create a new thumbnail file based on it.\nI'm not getting any error or something.\nHow do I edit the permissions in the way that lets me create new files using \"locked\" files?\n\nA: You just need to work out your permissions correctly. If this is a web application than the user doing the file manipulation is probably www-data. So all files and directories need to be owned by the www-data group and user. And www-data should have full permissions for those files and directories.\n\n\n*\n\n*Give www-data ownership of all files and dirs in DocumentRoot: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www.\n\n*Change permission so www-data has rwx priveleges: sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www.\n\n*Add yourself to the www-data group  so you can make changes as well: sudo adduser <username> www-data. Logout and back in.\n\n*Read up on unix privileges and maybe tweak the permission within /var/www to be a bit tighter.\n", "Q: Is it possible to pause/abort mdadm reshape?

Some people loose their data even without trying to install a new OS.\nAs far as an 'idiot's\" guide, there's the installation procedure which is simply to burn the iso and boot to it.

Ubuntu is easy because it just is.\nThe OS has a Launch bar with a Firefox Icon of which clicking it, and Firefox works no different than the way it works in Windows.\nBy the way, if you were able to find someone who had never used a computer and gave them two systems to use, Ubuntu would most likely be the easiest to use.\nSome of my friends who are not familiar with Linux by knows the Mac, thank they are looking at a Mac computer when they see my environment.\nAs far as guide, click on the launch button (the button on top of the Launch bar) and type \"help\".

The function is just a bit \"lazy\" and puts a space after every IP address, even if it's only one.\nYou could remove the space at the end, but if your host has more than one IP address this script will still fail.\nIt's better to use this instead (as explained here):\n/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'\n\nYou should replace eth0 by the interface you want the IP address of.\nSo your script becomes (I also made it a bit shorter as you can see):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIP=`/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'`\n\nvlc \"http://${IP}:8888/\"\n\n", "Q: vim in 14.04 (Trusty) starts up in Replace mode I just deployed a handful of 14.04 systems and I'm noticing that whenever I vim something, vim is already in replace mode.\nAs I'm used to being in command mode on starting, this is rather disorienting.\nAny idea why?

As with most all commands/programs, you can use ln --help or man ln to get more information, but the main thing to know is that there are two types of links, hard links and symbolic (soft) links.\nSymbolic links, using the -s switch, are like windows shortcuts.  You create a shortcut to the actual file, and if you delete the file, the link becomes invalid. \nHard links, the default, create a new entry for the file.  The main thing to know here is that although they both use the same actual data, each one is somewhat independent.  If you delete one, the other is still valid.  Basically, the file has a link count, and the actual data does not get deleted until all the links are deleted.\n", "Q: Slow boot Ubuntu 14.04 A few months ago I changed on my Lenovo Q180 HTPC from Windows to Ubuntu (only Ubuntu installation, without dual boot). \nNow, after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 I am noticing a slowdown on boot.\nTherefore, I followed the instructions to check listing of dmesg.\ndmesg file\nI'm not an expert, but I noticed 3 longer gaps in dmesg extract.\nThe first gap occurs after 4.22 seconds:  \n[    4.220866] random: nonblocking pool is initialized  \n[   15.022778] Adding 4188156k swap on /dev/sda5.

I always have to chmod for newly add file/folder!  \n\nA: What you want is called ACL - Access Control Lists.\n\nAccess Control List (ACL) provides an additional, more flexible\npermission mechanism for file systems. It is designed to assist with\nUNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions for any user\nor group to any disc resource.\n\nacl package should be already installed, to check it run: dpkg -s acl.\nTo use ACL's you should enable it for your filesystem. But it can be already enabled. To check it use tune2fs -l. Substitute /dev/sda6 for your system:\n$ tune2fs -l /dev/sda6 | grep \"Default mount options:\"\nDefault mount options:    user_xattr acl\n\nIf you see acl word - it is already enabled for device /dev/sda6.\nIf you don't see acl word - run tune2fs -o acl /dev/sda6 to enable it.\n\n\nTo modify ACL use setfacl command. To add permissions use setfacl -m.\n\nTo set permission for user:\n$ setfacl -m \"u:username:rwx\" /path/to/folder\n\nThis will set rwx ACL, for user username to /path/to/folder. This means that all files created in this folder will have rwx permission for username.\n\nTo set permission for group:\n$ setfacl -m \"g:groupname:rwx\" /path/to/folder\n\nThis will set rwx ACL, for group groupname to /path/to/folder. This means that all files created in this folder will have rwx permission for group groupname.\n\nTo set permission for other:\n$ setfacl -m \"o:rwx\" /path/to/folder\n\nThis will set rwx ACL, for other to /path/to/folder. This means that all files created in this folder will have rwx permission for other.\n\nTo check permission:\n$ getfacl /path/to/folder\n\n\nTo combine acl\n$ setfacl -m u:username:rwx,g:groupname:rwx,o:rwx /path/to/folder\n\n\nDefault ACL\n The new object inherits the default ACL of the containing directory as its\n access ACL.\n\n If no default ACL is associated with a directory, the mode parameter to the func‐\n tions creating file objects and the file creation mask (see umask(2)) are used to\n determine the ACL of the new object:\n\n The new object is assigned an access ACL containing entries of tag types\n ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER. The permissions of these entries\n are set to the permissions specified by the file creation mask.\n\nSo if you set default ACL, it would be preferred ACL. That means if set ACL for user or group, new created file would inherit default acl anyway. Be carefully with default ACL.\nTo set default acl use -d key,\n$ setfacl -d -m u::rwx,g::rwx,o::rwx /path/to/folder\n\nor use default word\n$ setfacl -m default:u::rwx,default:g::rwx,default:o::rwx /path/to/folder\n\nBe carefully with setting default ACL. For example if set like this:\n$ setfacl -d -m o:--x /path/to/folder\n\nand now fetch this ACL\n$ getfacl /path/to/folder\n# file: path/to/folder\n# owner: c0rp\n# group: c0rp\nuser::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::--x\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:group::rwx\ndefault:other::--x\n\ndefault ACL for group and user will be rwx automatically!\nRemove ACL\n$ setfacl -b /path/to/folder\n\nThis will remove all ACL's from folder\n\nFinally\nIf you are only user in system, I recommend use default ACL.\n$ setfacl -d -m u::rwx,g::rwx,o::rwx /path/to/folder\n\nThis will do what you want for /path/to/folder\nSources\narchlinux - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Access_Control_Lists\nhelp.ubuntu - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissionsACLs\n", "Q: Ubuntu all of a sudden fails to boot on ThinkPad T430 Not booting\nRunning Ubuntu on my T430 has been fairly straightforward and great until just now. After I used my Windows for some days, Ubuntu all of a sudden fails to boot.

Unfortunately, I don't know what to do with it.\n\nWhat now?\nI have no idea where a problem like this could come from. In Windows, Lenovo showed a UEFI-Update wich I thought I had deselected, but it might just have slipped in. Anyway, can a problem like this be triggered by a updated UEFI? \nStarting in recovery mode doesn't help. I cleaned old kernels to have space on my /boot - partition again so I cannot try older kernels. Until now, the current kernel just worked for me.\nAs I don't have a OS I can work with in the moment I would be very grateful for any tips, hints or suggestions.\n\nA: The problem with the USB was obviously a broken ISO. My bad, I should have checked better. So the live system is working now.\nWith the live system, I got new information and the issue seems to be more about my /boot-partition than my UEFI.

Your screen0 and screen1 will also have to be configured.  You can do so by running sudo X -configure when there is no X session (recovery mode can do this) and then save the xorg.conf.new file.

There seems to be a simple workaround to restore the highquality A2DP interworking to your Bluetooth headset.\n1) Use Blueman to pair to the headset.

The quality will still be poor...\n6) Now use Blueman GUI, select the device and press mouse right click and then select the \"Refresh Services\".\n     It should show a succes message in the lower status bar.\n7) Right click on the headset device in Blueman GUI and select Audio Sink. If it displays a success message your in luck.\n8) Now right click the headset device in Blueman GUI and select Audio Profile menu and then select \"High Fidelity Playback (A2DP)\". It should suceed and switch into the correct mode.\n==> You will always have to issue the \"pulseaudio -k\" command from terminal before using the headset, but it's a tolerable\n        work around.\nHope this works for you too.\n\nA: Install bluetooth common drivers for ubuntu.\nThen try to connect through Bluez.\n sudo apt-get install bluez bluez-alsa bluez-audio bluez-btsco bluez-compat bluez-cups bluez-dbg bluez-gstreamer bluez-hcidump bluez-pcmcia-support bluez-tools bluez-utils python-bluez bluewho indicator-bluetooth libbluetooth-dev  libgnome-bluetooth11 libbluetooth3 python-gobject python-dbus\n\n", "Q: Changing Ubuntu and Windows 8 queue at dual-boot I recently installed ubuntu alongside windows 8.1 and i'm new to ubuntu.

So, if i don't select any of them it should boot automatically to windows instead of ubuntu because i use ubuntu less than windows.\n\nA: You need to edit file /etc/default/grub. To do so, open Gnome Terminal window and type:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nIn the opened file, find line that looks like:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nand change 0 to index of desired position in the list in GRUB menu displayed on boot. Note, that the menu list is counted from 0, not from 1. So if your Windows is, let's say on the 4th position, you must change 0 to 3:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=3\nAfter saving the file, you must update GRUB by running command:\nsudo update-grub\nNote, that instead of indexes, you can use operating system name, which can be found in the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

After installing Variety. I'm using gnome 3.10 on ubuntu 14.04, with gdm as my default login manager. Also, numix-gtk-theme and numix circle icon pack.\nFor whatever reason, sometimes my system stops detecting wifi (even if it's already connected) and I can only reconnect upon rebooting. After one of those reboots, I logged in, but was presented with the grayish gdm background, without no further actions. All I could do (and I've done this extensively since then) was Ctrl + Alt + F1 and try some stuff out.\nAfter some research, I noticed that: \n\n\n*\n\n*startx worked at that particular session, but it was rather slow;\n\n*reinstalling, reconfiguring, both gdm and gnome-shell would do nothing;\n\n*the only thing that seemed to fix my problem was renaming /.config/dconf; after rebooting, it worked.

If you need further info, let me know and I'll edit accordingly.\n\nA: It seems I've solved the problem. After a lot of tinkering and resetting my dconf several times, I started to look closely and noticed several things.\nAlthough I don't have the logs (.bash_history doesn't save output, only input), what I know is that I used to receive something along\nperl: couldn't find your locale.

I searched about it and reconfigured my locale several times - it didn't worked. Then, I realized I didn't even have my language pack installed.\nAfter reinstalling it, everything worked (even with changing at start enabled).\nYes, I know: it's really unrelated (it was my fault after all), but if it causes a complete failure for gnome, I think it should get an workaround.\n", "Q: Desktop environment delivery via remote virtual server I've known since shortly after starting with various flavors of *nix circa '04 that the OS is a multi-user server environment. There remains a nagging issue that I just can't seem wrap my head around, and I'd like to solve it. Given that on effectively any virtual infrastructure (whether I own it or not) I can spin up this multi-user environment with relative ease and connect to it securely (as I can), and given that I can install and securely deliver applications at no additional cost per application via ssh command line, why is complete, open delivery of a desktop environment such a pain?\nVDI solutions exist, but are nearly all geared towards Windows; this makes sense given that the Windows environment wasn't designed with multiple users in mind.

However, if I make a mistake and mistype the beginning of the directory and \"tab it out\", I end up having to use backspace and re-type it in. Is there a shortcut key to undo the auto-completion in the terminal?\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION\nTo expand on what I've said in a comment, I was wondering if there was a shortcut to undo to the last directory. So, currently ctrl+shift+- seems to work well except it un-does individual letters.\nFor example, if I have the following directory setup:\nDocuments\n\n --> d1something\n\n --> d2something\n\nAnd I want to go to \"d2something\" but accidentally type \"cd d1\", it will autofill to:\ncd Documents/d1something/\n\nThen, by using ctrl+shift+- it will then be:\ncd Documents/d1something\n\nAgain:\ncd Documents/d1\n\nAgain:\ncd Documents\n\nWhat I was wondering if there's a shortcut to get from cd Documents/d1something/ back to cd Documents (first and last step). If not, the ctrl+shift+- will work fine.\n\nA: According to the bash man page, the default shortcut for the undo function is either Ctrl+_ (note that this is Ctrl+Shift+- on most keyboards) or Ctrl+x followed by Ctrl+u. If your tab completion added a trailing slash to the directory name, you may have to undo twice, once to remove the slash and once more to remove the text that the completion added.\nIf instead what you want is to remove the last complete directory component from a path you are entering in bash, the closest way to achieve this is with the backward-kill-word function. By default this is bound to the Alt+Backspace key combination. This will erase the last \"word\" from your command line, where a word consists entirely of alphanumeric characters.\nThis seems to work with your given example directory names. Note that if the last directory name contains spaces or punctuation characters like - or _, these are treated as word delimiters, so you may have to repeat this key combination more than once to erase back to the last / character.\n\nA: Use Zsh, with oh-my-zsh (optional)\npress control and c or if you want maybe a better way, press control + shift + underscore key. Sorry I don't use bash, zsh is superior anyway, give it a try\n", "Q: TP-Link TL-WN321G Driver Lubuntu 14.04 Install i downloaded the drivers from the main site but i did not understand correctly how to install on Lubuntu 14.04.\nWhat's the correct way?\nhttp://www.tp-link.it/resources/software/200912314051713.zip here are the drivers\nThanks!\n\nA: I suspect that your wireless has the driver it needs, rt73usb. A wireless interface wlan0 is present. However, you are unable to select an available network because of a bug in lubuntu.\nTo fix the Network Manager not showing up on the panel issue, from the Lubuntu menu select Preferences > Default applications for LXSession, then click on the Autostart tab and under \"Manual autostarted applications\" type \"nm-applet\", then click the \"+ Add\" button on the left.\nNow log out, log back in and you should see the Network Manager icon on the panel: http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/fix-lubuntu-1404-network-manager.html\nOnce the Network Manager icon appears, select 'Enable Networking' and 'Enable Wireless.'\n\nA: Are you sure Ubuntu hasn't installed the driver automatically? Enter ipconfig -a in a terminal and check if there's a wlan0. If there is, it's probably already installed.\nThere may also be a driver available in Additional Drivers (search for it in your Dash). This is the easiest way to get it working.\nI also found this but it's for Ubuntu 10.04 so you may have to do things a bit different (for example I wouldn't install that linux-firmware package as it's probably outdated).\nIf you really want to install this yourself you can follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First install the necessary stuff:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential unzip\n\n\n*Extract the .zip file:\nunzip 200912314051713-1.zip\n\n\n*Enter the Module directory:\ncd \"Driver for TL-WN321G in Linux/Module\"\n\n\n*Configure the driver:\n./Configure\n\n\n*Compile the driver:\nmake\n\n\n*Check if it compiled correctly:\nmake test\n\n\n*Install the driver:\nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: Automatically run xbmc at bootup in lubuntu Running a fresh install of lubuntu 14.04, would like to have xbmc run at boot but I cant seem to find any system setting like that.

More specifically, I want to have the user folder for my home account another disk that has more space, but keep my other smaller accounts on my ssd. I was able to copy my user folder to another disk, but now I need to link it to the home folder on my ssd, I want it accessible from a normal boot, and please don't tell me that what I did was not the best thing, I just want an answer.  How do I get it to create a link that goes from /home/username to /extra-home/username and is recognised by the system when loading the user folders? \n\nA: I would try this:\nWhile logged in as a different user, in a root shell (e.g. sudo -i), copy over the contents of /home/username to /extra-home/username and make sure the new location is owned by username:\n# cp -p /home/username /extra-home/\n# chown username:username /extra-home/username\n\nMove the original /home/username/ directory to a safe place:\n# mv /home/username /root/\n\nCreate the symlink:\n# ln -s /extra-home/username /home/username\n\nVerify it's working as expected by opening another terminal window and running su:\n$ sudo su username\n\nIf everything looks good, at least from the terminal (contents of /home/username/ appear as expected), then log out and log back in (I'm assuming you're on Ubuntu desktop) and it should be working normally. However, if it isn't, just delete the symlink and move the archived home folder back to its original location.\n\nA: Remember that your permissions will need to be the same.  In addition to symlink, on more recent distros and filesystems, as root you can also use bind-mount:  \nmkdir /home/username \nmount --bind --verbose /extra-home/username /home/username\n\nThis is useful for allowing access \"through\" the /home directory to subdirs via daemons that are otherwise configured to avoid pathing through symlinks (apache, ftpd, etc.).  \nYou have to remember (or init script) to bind upon restarts, of course.\n\nA: According to this question on Super User this is possible.\nYou can create a symbolic link using:\nln -s /extra-home/username /home/username\n\nIf it doesn't work for some reason you can just delete the symbolic link, move the directory back and reboot your computer.\n", "Q: Bricked my computer, is there any way to get it back?

I saw the guide on Lifehacker and figured I'd give it a try.\nMy system is an i3 3225 on an Intel DH77DF mobo with 8GB of ram.  There's a 64GB mSATA SSD as the boot drive and two 4TB WD Red drives for the RAID1 configuration.\nI installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in UEFI mode on the SSD without issues but as soon as I create the software RAID1 (and it finishes syncing after 9 hours), gparted gives me the following errors:\nLibparted Bug Found!\nEnd of file while reading Invalid argument \nThe primary GPT table is corrupt, but the backup appears OK, so that will be used.\nThese appear twice as almost for each 4TB drive.\nAm I doing something wrong when creating the RAID?

For example, mdadm wasn't initially installed so I had to figure that out.  This was also after the fact I found out BIOS RAID is really FakeRAID.\n\nA: Apparently you have some leftover broken partition tables on the drives.  This causes the version of libparted in Ubuntu to refuse to operate on it.  Wipe it out so you can start fresh with dd:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero count=64 of=/dev/md127\n\nAlternatively you should be able to use the disk utility to create a new partition table on the raid array.  After either of these, you should be able to use gparted.\n\nA: With the help of a friend I figured it out!!\nAfter doing more research because I wasn't entirely satisfied with having to create two raids on one set of drives (no offence), I managed to set it up how I want it. Moving over to the terminal rather than the GUI helped a lot and the big issue was left over GPT table data from my previous raid attempts.  Once I figured out how to clear that data and create the raid from scratch, I had no other issues.\nTo check for left over data:\nsudo mdadm -D /dev/sda\nretuns \"..does not appear to be an md device.\"\n(same for /sdb)\nBut when I go to create the raid:\nsudo mdadm –create /dev/md1 –level=1 –raid-devices=2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb\nreturns \"../Dev/sda appears to be part of a raid array...\"\nSo to clear the old GPT data I had to go to each drive and:\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\n2   (for GPT)\nx   (for expert commands)\nz   (wipe the gpt data)\nYes\nYes\n(credit goes to @Steve HHH for his answer here)\nFrom there I created the raid1 in the terminal rather than the GUI using the same code above:\nsudo mdadm –create /dev/md1 –level=1 –raid-devices=2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb\nAfter that finished syncing I used the GUI based GParted to create the separate partitions and no more errors are appearing.

Unfortunately, some ISPs realised that they could instead resolve unknown addresses to point to their own internal servers, and then serve their customers targeted advertising based on the site that they tried to connect to. This appears to be what is happening in your case. Your ISP is intercepting your unresolved address, and redirecting it to one of its own servers.

This worked well after I installed Refind's ext4 driver. \nI also have the hard-drive from my previous laptop on a USB external drive with copies of Windows and Ubuntu on separate partitions which I'd like to boot on the Mac. I can mount these partitions on OSX or Ubuntu, but as Refind didn't recognise the installations I used Gdisk to change the disk to GPT. \nAfter that, Refind recognised the existence of the external Ubuntu and Windows installations, but doesn't give any information about the kernel and shows a penguin icon for Ubuntu. Trying to boot this leads to a pause then a blank screen with the message: \n\nNo bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key\n\nI added a stanza in refind.conf referring to Ubuntu by UUID, and I added a refind_linux.conf to the Boot folder in the Ubuntu 13.04 x64 partition on the external drive, but this made no difference:\n\"Boot x64 13.04 with standard options\"        \"ro root=31b998f7-0607-40f3-ba7f-67f297d79a2d quiet splash\"\nCan anyone suggest where I've gone wrong, or how to get it working?\nThanks.\n\nA: The \"no bootable device\" error probably indicates that rEFInd was detecting a BIOS-mode boot loader, but that the Mac's firmware was unable to launch it. This can happen with external disks on Macs, and there's not much that rEFInd can do about it -- booting external disks, especially in BIOS mode, is just flaky on some models. There are other ways to get Linux booted, though....\nTry hitting the Esc key. Sometimes an EFI is sluggish about registering some filesystems, so they don't appear when rEFInd first starts up, but hitting Esc causes a re-scan and they'll appear. If this works, you can try adding scan_delay 1 to the refind.conf file. This will slow down rEFInd's bringing up its menu, but the options should all appear.\nIf that fails, then check the filesystem types. You say you've got the ext4fs driver installed, so that should enable rEFInd to scan ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems; but if you used something else on the external disk, you'll need to install a suitable filesystem driver (if one exists).\nA last-ditch fix is to create a /boot partition for your external-drive installation, but on your internal drive. This can help if the firmware in your Mac is particularly recalcitrant about booting from an external drive, even in EFI mode. A /boot partition can be quite small, so this won't chew up a lot of disk space.\nYour Windows installation will be harder to get booted. It will work better with an MBR disk, but you seem to be running into BIOS-mode boot problems with that. There's a very long thread on MacRumors about booting Windows natively in EFI mode on Macs. This is possible for some models, and is easier with Windows 8 than with Windows 7. With Windows 7, it's very difficult to get working.\n", "Q: Bluetooth and speaker occasionally working on ASUS N550JV I use a ASUS N550JV laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8 dual boot. The Bluetooth module is atheros ar3012. Since the day Ubuntu is installed, the behavior of Bluetooth and speaker is weird. They are not totally dead.

However, when I double click the file it opens in gedit.

It executes when you log into linux.  If you can write an autoexec.bat file (msdos), you can write a bashrc.  Anything you do with a msdos batch file can very easily be done with a linux script file.  However the reverse isn't valid.\nJust because you can write very complex script files in Linux, doesn't mean you have to.\n2 -  I don't know what you mean about a green file.  You don't need a dot to execute a file.  You can use a dot to load a new environment into the current session.  That might be kind of complex and something a novice might not have to do unless he has a specific reason for doing it.  Very few people in Windows work in a terminal screen.  Most of them do just about everything with a mouse gui click.   The same goes for Ubuntu also.\nHowever, Linux has a plus in that just about anything you do in a gui can very easily be done at a command prompt.  This makes giving support to a novice very easy.  Instead of going through a lot of complex dialog telling a user what to click on and trying to guest how the next gui screen is going to appear, many users give a simple command line that can be copied and pasted and perform the function in one shot.\n3 - Ubuntu has a navigation bar located on your right side.  Very near the top is something that looks like a file cabinet.  It's a file browser.  Plugging in your USB or CD Roms and such will appear in that file browser, with very easy access.\nEven if you don't have the file browser on the screen, plugging in a new drive will most likely bring up the browser with the files.\nIt's not clear what you're trying to do, but I believe you'll be surprised at how easy the Ubuntu environment happens to be.\nAre you saying you plugged in a USB drive and didn't get a popup showing you the content?\n\nA: 1.) The bash man page is the authoritative reference:\n\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.\nWhen bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:\nif [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi  \n\nbut the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the file name.\n\nThe file is just shell commands. It is typically used to change prompts, set environment variables, and define shell procedures. Traditionally, the file .profile is used for this purpose, but bash has so many extensions that it needs its own startup file for users that want to put bashisms in startup files.\n\"Not a login shell\" means things like script launches and usually terminal windows started by window managers. Sometimes I set up *nix systems to have .bashrc and BASH_ENV just source .profile. As long as you don't stray outside of POSIX shell commands then you will get the same initialization in any shell.\nIt's particularly valuable when sh is really bash, which sometimes happens. To do this use:\n. .profile\n\nOne reason this is all so complex is because sometimes people put things that produce output into shell startup files, or they unconditionally set prompts. This causes lots of problems when running shell programs and backtick commands within languages, not to mention system(3) from C programs. The way bash starts up is designed, I think, to have one file where output and prompt setting is OK and one file where it isn't. Traditionally, a run-time test would be done to distinguish interactivity, for example, checking to see if the prompt is set.\nsource: https://superuser.com/questions/49289/what-is-the-bashrc-file\n\nA: normally we suggest one question at a time..\n.bashrc is a configuration file for your shell, bash. \nhttp://linuxcommand.org/\nDot in front can mean a few things, post an examlpe.\n\n\n*\n\n*could specify current directory for programs not in your $PATH\n\n*Could be source . file\n\n\nLinux is different, not harder.

To have webbrowser support, you need libgluezilla installed'. Then, I run this command 'sudo apt-get install libgluezilla' and Package libgluezilla is not available.\nSecond question : How can I make a .desktop file instead of creating widgets?\nIn Linux Mint 16 KDE when I right click program in Application Launcher > Add to desktop, it automatically creates a .desktop file, but in Kubuntu 14.04, it creates a widget.\n\nA: Run apt-cache search libgluezilla to find the correct package.\nYou should see something like:\nlibmono-webbrowser4.0-cil - Mono Web Browser library (for CLI 4.0)\nInstall the package listed.\nFor the second part, see Are there any GUI apps that can create .desktop files?\n\nA: I use alacarte which is absolutely sufficient for my purposes. You can get it by just running the following command in your terminal:\napt install alacarte\n\nWith this nice tool you can easily manage menu and desktop shortcuts. It has a graphical interface and is really easy to use. For example, you can customize the commands according to your needs by adding arguments, or use your own icons, and so on. You can also customize the existing shortcuts. At the end it will generate the desired .desktop file for you. So you can easily launch applications or command line programs via an icon. \nFor more information take a look here. \nBtw: The alacarte package is also aviable in other Distros, too. Just in case, here you can download the package manually.\n", "Q: Why do I see a CRON session opening and closing every hour in /var/log/auth.log? I am quite fresh with Linux as a whole, so this may be a silly question - but\nI would still like to know the answer \nThis morning when I look at my /var/log/auth.log (which I've been told to make a habit)\nI notice that once an hour  it has logged an event that looks like this:\n     May 13 20:17:01 Ubuntu-Server-1401-VM CRON[2280]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)\n     May 13 20:17:01 Ubuntu-Server-1401-VM CRON[2280]: session closed for user root\n\nIt has then proceeded to happen every hour at x:17:01 until I opened the log.\nAn SSH connection to this server has been kept alive during this time (where the log entires occured). My best guess is that every hour my SSH client has looked to see whether or not it could obtain root access as a way to verify the connection to the SSH connection to the server - but I would like to be on the safe side. Does anyone know what this is?\n\nA: Assuming you have not changed anything from the default cron setup, this is your /etc/crontab running. On my Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS server, its contents include:\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n\nSo, cron wakes up every hour and runs any scrips located in /etc/cron.hourly. You probably don't have any which is why it doesn't do anything. It simply runs a root session which executes run-parts and then closes the session again.\n\nA: These log entries were written by the PAM libraries when the crond daemon ran tasks in the background. crond runs jobs on a schedule, on behalf of the system and the users on the system.\nEvery user has their own crontab configuration file, which can be edited with the crontab -e command or shown using crontab -l. The system administrator can also configure jobs via a plethora of /etc/ files and directories; /etc/cron.d/ provides an easy place for services to drop their own configurations, and /etc/crontab drives the hourly, daily, and weekly directories, as well as runs whatever the administrator may choose to run.\ncrond will change users to the correct user (either specified in the /etc/crontab file and the /etc/cron.d/ directory, or from the user-supplied crontab files) before running the jobs; it uses the PAM system to change users.\nPAM provides a single place to configure different ways to authenticate and authorize users and provide session setup, as well as provide a way to change passwords (or other authentication tokens). Every service that uses PAM has a configuration file in /etc/pam.d/ that describes which PAM modules to use when 'logging in' a user.\nMy /etc/pam.d/cron file looks like this:\n# The PAM configuration file for the cron daemon\n\n@include common-auth\n\n# Read environment variables from pam_env's default files, /etc/environment\n# and /etc/security/pam_env.conf.\nsession       required   pam_env.so\n\n# In addition, read system locale information\nsession       required   pam_env.so envfile=/etc/default/locale\n\n@include common-account\n@include common-session-noninteractive \n\n# Sets up user limits, please define limits for cron tasks\n# through /etc/security/limits.conf\nsession    required   pam_limits.so\n\nThis ensures limits that are configured for users are applied to users' tasks when they run them via cron. If you wanted to change those limits per-service, you could configure pam_limits.so in this file with your own conf=/etc/security/cron-limits.conf and apply different limits than ssh logins (/etc/pam.d/sshd) or console logins (/etc/pam.d/login).\n", "Q: ptrace-scope is unaccessible When installing Ubuntu 14.04 the following message came up when some component install seemed to go awry:\nif install fails set /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace-scope to 0\n\nI have tried editing the file in question by means of:\nsudo gedit /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace-scope\n\nThen copy the file to /home/myname/Documents, edit it, which works fine there.

I've got the driver, it's the same one I used in the previous version of Ubuntu, it just isn't working any more, :-(\n\nA: Found an answer on this site and got my card working.

I've tried doing an \"updatedb\" and doing a search for the words \"Will now halt\" but nothing comes up.\nThe \"fail\" in the image below appears to be coming from \"Killing all remaining processes\".\n\n\nA: This issue was resolved after I got the correct drivers installed for my Broadcom wireless card.

Most likely not. The upstart scripts are not a sequence of commands like bash scripts (or .bat / .cmd files in Windows). They are configuration files (like .ini files in Windows) and one of the configuration options happens to point to an actual executable.\n...does this explain the fact that theres no logfile being created? Since forever has never been started it didn't have a chance to leave a log file behind. I am reasonably sure you could find something in the upstart log files though.\n\nA: I know I'm a bit late to this, but rather than using exec and the start-stop-daemon process, use forever's built in daemon, foreverd.\nforeverd start --spinSleepTime 10000 /home/nodeapps/node_app.js\nforeverd start --spinSleepTime 10000 /home/nodeapps/node_metrix.js\n\nIf the root env does not have a path to forever (though it probably does, because you installed it through sudo npm install -g forever) you need to specify the path to foreverd rather than running foreverd.

This means that you should create user resolve, and run installation as this user.\n$ sudo useradd -d /home/resolve -s /bin/bash -m resolve\n\nNow move you install file to /home/resolve, and give permissions for resolve:resolve\n$ chown resolve:resolve yourfile\n\nSwitch in terminal to this user: sudo su resolve, and run installation as you do it before.\nI don't know what is Davinci Resolve and how use it, may be you do not need HOME directory for you user, and you only need user. In that case run \n$ sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -M resolve\n\nThis will not create home folder\n\nA: The software is designed to run only on a custom Linux built for it, so there is no way to install it on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I hook up my iPod with iTunes? I have a Apple Ipod 30GB. I need to run it on Lubuntu 14.04 with full functionallity. Can I run iTunes on Lubuntu 14.04. If so, how?\n\nA: Well, The only way to use iTunes in Ubutnu is using Wine, but you will be alone if you try to use the USB capabilities since those patches are not included in the source and is highly likely that it would work either way. So, the most logical solution, look for a native media player that supports your iPod or use a virtual machine and install Windows + iTunes.\n", "Q: HP Compaq TC4200 problems I have a hp compaq tc4200 and the headphone jack doesn't work it acts like nothing's plugged in.

I want to setup the monitor layout accordingly, but when I do that, some of the desktop icons are not appearing...\nIt looks like the icons are put on the  top left of the X screen, regardless of the layout of the monitors... How can this be solved? \nsee this image:\n\nwhere the black-yellow blocks are the icons, so the  first two are off screen and the third partially... even re-organizing the desktop icons will not solve it...\n\nA: Even though this is a bit old I'd like to answer this for other people who found this thread when trying to fix this issue, like me. \nI found the fix is extremely simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file manager and navigate to the desktop folder located in your Home folder. (The file manager will show all your desktop icons there)\n\n*Now simply drag and drop the icons you need moved from the file manager to the place you want on your desktop. \n\n\nInstead of duplicating the icons, it will simply relocate the existing ones to where you want.\n\nA: My solution was to create empty folders to fill the hidden space.  Resize the icon to be the max size (or as big as needed), give it a transparent icon, and name it with only spaces.  Then drag them into position.  To more accurately place them, create a visible row of folders below the invisible ones, select them all to move them, and delete the visible ones.\nObviously, not ideal, but all I could figure out.  Don't understand why icons can't appear on the primary monitor first...\n\nA: Simple:  move the left hand monitor (in software) to the top of the screen.  That will force the icons back down onto it.\n\nA: Try using another display manager. Maybe ARandR could do the trick. sudo apt-get install arandr. Afterwards open it typing nohup arandr in the command line.\n\nA: Go to the file manager of your system and and navigate to the Desktop folder, then drag-n'-drop the icons from there onto your actual desktop.\n\nA: One significant fix could be to turn off the \"Keep Aligned\" option in the context menu on the desktop. Right click on desktop to bring up the context menu. And turn off keep aligned. Whatever you place on the desktop will then keep in its position. Auto alignment seems to be doing some funny stuff.\n\nA: Occasionally I have the same problem.

If they are OK, then \n2.)does anyone know how to set or reset the DTR line? This is used to enable or suppress the output from the multimeter.\ncurrently using tcl/tk for accessing hardware.\n\nA: To answer my own questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*the usb-serial drivers for PL2303 do work and are not broken. I think most of the problems arise from the initialization where the DTR line defaults to -ve volts ie 0. Previous versions of Ubuntu (i.e. 10.04) the default was +ve volts on the DTR line. Note that other usb to serial converters such as Belkin F5U409 in UBUNTU 14.04 default to +ve volts on DTR line thus work OK. Confirmation of working drivers was done using GTKterm and toggling the DTR line. Furthermore connection to a Stanford Research SR830 Lock-in amplifier was established and its identify verified.\n\n*Having established working drivers, the solution in tcl/tk is to use the -ttycontrol switch within the fconfigure command. i.e.:\n...\n\nset device \"/dev/ttyUSB0\"\n\nset dh [open $device r+]\n\nfconfigure $dh -mode $baud_rate,$parity,$data_bits,$stop_bits -translation binary -encoding binary -blocking 0 -buffering line -ttycontrol {RTS 0 DTR 1}\n\nset tmpstr [ read $dh ]\n\nclose $dh \n\n...\n\nWorks for me :).\n", "Q: ssh authorized_keys : Configuring single public key for multipl hosts How to use single public key for multiple hosts do i need to duplicate the entries in authorized_keys? or is there a way to do it as single configuration?\nFor example:\nKey user@host1 user@host2 user@host3\n\nA: In /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server to be accessed remotely, enter the public key (in Ubuntu, contents of /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) for the device the user will be logging in from.

I've just run into a bug. Somewhere while scrobbling round with sudo pip, I appear to have knackered my dist-packages. The suggested workaround is to [re]move /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages and start again. I've had a look in the directory and it's pretty massive. Years of abuse.\nI'm happy enough reinstalling everything with pip but I don't want to delete and then overwrite a load of packaged paths. In my experience, that's a recipe for agony.\nI know we're talking about a /usr/local/ directory here. These should be non-packaged files but I would like to make double-sure... And this might apply to other people who are in similar predicaments.\nSo is there a quick way I can list what packages a directory contains?\n\nA: dpkg -S ... can work well here. It's something I would normally use to check which package a specific file comes from but here we can use:\n$ dpkg -S /usr/local/lib/python2.7/\ndpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /usr/local/lib/python2.7\n\nThis works because packages specify their file paths in full. If one contains a file /usr/bin/file it will specify the following as its paths:\n/usr\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/file\n\n\nI looked to see if /usr/local/ had any packaged files (because it really shouldn't IMO) and found:\n$ dpkg -S /usr/local/\nhl2250dnlpr, wine, shatter, cupswrapperhl2250dn, open-sankore: /usr/local\n\nHow very curious.\n", "Q: WAN Failover using eth0 and wlan0 I need to create a failover using wifi - connected to wireless 3G modem and lan connected to adsl router\nWhen the Adsl goes down it needs to failover to the 3G on wlan0\nI've tried many scripts online and nothing works, please send me the correct script I'll need.\nPS: i need to check for hosts such as www.google.com, the failover wont be of any use if it only fails over after physically unplugging the eth cable.

But assuming that all runs well, we can schedule it to run every 5 minutes by running crontab -e and adding the following on a new line:\n*/5 * * * *    /usr/local/bin/inettest\n\nYou might want a tighter resolution. Cron can only schedule down to the minute but you can stack multiple calls with sleeps.

I can presumably make sed remove the unwanted lines, but timestamping them prior to removal must be the wrong approach. \nI would appreciate an explanation and some help.  \n\nA: To answer the question directly, sed is buffering and that's the sole problem.\nYou can fix this by telling it not to buffer with its -u/--unbuffered flag:\nsed -u '/^$/d' /dev/ttyUSB0 | ts\n\nWith a test harness (but you'll need to run it for proof):\n$ (echo -e 'banana\\n\\n'; sleep 2; echo 'cheese') | sed -u '/^$/d' | ts\nMay 14 11:26:05 banana\nMay 14 11:26:07 cheese\n\nYou can run into similar predicaments with other stream editors. They seemingly all want to buffer a little bit. They all have workarounds though. Here are a bunch of commands I've tested:\n... | mawk -W interactive '/./' | ts\n... | gawk '/./ { print $0; fflush(); }' | ts\n... | grep --line-buffered '.' | ts\n... | perl -n -e 'print if /./' | ts\n\n\nAnother idea is to just let gawk handle it. It can filter for non-empty lines and do the date-printing for you (thanks to SO's Kieron):\nawk '/./ { print strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"), $0; fflush(); }' /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nThat flushes straight after lines come in. gawk is especially helpful here if you want to do other things... If you want to check that the fourth column of output (pre-ts) matches a regex, you can (eg $4~/\\d{4}/). Awk (and its variants) are very flexible for stream processing. \nAnother test harness:\n$ gawk '/./ { print strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"), $0; fflush(); }' <(\n      echo -e 'banana\\n\\n';\n      sleep 2;\n      echo 'cheese'\n  )\n2014-05-14 11:13:59 banana\n2014-05-14 11:14:01 cheese\n\n\nA: bash can handle this in a while read loop\n(echo -e 'banana\\n\\n'; sleep 2; echo 'cheese') | \nwhile IFS= read -r line; do \n    [[ $line ]] && echo \"$(date \"+%F %T\") line\"\ndone\n\n2014-05-14 06:34:06 banana\n2014-05-14 06:34:08 cheese\n\nYou can remove lines with only whitespace with a tricky parameter expansion: remove all leading whitespace and see if the line is empty:\nshopt -s extglob\n\n(echo -e '  banana\\n\\t\\n'; sleep 2; echo 'cheese') |\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    [[ \"${line/#+([[:blank:]])/}\" ]] && echo \"$(date \"+%F %T\") $line\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: Lost audio after upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 After the upgrade I've lost the audio output immediately: no hardware change !\nWith Kubuntu 14.04 Kernel 3.13.0-24-generic (#47-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 2 23:31:42 UTC 2014) - the audio doesn't work at all.\nAll my ALSA information is located at\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=9fb68b073380ba8bb16213bef8843b2a6bf54557\nThe audio drive seems correctly loaded but it doesn't work.\n\nA: You have 2 sound devices on your pc:\nFirst one is HDMI output,\nsecond one is  the main device which has several faders muted,( Note at the end ).  \nTwo ways to unmute the second device:\n1.

Opening a\n  Bash shell and assuming that the file revkit-1.3.tar.gz is in the\n  current working directory, first the package needs to be unpacked:\ntar xvfz revkit−1.3.tar . gz\ncd revkit−1.3\n\nThen, you can build the toolkit. The build process is divided into two\n  scripts. First, the RevKit environment is created using the bootstrap\n  script. Afterwards, the RevKit algorithms are built using the build\n  script. This has the benefit of running the second script only if\n  changes have been made on the algorithms but not on the environment.\n  The bootstrap script should only be called once at the beginning. More\n  precisely, first run the bootstrap script:  \n./make.py bootstrap  \n\nThis will download and compile all dependencies automatically. For\n  that purpose, compiling boost takes some time. If you already have\n  installed boost using the distribution’s package manager, the option\n  -DBOOST PATH can be used to specify its path, e.g. -DBOOST PATH=/usr. \n  Alternatively you can specify the boost include and libs\n  path separately by using –boost, –boost-include-dir and\n  –boost-lib-dir as arguments. Please make sure that your version of\n  boost satisfies the requirements. After bootstrapping the environment,\n  the build script needs to be executed. To run this script manually\n  call:\n./make.py build  \n\nThis will build the whole RevKit suite including the core, algorithms,\n  examples, and the Python bindings. The Python bindings enable the CLI\n  to use RevKit like a shell. If the system cannot build the Python\n  bindings or if they are not needed, they can be deactivated by\n  calling:\n./make.py build −DBUILD BINDINGS=OFF\n\ninstead. Further packages which are not available in the distribution’s package\n  manager (e.g. CUDD or PUMA) are downloaded and installed automatically\n  from the bootstrap script. Boost is also required and will be\n  downloaded and installed by default. \nThe build script must be called at least once. Afterwards, the sources\n  only need to be compiled again if local changes have been performed.\n  Alternatively, the program make can be executed manually by calling:\nmake  \n\nin the build directory. The build script also provides the options of\n  enabling and disabling the compilation of unstable and example\n  algorithms by using the parameters -DBUILD UNSTABLE and -DBUILD EXAMPLES. \n\nif this is correct an gui window should open in the following instructions which am not able to see:\n4.1.

I keep getting the normal notifications of Chrome itself.\nI'm using Google Chrome 34.0.1847.137 on Ubuntu 14.04 x64.\nCan someone tell me how to get this working?\n\nA: For LibNotify, the JSON file that it installs has the incorrect extension ID. Updating the extension ID to the correct one fixes it.\nGo to .config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts (for Google Chrome) or .config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts (for Chromium). Open up the JSON file in the folder, and notice that in the allowed_origins section, it allows the extension ID gphchdpdmccpjmpiilaabhpdfogeiphf. However, the extension ID (at least in my case, but it should be the same for everyone) is actually epckjefillidgmfmclhcbaembhpdeijg.\nTo fix this, either replace the incorrect extension ID with the correct one, or add a comma and the correct extension ID after it. I personally chose the latter option, and here's what my JSON file looks like:\n{\n  \"name\": \"com.initiated.chrome_libnotify_notifications\",\n  \"description\": \"Libnotify Notifications in Chrome\",\n  \"path\": path to the location of install.sh,\n  \"type\": \"stdio\",\n  \"allowed_origins\": [\n    \"chrome-extension://gphchdpdmccpjmpiilaabhpdfogeiphf/\",\n    \"chrome-extension://epckjefillidgmfmclhcbaembhpdeijg/\"\n  ]\n}\n\nEDIT: That's not the only change that needs to be made. The extension relies on Webkit notifications, which were deprecated and removed in Chrome(ium) and likely other browsers in favor of HTML5 notifications. Therefore, google-chrome/default/Extensions/epckjefillidgmfmclhcbaembhpdeijg/1.0_0/notify_hook.js needs to be updated.

It associates various information with\ndomain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most\nprominently, it translates easily memorized domain names to the\nnumerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating computer\nservices and devices worldwide. The Domain Name System is an essential\ncomponent of the functionality of the Internet.\n\nOther words if you want ping google.com, you need some service that will translate google.com into IP address 173.194.71.139 and then use it. Almost at any time you are querying server by domain name such as google.com DNS translates it to IP address.\nUsually DHCP configure this stuff for you. But in your case it is not, because you configure your network settings manually. And you forget to add dns-nameserver.\nHow to add dns-nameserver\nOpen NetworkManager (press Win, type \"NM\" and you will see Network Connection). Find your connection name, Edit Connections... | Edit... | IPv4 Settings | Additional DNS servers.\n\nHere you can add your DNS, if you want google type 8.8.8.8, if you know your ISP DNS type it.\nIf you do not have GUI, read this answer\n", "Q: apt-get autoremove \"Before uninstall, this module version was ACTIVE on this kernel\" When running apt-get autoremove (or dry run with -s switch), what does the following message mean?\nStatus: Before uninstall, this module version was ACTIVE on this kernel.\n\nAnd what should I do to diagnose if this is going to be a problem?\nEdit: I'm on 13.10 but I think this question is version agnostic?\n\nA: It means that it's going to remove a package that contains a kernel module (or version of a kernel module) that's in use by the system. After removing it and rebooting, you won't be able to load that module.\nWhether or not that's an issue for you really depends on the module and if you're replacing it with something else. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all answer for this other than: read the message and work out if that's a problem. If it is, just reinstall that package and move on.\n\nA: It can also mean that an upgrade has just been done to your system, and that the version of the module which you are being warned about is actually the old version, running only until the next reboot (at which point it would have been removed anyway).\nE.g. I was told that my in-use Broadcom wireless driver was being removed! From looking at the error message (plus a bit of trial and error) I worked out that the command to re-install it was:\nsudo dkms install add bcmwl/6.30.223.271+bdcom\n\nBut on running this I was told that this driver was already installed, at a newer version than the in-use one which I was being warned about.\nIt's still almost certainly better not to just ignore this warning. But it's quite possible that a variant of the above command (modified to fit the package you're being warned about) will tell you that a newer version is installed, in which case the above is what is going on, and the warning is nothing to worry about.\n", "Q: Broken /boot partition: input/output error The Problem\nThe issue I am facing is that I get the following error on boot, after I select Ubuntu in GRUB:\nError: File \"/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic.efi.signed\" not found.  \nunaligned pointer 0xd0a26c68\nAborted.

To do so, make your script owned by root (chown root:root <filename>) and then chmod +s <filename> it. \nOf course you have to be careful which programs you make setuid root, since if the program has a security flaw so its users can make it run arbitrary code, it might be misused to gain full root access.\nRegarding the automatic start after login, I think that indeed \"Startup Applications\" is the place to put it.\n\nA: Fixed it by adding this to sudoers:\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount, /bin/umount\n\nAnd the Startup Applications command was edited so it was /home/user/script/path/script.sh and it started to work.

I want to create partition as we do it in Windows like D: or E: drives etc.\nNow I have done the installation of Ubuntu 13.04 and upgraded it to 14.04.\n\nA: Yes you can but you have to be very carefull as there is a big potential for loosing data if you dont do it right or there is a problem (loss of power)\nBefore touching partitions make sure any important data has been backed up! Also it would be a good idea to do this when you are not restricted with time. If you have something important to do soon, leave it till you have time that should you have problems you have time to work it out.\nAnother note, you cannot modify partitions that are mounted, so you cannot be loaded into ubuntu.\nYou will need to use the live DVD. Look for a program called gparted. It can also be run from the terminal by typing into a terminal\nsudo gparted\n\nIf for some reason its not installed (it should be though in a live installer)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nGparted will allow you to make many different modifications to you partitions. Make sure that you select the right partition to modify. Gparted is fairly easy to understand so you should be able to easily work out what partition to modify.\nMost general linux users will have only 2 partitions. there root partition \\ and a swap partion. (more advanced linux users may have more to seperate the system from there home directory )\nWhen gparted has finished scanning drives, you can select your drive from the upper right side where it says /dev/sdx (xx.xxGB)\nFor example my laptop HD is /dev/sda\nYou will see a bar that is split up and that represents your partitions, also you will see them listed.\nlook at mount point \"/\" is your root partition.\nResizing is simple, right click on the partition you want to resise and select resize move.\nyou will get a dialogue with options on resizing.\nonce you have verified everthing is correct, you can click the apply all changes button.\nDepending on hardware and size of your drive it could take some time to complete. \n", "Q: How to install the gedit markdown-preview plugin on 14.04?

I have only 2 partitions! due to the dualboot I installed without knowing exactly what I was getting into!\nI cannot unmount it and fear there's no other exit strategy... I'd have to uninstall the whole lot again?\n\n\nA: You don't have to delete anything or start over.\nJust boot to the Ubuntu live CD and run Try Ubuntu.\nWhile there are many options you can choose from, one option is to run gparted and resize the two partitions to a small size (just over the size in use).  Move the two partitions so that they are next to each other.\nNow make a a new partition of the extended type.  With the extended partition you can make any number of partitions you want.  Make one for your new Installation (the majority of the drive) and make one for your swap partition.  Depending on the amount of space you have available I'd try to have my swap partition about 4 gigs or equal the size of the amount of ram I have.  (Other swap size recommendations: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nNow run the Ubuntu Installation option and specify \"Something Else\" for the install option.  Specify the new partition you've just created for your new Ubuntu installation.\nWhen it finishes you'll have boot options for each of the OS installation you have.  You can now mount those other partitions that you referenced not wanting and backup any important data you have on them.  After your desired data is backed up, you can delete those partitions using gparted.\n\nA: If you want to get rid of Windows, backup your personal data (Documents, Photos, Music, Videos) to an external device, create a ubuntu-boot-medium of your choice (dvd, usb drive) and select it during startup by selecting it as the startup-device. \nThen, choose 'install ubuntu' from the menu.

I've got a load of Wordpress sites to move around and modify this afternoon. Yay.\nLike any good developer, I want to back up things before I Hulk-out and break everything. The site's files are mostly version controlled (and those that aren't are backed up). The database is something else. There are many sites installed on this server so a central dump isn't as useful as I'd like. I want a site-specific dump.\nOne of the most annoying things about doing this manually is picking out the details from wp-config.php. I wonder if there's a more easy way to process this file and pass its details onto mysqldump in one command.\n\nI have submitted an answer while writing the question but it's by no means the only way of doing this. If somebody can suggest a better way of handling this, let me know. Just be aware that PHP will allow all sorts of nonsense. Anything used here should accept varied but valid PHP.\n\nA: Well while writing the question a few ideas popped into my head. This is the first and it appears to work. Instead of trying to manually parse out the wp-config.php file (which could be in any order), I'm going to pick the lines I actually want and make PHP do all the heavy lifting. Here's what I've got:\neval $((echo '<?php'; awk '/^define/' wp-config.php; echo 'print \"mysqldump -u\".DB_USER.\" -p\".DB_PASSWORD.\" \".DB_NAME.\" > database-\".DB_NAME.\"-\\$(date +%F).sql\\n\";') | php)\n\nWhat this is actually doing is making a fake PHP script in the pipe, sending that to PHP and then using the output to execute. Here's what we have before PHP processes it:\n<?php\ndefine('DB_NAME', 'my_lovely_database');\ndefine('DB_USER', 'oli');\ndefine('DB_PASSWORD', 'oli');\ndefine('DB_HOST', 'localhost');\ndefine('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');\ndefine('DB_COLLATE', '');\ndefine ('WPLANG', '');\nprint \"mysqldump -u\".DB_USER.\" -p\".DB_PASSWORD.\" \".DB_NAME.\" > database-\".DB_NAME.\"-\\$(date +%F).sql\\n\";\n\nWhen that runs in php, it generates a line like so:\nmysqldump -uoli -poli my_lovely_database > database-my_lovely_database-2014-05-14.sql\n\nAnd we tell bash to run that and it creates a new database backup.\nSave this as a function or alias in bash and you'll live a long and happy life.\n", "Q: Why won't the terminal change to my shared folders directory? I have tried cd Desktop/Shared Parallels Folders/Home/Downloads, but linux does not recognise these directories, No such Directory etc. Why?\n\nA: The directory you are trying to cd into contains spaces. The shell does not deal with those easily, it stops at the first one and trerats the next sequence of characters as a separate argument. In other words, what you actually ran was:\ncd Desktop/Shared\n\nWhich does not exist and the shell complained. To get around this, you need to either escape the spaces with a \\:\ncd Desktop/Shared\\ Parallels\\ Folders/Home/Downloads\n\nor to quote the path:\ncd 'Desktop/Shared Parallels Folders/Home/Downloads'\n\nThe above will work if you just open a new terminal because new shell sessions start in your home directory and Desktop is a subdirectory of that. If you are in a different directory, you will need to give the full path like so:\ncd ~/Desktop/Shared\\ Parallels\\ Folders/Home/Downloads\n\nor \ncd \"~/Desktop/Shared Parallels Folders/Home/Downloads\"\n\n~ is just shorthand for your user's home directory. It is the equivalent of /home/youruser.

I followed this link: http://www.instructables.com/id/Setting-Up-Ubuntu-as-a-Kiosk-Web-Appliance/?ALLSTEPS\n to get the initial setup running. \nOnce you have the session created, you may need to edit the kiosk user's ~/.dmrc file to read:\n[Desktop]\nSession=kiosk\n\nsubstituting \"kiosk\" for the browser-only session name. I also created a file in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d similar to the existing 10-xubuntu.conf specifying my kiosk session. It took all of these to get the auto-login to work properly. \nAlso, if using Google Chrome or Chromium check out: http://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start to see all of the policies you can hard-configure into Chrom{e,ium}. Since I'm setting this up for a school computer lab, I found several options that will allow us to curtail certain uses.\nHope this is helpful. I am by no means an uber linux user and I managed to get it that far. Lightdm can be a bit finicky at times. Google will find some good resources but be warned that on Xubuntu 14.04 the lightdm.conf documentation lives at /usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz Several websites list other possibilities. Good luck.    \n", "Q: System doesn't boot anymore.

The result is that the system still doesn't boot. Does someone have an idea about how to resolve the errors?\n\nA: First of all, especially as a beginner, you should never edit files outside your user home directory. Don't manually mess with your system. Let Ubuntu take care of what files it needs when and where.\nThat said: It is a bit more involved but you can repair Ubuntu using a live-dvd or USB stick (USB is faster). I'll guide your through it:\nBoot live-system and gather information\nIt is the same you did when installing Ubuntu. Just make sure to chose \"Try Ubuntu\". When you see the desktop, open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and run the following:\nsudo blkid\n\nwhich will give you a result like this\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"EFI\" UUID=\"70D6-1701\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"68ca53b3\" LABEL=\"OSX\" TYPE=\"hfsplus\" \n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"49526001\" LABEL=\"Recovery HD\" TYPE=\"hfsplus\" \n/dev/sda4: LABEL=\"BOOTCAMP\" UUID=\"FCF67D7DF67D394A\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"c1c76922\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"3b171268\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda8: UUID=\"bf3dd1b7\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\nPlease post the result of this command back here, so that we can help you further. I will continue with the above example.\nChroot into the installed system\nWith chroot you can use a live linux and switch to the Linux installed on your harddrive to repair it. It is important whether your system uses EFI or BIOS. If you have/had Windows 8 on the machine, it is a good indicator for EFI. In the example above there is a small vfat partition that is even called EFI so the above system uses EFI to boot. The two ext4 partitions are Linux partitions. You can just open them from the launcher to see which one contains to root filesystem (contains folders like etc, usr, var, ...). In the above case /dev/sda6 is the root partition and /dev/sda1 is the EFI partition.\nIn a terminal run the following commands to prepare and open the chroot.\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sda6 /mnt\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi\nfor i in dev dev/pts proc sys sys/firmware; do mount --bind /$i /mnt/$i; done\nchroot /mnt\n\nThe EFI partition only needs to be mounted if EFI is actually used, otherwise you can omit that line.\nThe list of partitions you posted indicates you use LVM, so we need to account for that.

You should be able to reinstall the file. In order to do so you will probably have to use a Ubuntu live CD/USB stick to boot the machine. The steps would be\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the local partitions of your machine in your live environment and chroot into the mounted root directory.\n\n*Re-install the linux-image-3.11.0-20-generic which, IIRC, should generate the file for you.\n\n\nI will not be able to further detail these two steps here. Googling for them should turn up some guides that will help you along the way.\nEdit: See emniess' great post who was faster than me and nicely guides you through the process.\n\nA: Sorry to bring up such an old post. I had something similar to this happen and ran into a few roadblocks along the way, here they, and their solutions, are:\nI had a bunch of issues getting apt-get running in chroot. You have to install/run resolvconf from another console:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nYou also have to copy the file over:\nmv mnt/etc/resolv.conf{,.bak}\ncp /etc/resolv.conf mnt/etc/resolv.conf\n\napt-get got stuck a few times and gave all sorts of errors you have to purge it and some other commands I forget.\nYou can verify it worked by looking in /mnt/boot and looking for the boot files.\nWhen you reboot you have to delete /etc/resolv.conf and run reconfigure resolvconf again to get DNS back up. \nTo get grub going again, I had just used \nBoot-Repair previously, but didn't need it again.\nThanks ** mniess**\n", "Q: Pausing a long running program in the terminal? Is there a keyboard key combination that I can use to pause a program running in the terminal? In case it matters, I don't intend to run anything else inside that terminal while the program is paused. I just want to pause the program execution, and resume it later. How can I do this?\n\nA: I know that this answer is a little bit late, but you can use the shortcut Ctrl+s to stop your programme (if you wanna may be read the output or something like this), then you can continue using the shortcut Ctrl+q.\n\nA: Press Control+Z.\nThis will suspend the process and return you to a shell. You can do other things now if you want or you can return to the background process by entering % followed by Return.\nNote that if you're doing this to something that needs to be responsive, you're going to tank the system, but if it's just something like a nano instance, everything should be okay.\n\nA: This is bash job control\nUse CTL-Z to stop the job.\nThen you can type bg to run it in the background, if there's only on job it does exactly that.\nIf you have more than one you can use jobs to list then and use fg %N and bg %N to the desired effect.\nExample:\n\nubuntu@ip-10-170-59-120:~$ find /usr -name \"*.so\"\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/OpenSSL/crypto.so\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/OpenSSL/SSL.so\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/OpenSSL/rand.so\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/_glib/_glib.so\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/_gobject/_gobject.so\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/_gi.so\n/usr/lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.so\n...\n^Z\n[1]+  Stopped                 find /usr -name \n\nubuntu@ip-10-170-59-120:~$ jobs\n[1]+  Stopped                 find /usr -name \"*.so\"\n\nubuntu@ip-10-170-59-120:~$ fg %1\nfind /usr -name \"*.so\"\n/usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/apc.so\n/usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/memcache.so\n/usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/mysql.so\n...\n\nFor anything else not attached to the TTY you can use SIGSTOP and SIGCONT. So for example if you think a daemon is causing problems but you don't know which one it is, you can send the pid SIGSTOP, it's like hitting pause, then check for changes, OK that's not it, and rinse and repeat until you find the problem.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I install the video driver for my Toshiba Satellite on 14.04?

I can just re-enable them and they work fine until I reboot again. What can I do to make gnome restart the same shell extensions on startup? \n\nA: GNOME 3.12 isn't available by default in Ubuntu repositories for 14.04. You must have installed GNOME 3.12 from the Staging PPA of the GNOME Team. They warn that:\n\nThe packages here have been deemed not ready for general use, they have known bugs and/or regressions, sometimes of a critical nature. Mostly things should run smoothly but be prepared to use ppa-purge, when you encounter issues!\n\nSo you should report a bug about it as mentioned on their Launchpad page.\nHowever, the workaround that you may try is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable all the extensions you wish to be enabled at boot.\n\n*Then, run the following command:\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions \n\nThis would list all the extensions that are enabled currently. For example, the output for me is:\n['apps-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com', 'places-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com', 'window-list@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com']\n\n\n*Now, create a file called enable_gnome_extensions.sh inside ~/bin folder with the following text in it:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions \"<output_of_earlier_command_listing_enabled_extensions>\"\n\nFor example, I would put the following line for my enabled extensions:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions \"['apps-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com', 'places-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com', 'window-list@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com']\"\n\n\n*Make this file executable with the following command:\n$ chmod +x ~/bin/enable_gnome_extensions.sh\n\n\n*Add this file to your Startup Applications for it to be executed at login. Follow this answer for how to do it. The \"command\" would be the path to that file.\nReboot to test if it works.\n", "Q: File system type and swap partition during Installation First of all I’m a total newbie with Linux, and after another disappointment from Microsoft with failure to maintain backwards compatibility for my XP Applications I’m ready to give Linux with Wine a try.\nAbout my system:\nOut of the box Dell Vostro 200\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E7200 @ 2.53GHz x2, 64-bit\nMemory: 2GB\nGraphics: Intel G33 (integrated)\nPlease forgive me if this is repeat post, but after much research I’m a bit confused.\nMy questions pertain to the default installation for a standalone Linux system.\nI did format the hard drive as NFTS with only one partition and did the standalone installation. \nAfter the installation I noticed that my hard drive file system type had changed to Ext4 and there is now 3 partitions; \nPartition 1 is 158G Ext4\nPartition 2 is 2.1G (not sure of the file system) \nPartition 3 (shown as Partition 5) is 2.1G swap\nTo me this indicates that the Ubuntu 14.04 installation reformatted the hard drive, changed the file systems and partitioned the hard drive. After the fact my research showed that this is the default configuration for a standalone Linux system. \nQuestion 1)\nI’m fine with and actually prefer this. But does this mean I could have save ~1 hour by not formatting the hard drive?\nQuestion 2)\nDoes this mean my linux-swap is fully configured and I can avoid using Gparted?\nQuestion 3)\nWhere is the other two partitions, and why did the installation use 1,2 and 5?\nThanks \n\nA: 1) Yes, you could simply install Ubuntu.\n2) Yes, swap is on and you can simply use the system.\n3) The partition 2 is extended partition that allows to have over 4 partitions on MBR drive. Every partition in extended partition (called \"logical\") has the number bigger than 4 (since numbers 1-4 are reserved to primary partitions (extended is counted as primary)). Your swap is inside the extended partition.\n\nA: 1) Yes, you waste ~1 hour of your life\n2) Yes\n3) You only have real 2 partitions. Partition 3 is inside the partition 2\n", "Q: How do I install a second disk of a pc game? On a few pc games, they take 2 disks to install. I have Lububtu, and am trying to use wine to install them, which works fine, until it asks for the second disk. I put it in, and it says that there are no files on that disk, and make sure I have the right disk. There is also a box that lets me type in what file I want to use. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I've found that some things struggle because they've used a /media/oli/Disk 1 style path. When you unmount the first disk and replace it you'll end up with /media/oli/Disk 2... Which naturally breaks everything.\nCDs should also be mounted at /media/cdrom which won't change. Assuming that holds true for you, the easiest solution is to launch the installer from there.\nMight also be good to check winecfg to make sure you haven't accidentally hard-coded in a disk name into a drive allocation.\n", "Q: Disk encryption with Lubuntu?

Using the previous example:\nmv info.txt config/information.txt\n\nThis would move the file and change its name.\n\nA: mv [file] [directory]\n\nFor example, to move info.txt from the actual directory into the config/ directory, type mv info.txt config/\n\nAs was pointed out in a correct comment, the above will fail if the user running the command doesn't have write access to either the file or the folder.\nIf you prefix the command with sudo, you are telling the system to run the command as the root user (similar to an Admin account). Example:\nsudo mv info.txt config/\n\nBIG IMPORTANT NOTE:\nOnly use sudo if you are sure you know what you're doing - Ubuntu protects things for a reason.

They change the color of some parts of some pannel but not the background of nautilus in icons view.\n\nA: Roman's solution will work, but actually there's no need to copy the entire Ambiance theme to your .themes directory.  Instead, you can simply create a file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and put any changes you want there, such as\nNautilusWindow * .view {\n background-color: #D8D8D8; \n}\n\nThen restart Nautilus.  The definition in your gtk.css file will override the theme defaults and you'll see the background color you wanted.\n\nA: Just change the system appearance to dark:\nSystem -> Appearance -> Dark\nNautilus will inherit the color scheme.\n\nA: You can edit the gtk-main.css or nautilus.css files.\nI recommend you to try this under your ~/.themes and not system-wide. You may either change the background color of nautilus only or the base theme as a whole, which affects a lot more programs. In this example I will change the background color in the default Ubuntu Theme \"Ambiance\" (in Ubuntu Gnome use the folder Default instead) from white (#ffffff) to a light grey (#D8D8D8). Feel free to pick any other color.\nFor comparison how it looks like in the beginning:\n\nCreate a copy in ~/\nCreate your ~/.themes directory and copy the original Ambiance theme to it.\nmkdir ~/.themes\ncp -R /usr/share/themes/Ambiance ~/.themes/\n\nChange the background color for the whole theme\nIf you want to change the base color for the whole theme, edit the base_color (Hex notation #??????) in gtk-main.css. This changes the background color of other applications (eg: gedit) as well.\nnano ~/.themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css\n\nChange this line:\n@define-color base_color #ffffff;\n\nFor this one:\n@define-color base_color #D8D8D8;\n\nTo save the changes in nano, press Ctrl+O,Enter then Ctrl+X.\nEffect:\n\nChange the background color for nautlius only\nIf you want to change the background color for nautilus, edit nautilus.css.\nnano ~/.themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css\n\nAdd this lines to the beginning of the file.\n NautilusWindow * .view {\n     background-color: #D8D8D8; \n}\n\n\nTo save the changes in nano, press Ctrl+O,Enter then Ctrl+X.\nEffect\n\nTo see the changes you can restart nautilus, logout login or restart your machine.\n\nA: The best way to change colours is to install a theme.\nSo first install Unity Tweak Tool.\nThen create a ~/.themes folder\nThen find and download your preferred theme. This is an example. Unzip the themes in the folder created.\nOpen Unity Tweak Tool and under themes choose the one just installed.\n", "Q: looking for a music player to control speed and transpose songs I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I am looking for a music player that is able to control the speed of a song and transpose it easily. \nI know VLC media player can change the speed but its a bit complicated and its getting annoying after a short time of using it.\nThe player should be able to play .mp3 data, MIDI ability would be  nice but is not necessary.\n\nA: Hard to know, your question is somewhat prone to opinions. My suggestion is Audacity. \nSee http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\nIt is a cross platform application (although frustrating there is not a port for android >_< )\nYou can change the tempo without changing the pitch.

I've been getting so used to vim's hjkl for moving around recently, and find myself wanting to use them right after alt tabbing out of vim.\nWhat would be the best way to map fn + h/j/k/l to left/down/up/right?\nedit: any <modifier> + h/j/k/l would be satisfactory as long as it doesn't conflict with other keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: Try these, no guarantee if it will break anything, but I hope it won't:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you look at the mapping by xmodmap -pke, you see it has four columns of characters mapped to each key, for different modifications. The order for these modifications is like\nkeycode  <x> = <1> <2> <3> <4>\n<1>                      <key>\n<2>                <shift-key>\n<3>        <\"Mode_switch\"-key>\n<4>  <shift-\"Mode_switch\"-key>\n\n*\"Mode_switch\", not completely sure, but I guess maps to nothing by default. Actually, you can see the code for the key with xmodmap and looking for it somewhere at the bottom of the results and finding out what key that code belongs to. What I did was I reassinged it to another key, for example Super_L, which is the lefp super key, with these:\nxmodmap -e \"keysym Super_L = Mode_switch\"\n\nor you can put your own choise in place of Super_L\n\n*Now, go ahead and edit the column for the four keys you wanted to reassign. Let's find them in your xmodmap file:\nxmodmap -pke | grep h\n\namong the output should be line which says\nkeycode 43 = h H h H\n\nedit it so that it's like\nkeycode 43 = h H Left H\n\nto do that, use the command\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 43 = h H Left H\"\n\nand then try if it worked.\n\n*Do that for the rest of the keys you want to map.\nI think this is not likely to break anything serious, as long as you can go back and reedit the keycodes to their originals. The only scary part was where I mapped \"Mode_switch\" to Super_L. (Edit: this actually disabled my super key, which I was able to get back to work by reversing the assignment, that's xmodmap -e \"keysym Mode_switch = Super_L\". Map a key you know would not fail you to Mode_switch)\n\nA: While I sympathize with you (I have a Happy Hacking keyboard, and would love to have the same layout on my laptop, with Fn + ;'[/ for left right up down respectively), the Function key Fn is almost always implemented entirely in the hardware, and there is no way to bind it as a modifier key in software.\n\nA: If any modifier will do, then the following work for AltGr using xmodmap.\nFirst, find the keycodes for h,j,k and l. This may be done running xev in terminal, then pressing the respective keys. For me, the keycode for h is 43. To map this plus AltGr to left, use the command\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 43 = h H NoSymbol NoSymbol Left\"\n\nRepeat for the remaining keys, and you'll be done :)\nTo set on start up, see this Q&A.\n\nA: Since some time xmodmap is depricated! to get a system wide setting you have to use xkb. So edit the language file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ to add your changes there.\nsee https://askubuntu.com/a/898462/34298\n\nA: Here is a full example using Alt_l as the modifier, tested w/ Ubuntu 21.04\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 64 = Mode_switch\" # set Alt_l as the \"Mode_switch\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 43 = h H Left H\" # h\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 44 = j J Down J\" # j\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 45 = k K Up K\" # k\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 46 = l L Right L\" # l\n\nnote: you can use the xev command to find the keycode for any key you may want to use as the modifier\n", "Q: AR9462 working only from command line and only with WEP I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on this machine\nhttp://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/tablets/lenovo/miix-series/miix-2-11-inch/\nIt has several issues that I didn't solved yet, but the most annoying thing is that it has problems with network connection.

In order to view them on a device other than the very TV on which they were recorded we would have to decrypt them first.\n\nDoing so may be illegal depending on copyright laws in your country.\n\nSome older Samsung TVs stored the encryption key together with the video files on an attached USB drive but this is not the case in newer series.\nFor these we need root access to the TV firmware in order to read the encryption key generated from the TV before we can decrypt our recordings. You will find some tools including tools for Linux/Ubuntu from the SamyGo modified firmware support forums.\nYou may be able to adapt them to your settings better than me because my TV is not supported without also replacing it's firmware (which I did not want to do).

(I was expecting 1600*900)\nEdit: Not sure why my question was downvoted. Anyway, since it seems there is no easy way to know for sure the native resolution of the screen, I fetched a screwdriver, took the screen apart to get its reference, and looked it up. It was a 1366x768 indeed, as I feared.\n\nA: Seems like you have solved your problem, I'll just give you tricky hint you can simply open a Terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and type: xwininfo and press Enter you should get a crossed pointer simply click on your desktop with it and it will display info in terminal window about your screen including its geometry for example -geometry 1920x1080+0+0. Also if you want more detailed info run xdpyinfo you'll get a lot of info you can retrieve different info with commands for example: xdpyinfo | grep screen or xdpyinfo | grep resolution or xdpyinfo | grep dimensions and so on...

I also had this problem on a previous version of Ubuntu, but then only saw a black screen.\nI'm using VirtualBox to run this VM, but I'm not sure if that's the problem.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\n\nA: It appears to be a bug in Virtualbox\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11758\nA potential work around is to use VBoxManage, a command line tool, on the HOST\nVBoxManage controlvm virtual_machine_name screenshotpng Ubuntu.png \n\nYou could try taking a screenshot from within the guest (gnome screenshot) and transfer the image to the host (shared folders). \nIf that fails, probably have to wait for a bug fix.\n", "Q: Advanced inertial scrolling configuration Is it possible configure the synaptic inertial scrolling in a way so it is disrupted when any key is pressed on the keyboard?\nTo explain this question: I often use shortcuts. Now when I am for example browsing the Web and scroll back to the top of a website using inertial scrolling, I zoom the site like crazy if I try to open a new tab with Ctrl+T because the browser only detects Ctrl+scrolling.\nThis happens in a lot of applications and is really annoying. I used to like inertial scrolling but as long as this problem persists, I have to disable it.\n\nA: I am afraid this has already been discussed on Xorg and is marked as \"Resolved Fixed\" but won't be fixed since Xorg won't realize when you press Ctrl and inertial scrolling is still in place. (See Peter Hutterer's comment and its analogy with Ctrl).\nSo at least until we have Unity 8(when Xorg is replaced with Mir and hopefully we see this as really resolved), we can only have a wordaround rather than a perfect fix or completely disabling inertial scrolling.\nOne of the fixes I would recommend is to disable Ctrl+scrolling feature in the application itself. This sure is an unclean solution since the problem is still in place but only the effect is removed and you would have to do this for whatever application you most frequently use inertial scrolling.\nFor disabling Ctrl+scrolling feature in Firefox, type about:config in the address bar and then click on \"I'll be careful, I promise!\" Now, in the search bar, type  mousewheel.with_control.action and double click on the first result and set its value to 1, which would only scroll contents instead of zooming. You can set its value to the following values with the corresponding effects:\n\n\n*\n\n*0 (disabled)\n\n*1 (scroll contents)\n\n*2 (go back/forward in your history)\n\n*3 (default, zoom in/out) \n\n\nI'll update the answer if I am able to find a cleaner, better solution.\n\nA: Corner coasting helps! While not a real fix, I found that using the Synaptics driver's CornerCoasting mode instead of the normal (finger-off) inertial scrolling mode helps. Reason: corner coasting mode is active while keeping the finger in the corner and stops immediately when releasing it. While pressing Ctrl during corner coasting still creates the \"Firefox zoom madness\" problem you describe, I found I am very unlikely to do that while I am actively involved in an action (i.e. with the finger on the touchpad rather than finger-off coasting).\nTrying out corner coasting. The following command will set up corner coasting mode:\nsynclient VertEdgeScroll=1 CornerCoasting=1 CoastingSpeed=1 CoastingFriction=0\n\nVertEdgeScroll=1 is because corner coasting only works with edge scrolling, not with two-finger scrolling. If you like corner coasting at both right and bottom edges, add HorizEdgeScroll=1 to the above line. CornerCoasting=1 enables corner coasting mode. CoastingSpeed is the minimum speed of scrolling during coasting, but that seems also to be the minimum cursor speed to trigger it. So I set it to its minimum to make it easiest  to trigger the mode, which else can be tricky (and impossible with something like CoastingSpeed=100). CoastingFriction is a value to let inertial scrolling fade out. We disable it here to keep it going until you lift the finger, different from what is usually desired in finger-off conventional coasting. For more details on these options, see the Synaptics manpage.\nSomething not mentioned in the manpage: corner coasting is seemingly enabled by swiping from a non-corner edge area into a corner area, and then keeping the finger there. So, corner coasting movement stops if you accidentally lift the finger, for a very short time even, by bumping into / over the touchpad edge. The \"move into a corner area\" trigger mode also means, corner coasting won't work or will be difficult to trigger if your TopEdge and BottomEdge parameters leave little or no non-corner area at the edge. These are relevant here as the corner areas are defined by the intersections of edge areas. Also, without an accessibly sized right edge area, triggering corner coasting will also be difficult to impossible. For my hardware (ThinkPad X201), I found these values to work well (yours may be different, it takes some experimenting):\nsynclient RightEdge=4800 TopEdge=2000 BottomEdge=4000\n\nMaking corner coasting stick. While synclient is great for testing settings out with immediate effect, they are lost when restarting X. To make them stick, create a /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/51-synaptics-cornercoasting.conf or similarly named config file as described here (it also works in Ubuntu!). For the above case, the content would be:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Touchpad tweaks\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        Option \"VertEdgeScroll\" \"on\"\n      # Option \"HorizEdgeScroll\" \"on\" # Enable if you want this.\n        Option \"CornerCoasting\" \"on\"\n        Option \"CoastingSpeed\" \"1\"\n        Option \"CoastingFriction\" \"0\"\n\n        Option \"RightEdge\" \"4800\"\n        Option \"TopEdge\" \"2000\"\n        Option \"BottomEdge\" \"4000\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd then restart X to see the effect, of course.\n\nA: Possible substitutes. If you want to disable inertial scrolling altogether because the bug is just too annoying, there are some possible substitutes (not exactly inertial scrolling, but similarly effortless scrolling modes that can be used instead):\nSystem-wide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sensitive Trackpoint on-button scrolling. This uses a ThinkPad trackpoint (but it can be modified for other trackpoints) for scrolling while the middlemouse button is pressed. This is called \"On-Button Scrolling\" in the libinput driver, and \"mousewheel emulation\" in the older evdev driver.\nThe idea is here that you set it so sensitive that a tiny bit of constant pressure will scroll through long pages fast. To configure this, please refer to this question, esp. the answer by @htorque that works best with the libinput driver (the default as of Ubuntu 17.10).\nSpecifically for Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab and Drag extension. This provides a kind of inertial throwing / inertial dragging mode, quite similar to two-finger inertial scrolling. Configure it to use the left mouse button, which is the most similar mode to two-finger inert scrolling on a touchpad. Just use one finger with tap-and-hold and then \"throw the webpage\". This interferes with selecting text of course, but they have a button to disable the extension temporarily.\nThe text selection interference is annoying, but configuring it for any other mouse button on a touchpad makes usage very tricky. (For example, with middle click, which can be configured as two-finger click on the touchpad, it would be: tap with two fingers, tap-and-hold with two fingers, lift one finger, then throw motion as above :D).\n\n*Autoscrolling. See this answer for how to set it up. Also, set up two-finger tapping to create a middle click – in effect just synclient TapButton2=2. Now, a two-finger-click will bring up the autoscroll element in Firefox, and placing the mouse pointer away from it will permanently scroll into that direction until a click. Sadly, moving the pointer has to be done with one finger. (It just does not work with two fingers, even when two finger scrolling is disabled.) And I could not find out how to invert the scroll direction of this feature to be \"natural\".\n", "Q: How to get autocompletion with \">|\"?

After conversion each converted file should be in the same folder as the original xlsx file.\nExample:\nX/\n Folder 1/\n Folder 2/\n         Folder 2.1/file.xlsx\n Folder 3/\n Folder 4/\n         Folder 4.1/anotherFile.xlsx\n\nAfter conversion:\nX/\n Folder 1/\n Folder 2/\n         Folder 2.1/file.xls\n         Folder 2.1/file.xlsx\n Folder 3/\n Folder 4/\n         Folder 4.1/anotherFile.xls\n         Folder 4.1/anotherFile.xlsx\n\nThe new xls* in this case, will be converted on the same folder as the original xlsx.

Just some brief comments: note that my 'experience' (ha!) is with RAID 0; if you are mirroring from first to second disk (RAID 1) then some of what I suggest below may not apply - others much more experienced than me may help better.\n\n\n*\n\n*you haven't said what RAID (0 or 1) you set up.\n\n*The RAID'd disks should appear as one device - if you do anything at all to individual disks I suspect you may kill the raid.\n\n*linux will use either mdadm or dmraid to assemble the raid array, and present the RAID device in /dev/mapper/(something).  dmraid is older and reportedly barely /not maintained, but some folk need it if dual-booting with MS-Win on the same RAID.  mdadm is the supposedly preferred modern alternative (but won't work on my hardware).  From my reading of Ubuntu discussions, I think U uses mdadm behind the scenes for your install.\n\n*If the raid is recognized/assembled, then in /dev/mapper you should see a file called 'control' and then  a file with a name like md (the whole raid device), plus md1, md2, md3 representing any partitions in the whole raid device.  The names might be much longer but should resemble each other with different numeric endings.  If you've only got the 'control' device and one other device, then I guess you've not created any partitions on the RAID yet.\n\n*You report it fails with \"The RAID arrays all say: /dev/mdx doesn't contain a valid partition table\".  I suspect that means just what it says; either the raid array has not been assembled (by mdadm) or more likely you haven't created a partition within the RAID on which to do the install. (or you're trying to look on the individual drives rather than looking at the RAID in /dev/mapper)\n\n*Installations are done to the raid device representing the partition you want to install on, in /dev/mapper/9something).  Don't go near /dev/sda or /dev/sdb; they are not the raid device and basically don't exist if you are in RAID 0.\n\n\nHope that much perspective helps, and is not out-of-keeping for how Ubuntu does it.\nTonyb\n", "Q: Install wowmatrix I am trying to install wowmatrix (http://www.wowmatrix.com/)\nto manage my wow addons. however when running the .sh file it brings up an install window. but there is no text just blank buttons. \n\nA: my message before was delete cause was another question like you...but now i have the solution!...googling i found topic in the wowmatrix faq...if you  miss libgtk2.0-0:i386 you cant see the word on the screen \nsudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386\nand i can run wowmatrix...i put a link where i got it\nhttp://www.wowmatrix.com/faq/ubuntu-ia32-libs\n", "Q: How do I enable ccache?

Thank you :)\n\nA: There is a .minecraft folder, it's just hidden.\nEverything that starts with a dot is hidden in Ubuntu (or any other Linux/UNIX OS).\nTo get in this folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your file manager\n\n*Click on Home\n\n*Press CTRL + H\n\n*Search for .minecraft and open it\n\n*Press CTRL + H again to hide hidden files and folders\n\n\nHowever there is no minecraft.jar anymore. You can now install multiple versions of Minecraft at the same time, so JARs have moved to versions/1.7.9/1.7.9 for example.\n", "Q: What type of partition table and file system is required to make a live usb? I see a bunch of stuff on using usb-creator to make a live usb for ubuntu which is great.  \nWhat I don't see is what type of partition table and file system is required on the USB itself.  Does it have to be fat32?\nPlease provide partition table ID, and file system type as well as commands:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdb\n# Make bootable and chose ID = c (W95 fat32 (lba) )\nsudo mkfs.vfat -n 'ubuntu' /dev/sdb1\n\n\nA: As other people have already said, if you use the Ubuntu's \"Startup Disk Creator\" and then check the filesystem type it turns out to be FAT32. But what was not said is that there is no need to format a USB disk before creating the installation/boot disk. The reason is that you are probably using the ISO image of the installation disk. The ISO image contains a complete filesystem inside (an ISO9660 file system) and is copied byte-by-byte to the USB stick.\nSo it does not matter what type of filesystem you create before copying ISO image, since it will be replaced by the filesystem of ISO image.\nP.S. and of course there is no need to use the Ubuntu's \"Startup Disk Creator\" since good old dd command will do the same job much faster\n$ sudo dd if=/path/to/ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=2048\n\nNote that you have to give the dd command the path to the drive /dev/sbX (i.e. USB stick), not the path to a particular partition /dev/sdX1, /dev/sdX2 or whatever.\nAlso note that setting blocksize bs=2048 will make the copying process much faster.\n\nA: My USB is formatted fat32.  If you use \"Start-up Disk Creator\", you should not have any problems with a fat32 formatted USB stick.  Just give it the ISO you want copied and it will do the rest for you.\nAfter creating my 14.04LTS bootable USB for installation, Disk Utility shows format is W95 Fat32 Bootable.  Done automatically by Startup Disk Creator, hope this helps.\n\nA: To make live USB you can put USB format to fat32 or ntfs or ext4 after installing Ubuntu to usb it turns to bootable. Coming to partition table you don't need any partition table you can install on whole USB or if you want you can create a partition table and set one partition space enough for ubuntu live usb and format to any above three. You can select your partition drive at unetbootin usb options. \nPersonally i don't prefer ntfs because it will be slow it wont be like hard disk. I recommend to use fat32.\nIf you create a partition table create only one live usb partition don't use two at a time only the second will work.\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: Can't resize partition I'm trying to make my Windows partition bigger so I made my Ubuntu partition 150 GBs smaller. Now when I try to resize my Windows partition it won't go bigger -- it only gives me the option to make it smaller. How do I enlarge my partition?\n\n\nA: To resize your /dev/sda2 partition, you have to boot from Ubuntu live disk or gparted live disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu live disk.\n\n*Open gparted partition editor from dash. If gparted is not installed by default then install it by running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gparted command on terminal(Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Make sure that all the partitions are unmounted before trying to resize.\n\n*Now right-click on /dev/sda3 and select resize option. Move the dragger to the extreme right so that  150 GB of unallocated space would comes before /dev/sda3 partition.\n\n*After that, you can be able to resize your /dev/sda2 Windows partition.\n\nA: You just cant do it without having newly boot and do partition preferable during installation  time . resizing partition may be allowed by some third party software but its going to harm your computer hard-disk. or if you join two partition or devide into two partition may be your system file will be corrupted and you will be unable to browse over windows or ubuntu . neither you can use kde partition manager and kvpm ,this will be avilable in ubuntu software center. or for in case windows you can use many third party software avilable\n", "Q: install grub after copy ubuntu i need to install grub on a new hard drive.\ni have a 1tb hard drive with linux mint on it.\ni also have a dual boot 40gb hard drive with windows xp and ubuntu 12.04lts with grub to chose an os.\ni want to copy the ubuntu install from the 40 gb drive on to the bigger drive i have done this already (http://paste.ubuntu.com/7465749/)\ni have copied the ubuntu install and put it on the new hard drive with linux mint already on it using gparted in linux mint.\nso after i have done this how can i install grub on the 1tb drive to chose an os at boot ?\n\nA: If you are planning to remove the old 40GB hdd, you should ensure that GRUB and /boot partition are installed onto the second drive. There is good instruction in How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nAlternatively, you can use Boot Repair's Recommended repair. It will place GRUB on all drives.\nHowever, Linux Mint uses GRUB too, and if you put the GRUB onto 1TB drive (/dev/sdb) when you did install it, you just need to boot into Mint and run sudo update-grub. It should print that it found Ubuntu.\nResume: check if Mint starts from the second hdd, and if it will, just run sudo update-grub in it. If not, use Boot Repair or install GRUB manually.\n", "Q: Dropdown menu is showing less items , when I right-click on the desktop How would I add an office application on a drop-down menu (from right-click)? When I right-click inside folders and on desktop it shows only a couple items, I want a Windows-like drop-down menu. Please how would I make this as default?\n\nA: Actually you don't need to add liber-office application on right click menu. One of the best part of Linux OS is it is an extension independent. You can right click open new document and rename it to file.doc or file.ods or file.odt or file.ott or file.txt(for text document) whatever you want just add extension. So no need to have so many items on right click menu everything goes with a single file.\nI hope that helps\n\nA: I edited this first (so I hope I got what you were asking right) You would like to add an application to your drop-down correct?\nIf you check this post, it may help, but I am not sure how up to date/out of date the program is. \nAdding extra options to right-click menu\nIt looks like some people have used the above mentioned for 14.04 (nautilus-actions). \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nae-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions-extra\nnautilus -q\n\n\n*\n\n*Above is from this link:  http://www.webupd8.org/2011/12/nautilus-actions-extra-pack-of-useful.html*\n\n\nYou will also need to run the actual program with elevated privileges.\n", "Q: Set individual file priority (single torrent): Transmission Is there a way to set priorities per file in a given torrent?

If not, is there other software that will do this?\n\nA: In Properties on the Files tab, expand the window so that the priority column is visible.  You may have to make the name column narrower.\nThen click on the text of the priority, where it says 'Normal'.  Each click cycles through Low, Normal, High.\n\nA: Deluge has that option to give priorities(like high,low,normal) to individual files inside the download file.\nYou can install deluge from software centre or from terminal with this command\n\n\nsudo apt-get install deluge\n\n\n\nA: QBittorrent also has the options to set priority for downloaded files.\nsudo apt-get install qbittorrent\n\nSee screenshot below:\n\n\nA: Transmission 2.82 also allows priority to be changed in the torrent's Properties->Options tab, at the bottom of the Speed section.\n\nA: You might be facing the same thing that I noticed...\nIn [Torrent] Properties -> Files (tab), try to resize the \"Names\" column making it smaller then the rest of the options (have, download, options) should appear.\nThis is probably a bug in the GTK interface about the horizontal scrolling.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 HDMI no sound on TV I plugged in the HDMI-emphasized text cable from  my TV and plugged it in my desktop and when I restarted the computer it has a clear picture but no sound at all.  \nI have looked for a solution but can't find one.\nI have downloaded and installed these and still don't have sound:\nalsa-hda-dkms_0.201204101019~maverick1_all.deb\nalsa-hda-dkms_0.201210261053~natty1_all.deb\noem-audio-hda-daily-dkms_0.201405091731~ubuntu14.04.1_all.deb\n\n\nA: Go to system settings.

I've downloaded multiple server copies from various sources, and even one desktop copy as well. I also tried downloading 13.10. None of them work. Each time I've loaded the iso file onto my usb using both the pendrive and unetbootin programs. When using the pendrive program, it seemed to transfer however it showed many errors in files copied. When I used unetbootin I got as far as loading it onto the desktop and getting a message saying 'invalid or corrupt kernal image'.\nI've used the MD5sum checks on every file and none of the have equaled the same sum.\nOne last desperation try of loading it on (14.04 LTS \"Trusty Tahr\" - Release amd64 (20140416.2)), and my desktop recognizes it.The UNetbootin screen comes up and I select Default.

I get the same error as before.\nI went to Software & Updates and under Other Software tab I removed the bad repository: http://download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/14.04/main, and then I could update my repositories. But I cannot install the Intel Graphics Driver!\nI hope I'm making sense. This is the first day this is available, so I'm counting on Intel to fix this soon, if not, I hope someone can help find a work around.\n\nA: The installer contains the wrong repository url. To fix this you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the installer and try to install, you got error, close installer.\n\n*Open console and type:  \nsudo -H gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list\n\n\n*Replace text with text below, don't close gedit just leave it: \ndeb https://download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/14.04/main/ trusty main #Intel Graphics drivers\n\n\n*Start the installer again, press Begin button, press Install button and fast switch to gedit and hold CTRL+S.\nsudo apt-get update may yield:\nGPG error: https://download.01.org trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A902DDA375E52366\n\nFix it with:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A902DDA375E52366\n\n\nA: Here's the easier solution for those with problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus(file explorer), go to Edit -> Preferences -> Behavior, and make sure that under Executable text files, Ask each time is selected! (if not, select it)\n\n*Close the window\n\n*Open Nautilus (if not already open)\n\n*Right click New document > Empty document\n\n*Name it script.sh \n\n*Open it and enter this:\n#! /bin/bash\nwhile [ 1 ]; do\n    sudo sed --in-place 's/http:/https:/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\n\n*Save it and close it\n\n*Right click on script.sh and select Permissions \n\n*Check Allow executing this file as program\n\n*Close the window\n\n*Double click it\n\n*Select Run in terminal\n\n*Enter password\n\n*DO NOT close the terminal\n\n*Begin installation, and everything should work\n\n\nI also got Failed to fetch download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/14.04/main/pool/main/i/… Size mismatch error and this fixed the problem. You can delete script file and close the terminal when the installation is finished.\nEdit: There is simpler way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter this in terminal:\n#! /bin/bash\nwhile [ 1 ]; do\n    sudo sed --in-place 's/http:/https:/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\n\n*Enter password\n\n*Run the installer\n\n\nA: Use gdebi to install the intel-linux-graphics-installer and you won't have the GPG problems. It should automatically install with the deb package. Use the following commands to do so:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gdebi\ncd && wget https://download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/14.04/main/pool/main/i/intel-linux-graphics-installer/intel-linux-graphics-installer_1.0.6-0intel1_amd64.deb\nsudo gdebi intel-linux-graphics-installer_1.0.6-0intel1_amd64.deb\nintel-linux-graphics-installer\n\nFollow the instructions displayed in the GUI to update your system. Save any unsaved work and reboot for the changes to take effect.\n\nFurthermore, using\nsudo apt-key adv\n\nIs considered a security risk and is not recommended as you are \"undermining the whole security concept as this is not a secure way of recieving keys for various reasons (like: hkp is a plaintext protocol, short and even long keyids can be forged, …)\". http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2195579\nI believe the correct way is to first import the key\nGET https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg | gpg --import\n\nCheck the fingerprint\ngpg --check-sigs --fingerprint 75E52366\n\nGet the key from the keyserver\ngpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key 7CB0FA13\n\nExport the key to your keyring\ngpg -a --export 75E52366 | sudo apt-key add -\n\nRepeat for second key\nGET https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg-2 | gpg --import\n\ngpg --check-sigs --fingerprint 2F4AAA66\n\ngpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key 144BD458\n\ngpg -a --export 2F4AAA66 | sudo apt-key add -\n\nmore info http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7.en.html#s-deb-pack-sign\n", "Q: No Video Graphics (Cinnamon Fallback Mode) After installing a .package file (LaCie Network Manager), I restarted my computer and the login screen does not appear anymore.

I have Lubuntu 14.04 (and Ubuntu 14.04) on a pair of USB disks created by writing the img files to USB using dd on Mac OS X.\nUnfortunately these systems both have some known bugs (that have since been corrected) and lack certain important drivers for my system (which I have located online).\nHow can I make the USB disks writable and how do I update the distribution upon them as one may do for a locally-installed system?\nAnd if I later proceed to install from these USB sticks onto a hard-drive, will they ‘carry’ the package and driver updates with them or will I have to start from scratch again? (I seem to remember from my ancient Windows XP days that such procedures were referred to as ’slipstreaming’ or somesuch on that side of the fence.)\n(No, I did not create a persistence partition when I created the sticks, because from Mac clearly that isn’t an option. And anyway, as I imperfectly understand it, the persistence partition is for user files and not for the modification of the system.)\n\nA: You need persistence.\nPersistence is not only for user files but also for updates.\nYou can create persistence on a Mac\nDownload Unetbootin and create the liveUSB with it.\nInstallation doesn't replicate updates\nWhen you use the liveUSB to install Ubuntu, it will not install the updates done in the live system.\n\nA: This is the answer i got from Thibaut Lauziere\nSAN Engineer / LiLi's Developer:\nNope you can't. That's a restriction of Live USBs. You have to create your key using an already updated ISO.\n", "Q: argument-aware alias command? I want to create an alias for curl which automatically writes the file it curls into a file with the same name in the current directory.\nFor example:\n% curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py\n\nIs there a way to make the alias read the following argument and insert it into the actual executed script like this?\n\nA: Aliases don't handle arguments. Fortunately, functions do:\nmycurl () {\n    curl \"$1\" > \"${1##*/}\"\n}\n\nWhere ${1##*/} is a form of Parameter Expansion which says \"Remove everything to the last slash in $1\".\n\nA: If you needed to do this, I'd do it with a bash function or (in even more complicated circumstances) in its own script file in ~/bin/...\nBut you  could just use wget instead of curl. It should do what you're asking by default and as an added bonus, you'll get to sidestep the issue that is a URL without a specified file (eg: http://example.com/).\n\nA: There are some workarounds, where you can use combination of environment variables (PWD), command substitutions or IO redirections inside the aliases. Here is some closest example (in Bash):\nalias curl='xargs -I% curl -o \"%\" \"%\" <<<'\n\nwhich will save file with the same name as the URL:\n$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\nWarning: Failed to create the file https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n\nThis can be further corrected by converting that URL into filename by manipulating string using shell operations, command substitution, basename, awk or some other tools.\nAlternatively you can always point your curl to wget:\n$ alias curl=wget\n$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n'get-pip.py' saved\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - No such file or directory I'm trying to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Eclipse EE Kepler (eclipse-jee-kepler-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64)\n\n*Oracle Express Edition (oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm)\n\n\nwhenever I try to access/install oracle setup using rpm (I've installed rpm) I encounter error, i.e. \n\nNo such file or directory exists.\n\nAnd in case of Eclipse,\nIf I try to extract eclipse file using tar command, still I get the same error of no such file or directory exists.\n\nA: Always try to use the package manager for your installations, so you support a long service life of your system as the packages within the package manager are trusted and verified.\nThe standard way to install packages is through the terminal. Within Ubuntu you have more \"user friendly\" applications like the Ubuntu software center.\nThrough the terminal you initiate every installation within Debian based distributions (like Ubuntu) with \nsudo apt-get install\nextended with the package name you want to install.\nFor example, if you want to install eclipse you use\nsudo apt-get install eclipse\nBefore you install a program always favour the installation through the package management system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/package-management.html for further information. I hope this was a help to get started.\n\nA: try installing synapic package manager then click update then apply then try what you was doing before see if that works\n", "Q: What are the alternatives of Lusca in 14.04?

I have replaced XP with Ubuntu 14.04 and the free stand alone applications that used to work on XP will not install on Ubuntu. What can i do to get the applications installed and working. The error received says something to the likes of unable to Archive.......... \nThanks\n\nA: Programs for Windows do not work on Linux (except if you use wine).\nSome software is available for multiple platforms. For example, Libreoffice and Firefox are available for Windows and Linux.\nSome software is available only for Windows. The good news is that for most Windows only software there is an \"equivalent\" on Linux. Search the Software Center and the internet to find the closest equivalent to the software you're trying to substitute.\nLastly, if you really need a windows program with no real equivalent for linux, you can try installing \"wine\" and try installing it on linux. Not all software will work but many will.\n\nA: Windows and Ubuntu are two different systems. Therefore you can't just run Windows applications on Ubuntu and vice versa.\nThere is an emulator for Windows applications on Ubuntu (called Wine), but as you said in the comments you only want to use those programs to write an ISO to USB or CD, so I'll just explain how to do that using Ubuntu's own tools.\n\nISO to USB\nYou can write an ISO to USB using dd.\nNote: by using dd you'll destroy all data on your destination drive. Also be sure to specify the right destination drive, because if you specify the wrong destination drive all data will be gone and most of it wil be unrestorable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Execute the following command:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nReplace /path/to/image.iso by the path to the ISO file you want to write and /dev/sdb by the device path of the (USB) drive you want to write the ISO file to.\nThis command will just write the contents of the ISO file bit for bit to the destination drive, including the MBR (if there's one) and the whole partition layout, so it'll be bootable.\nYou can find the device path of your USB drive this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Execute the following command:\nlsblk\n\n\n*You'll see a list of device paths. You can use the size to determine which one is your USB drive, or you can run the command before you insert the USB drive and after you insert the USB drive, to see what has changed.\nNote: in this case you'll not need the partitions (/dev/sda1 is partition 1, /dev/sda2 is partition 2 etc), but the drive itself (/dev/sda).\n\nISO to CD\nTo write an ISO to disc you can simply use Ubuntu's file manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your file manager\n\n*Browse for the ISO file\n\n*Right click on the ISO file and click on Write to Disc...\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions\n\n\n\nKali ISO\nYou can find a link to the Kali ISO here.\n\nA: If you really need a Windows environment to use Windows only programs you also have the option to install ubuntu parallel to Windows or install Windows as a guest system within Ubuntu (use https://www.virtualbox.org/) or install Ubuntu as a guest system witin Windows (use https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide). I asume you had your reasons for migrating to Ubuntu and there are really a lot of useful substitutes for Windows programs within the Ubuntu ecosystem. And they are getting better and better.\n", "Q: Chromium does not start (launch seems to start but not opening the application) Ubuntu 14.04 fully updated every day\nChromium does not start since some more days. No idea why.\nI uninstalled and made new installation from Synaptic just now.\nNo error message  at installation.\nStill no application window after launch.\nI can watch the 'launch icon' (turning telephone dial) being activate for some more seconds untill it disappears , followed by ...NOTHING. Not even an error message.\nThe program worked already before without problem on the same PC.\nSecondary less important problem is that dragging the icon fom the \"Search\" window to the Unity launchbar (left) does not work; unless maybe  I need more as simple mouse dragging action ? The icon (copy) follows my mouse pointer, but when left mouse button is released, the icon is not dropped into the launch bar.\nMaybe this indicates that some installation module is not performed ? A normal installation would normally add the application icon into the launch bar ? Isn't that a mandatatory requirement for Unity?\nThank you for advice.\nUPDATE 29 July 2014\nI have been silent for some time.\nSorry but I was thinking to give up on Ubuntu or Linux all together.\nBecause this issue occurs for both user accounts on the same PC2, using the same installed version Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the suspicion on a bad profile folder would make no sense,  (unless both profiles were bad at same time, and not working as expected   for Chromium ONLY).\nI was hoping that this problem would disappear just the same way as it appeared for no reason or explanation whatsoever. In the mean time several system updates were made but that wouldn't clear the problem.\nI now re-installed Chromium again. No errors were reported. Chromium IS installed (verified with Synaptic and with 'Files' under section 'Installed').\nStill the situation persists. I don't know how to start Chromium on my PC2, while on PC1 (running the same Ubuntu version) Chromium is running even smoother than Firefox.\nOn PC2 there is no lauch icon on the desktop.\nIs there any practical method to start an installed program ?\nI will report my conclusions for another attempt, using Terminal (as already suggested before)\nAnyway I would appreciate some help.\nFacing that much problems encountered so far with Linux, it might not be such a bad idea at all coming to Windows purchasing a new PC.\nThank you\n\nA: I suspect there is a problem with the user profile folder. Try renaming the ~/.config/chromium folder to something else.\nYou will loose everything (bookmarks, history, addons, etc). If Chromium works like this, then you may try to recover your old user data from the renamed folder a bit at a time.\n\nA: I think I had the same problem on 16.04. I installed chromium but it never worked. After reading previous comment, I took a look at ~/.config/chromium folder (/home/username/.config) and the chromium folder was the unique one with root owner and no permissions.

I have been looking around for a backup utility to handle breaking up my home folder backup across a set of blu-ray discs. Aside from using brasero to manually add each file and folder I want include, is there a better way to do this?\n\nA: I've never tried it but Dkopp claims to be able to do this:\n\nDkopp is a program used to copy or back-up disk files to DVD or BD (Blue-ray) media. Full or incremental backups can be done, with full or incremental media verification. A GUI is used to navigate through directories to select or de-select files or directories at any level. Backup jobs can be saved for later re-use. New, deleted, and updated disk files are handled automatically, without re-editing the backup job. An incremental backup updates the same DVD/BD media used for a prior full backup. Files can be restored to the same or another location on disk. Large backup jobs can be done using multiple DVD media.\n\n", "Q: How to add bookmark that connects to local server?

There I could add something like the username, host, port etc. \nI use ubuntu 12.04. Please let me know how to add the bookmark.\n\nA: what do you mean with \"bookmark\"? I remember that once in gnome terminal you can add some bookmarks (and now that feature doesn't exist no more, AFAIK) but I don't remember that it was possible export such bookmarks from a computer to another one.\nIf you're looking for something exportable, maybe you can drop down a little script doing something like\ngnome-terminal -e \"ssh -X [and whatever you want] user@hostname.domain\"\n\nCheers,\nSilvia\n\nA: This is how I solved it:\n Open the file browser (Nautilus) go to File -> Connect to Server\nNow enter in the field Server Address\nssh://myuser@myserver.de\n\nA folder to this server will appear in Nautilus.

How can I delete the files of index greater than, say 100?\n\nA: You may try this command also,\nfor i in $(seq 100 100000); do rm fileName_$i; done\n\nIt will delete all the files(ranges from 100 to 100000) if the filename contains numbers in an sequential order.\n\nA: In general you have several ways to achieve this:\nrm fileName_{100..100000}\n\nwill be expanded by the shell into roughly 100,000 filenames. If the basename is a long path and the number is high enough, you might actually exceed the maximum length of a command line with this approach.\nThe for loop \nfor i in $(seq 100 100000); do rm fileName_$i; done\n\ndoes not suffer from this problem, but is a relatively slow way of deleting the files, as the shell has to perform the variable substitution and launching rm about 100,000 times.\nBoth methods above might cause warnings if some of the files, say filename_101 were missing.\nUsually, solutions based on find are better, as they only work on files that are actually there (during discovery). However, there are some subtle differences:\nfind . -name 'fileName_[100-100000]' -exec rm {} \\;\n\nwill still launch the rm program about 100,000 times, while replacing the final \\; by + will try to minimize the number of subprocesses. Both methods will probably be (much or a bit) slower than using -delete which does not use external commands at all but invokes system calls instead.\nHowever, always check first if the pattern actually matches the files that you want to target: \nstefan@tuxedo ~ % mkdir askubuntu\nstefan@tuxedo ~ % touch askubuntu/filename_{1..1000}\nstefan@tuxedo ~ % find askubuntu -name 'filename_[100-1000]' \naskubuntu/filename_1\n\nSo in this case you'd delete a file you wanted to keep and left the files that should have been removed.\n\nA: Use the following command:\nfind . -name 'fileName_[100-100000]' -exec rm {} \\;\n\nThat will delete files from 100 to 100000 .\nMore information: Site\n\nA: If filenames are numbered sequentially just run the following command:\nrm fileName_{100..100000}\n\n", "Q: Postfix installed, by mail() in PHP not working I have a new server.

(Are there criteria to test if they're trustworthy?) (Note: no disrespect whatever to the hard work people that people who run 3rd-party repositories put in.)\nI came across a package repository, a ppa, that was suggested for getting php5.5 on Ubuntu 12.04. This has to be added to the list of repositories that Ubuntu knows to download software.\nIn general, can such 3rd-party repositories be trusted? \nIn this particular case, the ppa seems to be well regarded - and I would certainly want to support this and recommend it.\nIs there a checklist or criteria one can follow to arrive at a decision to trust a 3rd-party repository?\nThe aim here is to avoid downloading malware or anything else that may damage the computer.\n\nA: In my opinion, you can't technically trust a PPA. If it uploads a newer version of a certaing package, you will autmatically get the new one. By that, a PPA can technically replace any package on your system. (Source: German article on ubuntuusers.de).\nWhen I install a PPA I look for its reputation on the web. I note down what I use it for and deactivate it as soon as I don't need the packages served by it anymore. Furthermore, I usally take a look which packages are offered by the PPA.\nAnother solution I heard of (which is honestly too complicated for me) is to add the PPA and install the desired package (and ONLY the package).

If not you could copy the file from your USB:\ncp /path/to/file /mnt/hdd/path/to/file\n\nNotice your hard disk root is actually /mnt/hdd and that / is your USB drive.\nOnce complete you can unmount your drive:\n$ cd /mnt/\n$ umount hdd\n$ reboot\n\nHopefully this helps, although not in all cases it will\n", "Q: Can't extend partition on xubuntu I have xubuntu remix and xubuntu dual booted.

This was a bit clunky but it worked for simple configuration.\nNow I've no idea how the Naga Hex presents its little thumb-pad... It could just be throwing out extra mouse buttons (make the most sense) or it could be acting as a software-driven keyboard. I'd personally be optimistic about making it work the way you wanted to, but that might only come after a battle.\n\nThis Arch Forums suggests it presents as a mouse and a keyboard (groan) so you'll likely need some form of Windows around to keep it configured.

I have  intalled the i-Nex so to know my cpu frequency at every time. But there is a problem: Even when I'm editing a video, the cpu runs at 2.4Gh with 80-100% cpu load! But the intel turbo boost technology does not get enabled, while when i was using windows, these things were happening automatically! \nSo, how can i enable the Turbo feature? This feature is enabled in bios settings\nEdit: I Think that this could help, but i'm not so sure: CPU Turbo boost: modify temperature limit under 14.04\n\nA: I don't think you know what you are talking about, because you describe something that is very different from how this technology was initially supposed to work.\nTurbo Boost, glitter for standard clock speed\nTurbo boost will not automatically overclock your CPU if both of your cores are already constantly at 80-100% load. Some later variations (depending on the CPU model) will boost under full load for very short intervals to then cool down with negligible long term performance impact. All in all you won't achieve a constant overclocking boost, because as I said, this is not how this feature is designed.\nThemal design and cooling\nAlso one should first provide a better cooling solution before trying to mess with the  thermal thresholds that the system designers and engineers carefully defined during the product development. In general, you should never even think about modifying temperature limit for laptops (as the other question initially asked for).\nPossible traps: the wrong monitoring tool\nThere was some confusion when Turbo Boost was introduced, because some tools that monitored the frequency and/or changed governors interfered with Turbo Boost and prevented it from properly working.\n\nSome hardware monitoring applications or panel-applets that allow to display or modify processor clock speeds bring disorder into the fragile arrangement, hence one should stay away from these when in doubt [if turbo boost is working correctly].\n\nOriginal citation in German:\n\nEinige Hardware-Monitoring-Programme oder Panel-Applets zur Anzeige\n  oder Konfiguration der Prozessor-Taktstufen bringen dies fragile\n  Gefüge aber durcheinander, daher lässt man von diesen im Zweifel\n  besser die Finger.\n\nHeise: Turbo Boost unter Linux (probably better known for its English site The H)\nConlusion\nWhile you can try the link (which is not about Turbo Boost but P-States, which is more technical and about power management) posted in an answer on the other question, you have to realize Turbo Boost is not about constant overclocking under constant heavy load, but improving performance for short bursts, which won't reduce workloads like video editing significantly.\nAlso you have to realize that marketing (deliberately conf-)uses higher specs that are only achieved in certain boost conditions (or sometimes never, like on some ultrabooks), instead of the standard clock speeds. (This is not very new, the Pentium 4 processors have been known for clocking lower due to overheating, it just got more complicated and made its way to graphics cards, tablet and smartphone processors.)\nSimply speaking, if you bought a product with a 2 core CPU at a clock speed of 2.4 GHz and thought you get a 4 core CPU with 3 GHz clock speed or something in between, then realize that you have been fooled or the one who sold you the product didn't know any better.\n\nA: I think you just have the terminology wrong. You may have meant to refer to Intel EIST, which is what reduces clock speed when idle, or C1E, which is what reduces voltage. Turbo Boost is what boosts core speed above 2.4GHz when the CPU is under heavy use, though the reachable speed depends on temperature and how many cores are in use.\nIn your BIOS, you should enable all three: Enable Intel EIST so the CPU speed drops when the CPU is idle, enable Intel C1E so it uses less current as well when idle, and enable Turbo Boost so when you are using it, the CPU speed can go above 2.4GHz.\nYou do not need to do anything to Ubuntu to take advantage of any of these features.  Ubuntu sends all the proper signals to the CPU, telling it when it's idle and when to ramp up clock speed, to allow these features to work, and you do not have to adjust any of this.\n", "Q: How do I pause for the specific time between two commands in a script? I want to do something like following:\n#!/bin/bash\ncommand1\n<pause for 30 seconds>\ncommand2\nexit\n\nHow can I do it?\n\nA: You can use read -t. E.g:\nread -p \"Continuing in 5 seconds...\" -t 5\necho \"Continuing...\"\n\nIn your script:\ncommand1\nread -p 'Pausing for 30 seconds' -t 30\ncommand2\n\nNote that you can press Enter to bypass the timeout period.\n\nA: You can use this in a terminal: \ncommand1; sleep 30; command2\n\nIn your script:\n#!/bin/bash\ncommand1\nsleep 30\ncommand2\nexit\n\nSuffix for the sleep time:\n\n\n*\n\n*s for seconds (the default)\n\n*m for minutes\n\n*h for hours\n\n*d for days\n\n", "Q: Nautilus connect to server in Ubuntu 14.04 fails to connect to iSeries V5R4 I have been successfully using the (excellent) Nautilus 'Connect to Server' feature for some time prior to Ubuntu 14.04 to access network drive shares on IBM iSeries (AS/400, IBMi, i5) running OS/400 at versions of V5r4 and v7r1.\nHaving installed Ubuntu 14.04 recently I find that I can still connect to an iSeries running at v7r1, but when I try and connect to a system running v5r4 I get an error message:\n\nOops! Something went wrong.\n  Unhandled error message: Failed to mount Windows share: Connection timed out\n\nThis had previously worked on all versions from 12.04 up to and including 13.10. I am running Files version 3.10.1.\nSince our main development box is v5r4 this turns out to be quite a problem for me.\nAdditionally, I thought I could get round it using FTP via Nautilus. This does work (a bit slower) but what happens is that if the file was changed over a year ago, then the file name is preceded by a space! Sounds odd, but I have looked carefully and the link seems to be the modified date. If the file has been changed this year, then the year is not given on the modified date and the file name is fine. If the file was change in 2013 or before then the year appears on the modified date and the file name has a space in front of it. Needless to say that this causes quite a few problems. However, this problem also happens in 13.10 (now that I try it). It is also true that FileZilla does not have this problem. I could use that, and although it is very good, it doesn't work quite as well as Nautilus does for a straight forward file manager.\nThoughts, comments or sympathy welcome. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I've recently had this issue. You can fix it by using the smb.conf file from a freshly installed 13.10 machine and put it in place of the one on the 14.04 machine under /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nHere's a link to the file you need on launchpad librarian\nAfter you do this, it's also a good idea to connect to the share via IP address instead of by computer name.\nHere's the entire script just in case:\n#\n# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.\n#\n#\n# This is the main Samba configuration file.

One broken, one not broken.\nCan I replace a HDD with a SSD? I noticed by using the smartctl command that my SSD is TWICE as fast! And my HDD is broken so I want to replace it with a SSD? But Im scared that they use different cables or the SSD wont fit into the laptop? Should I just be safe and by the same exact HDD that I had in the first place?\nMy plan was to buy another SSD (INTEL SSDSC2CW240A3) and replace the broken HDD (WDC WD10JPVT-55A1YT0)\n\n\nThis question --> I think about adding a second hard drive to my laptop is similar but doesnt seem solved :(\n\n\nEDIT: End game is clearly to install ubuntu on the new drive. I hope others are helped by this :) \n\nA: You already have a SATA 2.5\" SSD in the laptop, so it is highly likely you will be able to replace your disk drive with another SSD. Since you already have an SSD, you could just open the laptop and see if it fits. I expect it will. You do not even need to boot it, just check that it physically fits and the cables are ok.\nThe problem of fitting a hard drive to a laptop is that sizing of the drive bays varies between different models of laptop. There are five different 2.5\" hard drive form factors, each with the different heights  (5mm, 7mm, 9.5mm, 12.5mm, 15mm, see Hard disk drive form factors on Wikipedia) The internal bays of  laptops are designed only for a specific maximum height.\nThere are some other things to watch out for.\n\n\n*\n\n*Older laptops may only support PATA connectors, and modern SSDs are SATA.\n\n*You might not get the full speed from a SATA drive if you laptop does not support the latest SATA standard.\n\n*You might not have a regular 2.5\" hard drive bay. Some ultraportables use 1.8\" drives, some modern systems are using Mini-SATA cards, some are using PCIe SSDs, and soon some will be using M.2 cards.\n\n\nA: You can use a SSD instead of normal HDD as long as it has the same form factor 2.5 inches. The cabling is the same to all HDD. Nowadays most HDD use SATA cabling\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04LTS hangs when i change brightness of my display on Dell N5010 laptop I have dell n5010 \nmy system hang when I try to change brightness of the display and this happen only when my system on battery \nplease help how to solve this problem\n\nA: The Dell Inspiron N5010 (and other Dell laptops eg.

After the installation, I decided that i should partition my HDD so to have on the one partition the os and some other files (320 gb) and save to the other partition my video-edit works (320 gb). And I did so using the Ubuntu 14.04 live cd and gparted. I formatted the new disk part \"with\" ext4. But then something wird happened: While i am using ubuntu without any problem, i cannot edit the second partition, which means that i can't save or create something there! Ubuntu says that I am not the owner!! Why?? I need to solve this immediately! \nEDIT: Both of these two solutions below worked for me! However, faster way proved to be the one I have chosen!\n\nA: Because the partition was created outside your Ubuntu installation, it is owned by some other user, probably the super-user of the live cd. You can either reformat the partition inside Ubuntu and assign it to the current user or simply change read/write permissions so that the current user has access to that partition. This might also require giving the current user permissions to mount that partition.\n\nA: Type \n mount \n\nin terminal and find the partition which you want to change ownership\nmy output looks like \nif I want to change ownership of partition /dev/sd8 which is a ext4 partition and mounted on /media/bibi/films \nyou can also check ownership of mounted partitions with command\n ll /media/bibi\n\nas you can see my films folder is owned by root\n \nTo change the ownership I have to run\nsudo chown -R bibi:bibi /media/bibi/film\n\n\nyou have to substitute bibi with your user name\nIt is explained here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1137537\n", "Q: evolution plugin for exchange missing in 14.04 Just upgraded from 12.04 which evolution contained a plugin for MS Exchange.

Actually, I am using Ubuntu system and I want to install Windows. So which one is better? Installing Ubuntu before windows or windows before installing Ubuntu? Can you please clarify which method works? \n\nA: The solution is already pointed out, I just want to sum up everything:\nWhen running a dual boot environment, a boot loader has to show you the operating systems installed and let you select which one you want to boot. The Ubuntu boot loader, GRUB, is capable of doing this, while the one of Windows is not.\nTherefore, it is easier to first install Windows und Ubuntu afterwards. The Ubuntu installer will offer you to install Ubuntu beside Windows and will take care of everything. It's easy and the standard procedure.\nNevertheless, the other way round is possible, too. But the Windows bootloader will override GRUB. Because of that you'll have to reinstall GRUB. This can for example be achieved by booting a live system and running boot-repair. \n\nA: If you want to keep both in dual boot you should install first Windows then Ubuntu because if you do it reverse Windows boot loader with erase Grub boot loader and then you need to reinstall to get access to Ubuntu.\n\nA: First install Windows, then install Linux.\nLinux installation could overwrite windows bootloader in MBR (or could leave it untouched if you wish so), and Linux bootloader could boot both windows and linux.\n\nA: The bottom line, is that Windows is not known for \"playing well with others.\"  Therefore, it is typically easier to install Windows first, and then Ubuntu (Linux).  This way, GRUB will search for (and find) your Windows partition, and list it as a boot option on your GRUB menu.\nIf you install Ubuntu first and then Windows, the Windows boot loader will replace GRUB.  Additionally, it will not look for other operating systems to boot into (by design, perhaps?).  Regardless of how you choose to solve that (adding Ubuntu to the Windows boot loader, or replacing it with GRUB) you will have additional work to do by installing Windows last.\n", "Q: Where to configure which calendar is displayed by the default time & calendar indicator applet?

I am planning to implement EnhanceIO to use my new 25GB SSD drive for caching my 4TB RAID 0 array. The raid array is partitioned as: 500MB /boot, 20GB /, 200GB /vmware, and 3.4TB /home.\nI understand there are issues/complexity with caching root partitions, so I'm thinking of making a 500MB /boot partion on the SSD.\nMy question, will it make a difference putting /boot on the SSD? \nThis system is on 24/7, and really only gets rebooted once every few months. I'm thinking the kernel is the only thing getting loaded from the /boot partition, and it likely will stay entirely in memory. So having the /boot on SSD won't make any difference on a running system. Is my thinking correct?\n\nA: /boot is only used on booting the linux (or updating it's boot files). Caching it will not give any performance improvement if your computer is not rebooted.\nConsider using fast drive as swap partition\n", "Q: What is MASQUERADE in the context of iptables? In iptables many times I see the target  MASQUERADE. What is that? I searched and found lots of things.

I use it merely so share my internet with my android phones. \nFINAL EDIT: this link is the bestest http://gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=libalias\n\nA: MASQUERADE is an iptables target that can be used instead of SNAT target (source NAT) when external ip of the inet interface is not known at the moment of writing the rule (when server gets external ip dynamically).\n\nA: After study of above answers, this is what caused me to understand:\nMasquerading allows an entire network of internal IP addresses to operate through one external IP address and masquerading allows conversion from one protocol to another (wired/wireless).\nWhen the MASQUERADE chain sends a datagram from a computer it...\n\n*\n\n*Takes note of the type of datagram it is, \"TCP,\" \"UDP,\" \"ICMP,\" etc. Note: An unknown might not work correctly through MASQUERADE.\n\n*Modifies the datagram so that it looks like it was generated by the router machine itself (the one external address).\n\n*Remembers that it has done so, recording the local source and external destination IPs.\n\n*Transmits the datagram onto the Internet with the single external IP address.\n\nNote: When the destination host receives this datagram, it believes the datagram has come from the one routing host and sends any reply datagrams back to that address.\nWhen the Linux MASQUERADE chain receives a datagram from its Internet connection,\n\n*\n\n*It looks in its table of established masqueraded connections to see if this datagram actually belongs to a computer on the LAN.\n\n*If it does, it reverses the modification it did on the forward path and transmits the datagram to the LAN computer.\n\nThe MASQUERADE chain is useful for internally creating and entire private IP address space, and for forwarding packets that would otherwise be incompatible.\nThe Ethernet, or wired protocol, assumes that the packet comes from the source and reports itself. The Wifi, or wireless protocol, assumes that the packet is being repeated and reports itself and the original source.\nFor this reason, Wifi and Ethernet cannot be directly bridged because they are incompatible. Masquerading causes the packets to be rebuilt and will thereby handle conversion between wired and wireless standards. Note: There are ways to cause your computer to accept the incompatibility internally and bridge, but without a full masquerade, the bridge spoof will be viewed externally as a security risk and those requests will be rejected.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation on a hybrid HD with little SSD space I've just bought my ultrabook Lenovo Flex 14 8GbSSD 500HDD.

During installation, ensure you give the correct locations (eg /dev/sda5) and tell the installer NOT to format the partitions. After installation, edit your /etc/fstab file to put /var/log and /tmp on the HDD. There's plenty of help on this forum for this - it looks worse than it really is!\nI was in a similar situation with my Lenovo G510 and a hybrid disk drive which has 8GB SSD. It's a Seagate ST1000LM014-SSHD and as such the SSD part works as cache only. It needs no drivers and linux cannot even see it as a separate drive. See here. As your machine running a Seagate ST500LM000 it has the same technology as mine where they have their own internal implementation of caching. Apart from updating firmware, there is nothing else to worry about with them. Your drive details are here. \n", "Q: How can I extract user data from a file with awk and create a new user based on it?

Make sure that all of your VMs are set to Network Boot and are switched off. MAAS will power them on when needed (i.e. when Juju wants to deploy something to them).\nOne issue that you might be encountering is that Juju can timeout attempting to SSH to the nodes. You can configure the length of the timeout in your environments.yaml file.

My goal is to automatically mount a drive to /media/offsite and then kick off a .sh script to copy files around.  I have been reading many guides and have learned a lot, but I am still getting stuck.  Many of the guides are very outdated and apply to USB drives where as I have a docked drive.\nJust to see if a rule would trigger, I created this rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/80-external-disk.rules:\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"partition\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"5359-818E\", RUN+=\"/bin/mount -t exfat -U $env{ID_FS_UUID}\"\n\nI reloaded rules, rebooted server, few other things, and it appeared the rule wasn't firing.\nudevadm test $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sdb) 2>&1 | grep /etc/udev/rules.d\n\nThat only produces the following;\nparse_file: reading '/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules' as rules file\nparse_file: reading '/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules' as rules file\nparse_file: reading '/etc/udev/rules.d/80-external-disk.rules' as rules file\n\nMy thought is that the UUID belongs to the partition and not the drive.  With the partition being an exfat, can UDEV even see that UUID?\n\nA: mount is not allowed in the late releases of udev. Better to go with udisks if you are using Gnome/Unity or any other alternative for other DE.\nman udev\n\nRUN\nNote that running programs that access the network or mount/unmount\n  filesystems is not    allowed inside of udev rules, due to the default\n  sandbox that is enforced on    systemd-udevd.service.\n\n", "Q: Will installation of *BSD break my Ubuntu? And what about swap and bootloader mess up? I have Windows 8 on my hdd(with it's system and boot partition), an Extended partition(D under Windows) from which I extended 2 more partitions - the one for Ubuntu(which is primary) and one for swap.\nIf I extend some more space and use it to install *BSD there, will it mess up with Win/Ubuntu, can I use same swap partition for both Ubuntu and *BSD, and what will happen with the bootloader?\nCan I skip installing bootloader during installation on *BSD and will GRUB automatically find *BSD after it's installation?\n\nA: You cannot install BSD to the same partition as Ubuntu. It is possible to share swap partitions but you don't need to do so. This link covers some of that subject https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/61587/freebsd-and-linux-shared-partitions\nAs for an installation step for BSD skipping the installation of a bootloader varies from distro to distro. You should be able to skip the step if you are installing the debian version of BSD but I cannot speak for other distros. \nFinally, yes, grub will be able to find BSD after installation.

This link explains how to set it up: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/samba-fileserver.html. It works with both Windows and Linux clients, and there a ton of configuration possibilities (permissions, guest access, user-only editing permission, ...).\nIf you want to access this files remotely, one solution would be to configure a SSH server. I think that is the safest solution, once it uses encrypted keys to control the access. You can configure a special user to store the files, and configure it to be accessible through SSH connections. This way you avoid that system files to be accessible through these connections. And you can also use GUI interfaces to access it, like Nautilus, even if the server is command-line only.\n", "Q: Changing Ubuntu version So, my friend lent me his Ubuntu 12.10 boot CD, and it's the 64-bit version, but my processor is 32-bit.

We are using Ubuntu 10.04 and I am stuck on a lab problem. Here are the instructions:\n\nCreate a script called get_dirs that lists the directories in a directory, trims off any extra characters, and stores the data in a file called current_dirs. Run the script and verify the output. Make an alias for this command called gd. Check that the alias works then logout and log back in. Check to see if the alias is still valid\n\nIt is an online class and my instructor is currently unavailable. Up until this point in class I've been doing well but I can't figure out how to complete the directions in the first sentence.\n\nA: I would probably look for directories in the current working directory with something like find -maxdepth 1 -type d. This introduces some issues in that in adds ./ to the paths... Here's a demo:\n$ find -maxdepth 1 -type d\n.\n./sites\n./stories\n./templates\n./media\n\nI think that's what your instructions means by \"extra characters\". That's what it wants you to clean up so whatever you end up writing, from the above example, you'd end up with:\nsites\nstories\ntemplates\nmedia\n\nFor cleaning you'd want to look at tools like sed, grep and awk (any of those could do it and you should only need one)... You could even look at find's -exec or -fprint clauses but that's pretty advanced IMO.\nI think the rest is fairly self explanatory. Create a command that gets clean versions of the directory names, which saves its output in a file (see: bash redirection), check that it's right and then create a persistent bash alias for it.\nI say \"create a command\" above because I see no value in creating a standalone bash script for such a silly little command, especially if you're creating an alias later on...

It is the normal mode of operation for a multi-user Linux system.\nIf it is a shared account, (i.e. everyone logs in as something like \"GenericUser\") it is a bit more difficult. There are many ways it could be implemented, but most of them make more work to do and more things that can break. This adds work for the University technical support staff to keep up with, something they probably have too much of already.\nThe best way might be to have the /home/$user filesystem of that shared/default user load as a ramfs/tmpfs. Students can make all the changes they want, but when the account is logged out all changes are lost. Next time the account logs in, the filesystem is loaded from the disk into the ramfs/tmpfs again with none of the changes.\n", "Q: Automatically being logged out in Lubuntu (openbox) I get automatically logged-out every now and then of my PC.\nI use Lubuntu 14.04, which has openbox, LXDE. I didn't installed neither openbox nor LXDE by myself.\nIt happens when I turn-off the wifi, but also at other times.\nI am not sure if it's a log-out or just something like Xorg crashing and being re-started.\nHow can I diagnose and repair this problem?\nWould this solution work and what consequences would it have?\nFrom My ubuntu randomly automatically logout after installing openbox: \n$ sudo apt-get remove apport update-manager update-manager-core\n\n\nA: Some packages listed in that command (update-manager and update-manager-core) would remove your ability to update packages on your system, and that is definitely NOT recommended, so that solution would not work.\nIn my experience, generally if you can run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade from a terminal, you might solve the problem. This command downloads the newest versions of packages on your system and installs them, possibly fixing bugs such as this.\n\nA: Most likely Xorg is crashing on you and upstart relaunches the display manager which results in you being presented with a logon screen.\nCheck your Xorg log files they are /var/log/Xorg.0.log for the current session and /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old for the previous session. You will need to look into the .old file.\nIf you want to get really technical (as in C level system calls) you can switch to a text console, log on, sudo su, strace -o /root/trc -ff -p 1 and then switch back to the GUI. When you get logged off switch back to the text console, interrupt strace with Ctrl-C and examine files /root/trc.*. Your answer may be somewhere there but the signal to noise ratio is fairly low.\n\nA: I have been getting logged out of Ubuntu as well. How I fixed it was, go into system settings, click on brightness and lock,set the timer to turn off screen when inactive to never. Then set the turn off lock screen to 1 hour or shut it off.\nThat solved my problem.Was getting logged out every 30 min.

I have 4 hard drives, two identical drives with 750mb capacity used in RAID 0, one 2TB drive, and a 500MB drive, which contains my Windows 7 installation. The latter is partitioned to hold a 300MN NTFS partition for the Win7, and I created a 170mb ext4 partition with \"\\\" as mount point, and the rest (some 7gb or so) as a swap partition. The Kubuntu would go on the ext4, but as mentioned above, it crashes at the end of the install. However, when I try to boot my PC, I get a GRUB> prompt, so the win7 loader is replaced (I can repair it, that's no issue).\nAt the beginning of the installation the installer asks me if I wanted to download updates during the installation, and 3rd party stuff, but I didn't check in these, because when I do check them in, the installer hangs at the point of configuring some kind of broadcom driver (I have a wireless PCI card in the PC, I guess that causes tis other problem).\nHope I was detailed enough, does anyone have a suggestion for solving this problem?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try booting from your install media, using the try Ubuntu option.  Once Ubuntu is running, install \"boot-repair\".  It is a small GUI interface, run from the command line with \"boot-repair\" command.\nThe utility program has options for EFI or Boot.  It should repair your Win7 bootloader.  Also, once you manage to get Ubuntu up and running.  You may want to run the boot-repair utility before re-booting to make sure Grub has been re-installed correctly for the new install.  This was the only way I could get my dual boot issues resolved.\nTo install boot-repair, you must be booted into Ubuntu, grab the terminal emulator of choice:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-  trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nsudo boot-repair\n\nOnce the install is finished the last command line launches the program.  Just follow the prompts and you should be OK.\nHope this will solve your issue. \n", "Q: Upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 without losing all files? I want to upgrade Ubuntu and keep my existing files and apps. Is there a way to upgrade from Ubuntu 13.10 to Ubuntu 14.04 without having to download an ISO, put it on a USB and then install it and have it erase all my files and apps?\n\nA: Ubuntu has already answered this question on their very own site.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade\n\nA: sudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\n\nA: Yes you can. You should check in the Software & Updates on the Updates tab for what versions you get update notifications. The other way is to download the ISO and make a bootable CD or USB dongle. When you boot the live CD and start the installation, you should be given the option to upgrade 13.10 to the 14.04 without erasing our files and apps.\n", "Q: Add space to partition I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server vm with esxi.  I added an additional 20 GB to my thick provisioned lazy zero disk, but I'm not able to resize my current partition.  I am booting from a gparted live iso. I would like to merge /dev/sda1 and unallocated, but I do not seem to get the option.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on increasing the size of /dev/sda1?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to merge unallocated space with /dev/sda1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu live disk or gparted live disk.\n\n*Note that your unallocated space is just outside of your extended partition. Open gparted partition editor, right-click on the extended partition(/dev/sda2) and select Resize/Move option.\n\n*Move the right-arrow to  extreme right, so that the  unallocated space will comes under your extended partition(just below to your swap partition).\n\n*Now right-click on your swap partition and select Resize/Move option. Move the dragger to the extreme right, so that the unallocated space would come before to your swap partition(just above to your swap).\n\n*After that, you can be able to get out of the unallocated space from that extended partition by right-clicking on the extended partition(/dev/sda2) and selecting Resize/Move option. Then shrink it's space, so that the unallocated space present inside your extended partition will get out of that.\n\n*After doing the above step, now your unallocated space would come just above to your /dev/sda2 extended partition.\n\n*Finally, now you can be able to resize(increase the space of) your /dev/sda1 partition.\nNOTE: Make sure that all the partitions are unmounted before doing the above operations.\n\nA: You can't merge a primary partition with an extended partition. \nIf you want to do it, you will need to first move the swap to the end of the extended partition (sda2) - actually, just delete it, and recreate it at the end at some point.\nSo, delete the extended partition (sda2); then, you should be able to expand the primary partition.\nThen create a swap file at the at the end of the disk.\nIt would have been best to create one big extended partition at the beginning, then create logical drives in that partition for everything.  But you are OK as long as you don't want to try to create more than 4 partitions, which is the limit of primary partitions.\nEDIT:  I forgot one thing.  If you delete the swap file, you will need to update the file /etc/fstab because there will be a new UUID.  If you want to do that, you can run blkid to get the UUID, and paste that into fstab:\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null is the best way to invoke it to get the correct UUID\nBut really, you don't want to do that; you should just move the swap file/extended partition to the end of the unused space. After doing that, you can grow the primary partition.\n\nA: You are unable to add it because it's a logical partition of an extended partition. You could however delete the extended partition, expand the primary partition as desired, and then create a new swap partition afterwards.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up Ubuntu.\n\n*In terminal type sudo apt-get install gparted.\n\n*Open Gparted. You can do so from your applications screen.\n\n*Choose your device from the devices menu on the far right.\n\n*Right click on the swap partition and choose \"swapoff\".\n\n*Right click on the swap partition (sda5), and choose \"delete\". Right click on the extended partition (sda2), and choose \"delete\".\n\n*Click the green checkmark on the top menu to apply these changes.\n\n*Right click on the primary partition (sda1), and choose \"resize/move\". Add the amount of space you want to it, but make sure to leave some for swap.\n\n*Click the green checkmark on the top menu to apply these changes.\n\n*Right click on the unallocated space, and click \"new\".\n\n*Choose \"linux-swap\" as the filesystem type, and click \"add\".\n\n*Click the green checkmark on the top menu to apply these changes, and then close Gparted.\n\n*Right click on the swap partition, choose \"swapon\", and close Gparted.\n\n*In terminal type sudo blkid, and copy the UUID for your swap partition.\n\n*In terminal type gksu gedit /etc/fstab, and change the UUID of the swap entry to match your current one. Then change the sda# to sda2 in the swap location comment line. Save your changes, and close Gedit. [If you don't have \"Gksu\" installed you can use sudo gedit /etc/fstab instead.]\n\n*Reboot.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*When resizing a partition that Ubuntu is running on you will be able to expand, but not shrink. You can get around this by partitioning from a livecd instead which is often considered better practice, but the fstab editing must be done within Ubuntu.\n\n*You can verify your swap is recognized by checking your System Monitor. It will have an entry for SWAP, and list the amount used (if any) along with the total available.\n\n*Tested May 15 2014 10:02 PM on Ubuntu 14.04 - Desktop X86-64\n", "Q: Ubuntu File System Partition gone Unallocated I decided to install Windows 7 next to my Ubuntu setup and started to follow this instructions. Currently i'm on the third step. But when i try to mount the file system that i noted down, it says \"mount: special device /dev/sda6/ does not exist\". Here is a picture of the current partitions. Since the instructions says that i need to note down the partition name, can i assume that i can still get back what was on my Ubuntu file system?\nIs it possible to make unallocated partition in the image, functional again? Did my whole Ubuntu installation got wiped out? Should i try using testdisk to get back the unallocated partition?\n\nA: It looks like you (or a bug) have accidentally deleted your Ubuntu partition. To get it back, I recommend using TestDisk. This isn't 100% guaranteed to work, but there's a good chance it will. The odds of success go way down if you created that NTFS partition in a location that used to hold the Linux partition. If that's the case, your best bet of any sort of recovery is to use PhotoRec to recover individual files. That will be tedious, and there's a good chance that some files will be completely lost.\nWhatever you do, write nothing to that disk until you've recovered it! Note that booting a modern OS invariably writes files to its boot partition, and sometimes elsewhere, so this means you should not boot Windows!

Until now, I have not observed any problems resulting from the procedure. Is the procedure OK generally? (I use it with a particular old hardware that is not certified for Ubuntu.)\n\nA: It would be better to press ctrl+alt+F1, F2, ..., or F6, then end the program from the terminal, using top or htop (if installed). \nIf you still can do some things with the GUI, you can open gnome-system-monitor, and kill the problem program/service.

You can change the default gcc version by using the update-alternatives command to determine which actual file is referenced by a generic name, for example which actual file is referenced by gcc. For more information see the answers to this question: How to change the default GCC compiler in Ubuntu?.\n\nA: To call gcc 4.9 specifically, use gcc-4.9 at the command prompt.\nAll the gcc versions you have installed can be called individually by adding a hyphen and the version number at the end of gcc.  In your case, gcc-4.8 and gcc-4.9 should be available. In a terminal, type gcc- (note the hyphen) and the push tab twice to see if there are any other versions installed.\nNote that the default gcc is likely still 4.8.  (Use gcc -v to verify this.)

The base package (gcc-4.9-base) and the GCC Go 4.9 compiler (gccgo-4.9) are available, but the other frontends are not. I don't know why.\n\nA: The best way to correctly install gcc-4.9 and set it as your default gcc version use:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9\n\nThe --slave, with g++, will cause g++ to be switched along with gcc, to the same version. But, at this point gcc-4.9 will be your only version configured in update-alternatives, so add 4.8 to update-alternatives, so there actually is an alternative, by using:\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8\n\nThen you can check which one that is set, and change back and forth using:\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\n\nIf you have an issue with update-alternatives gcc priority 60 not being higher than previous versions installed you can use the previous update-alternatives --config gcc command to check installed versions and use:\nsudo update-alternatives --remove gcc\n\nOr:\nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc\n\nNOTE: You could skip installing the PPA Repository and just use /usr/bin/gcc-4.9-base but I prefer using the fresh updated toolchains.\n\nFor GCC 5.X or 6, the packages (and correspondingly, the commands) are just called gcc-5, gcc-6, etc. This is due to the change in GCC's version scheme, where 5.1 is the first GCC 5 release, and future 5.X releases are for bug fixes.\n", "Q: How do I change the locale of Wine to Japanese on Ubuntu 14.04?

A friend installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my laptop a few months ago. It's been working great up until about thirty minutes ago. \nI booted up the system tonight after having shut it down this morning before work. Upon startup my mouse/cursor is missing, my internet connection is disabled (despite the wireless adapter being switched on and the internet connection working fine on other devices in the house). I am able to use the keyboard and access the terminal, but I don't know the first thing about fixing this issue.\nI tried searching the Ubuntu forums and Ask Ubuntu, but I don't see any issues that mimic mine. I also, unfortunately, am unable to offer any sort of system data because I can't access the internet or use the mouse on my laptop to even obtain such data. \nI really need help. I can't even begin to speculate how this happened considering everything was working fine at 8 a.m. this morning. \n\nA: I sometimes have similar issue with the cursor. Touchpad gets disabled sometimes. Did you check that. In my laptop, Fn+F3 key combination toggles touchpad on and off. There's a wifi on/off key combination too, which is Fn+F2 in my laptop. \n\nA: I had the same problem and I found out what happened, I had to stop apt-get while installing wine, and ever since that happened everything started, anyways I just purged wine (you'll maybe need to purge some other pckg) from the terminal using aptitude and everything came back to normal  try doing the same ;)\nOh and to solve the pointer problem so it's easier to fix this try this command:\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\n", "Q: How to disable password prompt for switching users in graphical session? In 14.04, how can I switch between users on the console without entering a password?  This has been asked by others many times over the years (such as here), and it seems it always gets redirected to something else that's close but not the same.  So, I'll try to be exact in the use case below, to avoid any misunderstandings of the goal.  Sorry for the length.\n\n\n*\n\n*The sole reason for switching between users is so family members at our home can have their own browser favorites/history, their own unity session prefs (I use dvorak and swap esc/capslck), etc.  We use a BIOS password to prevent routine machine access; security amongst ourselves is not a concern.  We don't use any drive or mount point encryption, so I've no illusions of protection after physical theft.\n\n*I do want a password on my account, so I can authenticate for system updates, authenticate with sudo for various activities, scp between various machines, etc.\n\n*I would prefer to be prompted for a password if I'm not already logged into the console, but not again when just switching from other users.  If I'd ever feel the need for a session lock, I could live with just logging out instead, though it's not preferable.\n\n*An ubuntuforums hack for 12.04 of uninstalling gnome-screensaver worked well for that old release, but doesn't work under 14.04.\n\n*Setting disable-lock-screen (per a couple ways here) also doesn't work.\n\n*Settings|Brightness|Lock=OFF doesn't help\n\n*Because this is important for us, I'm willing to try other flavors (lubuntu, xubuntu) or even other distros to get this functionality, but prefer unity from the main ubuntu distro.\nFollowing the idea here, I'm currently test driving password-less standard accounts, and using password-protected administrator account (not root) for software updates, scp commands, etc.  This mostly accomplishes the goal, and (since I'm old-school) it feels right to use a dedicated admin acct for admin-ish things, but I'd still like the option to lock my session.\n(If this is a missing feature, I'm thinking launchpad is the best avenue for submitting a feature request; correct me if I'm wrong.)\n\nA: add user\nsudo adduser -m -s /bin/bash \n\n-m means add home directory, -s means the following is their login shell\nremove user password\nsudo passwd -d USERNAME\n\nnow to allow passwordless logins you need to edit a text file\npico /etc/pam.d/common-auth \n\nOR \ngedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth \n\nAND REPLACE THE LINE\n\n\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure\n\n\nWITH\n\n\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok\n\n\n.\n.\n.\nTo revert your change simply re-add \"_secure\" at the end. Or just make a backup of the original file\ncp /etc/pam.d/common-auth /etc/pam.d/common-auth.BACKUP\n\nI believe the main reason *nixers are so obnoxious about passwords is actually to protect network data moreso than physical drive data. That said there is a time and place for EVERYTHING. imo.

Looking at converting from Windows XP to Ubuntu.  Need to know if Ubuntu can open and update Microsoft Word files.\n\nA: To be frank there's a lot of issues with .doc and .docx formats in LibreOffice. If your MS Office files are simple text files, it won't give you trouble. But if it contains images, specially the .docx files, you might have a frustrating experience with LibreOffice.\nYou can do all the things in LibreOffice that you do in MS Office. But first thing is you need to get rid of doc/docx file formats. Open Document Tex (.odt) is the default file format in LibreOffice and it is great. It even works with MS Office.\nHowever, if you want to stick to the doc/docx file format, you can even install MS Office in ubuntu. There's a provision for that. \n\nA: Apache Open Office, and LibreOffice are both freely available for Ubuntu. While they do support editing/creating word documents in .doc and .docx formats their support isn't 100%. If you want to test them out first to see if this will affect you both Apache Open Office, and LibreOffice are also available for Windows. Another option would be to try running Microsoft Office in Wine. Wine is a program that attempts to act a compatibility layer so that you can run Windows programs on Linux operating systems. Some programs work, some sort of work, and some don't work at all. I've never tried Office in Wine so I don't know if it works.\nLibreOffice: http://www.libreoffice.org/\nLibreOffice Direct Download Link (An Official Mirror): http://tdf.mirror.rafal.ca/libreoffice/stable/4.2.4/win/x86/LibreOffice_4.2.4_Win_x86.msi\nApache Open Office = https://www.openoffice.org/\nApache Open Office Direct Download Link (An Official Mirror): http://softlayer-dal.dl.sourceforge.net/project/openofficeorg.mirror/4.1.0/binaries/en-US/Apache_OpenOffice_4.1.0_Win_x86_install_en-US.exe\n\nA: Yes it can, Ubuntu comes with Libreoffice writer installed it can open ms word files and can save them to ms word document format it supports .doc and also .docx format. Libreoffice is freeware and preinstalled so no need to install it.\n\nA: I almost never use Microsoft Word these days as Google Docs (free if you have a Gmail account) works simply and straightforwardly in the browser on Windows, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and even on tablet devices. The other advantage your data is stored in the Cloud and therefore automatically backed up and available from wherever you need it.\nIf you go down this route I would recommend you download and install the Chrome browser in place of the default Firefox to get the most out of the features.\nLibreOffice though is definitely a competent alternative Microsoft Word, and as noted is installed as standard in Ubuntu. \nWhilst the use of open file formats is to commended you may find Windows / Word stalwarts (especially ones running older versions) complaining when they receive files with unusual extensions! \n\nA: As already mentioned, as long as the .doc/.docx files are simple structured you won't have big issues. That changes with the complexity of the .dox/.docx files. A further headache is the collaboration with other users who use MS-Word only on their Windows or Apple machine or even work with customers. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Go to Switch Account without goint through Lock Account Okay. So the new Ubuntu 14.04 decided that user needs to lock their account first then, switch account. So my question is How can I go straight to Switch Account screen without going through the Lock screen. I feel this part is backward and really annoying, especially on a shared computer.\n\nA: I imagine the idea might be that if you know which user-id you want to sign onto you would select it immediately from the menu rather than using \"Lock/Switch Account\".\nWith that covered the expectation might be if you select Lock/Switch Account you want to sign on later with another id but are ready to put aside and safeguard the privacy of your current work now.\nIrregardless, you can choose the Lock/Switch Account option and then, without unlocking your account, select Switch Account from the corresponding menu from the Lock Screen. \nYou simply skip unlocking your old session.\n", "Q: What's the difference between the TTY and the GNOME terminal? I know that terminal can be started by Ctrl+Alt+T. But sometime users say about command-line with Ctrl+Alt+F2.\nSo, Is there any difference in working between them? And when should I use between them?\nWhat is called tty? \n\nA: The virtual terminals (the ones you get to with Ctrl Alt F1-9) go back to the roots of Linux. Remember that Linux was originally a command-line only system and designed for multiple users. The idea was that each user could log into a single tty. This would not happen on the same physical machine of course, think of servers that many computer terminals would connect to. Each user would connect using a different computer and the server would log them into a tty.\nThis has nothing to do with the tty command which is part of coreutils. The tty command is simply a tool that lets you know the name of the terminal you are currently using.\nThe \"terminal\" (actually called a \"terminal emulator\") is simply a GUI program that mimics the old behavior. It lets you run a shell (bash in the default Ubuntu) from within your X session.\nThe main point is that both the virtual terminals and the terminal emulators provide you with a command line interface, a shell. They are basically the same thing. The only important difference from a practical point of view is that the terminal emulators run interactive, non-login shells while if you drop into a tty and login there, you will run an interactive, login shell. For more information on the differences between these two types of shell, see here.\nI suggest you also read this excellent Q&A on Unix & Linux:\nWhat is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'?.\n", "Q: Can HomeBank 4.5.6 be used to supersede 4.5.5 in the Ubuntu repository please? I don't know which version I used to use successfully, but I used to import QIF files from my bank into HomeBank. My computer was out of action for a couple of months, and when I got it working again I attempted to continue importing QIF files into HomeBank again (version 4.5.5 now). It didn't work, I reported a bug, I have been informed that the bug has been fixed in the next version (4.5.6) of the application on or around 16 February 2014.\nI can't use the application if it can't import these files, and now it has been 3 months since it was apparently fixed. \n\nA: The latest version for Ubuntu can be installed with:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mdoyen/homebank\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install homebank\n\nThe newest version source code can be found on launchpad. Latest stable is 4.5.6 (direct download). The download has an installation script. Relevant part:\nThe simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n ./configure to configure the package for your system.\nRunning configure might take a while.  While running, it prints\n some messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n*Type make to compile the package.\n\n*Optionally, type make check to run any self-tests that come with\n the package.\n\n*Type make install to install the programs and any data files and\n documentation.\n\n*You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n source code directory by typing make clean'.  To also remove the\n files thatconfigurecreated (so you can compile the package for\n a different kind of computer), typemake distclean.  There is\n also amake maintainer-clean` target, but that is intended mainly\n for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n with the distribution.\n\n*Often, you can also type make uninstall to remove the installed\n files again.\n", "Q: Why is the minimum video memory for a virtualbox machine so large? I'm creating many virtualbox systems with clean installs and such and noticed that the default video memory size is quite large. I could understand at the beginning of the Ubuntu installation a VGA screen is used. I'm not too sure of the dimensions and color depth used, but I would imagine that's quite small. (0.5Mb?)\nThen I end up using those systems in plain console mode.\nWhat would be the minimum required to run that? Can't I just put 1Mb and be good with it and save some memory when running those vitualbox systems?\n\nA: Simple Answer: Yes.\nIf you experience lag just adjust it. Even though I use just the console I adjust it to way more than 1MB just because im always flying all over the place.\nThe default recommended video memory for SERVERS on VB is ~9MB\n", "Q: Is there any difference between run command in terminal & ALT+F2 For running direct commands, there are two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Either run in Terminal\n\n*Or run from the \"Run Command\" dialogue (screen shown below) obtained from Alt+F2\n\nThen, Is there any difference between them? (working same & shell) or redirects to same?\n\nA: Yes! I originally said no because the differences are relatively none imo since the same binaries process the command in the end. That said CTRL+ALT+F# and the Quick-Run cmd are different virtual terminals so there are bound to be small differences, like the .bashrc file wont be loaded for Quick-run commands. So alias commands that you have set up wont work and such.\n\nA: I don't think there is any difference between the two it's just that once you run a command using Alt + F2 the dash closes before you see the results / output. But it is used according to different purpose as following.\nUse Alt + F2 when running commands that expected no output or that open an external application. Example: gksu nautilus which opens up a root nautilus window.\nFor commands that expected an output - ls,rm, find, update, upgrade, install, etc then recommended to use the terminal.\n\nA: I would think yes. I never use the Alt-F2.\nIf you write a small shell script, you should see the difference in the environment if any:\n#!/bin/sh\nset\n\nI'm not too sure where the output goes in case of Alt-F2. If needed, redriect to a file:\n#!/bin/sh\nset >/tmp/set.txt\n\nOther than that, I would imagine that it is pretty close. Obviously, stdin and stdout may not be connected to a TTY when using the Alt-F2 and the application is not attached to anything, meaning that it is similar to running it in a console with the &.\nIn your console:\n$ my-app &\n\n(the $ represents the prompt)\n", "Q: Can you use gnome keyring in bash script, if yes then how?

For displaying message and print data there are two command available printf and echo.\nThen how differently they used? Which is more preferable?\n\nA: Preferable and most widely used is not the same thing. While printf is better for many reasons, most people still use echo because the syntax is simpler. \nThe main reasons why you should prefer printf are:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo is not standardized, it will behave differently on different systems.\n\n*It is hard to predict what you're actually running when you echo foo. To illustrate, on my Debian system:\n$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n\nAs you can see, there are two different echo commands, one is a shell (bash in this case) builtin and another is a separate binary. Note that bash also has a printf builtin but its behavior is more standardized so it is less of an issue (thanks to @  RaduRădeanu for pointing it out).\n\n*Since some (but not all) implementations of echo support command line switches, it is hard to print a string that starts with a -. While many programs support -- to signify the end of switches and the beginning of arguments (for example, grep -- -a file will find lines in file that contain -a), echo does not. So, how do you have echo print -n?\n$ echo -n           ## no output\n$ echo '-n'         ## no output\n$ echo \"-n\"         ## no output\n$ echo \\-n          ## no output\n$ echo -e '\\055n'   ## using the ASCII code works but only on implementations\n-n                  ## that support -e\n\nprintf can do this easily:\n$ printf -- '-n\\n'\n-n\n$ printf '%s\\n' -n\n-n\n$ printf '\\055n\\n' \n-n\n\nFor more information than you ever wanted to know on why printf is better than echo, see this answer to a similar question on http://unix.stackexchange.com:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/65819/22222\n\nA: To ask which is preferable is itself incomplete.  \nIf all one wishes to do is emit one or more lines of text terminated by newlines, then echo suffices.  If anything more clever is intended, specifically including a \"partial line\" that does not have the newline, then printf is best for that purpose.\n", "Q: How to use Soundcloud in tor-browser? it need flash-player! I am in Iran and have to use tor-browser in my Ubuntu 14.04.\nBut it has a problem with flash-player in \"Soundcloud\". I installed many flash-player add-ons on it. but it not helped me and site say to me that need flash-player to play musics. thanks.\n\nA: You are not supposed to use flash with tor. It ruins the whole point of using tor. However, if you still want to use it I'll suggest chrome with this command:\nchromium-browser --proxy-server=\"socks://127.0.0.1:9050\" --incognito check.torproject.org\n\nIf doesn't work do:\nkillall chromium-browser\n\nThen try again\nYou must run tor first by\ntor&\n\nI assumed that tor and chromium-browser is installed on your system. If not install them from software center. However, I forgot to mention one thing. You need to find out at which port tor is listening to. To do that, simply run this command:\ntor\n\nwithout the \"&\" sign. It will give a output in terminal. Look for this in the output:\n[notice] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050\nThose digits might be different on your system. Put that thing in the previous chromium-browser command.\n\nA: Flash-Player is very insecure and very dangerous technology. Malicious executable code (like viruses and spyware) can be hidden inside it. That's why Google is planning of deactivating it by default in future Chrome/Chromium versions.\nI love SoundCloud too, but i have Flash-Player more, that's why i stopped using Soundcloud. At least until they replace Flash with something else.  \nAllowing Flash to run on your PC is equivalent to letting spyware into your computer, and that defeats the whole purpose of Tor.

I have been told that CentOS uses almost the same commands with ubuntu as it is considered one of linux based system.

I have a wired ADSL connection with a modem-cum-router. I generally connect to the internet using PPPoE i.e. the router itself establishes the connection with my ISP as soon as I switch it on. And the router being connected to my PC using ethernet cable provides the internet to it without any further configuration in Ubuntu.\nHowever, yesterday I was facing some issues with the router so I switched it to the DSL (Bridging) mode. This setup requires me to use sudo pppoeconf to let Ubuntu know my ISP username and password so that it can make the connection with ISP. The internet was fine during the session after making the changes.\nBut, after a reboot, Ubuntu can't access the internet anymore. So, I once again switched my router to PPPoE mode and the internet works fine on my dual-boot Windows 7 but not on Ubuntu. Even after making this change (i.e. reverting to the situation which was working all along) I am not able to access the internet using Ubuntu. However, I can see that I have been allotted the IPv4 address by my ISP.\nFollowing are some of the troubleshooting steps (while in PPPoE mode), that I took:\n$ ifconfig\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 94:de:80:34:47:7b\n          inet6 addr: fe80::96de:80ff:fe34:477b/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:33 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000\n          RX bytes:78 (78.0 B)  TX bytes:4642 (4.6 KB)\n          Interrupt:18\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:107 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:107 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:7923 (7.9 KB)  TX bytes:7923 (7.9 KB)\n\n$ route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n\n$ ping -c 1 www.google.com\nping: unknown host www.google.com\n\nThen, I tried to once again run sudo pppoeconf, which gave me the following output (I have tried this in both PPPoE as well as Bridging modes):\n\nSeeing that the output of route was nothing, I ran:\n$ sudo route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0\n\n$ route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0\n\nBut this didn't help much.\n$ ping -c 1 www.google.com\nping: unknown host www.google.com\n\n$ ping -c 1 8.8.8.8\nconnect: Network is unreachable\n\n$ dig @8.8.8.8    \n; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-3-Ubuntu <<>> @8.8.8.8\n; (1 server found)\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\nThe nameservers seem to be fine to me:\n$ cat /etc/resolv.conf\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\n$ cat /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nI tried to access my modem configuration page on 192.168.1.1, but I wasn't able to connect to it.

Using sudo dhclient -d -v -nw eth0 should allow you to know who's the culprit. If it works, then Network Manager configuration is messed up and you need to repair it. If it doesn't then you need to review your router configuration, in which case the router manual is necessary.\nOne way to fix network manager, just open the configuration interface in \"Network Settings\", select the desired network (lets say Wired), look for the cog button, and fix the configuration selecting \"automatic\". \nThere's also a select option, where you can select \"Reset\" (do NOT use \"Forget) and it will restore the defaults.\nOf course, network manager won't configure your devices if you have them configured in your /etc/networking/interfaces. Just delete/comment out those lines, then try again.\nThese options assumes you are using a GNOME-like environment, other environment can have similar options.\n\nA: I solved it by editing the file /etc/network/interfaces.conf\nI left only these two lines:\n# Interfaces (5) file used by ifup (8) and ifdown (8)\nauto io\niface io inet loopback\n\nThen I restarted Ubuntu.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 + gnome 3.10 + gnome-shell restart Is there a way to ask gnome-shell to run a shell script every time it starts? \n(Like after a Alt+F2 then r, not on Login)\nNB: If you think it's about the start-up list, it's not : do a Alt+F2 then r and tell me if the apps in start-up list are launched: They're not (at least not on my setup).\nUnfortunately, through a shell script it's not working yet :\n#!/bin/bash\n gnome-shell --replace\n sleep 10\n## reset screen config\n xrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output VIRTUAL1 --off --output DP1 --off --output eDP1 --off --output VGA1 --off\n\n## reset keyboard\nsetxkbmap fr\n\nthe xrandr command is working as expected on startup\nif i type in terminal sh rgnome.sh, gnome is restarted, but the next commands don't seem to get executed (and if i close the terminal it kills gnome); i'm not versed in shell scripting, so i may be doing something obvious very wrong\n\nA: You can create a shell script available within your path, maybe call it r.sh.\nThat script should call the gnome-shell --replace command, and then the commands you use to fix your display config.\nYou might need to wait a couple of seconds before running those commands in order to wait for the replace to succeed.\nEDIT:\nThe script might be something along the lines of this:\n#!/bin/bash\ngnome-shell --replace\nsleep 2\nfix-your-display-commands\n\n\nA: Your shell script does not work because the xrandr command is waiting for the gnome-shell --restart to exit. Since that does not happen while gnome is running, the xrandr command is not executed. You need to tell your script to run it in the background, that way the subsequent commands will also be run:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## Start gnome-shell in the background.

On my laptop trying to go in sleep mode using the Unity Sleep item (or closing the lid for what it is worth) does not work well (it goes in suspend mode very slowly and after that I am unable to wake the laptop correctly).\nWhen I use a simple sudo pm-suspend everything is working fine and quick.\nI thus would like to know exactly what actions are done by Unity when trying to go in sleep mode.\nJust for the sake of information I currently use Ubuntu 14.04 on a MacBookPro10,1 (first retina edition) using the integrated graphics card (discrete one, which is an nvidia, is powered off so that suspend and brightness control may be usable) and after booting directly using EFI (using rEFInd and linux kernel efistub).\n\nA: systemd-logind manages user sessions in 14.04 (replacing consolekit and upower with login1), the command to used by the system menu to suspend the system is: \ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend\" boolean:true\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04 onto external HDD I'm having problems with installing Ubuntu 14.04 onto my Verbatim 1TB external drive.\nI tried all kinds of tutorials, partitioning but nothing seems to work.

This is kind of foolproof.\n(Just wondering: why are you installing a system on an external drive (I suppose, USB connected), which has a bandwith of 10Mb/s instead of 100-500Mb/s in case of internal HDD. This is not a good ideea!)\n\nA: I got 14.04 installed to my external usb3 drive. \nInstalled from a usb3 key. \nBoots using UEFI\nAt the \"How do you want to install uduntu\" window.\nSelect something else.\nFor boot system files\nSelect your external drive in the drop down box near the bottom. \nMAKE SURE THE EXTERNAL DRIVE IS SELECTED\nClick the plus.\nI made a 1gig UEFI partition at the begging\n4096 swap space at end of the drive\nThe rest /\nClick continue.\nLet it do its thing.\n\nA: You should make sure you have the right version of Ubuntu (i386 for 32-bit machines and amd64 for 64-bit) installed. If you have the wrong version you will not be able to boot your system.\nAlso, some external hard drives do not boot very well, because sometimes the system only detects the SATA to USB adapter and not the drive, making it not able to find what to boot. This is less of a problem with ESATA drives because they don't need to adapt to another standard, so the system will generally detect them as just the hard drive and not an adapter.  \nYou should also make sure that when installing GRUB you installed it to the external hard drive and not the internal one.\n", "Q: Preseeding does not work properly in Ubuntu 14.04 We use the preseed method to automate the installation process since Ubuntu 10.04. In particular, we use the pkgsel/include parameter to preinstall a set of packages. Up to Ubuntu 12.04 everything worked fine. For the old versions, we used the alternate installer.\nNow we try to migrate to Ubuntu 14.04. Since there is no alternate installer anymore, we use the standard installer. In principle the installer recognizes the preseed file. For example, it correctly extracts the partition layout, sets the correct root password and mirror. \nHowever, it ignores the pkgsel/include option. It just installs the standard set of packages. Moreover, it ignores the hostname obtained from dhcp.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: My suggestion would be to use the server ISO with a preseed file. It seems to behave better with preseeding, but it also allows you to set up a mirror and install any packages you need from the servers. I'm using a similar setup with Packer along a very similar manner to this post. http://kappataumu.com/articles/creating-an-Ubuntu-VM-with-packer.html\nAs you mentioned the desktop installer for 14.04 changed and now most d-i options need to be converted to ubiquity syntax (the server ISO still uses debian installer aka d-i).\nThe downside is that there is NOT a ubiquity/pkgsel command, but what you can do is use preseed/late_command somescript.sh and then run some in-target apt-get install openssh-server commands within that script.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbiquityAutomation\nThere are also some files for Ubuntu Desktop provided by a gentleman on the official Packer Google group.\nhttp://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/packer-tool/SWhoARVwVnM\nI would also suggest checking out the Ubuntu repository on Github under boxcutter, they have some excellent working preseed files for each version of Ubuntu. https://github.com/boxcutter/ubuntu\n\nA: Lubuntu still has alternate install images,\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/14.04/release/\nDepending on what you need, you might be able avoid your problem with ubiquity,\nthe standard graphical installer\nby using this alternate install image and customizing the install to your needs,\nas you have been doing for older releases.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Stays on Desktop BackGround Picture When I turn my PC on it works until bacground picture comes.\nBut than nothing comes.\nNo desktop icons,\nno upper line settings,\nno left short-cut icons.

At present, the noobslab PPA does not include the dependency ps3mediaserver-multiarch (see comments in link above).\nHopefully that will get fixed soon and then you should be able to install ps3mediaserver from the noobslab/apps PPA in Ubuntu 14.04 using the simple commands in the article linked above.\nIn the meantime, you can do the following to work around the issue.\nFirst, add the noobslab ppa and update packages:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, add the happy-neko PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:happy-neko/ps3mediaserver\n\nHappy-Neko doesn't offer anything for trusty currently, so no point in updating. Now you will edit the PPA you just added in order to gain access to the most recent version of that missing packet. Open \"Software & Updates\" and select the \"Other Software\" tab. Scroll down to the happy-nekok ppa you added and select it. Then choose \"Edit\" at the bottom of the window. In the \"Distribution\" line, delete \"trusty\" and type \"raring\". Hit \"OK\" and exit \"Software & Updates\"--doing so should also prompt a fresh scan of available packages.\nNow, you are going to install that package missing from the noobslab ppa:\nsudo apt-get install ps3mediaserver-multiarch\n\nNow that the missing dependency is installed. You should have success in installing the PS3 Media Server from the NoobsLab PPA:\nsudo apt-get install ps3mediaserver\n\nNote: I had to install several other dependencies in order to get this to work, but they were already existing in the regular Ubuntu software sources.\nIf the NoobsLab PPA is updated to include the ps3mediaserver-multiarch package in the future that new trusty distribution of the package should supersede this raring distribution. At that time you can just remove the Happy-Neko PPA as it would no longer be providing you any packages.\n", "Q: Cant enable bluetooth on Thinkpad X220 xUbuntu 14.04 I am having problems enabling bluetooth since installing xUbuntu 14.04 on my Thinkpad X220, in 13.10 all was working fine.\nWhen I installed 14.04 I did a fresh install rather than upgrade.\nRunning\n/proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth\n\nreturns no such file or directory, so I'm guessing that I don't have the appropriate IBM bluetooth drivers installed.\n/proc/acpi/ibm/ only contains: beep, cmos, driver, fan, hotkey, led, light, video, volume\nWhere can I get these from?\nCheers\nJim\n\nUpdate:\nIt would appear that the Bluetooth daughter card is not being recognised at all, I have swapped the card over as I have 2 of them, but still no luck.

So if you desire, to skip the rant, please skip to the questions.\nThis is my third day using Ubuntu 14.04 and so far I’m liking it over Windows XP/7 and really want to completely transition to Linux. Being a victim of Microsoft’s business model of “future sales through forced obsolescence” is proving to be a strong motivator. Having to update already purchased applications for XP due to the incompatibility with Win7/8 is looking to be very expensive for me and on top of that the added cost of a new operating systems. I have three computers at home that the family uses and having to update all of them is out of the question.  Plus I’m the IT support for others in my extended family, which is nearly an additional 10 computers.\nAs a newbie with the hopes of using Ubuntu as a Windows XP/7 replacement these difficulties and indifferences are making it rather difficult in understanding Linux and seem to be clouding my perception a bit.  So please help me to make the transitions and I will bring others over from the Windows side. \nAnyway I apologize for expressing my frustration, but I feel it may help other new users to understand that there are some major challenges in learning Linux, and not to give up. That is why I’m asking these questions.\nAll these questions stem from the simple task of adding Skype to my “Applications Startup”.\nQuestion 1)\nIn more than one reference I have found that there was an “Options” in the “Startup Applications” that would allow me to check a box to start the applications already open on the next reboot/restart.

Isn't Android Studio compatible with OpenJDK and should I use Oracle JDK instead?\n\nA: It seems that Android Studio does not recognize OpenJDK, so I need to install the OracleJDK.\nThen I choose the path to Oracle JDK and it worked!\n\nA: This worked for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the java directory:\n$ echo $JAVA_HOME\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle\n\n\n*Open Android Studio and then File-> Project Structure.\n\n*Under SDK Location I past the java directory from above\n\n*Wait a couple of seconds and I got \"0 errores 0 advertencias\"\n\n\nIt worked! :)\n\nA: I'm using OpenJDK 7 with Android Studio and it works just fine. (I don't even have Oracle JDK installed at the moment.)\nOn that screen that you are showing (Project Structure-->SKD Location) I have the following path for the JDK location: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64.\n\nA: Steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opened terminal and enter echo $JAVA_HOME\n\n*Copied the path displayed in terminal - Ctrl+Shift+C copy in Ubuntu terminal\n\n*In Android studio - Project Structure - Pasted the copied path \n\n*Waited for the software to recognize and update the settings \n\n*This solved the problem of Invalid Jdk settings \n\nA: By inspecting studio.sh, you can also set one of STUDIO_JDK, JDK_HOME or JAVA_HOME environment variables to point to the JDK location.\n\nstudio.sh checks the STUDIO_JDK, JDK_HOME, and JAVA_HOME environment variables in order:\nif [ -n \"$STUDIO_JDK\" -a -x \"$STUDIO_JDK/bin/java\" ]; then\n  JDK=\"$STUDIO_JDK\"\nelif [ -n \"$JDK_HOME\" -a -x \"$JDK_HOME/bin/java\" ]; then\n  JDK=\"$JDK_HOME\"\nelif [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" -a -x \"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\" ]; then\n  JDK=\"$JAVA_HOME\"\n\nSo you can just set them as appropriate and then Studio will pick it up.\n\nA: I fixed this problem. \nI use AS 2.1 and JDK1.7 while it required me to update JDK1.8 for some functions. I download the java setup file. Maybe I only installed jre but not jdk. so AS always warn me that \"Please choose a valid JDK directory\".\nSo I guess the asker's problem same as me that you should install a JDK but not jre.\n\nA: If you have a ./bin folder with a JDK and Android Studio, you can set the STUDIO_JDK variable before running studio.sh in a terminal:\nSTUDIO_JDK=./bin/jdk/ ./bin/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\n\n\nA: I think that you might have installed the jdk somewhere else for e.g. /usr/local/java. In my case also I saw the same folder name in the directory shown in your screenshot. \nSo just check if the jdk is present somewhere else.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 - No Screen resolution changer?

This is probably a bug in Matlab(1) which should not allow a CTRL-Z arrive to nano if it can't cope with it...\nThe problem is that the shell command fg (and bg, and jobs) works only with direct children of the shell.  But you can continue a stopped process from another shell, although this will not guarantee that the status of the screen is correctly managed:\n\n\n*\n\n*in another terminal window, find the nano process:\n% ps ugx | grep nano\nromano   10600  0.0  0.0  20784  1628 pts/11   T    16:52   0:00 nano prova\nromano   10653  0.0  0.0  18256   900 pts/11   S+   16:53   0:00 grep nano\n\n\n*Notice that it is stopped (state T)\n\n*Continue it with \nkill -CONT 10600 \n\n...and hope it works (can mess up the terminal greatly).

This may be a hardware problem, but given the solution I found (below), I kind of doubt it.\n\nA: To fix this problem, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in headphones\n\n*Click the speaker icon in the top-right and open the sound settings control panel.  On the output tab, notice that it list the \"Headphones Output\" and the \"Analog Output\" (for you, you may be using Digital Output).\n\n*Select your \"Analog Output\" and click \"Test Sound\" to open the test sound menu\n\n*Click \"Test\" (either front left or front right), and quickly while the test sound is still playing, unplug the headphones.\n\n\nThis caused the headphone output to properly disappear, leaving the \"Analog Output\" in a working state.\n\nA: If you dual boot with Windows 8, see this answer.

Is it safe to continue my work or I should stop immediately? \n\nA: EDIT!\nYou will be fine the processor does not crap out till about 100 Cel.  At your current temp readings your computer will be ok to handle the heat and the load required for what you are doing on it.\n\nA: 81C is a max, worry if it goes over.

If i try for example :\ndirectory A i don't have write permission on it \nsudo ls -l > /home/A/a.txt\nbash: /home/A/a.txt: Permission denied\n\nThen how can i do this trick , any Suggestion is appreciated . \n\nA: tee is the command people would usually use. You can pipe to it and it redirects into the file (as well as the console).\nls -l | sudo tee /home/A/a.txt\n\nIt also has an append flag (equivalent to >>):\nls -l | sudo tee -a /home/A/a.txt\n\nThe alternative is wrapping an entire subshell in your sudo:\nsudo bash -c 'ls -l > /home/A/a.txt'\n\n\nI preference tee mostly because that way you're still running the bulk of the command as the lower user. When you wrap everything in a sudo bash -c '...' construct, the whole thing gets executed as the root user. Redirecting something like whoami into another user's directory could become troublesome.\nAs I lead with, tee also bounces the output back to STDOUT. This makes chaining commands pretty simple.\nFor example if you wanted to compile a .less file into CSS (and save it) \"minimise\" that CSS (and save it) and then compress that minimised copy with gzip to save your server doing it (and save that).\nYou could use bare commands, using full filenames each time:\nlessc less/bootstrap.less > dist/bootstrap.css\ncleancss --selectors-merge-mode ie8 dist/bootstrap.css > dist/boostrap.min.css\ngzip -qk9 dist/boostrap.min.css\n\nor just pipe it around with tee:\nlessc less/bootstrap.less | tee dist/bootstrap.css \\\n  | cleancss --selectors-merge-mode ie8 | tee dist/boostrap.min.css \\\n  | gzip -qc9 > dist/boostrap.min.css\n\nThat's code I use daily.\nIt probably is more efficient (you're saving reading from the subsequent files, tee keeps it in memory) but I think more than anything it's objectively prettier code. That's an underrated aspect when you're dealing with this nonsense on a day to day basis.\n\nA: You can create the file using sudo (or as the user owning the directory):\nsudo touch /home/A/a.txt\n\nNow you can make another user the owner of the file using:\nsudo chown username:username /home/A/a.txt\n\nReplace username by the username you want to be the owner.\nOr if you want all users to be able to read and edit the file:\nsudo chmod 666 /home/A/a.txt\n\n\nNote: using > you won't append to the file.

I like Dash, but it's lacking some nice features: (I know I'm being a bit fussy.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Partial search - In Kupfer I don't have to type exactly in order. Let's say, I have both version 3.7 and 4.3 of Eclipse installed. In Kupfer I can search for the former by typing in Ec3. No need to type out Eclipse 3.\n\n*Calculator - e.g. Typing =2 + sqrt(2) * pi gives me the result\n\n*There's a plugin to use the browsers search engines.

(The same can be done for showing a message on screen. For example, to remind me of something.)\n\n\nA: I'd say the answer is no, not without so much work that it would outweigh the minor inconvenience of using Kupfer directly for the things it does well.  \nAs your examples do a great job of highlighting, it's a very useful app. \nUnity Dash is also useful, but its UI seems entirely oriented toward search, one-field search. (Modulo configurable filtering.) It's hard to imagine how you would bring into Dash the kind of subject-verb command composition that's part of what makes Kupfer so handy -- without essentially cloning Kupfer. And since you already have Kupfer, you don't need a clone.\nI don't mean to dismiss your question, but nonetheless I can't see a way to answer \"yes\" to it.

I want to rebuild my mobile workstation (HP EliteBook 8560w) to dual boot CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 14.01LTS. I would like to protect both instances with LUKS.

(I think the answer is \"no\"...not certain.)\n\n*Does it matter which distribution I install first?\n\n\nThanks much for any guidance. I will try to provide updates as I make progress.\n\nA: \nShould I partition the drive, including the EFI System Partition, before beginning either installation?\n\nI would; however, most distributions, including both Ubuntu and CentOS, provide partitioning tools as part of their installers. Doing it ahead of time has the advantage that you'll be using cross-distribution tools (such as GParted, parted, or gdisk) that are usually more powerful than the tools that the distribution installers provide.\n\nMy CentOS build requires several partitions for /, /home, /tmp, /var/log etc.; can I use Logical Volumes inside a LUKS partition for this, or does each filesystem require its own LUKS partition?\n\nThe term logical volume applies to Logical Volume Manager (LVM) configuration. As such, logical volumes are stored within (and sometimes across multiple) LVM partitions (known as physical volumes in LVM-speak). I don't know offhand if it's possible to encrypt a physical volume, but you can certainly encrypt each logical volume individually. I've got one system set up this way. I don't recall offhand what documentation I followed when setting up this system, but Googling on terms like \"CentOS encrypted LVM\" produces plenty of hits.\n\nWill I need to use or chain load GRUB with this design? (I think the answer is \"no\"...not certain.)\n\nI haven't checked CentOS's default EFI boot loader, but it's probably either a patched GRUB Legacy or GRUB 2. Ubuntu definitely uses GRUB 2 by default. If you use the default settings, the first distribution you install will set up for itself alone and the second will set up for itself and either chainload the other one or add entries to directly boot the other. How well this works is hard to predict; the setup scripts don't generally do as good a job with \"foreign\" distributions as they do with their own.\nIf you dislike GRUB, you can manually configure any of several alternatives. I describe all the major ones on my Web page devoted to this topic, so check there if you want to know what I think of them all. Note that some of them have requirements that might affect how you partition the disk. For instance, if you use ELILO or gummiboot, you'll probably want to make a bigger EFI System Partition (ESP) than with some others. Anything but GRUB or rEFInd will require manual adjustments as you add and remove kernels. (GRUB doesn't need this because the distributions keep their GRUB configurations up-to-date; rEFInd doesn't need it because it scans for kernels at boot times and builds its boot list dynamically.)\n\nDoes it matter which distribution I install first?\n\nIf you plan to use the default boot loader, it can -- the one whose boot loader you want to use is the one you should install second. If you plan to switch to another boot loader, though, I don't think it's likely to make much difference.\n", "Q: How to make GRUB boot straight to Ubuntu Server 14.04 I was following this tutorial and it says to gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub but I get this message:\nroot@ubuntuBirdCage:/home/bird47# gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub  \n(gksudo:8029): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:  \n\nDid they change something for Ubuntu 14.04? I want to boot straight into my Ubuntu Server, and not have to select it from this list.\n\nA: I assume you're using Ubuntu Server.\nUbuntu Server is usually installed on a headless computer and therefore doesn't have a GUI in order to save resources.\nBecause of this you can't run graphical programs (like gedit) on Ubuntu Server, unless you install a desktop manager (GUI). gksudo is used to run graphical applications with superuser priveleges. To run a terminal command as superuser you would just use sudo.\nSo, as mentioned in the comments, you should use a CLI text editor.\n\n\n*\n\n*vim (advanced)\nvim /path/to/the/file/to/edit.txt\n\n\n*nano (easy)\nnano /path/to/the/file/to/edit.txt\n\n\nA: There are a couple of issues here, presented in descending order of importance\n\n\n*\n\n*You're already logged in as root, so you don't need to use sudo (or its equivalents). You're already root! All you need to do is run gedit /etc/default/grub.\n\n*However, if this is a server, you probably don't have a GUI running at all. That means that graphical applications like gedit won't be able to run and you need a command line editor instead. The simplest of those is nano:\nnano /etc/default/grub\n\nThe best of them is emacs although some poor misguided people1 insist on using a thing called vim.\nIf you are running a GUI on your server, this could be happening for a variety of reasons, depending on how you're connecting to it. Please have a look at my answer here, I go through most of them.\n\n1 This should not be taken seriously. That's a long running gag in the *nix community, vim is an excellent piece of software, I just happen to be in the emacs camp. We get pretty worked up about which is best but, in all honesty, they're both great. \n\nA: \n\n\n*\n\n*You need use nano, vi or vim instead of gedit command. Run it as root to edit /etc/default/grub.\n\n*Change the value GRUB_DEFAULT=0 in /etc/default/grub. The value depend on your grub bootup menu. GRUB_DEFAULT=0 means the first item in bootup menu will be boot up as default; GRUB_DEFAULT=1 means the second item in bootup menu will be boot up as default.

The steps are defined based on the order of how recent a wind had the focus.\nYou can leave the thee windows you currently work on fully visible, make the fourth to eighth most recently focussed window get darker in four steps, and keep all other windows in very dark so they are barely recognizable.\n\n\n*Opacify is somewhat more complex and controls only opacity, but I expect it can be used in a similar way.\n", "Q: Sound jumping between speakers and headphones when volume is high I am using Ubuntu 14.04, but had this problem on previous versions of Ubuntu.\nWhen the volume is higher than 45% and I am playing music the sound switches between head phones and speakers, but there is no headphones plugged in.\nIt does not matter which program is used to play music with.\n\nA: Try plugging in headphones and turning the volume down, then unplug them and re test.

You will always need to run it with sudo though, the best you can get is passwordless sudo for certain commands.\nThis is because of the way the system works. When you attempt to run, for example reboot, as a normal user, you get this message:\n$ reboot\nreboot: must be superuser.\n\nThis has nothing to do with sudo, the command in question simply checks whether your userid is 1 (the super user) and if it is not, it won't let you run it. You could set up your system to have another user as userid 1 but that would simply change the username of root and would be a lot of trouble for no reason (and would not help you do what you are attempting anyway).\nSo, unless you are actually logged in as the user whose userid is 1, you will always have to use sudo to run privileged commands. The only workaround would be to create an alias (or a function, or a script) for reboot in your shells's configuration file (~/.bashrc for example):\nalias reboot='sudo reboot'\n\nThat way, since you have already set shutdown to be passwordless in /etc/sudoers, you will be able to run\n$ reboot\n\nand get your desired result.\n", "Q: How to reset grub to see both windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04?

I have a graphic intensive game on windows. My computer can dual boot between Ubuntu and windows, but not at the same time. I theoretically have the option to run one OS as a virtual OS inside of the other. What is the difference between running a game and a virtual Linux OS in windows versus running Linux with a virtual OS of windows running a game?\n\nA: You will lose a lot of speed running from any virtual environment, unfortunately. So if you run native Linux, with Windows in a virtual environment (VMWare, VirtualBox, or another one), then a program inside you lost a lot of processing, even in unity mode.\nFor example, think of it like this, your OS requires a fraction of your total memory/processor to keep running no matter what, the virtualizing program needs a fraction of memory, the virtual OS is given a fraction of your total memory, and the program running requires a fraction of your total memory. \nIt is a lot of processing power to do it honestly, and RAM. Think whatever recommended (not minimum requirements, but to run it at best quality) double or triple it.\n\nA: Firstly, running a game on a virtual machine cannot possibly utilise all the memory and CPU. This is because the other os still needs memory.  It (the os) isn't treated as a background service either.  It's best to run windows games on windows.  That is unless you have like 1tb of ram and Nvida GeForce Titan (or something even more powerful :P)\n\nA: Your better off playing that game in WINE.  Linux utilizes resources in more appropriate manners.  Wine just emulates without bloat-ware.\n", "Q: usb-creator-gtk doesn't find my virtual disk. What's wrong?

Choose 'Create Create a connection'.\nLeave the name as 'provider', hit 'Ok'.\nSelect 'Dynamic Use dynamic DNS', hit 'Ok'.\nSelect 'PAP Peer Authentication Protocol', hit 'Ok'.\nEnter your user name for the ISP, hit 'Ok'.\nEnter your password for the ISP, hit 'Ok'.\nLeave the speed at 115200 as recommended, hit 'Ok'.\nChoose Tone or Pulse dialing, hit 'Ok'.\nEnter the phone number to your ISP (do not use any dashes), hit 'Ok'.\nYou can try to have your modem detected automatically, but it did not work for me, even on my easily detectable external modem.\nIf the modem wasn't detected, it will ask you for the port your modem is on. Enter the device name for your modem, hit 'Ok'.\nA summary screen will appear and give you the opportunity to make changes if needed.\nChoose 'Finished Write files and return to main menu.'.\nChoose 'Quit Exit this utility'.\n\nExit the terminal window, type:\n\n  $ exit\n\nConnecting to the ISP\nLog out and back in (for the group setting to take effect). Every \"dialout/dip\" user will now be able to connect and disconnect with these commands:\n $ pon    # connect to the ISP configured as \"provider\"\n $ poff   # disconnect the ISP configured as \"provider\"\n\nYou can also check the last messages generated by these commands with:\n $ plog   # shows the (status) messages generated by pon and poff\n\n", "Q: Themes for Ubuntu 14.04 I want to download themes for ubuntu 14.04, but I was confused because in the folder /usr/share/themes there are 18 folder. And the only folder that contains gtk-2.0, gtk-3.0, metacity-1, unity, and one file 'index.theme' that can be used for theme.\nSo I had to have a theme with gtk-2.0, gtk-3.0, metacity-1, unity, and the file 'index.theme'?\n\nA: You can get a lot of themes from http://gnome-looks.org \nThe safest way is to create a .themes directory in your home for themes and .icons for icon themes.\nYou can also, but not recommend, extract the archives you download, and move the correct theme folder to /usr/share/themes\nA theme folder consist of elements like gtk-2.0, gtk-3.0, metacity-1, unity, index.theme\nYou will need to start the file manager as super user when copying the themes:\ngksudo nautilus\n\nI personally avoid this because you could wrongly and unintentionally delete some important system file. \nInstall unity-tweak-tool from Ubuntu Software Center to change the themes.\n", "Q: Repositories error I was using 14.04 beta, When the stable release rolled out, I thought

How does Ubuntu touch resolves this issue? Does it use VLC as the backend?\n\nA: The Mp3/Mp4 support is third party used.  Unless you install them, no media player put in by default runs them.\nThere are different repositories that do supply them. This one I use is Fluendo mp3 decoder GStreamer 0.10 plugin.\n\nA: Much of what Canonical did when building Ubuntu Touch was about enabling OEMs to use their existing android drivers with UT. OEMs are reluctant to release sources for their devices' drivers. Not only that, there are many hardware manufacturers which have different policies so it is hard to get something more than a binary blob. Essentially, there is an interfacing layer called libhybris which talks to a part of Android's multimedia stack called AndroidMedia. Then there is a gst-hybris GStreamer plugin. GStreamer is used as a backend for Qt's multimedia stack. In the end, you have your hardware acceleration if your chip supports and OpenMAX (omx) APIs are implemented.\nTake a look at the page 20 in the \"Ubuntu touch internals\" and at Android's multimedia stack:\nhttp://elinux.org/images/c/cf/Ubuntu_Touch_Internals_1.pdf#20\nhttps://source.android.com/devices/media.html\n\nA: I recommend installing the Fluendo codec. An easy way to install this codec and a few others is to install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package. First, make sure you have the Universe repositories enabled. Then you will need to open a terminal. How to do this varies by GNU/Linux distro and desktop, but you can figure it out. Then, type sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras in it. Press Enter. This will install some useful codecs, some fonts made by Microsoft, but no programs, except for Adobe Flash Player. You may need to restart your system afterwards. However there is no prompt or warning of any kind to restart your system, I recommend doing so anyway. The reason doing all of this is necessary is because Canonical Ltd. (the makers of Ubuntu) could not include the proprietary codecs in Ubuntu because they were not free. However, installing this package takes care of it and installs the codecs, Adobe Flash Player, and Microsoft TrueType Fonts anyway. \n", "Q: Swap partition showing unknown. Can I format it to ntfs or ext4 for keeping my files or this will cause problems to system? I don't need swap space The gnome disk utility shows a partition with 3.1 GB is linux swap with unknown content. In a terminal running free command total swap shows 0. What does this mean?\nI don't need any swap space, so can I format this partition to ntfs or ext4 safely (without disturbing the system)?\n[Edit]\nI have encrypted /home. I have 3 GB RAM and I don't have to run any heavy application in Ubuntu so I don't need swap.\nDuring installation, I allocated 13 GB to Ubuntu of which only 1.5 GB is left. .In Gnome disk utility it is showing 3.1 GB is linux swap but in gparted it is not recognized as linux swap (it just says unknown). So I want to just format it.\nMy question is: does deleting or formatting that partition cause any error? (If yes, then I will drop this option and increase my partition size instead.)\n\nA: If you don't want swap anymore then swapoff the swap partition through gparted and then format it to ext4 or ntfs(whatever you want) for storing your datas.\nFor mine, the output of the free command is,\n          total           used       free\nSwap:     10501116          0      10501116\n\nWhich means, the total size of my swap partition is 10 GB, from that 0 space was used.\n\nA: It's recommended to have the swap partition, anyway if you want to give it the correct format you can do it from shell commands with mkswap /dev/sdax where a stands for your disk and x stand for the partition number. \nAn easy way to turn of your swap partition is swapoff. \n", "Q: Set All .jar FIles As Executable I run Java programs alot on my computer.

I have tried looking for drivers for them online and searched for people with similar issues, but I was unable to find a solution to the problem. I am doing all my experiments on the OS on the USB stick and plan to install it once I am certain of the solutions. Any help would be deeply appreciated.\nEdit 1: I installed it on my laptop. I have audio output from my headphones but none through my speakers. I see the value set to 00 in alsamixer for Speaker but I am unable to change it. Also, I tried reinstalling pulseaudio using the commands available online and also adding the generic type to the end of the file /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf. But nothing seems to work.\nEdit 2: Okay this is crazy, but I read this suggestion here and it said close the lid and open it again. When I closed the lid Ubuntu went to sleep and then when I logged in again, the internal speakers started working. Also, the first time I installed Ubuntu, it was in dual boot with Windows 7.

So it occurred to me that the original problem may have been started when once in the past I executed Firefox as root.\nIt seems Firefox creates some temporary files and uses them to do these jobs like reopening closed tabs. Since in root mode, the owner of these temporary files is root, in normal mode it cannot overwrite those files and so the related features are disabled!\nTo fix this I ran this command to change all of the Firefox's config files' ownership to my user using this command:\nsudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.mozilla/firefox/ -R\n\nand then I restarted Firefox and it worked.\n", "Q: Netbeans installation doesn't work While trying to install Netbeans 8.0 in my Ubuntu 14.04 I get the following error: \nCan`t initialize UI Running in headless mode\nException: java.awt.HeadlessException thrown from the\nUncaughtExceptionHandler in thread \"main\"\n\nI have previously installed openjdk 7 and yet it's not working for some reason.\n\nA: Searching the internet I found that the problem is with openjdk's support with the UI.\nThe solution is pretty simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall openjdk\n\n*Install oracle jdk\n\n*Reinstall Netbeans\n\n\nUse the following commands:\nsudo apt-get remove openjdk*   \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer  \nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-set-default\n\nAnd install* Netbeans again, this should fix the problem.\n*Usually via bash, for example: bash netbeans-8.0\n\nA: I have got same error message but after installing of openjdk-7-jdk Netbeans was installed without any issues.\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\n\nA: You do not have to uninstall OpenJDK in order to install Netbeans.

I never exported either Tor's or Firefox's bookmarks, so I'm hoping they are lying around somewhere in the Ubuntu Filesystem. Is this the case? I am assuming I can just take the Tor bundle directory with me, use it in a Linux virtual machine, and export it's bookmarks, but what about Firefox? Can I just take it's directory with me someplace else? If so, where is Firefox installed?\n\nA: In fact, you just have to copy the folder \"firefox\" and all its content.\nThis folder is located in the hidden folder \".mozilla\" of your personal folder (/home/username/).\nOn another operating system (Linux, Mac or Windows), you just have to launch Mozilla Firefox once. Then close it and copy the profile folder (xxxxxx.default) from the \"firefox\" backup folder in the corresponding \"firefox\" folder for your platform. After that, I recommend you to edit \"profiles.ini\" and replace the \"Path\" value by the name of the profile folder copied instead of overwriting that file with the one from the backup.\nOn Windows 7/8/8.1, you'll find \"firefox\" folder (containing profiles) in \"C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\\".\nThat's what I use very often to do the contrary (migrating from Windows or Mac to Linux).\nP.S.: Please note that you may have to replace add-ons which are designed for Linux by the ones designed for your platform.\n\nA: All your firefox settings are there in the hidden ~/.mozilla/firefox directory. There you'll find another directory ending with *.default within which you'll find a directory called \"bookmarkbackups\" that contains time to time backup of all your bookmarks as *.jason files. You can import a *.jason file in firefox bookmark library.\nThere is an option to sync all the firefox data...bookmark passwords etc. online. When you sign in to that account on a different device, it will sync back all your firefox data. I hope it will help you in future from data loss.\n\n", "Q: kde folder widget custom icon?

It is a system file, provided by the virtual procfs filesystem, and is not a real file.\n", "Q: Vlsub extension for vlc issue On freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04, with freshly installed vlc, the vlsub extension launches a window when no file is open.

I've read in at least three places that the \"backports\" repository is more tested (and hence stable) than the \"proposed\" repository. However, the official Ubuntu webpages state:\n\n\"Unsupported Updates (raring-backports)\"... Packages may contain new\n  features, may introduce new interfaces, and have not been sufficiently\n  tested to be included in the 'proposed' repository.\n\nThis implies to me that packages firstly land in the \"backports\" repository. If they are then sufficiently tested, then they will move to the \"proposed\" repository. Hence, \"proposed\" would appear to be more tested than \"backports\".

After the upgrade, however, I got well-known warnings like\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@       WARNING: POSSIBLE DNS SPOOFING DETECTED!          @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nThe ECDSA host key for xxxx has changed,\n\n, if I try to ssh into the computer from another linux computer.\nIf I try to log into the the computer from MinGW/Windows, which the host/server has a stored public key of, the login was successful for a few seconds and then the ssh session froze. The network for the host/server is down for about a few hours to a day, during which time I can't even ping the server. But it went back online again after that.\nMy question is:\nIs it possible/normal that a LTS upgrade like mine change the host key at all?\nOr is it more likely my computer is under man-in-the-middle-attack.\nHow do I verify which is the case?\nThanks.\n-- Update --\nTo try to fix the problem, I restored an Ubuntu 12.04 image that I made before the upgrade to 14.04 using fsarchive and a second Ubuntu installation. I did the recover many times before and never had a problem. But this time, after the recovery, the restored Ubuntu 12.04 wouldn't boot. I was left with a grub prompt.\nThen, fixing grub, I used a liveusb to re-install grub (chroot, grub-install /dev/sda etc). Again, this fixes grub every time in the past but not this time. grub-install reports some error about \"FlexNet\" using sector 32. \nI finally fixed grub after googling, and finding two lines of command to backup and wipe out the MBR. I don't know if anyone has had similar issue before. I never installed any software called FlexNet on my windows dual boot or Linux. And it happened only after I upgrade to 14.04 LTS. Is this a sign my computer was hacked?\nAfter I fixed grub, I was able to upgrade again to 14.04 LTS, without any issue so far.\n\nA: FlexNet is an anti-piracy software license manager software. It embeds some signature in sector 32 as a simple check to prevent people from copying it (because pirates would never figure out how to copy disk sectors). Because it is embedded in the drive header, the FlexNet signature will survive repartitioning etc. It is possible that someone installed the software previously on the drive, perhaps it once had Windows installed?\nTo blank the FlexNet sector:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 seek=32\n\nRegarding the ssh issue, see this answer where a user in a similar situation found that an upgrade added a line to sshd conf:\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n\nIt is possible that the same happened to you - your server was using RSA/DSA keys, no ECDSA key was declared in the config (even if one did exist on the disk), but when you upgraded the server config was changed, and now ssh is complaining.\n\nA: Since you seem to have physical access to the machine in question, have it tell you what its fingerprint is:\n\n*\n\n* you@SuspiciousMachine $ sudo ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\nCompare that to what your linux machines are reporting and determine authenticity.\nNOTE:  Make sure you're printing the right key.

I've never used any OS other than windows, but have decided to try ubuntu 14.04. I have 30GB of free space on the SSD and 200GB on the HDD. Now what partitions should I create? \nI really have no idea how the file system in ubuntu works. I have been reading a lot and got a lot of conflicting information. \nIn Windows I use the SSD for the OS and smaller programs and the HDD for bigger programs, games and other large files. I want to do it similarly for ubuntu. I also want to be able to exchange files between Windows and ubuntu without them interfering.\nSo obviously /root should go on the SSD, as that takes most advantage of the SSD's speed? How big should /root be?\nI seem to also need a /home partition. Where should I put that, if some of my programs should go on the SSD and some on the HDD? Is it possible to \"split\" /home between both? Or can I install programs outside of home? If yes, what would the disadvantages of that be? Should I install programs on home at all or is it simply the ubuntu equivalent to Windows' Appdata, and programs themselves should go somewhere completely different?\nLastly, what about swap? A lot of conflicting information on that. Some say you don't need it at all, some say it should be a fixed size, some say it needs to be more, the more ram you have. I have 8GB ram, which I almost never fully use and I do not plan on ever hibernating. \nSo as I understand it, swap is basically a reserve for when your ram is all in use. What's the worst thing that can happen, if I don't have swap? And why would it need to be larger if I have MORE ram? Shouldn't I need LESS \"reserve\", if I already have more \"actual ram\"? Also, why do I need an extra partition anyway? AFAIK windows simply uses a normal file pagefile.sys on the normal partition, which can easily be changed in size. What's the advantage of having an extra partition?\nAlso, if I do need swap, where should I put it? Some sources they it wears out the SSD much more quickly, others say that won't be a problem for over 20 years and swap benefits hugely from being on the SSD.\nSorry if my questions sound stupid, I'm long-term Windows user, who was just convinced to try ubuntu.\nThanks in advance for any help you can give a ubuntu beginner!\n\nA: I`ve been a dual-boot-er for almost 4 years now and I have not yet seen Ubuntu needing and taking advantage of SSD speed. So I recommend installing Ubuntu on the HDD, leaving the SSD to deal with Windows for data security reasons.\nYou will need a minimum of 2 partitions:\n1) an ext (ext4 recommended) that will be /. In this partition you will have the /home, /root and everything.\n2) a swap partition. In the old days, it was recommended to have the swap double the RAM ammount. Nowadays, you no longer need that. Just make a 8GB swap at the end ogf the HDD.\nAs for the / partition, the size depends on what you want to do. My / is 30GB.\nThe programs you install will be in the / partition.\nSo:\n1) Create a ~35GB primary ext4 partition on the HDD (preferably at the beginning of the partition table, but if not, at the end will do), with the mount point: /\n2) Create a 8GB partition on the HDD (preferably at the end of the partition table) and select \"use as: Swap area\"\nEverything will be OK like this. Hope my advice helped you. Welcome to Ubuntu!\n\nA: To help you with your confusion:\n/root is not the directory where the system is installed. It's the home directory of the \"allmighty system administrator\", known as root user (username is root, user ID=0)\nWhat you're probably thinking of is the root directory. Windows has multiple root directories, C:, D: and so on. Most other OS's, including Linux, only got one root directory: /. The system gets installed into various subfolders of it: /bin, /boot, /usr, ...\nNo program gets installed into /home. This is where the users have there own directories, e.g. /home/sebastian/ for me. This is where you store your own stuff (like C:\\Users\\username\\ on Win 7 or C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\ on XP). Programs only store there configuration stuff in here. Most programs get installed somewhere into /usr.\n\nWhat I'm now writing is opinion based and everyone got another opinion on it. I can't recommend you any scenario, you have to choose:\nScenario 1 (no swap, you'll have to live with 8GB of RAM (should be enough)):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the SSD to install the core system in (mountpoint /)\n\n*Because it's only 30GB, you should put /home to the HDD\n\n\nScenario 2 (8GB of SWAP):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a 8GiB swap partition on the SSD, use the rest for your core system (/)\n\n*Create a partition on the HDD for /home\n\n*Create another partition for /usr\n\n*I'd recommend to the HDD 100GiB for /home and 100 for /usr, but this is up to you\n\n\nA: Ubuntu needs at least 5 GB of free disk space for itself.\nYou can create a 30 GB partition on your SSD for Ubuntu, but I think you mean you have 30 GB of free space on Windows, so if you create a 30 GB partition Windows will have no free space left, which will cause problems for Windows.\nSo you could create a 20 GB partition for Ubuntu (Ubuntu partitions can't be used by Windows) on your SSD. You'll use mount point / for this one, which is basically the root FS. All your applications will be stored here too if you use Ubuntu's package manager. This shouldn't be a problem as most programs are not so big and you've ~10 GB of free space (Ubuntu will preserve some space for its journal and /root directory).\nIf you've a really big application you can compile it yourself in your home/bin directory. Or if you use Steam for example you can choose to store your library in your home directory.\nThen create a partition on your HDD for /home. This is the partition where all your personal files (like documents, downloads, videos, settings) will be stored (like the Users directory in Windows). As this will probably contain the \"big data\" it's a good idea to create this partition on your HDD.\nThe swap partition is the same as the swap file in Windows. It's virtual RAM. If you have enough RAM and don't need hibernation, you don't need it. If you ever need it, you can always create a swap partition after installing Ubuntu or you can create a swap file.\nAlso, both Windows and Ubuntu can read and write on NTFS (but you can't install Ubuntu on NTFS). So if you want to share files between the two, create (or use an existing) a NTFS partition.\n", "Q: How to launch .sh from third party program?

Unfortunately, you'll run into issues trying to resize or edit an active partition.\nYou will need to run a Live Distribution in order to modify your SSD's partitions.  You can do this with Ubuntu itself, or try out the [no-longer free] partedmagic.

I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I want to know why some very useful packages not pre-installed with Ubuntu?\nI am talking about packages like:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n*gstreamer & libavcodecor vlc\n\n*gksu\nOptional: nautilus-open-terminal,unity-tweak-tool, hardinfo etc.\n\nIs there any security or legal purpose? Is it not available any-how in feauture?\n\nA: The reason for the packages ubuntu-restricted-extras, gstreamer and libavcodec not being pre-installed on a default installation are purely legal than technical. These packages are non-free and the user has to accept a licence agreement (the EULA agreement). These packages will not be inducted into the default installation in future too, unless the licence changes.\nAlso, the packages gimp, nautilus-open-terminal, gdebi, unity-tweak-tool, gparted and p7-zip full may or may not be needed by many users who don't care to manipulate images(gimp) or their own hard disk(gparted), etc. However, these may or may not be included in future default releases depending upon whether Canonical feels the need.\n\nA: There are different reasons:\nSome of the packages are not included for possible copyright infringement in certain countries.\nSome are not included to keep the initial image file not too big.\nOthers are simply not included because they are of use only to a relatively small percentage of users.\n", "Q: How can I find my User ID (UID) from terminal?

For some reason I need to disable a system service on boot. In my case this is the Avahi Daemon. I just don't want it to start on boot.\nIn previous Ubuntu releases (e.g. 12.04) I could do\nsudo update-rc.d avahi-daemon disable\n\nHowever on 14.04 it shows\nupdate-rc.d: warning:  start runlevel arguments (none) do not match avahi-daemon Default-Start values (2 3 4 5)\nupdate-rc.d: warning:  stop runlevel arguments (none) do not match avahi-daemon Default-Stop values (0 1 6)\n System start/stop links for /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon do not exist.\n\nAnd Avahi is started on boot. How can I disable this? I'm looking for a command line way of doing this.\nAnd please care to explain what happened here? Some change in a recent Ubuntu release broke the use of update-rc.d? I suspect I'm missing something here.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses Upstart instead of SysV Init to start services on boot. Thus some services don't have an SysV Init script but an Upstart job description file in /etc/init/ (not /etc/init.d/). For those update-rc.d doesn't work. \nUse\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/avahi-daemon.override\n\nto disable avahi-daemon starting at boot.

I just wanted to try out MAAS dashboard so, i have created a MAAS server on ubuntu server 14.04 in VMware. However, i did not get the prompt for setting server URL as http://10.x.x.x/MAAS as described here. \nI tried reinstalling it several times, but never made out till that prompt. The setup then continues as normal till end.\nSo, is there any way to get server URL from command line ?\n\nA: You can learn more about MAAS here and also here.\nInstallation instructions are available to read here\nThere is further documentation on this page.\nYou can get the local ip address of any ubuntu machine by opening a terminal and issuing the command:\nifconfig which will produce results including a line similar to this:\ninet addr:192.168.15.131 in which case the local ipv4 address is 192.168.15.131\nYou can obtain your outside ip address on this page\n", "Q: How do I configure a default principal for kinit (acquiring Kerberos ticket)? When using kinit to acquire a Kerberos ticket I have configured it to use a default realm, e.g. GERT.LAN by editing /etc/krb5.conf:\n[libdefaults]\n        default_realm = GERT.LAN\n\nThat's great since I don't have to supply that all the time on the command line.\n⟫ kinit\ngert@GERT.LAN's Password:\n\nHowever, my local username gert does not match the remote username gertvdijk. Now I have to supply the full principal name as an argument still. If this is just kinit I could create a bash alias, but more Kerberos tools appear to try my local username. For example Kredentials does not allow me to use another than default principal.\nSo, basically, what I want is to create a mapping between the local user gert and the remote principal gertvdijk@GERT.LAN.\nIronically, when using a more complicated setup with PAM I am able to achieve this. In krb5.conf:\n[appdefaults]\n        pam = {\n                mappings = gert gertvdijk@GERT.LAN\n        }\n\nBut I don't want to use the Kerberos PAM module anymore since I've locked out myself so many times by thinking the Kerberos server isn't reachable and I'm trying to enter the local password...\nSo, long story short, is there a way to configure a default principal or a mapping from local usernames?\n\nA: The default principal can be set in ~/.k5identity\n$ cat .k5identity\nuser@EXAMPLE.COM\n\nThen kinit will use it as a default identity.\n\nA: Use a default realm and use a user mapping in your /etc/krb5.conf like this:\n[libdefaults]\n    default_realm = GERT.LAN\n\n[realms]\n    GERT.LAN = {\n        auth_to_local_names = {\n            gert = gert.vandijk\n        }\n    }\n\nNow kinit/kpasswd will map this when invoking it as the local user and map that to a domain username.\n\nA: I belive currently there is no solution for that. From the kinit man page:\nkinit obtains and caches an initial ticket-granting ticket for principal.\nIf principal is absent, kinit chooses an appropriate principal name based\non existing credential cache contents or the local username of the user in‐\nvoking kinit. Some options modify the choice of principal name.\n\n\nmeaning you have to use an option at least once at the first time, later the user from the existing (but may be expired) ticket will be used.\nBut at least you can have a workaround for it, like:\nalias kinit='/usr/bin/kinit $KRB_USER'\n\nwhich falls back to the original in case the KRB_USER is not defined.\n", "Q: How can I change the color of Ubuntu Touch ToolBar?

(Let reinstalling be last possible solution, because i have my good programs created and stored in ubuntu:(....)  \n\nA: The first thing I usually do in such \"surprising\" situations is to boot the box from a live CD.

Brightness control has no effect what so ever over the screen brightness, and because I've had some major issues in the past when I was trying to fiddle with nVidia drivers and settings, and I wanna be cautious now. I haven't find similar questions referring 14.04 LTS with similar configuration as mine. \nI've read that it could be fixed by adding/changing content in xorg.conf but when I run\nsudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nthe file comes out to be absolutely empty. What do I need to do, what do I need to add to it and not get my laptop screwed with a black screen again?\n\nA: For those of you having this problem with an Intel card, look at this fix: \nYou can see whether you use an Intel card with the following command. If you see \"intel_backlight\", you probably have an Intel card.\nls /sys/class/backlight/\n\nIf so, execute the following command:\nsudo touch /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\n\nYou may check first if that file exists, but touching it won't do any harm. Then edit the file:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\n\nInsert the following code:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"card0\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSave the file, log out, log back in. This worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04, and it should work on 13.10 as well. \nCredits to It's FOSS\n\nA: This worked for my Lenovo T530 with Nvidia/Intel...\nNote. My BIOS graphics settings were changed from Nvidia Optimus to Discrete Graphics (this was so I can drive a 4K external monitor from the Display Port). Also no need to have the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf on your system. The following assumes you are running the Nvidia driver and have access to the NVIDIA X Server Settings app in Unity.\nFirst, bring up the text editor and I'll show you how to add the right contents to this file for your graphics card.\ngksu gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf\n\nIf your file is empty as mine was then open up the app \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\" from Unity.\nThen go to the \"X Server Display Configuration\" section. \nAt the bottom of the screen click the button \"Save to X Configuration\". We don't want to actually save anything here, but click on the \"Show Preview\" button.\nScroll through until you see Section \"Device\" and the following EndSection.

Mine looked like this:\nSection \"Device\"\n   Identifier     \"Device0\"\n   Driver         \"nvidia\"\n   VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n   BoardName      \"NVS 5400M\"\nEndSection\n\nPaste this into the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf file opened before.\nNow paste the following line just before the EndSection \nOption        \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\n\nIt should look like this:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"NVS 5400M\"\n    Option         \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nEndSection\n\nNow save and close /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf and reboot. My brightness control now works. Got the idea from this related post.\n\nA: Is it that the brightness control doesn't persist or is it that modifying it has no effect? \nI have had issues where changing brightness control didn't persist across reboots. I have a Dell XPS L502X with an integrated Intel and a GeForce GT 540M graphics card. I use xbacklight to overcome the problem. Install the package with \nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nand use the following command to set the brightness, say\nxbacklight -set 20%\n\nIf you want to automate this, you can add this to \"Startup Applications\", so that every time your computer starts, the brightness would be set to 20%.\n\nA: Run sudo nvidia-xconfig to generate the xorg.conf file.\nI am having the same issue, however even after setting the DWord in xorg.conf the brightness is not changing. \n", "Q: guvc video capture commandline I know how to use the -h option, I just don't see any commands to start video capture with file incrementation unless I press the video capture button.\nWhat is the command line to start video capture guvcview using filename incrementation.\nThe option -n, --video=FILENAME Video File name (capture from start) will start video capture, however, the filename is overwritten unless the gui capture button is used. \n\nA: In order to run guvcview capture from command line you need to send a SIGUSR1 signal to the running application.

As a workaround, you can use this script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsleep 10\nxrandr --output DVI-D-0 --mode 1920x1080 \necho \"Script was run\" \n\nThe sleep is needed to make sure that the Desktop Environment has finished starting before the script is run. That way, you know that it will be run after the DE has reconfigured your screens. Make the script executable and add it to your startup applications. That should do the trick.\n\nA: I had the same problem. While using Optimus Manager (alternative to NVIDIA Prime), i was playing a game normally. I changed some in-game graphic settings and it crashed, due to which i had to reboot linux and then the resolution changed as soon i logged in ( after the login screen). I spend endless time fixing it using xrandr and other stuffs but failed. I later found out nvidia-settings and optimus-manager generates its own xorg.conf.\nSo a quick and efficient solution was very simple and was as follows:\nDelete: \n\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nDelete unnecessary configuration files: \n\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n\ne.g: \n\n10-optimus-manager.conf\n\nI then rebooted and all became back to normal.\n", "Q: ssh server: allow only login with key I know, this question has been ask several times.

pretty much every upgrade I have done.  It has never done this before.\nOne common suggestion is to disable all third-party ppas.    I uncheck them and hit OK and try the upgrade.   When I open up the Software and Updates window after trying the Upgrade, all the ppas are checked again. \nAnything pop out at someone?  I haven't loaded most of the apps it says are broken..with the exception of xserver.  I just do all recommended updates when they come up. Xserver I have pretty much gotten working with trial and error.\n\nA: I found the answer.  The first answer looked a lot like my post.  I found it Unable to upgrade to 14.04 as well as referred to in at least one other post.\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-all\n\nand that did it.  Thanks to Ubuntu 14.04 upgrade from 13.10 I next ran this:\nsudo apt-get  update\nsudo apt-get  upgrade\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nand a few others from the top 7, 10, 14 things you should do sites. I even have an NVIDIA splash screen now!\n", "Q: Some keys are not detected in my keyboard (multimedia keys?) by either xev or xbindkeys or keytouch: how to detect them? It is one more attempt to get Fn keys to volume up/down, brightness, etc. working. Those controls are simply not working in my non-branded ultrabook.\nI want to detect them to modify /home/username/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml, as the following doesn't seem working:\n<keybind key=\"XF86AudioRaiseVolume\">\n    <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>amixer -q sset Master 3%+ unmute</command>\n\nNeither xev nor xbindkeys nor keytouch are detecting when I press volumen up or brightness down, for example. The start/stop touchpad button is working, but is not detected by those applications either.\nI also tried with dconf-editor as it is suggested here. next was already set to XF86AudioNext (and it is active)\nHere, I read the following explanation:\n\nSome laptop Fn key combinations are multimedia keys\n  (appearing to the OS as ordinary keys with nonstandard codes), while\n  others trigger ACPI events that eventually reach the OS, and some are\n  just handled by the BIOS and never seen by the OS. The information\n  paths are explained on the\n  Hotkeys/Architecture\n  page on the Ubuntu wiki, complete with diagrams.\nIf the OS can't see anything when you press the brightness keys, it\n  could be because they're handled directly by the BIOS. The battle is\n  not completely lost — it is in principle possible to hack the BIOS —\n  but the difficulty level is considerably raised.\n\nAny idea? \n\nA: You may need acpi support\nsudo apt-get install acpi acpi-support acpica-tools acpid acpidump acpitail acpitool libacpi0 laptop-detect pommed\n\nBeyond installing the above packages, I finally fixed this issue on my laptop by uninstalling the toshet package after discovering my specific model was not compatible or supported by the toshet application. I doubt you have toshet installed but you can check to see by typing the following command:\ndpkg -l | grep toshet\n\nThere should be no output if toshet is not installed. If it is listed in the subsequent output of that command, you can uninstall it by typing the following:\nsudo apt-get purge toshet \n\n", "Q: Strange USB (phone) behavior I have 12.04LTS on a Dell Inspiron laptop, and it behaves very strangely when I plug my Samsung Galaxy SII phone into it.\nWhen I connect the phone, I get three dialog boxes, one says \"Unable to mount SAMSUNG_Androit...Error initializing Camera: -60 could not lock device\" Then the other two are the typical \"You have just inserted a digital audio player...\" asking what to do (there are two I think because there are effectively two SD cards in the phone, one \"built-in\" and one plugged into it.\nAnyway, if I ask one of the dialogs to go to the files, I see two devices with the little eject icons beside them, a bunch of folders, and a couple of files. However, if I try to look inside anything, it appears empty (not true, in case it needs saying!)\nAlso, if I run the mount command, that doesn't show the device(s) anywhere, and if I use the command line to do \"cd /media ; ls -a\" the media location is empty.\nIf I plug the same phone, with the same cable, onto another machine running Ubuntu 13.10, it works just fine. One device shows up, with two subfolders, and those folders (representing the two SD cards in the phone) all contain their regular data. It also shows up under mount and ls /media in the way I would expect.\nOh, one more thing.

Ubuntu on a Crucial SSD, fantastic! But will never use 120 Gigs or even half that. After years of SSD writes (and subsequent SSD corruption), does an utility exist to copy the entire operating system and all files over to the unused portion of the SSD?\nMy understanding is the SSD degrades in activity areas, where it is being used and written to. But at least half of the SSD never used, and will never be used, and so remains in new pristine condition.\nCan the lifetime of the SSD be doubled by copying the first 60 Gigs (where Ubuntu and everything resides) over to the last never-used 60 Gigs? Then those first 60 Gigs would be erased, and set aside as a new partition. And Ubuntu now runs on the equivalent of a new SSD, those last 60 Gigs. The utility would then need to prevent any future usage or writes to that first 60 Gig partition of the SSD where Ubuntu had formerly resided.\n\nA: Solid-state drives are not like regular mechanical hard drives in the sense that you can partition the drive to keep data for certain partitions in a specific physical area of the drive platters. You cannot write to a specific memory address on the SSD, like you can with RAM.\nThe SSD controller will distribute data across all of the available memory on the drive. If it did not, the drive would quickly wear out specific blocks of memory, since each piece of memory can only be written to a few thousand times (depending on the type of memory). This feature is called wear leveling.\nIn your case, you are thinking about over-provisioning. Solid-state drives do this from the factory, you might have 256GB of memory chips on a drive, but only 240GB of it is available. The leftover memory is called spare area. The more spare area you have, the higher-performing and longer-lasting your drive will be. Of course, the trade off is that you end up with less storage capacity.\nIf you are never going to fill up your 120GB drive, you an do one of two things: First, just leave it alone and let the SSD controller take care of it. If you never fill the drive, it will use wear-leveling to distribute writes across all of the available memory. Second, you could partition the drive to say, 100GB, and then you would have 20GB additional spare area. In this case, you could fill the drive up and not worry about compromising it's performance because you have the extra 20GB of memory for the SSD controller to use.\n\nA: You can find a lot of information on the Easy Linux Tips Project. Basically what you call the \"unused portion of ssd\" may not really make sense as the system tries to use (or recycle) the whole disk in a periodic way so that each part gets a uniform number of writes in the long run. This is called wear leveling.\n\nA: Over the lifespan of your drive (not that you'll actually use it enough to achieve this), parts of it will become bad.  Your operating system and SSD are capable of detecting these failures and preventing writes to bad blocks/sectors.\nThe best thing you can do is make sure your operating system and SSD are doing their jobs correctly.\nMost people, when talking about SSD wear, over-think and create non-existing problems for themselves. \n", "Q: Issue with multiple monitors (one is detected as built in, the other isn't detected) I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04 (first time using it so I am pretty clueless) and I can't get my two monitors to be detected.

Can I recover old home? Previous Working System : Upgrade of 13.10 to 14.04 with /home on separate partition. \nThis worked fine after I removed my second graphic board. \nReinstall After some weeks I decided to do a fresh install but chickened out when I saw the option to reinstall keeping documents, music etc. So I chose reinstall. This worked but left me with a new /home directory. \nThe old /home directory is present on another partition.  How can I set up so this is recognised?  \n\nA: The answer depends on whether you want to keep the separate partition for /home or you are fine with having everything on one partition (assuming your \"new /home directory\" is not on a separate partition).\nIf one big partition is okay or your new /home is on an additional new partition, then do this:\nCopy the files from the old home to the new one, log out and back in (so settings you made in files you copied back get applied) and delete the old home afterwards.\nThere are lots and lots of ways to copy those files, probably just using the file manager would work if you set it to display hidden files and copy those too. Other ways include \"cp\" and \"rsync\" (see their manpages).\nDeleting the old /home partition could be done using \"gparted\" (easiest) or various other tools.\nIf you want to keep the separate old partition, then you need to edit your /etc/fstab file so the partition is automatically mounted to /home at boot. Afterwards the unwanted new /home directory is hidden behind the other one, or you can delete it.\nFor information on how to edit that file, look at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\n", "Q: touchpad won't respond immediately This is more of a pet-peeve item, but I recently updated from Ubuntu 13.10 to Ubuntu 14.04, and it looks great, but my touchpad is a bit \"sticky\".

I want to upgrade but I´m afraid that all my data will be erased, and I cant make a data backup because I don´t have the needed hardware.\n\nA: You should always backup your files. If you don't backup them, you don't value them and sooner or later you will lose them.\nBut no, they won't be erased if everything goes well during the upgrade.\nNone of your installed applications or of your settings should be lost either - you'll just get newer versions of your programs. Before the upgrade procedure removes any package which it thinks you don't need anymore it will ask whether it should.\nAfterwards you'll pretty much have the same system as before, with small changes and newer versions of most software.\n", "Q: Notepad doesn't open files created by Gedit? I'm using c/c++ compiler on Ubuntu 14.04 and I've typed all the programs using Gedit text editor.\nBut the problem is that now I need to open them in Windows 8 with Notepad, but when I tried to open .c files that are created in Ubuntu in Notepad they are displaying like a paragraph but not line by line.\nSo I need the programs to be displayed line by line as in Gedit . The only method I found was to edit each and every line in the program as to be displayed as line by line.\n\nA: It's true that Notepad is not a good editor and that it's basically Notepad's fault. But the actual problem is this:\nLine ends are stored differently among operating systems. Unix (Ubuntu) usually use the symbol \"LF\" and Windows (Notepad too, because of that) \"CR+LF\".\nYou can set the line ends to CR+LF in Gedit (you need to search the option yourself, you should find it somewhere) and Notepad will be happy.\nBut in the long term you'll be happier with Notepad++ or I think Geany runs on Windows too.\n\nA: Notepad is not a good editor.\nTry to use Notepad++ the code should be displayed correctly.\n\nA: As suggested by @giuseppe and @Nobidy, notepad++ is the best choice.

However, you can accomplish your goal using one of these two methods:\nCreate a Recipe\nIf you are building a package from a branch on Launchpad and you have Debian packaging, create a daily build recipe that targets the Ubuntu releases you wish to support. This is described in more detail in the latter half of this answer.\nThis is really the best solution since it also automates new builds every time you make a change (with a limit on one automatic build per day, although you can manually dispatch additional builds).\nUpload Multiple Builds Manually\nThis is not an ideal solution - but it works. What you need to do to make this work is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adjust the version number in the changelog to match this format:\n[version]-1ppa1~[release]1\n\n...where [version] is the package version and [release] is an Ubuntu release codename (like trusty, saucy, etc.).\n\n*Make sure the changelog is set to build the correct release. In other words, for Trusty, the first line of your changelog should look like this:\nffc (1.3.20140513-1ppa1~trusty1) trusty; urgency=medium\n\nUpload the package using dput and then repeat the two steps above for each release you want to upload packages for.

After uploading the OVF appliance to our server we can then import it to virtual box running there simply with:\nVBoxManage import <name>.ovf [--dry-run] [<options>]\n\nThe option --dry-run will give you information on how the appliance will be imported, and you will also see further options on how to influence this.\n\nA: You should look at the VirtualBox documentation, it may be possible to do what you want from the command line, but I don't think it will be a straight forward process.\nThe easiest would probably be to tunnel X through SSH: Just log in with ssh -X and you can open graphical programs - their window will open on your local computer.\nFor console only access qemu would probably better suited because it's actually supposed to be used on the command line.\n", "Q: Wifi is disabled and Network applet's \"Enable Wfi\" is not clickable Every time in Network settings, Airplane mode switches on itself.\nOn running nmcli nm in terminal:\nRUNNING : running          \nSTATE : connected           \nWIFI-HARDWARE : disabled   \nWIFI : disabled          \nWWAN-HARDWARE : enabled  \nWWAN : enabled\n\nI don't know how to enable WIFI-HARDWARE and WIFI.\nAlso using \"sudo rfkill unblock wifi\" is not working.\nI also checked the output of rfkill list: \n0: phy0: Wireless LAN   \nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: yes\n\n\nA: \n\nHard blocked: yes \n\n\nrefers to the fact that there is a physical key combination or other button disabling your wifi.\nIn my case I had to click [Fn] + [F11]\nand on my other laptop there is a toggle button on the left side I had to slide.\n", "Q: starting a terminal in desktop (ubuntu 14.04) Anyone know how to start a (Linux) terminal in Ubuntu 14.04 desktop?

It seems this image does not exist for 14.04. I have found the image for 14.10, but I would prefer to use a LTS edition. Does anyone know where I can find this image?\n\nA: The Mac .iso files existed for saucy (releases.ubuntu.com/saucy), but do not appear to to exist for trusty (releases.ubuntu.com/trusty).\nDid the Mac specific elements get merged with the standard 32 and 64bit versions? \n\nFurther Research:\nsee response to: What is different about the Mac ISO image?\n\nIn Ubuntu 10.10, we changed the normal amd64 CD images to dual-boot on either BIOS or UEFI systems (UEFI, \"Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\", is a different kind of firmware found on many newer systems). This was done using a technique known as a \"multi-catalog\" CD - it contains two boot images, and the specification says that the firmware is supposed to pick the one it can best use.\nUnfortunately, even though Macs use a variant of EFI (an earlier version of what's now called UEFI), they apparently can't cope with multi-catalog CDs, and simply refuse to boot them. This left us in rather a quandary: we needed to support UEFI systems, but we didn't want to drop support for Macs either. I therefore created the amd64+mac CD images, which are exactly the same as the amd64 images except that they only support BIOS booting. Macs are happy to boot these in their BIOS emulation mode.\n(In fact, the name amd64+mac is a slight misnomer, because it later turned out that some systems other than Macs suffer from a similar problem - but I felt that a more technically accurate naming such as amd64+nouefi would be more likely to confuse than enlighten.)\n\nThis blog From an Egg > How to install Ubuntu on a Mac or Macbook also suggests using the standard iso files.\n\nDownload Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr. .. Be sure you download the iso which does NOT have ‘+mac’ in the filename. This is for older Apple computers.\n\nAnd finally this Kubuntu support thread Why is there no longer a +mac .iso available for download? gives a similar explanation:\n\n.. there was some overlap with the OS X versions, the late 10.4.x thru 10.7.5 works with early intel mac's 32-bit EFI, but otherwise 64-bit systems. (those mac's would boot thru the 32-bit EFI, and run the 64-bit kernal). Apple sold these as \"Fully\" 64-bit machines, when in fact they were limited by the EFI used, when confronted Apple downplayed it. They built in obsolescence in two areas one the EFI, the second graphics cards. Both issues can be worked around on the MacPro's. \n\nConclusion:\nYou should be using the standard 64bit (or 32bit) image, unless you are using an older model.\n\nA: To install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a mac go here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nHowever that site appears to have broken links so here is a direct link to the .iso file:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso\nif you prefer torrent (which is a safer habbit) here is the link\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso.torrent\nTHE ABOVE FILES ARE WHAT I USED FOR MY Macbook Pro and worked successfully\nMy model is the Macbook Pro 2008 Original, read the other answer also.. it may help you.\n\nA: iso files with the +mac in their file names for 14.04 can be found here:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/\nThe old direct links to files in that location are broken because they point to 14.04 files instead of 14.04.3 or 14.04.4, which replaced that older version.

The download always fails because the connection times out. It is not a problem with the ubuntu archives as I have tried several and also get the same problem with all other third party archives. However, the internet connection from the Ubuntu server works fine as I can ping from it successfully and connect into it from outside with SSH or to the Web server it is running. The guest Linux machine has a static IP and uses the external Hyper-V connection that I have set up for all other guest OSs running on the host. It seems that the Linux guest can make outgoing icmp connections to the Internet (which is why I get correct ping results) but cannot receive communications to complete the connection. Without apt-get working I cannot do anything with this guest server.\n\nA: This question is pretty old, but my guess would be that you're not getting DNS resolution.

You'll want at least 1GB RAM for Ubuntu. If you have that, then Ubuntu should be a good match. If you have less, then you might want to get Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\nBut in either case, when you're replacing an opeating system, I recommend that you take some time to explore alternatives.

Is there a linuxsoftware suitable for this? Unfortunately VLC doesn't let me do that.\n\nA: For actual scrubbing through a video, i.e. advancing frame by frame, this can be done with vlc. The feature can be accessed by pressing the 'e' key or using the button marked 'Frame by Frame' under View --> Advanced controls, then using the screenshot capabilities of vlc which by default can be activated by using  Shift+s. As far as I can see this will not run backwards though.\nThere are a few other non-scrubbing options with MPlayer and FFmpeg. MPlayer is capable of outputting images either automatically or manually from a video clip and perhaps this would be helpful.

This message occurs when leaving the Grub menu and before the Ubuntu splash screen.\nHow do I fix the problem to clear the message?\nAnd what doe is it mean?\nerror:  Diskfilter writes are not supported\n\nSystem boots and seems to work just fine.\n\nA: I think this error occur because of raid or LVM partition .\nFor a temporary fix for this problem  :\nEdit :/etc/grub.d/10_linux \nReplace 'quick_boot=\"1\"' with 'quick_boot=\"0\"'\nThen :\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: It's a BUG!\nThis is a bug that occurs in the most recent version of Ubuntu Server LTS (Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS), when you create the boot partition (or the root partition, when the boot partition doesn't exists) inside a LVM or a RAID partition.\nYou can get more info about this bug in Ubuntu Launchpad: Bug #1274320 \"Error: diskfilter writes are not supported\".\nUpdate: This bug is already fixed in Ubuntu Server 14.04 and some newer Ubuntu versions. Probably, you only need to run apt-get upgrade.\nWhy does this bug occur?\nWhen the system is booting, GRUB reads (load_env) data in /boot/grub/grubenv. This file is called GRUB Environment Block.\nFrom the GRUB Manual:\n\nIt is often useful to be able to remember a small amount of information from one boot to the next.\n[...]\nAt boot time, the load_env command (see load_env) loads environment variables from it, and the save_env (see save_env) command saves environment variables to it.\n[...]\ngrub-mkconfig uses this facility to implement GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT\n\nThis behavior can be founded in /etc/grub.d/00_header (update-grub uses this file to generate the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file):\nif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ]; then\n  set have_grubenv=true\n  load_env\nfi\n\nThe problem is that the save_env statement only works in simple installations (you can't run save_env inside a RAID or LVM disk). From the GRUB manual:\n\nFor safety reasons, this storage is only available when installed on a plain disk (no LVM or RAID), using a non-checksumming filesystem (no ZFS), and using BIOS or EFI functions (no ATA, USB or IEEE1275).\n\nThe GRUB recordfail feature uses the save_env statement to update the recordfail state (see Ubuntu Help - Grub 2, \"Last Boot Failed or Boot into Recovery Mode\" section). However, in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in recent Debian versions), the save_env statement (inside the recordfail feature) is used even if GRUB is installed in a LVM or a RAID.\nLet's see the lines from 104 to 124 in /etc/grub.d/00_header:\nif [ \"$quick_boot\" = 1 ]; then\n    [...]\n    case \"$FS\" in\n      btrfs | cpiofs | newc | odc | romfs | squash4 | tarfs | zfs)\n    cat <<EOF\n  # GRUB lacks write support for $FS, so recordfail support is disabled.\n  [...]\n  if [ -n \"\\${have_grubenv}\" ]; then if [ -z \"\\${boot_once}\" ]; then save_env recordfail; fi; fi\n\nGRUB correctly skips the recordfail feature when using unsupported filesystems (btrfs, zfs, etc), but it doesn't skip LVM and RAID at any moment.\nHow does GRUB protect itself from writing inside RAID and LVM?\nTo read/write correctly in a filesystems, GRUB loads an appropriate module.\nGRUB uses the diskfilter module (insmod diskfilter) in RAID partitions, and the lvm module in LVM partitions.\nLet's see the read/write implementation of the diskfilter module:\napt-get source grub2\nvim grub2-2.02~beta2/grub-core/disk/diskfilter.c\n\nI'm pasting the code here (lines from 808 to 823). The warning showed in this question appears at line 821:\nstatic grub_err_t\ngrub_diskfilter_read (grub_disk_t disk, grub_disk_addr_t sector,\n                  grub_size_t size, char *buf)\n{\n  return read_lv (disk->data, sector, size, buf);\n}\n\nstatic grub_err_t\ngrub_diskfilter_write (grub_disk_t disk __attribute ((unused)),\n             grub_disk_addr_t sector __attribute ((unused)),\n             grub_size_t size __attribute ((unused)),\n             const char *buf __attribute ((unused)))\n{\n  return grub_error (GRUB_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET,\n                 \"diskfilter writes are not supported\");\n}\n\nThe grub_diskfilter_read function is implemented (and GRUB can read RAID filesystems). However, the grub_diskfilter_write function raises a GRUB_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET error.\nWhy does using quick_boot=0 solve the problem? And why is it the wrong solution?\nIf you look one more time in the /etc/grub.d/00_header code, you will see that the recordfail featured is only used when quick_boot=1. So, changing quick_boot from 1 to 0 disables the recordfail feature, and disables writes in the RAID/LVM partition.\nHowever, it'll disable many other features too (run grep \\$quick_boot /etc/grub.d/* and you'll see). More yet, if one day you change your /boot/grub directory to outside the RAID/LVM, the recordfail feature will still disabled.\nSummarily, this solution unnecessarily disables features, and it's not generic.\nWhat is the correct solution?\nThe correct solution should consider disable the save_env statements when GRUB is inside LVM or RAID partitions.\nOne patch was proposed in the Debian Bug Tracker system to implement this solution. It can be found in: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=754921\nThe idea behind this patch is:\n\n*\n\n*Run a grub-probe --target=abstraction \"${grubdir}\" command to get what kind of abstraction modules GRUB uses to read/write files in the /boot/grub directory;\n\n*If GRUB uses the diskfilter or lvm module, skip the recordfail save_env statement and write an appropriated comment in the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file;\n\n*\n\n*For example, # GRUB lacks write support for /dev/md0, so recordfail support is disabled.\nHow to apply the correct solution?\nIf you don't want to wait for this patch be applied by the Ubuntu/Debian guys in the official code, you can use my patched 00_header:\n# Download\nwget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rarylson/da6b77ad6edde25529b2/raw/99f266a10e663e1829efc25eca6eddb9412c6fdc/00_header_patched\n# Apply\nmv /etc/grub.d/00_header /etc/grub.d/00_header.orig\nmv 00_header_patched /etc/grub.d/00_header\n# Disable the old script and enable the new one\nchmod -x /etc/grub.d/00_header.orig\nchmod +x /etc/grub.d/00_header\n# Update Grub\nupdate-grub\n\n", "Q: Black screen with blinking cursor after dual boot install 14.04 I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my toshiba laptop along side Windows 7.\nWhen the menu comes up to choose which OS to boot into, I can easily boot into Windows 7.\nI cannot successfully boot into Ubuntu.

What's obvious to someone writing the program may not be so obvious to those trying to use it.\nAnyway, to find its proper location I managed to find some clues in the uninstall portion of the instructions.

Alternatively Finder will now have mounted a disk called EFI in your Devices list on the left-hand-side, so you can click on that and browse to EFI/refind.\nGoogling for the answer found this page so hopefully this little snippet of info will be useful for others trying to track it down.\n\nA: If you installed with the --ownhfs option, then refind.conf will be in the System/Library/CoreServices directory on the partition you specified with --ownhfs.\nNote that rEFInd auto-detects boot loaders, so if you really want to never use GRUB again, another option is to delete the grubx64.efi file from wherever it was installed (probably your ESP).\n\nA: If installed via OSX: \nsudo mountesp \nThe terminal will then tell you where to look, typically /Volumes/ESP\nFrom there you can find refind.conf at:\n/Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind/refind.conf\nFrom the rEFInd author:\n\nSince 0.9.3, rEFInd has provided a script called mountesp, which\n  locates and mounts the ESP. Open a Terminal and type sudo mountesp to\n  mount the ESP. The program should tell you where it's mounted the ESP.\n  It will remain mounted until you manually unmount it or until you\n  reboot.\n\n\nA: Don't run:\nmkdir /Volumes/esp\n\nInstead use: \ndiskutil mount /dev/disk0s1\n\nGo to finder and you will see it in: EFI>EFI>refind>refind.conf\nPS: make sure to edit it with sudo.\n", "Q: Typing my network password without keyboard I have a device with only one USB port (BeagleBone Black), and I would like to connect to a WiFi network on it.

Was wondering how I could shrink my Windows partition on my dual boot setup, considering I no longer need much space for it. I've heard of gparted, not sure if that is fit for the job.\nThanks!\n\nA: First off, shrinking the windows partition from ubuntu can lead to corrupted data, loss of said data, and inability to boot from the shrunk partition. Back up any data you do not want to lose and continue.\nMy recommendation is to shrink the windows partition from the windows itself. Should that not be possible, for whatever reason,\nLet me state this again: THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. IT IS VERY EASY TO DESTROY DATA AND CORRUPT THE PARTITION BEING SHRUNK! BACK UP YOUR FILES BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS!\nBut the correct tool to use on Ubuntu 13.10 and back is Gparted. On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Gparted is not installed by default, but can be found in the Software Center. Install Gparted (or make sure it is installed), and continue\nAgain, DOING THIS MAY CORRUPT DATA OR BREAK THE PARTITION! MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP YOUR FILES FIRST!\nAll you need to do is unmount the disk and resize the partition, then save the changes. Then, expand the Ubuntu partition to fill the new space. Make sure you leave extra space on the partition you are shrinking,  or else things are going to get ugly.\n\nA: Its not a good idea to shrink Windows C: partition from Ubuntu. Your windows might have some issues and might not boot after. Its better to shrink it in windows. You can use Disk managment or softwares like Mini tool partition wizard. \n\nA: *\n\n*Download ubuntu 14.04 and create a live usb.\n\n*Boot to a live desktop and run gparted.\n\n*You will see a window with your your drive displayed as a bar graph with different colors in it. click on them and find the NTFS one.\n\n*Hit the Delete key if you want to delete windows, otherwise resize it to whatever you want to. (if resizing windows, boot to it first and uninstall stuff, move media files off it and defrag)\n\n*Go to edit and click apply all operations... be VERY sure it is your NTFS windows partition.\n\n*After it is done, you will be able to resize the ubuntu partition, just resize it, apply operations, then go have a coffee or something because it might be a little while.\n\n*After all that is done, shutdown/reboot and you should be good.\n\n", "Q: File recovery of windows after installing ubuntu In one of my computers I  installed ubuntu 14.04. Actually , I tried to dual-boot in along with windows 7 and I tried to do the partition during the ubuntu installation procedure. \nNow all of my 500 GB hard disk has been occupied by ubuntu and I cannot access windows. Since, I have all my documents in windows and I want to recover it. Will I be able to recovery my files of windows ? If yes, can you please help me with the solution ?\n\nA: You must be aware of these facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to preserve the disk space you have, otherwise you will loose the recoverable portion\n\n*You can use a powerful tool called photorec to recover your files.\n\n*The files must be recovered to a another storage device.\n\n\nHere is a tutorial on how to use photorec.\n", "Q: How to apply patch to Ableton 9 Live Suite (.auz file)? I'm just getting started with Ubuntu here, so please bear with me :)\nI installed Ableton 9 Live Suite using PlayOnLinux, and I cannot apply the patch. The patch maker I downloaded generates a .auz file and I haven't been able to apply nor dragging it to Ableton nor through Terminal.\nThis is what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dragging the file: it rejects it saying the authorization file is not valid on this computer (or system, I'm not sure what term it uses, I'm running this in Spanish).\nI've tried running Ableton using Wine and not through PlayOnLinux, but no go.\n\n*Terminal:\nwine ableton 9 live suite.exe \"c:\\programdata\\ableton\\live 9 suite\\program\\authorize.auz\"\n\nThe ableton exe file is located in:\n.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/AbletonLive9/drive_c/users/Public/Application Data/Ableton/Live 9 Suite/Program\n\nand the reply I get is:\nwine: cannot find L\"C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\ableton.exe\n\n\nA: The only working way is to use PlayOnLinux.\nInstall Ableton (in win7 mode via configure wine). You can open it in trial mode to download the factory pack. close it.\nNow install a non listed application in PlayOnLinux select the ableton 9 drive location and launch the patch.\nPatch the ableton exe (it will ask for the file location) and explore the ~/PlayOnLinux's virtual drives/AbletonLive9/drive_c/ProgramData/Ableton/Live 9 Suite/Program/ directory to find the .auz file (keep this folder opened)\nOpen ableton from PlayOnLinux, drag and drop the auz file and wait.\nAbleton will register normally.\nBeware of update preferences in ableton. By default it's set to auto update. Untick the automatic update will help.\nYou must create a folder in your abletonlive9 drive C to export your projects or ableton will crash when saving a project.\n\nA: I had this exact problem yesterday.\nSteps that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new 64-bit Wine prefix using Winetricks and install Gecko and Mono.\n\n*In the winetricks window, select default Wineprefix.\n\n*Under install a component or Windows DLL, install all the Visual C++ packages up to 2015 and Quicktime72.\n\n*Install Ableton Live 9, and then turn off automatic updates or usage data. (Block ABL in a firewall like ufw if you want to be very thorough).\n\n*Decompress PatchIO, and move it to .wine/drive_c/ProgramData/Ableton/Program or whatever it is where the executable for Ableton lives in your wine prefix.\n\n*Close Ableton, then run the PatchIO.exe.\n\n*Reopen Ableton and the authorization window should come up.\n\n*Click 'No Internet on this Computer' in the lower left corner of the window.\n\n*Some instructions appear on this page; Drag the Authorization.auz file into the middle of this window. \n\n*There should be a dialog box that says that you're authorized. \nDragging it onto the app icon or piping it into the app from the command line does not seem to work under Wine.

I can't run a back up as my Ubuntu 12.04 is corrupted and is not booting. So just before installing, I want to ask, what will happen to my files?\nI am running Ubuntu as a trial version. I am booting it directly from the drive.\n\nA: I think if you install 14.04 alongside 12.04 your files will still be on the other partition, and you may be able to access them.  I can access the files on my Windows partition from Ubuntu, but it might be different having 2 Ubuntu operating systems.\n\nA: You can perfectly use the live .iso and select the option to upgrade, your personal files will be preserved and you just need to enter your previous credentials (user, password) if you want to use the same home directory, it applies to both unencrypted and encrypted home.\nBackups are always good idea.\n\nA: This applies if your home folder is not encrypted. Boot from the Ubuntu 14.04 live USB/CD and mount your Ubuntu 12.04 partition, You can move them to the other partitions or any backup media you use. After moving all your files from the Ubuntu 12.04 partition (make sure you have no important files left), open GParted and delete the Ubuntu 12.04 partition and create it as a new partition and install 14.04 in it.\nInstalled programs can't be recovered.\nI hope that helps.\n\nA: You can create two partitions on your pen drive. The first partition is for booting the Ubuntu installer and the second partition for storing your files. Or you can prepare one pen drive for booting the Ubuntu installer and prepare one flash drive or your phone memory if it is big enough for your file.\nBoot the Ubuntu installer. Don't install it, just try it, and then open the file manager and browse your hard drive and copy all your files you want to keep to your flash drive, phone memory, or anything else you can mount on your PC.\nThen unmount your hard drive so you can run the installation and do the full installation so you have one Ubuntu OS, not two. I hope this helps. ;)\n\nA: *\n\n*Just decrease the size of /dev/sda3 ext3 partition through gparted partition editor and create a new ext4 partition from that unallocated space.\n\n*Now run the Ubuntu installer and choose something else option to install Ubuntu 14.04 on the newly created ext4 partition.\n", "Q: Distro question - Which (current) linux distro works well with older laptops I'm sorry, but this is going to be somewhat vague for now. I'll update this within 24 hours with more details, or as soon as they are available. Whichever comes first.\nI am enrolled in an engineering class that requires a year-end presentation. My presentation is a couple weeks out, and I've just hit a roadblock. My previous plan was to haul in and hook up my desktop, but school policy changed and I'm not allowed to do that any more. Instead, my dad has allowed me to use an old laptop for my presentation.\nHowever, this is where the problems begin. His laptop is an XP machine. The software I need for my presentation is PowerPoint (or Libreoffice Impress), Logger Pro (I have the .deb packages), and a couple more programs that I wrote, that will ONLY work on Linux.\nMy dad has a Dell Vostro 1500, which was released in 2007. Specs are here\nHe is offering me the laptop he used for a couple years before that, so something probably released in the 2004-2005 range. I don't have specs right now (or even know what laptop it will be, just that it was an XP box and could run CAD software).\nI am looking for a distro that has/can/is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run LibreOffice\n\n*Install Debian Packages\n\n*Run Scripts that can listen to hardware\n\n*Minimal system footprint\n\n*Preferably Debian or Ubuntu based, as I have experience with these distros\n\n\nIf the older laptop works, what would be a good candidate for a distro that can do the above, while using minimal memory?\nIf the older laptop does not work, what distro could do the above on a Dell Vostro 1500 (specs, again) quickly and efficiently?\nI am aware of options such as Puppy Linux and Tiny Core Linux, but those are not good options. While they run fast, my scripts need something based off of Ubuntu or Debian to run and display correctly.\nUPDATE: The older laptop cannot be found, so I am using the Dell Vostro 1500. I have been allowed to partition the HDD, and added a 30Gb (the other partition has 10Gb free space left) partition. I installed Xubuntu (I have 2Gb of ram, and decided to capatilize on it), Logger Pro, Libreoffice, and other software I need. In fact, I am editing this from the laptop.\nSome slight issues were had with the trackpad (now THAT was fun to fix, without access to a mouse) and WiFi, but those were issues commonly had and easily fixed.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu then. These specs from your link about Dell Vostro are good enough for Ubuntu as their official page says:\nA good \"rule of thumb\" is that machines that could run XP, Vista, Windows 7 or x86 OS X will almost always be a lot faster with Ubuntu even if they are lower-spec than described below.\nSo if it can run XP, it is good for Ubuntu.\nA final recommendation can only be made after exact specs of that laptop will be known.\n\nA: If you want Ubuntu, I would recommend the Lubuntu desktop environment.  It is much simpler than the default Ubuntu desktop environment.  My brother has it on a computer with only about 700 MB of RAM, and it usually runs fine (Firefox gets pretty laggy).\n\nA: Lubuntu of Xubuntu would be my bet, though I am biased toward Xubuntu (eye candy mostly). Either one will be fine. More ram never hurt anyone though.. Have a look at the other laptop and see if it runs the same speed as the dell, if you have an open slot there, use it.\n", "Q: Changing system from stereo to mono I am trying to configure xdemorse, a morse code decoding software.

Or, for a temporary change, you can use\npacmd load-module module-remap-sink_name=mono master=alsa_output.pci.0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo channels=2 channel_map=mono,mono\n\nN.B. the second link's format is slightly different, so if this doesn't work, you can try.\npacmd load-module module-remap-sink sink_name=mono master=alsa_output.pci.0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo channels=2 channel_map=mono,mono\n\nSimilarly for the /etc/pulse/default.pa method.\n", "Q: Can't open Ubuntu I've installed the following version of Ubuntu om my machine:\nubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\n\nBut when I switch on the computer, I get the command line.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS ubuntu tty6\n\nOnce I provide my username and password, it authenticates and then displays a link to documentation.\nNow, how can I start a GUI?

I recently installed Kubuntu 14.04 on a new machine.  I did not observe the same problem with the network-manager in Ubuntu 12.04 or Debian 7.5/gnome, thus believe this pertains to Kubuntu/KDE specifically.\nThe network manager only shows a maximum of 3 \"available\" VPN connections under my wireless connection, whereas I have imported a couple of dozen.  They are accessible and configured if I click \"Edit\" but that does not allow me to connect any of the ones that are not displayed by clicking on the network manager in the GUI.  \nUnless someone has a fix, this may be a bug that needs to be reported to Kubuntu, KDE, or the maintainers of the network-manager.  I will ask first and then make the report as required.\nUPDATED: placing he mouse over the corner of the box allows resizing. Not at the bottom.  Was then able to resize. Scrolling still appears not to work, which is maybe not an optimal design, but it works!\n\nA: This was resolved by placing he mouse over the corner of the GUI box that appears when clicking on the network manager.  Only the corner in KDE apparently allows resizing, not at the bottom. Scrolling also still appears not to work, which is maybe not an optimal design.  However, this problem is avoided by using the corner of the network manager window to resize it to see remaining OVPN options.  \n", "Q: Install hangs after \"Starting CUPS printing spooler/server\" Laptop's a Clevo d900f/Sager 9280.

There are some if conditions and commands and syntaxes I have no idea what they do and I've tried Googling them but had no luck.\n\n\n*\n\n*So what does [ -z String ] do? \nFor example this appears in the script [ -z \"$(which ssh)\" ]\nAlso is $(which ssh) a string or a variable?\n\n*What does ~/.filename mean? I know that ./filename is used to execute files sometimes and that ./ its a pointer to the directory itself, but what is the ~/.?\n\n*What does [ -e  filename ] do?\n\n*What does [ ! -d ~/.ssh ] do?\n\nA: You can find more about [ by typing man [ into the terminal. This is a test construct for use after if, etc. Hence,\n   -z STRING\n          the length of STRING is zero\n   -e FILE\n          FILE exists\n   ! EXPRESSION\n          EXPRESSION is false\n   -d FILE\n          FILE exists and is a directory\n\n1) [ -z \"$(which ssh)\" ] means test if \"$(which ssh)\" is a zero-length string. $(...) means to execute the ... part first. If you run which ssh in a terminal, you'll see that it will produce the path to the shh executable, if it exists. Hence, if this exists, then the string will not be zero-length, and the test will fail.\n2) ~ is a shortcut for your home directory, usually located at /home/your_user_name. [ -e filename ] means test if this file exists, and return true if it does.\n3) [ ! -d ~/.ssh ] means test if ~/.ssh (probably /home/your_user_name/.ssh) exists and is a directory, and if it is not, then return true.\n\n==EDIT==\nYou should try and sort out the man problem, because it'll really advance your bash knowledge. If man [ doesn't work, try man test instead. (test is a synonym for [...].) If not, here is an online version. \n   -w FILE\n          FILE exists and write permission is granted\n\nI actually think you might have it the wrong way around. It should be\n[ -w \"$1\" ]\n\nnot\n[ \"$1\" -w ]\n\n", "Q: Personal Package Archive (PPA) export I plan to upgrade a machine from 12.04 to 14.04 LTS.

Now I ported it to another machine with simple 'vmlinuz' and 'initrd.img' copying and some grub config done. (Actually I am using Xen so grub config were also not required for me)\nNow for the modules, how can I copy that? Can I copy /lib/modules/(myCustomeKernelVersion) to other system plainly?\nRegarding Xen, Ubuntu official documentation for xen-create-image shows --modules option pointing to modules directory. Is it the same directory as the one mentioned above?\nNote that I am using vanilla kernel and not distribution kernel. This is required, please no question on that.\n\nA: If you are using the vanilla kernel, I would recommend building the same kernel vanilla and modules from the kernel source from the VM itself. Its may not be a good idea to use the modules compiled/available with Ubuntu as this could cause to arch / compatibility issues, panics etc. The custom kernel modules are available in /lib/modules/uname -r if the build has gone through properly.\nNote: --modules=/path/to/modules, this option is for pointing the location of the modules within the domU, similar to \"--initrd\"\n\nA: I do this all the time in my experimentation with booting Ubuntu natively on my Android devices where I need the full modules folder, system.map vmlinuz, and config. You can grab the full build, source and modules and all you have to do is open a command prompt in /lib/modules then use\nsudo zip -r your-custom-kernel-string.zip your-custom-kernel-string\n\nThen copy the zip to the place you want hold them like your desktop or home folder and chown them after that.

I have a HD5650 and it works just fine with the open source drivers. There is nothing you need to do since these are the default drivers on the system.\nNormally the closed source driver should give better 3D support ( the open source drivers have come a long way and are pretty good at this point ) and better support for the latest graphics cards. In case of the HD5600 series I see absolutely no need to install closed source drivers.\n", "Q: Can't Upgrade Ubuntu the System The upgrade needs a total of 27.4 M free space on disk '/boot'. Please free at least an additional 9,027 k of disk space on '/boot'. Empty your trash and remove temporary packages of former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.\nHow to get free space for installing new updates? \nI checked the boot in the file system. There were different versions of the same thing. Can I just delete older versions by myself to get free space? \n\nA: It is a good idea to use\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nfrom time to time. Apt-get manpage says:\nautoremove\n     autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically\n     installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no\n     longer needed.\n\nThis removes \"remainings\" of previous kernel versions and I'd bet it should free enough disk space in your case, too.\n\nA: I would simply remove some of the old boot files, and then run upgrade-grub. For example:\ncd /boot\nls vmlinuz-*\n\nSay, if you have \nvmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic\nvmlinuz-3.2.0-57-generic\n\nand want to remove all files with version 3.2.0-57, you could do:\nsudo -s\nremove *-3.2.0-57-*\nupdate-grub\n\nThe last command fixes the grub boot menu to reflect the changes you've made.\n", "Q: Audio decoder (mp3) is not present I have installed ubuntu13.10.

If I bind Fn+F9 and Fn+F10 then it doesn't work. It means, something is up with my Fn keys.\nTried to google, didn't find answer to my problem. Hope you can help me!\n\nA: Not sure if this will help too much, but I've found that if you go through the system testing program (I think that's what it's called, anyways it has a thumbnail of a monitor with a green image, just search for it under installed programs) it will sometimes fix things like that.  If you want you can just skip all the tests except for the media key tests, but I find that the other tests are still helpful.  You can also try googling for changing fn key values, I know a lot of keyboards have the option to reverse the F keys and the funtion buttons, so that for F1 you would need to press Fn + F1 for example, and the media key that would normally require Fn would do it without it.

I got the \"Unix And Linux System Administration Handbook\" It speaks of several verisons of linux and unix, and the commands for viewing linux man pages and not specific to ubuntu. \nHow do I view the manpages?\n\nA: @Jobin answer is perfect, I always like to add more options so Op can know it.\nIf you want to redirect a command man to a txt file:\nman <command> > /location/file (change location and the name of file )\n\nAnother thing I would like you to know:\nWhen for example you type man ls, you will see LS (1) at the top, numbers mean:\n (1)     User Commands\n (2)     System Calls\n (3)     Library functions\n (4)     Devices\n (5)     File formats\n (6)     Games and Amusements\n (7)     Conventions and Miscellany\n (8)     System Administration and Priveledged Commands\n (L)     Local. Some programs install their man pages into this section instead \n (N)     TCL commands\n\nAnd if you want to view man pages on terminal I would prefer to use:\nman <command> | less so you can view it as pages \nFor more options: man man\n\nA: To view a manual page related to a package, open a terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T together) and type:\nman <package_name>\n\nFor example, to view grep's manual page, type:\nman grep\n\nThis will open the manual page referring to the section numbers in the order:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n\nIf you want to open the manual page of a specific section, type:\nman <section_number> <package_name>\n\nFor example, to open the manual page of the open() function in C, you should type:\nman 2 open\n\nMore information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Refer to the the manual page for man.\n\n*Search through Ubuntu Manpages at: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/.\n\nA: If using unity you can also access thru the Dash via yelp & the manpages scope\nOpen Dash home, type in manpages:whatever, ex. manpages:bash \nAvailable man's will be displayed, when clicked on open in help window\nThe bookmark option in help when opened this way is semi useful, could be better.\n\nA: You can also view man pages in a browser.\nInstall the man2html package using sudo apt-get install man2html and then navigate to http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html\n\nA: You can use man package/command(name) and for more information about how man works try using man man\n\nA: Your knee-jerk reaction when trying to study about new command or config file should be:\nman command\nman file.conf\n\nor\nman command<Tab>\nman file<Tab>\n\nThe argument to man is actually manpage name and the package maintainer is expected to add any manpages users would need.  For many prolific packages, you can normally expect:\n\n\n*\n\n*one manpage per command -- named exactly as the command,\n\n*at least one manpage about configuration files (typically named exactly\nas the main configuration file).\nHowever the man page system is a huge, really rich resource.  There are actually far more man pages that don't deal with particular command or even particular program.  For example, the manpage system typically contains documentation of:\n\n\n*\n\n*commands (section 1) but often also pages that are not directly commands\neg. perlre,\n\n*kernel calls (section 2),\n\n*system library calls (section 3),\n\n*special system files (section 4),\n\n*configuration files and formats (section 5),\n\n*games (yes, games! .. although I've never seen anything there) (section 6),\n\n*miscellaneous stuff (like man 7 ascii, man 7 iso-8859-1,\nman 7 wireless) (section 7)\nAlso, packages may provide their documentation as manpage sections.  For example, perl-doc adds section 3perl where you can find all its modules, OpenSSL adds 3ssl.\nNot sure if it's on Ububtu, but on Fedora there is man-pages package that provides even more goods like POSIX versions of commands or system calls.\n\nA: Just my 2¢:\nIf you type man man (i.e. looking up the manpage for man) you get:\n* man (1) \nman (7mp) \nman (1p) \nMan: What manual page do you want? \nMan:\n\nThis shows you what sections are available for a given man page.  You can type in 1, 7mp, 1p to view whichever fits your fancy. 1p, for example, is the manpage for the command as defined by POSIX.  If you are feeling particularly lazy, you can just hit enter at the Man: prompt and it will go to the default (*) section.\nYou can tell man which section you want by adding the section number to your request like (looking for info on mkdir command):\nman 1 mkdir\nor\nman mkdir.1\nor\nman mkdir(1)\nAs far as the sections, I might suggest the following guide (from man 2.10.2):\nThe table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by  the  types  of\npages they contain.\n\n\n\n\nsection\ncontent\n\n\n\n\n0\nHeader files (usually found in /usr/include)\n\n\n1\nExecutable programs or shell commands\n\n\n2\nSystem calls (functions provided by the kernel)\n\n\n3\nLibrary calls (functions within program libraries)\n\n\n4\nSpecial files (usually found in /dev)\n\n\n5\nFile formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd\n\n\n6\nGames\n\n\n7\nMiscellaneous   (including   macro  packages  and  conventions),  e.g.  man(7), groff(7), man-pages(7)\n\n\n8\nSystem administration commands (usually only for root)\n\n\n9\nKernel routines [Non standard]\n\n\n\n\nIf you get bored w/ output you can change the pager to something like bat or use a colorizer.  There are several ways to do this, just search for \"how to colorize man page output\" or something like that.  It is worth looking over the manpage on man and on less (the default pager used by man) as it will make looking up stuff a lot easier in the future.  It is good to know that you can do something even if you have to look up how some other time.\n", "Q: nut (UPS) and SSL certificates Today I installed nut on my Ubuntu server (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).\n$ uname -a\nLinux boson 3.13.0-24-generic #47-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 2 23:30:00 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nThe UPS is connected to another server (called neutron), so I use nut-client to keep tabs on the UPS state.\nWhen I do sudo upsc ups@neutron.local I get:\nInit SSL without certificate database\nbattery.charge: 15\nbattery.charge.low: 10\nbattery.charge.warning: 50\nbattery.date: not set\nbattery.mfr.date: 2012/11/27\n:\n\nThe first line of the output concerns me. I've not seen this on other installations of nut on Debian-based servers.\nWhat can I do to get rid of that line?\nEDIT: This \"Init SSL without certificate database\" is extra annoying because it is not part of the output of upsc and therefore I cannot grep it out. \nEDIT(2): To clarify, the (Synology) server (which talks directly to the UPS) is not set-up with SSL or certificates. Other (Debian/Raspbian) clients on the network do not have the above issue. No SSL certificates are installed (as far as I can find out).\nfind / |grep cert_db on either the server or the clients yields no results.\n\nA: Your problem is due to the new NSS backend in nut, which was added in 2.7.1 (Changes from 2.6.5 to 2.7.1).  The client tries first to contact tcp/3943 with a STARTTLS command and gets ERR FEATURE-NOT-CONFIGURED from upsd, so it shows that warning.\nThe rationale for this change is that you are transmitting passwords in plaintext over the wire and the developers added SSL certificate support to prevent that.  The client is being noisy, after all.\nThe error message is actually from the client, but you cannot exclude it with a grep because it's coming from the error output (stderr).\nThe easiest way of solving your problem is to pipe it properly:\nupsc ups@neutron.local 2>&1 | grep -v '^Init SSL'\n\nor if you're just using some part of the output for e.g. an RRD graph and you were getting garbage in your cron output, just add the 2>&1 and it will be a normal line:\nupsc ups@neutron.local 2>&1 | grep 'battery.charge:' | awk ...\n\nThe not-so-easy way of fixing this is to actually configure SSL certificates and the rest of the stuff, like described in 10. Notes on securing NUT | Configuring SSL.\n\nA: (For others like me coming via Google)\nJust do proper output redirection to filter out the warning message:\nupsc ups@neutron.local > /dev/stdout 2> /dev/null\n\n\nA: You must underline where to find the certificate database, and also tell the certificate  that clients will use and the password to decrypt the private key associated with your (public) key by editing upsd.conf:\n\n\n*\n\n*CERTPATH /usr/local/ups/etc/cert_db\n\n*CERTIDENT 'certificate name' 'database password'\n\n", "Q: Can't install AMD graphics drivers I just switched from my old BackTrack 5 installation to a Kubuntu installation.

I have three aclocal files in usr/share/ like alocal, aclocal-1.13 and aclocal-1.4\nHow can I fix that alocal error?\nEDIT:\nSome time ago I compiled latest version of automake from source and installed it because a source code needed recent version of automake to run configure process. \nSince then whenever I run standard ./autogen and /configure commands in source directory to generate makefile I get \n  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG: command not found\n\nerror\n  find /usr -name \"pkg.m4\"\n\ngives me \n  /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4\n\nand\n  aclocal --print-ac-dir\n\ngives me\n  /usr/local/share/aclocal\n\n\nA: The PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG variable refers to a macro pkg.m4 that is provided as part of the pkg-config package, so the first thing to check is that pkg-config is installed and that the macro file is in the default location (and is readable, of course)\ndpkg -l pkg-config\n\nls -l /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4\n\nIf that checks out, then the question becomes why is aclocal not finding it? You can check where aclocal is configured to look for third-party m4 files using the --print-ac-dir switch i.e.\naclocal --print-ac-dir\n\nIf that's not the same as the location above, it suggests there is a non-standard version of automake on your system - if you can't resolve that, then a possible workaround is to set or export the ACLOCAL_PATH environment variable before running the autogen.sh script e.g. \nACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/share/aclocal ./autogen.sh\n\nor \nexport ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/share/aclocal\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\n\nSee the macro search path section of the GNU automake manual.\n", "Q: I can't change my brightness setting on my computer Whenever I try to change my brightness setting, it doesn't change.

However, remapping the print-screen behaviour to the appropriate shortcut keys on every computer is rather tedious. I would like be able to run a script to do this for me and others. \nI found this similar Askubuntu question, which appears to want to do the same sort of thing (set shortcuts through the CLI), but unfortunately, it doesn't work for me (yet). I am pretty sure a few things in my script just need tweaking, or perhaps things have drastically changed between 12.10 and 14.04?\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings shutter --select \"['<Shift>Print']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings shutter --full \"['Print']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings shutter --active \"['<Alt>Print']\"\n\nExample Error output:\n\n\nA: It turns out that custom shortcuts are slightly different and you need to run 3 commands for each. I managed to get it \"working\" with the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Add the paths for if we are adding rather than overwritting shortcuts\nKEY_PATH=\"/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings \\\n\"['$KEY_PATH/custom0/', '$KEY_PATH/custom1/', '$KEY_PATH/custom2/']\"\n\n# Now set the shortcuts\nBEGINNING=\"gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings\"\n\n$BEGINNING/custom0/ name \"Take Full Screenshot\"\n$BEGINNING/custom0/ command \"shutter --full\"\n$BEGINNING/custom0/ binding \"Print\"\n\n$BEGINNING/custom1/ name \"Grab Active Window\"\n$BEGINNING/custom1/ command \"shutter --active\"\n$BEGINNING/custom1/ binding \"<Alt>Print\"\n\n$BEGINNING/custom2/ name \"Screenshot Selection\"\n$BEGINNING/custom2/ command \"shutter --select\"\n$BEGINNING/custom2/ binding \"<Shift>Print\"\n\nNote that this will overwrite your first 3 custom shortcuts (if they exist) and you may want to rename custom0, custom1, custom2 accordingly in order to not do this. \nOne also needs to manually disable the printscreen shortcuts as shown below (although would be grateful if someone could just update this answers script with the appropriate command(s).\n\n\nA: Alternatively you can use Compiz to set keyboard commands:\n\ngconftool -t string /apps/compiz/plugins/commands/allscreens/options/command0 -s \"shutter --full\"\ngconftool -t string /apps/compiz/plugins/commands/allscreens/options/run_command0_key -s \"< Control>k\"\n\nNote: Compiz must be using dconf as the backend.\n", "Q: Mac server.app equivalent for Ubuntu server? In Mac OS X there is the server.app which makes all server related things simple and easy.\nIs there something like this for Ubuntu server, or at least something that easily sets up a domain name?\n\nA: Not really, the server version of Ubuntu is just like the regular Ubuntu, less the graphical interface. There exists many third party application (mostly web applications) such as cPanel that provide you with some of the things that server.app allows on Mac servers.\n\nA: Zentyal which can be downloaded from apt-get or just download the zentyal iso, has an excellent management software.  Though its more of a small business server platform.  Webmin works, but ubuntu doesn't recommend it.\nHonestly, you should just rock out the command line, in the beginning its hard, but as you get used to it, its faster than any GUI.\nGood Luck\n", "Q: How do I delay a startup application in Lubuntu? I want Firefox to start automatically when I start Lubuntu. I have the LXSession Configuration app installed. In it, I've tried entering all the suggestions in this question, such as:\nbash -c \"sleep 10 && firefox\"\n\nsleep 10 && firefox\n\nxterm -e 'sleep 10 && firefox'\n\nsh -c \"sleep 10 && skype &\"\n\nFor all of them, they work on the command line, but not when I enter them in the LXSession Configuration interface.\nIf I enter firefox by itself, it launches when Lubuntu starts.\nI'm guessing all the sleep commands above only work in Ubuntu. How to I get a program to delay when autostarting in Lubuntu?\nExtra note: The reason I want to delay Firefox is because I autoconnect to a VPN, and it takes a while for the VPN to complete connecting. I need Firefox to start after the VPN connection is complete, so if there is any way to force one program (like Firefox) to start upon completion of some other event (network manager completing a connection), that would work too.\n\nA: Try this:\nCreate a file $HOME/.config/upstart/firefox-with-delay.conf\nContent:\nstart on desktop-start\nstop on desktop-end\n\nscript\n    sleep 30\n    firefox \nend script\n\nMore info: \nhttp://ifdeflinux.blogspot.de/2013/04/upstart-user-sessions-in-ubuntu-raring.html\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/\n", "Q: USB mobile broadband dongles in Ubuntu (14.04)? Where to start? Your situation or what you need to get a working Internet connection with a mobile broadband USB dongle:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the USB dongle, of course.\n\n*You have a 3G, 4G or whatever SIM card with a data plan and also the SIMs PIN an PUK. Preferably the SIM card is not blocked, so you just need to enter the PIN when asked for.\n\n\n\nMy best and honest advice\nTry to avoid the whole usb-modeswitch trouble by buying a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot. It saves you valuable time. \n\nHello frequent AU users. The reason why I am asking this question:\n\nThere are a lot of questions about mobile broadband USB dongles here at AskUbuntu, you can find them by browsing the referenced tags below. Unfortunately users still seem to be lost – not knowing what to ask and where to start – also valuable answers are seemingly hard to discover. So let me start with this simple question and try to iron out this issue.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu generally supports mobile broadband USB dongles. So let's start with:\nHow it should work\n\n\n*\n\n*The dongle gets detected\nYou get the following window that asks for the SIMs PIN. Enter your PIN, check Automatically unlock this device and click Unlock.\n\nIf you've made it this far, you know that your dongle is supported.\n\n*Create a new Mobile Broadband connection\nSelect New Mobile Brodband connection... from the network indicator.\n\nThis will bring up the mobile broadband setup wizard.\n\n Alternatively you can click Edit Connections..., then click the Add button in the Network Connections menu and select Mobile Broadband as the Connection Type, which will then also bring up the wizard shown below.\n\n\nFollow the instructions and choose settings according to your country and provider/carrier. Mine looks like this:\n\n\n*Done\nThat's basically it, you should have a working Internet connection in a few seconds when you hit the Continue button.\nTroubleshooting - The easy part\n\n\n*\n\n*The SIM card is blocked\nPut the SIM in another device like a phone and enter the PUK when asked for. If that somehow does not work, you will need to call your providers/carriers customer support hotline.\n\n*Installing the Windows driver on Windows\nRumor has it that this works for some devices and has to be performed only once when the device is completely new and hasn't been used before. This is only needed to change the mode of the dongle. (See explanation about usb-modeswitch below.)\nTroubleshooting - The difficult part\nRemember, you don't have to go through very time consuming and probably frustrating troubleshooting. If your WiFi already works, buy a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot.\nThe dongle doesn't get detected\nIf you don't get the window shown in step 1, then it might be that the SIM card is blocked (see paragraph above), not properly inserted (e.g. upside down) or the dongle itself is not detected due to usb-modeswitch issues.\nThe thing with USB modes on these devices is, to first present the dongle as a read only storage device with an (outdated) driver that you could install and then change the mode so that the device can be used as it was intended. However you almost never need to install these drivers. The situation in most cases is, that Linux already has a driver, but somehow cannot activate the mobile broadband modem part of the dongle.\nThe following links might be helpful for further troubleshooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MobileWirelessBroadband\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager/Hardware/3G\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_3G_Modem\nDetermining which device you are using\nYou should also find out which dongle you have (as you can see in the example it's not always quite obvious and the lsusb output may also not be accurate), search for it online and provide maker and model name along with to Ubuntu version you are using when you ask a new question, thus helping everyone finding questions already asked and corresponding answers.\nThere are only a few manufacturers of these dongles, namely Huawei and ZTE, but a lot of carriers re-brand them. Here is how it looks on mine:\n\nIt's a Huawei K5320. (A very old device. This is not meant to be a recommendation.)\n", "Q: How to combine two different installation of Ubuntu? I have upgraded to 14.04, installing it side by side with my Ubuntu 12.04. I have Windows8 as well. So now I have three - OS to boot from my laptop.\n(500 GB for Win8, 250 GB for 12.04 and ~ 200 GB for 14.04)\nI do not know why I chose that in the first go, but now I want to revert back and combine the two Ubuntu's into one, using only 14.04. I had the option of doing a fresh install (I couldn't go for upgrade, idk why. I was using USB to install) but installing it side by side seemed a better idea then.\nHowever, now I realize the horror I've done. My files are a big mess and will get messier. I have no clue what is where and its an unorganized chaos.\nIs there a way to combine 14.04 and 12.04? Do I have to delete both of them and do a fresh install? How to do that?\n\nA: One possible solution is to boot 14.04, copy the files in your 12.04 home folder over to the 14.04 home folder. Organise them as you wish.\nMake a backup on an external disk just in case.\nThen boot a live USB using the \"Try Ubuntu\" option.\nNext use Gparted to delete the 12.04 partition and enlarge the 14.04 partition. DO NOT REBOOT.\nReinstall grub using boot-repair.\nYou will have to reinstall any programs you had in 12.04 that you need.\n", "Q: Linksys WMP110 works on fresh installation, but won't work after reboot I've been at this for 2 weeks now, with no consistent success. The above NIC will work on a brand new install of most distros, but after a reboot or 2 will not connect. WICD gives the bad password error, ndiswrapper doesn't work, and manually managing wpa_supplicant via wpa_gui also doesn't connect. The network is always seen, just can't connect. The router is set to AES or TKIP. This same computer/NIC will connect under Windows. All other devices connect. Other distros on other computers connect.

I am not able to find trash anywhere. Can you please tell me a command or anything like that to empty the trash using terminal ?\n\nA: You are looking for the $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash directory. The trash directory is defined in the \"Desktop Trash Can Specification\" of the freedesktop site. This variable is normally not available in the terminal windows, hence you will need for trash-empty. This command follows all the specification of the Freedesktop.org and it's intelligent enough to find out where the Trash is. You will need to install it first.\nThere are other tools for this, like gvfs-trash --empty which can also send items to the Trash can.\n\nA: You can use the rm command:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*\n\nThe rm command removes (deletes) files or directories.\n-f, --force     Ignore nonexistant files, and never prompt before removing.\n-r, -R, --recursive     Remove directories and their contents recursively.\n\nThe trash folder is found at: $HOME/.local/share/Trash\nBe careful how you use the rm command - the files aren't sent to a trash can where you can undelete them, so it's not easy to undo.\n\nA: After you sudo apt install trash-cli, you can do\ntrash-empty\n\nMore interesting details about trash handling below and in the man page.\nrestore-trash (1)    - Restore for Command line trash utility.\ntrash (1)            - Command line trash utility.\ntrash-empty (1)      - Empty for Command line trash utility.\ntrash-list (1)       - List trashed files.\ntrash-put (1)        - Command line trash utility.\ntrash-rm (1)         - Removes files matching a pattern from the trash can\n\n\nA: With trash-cli installed type trash-empty I've used this successfully to empty the trash across different drives and numerous locations.\nto install trash-cli type\n sudo apt-get install trash-cli\nOr you could use this script to do it for you.\n", "Q: How to use espeak command in ubuntu?

I was looking in the BIOS and I made a change from boot mode UEFI to the other mode \"OCM \" or \" OSM \". Now when I turn on my computer, I get this error message:\n\nreboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected\n  boot device and press a key\n\nI turned it back to UEFI mode but without any change. I even tried to boot it on cd/usb of windows but without any change. What should I do?\n\nA: I suspect the option you selected was the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is a fancy way of saying you enabled BIOS (aka legacy) support. Note that most modern computers don't have BIOSes, no matter what the manufacturers say; they have EFIs, which are completely different. Referring to them as BIOSes just causes confusion, IMHO. They can boot BIOS-mode OSes through the CSM, which is to EFI much like what dosemu or WINE is to Linux.\nIf your firmware interpreted the activation of CSM as an \"only-use-CSM\" sort of thing, that would explain why you'd be unable to boot once you activated the CSM -- you probably had no BIOS-mode boot loader installed, so it would be like telling Linux to launch WINE and no other native Linux programs when you have no Windows programs installed -- useless.\nOnce you de-activated the CSM, the computer should have begun booting again; but it's conceivable yours has a bug that causes it to forget its EFI boot entries after you've activated the CSM; or maybe the CSM remained active, with its boot entry at the top of the EFI's list. I can suggest four possible solutions at this point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter your firmware setup utility and look for a boot-order option. If you see an entry called \"Ubuntu,\" move it to the top of the boot list.\n\n*Enter your firmware's built-in boot manager (typically by pressing some function key other than the one you use to enter the setup utility). If there's an \"Ubuntu\" entry, use it. If Ubuntu boots, you can then use efibootmgr to reset Ubuntu to the top of the boot list. You would first type sudo efibootmgr to get a list of boot options. Note the number associated with the Ubuntu entry -- for instance, it might be Boot0005. You'd then type sudo efibootmgr -o 5 to make \"Ubuntu\" (actually GRUB) the default boot loader. (You can specify a set of boot loaders to be tried in order, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 5,1,2 to use 5, then 1 if that fails, then 2 if both 5 and 1 fail.)\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and create a suitable boot medium from it. You can then boot to it (using a function key to access your computer's built-in boot manager). If you can boot Linux in this way, you can then either use efibootmgr (as above) to reset GRUB as the default or install the Debian-package version of rEFInd (directly or via a PPA; see the rEFInd page for details) to make rEFInd your default boot manager.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool. This is an easy solution on the surface, but this tool often does more than it needs to do, which can occasionally cause follow-on problems.\n\n", "Q: No Swap Partition! I'm in dire need of help.\nMy system has become incredibly laggy and hardly usable. I have realised that this is because for some reason I'm running without virtual memory (this is not intentional). It is a recent phenomenon and the system was much more responsive until a couple of days ago, so I can only summarise it is a recent phenomenon. I cannot  think of anything I did to cause this (except attempt to use the Hibernation feature, which failed - did it maybe fill up my swap partition with garbage and leave it there? I do not know. How could I find out?)\nAs a novice my difficulty is compounded by the fact that I am running on a fully encrypted SSD using LUKS.

I saw in fstab that I seem to have two entries that look swap-like (swap_1 and cryptswap) and I do not know which of the two would be the hypothetical target, not to mention all the deep jargon.)\n\nA: I was having the same issue, Eliah Kagan's answer on this other thread did the trick for me.\nHere's the most important bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) or a virtual console and run: sudo swapoff -a\n\n*Open /etc/crypttab (e.g., sudo nano -w /etc/crypttab or sudo -H gedit /etc/cryptab for a GUI editor) and put a # at the beginning of the line that starts with cryptswap1. Save the file.\n\n*Do the same thing with the line that starts with /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 in /etc/fstab.\n\n*Install gparted . Run it and format your swap partition as linux-swap. Make sure to get the right partition; if you get the wrong one, you'll lose possibly important data! The line you commented out in crypttab should give the correct partition name (it comes right after /dev/).\n\n*Run sudo mkswap /dev/..., repacing ... with that same device name. Part of that command's output should be text that says UUID=..... where ..... is a string of letters and numbers.\n\n*In the file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume, find the line that says RESUME=UUID= followed by letters and numbers like (but not identical to) ..... from the last step. Replace them with ..... (i.e., with the letters and numbers mkswap gave after UUID=.\n\n*Run sudo swapon /dev/... (with the same /dev/... as you had in steps 4 and 5 above).\n\n*Run sudo ecryptfs-setup-swap.\n\n\nswapon -s will check to see if swap is successfully enabled. See that blog post for more information, and example output, for checking this.\nNo more laggy behavior ð‿ð\n\nhey look, imgur gave the image a palindromic name\n\nA: I’m not sure whether this qualifies as a ‘solution’ (insofar as I am not quite sure what I have solved beyond successfully re-enabling virtual memory) but by commenting out the ‘cryptoswap’ line in /etc/fstab so it reads\n# /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nallows swapon to succeed in activating swap on /dev/mapper/ubuntu—-vg-swap_1\nThe lag I had noticed seems to be related to TPM (power management), but I don’t know how to solve that yet. I’ve just discovered that by connecting to an external power supply the issue disappears until the next reboot.\n\nA: Your basic problem has nothing to do with swap. Lack of swap leads to OOM crashes, not lags. I think your problem is that you have LUKS encrypted disk, and put ecryptfs encrypted home folder over it (unless, of cause, you manually called your mount point ~/.Private for some reason ) This leads to vast overusage of CPU, which only increases the more files you put in you home directory.\nI suggest you remove home folder encryption or at least move all your non-hidden files out of it somewhere else. \n", "Q: No swap in Xubuntu 14.04 LTE with full disk/system encryption I'm a newbee to Linux. I installed Xubuntu 14.04 LTE on my 1.6GHz/2GB RAM/120 GB SSD HDD netbook. Everything goes smoothly, except I realized that during booting and logging in there was a warning that swap file was unavailable. I used the hints from this forum and from others to remove this, but the system still lacks swap. \nPlease note that I had no such issues with a similar notebook installation, during which I did not use encrypted partition etc.\nSo, in the netbook with issues, GParted reports the following partitions:\n/dev/sda1 [keys icon] ext2  /boot  243MiB\n/dev/sda2  extended     111.55 GiB\n   /dev/sda5 [exclamation mark icon]  crypt-liks   111.55 GiB\nSo, no swap is available.

Except, of cause, you are doign very RAM intensive things.\n\n*Also there is the option to create a swap file instead of a partition.\nDetails: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\n", "Q: Screen turns black when using launcher icons I may have found a new bug, I can't find anything resembling the problem I'm having.\nI recently upgraded to 14.04 from 13.10, and the launcher is virtually useless.

I can also run java -version and get the correct response from Java.  so far so good.\nso now I try to startup Tomcat (tried also catalina.sh), and I get the following:\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo /opt/tomcat7/apache-tomcat-7.0.53/bin/startup.sh\nNeither the JAVA_HOME nor the JRE_HOME environment variable is defined\nAt least one of these environment variable is needed to run this program\n\nbut...  I just tried echo $JAVA_HOME and it worked?\n\nA: Since you have set the environment variable for your own user and not for the superuser, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have to export the variable using -E option as follows:\nsudo -E /opt/tomcat7/apache-tomcat-7.0.53/bin/startup.sh\n\nNote that this will export all environment variables while running the command. This is not preferred since the normal users environment is spilled out when you run the command as root. This is not desirable.\n\n*Export the variable in root's .bashrc /etc/enviroment file. Open a terminal and type:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\n\nand enter your administrative password, and add the following lines to the end of the file:\nJAVA_HOME=/opt/java/jdk1.8.0_05\nPATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin\n\nand then\nsource /etc/environment\n\nor restart your machine and then retry the command you were using.\n\nUpdate:\nThis answer provided hints as two why step 2 wouldn't work, sudo would reset the environment and provide a secure path, so all global variables are reset. A workaround would be to use\nsudo su\n\nand then execute command which uses the set environment variables.\n\nA: There is a help text in catalina.sh. I will quote it here:\n#   Do not set the variables in this script. Instead put them into a script\n#   setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate.\n\n#\n#   JAVA_HOME       Must point at your Java Development Kit installation.\n#                   Required to run the with the \"debug\" argument.\n\n# Ensure that any user defined CLASSPATH variables are not used on startup,\n# but allow them to be specified in setenv.sh, in rare case when it is needed.\nCLASSPATH=\n\nif [ -r \"$CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh\" ]; then\n  . \"$CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh\"\nelif [ -r \"$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh\" ]; then\n  . \"$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh\"\nfi\n\nWhen you starting tomcat using catalina.sh, it searching for file setenv.sh and sourcing it. It is searching in CATALINA_HOME or CATALINA_BASE.\nSo the better way to set JAVA_HOME for the tomcat is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script named setenv.sh in the folder CATALINA_BASE/bin, if it does not exist already.\n\n*Add this line to setenv.sh\nexport JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/jdk1.8.0_05\n\n\n*Make it executable.\n\nWhy you should use this solution:\nSetting environment variable in script is safer. Always try to set variables as locally as possible. Try do not use /etc/environment, /etc/profile and others if you really do not need Global Environment Variable. Setting JAVA_HOME in setenv.sh gives you ability to use different tomcats with different applications that need different version of java, but running by one user. Other user environment would not be affected by you.\n\nA: The solution I was looking for is in /etc/environment which, as specified at EnvironmentVariables, does not process scripts and does not expand variables, so adding the following (without export) did the trick:\nJAVA_HOME=/opt/java/jdk1.8.0_05\n\nThen I rebooted the system for the changes to take affect.\n\nA: I added JAVA_HOME in tomcat7.service script as setenv.sh was not get sourced by catalina.sh\nSteps:\n1.Open tomcat7 service script file\nsudo gedit /etc/init.d/tomcat7\n2.Set JAVA_HOME\n.\n.\n.\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle\n\n# Directory where the Tomcat 6 binary distribution resides\nCATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/$NAME\n\n# Directory for per-instance configuration files and webapps\nCATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/$NAME\n\n# Use the Java security manager? (yes/no)\nTOMCAT7_SECURITY=no\n\n3.Start tomcat7 service\nsudo service tomcat7 status\n\nA: Choose or try a different JDK.\nSet $JAVA_HOME as described in the catalina.sh intro or other Tomcat documentation, and do not alter anything else apart from the environment variables defined therein (e.g. Catalina Home/Base). Then run the following;\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nsudo update-alternatives --config javac\nsudo update-alternatives --config javadoc\nsudo update-alternatives --config javap\n\nOn each one, I had to switch down from version 11 to version 8 of the Java Development Kit/JDK, for tomcat version 8. I tested twice, and I am sure this was the solution (with update alternatives, Java dependent programs know where to find Java so you don't have to repeat in the env vars file). A Initially, I did find that my shutdown.sh script was looking for my server at port 8005 while it was started at 8080 (Severe could not contact localhost:8005. Tomcat may not be running. Or connection refused error). But the server itself did shutdown. I manually started it back up again, and shut it back down only to find that the error was not a reoccurring one. \nJoin the tomcat users group, I think you will see that Tomcat alone can be a headache. Then be patient with yourself! \nNB/CAVEAT: test one change at a time, and update others accordingly.\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu for tablets?

I was surprised to not find more people asking this question, but so far I've only found one from a couple of years ago, with not much in the way of responses. \nFirst, some background on what I'm actually trying to accomplish here: I am working on a custom spin of Edubuntu designed for use by educational nonprofits in low/no-bandwidth locations. The server would need to come pre-configured in some specific ways, and I need a reliable way to provide updates to those configurations without having direct access to the systems. Thus, a .deb repository that can be put on a USB drive if necessary seems like a reasonable solution.\nIt looks like the packagename.install file wants you to specify every file and dir that you want to include in your package individually. For a package that just places or updates files on a system, this seems like overkill (and quite tedious if you have a lot of files/dirs), as opposed to having something like this your build dir:\nfs/\n |-etc/\n    |-apache2/\n         |- conf.d/\n               |- some_custom_settings.conf\n |-var/\n    |-www/\n         |-html/\n            |- some_custom_page.html\n\nAND SO ON\n\nand then having the \"build\" process basically just be rsync -a fs/ /\n...but then, that also seems a bit hacky, which makes me wonder if I'm either missing something or just using the wrong tool for the job.\nOf course, I could just suck it up and use the more tedious packagename.install approach to make .debs, or maybe I should look into something like Puppet instead, assuming there's a way to push updates to disconnected systems in that scenario. Or maybe just a git repo? \nBasically, I'd welcome any suggestions, whether via .debs or something else.\nThanks in advance to anyone who can answer!\n\nA: Effing Package Management https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm is one of my favorite tools for creating packages.\nCreate the directory tree you want and use https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/Source:-dir \n", "Q: GRUB doesnt detect my Windows Partiton I recently mounted the tmpfs in /dev/sda1 where the windows partition was supposed to be at so since then i got a invalid signature when i clicked the windows in grub menu. later I used boot-repair hoping it would solve it what it did was remove the windows from my grub choices. i've also tried reinstalling grub. i know i've got to change something with /etc/fstab but im too scared.\nwhen i click os-prober i get no result, tried update-grub still nothing.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7484895/ : is my Boot  info script!\nPartition list are here\nthere's my partitions.\nplease help..

Aside from waiting for some good soul at Ubuntu to tell me what is going on, which I do not expect to happen, what can I do to see exactly what the system is complaining about, so that I might possibly have a shot at correcting it myself.

For example;\nRO:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic root=UUID=AAC884AC1F144321 loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk **ro**   quiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nRW:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic root=UUID=AAC884AC1F144321 loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk **rw**   quiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nHow can I permanently edit this, so that I no longer after edit this EVERY time I boot-up. I greatly appreciate any help. I am a total noob with this OS!\n\nA: To answer your question literally: edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux and change ro to rw, then run sudo update-grub. This regenerates the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg which is used at boot time.\nBut don't do this! ro is the right setting. Changing ro to rw cannot help. Your problem was not solved by changing the boot option, it was solved by running fsck. Now that this is done, the filesystem is usable again.\nFilesystem corruption isn't supposed to happen. You should look for the cause of the corruption. This could be a memory problem; run a memory test (select “memory test” at the Grub prompt and leave it running for at least one full pass, e.g. overnight).\n\nA: You do not want to edit your GRUB to permanently change ro to rw.  You will render some of your recovery options inoperable.  If you ever need one of them you might run into problems.  A better approach is to edit the /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local file and modify a line in that file.  If you have changed your 10_lupin or 10_linux files, you will need to revert your changes before doing what follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open in your favorite editor as root superuser your /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local file. Look for the line that reads as follows:\nmount ${roflag} -o loop -t ${FSTYPE} ${LOOPFLAGS} \"/host/${LOOP#/}\" ${rootmnt}\n\n\n*Comment out that line and add the following three lines below that line (make sure they line up with the above line you have commented out):\nloopdev=`losetup -f`\nlosetup ${loopdev} \"/host/${LOOP#/}\"\nmount ${roflag} -t ${FSTYPE} ${LOOPFLAGS} ${loopdev} ${rootmnt}\n\n\n*Save the file and run in a terminal:\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter that, you can reboot your system and you should be good to go whenever kernel updates come around, and you will be able to use recovery options as they should be used. Make sure to make a backup of the edited file in case an upgrade removes your changes. That way, if an upgrade manages to break your changes, you can copy the modified lines in the backed up file and place them in the proper location.\n\nA: What I have done is:\n\n\n*\n\n*mounted root.disk to /dev/1\n\n*modified ro to rw in /dev/1/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n*reboot\n\n*successfully loaded Ubuntu\n\n\nDetails:\nsudo mkdir /dev/1\nsudo mount -t ext4 -o loop /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /dev/1\nsudo vi /dev/1/boot/grub/grb.cfg\n\nreplace the ro to rw in lines which looks like\nlinux /vmlinuz-2.6.28-13-generic root=UUID=9018bfe2-9de3-4692-9883-fc2f875e6455 ro  quiet splash\n\nto\nlinux /vmlinuz-2.6.28-13-generic root=UUID=9018bfe2-9de3-4692-9883-fc2f875e6455 ro  quiet splash\n\n\n\n*\n\n*save using wq!\n\n*reboot\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - menu bar , side bar missing I am running a Ubuntu 14.04 machine.

After entering my credentials lightdm goes black for a second and then brings me back to the login screen.\nI think the problem might be related to my encrypted home directory. After a reboot, if I login via a virtal console (ctrl-alt-F1) my home directory gets properly decrypted and mounted. If I stay logged in via the virtual console I can kill the X server and still login again in lightdm, presumably because my home directory didn't get unmounted (as I still had an active session open). But if I logout of the virtual console, killing the X server results in me not being able to login via lightdm and if I login using the virtual console my home directory doesn't get automatically unencrypted/mounted.

Also how to append (vs replace) using rename command?\n\nA: In bash, you could use extended shell globs e.g.\nfor file in path/to/files/!(*.*); do echo mv \"$file\" \"$file.html\"; done\n\n(remove the echo once you've confirmed it is matching the correct pattern). If extended globbing is not already enabled, you can enable it with shopt -s extglob.\nAnother option is using the perl-based rename function with a regex that excludes literal .\nrename -nv 's/^[^.]+$/$&.html/' path/to/files/*\n\n(remove the n option once you have confirmed it is matching the correct pattern).\n\nA: My prefered in cases like this is mmv.

(Ubuntu 12.04)\n\nA: The cause\nThe reason why you get this error message is that the package bt-dw1705-firmware provides a firmware file that the linux-firmware package wants to overwrite or update.\nThe package management mechanisms of Linux operating systems are designed to prevent different packages from overwriting each others files and leave the system in an inconsistent state. That is why you get this error.\nSolution\nThe bt-dw1705-firmware doesn't seem to be a Ubuntu package and therefore is probably not supported or maintained anymore, while linux-firmware clearly is.\nYou should remove bt-dw1705-firmware either with sudo apt-get remove bt-dw1705-firmware or if that doesn't work with sudo dpkg --remove bt-dw1705-firmware and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-firmware afterwards.\nAlternatively you could use sudo dpkg --force-overwrite linux-firmware according to this answer. But this will probably cause the issue to re-appear as soon as linux-firmware is updated again.\nThe answer was approved by the OP, so it's safe to assume that the firmware file in linux-firmware works, no matter which solution you pick.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS freezing frequently I'm brand new to Linux and am having a very hard time troubleshooting this problem.

Slowly migrating over as more games become available on linux. I have GTA: San Andreas on both Steam and DVD. The play on linux Steam install is bugged. I finally popped in  the DVD and used just the plain Wine 1.6.2 instead of POL to install it and now it runs beautifully, much smoother than on windows.\nNow San Andreas is no fun with out my own music, so I started to copy music to the wine directory where San Andreas is installed. However no matter what I do I can get my music to come up in game. I've tried using windows shortcuts to the mp3s (both native windows and wine windows shorcuts), I've tried linux shortcuts, I even dropped the mp3s straight into the User Tracks folder.\nAnother thing is that it will not save. It will act like it is saving, no errors, but the save game list is always empty, and no save files are created.

Now it will save the game properly but I still cannot get my music in-game.

I came up with another solution, that might not be as efficient, but this solution does not assume anything about the names of the hidden files, and therefore avoids listing .. in the result (as does the currently accepted answer).\nThe full command is:\nls -d $(echo -e \"$(\\ls)\\n$(\\ls -A)\" | sort | uniq -u)\n\nExplanation\nWhat this does is list all the files (and directories) twice,\necho -e \"$(\\ls)\\n$(\\ls -A)\"\n\nbut only showing hidden files once -A.\nThen the list is sorted | sort which makes regular (unhidden) files appear twice and next to each other.\nThen, remove all lines that appear more than once | uniq -u, only leaving unique lines.\nFinally use ls again to list all the files with the user's custom options and without listing the contents of the directories in the list -d.\nEDIT (Limitations):\nAs muru pointed out, this solution will not work correctly if there are files with names such as escaped\\ncharacter.txt because echo -e will split the filename into two lines. It will also not work as expected if there are two hidden files with almost the same name except for a special character, such as .foo[tab].txt and .foo[new-line].txt as both of those are printed as .foo?.txt and would be eliminated by uniq -u\n\nA: With bash, setting the GLOBIGNORE special variable is some non-empty value is enough to make it ignore . and .. when expanding globs. From the Bash docs:\n\nThe GLOBIGNORE shell variable may be used to restrict the set of\n  filenames matching a pattern. If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching\n  filename that also matches one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is\n  removed from the list of matches. If the nocaseglob option is set,\n  the matching against the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is performed without\n  regard to case. The filenames . and .. are always ignored when\n  GLOBIGNORE is set and not null. However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a\n  non-null value has the effect of enabling the dotglob shell option, so\n  all other filenames beginning with a ‘.’ will match.\n\nIf we set it to .:.., both . and .. will be ignored. Since setting it to anything non-null will also get this behaviour, we might as well set it to just .\nSo:\nGLOBIGNORE=.\nls -d .*\n\n\nA: Alternatively, you can also use echo .*\ne.g.\nuser@linux:~$ echo .*\n. .. .bash_aliases .bash_history .bash_logout .bashrc\nuser@linux:~$\n\nIf you prefer it in long list format, just convert the white space to a new line.\nuser@linux:~$ echo .* | tr ' ' '\\n'\n.\n..\n.bash_aliases\n.bash_history\n.bash_logout\n.bashrc\nuser@linux:~$ \n\n\nA: To list all hidden files and folders:\nls -ld .*\n\nTo list hidden files only:\nls -ld .*|grep -v ^d\n\nTo list hidden folders only:\nls -ld .*|grep ^d\n\n\nA: You can also use process substitution\n diff <(ls -1A) <(ls -1)\n\nExplanation:\nPiping the stdout of a command into the stdin of another is a powerful technique. But, what if you need to pipe the stdout of multiple commands? This is where process substitution comes in.\nProcess substitution feeds the output of a process (or processes) into the stdin of another process\nCited from here\nSo you are piping two outputs into the diff command.\nThe first command is \"ls -1A\". The \"-A\" flag works like the \"-a\" flag, but it does not show you \".\" and \"..\". So it basically shows you all the files and directories (both hidden and not-hidden) in a directory. The \"-1\" flag displays the output of \"ls\" one below the other vertically and not in a horizontal list.\n\nA: I don't like -d because it only shows no matches found if there are no matches.\nIt also does not show total [size]  at top of lines.\nI think ls -lA --ignore \"[^\\.]*\" is a better solution.\n\nA: ls -A | grep \"^\\.\"\n\n*\n\n*ls -A   lists all files (hidden and non-hidden)\n\n*grep \"^\\.\" filter apart the ones starting with a dot\n\n\nA: Thanks for all the tips on here!\nHere's a function for your .bash_aliases file that handles no command arguments, doesn't throw errors on directories without hidden files, appends / on listed directories, and outputs to a single column.\n\nlsa () {\n\n    # Exit codes with/without argument are 0 if no hidden files present\n    EXIT=$(ls -1d .!(|.) |& grep -q \"No such file\"; echo $?)\n    EXIT_ARG=$(cd $1; ls -1d .!(|.) |& grep -q \"No such file\"; echo $?)\n\n    # If no argument\n    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n        if [ $EXIT -eq 0 ]; then\n            printf \"\"\n        else\n            ls -1dp .!(|.)\n        fi\n    \n    # If argument\n    else\n        if [ $EXIT_ARG -eq 0 ]; then\n            printf \"\"\n        else\n            (cd $1; ls -1dp .!(|.))\n        fi\n    fi\n}\n\n\n\nA: A long list of answers, let's add one more, which doesn't seem to be included:\n$ ls -lA | grep ' \\.'\nThe -A option to ls includes all hidden files, except . and ...\ngrep, as used above finds  .

Does Ubuntu have a clipboard that works differently from Windows? I've noticed an anomaly between the two, perhaps a bug, or perhaps I'm misusing the functionality. It works the same way every time and leads to loss of data on my part, so even if it's me abusing the functionality someone ought to take a look at this.\nI frequently open up a Writer program for it's spell checking capabilities, etc. (the Ubuntu I'm using came with LibreOffice), and now I've lost text several times because of this weirdness. I'm trying to train my brain not to automatically close the document after selecting Cut.\nWhen I write something in LibreOffice Writer (either after opening a brand new document or an old one), and then select the text I just wrote, and then right-click, then select Cut, then close the document (yes, without saving), then try to paste somewhere, I invariably find that there is no content in the clipboard.\nIs this a bug or does Ubuntu not have the Microsoft equivalent of a clipboard? if not, then what gives? Is copy paste only workable within certain data scopes?\nThe capability of copy pasting between programs seems pretty important. I've tested it out with one other program (Gedit), and it didn't lose the content. So I assume it is just a LibreOffice bug, as opposed to me misunderstanding the functionality.\n\nA: The problem with text vanishing from the LibreOffice clipboard in Ubuntu is discussed in some detail at this question: Clipboard: vanishing text on the Ask LibreOffice website where David says in his answer:\n\nThis is a system level issue, not to do with LibreOffice actually.  \n\nSo you should either save your documents before you close them, or else leave the document open until you have made sure that whatever you cut has been pasted correctly.

These tools help in determining what your system is doing during that time which would help you narrow down further. \nIf its not under any load, next thing to check is the number of files/inodes on same partition and the number of directory entries under /var/..for this use tools like dumpe2fs.  \nMy 2 cent's, let me know if you need more help.\n", "Q: Hardlink count inconsistent with matching files On searching for files that have hardlinks on my Portable HDD using the following command:\n$ find . ! -type d -links +1 -ls | sort -n\n\nI get an output of the following form (there are hundreds of other files)\n9336 244476 -rw-------   2 rishi    rishi    250342060 Feb 18 15:48 ./unigram_mvt_0.001_9_4_0.001\n\nThis shows that the file with inode 9336 has 2 hardlinks.\nOn trying to locate the other one using\n$ find /media/rishi/ -xdev -inum 9336\n\nI get the output shown below\n/media/rishi/mvp/unigram_mvt_0.001_9_4_0.001\n\nThis indicates that there is only file with inode 9336\nI have not created hardlinks myself.

I've been using Ubuntu 14.04 Live USB with persistence and it ran fine for the last two weeks. Last night, I was installing a bunch of apps (or at least, I thought I was) and I got a few errors after which the terminal froze. I had no idea what went wrong, so I just forced shut down and fell asleep.\nThis morning, I tried to boot my netbook and the screen went blank after the grub menu and just stayed like that. I figured I must've accidentally updated the kernel and it messed up the system. So I plugged in another USB with another OS in my netbook, booted, browsed to the drive where the casper -rw file was located and deleted it.\nThis solved one problem. I could boot into Ubuntu alright, except I just didn't have persistence. So is there a way to manually create the persistence file WHILE I'm running Ubuntu? I don't want to do another fresh install as I only have two drives (one for backup and one for Ubuntu) and my backup drive's running Porteus and it always fails to create bootable USBs due to some module issue.\nI would also like to know if there's a way to stop Ubuntu from updating kernel so as not to get in the same situation again in the future. Thanks! \n\nA: 1) To create casper-rw via terminal, you can can enter the following 2 commands one after the other, replacing 512 with any other number of MBs you want for your casper-rw file's size:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=casper-rw bs=1M count=512\n\nmkfs.ext3 -L casper-rw -F casper-rw\n\n2) To prevent kernel upgrades, you can install Synaptic Package Manager, select the installed linux image package(s) (linux-image-xxxxxxxxxx), and then choose Package > Lock Version from the menu.\n\nA: Boot with the boot option toram\nBoot (live-only) with the boot option toram to be able do to 'anything' with the boot drive, edit it or unplug it without affecting the running operating system.\ntoram makes the content originally from the iso file copied to RAM (and it will be mounted on /cdrom).\nNow you can unmount all partitions on the boot drive. It means that you will be allowed to edit the partition table, or even install an operating system.\nWays to create persistence\nYou can use the following methods to create persistence\n\n\n*\n\n*mount the FAT32 partition with read-write permissions and create a casper-rw file as described in the other answers to your question, a file with a file system inside.\n\n*if you are booting via grub, use gparted to shrink the  FAT32 partition and after that use the unallocated space to create a new partition with the ext2 file system or (ext4 file system and later remove journaling) and add the label casper-rw. This partition can be bigger than 4 GB, which is a big advantage. (Ubuntu cannot use a casper-rw partition for persistence in the same drive (the boot drive) when booting via syslinux, but it can if the casper-rw partition is in another drive.)\n\n*install mkusb temporarily and use it to create a new persistent live drive, but in this case I would really recommend that you get a new cheap USB pendrive, that you can use for the live system, and install the persistent live system into the other drive.\n\n*download and clone from a compressed image file to a persistent live system or an installed system (like a system is installed in small devices like mobile phones and Raspberry Pi).

It will look like:\n\n0x03800008  0 2138   [your_host_name] unity-panel\n0x0380000b  0 2138   [your_host_name] unity-dash\n0x0380000c  0 2138   [your_host_name] Hud\n0x0280000a  0 2213   [your_host_name] Desktop\n0x0380000f  0 2138   [your_host_name] unity-panel\n0x02c00078  0 2230   [your_host_name] Inbox - Mozilla Thunderbird\nThe last column is the window title. Match that to the application you are interested in.\nThe 3rd column is the Process ID. To find out the application that started that particular process ID use cat /proc/[the_proces_id]/cmdline. In the case of Thunderbird I used cat /proc/2230/cmdline and it produced\n/usr/lib/thunderbird/thunderbird.\nThunderbird is not a very good example because it uses a stub in /usr/bin which starts the real application located in /usr/lib/thunderbird/. \nJust starting /usr/lib/thunderbird/thunderbird however may or may not work and I do not recommend it. Instead you need to find out which program in /usr/bin (or maybe /bin) started the program you are interested in. To do that pass the program name to the program which, i.e. which thunderbird. It will give you the real program name, i.e. /usr/bin/thunderbird.\n", "Q: I want to setup Active directory in Ubuntu server for mix environmet (Windows/linux) to authenticate I want to migrate my all windows Server and workstation to linux system (Ubuntu server 12.04).

If you can see the reader and see a mountable partition, try mounting it manually (sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt — replace the sdX1 with the right designation from fdisk).

If you are willing to install and use byobu  as an interface to tmux to address this need, it makes it extremely simple to do what you are asking. In a terminal, run\nsudo apt-get install byobu\nsudo byobu-enable\nsudo -i\n\nFrom now on, when the root user logs in via the console, SSH, or with sudo -i, byobu will attach to an existing tmux session or create a new one if one is not already running.\nNote that I use sudo -i instead of sudo -s. The -s option only starts a shell, not a login shell. You should use sudo -i to emulate a full login, which also loads roots ~/.profile, and this is where byobu will install itself when you run byobu-enable.\nThere are probably ways to do what you want with tmux alone, but byobu makes setting up and starting tmux automatically very simple.\n", "Q: Will I get notifications for updates for packages in backport?

In your case that would be from 11.10 to 12.04 and then from 12.04 to 14.04. \nIf you have only 14.04 available you can write it to a bootable USB and boot from it. At some point during installing, before you can do any \"damage\" to your existing configuration you will be asked how do you want to install (e.g. alongside Ubuntu 11.10 and Win or erase Ubuntu 11.10, etc). This is the place to check: if you find the option to Upgrade 11.10 to 14.04 you're in luck.

I think it is mostly a hardware issue because earlier it had windows installed and after a few months, the system started hanging real bad (not the usual windows degradation).\nI am a long time Ubuntu user so decided to install Ubuntu on the laptop. However, it keeps on failing. I even tried install XUbuntu and it also fails.\nAlso, I could not figure out how to get the complete trace and hence clicked a photo of the console. If you need a complete log, it would be great if you can tell me what I need to do to capture it.\nYou can see the error below:\n\n\nA: Official Workaround for 14.04 upgrade kernel panic\nAs listed in LaunchPad, response #32\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/1269731\n\n1) Disable upstart re-exec whilst running the upgrade:\n\n    $ sudo su -\n    # mkdir /root/bin\n    # ln -s /bin/true /root/bin/telinit\n    # chmod 755 /root/bin/telinit\n    # export PATH=/root/bin:$PATH\n    # dpkg --configure -a && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nWith many thanks to James Hunt for the answer.\nOld Answer\nI was able to reboot, log back in and type\n\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nto get the package manager in a stable state.  If I saw it doing anything to DKMS or kernel modules, I hit Ctrl-C.  Once that completed, I then typed this:\n\nsudo apt-get purge dkms\n\nThat should remove DKMS and the associated modules that are causing the crash.  For me, it was the wl-broadcom drivers (when I was supposed to be using b43 + firmwarecutter)\nIf it doesn't happen at the same point in the upgrade process, (e.g. before a dkms kernel module), then you may have some type of hardware failure.  Typically it is disk, but it could be RAM.  Run an old version of PartedMagic or SystemRescueCd, and check out the SMART values on your disk.  Remember, there's a failure bathtub curve - lots of failures when the drive is ew, levels off a bit, and then spikes back up as the drive ages.  Used to be drive failure MTBF (mean time between failures) started to pick up at 40,000 - or about 4.5 years.  However, this was the 90s, when drives were meant to last 5 years.  Judging by the average warranty these days, drives are meant to last 2 - 3 years. If you get anything more than that, you are lucky.\nSo, good luck, and I hope a drive failure is not what you are observing.  Hopefully you configured your /home directories on another partition so that you can wipe / without wiping home (or can transplant it to another drive).  I wonder why distros don't suggest this by default?\n", "Q: tarball to another drive I'm just creating a tarball of a corrupted USB NTFS Windows drive which I mounted in /media.

You may be eligible for the student edition, which is cheaper. This is if you really want your own copy of Matlab, but if your uni provides you with computers with Matlab you can save on that and use computers at uni.\nThere is an opensource, free (you don't pay for it) software for ubuntu (and gnu/linux in general and other *nix systems) which has the same syntax and (basic) functionality as MATLAB.

This is recommended as it does not need to add PPAs. \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nwhich should work out of the box. This will install the gnome-shell and a series of default applications for the Gnome Desktop experience. You can install just gnome-shell if you want, but be warned that this would be an untested (and unsupported) configuration - the desktop configuration is made assuming the presence of the default apps(1). \nThis will install a package called gdm too, which is the \"Display Manager\" (the program that shows you the login screen --- and that will setup the basic graphic environment), and will ask you if you want to use gdm or lightdm (the original Display Manager of Unity). In principle you can choose one of them; in practice sometimes the Gnome Desktop misbehaves if you do not use gdm. \n\n*Use the new Gnome 3.12, with the PPA.  These are experimental packages, you can break your system, and you are supposed to do that only if you are confident you can manage the breakage (as clearly stated in https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3-staging) \n\n=== *WARNING* ===\nThe packages here have been deemed not ready for general use, \nthey have known bugs and/or regressions, sometimes of a critical nature.\nMostly things should run smoothly but be prepared to use ppa-purge,\nwhen you encounter issues!\n\nIf they break your system, you get to keep both halves.\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n(1) consider that this is normally not a problem. Linux application for one desktop will generally run on all the others --- I have Ubuntu Gnome with Thunar File Manager (from Xubuntu) and digiKam (from Kubuntu) photo manipulation program, and the only problem is that the \"graphical appearance\" could be a bit inconsistent... which I really don't care. \n\nA: Open terminal by Ctrl+Alt+Tand run following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe\"    \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\n", "Q: How to fix dual-boot installation of Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Win7? I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Windows 7 Ultimate and completely messed up. I downloaded the file and burned a CD. Got confused with the partitioning because I wanted to install it in my Drive D once my drive C is a Corsair Force GT ATA Device, 120Gb and has only 39GB free. The Drive D is 2TB and is completely empty. I had created 2 partitions in the Drive D both 500Gb big and the remaining 800Gb were not partitioned. After the installation I got a 19Gb partition that seems to be equally empty. I cannot at all see where Ubuntu is installed because I cannot identify any file. If I boot from the installation CD, it says that Ubuntu 14.04 is already installed - but Where?\nI ordered a new CD from Canonical. Does it contain an uninstall program? Is it actually possible to install in a second disk (Drive D)? If so Can I make the second disk bootable so that I can start it from BIOS without touching Windows? The computer is high-end and very powerful. Thanks.\n\nA: 1) Most probably you have installed Ubuntu just fine, and it's on your 2nd disk's 1st partition, but your BIOS settings make your computer boot from the 1st disk, where Windows is installed, and you naturally can't see the contents of your Ubuntu partition there (Windows can't see Ubuntu, but Ubuntu can see Windows ;-)\n2) This setup is actually very good for your purposes, as you can now change the BIOS Boot Settings and give your second disk (where Ubuntu is installed) first priority, and choose Ubuntu or Windows every time you boot your computer, or revert back to the previous BIOS boot priority to boot directly to Windows when you want it, and so on.\nYou need to press a key like F2, F10, F12 or Esc (which varies with different computer brands and models) at the black screen that appears immediately after pressing the power button to enter into BIOS Boot Priority Settings menu.\n\nA: Windows7 use NTFS Filesystem but Ubuntu use Ext4 Filesystem, and you can mount NTFS in Ubuntu, but win7 can't recongnise Ext4,that all \n", "Q: Crashed upgrade form 13.10 to 14.04 Today, I turned on my computer and upgrade Ubuntu to 14.04, since it is so long, so I went to have dinner.

I left it for an hour and finally force reboot the computer.\nI searched in forums and found a way to continue the upgrade(enter recovery mode shell and dpkg --configure -a however, when I reboot the computer again, the screen resolution seemed to be increased(the images looked to be more meticulous) but after I login, the mouse responded slower than that before update.

This way you can install it, and you still have all you files and settings, you just need to install your apps again, which is the only real downside.\nNow if you used the Ubuntu update tool, when you left, and let it go by itself, there may have been issues which you were not there to see, and correct. You should always stay when doing something as important as  upgrading your entire OS.\n\nA: I've had a similar issue when going from 13.04 to 13.10. \nTo fix unmet depedency hell, boot into a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get -f install\nThe f parameter here means it will try to fix broken dependencies. It is likely this will end with something like and x not upgraded.

I have an Asus notebook which I am trying to run ubuntu on. It has a Pentium M processor running in it.

It is my 2nd Ubuntu build.\n\nA: You just have to download the 32bit version for a system running a Pentium-M. I have a netbook running Ubuntu, and Mint, just have to use the 32bit version disks.\nIf the issue is you're unsure how to get the 32bit disk (the Ubuntu site always shows the 64bit in the download box), all you have to so, is when it brings you to the download link, where it says \"Choose your flavour\", just click on the dropdown menu under it, and you will see the 32bit version right there.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install ubuntu server (12.04) on gpt disk (3TB) and boot from it I have been searching for a guide on how to install ubuntu server on 3TB gpt partition, but with no luck. I wonder if it is  even possible ? I read that GPT cannot be used to boot with. Also, I would like to use LVM on that drive, so in my case I would have 2*3TB drives with with ubuntu server on it and extended partition with LVM for use of large amount of files. I'm new to linux so I hope its not a dumb question.\n\nA: Two types of firmware are in common use today, and the answer is slightly different for each of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) -- This type of firmware is as old as the IBM PC. It's very rudimentary; its boot process is to read the first sector from the hard disk and run the code it finds there. If that code is a boot loader that understands GPT, then a BIOS can boot from a GPT disk. There is a caveat, though: Some BIOSes (or some EFIs in BIOS compatibility mode; see the next point) flake out in one way or another when they see GPT disks. It's usually possible to work around such problems, but they can be difficult to deal with if you don't understand them. See my page on the subject for more details. Also, if you use GRUB 2 as your boot loader (which Ubuntu does by default), you'll need a BIOS Boot Partition to boot from a GPT disk. The Ubuntu installer sets this up by default, but you'll need to do it yourself if you pre-partition your disks.\n\n*Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) -- This type of firmware (more recent versions of which are known as the Unified EFI or UEFI) is a replacement for the BIOS. It boots in an entirely different way from BIOS, storing boot loaders and related files on an EFI System Partition (ESP). GPT is part of the EFI specification, so of course EFI-booting from a GPT disk is not a problem. Most modern EFIs have a BIOS compatibility layer, so you can boot a BIOS-mode boot loader on most modern PCs, but these often have GPT quirks, as noted earlier.\n\n\nLVM is not a problem with either method of booting, although if you use LVM, you'll do well to create a separate /boot partition outside of the LVM. You can use LVM with either MBR or GPT disks.\nThe term \"extended partition,\" BTW, is meaningful only with the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme. An extended partition holds logical partitions, and is a workaround for the 4-partition limit of MBR's primary partition table. GPT lacks this limit and so has no need of either extended or logical partitions. In your use, I think you didn't mean extended partitions, but rather an LVM volume group that holds logical volumes. A logical volume is much more flexible than a partition, but requires more complex tools to manage.\n\nA: I'm not sure about installing grub to a GPT partition table, but as for installing to one, that is entirely possible, and just as easy as on a regular MS-DOS partition table, I personally have a few distros on a 3tb drive that uses a GPT table. All you do is make the partitions, and install the system like you would any other drive.\nIf you have a spare small HDD, you could always use that, or even put grub onto a USB thumb drive, and boot off of that, just make sure to edit the device boot order in you system BIOS.\n", "Q: Problem with Gnuplot I want to draw graphs with Gnuplot. But when I click the button for the example plot sin (x), the gnuplot command window does not appear. I don't know the cause of that behavior\n\nA: gnuplot is a command-line program; you have to run it in a terminal emulator. On Ubuntu the keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+t is set to open a new terminal window by default, but you can of course also find the terminal emulator in the Dash (or main menu).\nIn the terminal window, you can simply type gnuplot to launch the gnuplot command prompt. In order to plot your example, sin(x), on the gnuplot prompt, you can simply type:\nplot sin(x) \n\nto obtain: \n\nThere is a great tutorial in the Gnuplotting page...\n\nA: I assume your problem might be not able to plot using Gnuplot after installing.

What makes this more interesting is it only depends on libc6 and libpng12-0, both of which are available in 12.04. I'd be confident you could just suck the package in from Trusty.\nStill, that's not a good habit to get into.

I am on the Debian Security Mailing list, and recently there has been a lot of traffic going back and forth about the security (particularly package updates) of Ubuntu vs Debian stable.  A guy on the lists asked this:\n\nI'm a new user of the great Debian distro for my Desktop. But when I talked to a friend and I told him, that I'm using Debian (Wheezy) for my desktop computer, he told me that I shoudn't use it because it is not secure. He told me to use Ubuntu instead. He explained that with the fact, that Ubuntu has more security features enabled than Debian (also more compiler flags for security) in a fresh install. He gave me a link to the following site:\n  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features\n  So, I'm very happy with Debian but because my friend seems to be an expert for Linux, I don't know if I can use Debian. Can you tell me which of the security features promoted by Ubuntu are also enabled in Debian?\n\nI was wondering if anyone had their two bits to add...\n\nA: I think first off it's good to remember that a system is only as secure as it's user.\nQuoting Joel Rees (In reply to that very question) here:\n\nSecurity is not a package you can buy or download. Whether you choose\n  Ubuntu or Debian, if you are concerned about security, you need to\n  spend time learning about it The partly out-of-date pages that Riku\n  gave you links to are a good place to start.\nThe first question I would ask (but don't answer me, of course) is how\n  good your passwords are. This will be an issue with any OS you choose,\n  even seriously secure OSses like openBSD.\nYour passwords should be at least ten characters, preferably twelve or\n  more, include alphabet and numbers and one or two punctuation marks.\n  One I used to use was something like \"MI\n  \n  The next question is whether you allow root login. (Again, don't\n  answer me, on or off list. Just check yourself.) If you allow root\n  login at all, use an extra strong password for root. You probably do\n  not want to allow root login from the network, but you may want to\n  allow root login from the console.\nChanging the port sshd listens to is also a good idea.\nDo not surf the web as root or as any administrator login id, of course.\nSpeaking of admin login ids, it's a good idea to have one non-root\n  login id that you only use for administrative tasks. And you should\n  avoid getting onto the web when logged in with the admin id. Which\n  means you need another id for general use, which makes two strong\n  passwords, three if you allow root login.\nIf you have a habit of downloading random apps from the internet,\n  unlearn that habit. Use your package manager instead, and think twice\n  or more about the apps that you can't get through your package\n  manager.\nAnyway, the basics of security are the same, whether you use Debian,\n  Ubuntu, Fedora, openBSD, whatever.\n\nBottom line: I don't believe a secure user will have much more trouble with one than the other.\n", "Q: Custom keyboard layout not showing in Settings I am trying to create a new keyboard layout where two keys are inverted with each other.\nThis is what I have done:\nEdit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se to add:\npartial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"kinesis\" {\n\n    // Modifies the basic Swedish layout to place aring correctly\n\n    include \"latin(type2)\"\n    include \"se(basic)\"\n\n    name[Group1]=\"Swedish (kinesis)\";\n\n    key <BKSL>  { [     aring,      Aring       ]   };\n    key <AD11>  { [apostrophe,   asterisk,        acute,     multiply ] };\n\n};\n\nEdit /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst to add to the section ! variant:\nkinesis         se: Swedish (kinesis)\n\nRestarted X.\nThis mentions something about rules/evdev.html, which I do not have (Ubuntu 14.04).

I also tried to clear /var/lib/xkb from *.xkm, no difference.\nHow do I make this new variant of the layout to show up in my Settings->Text Entry?\n\nA: I think you have to add the entry also to the file evedev.xml, something on the line of: \n    <variant>\n      <configItem>\n        <name>kinesis</name>\n        <description>My special kinesis</description>\n      </configItem>\n    </variant>\n\nNear where the other variants for the se layouts are defined. \n...and/or modify the correspondent base.xml, base.lst files. \nI really do not know exactly how it works, thanks to the quite sparse documentation, but I managed to have my Spanish variant working (tested in Xubuntu but should work in all DE... modulo bugs).\nAnd yes, removing *.xkm files is needed too.

You can either add a bind mount to the /run filesystem along with your other bind mounts before executing the chroot command\nsudo mount -o bind /run /mnt/run\n\nso that the chroot system picks up the host system's DNS settings or, once you're in the chrooted system, temporarily create a static /etc/resolv.conf with nameserver(s) of your choice e.g.\necho 'nameserver 8.8.4.4' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf\n\n", "Q: Open File as Other Program I want to configure Firefox to open .zip files with File-Roller.\nIn the options, I browse to /usr/share/applications/file-roller.desktop and it doesn’t open it as File Roller however nautilus easily does that.\nIts like that for every program.\nWhich folder can I find all the applications to open files with because this folder doesn’t seem to work.\n\nA: Choose the file /usr/bin/file-roller to make firefox to open zip files through file-roller.\nTake a look at /usr/bin directory.

In any case, you should probably use gparted if you need to format/partition a disk.\nI don't know of a GUI program to manage mounting, so I simply edit /etc/fstab or put a file in /etc/fstab.d/. The latter is probably the way to go. The file should have a single line for each paritition in the following format:\n/dev/sdXN <tab> /media/blah <tab> ext4 <tab> defaults <tab> 0 <tab> 1\n\nYou should replace the dummy data with actual values and the mount point should be a directory that exists. You can use an UUID instead of /dev/sdXN to allow you to copy the partition over to another disk later.\n\nA: An easy method would be to use disks or disk utility from the gui. This will provide information on disks, their sizes, their partitions and where they are mounted (if so). see below\n\nYou can also mount and unmount partitions from here. For permanent mounts\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab is your best bet.\n", "Q: touchpad does not stay disabled Is there a way to keep my touchpad disabled?\nI have a thinkpad E420s. I have disabled the touchpad because the built in buttons are too hard to click without moving the cursor.

I am not sure how to reliably reproduce this. It usually stays after a shutdown, or use of guest session but then sometimes it just appears on.\n\nA: Is it possible that the reason for your mousepad being enabled again is that you push a certain key combination on your keyboard?

This is used for example in organizations where there are many workstations and in order to identify them easily their hostnames have appended the domain name like client1.example.org, client2.example.org, server1.example.org and so on.\nThe domain-name-servers option specifies a list of Domain Name System (STD 13, RFC 1035) name servers available to the client. Servers should be listed in order of preference. This option is pushed by the DHCP server to clients to allow them to query the local DNS servers when they access the Internet.\nA DHCP server can push a lot more options than an IP address + subnet mask and gateway.

For my Ubuntu 14.04 setup, I have 4 LUKS partitions that work as backing block devices form my BTRFS root partition. Using the default settings I could not get the 4 encrypted partitions unlocked at boot time, so I wrote a script that would do that for me.\nThe script sort of works, sometimes when I boot I have no issues, other times, it boots into the initramfs prompt. I think there are timing issues between unencrypting the LUKS partitions, then assembling the BTRFS partition and then mounting the root subvol, but I have no idea how to debug/test/fix this. Any ideas of what could I do to figure out what is the problem?\n\nA: Use the \"debug\" kernel parameter, you will see more debug output at boot time, and initramfs will write a boot log to /run/initramfs/initramfs.debug.\nDebugging the actual boot scripts is usually slow work. You need to take the initramfs, unpack it (gzip -d init*.gz then cpio -vid < init*), modify it (begin at /init), repack it, then boot with it. Add print statements where you want to check what is happening at a certain point. The problem with race conditions is that adding debug prints can change the timing, resulting in different behaviour. There is no easy solution to that, other than reading the code and understanding what it is doing. Having said that, the scripts are short and should be pretty easy to follow (/init is only around 300 lines of code).\n", "Q: How can I install Google Hangout?

First is your graphics card supported by openGL. This is on the manufactures web site. If it's not you need one that is to get the video programs to work correctly. If it is, check for graphics drives in your additional drivers option in the software sources menu.Second the problem could be a temperature rise from the graphics card. When you go to watch the video your graphics card increases in temperature which raises the temperature of the system unit and ultimately the processes which will cause the system to shutdown. Check the temperature by using the Smart check option in your disks application. If you are running over 40 C your hot. If this is the problem make sure you have a nice layer of thermal compound on the processor and add fans, but most important a rear vent below the graphics card.

I think some package is corrupted (I don't know which) and I don't want to reinstall the OS (which will need a lot of energy and time to recusotomize).\n\nA: You first need to understand a few things.\nFirst, apt-get / dpkg / apt , by default, will not overwrite configuration files if they already exist.\nYou can over ride this behavior.\nsudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-overwrite\" install python-profiler\n\nsee : Force apt-get to overwrite file installed by another package\nThis is one of the reasons why, unlike other OS perhaps, re-installing a package typically will not fix a problem.\nYou can purge and re-install a package, as purge will remove config files.\nBut even a purge will not remove config files in your home directory.\nSecond, unless you manually edited a system file, reinstalling will not help as you did not really change anything. This is because user specific settings are stored in $HOME .\nThird, custom configuration files, for your keyboard or other settings etc, reside in your home directory.

I even tried installing Kubuntu over Linux Mint, hoping the newly installed GRUB would pick up the other OS but failed. What is next? Thanks for any help!\n\nA: If you go into BIOS and everything on the hardware end is working correct, then first try to run the file system check command from root. When you get to the Boot option screen select advanced options for Ubuntu 14.04. In the next screen select the highest number Ubuntu recovery mode, the number changes but the it's always chronological. When you get to the recovery menu, select root and enter, fsck -A , don't use the fsck selection it's actually a different command. Select Y for every option it gives. This could correct your problem. Then type exit. The recovery menu will then come back up. Select the network option to mount the file system it will return to the recovery menu when complete. Select dpgk ,this can take a wi when it finishes type exit. You will then return to the recovery menu and tell it to return to regular boot. If you can't get any boot menu or that fails, put a live disc of ubuntu 14.04 in, and select reinstall ubuntu. If this doesn't work, I NEED MORE INFO to help. TTFN, the toachGmon  \n\nA: First HRDWARE - Make sure your BIOS boot option order matches your order of OS install, I explain later why. Using the Windows disc now will only create problems with the Linux distros if that needs to be used I explain when and how later. If you don't even have a BIOS menu, make sure if your using a video card that your video is connected to the card and not the motherboard I/O . SECOND SOFTWARE - If your connection is good try the file system check from a Live session the goal being to get you to GRUB to be able to get to the recovery mode. Here's the procedure. Boot into a live session with the Ubuntu install disk. Select Try Ubuntu. When your desktop comes up, press cntl + Alt + t to open the Terminal. Use the fsck -A from the terminal in a live session. After that go ahead and try a reboot. You hopefully will then be able to get to GRUB and go into recovery mode. The important thing here is to pickup with the the select network step and then select dpkg option. If this still won't work, don't address the OS as a whole but individually. First - Use a Live DVD to back up files and folders. Second -  You disconnect the drives that Linux are on. Windows removes other boot loaders. Linux does as well but you can avoid the defult process of installing linux along side, which it does even if its on another disk unless you tell it other. Therefor your problem is in your bootloaders. XPs was removed and because of the different linux distros you can't get your GRUB menu. For the Window XP repair you need your recovery console or command prompt safe boot to run the fix mbr process, you can google the commands your looking for and steps. After Windows XP fix mbr is done you can reconnect all drives and do the Linux. When you get to Linux install select do something else and tell it the target drive. Remember filesystem is ext4 , mount point is root ( / ) , and to leave 4gb at the end of partition, in that 4gb create a logical partion and select linux swap. Your will ultimately wined up with the GRUB menu with all your options. The GRUB version used will be determined by order of install and your BIOS boot option order must match so do Ubuntu 14.04 last and the oldest first.Sorry about the long rewrite long day yesterday. If this fails at some point I need more info. Good luck \n", "Q: Do I need a swap partition for every Linux distribution? To install various Linux distributions on the same physical machine, do I need to add a swap partition for each distribution, or one will suffice for all?\n\nA: I assume you are asking about a swap partition.\nYes you can share a swap partition, but each time you install, the swap space will be reformatted. This will change the UUID of the swap partition and you will need to update /etc/fstab in each installed os.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nYou will see an entry similar to: \n\nUUID=cee15eca-5b2e-48ad-9735-eae5ac14bc90  none  swap  sw  0  0\n\nList your partitions with\nsudo blkid\n\nand update fstab with the new UUID.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\n\nA: Maybe is solution to add swap like swapfile. You don't need partition for swap and each distribution have his swap.\nTake space to make swap\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576\n\nCount is size of swapfile\ncreate swap file system\nmkswap /swapfile\n\nTurn on swap\nswapon /swapfile\n\nEnd at the end change /etc/fstab\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nadd line \n/swapfile       none    swap    sw      0       0\n\n\nA: Yes, but...\nThe big restriction if you share your swap across distros is that you will be unable to use hibernation/suspend-to-disk.  This uses the swap space to store the current contents of RAM, and if you boot into one distro while another is hibernating, it'll clobber the hibernation information.\n(Mixing hibernation and dual-booting is a bad idea in general, because the hibernated data may include cached information about the contents of the hard drive, and the actual contents of the drive may change if you boot into one OS while another is hibernated.)\n", "Q: What is autopoint? I need to install autopoint. I tried by using \nsudo apt-get install autopoint\n\nBut it says E: Unable to locate package autopoint.

I want to hide grub menu. I'm using grub 2.02~beta2-9. I tried following combinations of /etc/default/grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*\\#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=1  \n\\#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true  \nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\ngrub menu is visible for 10 seconds (if timeout is set for value larger than 0 it is displayed correctly: GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 - 5 seconds delay)\n\n*GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=1  \nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true  \nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0 \n\ngrub menu is visible, I also tried GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=false and setting both GRUB_TIMEOUT and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT to zero and non-zero values\n\n*\\#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=1  \n\\#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true  \nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1  \nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\n\ngrub menu is visible for 1 second, tried also GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown with the same result, if GRUB_TIMEOUT is set to 0, 10 seconds delay\nAfter each change I type update-grub and restart computer to see the results.\nAccording to GRUB documentation found in info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration' second way is deprecated. The right way is the third one - by using GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE, but unfortunately it doesn't work. It's probably some kind of a bug.\n\nA: I have found a very quick solution, but I haven't looked at the consequences yet.\nIn your os_prober script for update-grub there are some lines to by-pass the timeout you set and to force displaying a boot menu if an other os has been found. You can easily disable this by setting the \"quick_boot\" variable to 0.\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/grub.d/30_os_prober at the beginning of the file change\nquick_boot=\"1\" to quick_boot=\"0\"\n\n*Then run sudo update-grub\n\nA: Normally if you had only one OS running the option GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 would work.\nIf GRUB 2's os-prober identifies additional operating systems while running the /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober script the hidden menu timeout feature is disabled by conditional statements. This also disables the ability to use the Shift key to display the menu during boot. Users with multiple operating systems wishing to hide the menu can find script edits on various forums which will allow them to add a hidden timeout feature to the boot sequence.\nCheck this answer if it helps you.\n\nA: I tried editing 30_os_prober, but it turned out that the name has been changed to 10_os_prober.\nOther than that the solution offered above by Motsah works perfectly for me.\nI now have:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"0\"   \nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=\"1\"   \nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=\"true\"    \nGRUB_TIMEOUT=\"0\"\n\nin my /etc/default/grub\nChanging the hidden timeout to a higher setting doesn't seem to do a thing.

It seems to increase the speed proportional to the net increase in total resolution available in the dual monitor setup.  Which would seem that the track speed is based on some sort of display resolution percentage, not number of pixels like I had expected.\nDoes anyone know if this is indeed how the touchpad configuration works? And if there is a way to prevent this, or do I need to go in and decrease my track speed by about half every time I plug in an external monitor?\n\nA: You're not the only one to experience this and unfortunately there is no fix. Users have reported this behaviour since 2010 and it has been an open bug since 2011.\nHaving explored the various suggestions in those links, until this bug is fixed, I think the only way is to adjust the speed manually each time\n", "Q: anacron not working I have a clean install of Xubuntu 14.04 32-bit, and anacron doesn't seem to be working.\nI read that it's better to use a cron job to trim SSDs, and that Ubuntu has a cron job to do that, so I removed discard from /etc/fstab. I wanted to confirm that the cron job was working, so I added an echo command to /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim so that it looks like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n# call fstrim-all to trim all mounted file systems which support it\necho \"Trim started on\" $(date) >> /home/dominic/Desktop/Trim_Runs\nset -e\n# This only runs on Intel and Samsung SSDs by default, as some SSDs with faulty\n# firmware may encounter data loss problems when running fstrim under high I/O\n# load (e. g.  https://launchpad.net/bugs/1259829). You can append the\n# --no-model-check option here to disable the vendor check and run fstrim on\n# all SSD drives.\nexec fstrim-all\n\nIt runs fine from a terminal, but it never runs as a weekly job. So I moved it to cron.daily, but it never runs from there either. So I moved it to cron.hourly, and it does run every hour. The echo text appears in the file, and the drive light comes on for about two minutes. But cron.hourly does not use anacron.\nHere is my crontab file. I have changed some of the times, but it didn't seem to work with the original times that came with Xubuntu either.\n# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab\n# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'\n# command to install the new version when you edit this file\n# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,\n# that none of the other crontabs do.\n\nSHELL=/bin/sh\n PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n25 16   * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report      /etc/cron.daily )\n47 6    * * 1   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n#\n\nI tested to see if it would run correctly from my user's crontab by putting the following into crontab -e. Then I waited a few minutes until 8:10 pm, but nothing happened.\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n10 20   * * *   test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nI think it must have the correct syntax for run-parts, because it does run when I move the script into cron.hourly.\nIt seems that cron is working but anacron is not. So my question is, what can I do to get anacron working?\n\nA: I got anacron working on my system, as follows:\nIn /etc/fstab I have some directories moved to tmpfs to avoid writes to the SSD, like this:\ntmpfs   /tmp       tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noatime,mode=1777   0  0\ntmpfs   /var/spool tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noatime,mode=1777   0  0\ntmpfs   /var/log   tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noatime,mode=0755   0  0\n\nThis means that /var/spool/anacron/ does not exist at boot time, and as a result, anacron does not function. The three files in this directory must be preserved across system boots for anacron to work. So I created a directory /usr/local/etc/anacron/, and at boot time I create /var/spool/ and put a symlink in it that points to that directory. Now anacron is working because its three files (cron.daily, cron.weekly, and cron.monthly) are preserved across boots.\nActually, I create a bunch of directories at boot, as described here:\nHow to fix anacron & cups-pdf when you have /var on tempfs but I modified the script so that it doesn't create /var/spool/anacron but instead it creates the symlink mentioned above.\nThe resulting script looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Script to create required directories in tempfs /var/log (that are not otherwise created).\n# This script is needed because I have some directories moved to tmpfs in /etc/fstab.\n# That means these directories disappear every time I shut down.\n# Programs should create them if they do not exist, but some, like anacron, fail to do   so, and then fail to run.\n# So I create them here. I don't know where it gets the permissions from, or whether they are right.\n# Thanks to http://blog.philippklaus.de/2011/02/ssd-optimizations-on-linux/ for the list below :-)\n\nfor dir in apparmor apt ConsoleKit cups dist-upgrade fsck gdm hp installer lightdm news ntpstats samba speech-dispatcher unattended-upgrades upstart; do\n  if [ ! -d /var/log/$dir ] ; then\n    mkdir /var/log/$dir\n  fi\ndone\n\n# And in /var/spool.\nfor dir in cups-pdf; do\n  if [ ! -d /var/spool/$dir ] ; then\n    mkdir /var/spool/$dir\n  fi\ndone\n\n# Create the symlink.\nln -s /usr/local/etc/anacron /var/spool/anacron\n\nThe above script is in my home directory and is run at boot time by a command in /etc/rc.local as described in the linked article.\nMaybe the real solution to this problem would be for anacron to store cron.daily, cron.weekly, and cron.monthly in a directory that the user is not likely to move to tmpfs.\n", "Q: Video generator for any audio I have some audio files.

But what I want is to have the video file (with the audio) to upload to YouTube.\nHow can I achieve this? Which program(s) should I use? Or which commands to type in the command line?\n\nA: Here's a not so elegant way of doing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install RecordMyDesktop from the Software Centre.\n\n*Fire up one of those programmes that produce the \"moving images\".\n\n*Record the \"moving images\" window with RecordMyDesktop (it also captures the sound).\n", "Q: Very Low Temperature Reading for graphics driver using lm-sensors I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 and got the package lm-sensors.

You can see that if you take a look at libcurl3-dev (which is a virtual package and points to libcurl4-openssl-dev:\nNo current or candidate version found for libcurl3-dev\nPackage: libcurl3-dev\nState: not a real package\nProvided by: libcurl4-openssl-dev (7.47.0-1ubuntu2), \n    libcurl4-openssl-dev (7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2)\n\nThe above snippet was taken on Ubuntu 16.04 but this will probably look similar on 14.04.\n", "Q: cant fix grub 2 and gparted shows unallocated disk i have been dualbooting ubuntu 14.04 and windows xp, but some days ago, i saw on the grub 2 screen the partition windows rescue enviroment and i clicked it.\nafter that, i saw the following:\nno such partition \nentering grub rescue>\n\nafter that, anything i clicked on (ubuntu or win xp) would only display the same screen.\ni turned it off, and turned it on again but it wouldnt even display the grub menu, just the grub rescue.\n i thought i could fix it with my live usb (ubuntu 13.10), by downloading boot-repair, but the wifi administrator does not work, it only displays this:\nvpn connections      >\n(check mark) enable networking\nedit connections\n\nand, i entered to gparted trought my live usb and it only displays \nunallocated \n149.05 GiB\npartition   -     file system       - size\nunallocated (!) - unallocated       -  149.05 GiB\n\ncan you help me to fix my laptop, im desperated! im on exam week and all of my homework, exam guides, and 17 gigs of photos from a trip to Florida and i cant lose anithing from there\nim on another laptop\nsorry for my bad eanglish, it is not my main language\n\nA: If you're very very lucky, the problem is modest damage to your partition table, which FixParts will repair more-or-less automatically. See the program's documentation for details on how to use it.\nIf you're less lucky, you'll need to use TestDisk or something similar to recover your original partitions. This program actively scans for filesystems and creates a new partition table to hold anything it finds.\nIf you're unlucky, your filesystems have been partially or completely overwritten, in which case your only hope is to use PhotoRec or something similar to recover individual files. This process is almost certain to be tedious, and you may end up sorting through files to figure out what they are, since PhotoRec does a poor job of recovering filenames. Also, you must have another physical disk on which to store the recovered files.\n", "Q: How do I enable microphone \"sidetone\" in Ubuntu? One of the main reasons I prefer gaming on Windows rather than Linux is that the Logitech driver (for windows) allows me to enable microphone \"sidetone\".

I can hear a jingle when I try \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" and \"Install Ubuntu\" options but it's still a black screen.\nI have Intel i5 4570, GTX 750 Ti with 4GB of RAM.\nI do have Ubuntu 14.04 installed right now but I want to totally reinstall it. \n\nA: This is simple! Took me a while to work it out, but I had the same issue, and it turned out it was using the onboard Intel GPU!\nEven if your BIOS has your Nvidia card as default, for some reason, Ububtu still uses the onboard card, so it is actually booting, you just cant see it!\nThe solution: Go into your BIOS and disable your onboard video. When you reboot, leave the black screen for a few minutes, and the mouse should appear.\nThis may not working in all situations, but its an easy thing to try first!\n\nA: Wait longer.\nI have an Intel i3-3225, 8 GB RAM, GTX 750 Ti. I booted 14.04 off a 2GB usb stick and chose \"Try Ubuntu without installing\". I got the black screen and thought I had replicated your error, but after waiting a while the mouse showed up, then waiting a little longer the desktop displayed. So if you haven't yet, try waiting several minutes.\nIf waiting longer doesn't work, shout down your PC and unplug your graphics card from the motherboard. Your processor model has Intel HD graphics which has better supported drivers than that brand-spankin-new graphics card does. Do your fresh install of Ubuntu on the Intel HD Graphics. When that's done, shut it down and plug your card pack in.\n\nA: During boot (bios or black screen and white text appears on UEFI.)  For MultiSystem LiveUSB, at your chosen boot option in the menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press e and add nomodeset before quite splash words.\n\n*Press F10 and it will continue to boot in non 3d mode\n\n*Install ubuntu as usual\n\n*On first boot, use again nomodeset as described in first statement\n\n\nthen;\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update & upgrade\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-337 #( don't install that before command above)\n\nthen;\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand change it to\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nsave & close\nthen;\nsudo update-grub\n\nrestart.\n\nA: Simply start the Ubuntu installation using the Intel IGP (Integrated Graphics Processor) instead (make sure to modify this option in the UEFI Bios). When you finish the installation, download the linux drivers for your graphics card, install them to be able to use your graphics card and you'll have it done.\n\nA: I had this issue on two machines, both running Debian (so not exactly ubuntu but close). I tried various kernel parameters like nofb and nomodeset but without success.\nOn one of the machines MicWit's suggestion of disabling the onboard graphics in the bios fixed the blank screen issue but left X unusable. The screen was both blurry and blocky as if the image had been downscaled and then re-upscaled, text was unreadable. \nOn the other machine MicWit's soloution made no difference but what did work was renaming /lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/drivers/gpu , this prevented whatever the borked driver was from loading and fixed the blank screen issue. X11 was somewhat usable after doing this but was stuck at 1024x768.\nIn both cases after dealing with the blank screen issue I had to install the Nvidia binary driver to make X11 work properly.\n", "Q: Cannot boot as directed from thumbdrive I've downloaded the basic Ubuntu,opened it with FileOpen (as recommended) and tried to run it rebooting my PC. It will not automatically run from the thumbdrive (opens Windows) and it will not run when I deliberately choose the thumbdrive (opens nothing whatever). I've deleted the thumbdrive contents and reloaded it a couple of times, with and without choosing everything showing on FileOpen (I get the same files opened either way).\nI really want to try Ubuntu, but simply cannot get it to run. Any suggestions to accomplish this would be appreciated. I'm not PC savvy, but willing to try.\n\nA: I had a similar issue.  I tried the Boot Menu (F12 during startup) and changing boot priority in my BIOS (Delete during startup).  Still would not boot from my USB.  I even completely wiped my hard drive, and it would not work.  I probably had some setting screwed up.  The bootable thumb drive worked perfectly on one PC, but I just could not get it to work on the other.\nI ended up creating a boot DVD, and it worked perfect.  So if you are having trouble booting from a USB, maybe you should try the DVD route.  Just a suggestion.\n"]
