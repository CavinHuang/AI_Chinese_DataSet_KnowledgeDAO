["Q: My 2TB external drive keeps disappearing every time I boot my Mac I have an external LaCie Porsche 9223 2TB drive connected to my Macbook Pro 15 (2015) via USB3. After I converted it to APFS after upgrading to macOS High Sierra, it keeps disappearing randomly from Finder/Disk Utility and the \"/Volumes\" folder, and nearly every time I boot my Mac.\nThis is what puzzles me though:\nIf I clean/remove the Dyld shared cache via Onyx, the drive shows up momentarily on the desktop/Finder sidebar with (seemingly) no problems whatsoever. Disk Utility reports that the disk is OK. The next time I reboot: poof, gone .\nDoes anyone have a clue what's going on?\nAnd why the \"dyld shared cache\" cleanup is like a magician's reappearing trick every single time? If I only knew why that works, I would probably/most likely find a way to prevent it from happening again.\nBest regards,\nAndreas\n\nMacbook Pro (2015), macOS High Sierra 10.13.2, 16gb RAM, 500gb SSD \n\nA: After upgrading to High Sierra, I had the same issue with my LaCie shared not listed in shared devices, coupled with SMB hanging without connecting to remote servers.\nThe SMB issue was solved by changing the SMB version to v2 in the /etc/nsmb.conf configuration file and rebooting the Mac as recommended in this post on SMB share deadlock. After the reboot with the new /etc/nsmb.conf, shared devices were again correctly listed in the sidebar including my LaCie shared disk, so I surmise both issues are linked.\nThe /etc/nsmb.conf file I use is:\n$ cat /etc/nsmb.conf\nstreams=yes\nsoft=yes\nsigning_required=no\nprotocol_vers_map=2\nfile_ids_off=yes\n\n", "Q: Does ctrl-A and ctrl-E on a mac work the same as HOME and END on Windows? Coming from a Windows Machine to a Mac - one of the things I missed was the HOME and END keys when editing a text document. \nThen I discovered:\nctrl-E # move cursor to end of line\nctrl-A # move cursor to beginning of line\n\nWhich seems to do the same thing. \nI'm wondering if this making too much of an assumption or I'm missing something. Although I've tested it, I'm asking the question because there might be a different scenario I've missed that makes it different. \nMy question is: Does ctrl-A and ctrl-E on a mac work the same as HOME and END on Windows?\n\nA: In fact this convention is coming from the Emacs text editor on Unix.\nWindows copied it 30 years later :).\nOf course, this is working in:\nemacs\n\nand these 2 shells which inherited the editing line shortcuts of emacs:\nbash\nzsh\n\nand these Apple graphical interface software:\nCalendar\nMessages\nNotes\nTextEdit\nLibreOffice\nPages\nFinder\n\nOn the other hand, this convention is failing in:\nvi\n\nand I suspect in some other softwares which have their own set of shortcuts without enough freedom to keep these very old and useful ones.\n\nA: Answer is Yes, at least in TextWrangler and TextEdit :)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016 (Touch Bar) in “Critical Update” loop So my MacBook Pro has been experiencing some weird issues after an unprompted and unexpected shut down. When I turned it back on, it claimed there was a “critical software update” and asked to choose a WiFi network. So I did so and it installed and after two minutes it was done. However, the USB C ports on the left side had stopped working. I was using a satechi adapter and removed it to find that the charging cable only works on one of the two ports now. The right side ports will work with the adapter usually. I did a SMC reset and reinstalled High Sierra, so before I do a full wipe I want to see if anyone can give me an answer.\n\nA: Weird enough I just had this, I unplugged all the USB-C devices and then did a power cycle and it booted fine. I think it's time to build a backup computer.\n\nA: I solved this by using my mobile hotspot - for some reason my office/home wifi kept going in a loop. Might be worth a try?\n\nA: I had a similar solution. At home i had that Problem. Via WiFi and LAN Cable. at the office it just worked at the first try.\n\nA: Uninstall Hands Off! in Safe Mode boot and reboot Mac.\n\nA: Happened to me recently. It could be related to a hardware/firmware issue with the touchbar. Resetting the NVRAM (holding down CommandOptionPR at boot up) seemed to help. The problem has not reoccured since then (4 days ago)\n\nA: Some generic “fixes” like nvram/pram reset won’t solve or help for this issue.\nFull clean install, installation on top of existing only fixes this half way. If you want to avoid a reinstall - try this workaround:\nctrl+alt+shift+power to turn off the device\nConnect your macbook to the network WIRED\nwith usbC->ethernet\nor \nusbC->thunderbolt,thunderbolt->erhernet, just like me\nTurn the device on. The boot takes longer but it boots!\nI did this 10 times to reproduce every time with the following results:\ndisconnected wired network, restart == critical update loop\npower down with key combination, connect wired network, power on == booting\nI have no persistent remedy for this issue.\nEveryone please try this, and edit this to be more clear if there’s a workable and repeatable solution here.\np.s. This workaround seems not to work on encrypted machines.\nI just now figured some weird plist files inside /Library/LaunchDaemons/\nActually a script of my own... Anyways it seemd to block the embeddedOS activation.\nWhen moving it to the LaunchAgents it boots fine now.\n\nA: Have had this the past few days and have some information which may be of use here -\nPrograms like 'Hands Off' and 'Little Snitch' (essentially ingoing/outgoing network traffic blockers/gatekeepers) were the cause of this not installing for me - if this happens, then boot into safe mode (Hold down shift when turning on) and disable the program, then restart and install.\nAs a side, conversations with apple advised that these updates are to do with the OS that runs the touchbar (among other things) therefore, if you can get into safe mode, this should confirm its not a hardware issue. \n\nA: Weird, Tried every combination except full reset... \nTried to connect it through a MIFI device using USB-C converter... System restarted with an exception BSOD ... restarted and It worked OK...\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I later got to find out a security update that failed to download completely because my WiFi went off was the cause. I connected to a different network and voila!\n\nA: Having the same problem, it passed the critical update screen after several retries. Running diagnostics also does not show any problem. \n\nA: So today I had another look at the laptop with this looping issue.  Having tried nearly anything else I decided to replace the display.  THE LAPTOP NOW WORKS FLAWLESSLY!\nBooted to the OS without issue.  When I installed the original display the problem re-occured.  With a new display the touch bar is working fine, MRI passed, touch bar diags passed and the unit is booting and rebooting without any critical update requirement.\nFinally!\n\nA: *\n\n*Try to replace the whole top case with Touch Bar assembly.\n\n*Try to replace the LCD.\n\n*Should pass the critical update, but if it's not working, there might be some problem with the logic board.\n\n", "Q: How to find out whether my MacBook Air supports memory management unit (MMU) virtualization for Docker? I'm planning to install Docker on my MacBook Air (Early 2014): Intel Core i5, 4 GB RAM. I need Docker to be able to run SQL Server on my Mac (as I understand this is the only way to run it). However, there are some system requirements that I should meet to be able to run it.\nSystem requirements from Docker website state this:\nMac hardware must be a 2010 or newer model, with Intel’s hardware support for memory management unit (MMU) virtualization; i.e., Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode. You can check to see if your machine has this support by running the following command in a terminal: sysctl kern.hv_support\nWhen I run this command, sysctl kern.hv_support, in Terminal, I receive the following output: kern.hv_support: 1\nWhat does it actually mean? Can someone explain? Does it mean that I can run Docker on my Mac?\n\nA: There is complex way to find out whether your processor meets the requirements:\nsysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string\n\nWith the details (e.g. i5-4260U) go to Intel Product Specifications, search for the proc and check the Specifications > Advanced Technologies:\nIntel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) ‡                    Yes\nIntel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) ‡   Yes\nIntel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT) ‡                Yes\n\nIf these three features are supported, Docker will run.\nA simpler check is sysctl kern.hv_support. If the command yields 1, the Hypervisor.framework required by Docker is supported on this processor.\nThe most simple method is to download and try to run Docker. If you get a \"Fatal error. Incompatible CPU detected.... \" your proc doesn't meet the requirements.\n\nEven restricted to an older processor you will be able to run Windows & Microsoft SQL Server in a type 2 hypervisor like VirtualBox, VMware Fusion or Parallels though. Some $bucks are required though.\n", "Q: Is it possible to automatically exit full-screen mode in Safari on cmd-tab press? I have a problem that while watching videos in Safari in full-screen, I need to access another program, but at the same time keep watching the video, in not-full-screen mode though. Currently if I cmd-tab from full-screen of Safari to another program, that covers only a part of the screen,\nI get this in my Safari window:\n\nHow can I switch to non-full-screen move automatically after using the combination of alt+tab?\nOr is there any alternative that could be tailored to my need?\n\nA: As far as I understand your problem, when you are in full screen video, you can switch to normal video size by ⌃⌘F\n(And switch between Apps by ⌘TAB, not ⌥TAB)\n", "Q: 5K Display (only one) and MacBook Pro mid-2015 DG Radeon 370x Which 5k displays supports by my MacBook Pro mid-2015 with Radeon M370x and how it's done?\nIs some one saw articles or tests about MBP 2015 and 5k displays?\nRight now I'm replacing my two old fullHD 24\" displays and after few weeks of tests I don't like two 4k 27\" displays... I returned them.\nI don't want two displays anymore...\nI want one but ultrawide (21:9), for now I'm thinking about LG 38UC99-W with 3840x1600, but soon there will be new 5k ultrawide LG 34WK95U with resolution 5120x2160.\nFirst LG 38\" 4k works with my MacBook but if MBP works with 5k displays... there will be possibility that it will work with 5k Ultrawide...  \n\nA: Per the technical specifications, your MacBook will support a maximum resolution of 3840x2160 which is technically UHD 4K (16:9)\nCan you connect a 5K display?\nYes, but it will show at the 4K resolution if you use one Thunderbolt cable.  If you use two, you can drive a 5K and the display must support MST (Multi Stream Transport).  In this scenario, only one external display is supported.\nSee Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac for more details.\nBottom line: you can only display up to the maximum that your source can push.  In other words, you can drive two monitors at 4K or one at 5K\n", "Q: Dual boot: I cannot boot in OS-X, after installing Linux (Debian) After swapping the DVD drive with an SSD, I installed Debian Linux on it.

What concerns me about your output from diskutil list is that there is no label given for disk1s1. Your comment states you can not mount this volume. My conclusion is the FAT32 volume was never created in this partition. One possible explanation is your installation of debian never completed correctly.\nAnother possibility is you have not included all the steps you preformed before posting your question. For example, it is fairly unlikely the debian installer added partition with the identifier of disk1s5.\nIf you had installed Debian correctly to your second internal disk, then you have to preform the following steps in macOS to finish the installation. Here, I assume 64 bit version of Debian was installed to use the EFI boot method.\nThe steps below copy the boot file for grub to the correct location in the EFI partition. This is not only a requirement for the Mac Startup Manager, but is also defined in the UEFI specification.\n\n\n*\n\n*From a Terminal application window, enter the command diskutil mount disk1s1. A new device representing this partition should appear in the Finder application. If you view the contents of this volume a Finder application window, you should see the same as in the image below.\n\n\n*Using the Finder application, navigate to this device.\n\n*Create a folder labeled boot in the folder EFI.\n\n*Copy the file grubx64.efi found in the EFI/debian folder to the EFI/boot folder.\n\n*Rename the  grubx64.efi file in the EFI/boot folder to bootx64.efi.\n\n*From a Terminal application window, enter the command diskutil unmount disk1s1.\n\n\nIf you can boot to the correctly installed Debian operating system, then the above steps can be replaced by commands given below. These commands need to be entered in a Debian Terminal window.\n\nNote: To enter these commands, you will have to know the root users password.\n\nsu\nmkdir  /boot/efi/efi/boot\ncp  /boot/efi/efi/debian/grubx64.efi  /boot/efi/efi/boot/bootx64.efi\nexit\n\nOnce the changes are made, you can do the following to choose an operating system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start or restart your Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Startup Manager appears. \n\n*Select the icon for the desired operating system. Debian will appear with label EFI Boot.\n\n*To boot the desired operating system, select the arrow below the chosen icon .\n\n\nNote: If you hold down the control key while selecting the arrow, the chosen operating system will be come the default.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*To boot back in OSX, at startup: press [Alt] key.\n\n*To boot Linux, at start up: press [Command]+R.\n\n", "Q: iPad Air heats up and burns through battery after IOS update When all the apps failed, I was forced to update IOS to the latest two weeks ago.

Last month I could watch many hours on 80% \nIs there a method (setting) to monitor clock speed and temperature?  \nIs there a setting to slow the clock speed?\n\nA: Apple's diagnostics would capture some logs but you'd need Apple to tell you which apps are stuck or chewing through the battery / CPU / energy.\nI would focus on checking your last backup and erase things selectively.\nIf you want to erase slowly:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset all settings and then power cycle - that's quick but usually doesn't fix this\n\n*erase all content and settings - then connect to power and do light web apps Safari - don't sign into iCloud, don't restore the backup, don't install any (or many) apps.\n\n\nRun with the stock OS that was causing the problem without your data or apps to convince yourself that it was your programs and data. If you still see the power drain, then restore the device from iTunes or Apple Configurator or have a technician do it.\nTLDR:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's hardware - none of these will fix it.\n\n*If you had a corrupt iOS - the restore from USB will fix it\n\n*If you had programs crashing and data continually trying to update (software bugs or such) - the erase all content and settings will fix it.\n\n*If a trivial setting got stuck and you needed a minor fix - the reset settings will fix it.\n\n*The last thing it could be is simply a process that takes a long time to finish.

This playlist should not include songs that I skipped recently. My current rules look like the following (see the screenshot):\n\nHowever, the iTunes still adds songs that I skipped. How can I make it to exclude songs that I skipped recently?\n\nA: The rules look correct.  The problem may be in what YOU consider a skip versus what iTunes/iOS considers a skip.  There's varying reports that a skip in the first 3 seconds doesn't get counted, a skip in the last 10 seconds doesn't get counted, etc.\nMaybe the best thing to do is this:\nCreate another smart playlist RecentlySkipped with one rule: Last Skipped IS IN THE LAST 1 days.\nThen alter your existing playlist by replacing the \"last skipped\" rule with \"Playlist IS NOT RecentlySkipped\".\nYou can then play around with playing tracks and skipping them at various times - in the first 2 seconds, in the first 10 seconds, in the first 15 seconds, in the last 15 seconds, etc.  Then check the RecentlySkipped playlist to see which ones got added to it and which ones didn't.\nAlso, the play and skip count logic has been changed from release to release in the past.  So it's possible, for example, that what counted as a skip in iTunes 12.6 is not counted as a skip in iTunes 12.7 or vice versa.\nAlso, in older versions of iTunes you could reset play count independently of resetting skip count.  More recent versions reset both counts whether you want them both reset or not.\n", "Q: Is \"/private\" just an ordinary directory or does it have special properties The nominal links\n /etc --> /private/etc,\n /tmp --> /private/tmp and\n /var --> /private/var \nare all straightforward and I understand they are there because of a legacy need that has passed. Nothing magical about them.\nHowever, I just saw these install instructions for an Apache/httpd module which recommend using /private/libexec instead of /usr/libexec. That directory doesn't exist but I can create it via sudo. So, I am wondering if /private has some special properties such that /private/libexec is merged with /usr/libexec?\n\nA: There is no magic at works here, this will just create a user-writable directory to store the module in. You can‘t copy it into /usr/libexec/apache2 as this is protected by SIP. \nUsing /private like this seems kind of odd though. I would probably create /usr/local/libexec/apache2 and install the module there.

Is that possible at this stage?\n\nA: Not with Disk Utility (can't specify custom mount points with Disk Utility) but the macOS installer environment has Terminal. With Terminal, you can run:\nmount_apfs /dev/disk1s3 /Users\n\nReplace disk1s3 with the identifier of the volume to mount there.\nThis should answer your question about mounting during installation, but after a reboot your disk will be unmounted and /Users unavailable.

You accidentally partitioned the drive instead of erasing just a volume.\nAccording to your statement your drive contained two partitions previously:\n\n\n*\n\n*First partition: 280 GB\n\n*Second partition: 1720 GB\n\n\nAfter repartitioning the drive only one partition is left:\n\n\n*\n\n*First and only partition: 228.4 GB\n\n\nThis probably means that the second partition wasn't affected - only the entry in the MBR was removed.\nYou should be able to recover the partition by simply adding a second partition in the MBR.\nTo detect the former boundaries of the lost partition you have to search for specific strings on the disk which determine the first and last block of a (former) NTFS volume.\nThe specific strings are either NTFS or BOOTMGR/bootmgr. \nThe content of the block depends on your locale, so searching for \"BOOTMGR is compressed\" (found in an English NTFS Partition Boot Sector) is not necessarily successful. \"BOOTMGR\" (English/German) or \"bootmgr\" (Spanish/French?) should work though. I haven't tested non-latin Windows systems.\nExamples \nFirst block of a German NTFS volume:\n\nLast block of a German NTFS volume:\n\nThis can be done by dd'ing the device to grep.\nExample:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 bs=512 skip=2048 count=512 | grep -o -a -b \"BOOTMGR\"    \n421:BOOTMGR\n512+0 records in\n512+0 records out\n262144 bytes transferred in 0.010566 secs (24810155 bytes/sec)\n\nThe explanation of the command:\nCopy /dev/disk2 with a block size of 512 Byte to stdout, but skip the first 2048 blocks of disk2 and stop after (another) 512 blocks, pipe it to grep, treat the output as text, search for \"BOOTMGR\" and finally show the byte offset(s) of the matched pattern in front of the respective matched line.\nIn your case the result 71010552671:BOOTMGR of sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 bs=512 skip=446333006 count=150000000 | grep -o -a -b \"BOOTMGR\"means:\nThe byte offset is 71010552671 Byte after the last block (block 446333006) of the currently existing HDD1 volume on disk1. In blocks that's the relative block 138692486 or the absolute block (446333006 + 138692486) = 585025492.\nThis means two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your previous partition 1 probably had a size of ~ 299 GB (= ~278 GiB) instead of 280 GB\n\n*Your partitions aren't aligned properly to 4k blocks because neither 446333006 nor 585025492 are divisible by 8\n\n\n\nThe last block of the vanished NTFS volume can be expected in the last 10,000 blocks of disk2. The appropriate command to search for it is then\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk2 bs=512 skip=3907019167 count=10000 | grep -o -a -b \"BOOTMGR\"\n\nWith the result of the command you can determine the last block of the vanished partition 2.\nWith the first block and the last block you can add the lost partition with fdisk to the MBR.\nTo crosscheck the size you can extract the partition size in sectors in the partition boot sector at offset 0x028 and field length of 8 Bytes and the sector size at offset 0x0B and field length of 2 Bytes.\nIn the example screenshots above that's FF E7 DF E8 00 00 00 00 (= 3906988031+1) and 00 02 (= 512 Byte).\nThe diskutil info output for the example volume (visible in the screenshots) is:\n...\nDisk Size:                2.0 TB (2000377872384 Bytes) (exactly 3906988032 512-Byte-Units)\nDevice Block Size:        512 Bytes\n...\n\n\nA: There is only one partition on your external drive. I suspect that instead of erasing the first partition, you erased the entire drive. But if this were true, then the new partition would span the entire drive. So at this point, it would be best to try and find the missing partition. \nThe correct function to find the header of a missing NTFS partitions is given below. To use this function, you will need to first copy this function and then paste as a command in a Terminal application window.\nfindntfs() { sudo bash -c \"for i in {$1..$2};do xxd -a -s \\$[\\$i*1000000] -l 1000000 $3|fgrep -a -b 'NTFS    ';echo -en '\\r'\\$i:;done\";echo done;}\n\nBelow is a example of its use. I have a 4 GB NTFS formatted flash drive. The output from sudo fdisk /dev/disk1 is given below.\nDisk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 968/128/63 [7811072 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: 07    1   0   1 -  967  81  18 [      8064 -    7803008] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\nSince the flash drive contains 7811072 sectors and the sector size is 512 bytes, the drive size is exactly 3999268864 bytes, which is the product of the two numbers. If wanted to search the entire flash drive for a NTFS partition, I would need to search from 0 MB to 3999 MB of data. An example of using findntfs to do this is shown below.\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ findntfs 0 3999 /dev/disk1\nPassword:\n3:70:003f0000: eb52 904e 5446 5320 2020 2000 0208 0000  .R.NTFS    .....\n3998:1125334:ee5ffe00: eb52 904e 5446 5320 2020 2000 0208 0000  .R.NTFS    .....\n3999:done\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ \n\n\nNote: While this function is executing, you will see values being updated. This is current megabyte being searched. From these values, you can determine the progress of the search.\n\nThe important information to extract from this output are the hexadecimal values 003f0000 and ee5ffe00. These values are the offset in bytes for the first and last sectors of the NTFS partition.\nBelow is the compute value of the byte location of the first sector based on the value shown from the output of fdisk.\n8064 * 512 = 4128768 = 0x3F0000\n\nBelow is the compute value of the byte location of the last sector based on the value shown from the output of fdisk.\n(8064 + 7803008 - 1) * 512 =  3999268352  = 0xEE5FFE00\n\nBoth of these values match the output from findntfs.\nIn your case, I would suggest looking for the beginning of your missing partition somewhere around 270 GB to 290 GB. For this, the command would be as shown below.\nfindntfs 270000 290000 /dev/disk2\n\nOf course, this may take a while. If you feel lucky, you can try narrowing your search.\nI would suggest looking for the ending of your missing partition somewhere around 1980398 GB to 2000398 GB. For this, the command would be as shown below.\nfindntfs 1980398 2000398 /dev/disk2\n\nThe function below looks into the found sector and prints out the number of sectors occupied by the candidate NTFS partition. The input is the offset of the partition in bytes and the drive name.\nntfssectors() {(n=$(sudo hexdump -e '1/8 \"%u\"' -s $((0x$1+40)) -n 8 $2); echo $(($n+1)))}\n\nBelow is an example where this function is used.\n\nNote: The input is assumed to be hexadecimal.\n\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ ntfssectors2 003F0000 /dev/disk1\n7803008\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ ntfssectors2 ee5ffe00 /dev/disk1\n7803008\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ \n\nThe output from both functions is the same as from fdisk.\n", "Q: Homebrew Python not linking Im trying to follow some tutorial where you install OpenCV but they require me to have the output of which python be /usr/local/bin/python.

I don't think I have a static IP from Comcast.\nQuestion(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible with the equipment I have to create two separate WiFi networks that can't see each other?\n\n*If so, would that be adequate protection for my Macs and home devices if the smart sprinkler somehow got hacked?\n\n*If yes to both of the above, how do I set it up?\nSo far, I've been able to create two WiFi networks, but haven't been able to get them both connected to the Internet without them obviously sharing the same underlying network. For example, I can print from WiFi network #1 to the wireless printer attached to WiFi network #2.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Apple networks do this well with the guest network. All the \"suspect\" devices only get to go to the internet and not infect / snoop / attack the trusted machines on the proper network. Many other network vendors have the same idea - either by making separate VLAN for the sequestered / DMZ devices as needed.\nIt doesn't make sense to address each of the separate questions since each would be a long several paragraphs. Perhaps narrow down on one item once you've chosen to set up your network and can document it and ask the subquestion with details needed for a more narrow answer.\n\nA: Have you tried device isolation?\nYour Comcast cable modem may have a feature called \"device isolation\" or something like that.\nIf so, just plug your two airports to your cable modem, and create a new network for each AirPort in the AirPort Utility App.\nThey would share the same gateway but I figure, they wouldn't be able to communicate witch each other.\n", "Q: Minimum charging voltage for an iPhone 6 I am creating a solar panel charger for my iPhone. For the charger I need to know the minimum charging voltage for the phone to begin to charge. \nWhat is the minimum voltage required for an iPhone to begin to charge?\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure you're asking the right question, because voltage is different to current.\nAll iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, etc) charge at 5 volts. So, if all you need to know is voltage, then 5 volts is the official requirement for charging.\nHowever, the rate at which a device will charge is partly dependant on the rate at which the charge is flowing (known as current). I say 'partly' because the state of your iOS device also has an impact (e.g. it will charge quicker if it's not being used, it will charge slower if you're watching YouTube videos, etc). \nSo, in summary, iPhone chargers are typically rated at 5 volts and 1 amp while iPad chargers are rated at 5 volts and 2.1 amps. \n", "Q: On iPhone and iPad, how do I get the latitude and longitude number from the Maps app or Google Maps app?

Is there anyway to get the 'sort by name' to sort alphabetically such that 0 < 9, a < z, and numbers < letters?\n\n\nA: Apple OS X uses \"natural\" sort order in which a string of digits is considered as a unit.\nThe Apple documentation is in the Finder section of this page. \nAn old article on Finder sorting that may still be useful is here.\nI think Terminal may sort the way you want.  There are also several 3rd party alternatives to the Finder which may offer that kind of sorting.  \n\nA: I was confused why 080c30.png was coming after files that started with numbers greater than 0 (ex: 1c0f28.png).\nI followed the link to the documentation shared by Tom Gewecke above. It says:\n\nSubstrings of digits are sorted according to their numeric value, as opposed to sorting the actual characters in the number.\n\nIn this case, the leading substring of digits in 080c30.png is \"80\", which is greater than 1 (in 1c0f28.png). There is no way to change the sort behavior for finder afaik, but yes you can sort the files in terminal or via 3rd party apps to get the behavior I was looking for.\n", "Q: Desktop and Documents in Finder In the Finder of my new Mac, there are two things I don't understand:\n1) in the sidebar Desktop and Documents are placed under iCloud.\n2) the Desktop and Documents folders are not shown in Macintosh HD ==> Users ==> SoftTimur in Finder, even though in a terminal we can see that they are physically in the folder of SoftTimur.\nDoes anyone know why it is like that?\nPS: ls -lO returns\ntotal 0\ndrwx------@  5 softTimur  staff  -  160 Dec 21 10:50 Applications\ndrwx------@  5 softTimur  staff  -  160 Dec 22 22:29 Applications (Parallels)\ndrwx------@ 13 softTimur  staff  -  416 Dec 22 17:41 Desktop\ndrwx------@  5 softTimur  staff  -  160 Dec 22 17:41 Documents\ndrwx------+ 20 softTimur  staff  -  640 Dec 22 21:53 Downloads\ndrwx------+ 63 softTimur  staff  - 2016 Dec 21 20:47 Library\ndrwx------+  5 softTimur  staff  -  160 Dec 22 17:41 Movies\ndrwx------+  6 softTimur  staff  -  192 Dec 22 17:41 Music\ndrwx------   4 softTimur  staff  -  128 Dec 22 22:45 Parallels\ndrwx------+  6 softTimur  staff  -  192 Dec 22 17:41 Pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x+  4 softTimur  staff  -  128 Dec 20 16:41 Public\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 softTimur  staff  -  160 Dec 22 22:34 Startup\n\nPS: in Mac Finder:\n\n\nA: It is like that because your Documents and Desktop folders are stored in iCloud. Thus, they are no longer shown in your Home folder (the folder with your username) as they are now in the iCloud one.\nThis mean that files in Documents and Desktop are stored both locally on your Mac and online on iCloud as long as there is enough space available on your disk.

There is recent news (acknowledged by Apple) of a feature in some software versions of iOS that reduces the current usage of the iPhone6 and 6S when the battery ages and is less able to supply current, and this makes sense. It tries to prevent the phone from suddenly shutting down when the battery can not supply the required current.\nI've suffered from those shut-downs first hand by trying to get the last few weeks out of a clearly-dead battery - which is unadvisable to say the least!\nIs it known for a fact if this feature reinstates the phone to original performance and speed after the battery is replaced?\n\nA: It seems that the CPU throttling will stop once device's battery is replaced.\nIn a statment to TechCrunch, Apple says they will throttle devices \"only when needed.\"\n\nLast year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions.\n\nAs this happens \"only when needed,\" replacing the battery should stop CPU throttling from happening. Explaining his experience with the same issue, Forbes contributor Antony Leather says that performance did increase on his iPhone 6 after replacing the battery.\n\nMy iPhone 6 was a prime candidate - I had actually replaced the\n  battery myself a couple of years ago, but I'm a heavy user and already\n  noticed its longevity had started to decrease again...\nFinally, I replaced the battery with a new one from Amazon, charged it\n  to be well away from the low power mode level and re-ran the test. The\n  difference was incredible. The single core score rose from 1038 to\n  1562 - an increase of precisely 50%.\n\nCheck out Forbes' Boost Your iPhone Speed By 50%: How To Replace The Battery And Stop Apple Degrading Performance\nCheck out this excerpt from How-To Geek's You can Speed Up You Slow iPhone by Replacing the Battery, which suggests that replacing the battery will improve performance.\n\nIf your phone is indeed slowing down as a result of poor battery health, replacing the battery will give your phone new life. Not only will you get a longer-lasting battery by replacing an old one, but your phone should jump back up to its top speed.\n\n\nA: I replaced the battery on my iPhone 6s and the cpu is still throttled at 600 MHz.  Run a cpu MHz year after swap and you will see the truth that it’s the software update that is the issue. \n\nA: Not sure why someone is downvoting these alternate observations, but I have similar experience.\nI just replaced my son's iPhone 6 battery with a new third party one that seems technically ok (coconut and a few battery apps I tried claim full capacity, voltage and no prior charge cycles). Still the CPU is throttled to 839 MHz at full charge and 600 MHz at lower charges.\nEDIT: tried a DFU restore too, didn't help\n\nA: I replaced my battery on iPhone 6 and it's still throttled the same as the previous battery. At 100% charge it's only 1127 MHz vs spec of 1400Mhz. At lower charges it decreases to 600 MHz. \nAll battery indicators (coconut, and multiple battery apps) say that voltage is at 4.2V (at full charge) and capacity is at 1810 mAh, so technically a perfect battery. Note that it's a 3rd party battery not an apple one. \nI wonder if they're punishing users for not using OEM batteries. All tech indicators say that the battery is in good health and throttling should not be happening.\n\nA: Not really. Mine went down to 600 - 911 MHz after just 18 charging cycles.\n", "Q: Unable to format USB flash I am trying to format my USB flash in ExFAT format to make it work on both Mac and Win devices.

It's been going for too long. The following things are the sequence of some key events in this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both of me and him own iPhones\n\n*I changed my number (same provider but different number, but did not change my apple ID). I also put my new number in the \"my number\" entry in the settings and did the same things to all my apps and blocked his number.\n\n*Four Months later, I receive a message from an unknown number and I asked who it was and it turns out it is the stalker to my surprise\n\n*his number in the form +61-4xxx-xxxx which is a standard Australian mobile number was showing at the top in his message (like the attached image although please note that the thread if not the actual message from him but it is a similar example as the text bubbles were blue and gray were showing in the thread from him yesterday)\n\n*I never put my new number on FB or anywhere\n\n*When I asked him how he found out my number, he just said \"I just replied to the same conversation in our conv\" which I think is a lie\n\n*Yesterday, I changed my number again, and this time even my apple Id and blocked his new number. Reflected the new number in all apps\n\n*He works for a major telco company and has about 10 smart devices and probably unlimited number of sim cards. This is not the first time he tried contacting me from different numbers. Because his work involves testing phones, he is quite knowledgeable with iphones\nMy question is: how he could've texted me although I got a completely new number? Is he telling the truth? Or do you guys think he somehow got a hold of my new number from someone? Is it because I did not change my apple Id and he was indeed able to get to my by getting a new number and imessaged me? I do not understand the imessage versus sms business. Please help me, so I know how to prevent him from getting my new number.\nThanks. \n\n\nA: If the message is in a green bubble, it came as sms, if it's in blue, is came through Apple/iMessage. If you go into the Messages settings on your phone, you will see Send & Receive addresses and you should see how his message arrived. It will probably your apple id email there and he won't need your new phone number.\n", "Q: Does Photos get confused when tagging a person whose face is not visible? I want to tag the people in my photos, even if their faces are not visible. Does this confuse the facial recognition function and reduce the success rate? Is there another way to tag people?\n\nA: In a sense, yes.  Photos uses facial recognition algorithms that improve their accuracy through acquiring more data with which to reliably match a person’s face.  This is why you are asked to mark wrong matches as well as correct ones, as this all helps the software produce more reliable results.\nTagging a person with no face will feed false data to the algorithm, which will then believe it should start searching for faces that look more like an elbow, or something.\nThe application itself during the earlier stages of tagging alerts you with a recommendation only to tag faces that are clear, and to avoid even blurry, out-of-focus faces, or faces that are turned to the side.\nI, personally, ignore those two particular rules, and at the end, it is your decision how you choose to tag photos.  There’s nothing inherently wrong with doing what you’re doing if you’re content to match more photos manually than relying on the facial recognition engine to do it for you.\nAddendum: One idea I can think of as an alternative means to tag people in photos without compromising the facial recognition effectiveness would be to use keywords, i.e. to create one keyword per person comprising a first and last name.  This will have the benefit of making the photos searchable by a person’s name in a similar fashion to searching for a face.\n", "Q: How should I recover my NTFS partition that I have accidentally deleted on my Mac I have a 2 TB external HDD that was divided in 2 partition:\nFirst partition: 280 GB\nSecond partition: 1720 GB\nI accidentally delete the second partition.\nHere are several steps that I already did;\nresult of diskutil list\n~ diskutil list\n  /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n     0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0\n     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n     2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         249.8 GB   disk0s2\n\n  /dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n     0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +249.8 GB   disk1\n                                   Physical Store disk0s2\n     1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            119.9 GB   disk1s1\n     2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 20.5 MB    disk1s2\n     3:                APFS Volume Recovery                503.9 MB   disk1s3\n     4:                APFS Volume VM                      5.4 GB     disk1s4\n\n  /dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n     0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2\n     1:               Windows_NTFS HDD1                    228.4 GB   disk2s1\n\nHere is the result of sudo fdisk /dev/disk2\n~ sudo fdisk /dev/disk2\n    Disk: /dev/disk2    geometry: 243201/255/63 [3907029167 sectors]\n    Signature: 0xAA55\n             Starting       Ending\n     #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    *1: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    206848 -  446126158] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n     2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n     3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n     4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\nEDIT:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 bs=512 skip=446333006 count=150000000 | grep -o -a -b \"BOOTMGR\"\n\n71010552671:BOOTMGR\n71010552692:BOOTMGR\n150000000+0 records in\n150000000+0 records out\n76800000000 bytes transferred in 11355.441546 secs (6763277 bytes/sec)\n\n\nA: The NTFS volume has been recovered in a TeamViewer session.

Using the date/time stamp already gives collisions due to camera burst mode, and multiple photographers.  I would like to assign each incoming asset an asset number composed of model+serial number+shutter count.  This generally works for mainstream cameras, but it doesn't work for iPhone.  Is there an app that would add this in automatically?\n\nA: No, Currently there are no apps which would be assigning shutter count / serial number etc. Apps like that would have to keep on working on background and then edit Metadata of photos. On iOS, editing photo would need user's permission and would trigger an alert view saying \"Do you want app to allow modify the photo\" etc.\nSo, creating such app is technically impossible on iOS without Jailbreaking. \nAlso note:\nThere are apps like \"EXIF Viewer by Fluntro\", which allows you to view shutter count of photos you took on Nikon Camera etc. It also allows you to edit exif tags like Camera model, software etc.\nDisclaimer: I have developed the EXIF Viewer by Fluntro App :)\n\n", "Q: Replacing Retina Display with non-Retina Display? My retina display in MacBook pro 2013 model broke. Part Number: 661-8153. Apple store said it will cost me $430 to get it replaced. I don't want to spend $430 on this old MacBook pro. What are my options? Can I instead put 2012 non-retina display or any other display to it which will cost me less? Right now, I removed the display assembly and connected it to an external monitor via HDMI port and using it like a desktop.\n\nA: No, you cannot unfortunately do that. The rest of the graphics hardware inside the MacBook Pro (up to and including the cables) are meant for that Retina display. You cannot just replace it with a non-Retina display (unless you connect it via the external ports with for example HDMI).\n", "Q: Why is the Recovery volume's version of Disk Utility more powerful than that on the main volume? I'm running MacOS 13.2 on a mid-2014 MBP (11,3). I have a 2 TB external HD (Seagate Slim, spinning disk, GUID format) that was partitioned into two 1-TB volumes.  Recently, using my main volume's Disk Utility, I deleted one volume and expanded the other to 2 TB.  This action corrupted the drive: (1) while the partition map said the volume was 2 TB, Finder's info. window said its size was unchanged, at 1 TB; (2) Disk Utility's sidebar incorrectly depicted the volume as a separate device, rather than a volume on the existing device (it didn't indent it); and (3) First Aid failed.\nI thus attempted to erase and reformat the drive.  That also failed.  I called AppleCare, and the advisor told me I should instead boot into the Recovery volume and try that operation from within its version of Disk Utility.  That succeeded, on the first try. The disk is now behaving properly.\nQuestions:\n1) Why was the version of Disk Utility on the Recovery volume able to succeed where the standard version failed? The AppleCare advisor's confidence in the Recovery volume's version suggests this was not a fluke—i.e., that it's understood the latter is more powerful (and/or that it's somehow able to operate more powerfully from within the Recovery volume).\n2) Given that the Recovery volume's version of Disk Utility appears to be superior, is it generally advisable for me to perform any future operations to modify or delete volumes using that version, rather than the one on my main drive?\n\nA: Disk Utility is the same between the regular OS and maOS Recovery, but the environment it's running in is different, and that affects what it can do. The biggest constraint is that Disk Utility can't do much to things (e.g. volumes) that're in use. My guess is that some program had a file open on the volume, so it couldn't eject the volume, and therefore couldn't repair or erase it. In my experience, the background process that scans and indexes documents for Spotlight searches tends to be a culprit here.\nIn Recovery mode, almost nothing is running (including no Spotlight indexer!), so Disk Utility is much less likely to run into this sort of conflict.\nBTW, there are some things that Disk Utility can do when running from the regular OS but not in Recovery. One I've run into is resizing the startup volume (if it's MacOS Extended format -- not sure about APFS). The reason for this is that the Recovery HD partition is right after the startup volume, so it needs to be moved if the startup volume is resized. But you can't move it if you're running from it!\n", "Q: Rename home folder to match account name (High Sierra) My home folder name (bob 1) does not match my account name (bob)\", but I want it to.\nHow I got here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Got a new Mac\n\n*Didn't have the cables to transfer from previous Mac, so I just set up a simple test account with my same username \"bob\"\n\n*Once I had the cables I created a new account called \"Admin\" and then logged in as that account and deleted my previous test user account \"bob\" in System Preferences.\n\n*Migrated data from old Mac.\n\n*This resulted in a new account called \"bob\" but the home folder for that account was named \"bob 1\". I discovered that my deletion of the test \"bob\" account had not actually deleted the home folder called \"bob\".\n\n\nWhile logged in as \"bob\" (which might have been a bad idea) I tried deleting the home folder called \"bob\" (from terminal) and then editing in System Preferences to change my home folder to \"bob\". After restart it walked me through the full setup and I realized it created a NEW home folder called \"bob\", and my old folder was still called \"bob 1\", except now my account was not associated with that folder (with all my actual data). So... restored from Time Machine.\nNow I'd like to do it right. So - \n\n\n*\n\n*I have a working account named \"bob\" that is linked to home folder \"bob 1\". I don't want to rename the account, just rename the home folder and have my account properly link to it.\n\n*I have an orphaned home directory named \"bob\" that I can delete via Terminal easily enough.\n\n*How should I go about renaming the home folder and maintaining (or re-establishing) the association between my user account and the renamed home folder? Or should I just give up and live with \"bob 1\"...\n\n\nA: Per Apple, assuming you're on OS X 10.7 or higher:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the orphaned home directory.\n\n*Log out of the account you're renaming, then log in to a different administrator account.\n\n*Go to the Users folder on the startup drive. The Users folder contains the home folder of the account you're renaming. Rename that account's home folder.\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Users & Groups.\n\n*Click the lock, then enter the administrator name and password that you used to log in. \n\n*From the list of users, Control-click or right-click the user that you want to rename. Choose Advanced Options from the shortcut menu.\n\n*Change the “Home directory” field to match the new name that you gave the home folder in the Users folder.\n\n*Click OK, then quit System Preferences.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Log in to the renamed account, then verify that your old files and folders are visible and the account is working as expected.\n\n", "Q: Murus internet sharing not working I have Murus 1.4.12 and am following the directions to share my internet connection from en0 (static IP connected to Comcast modem/router) through en3.  Both the client and server are macOS High Sierra 10.13.1.  I am successfully able to share it via System Preferences -> Sharing.  Regardless of Murus, I am able to use en3 as a network device and ssh into the host over it -- just cannot share internet.\nAfter resetting pf to its default state via Murus, installing boot scripts, and restarting, I create an NAT group with 10.0.0.25/32 (en3's IP) with access to all services.

It is a technology built into the firmware of your HDD or SDD that reports on the health of your drive.  It's not something that can be disabled. \n\nAfter I installed iStat Menus my launchd job immediately threw me a\n  popup saying me to backup all my files. I checked with Disk Utility\n  and I saw S.M.A.R.T. status as Unsupported.\n\nThis is because there is a system service residing at the hardware layer that's intercepting responses from the drive's S.M.A.R.T. reporting.  Disk Utility is attempting to send a request to the drive to report back on it's status and iStat Menu is (for a lack of a better word) grabbing the result; no result comes back - thus it's \"Unsupported.\"\nRegarding your script....\nWhile your script in and of itself is good, Disk Util's \"S.M.A.R.T. Status = Verified\" is nothing more than the \"check engine light\" on a car's dashboard.  It tells you something is wrong, but not what and only  after something has failed.  This is about as useful as closing the barn door after the horse escaped.\nS.M.A.R.T. has a number of attributes that Disk Util doesn't monitor nor report on.  To get comprehensive reporting and more granular data as well as thresholds that will warn you of impending failures, look to tools specifically made for this type of task.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Smartmontools (Free, CLI based)\n\n*Disk Drill.

However, I  prefer the \"pro\" tools designed specifically for this type of task.  Smartmontools is sufficient for me, but for clients who aren't comfortable with a CLI, I recommend either Disk Drill or Drive Dx\n", "Q: Make Safari load background tabs I think this is new behaviour since Safari 11, but I'm not absolutely certain.\nI tend to leave Safari open all the time, with several pages of tabs, each for a different 'subject'.\nOn relaunch - if I've been cleaning less savoury cookies etc, or even that rare occasion I reboot - it used to reload all the tabs, whether currently visible or not.  \nThis behaviour has changed & now each tab I go to will be blank & not load until I actually switch to it. I understand the philosophy might be to save resources until you 'prove' you actually need them, but honestly, if I didn't need them they wouldn't be open in the first place.\nI've actually developed the habit of quickly flicking through all the tabs just after launch so I'm only seeing the irritating delay once.\nFurther irritation - the version it loads after the 2 second pause is still the cached version, so you have to immediately refresh it anyway:/\nSo I'd like to eliminate this behaviour.  \nI want, if possible, that each tab is already loaded with the current, not cached, version of the page at the time Safari was launched.

They are stored as Events (e.g. Summer 2015), making it very easy to quickly find an individual picture.  I also have an iPad and iPhone 5, both with 64GB memory on which I store all my vital pictures (by selecting certain albums from my Mac when synchronizing). This ensures I have two back up devices.  \nHowever, within the last two weeks all my albums have disappeared from all three devices; all I have are the individual pictures (all 30k of them). Where have my albums disappeared to? There is no way I can recreate each album (even if I remembered all the names) and then copy the relevant pictures into each album - it would take years.  \nCan anyone help me recover the albums loaded with the pictures they contained?\n\nA: Unless you actually backed up your photos, they are, unfortunately gone.\n\nThis ensures I have two back up devices.\n\nThis is an incorrect assumption.  What you did was ensure that you had two devices that were selectively synchronized.\nThere's a major difference between synchronization and backing up.  Synchronization keeps changes consistent across all devices.  This includes deletions.  Backing up makes a copy of the file(s) for safe keeping.\nIf you delete a photo, file, album, and it's synced with multiple devices, that deletion will propagate across all your devices.  If you had those same files backed up to a USB drive or another service (like DropBox or OneDrive) anything you accidentally deleted would be available for recovery.\nAs for your albums - they are \"containers\" that allow you to organize your folders.  If you deleted these containers, the change synched across all your devices.  As inconvenient as this is, consider yourself fortunate that you didn't lose your photos and think of this as a wake up call to implement a proper backup procedure before you inadvertently lose all your photos.\n", "Q: Shared Google Calendars are not synced to iOS Calendars In Google Calendar I have a shared calendar called \"Public Holidays\".

Say you have a \"config\" file  ~/config.conf and in it you assign some variables:\n# Config file for MyScript.sh\n\n$user = Me\n$pass = S3cr3t5!\n\nIn your script you source the file so you can use the variables you defined:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource /Path/to/config.conf\n\nstuff= \"thisismydatastring and my saltbits\"\n\necho  $stuff | openssl aes-256-cbc -k $pass -base64\n\nPersonally, I like to keep the line that executes the command as clean as possible using variables (like stuff in the example above) so that it's easier to see what the command is doing and consequently easier to debug.\nIs this safe from prying eyes?  Yes, for the most part.

Window id’s are normally assigned incrementally, so a recent window will have an id of greater numeric value than those that came before it.\n    tell application \"Firefox\" to get every window\n\nshould return a list of all windows referenced by their id numbers, e.g.\n    {window id 59 of application \"Firefox\", window id 2408 of application \"Firefox\", window id 61 of application \"Firefox\", window id 60 of application \"Firefox\"}\n\nOf course, I wonder how running multiple, separate instances of Firefox will affect this, as I can't predict whether AppleScript will send the get windows command to all Firefox instances or just one (and, if so, which one?). \nIf that line works as I want it to, then you can pick out the one with the smallest id and close the others.  Here's one way to do that:\n    tell application \"Firefox\" to get the id of every window\n\n    set W to result\n\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to space\n    do shell script ({\"echo\", W, \"| tr ' ' '\\\\n'\", \"| sort -n\"} as string)\n        --> Outputs lines sorted from smallest to greatest value\n\n    set W to first paragraph of result\n\n    tell application \"Firefox\" to close (windows whose id > W)\n\n\nA: With some help from this answer I was able to print the IDs and the names of all the processes that currently run.\nI then ran a few tests and these are my insights:\n\n\n*\n\n*The processes are sorted by most recent.\n\n*The Firefox processes that Selenium opens are named \"firefox-bin\", as opposed to the usual \"firefox\" process/es.\n\n*Hence the IDs' order matches the names' order, so it allows to cross between the lists and identify the windows that Selenium has opened.\n\n\nThe code I used is:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get the name of every process whose background only is false\nset _name to result\ntell application \"System Events\" to get the id of every process whose background only is false\nset _id to result\n\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to space\ndo shell script ({\"echo\", _name & \" \" & _id, \"| tr ' ' '\\\\n'\", \"| sort -n\"} as string)`\n\nIt's not optimal, but I just needed to get the right IDs, so this test was enough for me to move on.\n", "Q: High Sierra contacts disappear immediately after creation I add a contact (Firstname, Lastname, Phone, Email) and save it.\nAfter a few seconds, presumably when macOS tries to sync it to Gmail and/or iCloud, it disappears.\nI have a Gmail account and an iCloud account synced, when I add the contact via the Android app, it stays in the Gmail address book and it gets synced into macOS.\nAt first it seemed to work again, when I disabled the iCloud Account.

With a new harddrive purchase I decided to encrypt it before moving all the data there.\nI have followed some tutorial regarding encrypting the drive and have used disk utility to create and encrypted image on a 2TB Seagate hardrive, encrypted image is 1.8TB. When trying to move my data I realised that the speeds are horrendous and moving directly to the encrypted image is much slower than moving to the unencrypted part of the harddrive. Below is the comparison:\n\nHere same files are copied to encrypted and unencrypted parts of the drive. Writing speed is about 18x slower for the encrypted part. I have seen in a related answer that a disk image encryption is much slower than the partition encryption. Hard drive is HDD, I have USB 3.0 port as well as cables for both drives.\nWould speeds be much more favourable if the whole drive was encrypted?\nWhat is the best way of encrypting a harddrive that will not affect the read/write speeds too much and will be mainly used with a macbook?\nThanks\n\nA: Of course writing on an encrypted partition is slower than writing on an unencrypted one, because any writing operation goes through the encryption algorithm.\nFor the same reason, writing on an encrypted disk image is slower than writing on an unencrypted disk image.\nBut, what you are comparing here is writing on an encrypted\ndisk image EW(x) (x is the number of bytes to write) which is then written on an unencrypted filesystem W(x), against writing directly on an unencrypted filesystem W(x). And of course:\nEW(x) + W(x) > W(x)\n\nIf you would like to measure correctly the overhead introduced by encryption you should compare writing directly on an encrypted filesystem against writing directly on an unencrypted filesystem. Then you would be comparing EW(x) and W(x).\nOf course:\nEW(x) > W(x)\n\nBut you would save a double writing on the same filesystem which can't bring you performance or security.\n", "Q: Why does Intel Power Gadget fully freeze the system?

How does the Touch-Bar control an HTML5 video? When a video or other media plays a slider comes up with a slider that can control the timing of the video. How does the touchbar interact with an html5 video to change the time? Is it using javascript or what?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The touch bar controller does not interact as such directly with HTML5 and it is not using Javascript.\nIt is instead the other way around. It is the browser that asks the touch bar controller to do something (i.e. for example to display buttons for previous and next page, open tab, etc.). This is done through the NSTouchBar class provided by Apple in AppKit.\nThe touch bar hardware in itself does not for example know that a button means to open a new tab in Firefox. Instead the application (for example Firefox) is told via NSTouchBar that the button has been pressed, and the application (Firefox in this example) must implement that functionality itself.\nTherefore it is the browser that implements the action and thus controls the video – not the TouchBar.\n", "Q: Clarification on upgrading the OS and using OWC SSD?

This time I was able to easily find and download the ibooks app.\nNote: The answer just before this (from grgarside) worked for my spousal unit who already had Apple Pay fully set up.\n\nA: Open this link on your iOS device, then install the app.\n iBooks by Apple on the App Store\nWhen searching for built in apps on the App Store, ‘make sure that you use the exact name of the app’ per the Apple KB article Remove built-in Apple apps from the Home screen on your iOS 10 device or Apple Watch. The exact name is ‘iBooks’ so search for this word on the App Store and you should find the app. The first item may be an ad, but the first result below any ad should be the right app.\n", "Q: Multiple \"copies\" of audiobooks in iTunes I am using iTunes on Windows 10.\nThere are multiple \"copies\" (air quotes) of most (not all) audiobooks in iTunes. I used air quotes because when I search the PC for the books, there are only single instances.\nAnother post (Why does iTunes create multiple exact copies of my music files and hide them from view in Finder?) asked a similar question about music files. The answer for that post alluded to a playlist problem.\nBut (a) I do NOT have any playlists for my audiobooks, and (b) that post is old, dating to Sept. 2012. I am running version 12.7.2.\nWhen I select a copy of a book and drag it to my iphone, I can see that the copies are numbered 1, 2, 3, ...\nWhen I try to delete any one of those copies, then all copies are deleted.\nWhat can I do clean up the lists so that I only see one copy of the book?\n\nA: Through trial and error, found the source of the problem and a solution that consistently works for me. Explanation and screenshot follows.\nSource of the Problem\nThe Sorting tab has three groups you can sort on: title, chapter, author. If the text in the specific field is disabled, then there will be duplicate copies of a given audiobook.\nNote: The words \"disabled\" (for gray text) and \"enabled\" (for black text) in this context are my own and may or may not be the same terms used by Apple devos.\nSolution\nSimply retype the disabled (gray) text.\nThe screenshot shows an example where the \"chapter\" field was disabled. When I retyped \"Mixed,\" the text changed to black. Clicked OK, and the duplicate audiobooks disappeared.\nThe same solution worked for me when title or author were disabled. Note that the \"sort as\" field is ok in gray.\n\n\nA: This works like a charm. \n\n\n*\n\n*switch to grid view in View > View as\n\n*Select all chapters of the offending book\n\n*follow solution above\n\n", "Q: Where to find files like pictures and music from Mac hard drive? So my father has a Mac that doesn't boot so I'm copying files from the hard drive to a USB. I am not a Mac user and am having difficulties finding where all the files like pictures and music would be stored. I would appreciate if people explained where I can find his desktop, music, and such. I am accessing the Terminal from the recovery section.\n\nA: If the defaults are in play, then the path to the Users folder of the Macintosh HD when booted from the Recovery HD is:\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users\n\n\n*\n\n*Update Note: At the time this was originally posted it was accurate as stated, however, since macOS Catalina the actual physical location is '/Volumes/Macintosh HD - Data/Users'. That said, either path can be used to retrieve user files from.\nWithin that, the Users directory at the above path, there will be Shared directory and at least one other, which would be your fathers.\nIt is within that directory you'll find:\nDesktop\nDocuments\nDownloads\nMovies\nMusic\nPictures\n\nEtc.\n\nIf you are doing this from macOS Recovery, I would probably opt to make a Disk Image of the target Users folder using Disk Utility > File > New > Disk Image from Folder.\nThen at least you could do it using a GUI and it would retain all the meta-data too.\nNote however, if you have removed the HDD/SSD and have it in an external enclosure connected to another computer, then the path to the Users folder is just /Users, meaning in the root of the volume.\n", "Q: Is Apple signaling the intention to phase out MacOS? In the recent Apple what's a computer ad for iPad there is a clear hint that a computer is no longer something that 'young cool kids' care about.\nAre there any known unambiguous indicators that a convergence of MacOS and iOS is planned? \nMy understanding is that currently Apple has no dedicated MacOS dev team, only an iOS team which backports iOS features to MacOS. MacOS seems to be dragging behind iOS as a lower priority, less profitable 'image' project.\nI understand it is currently a speculative topic, but are there any publicly available statements or recorded evidence about what's on the books? Are we going to see a sexed up iPad that will eventually replace the MacBooks (including Pro) or a unified cross-platform AppleOS that will run on Macs, iPhones, and iPads?\n\nA: Mark Gurman (Bloomberg) says that iOS and macOS apps will merge soon but previously Apple has been against merging the actual operating systems.\n\nStarting as early as next year, software developers will be able to design a single application that works with a touchscreen or mouse and trackpad depending on whether it’s running on the iPhone and iPad operating system or on Mac hardware, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nThe iPad Pro has been recommended by Apple for casual users (web browsing etc), saying that a Mac is overkill for them. Obviously professionals will still need full blown Macs for complex software applications but likely we’ll start seeing decent Text Editors etc. arrive on the iPad.\n—\nUPDATE: relevant blog post (Daring Fireball) criticizing the Bloomberg article’s focus:\n\nMark Gurman had an intriguing story at Bloomberg this week, but the problems start with the headline itself: “Apple Plans Combined iPhone, iPad and Mac Apps to Create One User Experience”.\nGurman probably didn’t write the headline, but it doesn’t even make sense. iOS has no concept of a mouse cursor and runs only on touchscreen devices. MacOS has no support for touchscreen devices and requires a mouse pointer. “One user experience” is neither possible nor desirable. The truth is that this effort by Apple is almost certainly not about cross-platform applications but instead cross-platform frameworks for developers. It’s developer news, not user news.\n\n", "Q: Install High Sierra using Screen Sharing I have a headless Mac mini that currently runs macOS Sierra. I typically control this machine using Screen Sharing, which works fine even when rebooting a machine.\nI'd like to upgrade the machine to macOS High Sierra, but am not sure if a complete OS install will work using Screen Sharing. Perhaps it will disable Screen Sharing for security reasons upon install, perhaps there are dialog boxes which have to be answered before Screen Sharing is enabled, etc. \nDoes anyone have experience doing this?\n\nA: I've tested this by screen sharing a VM and it seems to work great!\nUsing macOS screen sharing app, connect as an administrator and be the only user logged in to the machine at the moment. If, on connecting, you get a message that another user is logged in and whether you want to share session or create a new session, cancel and log in as the correct user. The update will proceed correctly regardless of whether you do this, however you won't be able to see the progress of the update, as other sessions are disconnected immediately.\nI'm not aware of any macOS update which has ever required input outside a user account. The setup assistant (‘Sign in to iCloud’, etc) happens after you log in to your user account again, which is usual screen sharing.\nUpon starting the update, the user is logged out but the progress bar is still a standard macOS application. Screen sharing continues to work fine at this point.\nOnce the ‘progress bar’ stage of the installation is complete, the machine reboots, and screen sharing is disconnected. macOS screen sharing app shows ‘reconnecting’ and eventually the connection is resumed. If your Mac takes a while to reboot, screen sharing may time out, so wait a while and manually reconnect.\nIf you have Little Snitch installed, it should be fine, but might also be worth choosing ‘Silent Mode — Allow Connections’ just in case for the duration of the update.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Display Daisy Chain Mini Displayport Monitor I have an issue that I can't seem to be able to fix.

You cannot attach (daisy chain) another monitor off of the Thunderbolt port on a Thunderbolt display. It's a limitation of the monitor, not the MBA\nFrom AppleInsider:  Apple clarifies Thunderbolt Display will not daisy chain Cinema Display\n\nHowever, users with an existing Mini DisplayPort external monitor will\n  not be able to daisy chain the screen from the back of the new\n  Thunderbolt Display, despite it being physically compatible with the\n  port.

Just click this link and then \"Add to iCloud Drive\"\n\n\n\n*Open GarageBand application in your phone, click the import button and look for the ringtone file in the iCloud folder, don't open it, just long press it and then click on the share option.\n\n\n\n*Select the ringtone option and then click Export in the top right corner. Finally when exported, click the option \"Use sound as...\" and then \"Standard Ringtone\". Done!\n\n\n*Now you can delete GarageBand application if you want, it takes a lot of space (1.77 GB).\nNotes:\nIf you want to make any modification to the fade effect you will need to open this folder in a Mac with GarageBand, change the Master Track, and then go to Share > Project to GarageBand for iOS.\nYou can inspire in that file to make any ringtone increment the volume gradually.\nUpdate\nUpdated links:\nOpening (Gradual)\nOpening (Gradual) for Mac\nPD: I don't own an iPhone anymore and don't know if this method still works\n", "Q: Can't set Live Photo as wallpaper, only Still and Perspective options When I want to set a Live Photo as my wallpaper it only had Still and Perspective as options.

Is there any way this can be fixed and any reason this may occur? I really do not want to replace this machine as it was a Christmas gift as my family knows I collect these older machines.\n\nA: I doubt it's the gun that's the issue, but without getting actual hands-on, it's impossible to tell for sure.\nIt could be something as simple as color being out of sync and a simple degauss should correct.  Pass a magnet across the front of the screen; that should clear things up.  You don't need anything powerful.  I've used re-purposed speaker magnets back in the day.  I have also seen people use tool magnetizers with the added benefit that if it doesn't work, you still have a functional tool for future magnetizing needs (from $2 to $10 USD).\nIf the degauss fails, it may be a component or a faulty solder joint that controls the color hue/saturation.  At this point, it would be best to take it to a pro who specializes in this type of diagnostic/repair.    It's not a difficult repair and shouldn't be costly at all.  It's just that you will be working with extremely high voltages and can be quite dangerous for the novice.\n", "Q: Keynote record slideshow with external mic I've looked for hours on how to record a slideshow with an external USB microphone but I didn't find anything. \nIs it possible to change the audio input in Keynote to an external mic?\n\nA: Keynote uses the system sound input device, set in System Preferences → Sound → Input. Choose your preferred connected input device from this list, then start the recording in Keynote.\n\n", "Q: How can I automatically eject volumes I no longer use? I have a volume (saved as an encrypted sparsebundle) that I use from time to time.  For security reasons it should be ejected when not in use.  Of course I should do it myself, and usually I remember.  But not always.  Is there an automated way to do this as a back-up for fallible me?\nMaybe a Folder Action attached to it that will eject it after a certain length of time (or even better, a certain length of time idle) or at a certain time of day?\nMaybe a way to have it automatically ejected when the computer sleeps?  Currently, it is still there after computer sleep.  (I don't want to use logout because there are other processes I want to keep going.)\n\nA: Thanks to patrix, I now have it working.  I will post something here for others who want to do this in the future.\nIt seems that cronjob is no longer recommended, instead launchd.

You can disable this in Preferences->General\n\nPictures which are not kept within the library itself won't be available in iCloud though (which may or may not be a problem for you).\nIf you want to use iCloud (e.g. for sharing of pictures between iPhone and Mac) you can keep the option selected and import the pictures into the library in batches. You could then also decide to keep the originals in the iCloud library only, and just have Photos automatically download hires pictures on demand.

Not only couldn't the card be formatted, but files couldn't be added or deleted nor anything else that required writing to the card. (Reading files was unaffected.) It was effectively in read-only mode like a full-size SD card with the switch flipped, but obviously the micro SD doesn't have that. Only solution is replacement.\nI know this is an old post, but I thought I'd add the real cause (i.e. a defective card, not a software or format issue)  for future reference.\n\nA: FAT32 cannot format partitions bigger than 32GB. You will have to use a different partition scheme that is compatible with whatever device this SD card will go into, like exFAT.\n", "Q: Cause of this kernel panic IOVideoPocketCamDevice::terminate When I started my iMac 27-inch, it shows the message \"your computer has been restarted because of an error\".\nI searched on the internet and Apple's site said that it might be a software issue so I reinstalled macOS, but even after that the same error is showing after boot up within ~20seconds\nCould anyone help by reading the following log report, whether it's software or hardware issue? and which apps should I delete in safe mode?

It's 5-7% louder than the 2015 version but its mid and high ranges are less detailed (not pleasant to hear comparing to the 2015, even w/o comparing it's obvious that something is missing, the low end on the contrary is too loud and bulky that ruins the whole balance. Also it tends to overload the sound volume so it can give you a harsh/cracking sound, so I'm disappointed in this regard.\nAs for the 2018 version (12.9), again it sounds like from the closed barrel, does  not have enough mid and high range, the low range became even more punchier than the 2017 one, not pleasant. It's very loud but not balanced at all. the 11 inch version has a better balanced sound than the 12.9 version although it's not that loud.\nFor example if you record a voice (thru ext Cardioid Condenser Mic and listen it on 2015 version it sounds almost identical to the original) but both latter versions lack of high and upper mid ranges, so your voice sounds like it was recorded with some foam rubber placed between your mouth and the mic.\nAnother example in Garage Band you need to add about 15% to treble in order to get similar sound in upper range.\n\nA: The new iPad Pro has 4 speakers while older models have only 2.\n", "Q: How do I find the sha256 hash of text on a Mac?

I don't want to have to deal with any performance issues while coding and compiling or render images/graphics in Adobe CC.\nI'm very new to the whole Mac ecosystem, so all advice is appreciated.\n\nA: \nDoes connecting a monitor to MacBook Pro via display adapter lower the\n  refresh rate,\n\nNot necessarily.  It will only do so if you get an adapter/cable that doesn't conform to the latest specifications (i.e. it doesn't support 4K at 60Hz)\nThe best place to find what the MacBook Pro will support with respect to an external display is directly from Apple:\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display\n  at millions of colors and:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*One display with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n  \n*Up to two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at millions of colors\n  \n*Up to two displays with 3840-by-2160 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n  \n\nAs for what monitor to get, the best advice is to get one that a) works with you and your workflow and b) has a DisplayPort/mini DisplayPort interface.  This way, you don't have to convert from the DisplayPort signal that is natively on your MacBook Pro.  All you will need is a USB-C to DisplayPort cable to connect\n\nA: One comment - IIRC, that macbook only has 2 TB3 ports, so you'll need something that also allows for charging while connecting to 2 external monitors... for example, something like this - https://www.amazon.com/Paheven-Display-JellyFish-Mini-DisplayPort-Charging/dp/B079CBNK8M/\n", "Q: Is there any way to rotate a magic trackpad? I want to use my magic trackpad while it's rotated, as if in 'portrait' mode.\nI can't find any option to make it work like this, unlike a display Rotation option.\nIs there a way for me to use it this way? If so, how?\n\nA: You have three options that I'm aware of, but depending on the version of macOS you're running, probably only one of them is a real chance of doing exactly what you want.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Terminal commands to rotate the trackpad orientation. However, the commands I'm aware of only work to rotate it 180° instead of 90°. It also doesn't work for macOS Sierra or macOS High Sierra. If you're running an earlier version of macOS and rotating 180° is an option for you, then see details below for Terminal commands.\n\n*Try using MagicPrefs, however this is now on its last legs as an option. It's worked brilliantly for many users for a long time, but for various reasons is no longer maintained\n\n*Try using BetterTouchTool. This is probably your best bet. You can install it for free for 45 days to test how well it meets your needs.\n\n\nTerminal commands\nIf you decide that rotating your trackpad 180° will meet your needs, and assuming you're running an older version of macOS, then follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (usually found in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Enter the following command (or copy and paste it):\nsudo sudo defaults write com.apple.MultitouchSupport ForceAutoOrientation YES\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Enter the following command (or copy and paste it):\nsudo defaults write com.apple.trackpad.orientation TrackpadOrientationMode 1\n\n*Press Enter\nOnce you've entered both commands you should be able to just turn Bluetooth off and then on again to activate the change in orientation.\n", "Q: Is my iPhone 7 that was bought in Japan compatible with Verizon neywork and H2O wireless network? I would like to know if my new phone, iPhone 7 (A1779) from Japan works on Verizon and H2O wireless network.

The A1660 (which supports both GSM and CDMA) is identical in terms of cellular capabilities. This is the phone you'd get under a Verizon contract, or if you just buy one without a contract. The A1779 differs only in that it includes contactless NFC for use in Japan.\nAll models of the iPhone 7 support GSM, so H20 is no problem.\n", "Q: kextload: command not found Strange, I have access to other kext utilities such as kextcache, kextfind, kextlibs, kextstat, kextunload, kextutil but not kextload.

I tried Ubuntu 16.04 and Linux Mint 18.03. \nDid anyone succeeded to boot Linux OS from a machine similar to mine? How can I create workable Linux (preferably Ubuntu) live USB on my MacBook?  \n\nA: Ubuntu does not natively support MacBook Pro Mid-2017 yet, so you have to manually install some drivers and patches to get it fully working. During the process, you will need a usb mouse. Also if you don’t have a usb keyboard, you can use on-screen keyboard (which is what I did). Then you have to follow this tutorial: Linux on MacBook Pro Late 2016 and later \n\nA: Yes you can. Just use a USB mouse and go over to the Bluetooth section under Ubuntu and you will see the mouse appear. You just have to connect it and turn the keyboard on and off via the switch and then press enter several times and you'll see that Bluetooth will find it again. You can then click and connect to it.\n\nA: A possible solution to help is to disable the ACPI option (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html) by adding acpi=off to the kernel boot options.\nTouchpad would work after that but since ACPI is used for hardware acceleration you will probably experience some higher CPU usage.\n", "Q: Is it ok to view Time Machine backup directly and store files inside backup.backupd?

Would just viewing the files affect my Time Machine backup and storing files inside backup.backupd? Because I just created a empty folder inside backup.backupd and I immediately deleted it.\n\nA: It's perfectly reasonable to manually navigate your Time Machine backup with Finder, even though you would usually use the Time Machine app instead of Finder. Whilst it's not something to rely on, Finder will prevent you from making changes to a Time Machine backup.\nI'd avoid storing your own files in Backups.backupd — put your own files outside this folder, there's no need to put your own files within the backups directory.\n", "Q: Cannot copy a large file; space available Trying to copy (drag and drop) an ISO file from SSD1/MacOS Extended to SSD2/FAT32 (two physically different and internal SATA drives):\n\n\n*\n\n*ISO file size: 4.7 GB\n\n*Space available on SSD2 partition: 20 GB\n\n\nError message: \n\n\"The item \"*.iso\" can't be copied because it is too large for the\n  volume's format\"\n\nTried to copy on a USB memory stick (10 GB available): same message.\nFrom the command line:\ncp /Users/me/file.iso /Volumes/Untitled/  \ncp: /Volumes/Untitled/file.iso: File too large\n\nCopying on the USB stick, same error but after trying for ten minutes (i.e. it thought the space was available, but it was not).\nEverything works when coping a smaller file (40 MB).\nWhat is wrong?

The diskutil command, shown below, shrinks the APFS container by 300 MB and creates the new 200 MB \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" volume labeled \"MacSSD via rEFInd\". \nsudo diskutil ap resizeContainer disk1 119500M JHFS+ \"MacSSD via rEFInd\" 200M\n\nAfter the command completes, restart the Mac.\n\n*Download the rEFInd Boot Manager software from this SourceForge web site. Enter the following commands to install the software to the \"MacSSD via rEFInd\" volume.\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.11.2\n./refind-install --ownhfs /dev/disk0s3\n\n\nNote: The error message Could not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc was expected and can be ignored.\n\n\n*Configure the TextEdit application. Open TextEdit, then navigate to the \"Preferences...\" window. Uncheck all the \"Options\", as shown below. When finished, quit TextEdit.\n\n\n*Use the command below to navigate to the folder containing the refind.conf file. \ncd \"/Volumes/MacSSD via rEFInd/System/Library/CoreServices\"\n\nMake a backup copy of this file.\ncp refind.conf refind.conf.orignal\n\nOpen the file in the TextEdit application.\nopen -e refind.conf\n\n\n*Add the following lines to the end of the refind.conf file. You should be able to just cut and paste these lines. When finished, save the changes, then quit TextEdit.\n#\n# Added to make rEFInd silent. \n#\nmenuentry \"MacSSD via rEFInd\" {\n    icon \\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\icons\\os_mac.png\n    volume \"MacSSD\"\n    loader \\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi\n    ostype MacOS\n    graphics on\n}\ntimeout -1\nhideui all\nscanfor manual\n\n\n*Enter the following commands to modify the /etc/fstab file. This entry will instruct macOS not to mount the volume labeled \"MacSSD via rEFInd\" at startup.\nsudo bash \necho >>/etc/fstab\necho \"LABEL=MacSSD\\040via\\040rEFInd none hfs rw,noauto\" >>/etc/fstab    \nexit\n\n\nNote: The character sequence \\040 is just the octal representation of the space character.\n\nWhen finished, restart the Mac.\nNow when choosing Boot Camp from the Control Panel, you should get something similar to what is shown below.\n\n", "Q: OneDrive on mac doesn show all shared folders with me On the website my account looks like this. There are 2 people sharing with me some files:\n\nbut after I have installed one drive on mac, I can see the following files:\n\nA whole frolder from the second user is missing, and the second file (tereny.xlsm) from the first user is missed. Why?\nOn the website and on onedrive on mac, I am logged in as the same outlook account.\n\nA: Only folders you have ‘can edit’ permission show in OneDrive desktop client.\nYou only have ‘can view’ permission to the missing folder, so that's why it's not shown.\nAdd and sync shared folders to OneDrive\n\nA: If you still have issues seeing shared folders that you can edit, try adding them as shortcuts to the Files folder: you go to the Shared folder on the OneDrive web page and select one of the shared folders there, click the folder menu and choose \"Create shortcut\".\n(Sorry, no screen shots, but my interface is in Swedish anyway...)\n", "Q: Delete a standard user from Mac OS I created a new Admin account in Sierra High and needed to delete the previous admin account which is marked now as the standard user. However, after unlocking as admin and selecting the respective user that I would like to delete, I see the - sign is marked as Grey. \n\nThis is all accounts and I would like to delete the mac user account, \n$ dscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'\nname: mac\npassword: ********\nuid: 501\ngid: 20\ndir: /Users/mac\nshell: /bin/bash\n--\n--\nname: chaklader\npassword: ********\nuid: 502\ngid: 20\ndir: /Users/chaklader\nshell: /bin/bash\n\nHow do I delete the respective account? I find a code snippet to run on the terminal, i.e, sudo /usr/bin/dscl . -delete \"/Users/mac\". Should I try that and will work out?\nUpdate:\nAs an answer suggested, I'm not logged in to the the fast user switching menu.\n\nAs it was asked, I run who in the terminal and get the result, \n$ who\n\nchaklader console  Dec 28 06:01 \nchaklader ttys000  Dec 28 14:51\n\nSo, in brief the other user, mac was not in the terminal. \n\nA: I had a very similar problem to this.  With the help of Apple Support I solved it.  I posted the solution here:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/33849669\nRepeating that here, it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the recovery partition. \n\n*Choose Terminal from the Utilities menu --> Terminal should appear. \n\n*Enter:  resetpassword at the prompt and hit return --> a new window/app should appear behind the Terminal window called \"Reset Password\" \n\n*Go through the steps to reset the password for the account you're trying to delete.\n\n*Restart the Mac and log back in as your main admin account. \n\n*Go to Users & Groups System Preferences pane, select the account you're trying to delete and hit the minus button.\n\n\nFixed it for me.  Hope this helps!\n\nA: The – button is greyed out for a user when the user is still logged in with Fast User Switching. Log out the other user you're trying to delete, then return to System Preferences with this user account and try again. You can restart to be sure that user is inactive as well. \nYou can delete a user from command line and you need to be careful you have the exact short name correct or you will erase the wrong data. In this case, the short name is mac. Run the following to delete the user and separately delete the user's home folder. If you want to keep the home folder, don't run the rm command.\nsudo dscl . delete /Users/mac\nsudo rm -rf /Users/mac\n\nIf the dscl command fails, reset the password on the account and retry the above commands.\nsudo passwd mac\n\n\nA: Both of the above answers are great places to start but I found that those methods may not always work. In the case that the above answers fail, you can try the following :\n\n*\n\n*First, go to Directory Utility and enable the root user by clicking Edit > Enable Root User or as mentioned by @nohillslide, you can do sudo -s instead of su -l.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following (enter the password for root when prompted):\nsu -l\ncd /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users\nrm username.plist\nrm -rf /Users/username\nreboot\n\nMAKE SURE YOU DISABLE ROOT AFTER YOU FINISH!! (You simply have to go to Directory Utility > Edit > Disable Root User)\nThe above commands will simply login as root, delete the property list file for the user, and clear the home directory.\n\nA: Follow the command to Delete a User Account:\nsudo /usr/bin/dscl . -delete /Users/<USER_ACCOUNT>\n\n", "Q: Do we need to disable the trim on an 3rd party SSD before updating a Mac? I have a MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 and I installed an SSD in it. I'd like to upgrade my computer, but I'm not sure if I need to disable the trim before the update and reenable it after. I've heard that it could cause problems, but don't know why. \nI have macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and I've enabled the trim since I switched to this operating system.\n\nA: TRIM is a subset of the ATA commands specific to SSDs.  \nCan you operate without it?  Sure, but it will treat your SSD as if it were a spinning HDD - impacting performance and lifespan.\nFrom Wikipedia:  \n\nThe TRIM command enables an operating system to notify the SSD of\n  pages which no longer contain valid data. For a file deletion\n  operation, the operating system will mark the files sectors as free\n  for new data, then send a TRIM command to the SSD. After trimming, the\n  SSD will not preserve any contents of the block when writing new data\n  to a page of flash memory, resulting in less write amplification\n  (fewer writes), higher write throughput (no need for a\n  read-erase-modify sequence), thus increasing drive life.\n\nIf your MacBook Pro came with an SSD, it's enabled by default.  If not, you must enable TRIM when you upgrade to an SSD.\n", "Q: How can I stop iPhone prompting me to setup Apple Pay in Settings? Since upgrading iOS to 11.2.1, my iPhone has aggressively prompted me to setup Apple Pay. Every time I decline to set it up.\nNow, there is this persistent badge (\"1\") on my Settings app, which makes me think there is some kind of iOS update to install, but instead, it is a prompt to setup Apple Pay (\"Finish Setting Up Your iPhone\"):\n\nHow can I turn off prompts/notifications/badges asking me to setup Apple Pay?\nThis is not the same as disabling Apple Wallet notifications, as asked and answered at Disable Apple Pay/Wallet spam. Disabling Apple Wallet notifications does not disable the Apple Pay spam (specifically, the Settings badge icon). This question is different as it is about Apple Pay and the Settings badge icon (not notifications specifically), and the solution in the purported \"duplicate\" question does not solve this problem.\n\nA: It is because of Apple Pay Cash.  When the feature is enabled, you need a valid card in order to use Messages (since that’s the vehicle for Apple Pay Cash).  If you go to the Wallet settings, it will say this pretty explicitly.  When you turn off Apple Pay Cash from that screen, the nag immediately disappears.\n\nAt least it did for me.   I had previously already clicked the “set up later” link in Apple Pay setup.  I don’t know if that was necessary or not.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Settings app → Wallet and Apple Pay.\n\n*Turn off Apple Cash.\n\n*Go back to Settings app main screen and go to the notification about setting up Apple Pay. Click as if you’re going to set it up, and then click on set up later.\n\n*You then have to go back into \"Wallet and Apple Pay\" and again turn Apple Cash back off as it was turned back on.\n\nA: Choose the option to finish setting up your iPhone, then choose Set Up Apple Pay. On the following screen, under Continue, choose Set Up Later in Wallet.\nIf you are in a region where Apple Pay Cash is supported, go to Wallet & Apple Pay in Settings, then disable Apple Pay Cash.\n\nA: I got round it by adding a card I never use and not verifying the card.  Not ideal but it works\n", "Q: Start a video at a specific time using terminal I want to be able to start a video, 30 seconds in, using the terminal.

I plan to purchase iPhone SE. The spec says the Wi-Fi module is 802.11ac (5 GHz band). However, my router is rather old - it supports 802.11b and 802.11g only (2.4 GHz band).\nI cannot find information on whether a 802.11ac device can work in a backward compatible mode (i.e., on a lower frequency) with a 802.11b/g router or not.\nSo, will I be able to connect iPhone SE to a 802.11b/g router?\n\nA: Absolutely.\nAlmost all wifi products are backwards compatible (I can't think of any that aren't). Specifically regarding the iPhone SE, the site GSM Arena lists the full specs for the iPhone SE's wifi modem: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, hotspot.\n", "Q: Storage, what percentage to leave free? Flash memory and SSD controllers are reported to spend more time running wear-leveling and/or anti-fragmentation garbage collection algorithms when their storage is near full.  \nPeople have reported that clearing some free space on their near full SSD storage, and leaving their iMac or MacBook running overnight (to do something like wear-leveling or storage block garbage collection) increased storage speed/bandwidth performance significantly.  Similar things are reported to occur involving UI lag on iOS devices that have almost completely full flash storage.\nSo, is there a recommended percentage of free space to leave on the SSD on a Mac, or the flash storage on an iOS device, to avoid having these algorithms kick in and possibly affect storage speed or read/write performance.\n\nA: I read that things slow down when it is less than 20% free on a SSD or HDD on a Mac. I noticed my read/write speed seemed to improve when I freed up some space to get near the 20%.  I don't know about IOS devices but 20% seems reasonable there as well.\n\nA: macOS will tell you how much space it thinks it needs on your startup disk partition. Run\ndiskutil resizevolume disk0s2 limits |\\\nperl -0777 -ne '@r=m/\\b(\\d+\\.\\d) GB/g;print sprintf(\"%.1f GB\\n\",@r[2]-@r[1]);'\n\nwhere disk0s2 is the identifier of your startup disk. This returns how much space macOS requires on your disk. Testing on a couple of Macs myself, I get 4.3 GB, 5.4 GB and 10.7 GB.\nThe perl command calculates the difference between the following values output by diskutil limits: ‘Minimum size (constrained by file usage)’ and ‘Recommended minimum size (if used for OS)’.\n", "Q: iOS 11: How do I replace the emoji keyboard button with a punctuation menu without third-party tools? I have no idea how anyone types quickly on the default iOS 11 keyboard considering you have to bring up a full different keyboard to type punctuation. My previous phone was a Google Nexus 4 and the default keyboard there had a punctuation button which you can hold down for a dropdown menu to select common punctuation marks.\nI can't figure out why the devs thought it was a good idea to prioritize emojis over punctuation. How do I fix this without downloading a third-party keyboard or tool?\n\nA: *\n\n*Slide your finger from the punctuation button in the bottom left of the keyboard, to the punctuation mark you want, then release. This automatically switches the keyboard back after typing the punctuation you chose.\n\n*Hold the punctuation button whilst tapping a punctuation key with another finger. Releasing your finger from the punctuation button returns the keyboard to the standard keyboard.\n\n\nBoth of these techniques are much faster than separately tapping the punctuation button, entering punctuation, then tapping again to return to the standard keyboard.\nIt's not possible to modify the standard iOS keyboard more than the settings available in Settings → General → Keyboard, which does not offer any way to change the language input menu. If necessary, you can replace the iOS keyboard with any third-party keyboard from the App Store.\n", "Q: Triple Booting Mac, Windows, and Linux—A boot load nightmare A few months ago I installed Ubuntu on my mac; I was dual booting. I did so following this tutorial. In this guide, I was instructed to install rEFInd; I did. Everything was good for those few months until now. The install was successful and my boot loader we rEFInd.\nA few days ago, I decided that I needed to install Windows (I was itching to play some good ole' AoE 2!). I did this using boot camp.\nAfter Windows was done doing its thing and the boot camp Windows add-ons were installed, I tried to switch back to the macOS side of the machine. I restarted the machine, held down option (entered in my firmware password), and expected to see the rEFInd boot loader (mistakenly, of course). Instead, I saw the macOS boot loader, only the only bootable device was windows. Yep, macOS and Linux were both unable to be seen from the boot loader after holding down the option key when restarting the machine; the only bootable device was Windows.\nI booted up into macOS from a recovery USB that I had handy. When I did so and I opened up disk utility. The disk utility program from the live USB could see the three partition that I had—one for macOS, one for Windows, and one for Linux. The sizes of each of the partitions were correct, however something odd was going on. The Windows partition was recognized as a Bootcamp Windows partition. The Linux partition was only recognized as a Linux filesystem. The macOS partition was not recognized as a valid partition at all. It was blank space, in the eyes of this live USB disk utility program.\nNext, I booted into recovery mode on the native machine (letting the machine download the internet recovery mode device). Here, the disk utility program only recognized the Bootcamp partition as the only valid partition. Both the Linux and macOS partitions were unmountable, both from disk utility and from the terminal.\nAt this point, I called Apple Support and their only advice was to wipe the entire disk and reinstall all three operating systems.\nWell, I didn't do that. I reinstalled macOS because I keep a backup copy of all of my data so this wasn't a big deal to me.\nNow, on this fresh install of macOS (the most recent version, 10.13.2). Disk utility recognizes Windows and macOS, but it won't recognize the Linux partition, even as a Linux filesystem. I can still see the partition that I made for it a few months ago, but it appears that I would have to delete and reinstall Linux to boot into it again. I don't keep a backup of that, unfortunately, because I only do tiny projects on there. There is currently one tiny project that I actually care about that I would rather not lose.\nFurther, rEFInd will not boot up when I restart and press the option key. Yes, I have disabled SIP and installed it from macOS. Yes, I have installed it from a USB while in recovery mode. \nMy two questions:\n1. How do I make rEFInd be the default bootloader. When you answer this, please understand that I have already followed the instructions form the rEFInd webiste found here.\n2. If number 1 cannot happen, how can I get disk utility to recognize the Linux partition (which it did before I tried to install Windows with boot camp by the way)?\nEDIT: Responding to more information\nModel/Year: Late 2013 Macbook Pro\nWindows Version: Windows 10 Education edition\n$ diskutil list \n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         350.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                100.1 GB   disk0s3\n   4:           Linux Filesystem                         50.0 GB    disk0s4\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +350.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume macOS                   85.2 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 20.3 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                506.6 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *62.0 GB    disk2\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Traveldrive             61.8 GB    disk2s3\n\n$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  683595736      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  684005376  195442688      3  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n  879448064        704         \n  879448768   97656256      4  GPT part - 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4\n  977105024          3         \n  977105027         32         Sec GPT table\n  977105059          1         Sec GPT header\n\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60821/255/63 [977105060 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  977105059] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused  \n\n\nA: As for your first question:\nAs you probably have already read from the rEFInd web site, the commands. to make rEFInd appear at startup are given below. You would have to enter these commands after booting to the macOS 10.13.2 recovery partition. You could enter the commands while booted to macOS 10.13.2, but you first would have to disable System Integrity Protection.\ndiskutil  mount  disk0s1\nsudo  bless  --mount  /Volumes/EFI  --setBoot  --file  /Volumes/EFI/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi  --shortform\ndiskutil  unmount  disk0s1\n\nIf the above does not work, then rEFInd is not installed as you described in your question.\nAs for your second question:\nI an not sure why you are worried if the disk utility can recognize your linux partition. Unless you have installed some third party software, macOS can not read linux formatted partitions. Your question gives no indication that you have install such software. Anyway, the output from the diskutil list command shows that the linux partition is being correctly recognized.\nIf the files on the linux partition are important, then I would think the first priority would be to remove the files from the internal disk. This could be done by creating a a Ubuntu bootable flash drive and boot to a Live version of Ubuntu. If you can access your files, then I would copy the files to a second backup flash drive or other external drive.\nJust to let you know:\nIf you do decide to start over, I would suggest installing the operating systems in the following order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install macOS\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows.\n\n*Install Ubuntu using the instructions given here.\n\n*(Optional) Install rEFInd.\n\n", "Q: External drive with OS X 10.13.2 will not boot from USB 3.0 enclosure I'm cutting and pasting from Apple's Community support site where I posted this issue today, rather than type it again, since the details are dense:\nMy system, prior to 12/20/2017 was a MacBookPro9.2 (mid 2012) running 10.8.5. Why that OS? I hate Apple upgrades, as things always break and 3rd party SW has to be upgraded. Mountain Lion is a perfectly good OS, but over time has not been able to keep up with iOS. I loath the Apple phone so 10.8.5 suited me just fine, until I needed some R bits complied for Sierra. So, R is very important to me so I upgraded to 10.13.2 from the Apple store. I upgraded to an SSD inside the Mac, and after 5 days of testing, used Carbon Copy Cloner 5.0.5 to clone the SSD to an HFS+ (recommended by CCC) HDD inside an OWC/Mac.Sales On-The-Go USB 3.0 enclosure. No issues and CCC even created a 10.13.2 Recovery image. Interestingly, the Apple store upgrade wiped the 10.8.2 Recovery image on the SSD, leaving me with no Recovery image on that drive.\nThe HDD inside that enclosure is not bootable, neither the standard image nor the Recovery image though it is readable. The boot-time progress bar goes about 60% of the way and then aborts to the circle with the diagonal line. Bummer! After several days of troubleshooting with a CCC support engineer, with zero success, I was left with no option other than to swap the SSD and the HDD to nail down whether it was the enclosure or CCC at fault. Now folks, get this, the HDD when inside the machine boots perfectly, both standard and Recovery images but when the SSD, which received the bits from the Apple store, is inside the OWC enclosure, it will not boot. Also interestingly, the problem is not bidirectional. CCC can write to a disk inside this enclosure and create a perfect OS image, but the error occurs at boot time when the bits are being read. Man, does that make me suspicious. Did Apple do this to harm competitive device makers or is 10.13.2 still flaky? I've reported the issue to OWC but have yet to hear back. \nSo, other than buying a new external enclosure guaranteed to work with High Sierra, is there any fix to make the OS boot from an external device? Has this issue been seen by others? Also, bummer twice over, I have a RAID backup device still at 10.8.5, bootable, to which I fear attempting a backup, since that image could also be made unbootable :-(\n\nA: Assuming I read your question correctly, on the face of it it seems the issue is with the enclosure since neither the HDD nor the SSD will boot when inside it.\nHowever, two things you could try (because they're simple and quick to do) are to reset both the NVRAM and SMC, in that order. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected (so, unplug your external enclosure) and make sure you use the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP. That's a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, test your Mac to see whether you can boot from the external enclosure.\n\nA: Test your RAM with memtester. Also if you upgraded your RAM with non Apple modules, if you still have the originals try to swap them back and see if the problems keep showing up.\n\nA: I have functionally the exact same problem. Dual-boot internal SSD with Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and High Sierra 10.13.6 in a 2012 MacBook Pro (non-Retina). Both systems and both Recovery HDs boot fine. All are cloned to external HD in a USB 3.0 case.\nExternal 10.8.5 and its Recovery HD boot fine. External 10.13.6 and its Recovery HD will not boot when chosen in Startup Disk control panel. On Restart, MBP bizarrely boots into external Recovery HD (10.8.5), not external 10.13.6.\nOn regular startup holding down Option key, external 10.13.6 and its Recovery HD do not even appear in list. All 6 other bootable partitions do.\nResetting NVRAM and SMC, as described above, had no affect on issue. I have exhausted all partition, directory, and file tests. External 10.13.6 is a perfect clone of functioning internal 10.13.6.\nThis is a serious bug and I need a resolution. My external HD is a 15mm height 4TB, so I cannot just open the MBP and swap the 4TB 7mm height SSD with it. The MBP will not accept a 2.5\" drive thicker than 9.5mm.\nCarbon Copy Cloner site lists 2012 MacBook Pros as being unable to access boot partitions beyond 2TB on an external drive.  This seems to be my case.  Did anyone ever find a solution?\n\nA: Created my own solution last night.\nRe-formatted external 4TB clean, then re-partitioned it with the first partition being 1.95TB and the second 2.05TB.  From there I repeated the cloning of my two internal 2TB partitions to them.  (Taking a cumulative 10 hours, that's no minor trial and error.)\nSince the boot blocks of both systems reside within the first 2TB of the drive, everything works just fine now.  As I made no other changes, the problem of a 2012 MacBook Pro not booting from an external hard drive where the system is beyond the first 2TB must be true.  I imagine that an unlimited number of partitions could boot the same way, as long as they do not begin beyond the 2TB mark.\nIn hindsight, I should have made the 2 partitions 1.98TB and 2.02TB, which would have the second partition begin 20GB into the first 2TB.  That's enough space for the whole default system folder.  Perhaps even 1.99TB and 2.01TB would work.\nThat said, the problem was clearly not the RAM, PRAM, SMC, or external enclosure.\n", "Q: On iPhone X can you see the most recent running apps? On iPhone 7 it is possible to double tap the Home button to see them. On iPhone X is there an equivalent?\n\nA: If you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hold for a moment, you will see the most recent applications. You can then swipe left and right to select.\n", "Q: Question about installing SSD into a Macbook Pro I want to upgrade the hard drive in my 2012 Macbook Pro to an SSD. I have the parts, but had a question about how to clone the contents of my current drive so I can install it onto the SSD.\nI've seen tutorials where people suggest connecting the new SSD to the Macbook prior to installation and using a Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the drive, and then installing the SSD drive.\nMy question is, can I do a Time Machine backup of my current hard drive on an external hard drive, install the SSD, and then use the Time Machine backup from the external to transfer it onto the newly installed SSD? Is this the same as using the clone program above?\n\nA: You can restore the backup onto the SSD so long as the SSD fits the entire contents of the backup[1].\nAccording to Apple's support pages, you do not need to use an Apple Time Capsule for backups:\n\nTime Machine is the built-in backup feature of your Mac. To use it, you need an external storage solution, sold separately:\n\n*\n\n*External hard drive connected to a USB, FireWire, or Thunderbolt port on your Mac\n\n*Time Capsule or macOS Server on your network\n\n*External hard drive connected to the USB port of an AirPort Extreme Base Station on your network\n\n\nThen you would want to restore using macOS recovery using the \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\" utility.\n[1]: It's possible this is not the same as the size used by your hard drive, as the Time Machine backup also has previous versions of files and deleted files. However, since you are newly setting up Time Machine, there would be no previous versions of files.\n\nA: \n...can I do a time machine backup of my current hard drive on an\n  external hard drive, install the SSD, and then use the time machine\n  backup from the external to transfer it onto the newly installed SSD?\n\nYes.  This is a valid and accepted backup/restore technique.  The advantage here is you don't need to worry about size differentials of the two drives (larger HDD than your SSD, for example).\n\nIs this the same as using the clone program above?\n\nNo.  \nI would avoid this method when migrating from a HDD to an SSD. \nWhy?\nCloning is exactly what it's name implies - an exact copy of your drive down to the block level meaning blocks of data which were marked as deleted on the HDD but not overwritten get cloned to the SSD.\nAnd herein lies the problem.  Spinning drives delete files by deleting the pointer to the data (like deleting your address from government records but leaving the structure in tact).  SSDs on the other hand goes in and marks the area as \"unused\" (not just deleting the address, but putting a note on the record that it's unused while sending a working to report back that the building doesn't exist).\nWhen you clone, you will be cloning orphaned data that wasn't marked as unused but will subsequently write to that block.  \n(IMO) I would use this opportunity to do a clean install of macOS and migrate my data/settings over with Migration Assistant.  It will take longer than a simple backup/restore, but you get the opportunity to start with a \"clean slate\" so to speak which will pay off in the future (you're not copying/restoring hidden issues you backed up)\n", "Q: Vibrate iPhone every second Is there an app I can use to vibrate my iPhone once every second continuously?\n\nA: Yes, there is a way. \nHere's how on the iPhone (with pictures):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Pro Metronome by EUMLab\n\n*Use the large scroll wheel in the center to set the tempo to 60 BPM.\n\n*Press the button in the bottom left labelled \"4/4\"\n\n\n*From there, subtract the \"beat\" option until you see \"1/4\"\n\n*Tap the top area of the screen to go back to the main page.\n\n\n*Tap the pink rectangle in the top left until it is grayed out. This will prevent the phone from making a noise.\n\n*Tap the settings icon in the top left.\n\n\n*Enable the \"Vibrate\" option.\n\n*Go back to the main screen by tapping the right side of the screen.\n\n\n*Press the play button! The phone should vibrate every second until you close the app or the battery dies.\n\n", "Q: View HDMI output from another device on a Mid-2015 MacBook Pro I'm looking for a setup that will allow me to view the video output from another device (1080p/60 over HDMI) on my MacBook, at full frame rate and with minimal latency. I assume this would take the form of a Thunderbolt dongle, but I don't know what to look for, or if such a thing even exists.\nI don't need to be able to capture or encode video, though being able to save frames would be a plus. I'd also like to be able to view the video output scaled to full-screen, and if there's the option of software filtering (e.g. sharpening / fancy upscaling), that would be a plus as well.\n\nA: You can use a device such as the Elgato HD60 S, which offers low-latency capture from a 1080p60 HDMI source, which you can view on your MacBook over a USB 3.0 connection. \nIt also allows you to save and stream the video if you want to do that as well.\nIt's available from for example Amazon at $179.95:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Game-Capture-HD60-technology/dp/B01DRWCOGA\n", "Q: How to quickly connect to AirPods in iOS 11? I have AirPods and I love them but I don’t love what a hassle it is to switch my phone to send audio output to the AirPods. I have my AirPods synced with multiple devices such as my Mac, so it doesn't know which one to connect to.\nWhat I do now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe up from the bottom edge to raise the control center. \n\n*Force press the wave icon in the top right of the audio playback control\n\n*Tap the audio out control button on the right to raise a list of output devices.\n\n*Select the AirPods from that list.\n\n\nThis is too hard. There must be a simpler way. Is there?\nFor instance, can I configure a single tap control center button to switch to airpods? Tell Siri to do it with a properly phrased command?\n\nA: Just because one device sleeps does not make the airpods sync with another device. In such a case nothing happens and you have to manually connect on the device of your choice. I also struggle with this. My devices are not equal and I do different things on my iPhone, iPad, Macbook and iMac.\nWhat would be perfect, as mentioned, is a Siri integration. But that would mean that the Airpods understand Siri, which they don't.\nThanks for the tip to go via the media control, far less hassle but not ideal.\n\nA: I came across your post while looking for a solution to the same problem.  In the meantime, it's possible to at least reduce your 4-step process to a 3-stepper, assuming you're starting from the home screen, although it does require keeping the settings app in your device's dock area:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force press the \"Settings\" app icon\n\n*Select \"Bluetooth\", conveniently located on the last (i.e., nearest) row of choices.\n\n*Select AirPods from the list of Bluetooth devices.\n\n\nA: AirPods automatically connect and enable themselves as the audio output when taken out of the case and placed in your ears.\nThe audio output is switched back to the phone when AirPods are placed back in the case. You should rarely need to manually set the output device.\nIf you do need to manually set the output, you can 3D Touch anywhere on the media control, not just the wave icon in the corner.\n", "Q: Is there a native QR Code reader on iPhone? I was given an iPhone for Christmas and want to know how I can scan QR codes? My Google searches all point to articles or reviews about apps you can install, but some of these don’t even exist anymore. Some of my Google searches took me here where’s there’s questions and answers about installing QR code apps, but these all seem dated to me.\nCan I do this natively? Or do I really need to install an app for this?\nI just want to be able to scan the QR code and have my iPhone automatically open the web page, play the video, or whatever it is the code is set up to do.\n\nA: You don’t actually specify whether your iPhone was brand new, or just new to you, but if you’re running iOS 11 you can just open the Camera app and point it at a QR code. It will automatically recognise it for what it is and present you with a notification you can tap on to complete the action. \nFor example, using your camera to scan a QR code will prompt you to open a website, make a phone call, add a contact, launch a video, make a payment, etc.\nBelow are some screenshots showing examples of the prompts you can get:\n\n\n\nBy tapping the prompt iOS will open the appropriate app and perform the related action.\nNOTE: If the iPhone you got for Christmas is not a new iPhone and it's running an older version of iOS, then you’ll need to install a QR reader app (of which there are many) or, if the iPhone supports it, you can upgrade to iOS 11.\n\nA: A QR code reader is built into the camera app. Open Camera, point at a QR code and tap the notification shown at the top. There's no need to take a photo with the camera.\nIf it's not working, make sure it's enabled in Settings → Camera → Scan QR Codes:\n                                          \n", "Q: Can I disable automatic \"copy/look up/share\" on my iPhone SE? The \"copy/look up/share\" pops up when I am reading and scrolling and I never want it to.\n\nA: It's not automatic, it shows when you highlight some text, by holding down on a paragraph of selectable text. It's not possible to disable this action.\nOne failure mode of the digitizer is that it will select areas on the screen randomly - if you open up an app like the calculator - if buttons there get pressed randomly when you aren’t actively moving a digit on the screen, that’s a good indicator your hardware is failing.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13 inch 2017 W/ touch bar - battery drain during sleep OS Version I'm on is High Sierra 10.13.2\nMy battery seems to drain way too much on my new MacBook Pro 13 w/ Touch bar 2017 when it's supposed to be sleeping.

So I did as suggested in reply.  Nothing was open preventing sleep.  20hrs this time on sleep and down to 78%.  This can't be right!\n\nA: If you open Activity Monitor there is an Energy tab that will display what is consuming the most energy. One of the columns is \"Preventing Sleep\", which will allow you to see if any apps are preventing your Mac from sleeping. It could be that it isn't sleeping when you think it is.\nIf you leave Activity Monitor open for a while it will gather data and you can look through and see what the biggest culprits are for energy usage. You could have a program that hangs and uses more power than it's supposed to.\n", "Q: local snapshot not restoring in APFS file system Using tmutil localsnapshot I was able to create snapshot(in this format: com.apple.TimeMachine.2017-12-28-032610), but was not able to revert to this snapshot using tmutil restore since APFS doesn't show me the path to this snapshot.\nAny way to fix this?\n\nA: Restoring from a snapshot happens when you run the migration assistant or boot to recovery HD / internet recovery.\nFollow the restore steps from:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\nThe tmutil restore command is targeted at one or several individual file copies from my interpretation of the manual page and using it in practice.

In my home country we have switched off FM radio and done a full transition to DAB+. \nSo, I'm now in the market for a portable dongle (or similar) that will enable me to listen to DAB through my iPhone.\nI have come across the POPyourPHONE product that is compatible with Android devices that support OTG and the Lingo iRis for iPhone 4 (1, 2). However, I haven't yet come across a similar device compatible with modern iPhones.\nMy iPhone has a Lightning connector, but how the dongle connects to my iPhone is not so critical (i.e. it could connect via Bluetooth or even using Apple's Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter). \nThe main requirement is that I can use my iPhone to listen to DAB+ radio, preferably with my AirPods. It would be strongly preferable if incoming phone calls were handled OK and that radio could play outside of any dedicated apps.\nCan anyone recommend/suggest a product that will meet these needs?\n\nA: I offer this answer as a possible software solution to meet your needs, although any software solution will require data usage.\nI've just checked and TuneIn Radio is available on the Norwegian iOS App Store. For full details refer to https://itunes.apple.com/no/app/tunein-radio/id418987775?mt=8\nI've personally been using TuneIn Radio for many years now and have generally been very happy with it. It provides access to over 100,000 radio stations and even offers users the ability to submit station requests in the event a station you want to listen to isn't available.\nThere is also a Pro version available (obviously at a cost).\nNOTE: I am not affiliated in any way with TuneIn Radio.\n", "Q: How to accept Apple Music Family invite without iOS/macOS? A couple of days ago I upgraded my Apple Music subscription to family mainly so my sisters could access music from their iPhones. Since my dad is avid music listener I decided to set up Apple Music for him also on his Windows laptop.\nI sent the invite via email and then we created an Apple ID for him with this same email address. But there seems to be no way how to accept this invite without owning Apple device or at least Android one. This seems odd since iTunes is basically the Apple Music for macOS/Windows.\nIn my family sharing settings I still see the invite as sent and when I open iTunes on his Windows machine there is no indication that there is Apple Music family invite.\nHave I missed anything or is this simply impossible? \nEDIT: I found a solution. I created new user account on my Mac, signed in with dad's Apple ID and the Family Sharing invitation popped right up. iTunes on Windows now works fine.\nStill would be nice to know if it is possible to accept invitation without Mac or spare iOS device..\n\nA: No - you'll want to find a spare iOS device for your father's account to log in and accept the invitation. (or backup / wipe / set up your device for him - then wipe / restore your backup so that you don't mix streams of data signing out and then signing in as his account).\nThis would clearly be a bug and something you might be able to call Apple Support to see if they can push an alternate way to authenticate your father to the group.\nMy guess is the account is either blocked and needs apple push notification to tie it to a physical device one time and then it will work from windows. I've done this a handful of times for people that primarily are on Windows without needing to engage official support.\n\nA: As for 2022, Apple Music or iTunes seems to support accepting invitations on Windows or Android.\nI have tried accepting invitation on my Android device. Then Apple sent an email to me with a \"get start\" link. What I have to do next is to open this link with Apple Music application. If on Windows, the case should be opening with iTunes application.\n", "Q: No compatible version of java 1.5 is available First thanks for reading my post and willing to help.\nI'm trying to run a program (MultiWiiConf 2.4, last version now) on my Mac (Sierra 10.12.6) but it won't launch and error No compatible version of java 1.5 is available is raised.\nThen, after searching the web, I checked Java parameters and I have version 9.0.1 installed.

Java 6 came out in 2006\nYou can get Java 6 from Apple and Java 7.8 or 9 from Oracle.\nAs for where java is installed. It's complex. /Library/Internet Plug-Ins is for web app Java not from Apple this would not set a Java in the terminal.\nThe java -version result implies that you do not have any Java installed.\nFirst step is to ask the program's author where you can get a modern version of their app from which does not use an insecure unsupported version of Java. Then install that Java\n\nA: You are getting that command line error because to execute Java you need the full JDK\nFrom Java.com\n\nWhen I try to use java from the command line, why doesn't it work? I\nhave Oracle's version of the JRE installed.\nInstalling a JRE from Oracle does not update java -version symlinks or\nadd java to your path. For this functionality, you must install the\nfull JDK.\n\n\n\nThe main thing that I don't understand is that java is supposed to be\ninstalled in /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/, but this folder is actually\nempty.\n\nThere's a difference between the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and the Java Internet Plugins. Downloading and installing Java allows you to launch Java applets on web pages, it doesn't give you access to execute Java apps via the command line.  To compile and execute Java applications (like the MultiWii controller software), you need the JDK.\n", "Q: Apple Watch screen not turning off anymore Usually my Apple Watch's screen turns on when I raise my arm, and then it turns off either when I put my arm down, or if I leave my arm in that position for 15 seconds.

When I raise my arm, the screen remains on even when I put my arm down, and also doesn't seem to turn off even when I wait for it to.\nWhat can I do in this circumstance?\n\nA: I fixed this by restarting both my watch and my paired phone simultaneously (restarting only the watch potentially would have solved the problem).

So I just have this question because one time when I was cleaning my MacBook with a damp wet cloth, I started cleaning my trackpad but I didn't notice that I was clicking it very hard so I immediately took of the cloth and I stared testing whether my trackpad was working correcting by clicking random stuff it felt weird however after some 3 secs it worked perfectly fine like brand new. Should I worry about hardware damage to my force touch trackpad.\nPS. I had also run a hardware test on my Mac and it reported \n\"No Issues found\"\n\nA: The force trackpad is a piece of glass that doesn't move, but provides feedback based on where your fingers are using motors. Cleaning it with the damp cloth probably confused it as to where your fingers were, providing strange feedback until it dried a little.\nBut yes, really pushing your trackpad really hard could hurt it just like pushing on a piece of glass really hard can break it, but that seems unlikely given the strength of the glass.\nAs a fun experiment, shutdown your mac while clicking on the trackpad. You can tell when it shuts down completely because the trackpad stops clicking.\n", "Q: Clean AirPods/EarPods Earwax?

If I connect my MacBook to a monitor with no speakers, and use it in clamshell (with the lid closed) will there be no sound / volume? Or will any sound be muffled becaused the lid is closed?\nHow will I hear error noises or new mail sounds or music? Will I also have to buy speakers? Or only buy a monitor with built in speakers?\n\nA: Just tested. It will play through the speakers with the clamshell closed and is very audible. It does change the sound quality so music might be a bit different (I din't play any music), but notifications will be easily discernible.\nTried some music and it comes through quite clearly, just a little quieter than with the lid open.\n\nA: Given that the MacBook lid is not soundproof, you will hear sound with the lid closed in closed clam shell mode.  Will it be muted?  Yes; it's obviously being blocked.  But, will you be prevented from hearing alerts and notifications?  No.\nIf you are setting up external peripherals, a decent set of speakers isn't out of order.\n", "Q: How the iOS can access to apple watch and airpod at the same time? I thought the Bluetooth module can connect to only one another device, but iPhone(or any iOS device) can be connected with Apple Watch and AirPod at the same time. How can it be possible? Is there any additional module in iOS device? If yes, why can't i make another double connection except Apple Watch or AirPods?\n\nA: Bluetooth can only connect to 1 device of a type at a time.\nFor example, you can only connect to 1 pair of headphones (AirPods) or 1 mouse at a time.  You can connect to multiple devices (AirPods and a mouse) at the same time because these are different devices.\nYou didn't provide enough info on the devices you can't connect to, the errors you received (if any), or the troubleshooting steps you've already taken, for me to assist you with the \"double connection\" in your question.  Please see Help and then edit your question to include all relevant info.\n\nA: Bluetooth has evolved. Now you can connect to multiple devices even if they are in the same category (e.g. two different speakers). It’s just most phones are not capable or simply not designed to send audio to two Bluetooth devices at the same time (technically possible, such as the Dual Audio feature on Samsung’s S8 with Bluetooth 5). However, the data transmission speed are still not comparable to many other connection methods. \nAlso note that when using AirPods, your iPhone is actually connected to three components — two AirPods, and one charging case. meanwhile, Apple is using some proprietary technologies (including the W1 chip) to create a even more seamless experience. \nMaybe we will see dual audio on iOS devices in years to come. But for now, Apple has AirPlay 2 which is even more powerful than dual audio on Bluetooth.\n", "Q: how can I filter out unwanted search results in Alfred (ie node_modules folder, caches) Been a user of Alfred for a long time, however whenever I search anything I get a lot of FUD results due to alfred also indexing all my web project node_modules directories. \nIs there any way to path-match and exclude all results from within a /node_modules/ directory? This would greatly improve the utility of the search. \n\nA: You can also add alfred:ignore to the spotlight comments of the folder that you want exclude, in your case the node_modules folder. \n\nA: This issue has been in discussion on the Alfred Forum since 2013 and unfortunately the answer is that Alfred can't really omit \"node_modules\" without you tagging all folders with the alfred:ignore tag. This would of course involve yet another script so it's overkill.\nThere is an alternative solution though: switch to yarn 2 and this issue with Alfred will implicitly go away!

I've already saved the contact for our current Acme rep on my iPhone.  Today our rep is Pete, but recently it was Susie, and in the future it might be Phil.  I don't remember what the rep's name is off the top of my head, but I do care that they're the person to call for Acme.\nHow can I see the company name in my contacts list while still recording the rep's name?\n\nA: Just enter the company name and omit the first and last name of the representative. Put the numbers under category Work or Main. You can have more than one entry in any particular category, unlike Android.\n\nA: Make your contacts with as much info as you have.\nUsing your example, make one for Pete as first name, no last name, and put acme in as the company.\nRepeat again for Susie and Phil. Adding acme as the company to each.\nNow open contacts and type acme in the search box.

I have an admin account with a password, yet the system won't authorise it. The prompt just shakes around as if the password was incorrect. However, I'm able to log into my account without problems, so I assume the login details are fine.\nI've noticed that the \"Username\" field is blank by default (while usualy it's already there when the prompt appears) - please see the attached image file. Even if I type the username manually, it still wouldn't work.\n\nNot sure what to do about it, I've never seen anything like this. Any help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: Navigate to Macintosh HD->Users and see what your username folder is, and use that when prompted.\nSometimes the username and name you see aren't always the same. As an example, I have profiles named Christian (Work) and Christian (Personal). The actual usernames are christian and christianpersonal, respectively. When prompted for an admin, I have to use christian to gain access. This is because I have changed the profile name after it was first created, giving it a different viewing name than the user folder.\n", "Q: Add a persistent message to iPhone main lock screen I am looking for ways to have a permanent custom message/note on the primary lock screen on iOS 10+\nHave tried Lock Screen Note which does it via push notification, but problem is that as soon as I unlock the screen, the notification disappears and I have to re-activate the message in order to have it again.\nAny other suggestions?

Depending on your frequency of changing the note and preference for it looking good anything from a imitation notification to a hand scribbled note could be achieved.\n\nA: You could try Apple Configurator, available for free on the Mac App Store. Once you’ve downloaded the app, you can set up a configuration that includes a persistent message. Be warned that this forces you to wipe your device, and that restoring from a backup will (as one may expect) wipe the configuration.

It has a completely wiped hard drive, and I'm trying to install Windows on it. I have a Windows 10 Installer USB drive that works fine on other computers. By this I mean in other computers, the BIOS lists the USB drive as a boot option and works as expected.\nBut in the Macbook Startup Manager (accessed by holding the option key while the computer is booting), it is not an option.\nIf I use a live Linux USB (I've tried arch and debian) it works as expected, debian installed on the Macbook with no problems.\nWhat can I do to fix this? Also keep in mind there is no operating system installed on the system, so I can't use any OSX utilities, but I can use Linux utilities.\n\nA: Here are the steps I would use to install Windows 10 your Mac. I assume you have a Windows 10 iso file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the current macOS operation system to your Mac. Currently this High Sierra version 10.13.2. The accomplishes two tasks. First, you will get all the logic board firmware updates. This is done in the background, so you will never know if a firmware update occurs. You used to have to manually install firmware updates, but as you can see from the legacy firmware update site, Apple now does update automatically. Second, you will get the latest version of the Boot Camp Assistant application. You can use this application to create the USB Windows 10 installer flash drive.\n\nNote: The newer Macs can install Windows 10 without the use of a USB flash drive.\n\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10. \nIf you do not want macOS installed on your Mac, then you can delete macOS during the installation of Windows 10. If you reach the window shown below, select \"Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)\". \n\nNext, remove macOS by deleting all the partitions. The result should be the same as shown below.\n\nWith the unallocated space highlighted, select \"Next\". The windows installer will automatically create the correct partitions.\nThe answer to your question\nYou Mac will not boot from the flash drive because the drive is not FAT formatted using a MBR partitioning scheme. If your drive is FAT formatted using a MBR partitioning scheme, then the firmware on your logic board is not up-to-date.\n", "Q: Target Display Mode troubles, can't disconnect anymore I used to run my 15\" MBP with 21.5\" iMac in Target Display Mode and everything was fine for a while. But as of a couple recent macOS upgrades, every time I disconnect, the iMac never restores to it's previous state. The screen is black. Once in a while, after 10 minutes or longer, it would come back. But more often than not, I have to power-cycle my iMac.\nI have tried every way possible to connect/disconnect. Different port combos, Apple genuine cable, unplugging Thunderbolt physically, Cmd+F2. All of this used to work, but not anymore. \nIt's really annoying because even if I let my MBP go to hibernate/sleep/screen-off, I end up having to power-cycle my iMac.\nAny suggestions would really be appreciated. Is anyone having this experience, as it doesn't seem common? \nI have not found anyone complaining about this exact problem.\n\nA: I have the same issue and here’s why it’s a software bug.\nOn my 2013 21.5\" iMac (base model with the only upgrade being a factory installed 256GB SSD). I've never had any work done on it.\nI attached an external drive running 10.11 El Capitan and booted from it. Activated target display mode, then deactivated it. NO ISSUE, IT WORKED! So I thought maybe there's something corrupted in my install and I have to erase and start from scratch. Before I did that, I clean installed Mac OS High Sierra on my external drive. ISSUE REOCCURED on a fresh install! Then I installed the Mojave Beta to see if Apple fixed it. NOPE it still cannot deactivated Target Display mode without screwing up the internal monitor!\nI've discovered though that plugging in an external DisplayPort display to the iMac \"re-wakes\" the internal display as it activates the external one. It's only slightly better than having to restart, as you still need to reach behind and plug in and out cables. Frustrating. I have an open ticket with Apple Support.\nBasically, the problem isn't our computers or our installs. It's Mac OS High Sierra and Mojave (and maybe regular Sierra, I can't tell). El Capitan doesn't have this problem.\n", "Q: Why do my earbuds keep changing the volume up and down whenever I move the wire? I've already tested my earbuds out on my computer and my guitar amp by moving around and constants flapping the wires and pushing them, so the problem is isolated to my iPhone only (I have the iPhone SE). It's weird because the sound almost cuts out for a second, then the volume turns down to a very quiet setting, and after a second or so the volume will turn back up to what it was originally.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not using Apple earbuds.\n\n*I have an iPhone SE.\n\n\nA: My guess would be that you are in a noisy environment, using your earphones, as you say, plugged into your phone.\nThis happened to my while riding my motorbike with earphones on. The built-in microphone is being hit by a lot of noise, and then the signal is sent and your phone OS tries to protect you by lowering the volume.\nTry the same earphones with some tape on the microphone (a tiny hole somewhere on the earphones), or try them in any situation without a lot of outside noise.\nIf they work ok, your problem is what I'm telling you about.\nThere is a few choices you can take to fix your problem. I'll state them so the first options are the cheapest or more reasonable ones.\n1. Search for a setting on you IOS, or an app to make volume not depend on outside noise.

Typically, to get to the maximum 32GB RAM, users have 4 x 8GB RAM chips installed (one in each slot).\nThe configuration I've personally seen the most is 24GB RAM installed, made up of the two 4GB chips originally installed by Apple and an additional two 8GB chips installed by the end user in the two remaining slots. 24GB RAM is nothing to sneeze at.\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*The RAM your iMac needs must meet the following specs: 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM\n\n*Apple provides  full instructions on how to install RAM in an iMac \n\n", "Q: Can Login Items be added via the command line in High Sierra? Can Login Items be added via a command in terminal?\nI would like to add a few essential utilities like ShiftIt and Alfred to my Login Items via a script when I'm configuring a new Mac. In versions of macOS previous to High Sierra these items were stored in a plist in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist but since High Sierra has been released it seems they've been migrated to be loaded via a new mechanism. \nI am interested in ways to set Login Items from a terminal primarily for High Sierra but interested from an academic perspective to know how it could be done in prior releases of macOS.\n\nA: macOS Catalina Update: While the information in this answer holds true as stated and tested in the versions of OS X/macOS listed below, it does not work in macOS Catalina 10.15.\n\nI tested the following under macOS 10.14.6, macOS 10.13.1 and OS X 10.8.6.\nIn Terminal, using the following syntax:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to make login item at end with properties {path:\"/path/to/itemname\", hidden:false}'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: If there are spaces in a path filename, do not escape the spaces with a backslash (\\) when it is in quotes.\nTested with an application named EventScripts:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to make login item at end with properties {path:\"/Applications/EventScripts.app\", hidden:false}'\n\nIt returned:\nlogin item UNKNOWN\n\nWhich is apparently the normal output with this command and was verified by preforming the same action in Script Editor.  \nThen looking in System Preferences > Users & Groups > $USER > Login Items, EventScripts was added.\n\nNotes:\nIn OS X 10.8.6 it updated the following file:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist\n\nIn macOS 10.13.1[1] it updated the following file:\n~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm\n\nWhich, by the way, is also a plist file, but with a btm extension.\nYou can also delete a Login Item from Terminal using the following syntax:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to delete login item \"name\"'\n\nWhere \"name\" in the command is as show in the output of the following command:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get the name of every login item'\n\n\n[1] Update: The backgrounditems.btm file is still the target file since macOS 10.13.1 and later.\n\nA: On Catalina & beyond the path to Applications has changed, so, adding Login Items might require using something like \"/System/Applications/Awesome App.app\"\n", "Q: iOS Smart Invert dulls colors I use Smart Invert (Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations > Invert Colors > Smart Invert) extensively. But when I enable Smart Invert colors become slightly dull, especially reds, see image:\n\nOn the left is the Health icon with Smart Invert, on the right is the Health icon without smart invert. The icon on the right is slightly brighter. The effect is really visible when you toggle Smart Invert a couple times while on the home screen.\nThis is on an iPhone 8+, on a brand new installation of iOS 11.2.1. I have no color filters enabled and True Tone and Nightshift are turned off. My iPad Air, that doesn't have True Tone doesn't have the problem.\nI want this effect to go away, ideally the icons on the home screen look exactly the same with of without smart invert. Also, I'm using icons as an example, but the effect is visible everywhere, also on photos or YouTube videos for instance, which is a bit annoying.\n\nA: This may or may not be related to how smart invert and neither night shift NOR true tone can operate together. Try your comparison with night shift off?\nEdit: I tested it some more, and although true tone being off affects the tone a lot, the visual hues of non-inverted items in smart invert do look a lot more desaturated and just generally poopy. I think there is some incorrect colorspace handling going on in here. \nWhen I take a screenshot in smart invert mode, the actual saved image appears to be truly inverted. this seems to indicate to me that under the hood everything does get inverted, and smart invert actually goes in and re-inverts some of the things back that it thinks shouldn't have gotten inverted. This process is likely what fails to bring colors back to their original vibrance.\n\nA: It definitely has something to do with True Tone, because devices without TT like the 5S run Smart Invert with vibrant colors. When you disable True Tone through settings, you aren't fully disabling it, just permanently setting the display to a cool temperature, where as Smart Invert seems to fully disable True Tone, resulting in dull colors.\n", "Q: Terminal freezes with beach ball on High Sierra My terminal frequently freeze with a spinning beach ball of doom.

Also, in the second column it seems that both hdds have 24 and 23 links to them.  Is this normal?  Thank you.\n\nA: Those colors indicate that you are in a directory that's writable by others and the sticky bit isn't set.  This is defined by the attributes in the first column: drwxrwxrwx\nWhat this is telling you is that it's a directory, the user, group, and others all have read, write, and execute permissions on the file.  This would be the equivalent of issuing chmod 777 on that directory\nIn the other volume (WDred) it has the attributes drwxrwxr-x which means it's a directory, the user and group have read, write and execute rights while others can only read and execute (no write permissions).  This is the equivlant of chmod 775.\nPermission Attributes\nThe first character is is the type\n-    regular file\nd    directory\nl    symbolic link\nn    network file\ns    socket\n\nThe next nine characters are the permissions for, in order by groups of three, owner, group, others\nr    Permission to read file\nw    Permission to write to file\nx    Permission to execute file\na    Archive bit is on (file has not been backed up)\nc    Compressed file\ns    System file\nh    Hidden file\nt    Temporary file\n\nColorized output\nThe color you are seeing is not indicative of the permissions set in the system - it's a customization you control to help you identify things.\nYou must \"ask\" for colorized output with the command ls -G (my ls has been aliased to be ls -laGh meaning list, all, color, human readable).\nNext and optionally, you must specify your colors in an environment variable LSCOLORS which would look something like this\nexport LSCOLORS=\"exfxcxdxcxegedabagacad\"\n\nEach attribute has a pair of letters; the first one being directory.  The first pair is directory foreground and directory background.  ex would be blue with the default background.\nThere's an excellent LSCOLOR Generator to see what the colors look like \"live\" \nFor a full description of what the colors are and how they are tied to attributes view the man page for ls (man ls) and look for the LSCOLORS section. \n", "Q: Time Machine on High Sierra failure I have tried a lot of things but I keep getting failed backups when doing a first backup on High Sierra.

I currently use my 4th generation Apple TV as my smart home hub.\nThe only accessories connected at the moment are Philips Hue lights, but I plan to increase this - hence the need for a more integrated voice activation system in the home rather than doing everything from an iPhone.\nAs Apple's HomePod is likely to cost around six times the price of an Amazon Echo Dot 2, I was wondering if the Echo would be a viable solution since my devices are controlled from a HomeKit hub, rather than the proprietary hub that comes with the Hue lights.\nCould the Echo Dot 2 connect to my Hue lights through my Apple TV hub?\nIf not, would it be possible to use a proprietary Hue hub in conjunction with the Apple TV? In theory that would allow independent, yet synced, control of the lights through either one of the systems?\nWould either of these solutions be possible?\n\nA: Philips Hue Bulbs are controlled by the Philips Hue Bridge or other ZigBee compatible bridge. HomeKit and Apple TV don't function as a true bridge or hub as it requires other hubs and bridges to connect to smart devices. The Apple TV simply gives you a remote connection from Apple TV to iOS over internet via iCloud.\nHue Bulb --(ZigBee)--> Hue Bridge --(LAN)--> HomeKit via Apple TV --(LAN/WAN)--> iOS device\n\nNow, you can't use Amazon Echo with HomeKit, but this doesn't matter. Amazon uses Hue Bridge's built-in APIs to connect to Hue. Amazon and Hue can connect regardless of your HomeKit setup.\nHue Bulb --(ZigBee)--> Hue Bridge --(LAN/WAN)--> Amazon Echo\n\nYou can use both HomeKit and Amazon Echo (including Dot, Plus, Spot, and Show) in conjunction with HomeKit via iOS and Apple TV, provided you have the Hue Bridge as your controller.\n\nA: My partner and I were looking at this this morning. She's just buying us a house and wants to go Smart Home.\nThe Echo Plus contains a built-in bridge that will talk directly to Hue, but can't (yet) do some of the higher functions like colour cycling.\nSo to add to @drivec's answer, it looks like this:\nHue bulb --(LAN)--> Amazon Echo Plus.\n\nI don't know whether the cost of the Echo Plus (~£140) is better or worse than the cost of an Echo plus a Hub, but there's certainly less stages to the connection where something could go wrong. As to whether the same bulb can take commands from more than one source (the AppleTV and the Echo) I don't know.\nAnd of course, trying to Google that gives me a much better answer:\nhttps://digitized.house/2016/08/idevices-bridges-apple-homekit-amazon-alexa-worlds/\nUse the iDevices app. This allows you to talk to HomeKit via Alexa on an Echo.\n", "Q: Test iPhone SE without a battery. Possible? In this thread, apparently you can test a iPhone without a battery.\nTest iPhone 4s hardware without battery. Possible?\nWhat about iPhone SE? Is it possible to check if the mainboard and screen is working by disconnecting the battery and then connecting the lightning cable to the mains? \nThe reason I wnt to do is to check if the lightning connector pins are damaged. By applying 3.8 V directly on the pins where the battery would have been connected and then pressing the power button, the phone booted up ( I see a current fluctuation between 0.15 and 0.72 A on the multimeter ) . But if I do try to power on the device just with the lightning connector, it doesnt. So, if it is possible technically to boot an iphone SE without a battery, then the connectors are damaged.\n\nA: The battery is required to boot the device. Once it has booted, you can leave the Lightning cable connected and then disconnect the battery.\n\nA: I don’t see why it wouldn’t work on a iPhone SE if it works on other phones. Just make sure you don’t unplug it or else it will shut off right away as there will be no battery to power it.\n", "Q: How to create AppleID of another country without having a credit card or bank account of that country, but with a country Internet connection? What is up-to-date and tried method to create AppleID of another country without having a credit card or bank account of that country?\nI am on a short visit in another country (Estonia in my case), so having a genuine-local internet connection is a completed step :-)\n\nA: Disconnect if you are logged in with an Apple ID, go to AppStore, try to get an app, select the “create a new account” option and you will be able to create an Apple ID without a card. You can add the card (I think but it is almost sure) after you come back in your country. \n\nA: Turned out I don't even need an internet connection, banking card or even mobile number of the required (\"destination\") country. Only prepare a email you never used for creating AppleID. On iOS device (iOS 11.3 as an example):\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign Out of AppStore: Settings > iTunes & App Store\n\n*Sign Out of iCloud: Settings > (your username) > Sign Out in the bottom of the screen (!--this is key to being able to create new account in the next step)\n\n*AppStore > find any free app > tap Get\n\n*In menu {Use Existing AppleID | Create New AppleID | Cancel}, choose Create\n\n*When registering:\n\n\n*\n\n*enter any legit address as Billing Address in the country\n\n*use whatever mobile phone number you have; it can be your home country mobile\n\n\n\nAs a result you get AppleID with 2FA already activated on it.\nOn a downside the wallet in your original AppleID will lose all the credit cards; some apps seem to reset previous authentication (eg Instagram asks for OTP upon reinstallation, which it normally doesn't). Other data loss can also potentially happen.  \n\nTranslated from macdigger.ru, with a bit of my experience re signing out of iCloud and choosing verification mobile phone. \n\nA: You can simply visit Apple ID Website and create an Apple ID without needing to provide any payment information. You can easily select the country of your choice. It's required to use a previously unused email ID for creating this Apple ID. This approach comes in handy when you do not have access to a Mac or do not wish to change the country on your iOS device as it just requires access to a Web browser on any computer.\nRefer to this Apple Support article, Create or use your Apple ID without a payment method for official and up-to-date instructions.\n", "Q: iOS: auto-repair unreliable/malfunctioning Wi-Fi connection? All too often, iOS fails to automatically detect and repair faulty/unreliable Wi-Fi connections, which means I have to go into settings and manually reset it. Incredibly annoying and downright stupid.\nMost of the time the fix is no more than manually reconnecting. You'd think that this would be automatic, especially with auto-join enabled. Other times I have to manually connect to another hotspot that was already on auto-join (which means that the auto-join feature is broken, low-quality, or failed).\nOther times, a Wi-Fi connection stops responding and the Wi-Fi indicator on the iOS device fails to indicate that (access available to hotspot and no internet access available).\nI'd like a configuration or utility (can be a third-party tool) that auto-repairs the Wi-Fi connection.\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detect spotty access and intermittent outages on Wi-Fi hotspot; automatically reconnect to hotspots marked as auto-join without any input from the user.\n\n*Link, network, and transport layer monitoring and profiling to detect errors and failed/unreliable connections. \n\n*Automatically drop low-quality hotspots (those that drop many packets, lack proper internet access, or often fail to respond for any reason) and connect to higher-quality hotspots without input from the end-user.\n\n*If a Wi-Fi hotspot goes out or becomes unreliable, it should automatically switch to another auto-join hotspot.\n\n*Round-robin poll-and-connect for multiple failed hotspots: Maintain a list of auto-join hotspots and repeatedly attempt to join each one in turn. Make every effort so the end-user doesn't have to manually go into settings and do what should have been automated from the beginning.\n\n*(Bonus - no idea if this can be done in iOS) Automatically monitor failed connections/timeouts and launch connection auto-repair on failed connection.\n\n*(Bonus) Parallel reconnect. When the iOS device loses its Wi-Fi connection, make connection attempts on all auto-join hotspots in range (in parallel) and associate with the first one that accepts.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to configure your wifi settings without jailbreaking and installing a non-approved third-party application. By default applications on iOS devices are not granted access to configure wifi settings. Sorry.\n", "Q: What is main difference in a portable external HDD and a regular external HDD? I have an external 3 TB WD drive for backup. I think it is shot so I want to replace it. I don't need a portable drive but if they are more durable I'd like to get one. The cost difference between portable and regular is negligible at Amazon. Are there any issues associated with using a portable HDD for a Time Machine backup?\n\nA: There's a small difference. A portable HDD draws power directly from your computer while an external HDD draws power from a power adapter plugged into the wall. Durability will vary depending on quality. If you're using a portable device (such as a laptop) it is suggested to use a portable HDD so you don't have to plug it in elsewhere. It should also be noted that portable HDDs draw more power from your computer which may result in faster battery consumption on portable devices or worse performance on devices using a very little amount of power (such as a Raspberry Pi).\n\nA: hello Mr please note that HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive there are two types of hard one fixed and other is portable there is no difference between them just portable give you facility to move it from one place to another for use it on other PC(externally) but if you consider SSD Solid State Drive yes here is difference SSD hard is more faster than HDD and also expensive than HDD.\n", "Q: Difficulties with 4k60 support on my Late 2013 27\" iMac I have a late 2013, 27\" iMac with a GeForce GTX 780M graphics card, which I'm trying to get to connect to two 4k displays (Asus MG28U) at 60Hz. When I connect them, I am limited to 30Hz (but importantly, the 3820x2160 resolution does work):\n\nI also have an early 2015 MacBook Pro, which supports these displays at 4k60. This confirms that the cables I'm using (Mini DisplayPort to Display port) are not the limiting factor). Interestingly, the preference pane looks different on my MacBook Pro, offering a bunch of scaling options, with no mention of refresh rate (although I can visually confirm it's 60 Hz):\n\nI am trying to figure out why these two computers treat these monitors differently, and show different settings for them. \nThere is conflicting information about 4k support on this Mac. According to Apple's official technical specifications for this (iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) - Technical Specifications), its limited to only 2560x1600:\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display\n  and up to a 30-inch display (2560 by 1600 pixels) on an external\n  display\n\nThis is clearly (no longer) correct, given then my iMac is running two of these displays at 3840 x 2160 at 30hz.\nApple's page on Mac 4k support (Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac) contradicts this, claiming that 4K60 is supported for SST displays (emphasis mine):\n\nWith OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and later, most SST 4K (3840 x 2160)\n  displays are supported at 60Hz on these Mac computers:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and later\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) and later\n  \n*Mac Pro (Late 2013)\n  \n*iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) and later\n  \n*MacBook Air (Early 2015)\n  \n\n...\n\nMulti-stream transport (MST) displays\nThese Mac computers support MST displays at 60Hz:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) and later\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and later\n  \n*Mac Pro (Late 2013)\n  \n*iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later\n  \n\nAssuming this information is correct (I'm skeptical given the contradictions) this iMac can support 4k60Hz for SST displays, but not MST displays. In that case, I suspect that these Asus MG28U displays use MST, but I cannot find any information regarding whether they're SST or MST.\nHas anyone gotten 4k60 to work with a late 2013, 27\" iMac? Is there some setting or something that I am missing? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: DisplayPort v1.2 -- vs 1.0 and 1.1 -- newly supported 60Hz UHD (4k), where the older specification had only enough speed to support 30Hz.  [Search \"specifications displayport\".  (On the Wikipedia page, you have to look at two separate tables.)]\nI would infer that DisplayPort port on the older machine was v1.0 or v1.1, with the newer machine's being v1.2 (or higher).  (Apparently your cable is v1.2 (or higher).)\nSince the two machines are running the same version of the OS, I would guess that the difference in the presentation of the resolution is a function of the DisplayPort version... although I would have thought that it was the OS itself.  [\"Larger text\" means (non-native) larger dots on the same screen (and fewer of them), and \"More space\" means, in the last case, full native resolution.]\nAs for the Apple specification page... one might wonder if there was an improvement in the hardware capability enabled by the software (i.e. the OS)... but I would guess that it actually was a mistake (surprisingly enough); the NVidia specifications for all the pertinent graphics cards say 3840x2160.  [I note that Apple has been known to cripple its hardware -- as in, such that you can get more than advertised, out of it -- on occasion [ref. incl. my own machine], but I can/do not see that here.]\nBTW, my experience with my dual-panel display (which I think is \"MST\") is that you can catch it out sometimes, with one side lagging behind the other briefly.\n", "Q: Safari history disappears despite settings I like to have my browser history span years back so I can look at things which may have interested me a long time ago. To pursue this desire, I have set Safari to remove history items \"manually\" under the General tab in the Preferences. I have done the same thing for download list items. My intent was (and is) to not remove history items ever and to keep Safari from doing it automatically.\nThis seemed to be working fine for a while, and I still have history which goes back more than a year. However, I have recently noticed that the oldest days in my history are disappearing. At first I wasn't sure, but after conducting some tests I am sure. It seems to happen randomly and infrequently. I think that the Safari window also loses focus when it happens.\nI am not sure how or why this is happening. The only thing I can think of is that there may be some hard-coded limit in Safari itself. Or perhaps it purges old history items when it reaches a memory limit.\nI see that my History.db file is 80MiB in ls output:\n  -rw-r--r--    1 my_username staff  80M Dec 29 13:02 History.db\n\nIs 80MiB some sort of implicit limit for Safari?\nAnother troubling facet of this issue is that I cannot export my Safari history to another browser. Both Chrome and Firefox refuse to import anything from Safari except bookmarks. Moreover, I do not have many backups of my Safari history. Although, backups would not help too much anyway since a backup would lack my recent history.\nSo how can I get Safari to stop losing my oldest history items?\nSome environment info:\nMy Safari version is currently 11.0.2 on macOS 10.13.2. Also, I am not using iCloud integration with Safari.\nEDIT:\nAt the time of the bounty on this question, I will also consider accepting answers which offer a way to export my history to another browser (preferably Firefox or Chrome).\n\nA: This is size limit imposed by Safari.\nA sqlite database can obviously be larger than 80M; it is only limited by the amount of available storage space, but technically it has an upper file size limit of about 140TB\nOther developers have noted that in (older versions of) Safari, the limit is capped at 50GB.  It's reasonable to assume that this limit has been increased in subsequent releases of macOS/iOS/Safari.\nIt also stands to reason that this size limit is imposed by (Apple) Safari because, by default, it is configured to synchronize with iCloud to other Apple devices many of which are constrained by storage availability (iPhones and iPads, for example).  \nWe also know that iCloud's basic (free) storage allotment is 5GB and this must account for much more than browsing history.  Things like files, settings, device backups (where applicable) keychains, notes, etc. must be allocated space.  Synchronization of these items is set by default by Apple.\nIt wouldn't make much sense to allow an unlimited history  where History.dbcould outstrip the capacity of iCloud/iPad/iPhone.  \nEven though you're not using iCloud integration, the average user does and Apple will architect it's products around this premise and design their products accordingly.  \nExtracting Your History\nYou can pull your history items out of the History.db file with this (very) simple sqlite3 script\nCreate a \"commands.txt\" file and populate it with the following commands:\n.mode csv\n.once history.txt\nselect visit_time, title, url from history_visits inner join history_items on history_items.id = history_visits.history_item;\n\nThen issue the command \nsqlite3 History.db < commands.txt\n\nThis will create a CSV file called history.txt containing the time, title and URL of the history items.  This assumes you are in the ~/Library/Safari directory.  Keep in mind that the date/time of your history item will be in epoch time (although the epoch is different in this case) and will need to be ultimately converted.\n\nA: Simple answer, no you cannot.\nI suggest you use Chrome and import your data with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install and start Chrome (close Safari) \n\n*Click on the 3 dots on the Top-right corner \n\n*Drag your cursor to \"Bookmarks\" then click on \"Import Bookmarks and Settings\"\n\n*You'll see 4 options, it is Select items to import: \"Browsing history\" \"Favorites/Bookmarks\" \"Saved passwords\" \"Search engines\"\n\n", "Q: Erase iOS device with recovery mode without updating to latest iOS version?

I am trying to prevent 2 volumes from mounting at startup.\nI created a new fstab using vifs and added the UUIDs of the volumes I don't want to mount at system startup, but for some reason this does not seam to work in High Sierra. Both volumes will mount as usual.\nAny idea what's missing?\nThe following syntax is what i used - \nUUID= none apfs rw,noauto\n\nA: EDIT 2: Unfortunately after upgrading to Big Sur, this no longer is sufficient.  You also have to edit /etc/fstab and add:\nUUID=[put UUID of volume here] none auto noauto\nEDIT: After more testing, it appears the ONLY change needed is to add the \"D\" for Data flag to the APFS volume.  /etc/fstab changes are not needed.\nI've changed the text below to show this.\n\nI got this to work on APFS volumes in macos Catalina 10.15.2 - I can't confirm if this works on earlier versions.

We got a new iMac for Christmas and it has seemed really slow for the past couple of days. In desperation I checked out Activity Monitor and it shows photoanalysisd as the guilty process that is hogging my CPU. I assume this is related to the Photos app, but that's not even running!\nWhat is \"photoanalysisd\", why is it using 77% of my CPU, and can I safely stop the process?\n\nA: Your iMac is currently processing the photos in your Photos library, presumably because you’ve just imported/converted an existing Photos library from an earlier version of macOS.\nIf you suspect this has been the cause of your sluggishness for a couple of days, then it’s most likely you’ve got a very large photo library and that it’s being processed for the first time on your new iMac.\nThe fact that Photos isn’t running actually fits with your scenario, as launching the Photos app will pause the photoanalysisd daemon.\nAlthough it takes a long time, once it’s finished your Photos app will be able to perform a lot of advanced functions due to all the metadata etc it’s processed, so I would let it finish what it’s doing.\nNOTE:\nShould you need to pause the process in order to free up some of your CPU, I would recommend just opening the Photos app for a while and then quitting it when you’re not using the computer. Note, however, that minimising the Photos app will act to restart the photoanalysisd daemon, so just leave it running in the background while you want to keep the daemon paused.\n\nA: After photoanalysisd had been taking up 3 cores for over a month, I found a solution that reduced the CPU usage dramatically for me on High Sierra. I went into Photos and added names to some pictures - 4 pictures in total using 3 names. Photoanalysisd is currently using 0% whether or not Photos is open.\n\nA: I have only a dozen or so photos in my library (this is my spare computer, my photos are on my main computer) and I've let the process run for a week, and it is still eating up 100% of both cores. My machine is unresponsive with the CPU fan at 100% (13\" MacBook Pro Mid-2010). None of the solutions I found on the web worked, I finally temporarily renamed my photo library to hide it from the deamon, and instantly had both CPUs go from 100% to around 5%.\n\nA: Might I suggest the use of App Tamer? \nIt lets you pause/stop a process when it reaches a % of the processor time.\nSince I use it, my computer temperature is always quite low.\nHope it helps!\nP.S.: I am not affiliated at all with App Tamer. I am just a happy customer!\n\nA: I don't use the Photos app and I have no photos in it. Still, my mac (Catalina) is regularly slow and sluggish due to this process. I've now renamed the Photos library which seems to help. It's annoying constantly having a process running for a feature that is not used. Surely Apple can detect wether they actually need to run this process?\n\nA: Update for 2019, 16\" MacBook Pro running Catalina 10.15.2:\n\n*\n\n*start Photos, let it continue past the first dialogue box;\n\n\n*now Preferences… in the main app menu under Photos just right after Apple logo is clickable (it wasn't before);\n\n\n*Preferences… (⌘+,) → General tab , and untick both check boxes in Memories;\n\n\n\n*close Photos.\nThis stops photoanalysisd cold, no reboot or kill required.\n\nA: In my case, it was photolibraryd and not photoanalysisd that was hogging CPU and also causing massive HD churn, but I'd like to provide an answer here that worked for me in stopping photolibraryd, because (1) I think these tips will work for stopping photoanalysisd too, (2) this page is one of the top Google results for people searching for info about photolibraryd, and (3) none of the advice on this page (as of 2021-07-01) worked for me in stopping photolibraryd.\n\nFirst, I was initially experiencing massive disk churn, particularly disk-writing not reading. This started when I moved the Photos library from one user account to another on the computer. This problem was partially due to the fact that my new account did not own the files inside the Photos Library bundle. I had to open the bundle (go to ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary and right-click it, then choose \"Show Package Contents\"), Get Info on each subfolder (database/, external/, originals/, etc.), and under the Sharing & Permissions section add my new user account, set its privileges to \"Read & Write\", and then click the ellipsis-in-a-circle button at the bottom and choose \"Apply to enclosed items…\". I had previously given myself Read & Write privileges for the overall Photos Library bundle, but this was not enough.\nGiving myself R&W access to all the contents stopped the disk-writing churn and the errors that were showing up in Console.app from photolibraryd, however it still continued to dump tons of non-error messages into Console and was reading continuously from the HD at 15MB/s for hours despite the fact that I don't have enough photos to occupy it for more than a couple minutes at that speed.\nAt this point, the advice here from mbackschat on 2020-01-03 worked instead, which is to rename the folder ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/database to something else (for example, to database.xxx). This confounds photolibraryd so that it stops thrashing the computer. Note that launching Photos after doing this will initiate a \"Restoring…\" process that recreates database/, so you will have to do this after each time you use Photos.\n\nA: launchctl disable user/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\nlaunchctl kill TERM gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\nkillall photoanalysisd\n\nrestart\nif that not help\nJust create new file call tcookiped.sh and then run it in terminal sh tcookiped.sh\nkillall -STOP photoanalysisd\n\nor\nwhile true; do\nkillall photoanalysisd\n\nsleep 10\ndone\n\n#killall -ABRT corespotlightd\n\n\nA: That process interferes severely with time machine by hogging all available CPU. It is the only process that I encountered so far that is that annoying. Now I finally stop the process manually through Activity Monitor > select CPU > select \"photoanalysisd\" > click red stop sign in top left – as soon as it starts to interfere with my work. Not a permanent solution, but at least I can use my machine for what it is intended.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15-inch booting halts and its screen becomes green The scenario is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot log in Mac OSX if booting normally as the booting halts and the screen becomes green with nothing else on it.\n\n*In Recovery mode, reinstall Sierra and previous EI Capitan, but the problem still exists.

On my MacOS 10.13.2 machine I am being inundated with network share login prompts literally every minute and they will not relent. If I ignore them and push them aside, they jump right back in my face. Pop-up ads aren't this insidious. Aside from the requirement to click \"OK\" to authenticate things already on your keyring, this is one my my least favorite changes in Sierra. I am not sure how I told AutoMounter that I want this network share that is on a NAS that no longer exists, but now I cannot find how to un-tell it because AutoMounter is attacking every 60 seconds.

I'd like to be able to run SolidWorks with Parallels or Bootcamp occasionally (for 3D printing model development). I believe it requires OpenGL.\nI am confused about the model configuration and capabilities. Will the 2.2GHz/16GB/256GB model suffice or do I need to go for 2.5/16/512 one?\nIt all started with this page: http://community.foundry.com/discuss/topic/122224, where 2.2/16/256 model seems to lack OpenGL capability altogether.\nAccording to https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/macs-released-in-2015.html, the 2.2/16/256 version doesn't have a dedicated graphics card, while the 2.5/16/512 does. First, can I trust this source? Any way to cross-check? Couldn't find this information on the Apple site. Second, is the dedicated graphics card required if I only need to run SolidWorks occasionally? I don't need so much SSD space, and wouldn't like paying for high-performance graphics unless I really need it.\nThe related Apple page doesn't mention this difference at all, and confused me into ordering 2.2/16/256 model at the moment. I am not sure I can return the computer once I create my user account or install the software, hence this question.\nThanks a ton for the answers/comments!\n\nA: \nFirst, can I trust this source?  Any way to cross-check?\n\nEverymac.com should be considered a trusted source.  This can be cross checked by looking at two sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple website; tech specs of 2015 MBP will tell you it uses an Intel Iris integrated graphics chipset\n\n*Info about Integrated video on Intel based Mac computers; also on Apple's website.\n\n\nBasically, Intel Pro Graphics (integrated graphics) uses shared memory of up to 1.5GB of system RAM.  There's no dedicated GPU.\n\nSecond, is the dedicated graphics card required if I only need to run\n  SolidWorks occasionally?\n\nDo you need it?  No, it's not required.  You may find that the performance (lack of) is something you can live with if you are only using it occasionally.\n\nI don't need so much SSD space, and wouldn't like paying for\n  high-performance graphics unless I really need it.\n\nOne factor you need to be cognizant of is that these models are completely un-upgradeable.  The best advice that I can give (which I personally live by) is purchase for what you think you will need tomorrow not what you need today.  Further, if the performance for what you want to do today is marginal at best, it's not going to get any better in the future.\nKeep in mind that the phrase, \"Gee, my graphics is just too responsive\" and \"I wish I didn't have so much storage\" was uttered by no one, ever.\n\nA: One of the best authorities on Mac models and their capabilities is MacTracker.\nhttp://mactracker.ca/\nThere is an iOS app, a desktop app, and a website..\nAll are highly accurate, WRT models and capabilities, as well as OS, firmware, and configurations.\nYou would do well to look thru here to get specifics on any version Mac you are considering.\n\nA: I appreciate the detailed answer and the follow up discussion with @Allan. Still I thought I'd give an experiment-based answer for this specific situation, in case someone is interested.\nI have picked up the 2015 MacBook Pro 256 GB / 16 GB / 2.2 GHz laptop, installed Parallels with Windows 10 and SolidWorks 2010 (the copy I've had at hand). It works, there were no questions about the graphics card, and I see no issues with rendering or part manipulation speed during the design work. The fans are not audible. \nSummary: While this computer has no discrete graphics GPU, it is suitable for hobby-level SolidWorks work. \n\nA: This is a little late, but I would just like to add another datapoint here for future reference.  For years I ran a 2010 13\" Macbook Pro (A1278), this only had a Core 2 Duo with a GeForce 320M for graphics.  There was a patch (maybe this link http://kb.parallels.com/en/122790) that allowed Solidworks to run with hardware OpenGl (it's an option under performance in SW).  It wasn't amazing but it was usable - the computer worked hard, but it didn't really slow you down at all.\nFast forward to a 2016 13\" Macbook Pro (with real esc and F keys) with an Intel Iris 540.  Same setup with parallels and Solidworks and I couldn't get OpenGl to work correctly which actually leads to some very weird performance issues.  Besides the computer itself working a lot harder then it should because it was doing everything through the CPU, the weird thing was rotating parts.  Basically it would be 100% responsive while rotating the part, but as soon as you stopped the rotation it would pause for ~1-2 seconds and you could watch it sequentially re-draw each line edge of the part.  This will really kill your workflow, and possibly drive you insane.  I spent some time trying to get it to run OpenGl via the integrated graphics but was unsuccessful.  If you try to find any info on parallels site you get endless pages on their forum of unhappy users wanting more then OpenGl 2.1 support (3.0 was released in 2008, 4.0 in 2010).  I don't know if this has improved in the last year or not because I changed to VMware Fusion which supports up to OpenGl 3.3.  \n", "Q: Smart search (save) - search folder names and list contents I'm setting up a list of smart folders which will search inside my sample library folder called 'Samples'.

But I was wondering, my sample library 'Samples' containes folders from the sample packs, and within the sample packs, there are folders called 'Bass Loops' etc.. Some of the sample packs may not have a name of Bass but are placed in the Bass Loops folder.\nSo rather than search a specific file name, I'd like to list all files in all folders called 'Bass Loops'. Is it possible to search multiple folder names like 'Bass Loops' and list all the contents?\nAlso, it's important to save the search folders.\n\nA: I don’t think this is possible in Finder.\nTo some extend, it is possible in HoudahSpot. Full disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot.\nIn HoudahSpot you can search several folders at once. You can also save your searches as “Templates”. You can use these as “smart folders” or as starting points for recurring searches. E.g. when you want to restrict the search to only loops of a certain bit rate, you can do so without having to start over.\nWhat you cannot do is to have HoudahSpot find all folders name “Bass Loops” and then search within these folders for audio files that are more than 2 seconds long.\nYou can however get rather close to achieveing this by filtering your search results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have HoudahSpot search your home folder for audio files that are\nmore than 2 seconds long.\n\n*Above search results, you will find the\nfilter field. Select the option to “Filter by path”\n\n*Type “Bass”.\n\n\nSo you start by having HoudahSpot find more files than you need. Then you filter the results to see only files that have “Bass” somewhere in the path or name.\nType “Bass*/*” for a filter if you want “Bass” to appear in the name of a parent folder. I.e. exlcude files named “Bass” located in any other folder. The “*” serves as wildcard. It matches any number of characters. In this case: a sequence of characters followed by a slash and then some more characters. Thus “Bass\" must be anywhere in the path, but not after the last slash.

I then manually deleted all playlists in the Music app and synced again (music sync was still disabled). This removed the playlists from iTunes (make a backup of your .itl-file before doing this if you follow these instructions) but left the non-playing tracks on the phone.

Then switch off the \"Allow Calls on Other Devices\" toggle switch and restart the phone. \nAlso worth mentioning: simply switching off the \"Allow Calls on Other Devices\" toggle switch does NOT solve the problem - the Macs remain in the audio options list even if that option is off. You need to leave the option on and un-check each device before toggling the option off.  You may not see the audio choices change until the phone is restarted. \n\nA: Try turning off Bluetooth on both devices.

Thanks a bunch.\n\nA: When using APFS, the built-in macOS Recovery volume no long appears when the Startup Manager is invoked. You should be able to boot the the this volume by holding down the ⌘ (Command)+R key at startup or restart.\nIf you can not boot to the built-in macOS Recovery, reinstalling macOS may solve this problem.  This website has a link that will take you to the High Sierra download in the Apps Store.  You should be able to keep all your old files and Applications.\nIf you still want to boot the built-in macOS Recovery volume from the Startup Manager, then you will need to install a third party boot manager. I have the rEFInd Boot Manager installed on my iMac. Basically, I first boot to the Startup Manager, then to rEFInd and finally to the built-in macOS Recovery volume.\nIf your Windows files are intact, your problem with Windows could be solved by reinstalling the boot code. The procedure for doing so is given here. \n\nNote: I have assumed you did not upgrade to Windows 10 from a previous version of Windows that use the legacy BIOS boot method. For example, upgrading from Windows 7. I base this assumption on the lack of a Boot folder in the root of your BOOTCAMP volume.\n\nI should also mention that the 134.2 MB Apple_Boot partition is unnecessary. With the introduction of APFS, Apple has incorporated everything needed to use the macOS operating system into a single partition per drive. This greatly simplifies the process of adding, deleting and resizing APFS volumes. This physical 134.2 MB Apple_Boot partition has been replaced by the synthesized APFS volume named \"Recovery\".\n", "Q: Technical details behind Apple's performance throttling of the iPhone What are the technical details behind how a worn battery slows down the iPhone 6?\nWhy does replacing the battery with a new one fix the issue? Is it iOS doing the throttling or is it physical limitations of the hardware?\nRelevant news story on the subject\n\nA: Short answer\nTo answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The battery itself is not what's slowing the iPhone down, but rather iOS is deliberately doing this in the case of batteries that are below a certain level of health. \n\n*Inserting a new battery fixes this because iOS then determines that the iPhone has a power source capable of meeting the higher power demands sometimes required by the iPhone when working at peak performance.\n\n*It is iOS doing the throttling, although it is doing this based on it's own assessment of the physical limitations of the battery.\n\n\nLong answer\nThere are times when a device (such as an iPhone) will need a sudden burst (or peak) of power to perform a certain task. \nWhen this happens the power source has to be able to deliver the amount of current required by the device, but in the case of ageing batteries1, they often cannot meet this demand. If this happens, an iPhone may suddenly shutdown in order to protect itself from damage (this is similar to how the System Management Controller (SMC) of a Mac computer can kick in to protect your Mac from damage under certain scenarios).\nWhat Apple was trying to do was deal with this issue by having iOS determine when a battery was no longer at a stage that it could meet a certain level of peak current. After iOS makes this determination, it slows down the iPhone so that it's running below its actual capacity. \nFor example, by running the CPU slower it's limiting the power drawn from the battery. This in turn reduces the amount of power required and therefore prevents a situation in which the iPhone randomly shuts down on users. \nApple took this approach in late 2016 after having received numerous reports from users of their iPhones randomly shutting down. Once they determined that the cause in most situations was an ageing battery, they included this 'feature' in iOS when it released the iOS 10.2.1 update.\n1 Strictly speaking, a random shutdown could also occur when an iPhone is being used in cold conditions or when a perfectly good battery is quite low on charge. However, in the great majority of cases this issue arose because of ageing batteries.\n", "Q: Data transfered from old iPad to a new iPad and iPhone; will a reset of the old iPad, wipe the data from the new devices? Will factory reset of my old iPad2 remove my transferred data from the new iPad and iPhone? Everything's on the same account. Do I have to unsynch first?\n\nA: If you factory reset your iPad, you won't wipe the data from your other devices.\nTo give you some perspective, it would be counter intuitive if you lost your phone and remotely wiped your device only to have all your other devices wiped as well.\nThat being said.... don't have the expectation that your other devices are back ups of your data.

So I want to buy a gaming mouse.\nBut one thing I am worried about is how to do Swipe between full-screen apps in a gaming mouse.\nDoes anyone have an idea?\n\nA: The first thing to know about this \"swipe between full-screen apps\" is that in terms of functionality, this is exactly the same as changing a Space (A little more on mission control and spaces here). Fullscreen space is just a type of space that contains just one window/application.\nSome mouse software may have a built-in \"action\" that might be called \"Move left a space\" or \"Move right space\", but that is not guaranteed. However, pretty much any mouse software lets you set shortcuts to all or some of the buttons that trigger certain actions. Luckily, in this case, there are native shortcuts in Mac to go change spaces:\n\n*\n\n*You can move left one space with the shortcut Ctrl + Arrow Left.\n\n*You can move right one space with the shortcut Ctrl + Arrow Right.\n\n\nAt the bottom of this answer I wrote where these can be changed or enabled if necessary. You can also go directly to a specific space. It's the Switch to Desktop... in the screenshot at the bottom.\n\nHow you can trigger these shortcuts (or actions) will depend on the mouse and its software. Many mice, especially gaming mice, have a Mac software even if they are not advertised as Mac mice. So if the mouse software can set shortcuts, then you're all set. There's nothing I can say about how that works exactly without knowing which software your mouse would use, but typically those are fairly simple: Pick a button and remap it to a shortcut that changes the space.\n\n3rd party applications may allow you to change any key, while manufacturer applications may only allow you to customize a few.\n\nIf for some weird reason your gaming mouse doesn't come with software capable of adding a shortcut to a key or it's just terrible, there are still many 3rd party applications that can do it.\nHere are two 3rd party apps that you could try:\n\n*\n\n*SteerMouse\n\n*BetterTouchTool\n\nI'm pretty sure both of these have their own built-in \"Move right and left a space\" actions you can remap to buttons, but like I said before, It's not necessary because as long as the application can make the button trigger a shortcut you should be all set.\n\n\nAdditionally, there is the \"Mission Control\" shortcut, which is by default in the F3 key in your keyboard. When you click it, you can pick a specific space from the top of the screen using your mouse. If that works in games, which I think it might, it might be the best way to do it.\n\nYou can change the native shortcuts in:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n\n*Keyboard\n\n\n*Shortcuts (top)\n\n\n*Mission Control (left panel)\n\n\n*Move left a space / Move Right a space (right panel)\n\n\nA: I made Mac Mouse Fix.\nIt lets you use Click and Drag to move between spaces among other stuff.\nIt's also 100% free, light on system resources, easy-to-use, and fully open source.\nDownload | GitHub\n\nA: I too use a steelseries mouse while gaming as the Magic Mouse sometimes cannot perform actions inside the game (e.g.: clicking middle mouse button).\nYes you can swipe between apps while using an ordinary mouse as well by pressing Ctrl+Arrow Key (Left or Right).

I'm on MacOS High Sierra Version 10.13.2 and use Time Machine to back up to an external drive through an AirPort Extreme.\nI've had this setup for years (~5, I think) and backups worked fine until earlier this year. The .sparsebundle file has a Date Modified of Apr 30, 2017... I don't know whether it broke after an OS update, or anything like that. When attempting a backup, I first get the following message:\n\nTime Machine completed a verification of your backups on “Chris' AirPort Extreme”. To improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you.\n\nand I click \"Start New Backup\". Shortly after, I get the following error:\n\nTime Machine couldn’t complete the backup to “Chris' AirPort Extreme”.\n  Time Machine could not delete the backup disk image “/Volumes/FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0-3/Chris’s MacBook Pro.sparsebundle”.\n\nI've bolded \"0-3\" because, the thing is, the name of my drive as connected through the airport is \"FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0\" -- I have no idea why the plist file has \"-3\" in the path.\nI had a go of editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist to change the \"0-3\" to just \"0\" (I did this by turning off automatic backups in Time Machine preferences, using plutil to convert the plist to xml1, edited in TextEdit, then converted back to binary1); however, when I turn backups back on and tell Time Machine to Back Up Now, it just overwrites the plist to include the \"0-3\" again.\nSame goes for when I delete this plist, entirely -- a new plist is created with \"0-3\". Any ideas?\nUPDATE: Before posting this, I tried a tip I found which advised to repeatedly delete the plist then restart until the plist stays deleted — this never happened (a com.apple.TimeMachine.plist file has always been present after restarting) but the “0-3” has changed to “0-2”.\n\nA: You probably have some folders in your /Volumes folder that're conflicting with the Time Machine volume. You'll need to delete them, then find out what's creating them and get it to stop.\nDeleting them: First, make sure the backup volume (FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0) is not mounted; if it is mounted, eject it. Then in the Finder, choose Go menu > \"Go to Folder\" (or use the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-G). In the \"Go to the folder\" dialog, enter \"/Volumes\" and click Go. This takes you to the normally-hidden /Volumes folder, which is where the various volumes your Mac has mounted (both local and network volumes).\nIf I'm right about the problem, you'll see folders named \"FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0\", \"FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0-1\", and \"FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0-2\" inside /Volumes. You need to delete these, but first check out their contents to make sure there's nothing important in them, and also just to see what files exist -- that'll be a hint about what's creating these folders. When you're done checking them out, delete them. Note that it's not necessary to empty the trash, just to put them in the trash.\nOk, now an explanation of what I think is going on: when your Mac goes to mount the server volume, it tries to create an entry for it in /Volumes, named with the volume's name. All good so far, but what happens if some program tries to access a file or folder on that volume when it isn't mounted? Well, most programs access files by their paths, so the program will try to use /Volumes/FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0/SomeFolderOrFile, and if that doesn't exist many programs will go ahead and create it, and store files in it. Then later you mount the actual server volume, and it can't put it at /Volumes/FreeAgent 3TB GoFlex Drive 0 because there's already something by that name. What it does is append \"-1\" to the name, and use that instead (unless there's something by that name, in which case it tries \"-2\", etc).\nThis creation of spurious folders has apparently happened three times on your system. Deleting the folders will fix it temporarily, but whatever created those folders is probably going to do it again and again unless you track it down and get it to stop. This is where you have to play detective: what files and folders got created inside those spurious folders, and what program uses them? For that matter, what program (other than Time Machine) is using that network volume? My guess would be that it's something that starts using the volume while Time Machine has it mounted, and then tries to continue using it after Time Machine has dismounted it.\n(Time Machine itself shouldn't cause this problem. It uses aliases rather than just paths to locate its backups, and aliases let it be much smarter about e.g. mounting the server volume rather than just creating a folder by its name.)\n", "Q: Using WPS with Airport Utility for other then adding Printers If you open the Airport Utility on you Mac, there is a option Add WPS Printer.\nSince Apple explicitly named it Add WPS Printer..., can you use this for other devices then Printers?\n\nA: Yes, you can!\nI tested this with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Airport Utility v6.3.8 (on macOS 10.13.2)\n\n*With a Airport Extreme 802.11ac\nDevices Tested & Working\n\n\n*\n\n*TV Sony Bravia (via First Attempt)\n\n*TV LG WebOS v3.5 (via PIN)\n\n*Printer Brother MFC9320CW (via PIN)\n\n\nAlthough I'm not sure if it works with everything, I'm fairly positive it will work for many other devices that support WPS.\n", "Q: Command in MS Word on Mac to resize whole text A nice feature of TextEdit on a Mac is the Command+ or Command- shortcut which makes a selected piece of text grow\nor shrink, respecting the ratios between the different parts of the text (thus, if a heading’s font size is twice that of a paragraph, this 2:1 ratio is preserved by Command+ or Command-).\nI have been unable to find an equivalent in the MS Word 2011  on my Mac 10.11.6.

Whenever I tap on GET as per the above screenshot, I get an error stating: \n\nYour request cannot be processed. Error code: 1009.\n\n\nA: Error 1009 appears when Apple sees the phone's IP address as coming from a location or country where the Apple Store (or this particular app) is blocked. Your phone's screenshot shows connectivity through Cubacel, so I presume you're in Cuba...and I'll bet Apple blocks the download for that reason. You could consider using a VPN (virtual private network) to anonymize your location, which might allow the download...and which might also contravene Cuban law.\n", "Q: A question about installing kernels (related to running Hydrogen with Atom) I have a really basic question, but the more I read, the more confused I get: How do I install pip so I can install kernels?\nThis question came about when I tried to install the Hydrogen package to use in Atom, the text editor (to help me learn Python). I finally succeeded in installing Hydrogen, but got stumped by the missing kernels (not sure which ones I need, so I am willing to install them all). But I can't seem to install the kernels without pip. \nI have a vague understanding of the implications of global vs local installations--I get that certain Python installations aren't compatible with local or global kernel installations (I hope I have the terminology right.) But I saw several warnings about installing pip for \"a homebrew based python installation\", but I am not sure whether Python on my laptop is installed via homebrew (nor how to find out).\nSo if Python(2.7) came pre-installed on my MacBook Pro (High Sierra), can I just do sudo easy_install pip (as suggested) from the command line--withOUT causing issues?\nI first posted this question in StackExchange and was advised to seek help here. Frankly I wasn't sure whether this was a Mac question or a Atom question.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I had the same problem. I solved it by making the first line of my script:\n#!path/to/python\n\nI type which python and use the result in first line of script. Now Hydrogen works every time.\n\nA: I solved the problem of installing pip-but it is NOT a perfect solution because I discovered Hydrogen sometimes kicks in and sometimes not--this relates to my initial concern about global/local installations. But here's how I installed pip; perhaps others can help resolve the rest.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Python 3 (from python.org).\n\n*Follow instructions to get 'get-pip.py' (https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line). (This was done from the terminal)\n\n*In Atom, cmd+shift+p to bring up the packages menu; click on 'Hydrogen Run'. When the errors message pops up,copy the code from the error warnings, go back to the terminal, and install the kernels needed (via the command line).\n\n*At this point, Hydrogen is now working.\n\n*BUT: in Atom, sometimes Hydrogen works, sometimes it doesn't. So it's not stable.\n\n", "Q: Will Time Machine backup a RAID 1 Drive Will Time Machine backup a RAID 1 Drive.  Will you get single copy of data or is each mirrored drive backed up?\n\nA: Short: one set of files is backed up.\nLong: you can think of the storage system as layered.  At the bottom is a layer of disk partitions representing disks;  see /dev - as in\nls -l /dev/disk\nor\nfile /dev/disk\nAt the next layer up, these partitions can be used directly (no RAID) or grouped using RAID.  At the next layer up, the (non-)RAIDed partitions can be used for a filesystem;  see /Volumes - as in\nls -l /Volumes \nYou can see the mapping of disks and filesystems using the mount command (no arguments - repeat - supply no arguments to the command):\nmount\nTime Machine works at the filesystem level and backs up files and directories; Time Machine does not see the (non-)RAID or partition levels.  Another way to think about it - Time Machine sees file names and attributes (read, write, owner, group, etc.), and those attributes and names do not exist at the RAID level.\n\nA: Time Machine backs up on file system level, so it doesn’t matter whether your file system is on a simple volume or a RAID configuration, all it backups are files and folders. This also means that you can restore a TM backup to a RAID configuration if required. \n", "Q: Partition Type : FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF I know this has been asked on here before, and similarly to the others I have not backed up my data...

On the original boot drive (disk0) Yosemite is installed. On the second \"broken\" drive (diisk1) an APFS partition was detected with the sudo dd if=/dev/disk1s2 count=3 | hexdump method from the linked answer.\nAfter removing the second partition on drive1 with sudo gpt remove -i 2 disk1 the MBR blocked adding the partition with the proper type.

Often 3rd party kernel extensions (aka Kexts) are the cause of problems on macOS systems. One tell-tale sign is a system that boots okay in Safe Mode and doesn't reproduce the problems a user may be experiencing when booted normally. While this doesn't guarantee the problem is a 3rd party kernel extension, it's certainly one of the more likely causes.\nHow does a user identify what 3rd part kernel extensions are installed on their Mac?\n\nA: You can identify 3rd party kernel extensions (Kexts) via Terminal.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Terminal app (found within your Applications > Utilites folder)\n\n*Type (or copy and paste) the following command:\n\n\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\n\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Within moments Terminal will list all 3rd party kernel extensions (Note: you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). \n\n\nIf you’re having issues with your Mac, you can use the above process to identify any 3rd party extensions you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you no longer use. \nPlease note that this is a list of all 3rd party kernel extensions and any of them could be causing the problem.\n", "Q: Bootcamp: no bootable device – insert boot disk and press any key I installed Windows 7 on my 2011 MacBook Pro (MacOS High Sierra) successfully.

The right (or is it wrong) combination of commands causes eraser of the values stored in the Master Boot Record (MBR) table. Windows 7 uses these values to determine the partitioning of the drive. Fortunately, these values are duplicated in the GUID partition table (GPT). Unfortunately, you will have to preform the tedious task of reentering the missing values. \nUnless you disable System Integrity Protection (SIP), the solutions given below requires booting to macOS Recovery via the internet, built-in recovery or an USB flash drive macOS installer. Once booted to macOS Recovery, open a Terminal application window.\n\nNote: The Terminal application can be found under \"Utilities\" on the menu bar.\n\nSolution without Using Third Party Tools\nThe answer given below is based on my answer to the question How to convert a drive from the GPT format to the hybrid GPT/MBR format when using High Sierra (macOS 10.13.2). You should read this question and answer before proceeding.\nThe command given below can be used to partially display the information contained in GUID partition table (GPT) stored on disk0. You will need this information when editing the Master Boot Record (MBR) table. \ngpt -r show /dev/disk0 \n\nHere are the steps involving in editing the MBR table to create a hybrid partitioning scheme. You will be preforming the same steps as given in this answer, except for the changes given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*The interactive command to edit the MBR partition table is given below. All changes will be not be entered in CHS mode.\nfdisk -e /dev/disk0\n\nEntering this command produced the following output\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nEnter 'help' for information\nfdisk: 1> \n\n\nNote: The control+C key can be pressed at anytime to terminate the fdisk command without saving any changes. \n\n\n*The only entry, in the initial MBR table, defines a \"Protective Partition\". This partition needs to be truncated to the end of the first partition in the GPT with the GUID of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B. This means the start value should remain 1, but the size value should be reduced to the value start + size - 1. The values use in this equation should be taken from GPT. The computed value usually is 409639.\nBelow are the correct values to enter into fdisk for the first partition of the MBR table. Replace <start + size - 1 of GPT partition with index=1> with the computed integer value. \nedit 1\nEE\nN\n1\n<start + size - 1 of GPT partition with index=1>\n\n\n*Next, enter the correct values for second partition of the MBR table. The command is edit and the id is AC. The start and size values are the same as shown in the GPT. Doing so, results in what is shown below.\nedit 2\nAC\nN\n<start of GPT partition with index=2>\n<size of GPT partition with index=2>\n\n\n*Repeat the previous step to update MBR table partitions 3 and 4. This is shown below. The id for partition 3 is AB and for partition 4 is 07.\nedit 3\nAB\nN\n<start of GPT partition with index=3>\n<size of GPT partition with index=3>\nedit 4\n07\nN\n<start of partition with index=4>\n<size of partition with index=4>\n\n\n*The next command flags the fourth MBR partition as bootable. This partition was chosen because this is where the Windows resides. \nflag 4\n\n\n*The next command to enter is print. This command displays what the updated MBR table would look like. You can use the output to verify your changes.\n\nNote: The descriptions such as <Unknown ID>, Xenix BBT and HPFS/QNX/AUX are either wrong and/or outdated. Also, the cyl, hd and sec values are no longer used by macOS or Windows so you can ignore these values. \n\n\n*The final command quit writes the table back to the MBR, then quit fdisk. This is shown below.\nfdisk:*1> quit\nWriting current MBR to disk.\nDevice could not be accessed exclusively.\nA reboot will be needed for changes to take effect. OK? [n] Y\n\nAs the above message suggests, it would be a good idea to restart the Mac.\nSolution Using a Third Party Tool\nThe command gdisk is a third party tool that can be used to avoid having to manually enter the partition values from the GPT. You can download gdisk from this SourceForge website. Once booted to macOS Recovery, you would need to enter the command given below.\n/Volumes/HARDISK/usr/local/bin/gdisk  /dev/disk0\n\n\nNote: I assume the name of your macOS boot volume is HARDDISK.

Is there something you can do about this? This person is definitely not in my family or anyone that I know.\n\nA: Contact apple support immediately.

Maybe consider two factor authentication as well (if not already enabled).\n", "Q: How can I disable a USB port that is drawing too much power? One of my USB ports is being constantly disabled by my OS because it is drawing too much power, without a device attached. Is there any way to permanently disable the port?\n\nA: Short answer is no, you can't disable a USB port.  Additionally, if you are having this issue with nothing attached to it, it's definitely a hardware issue.\nFirst thing is to do an SMC reset. \nIf that doesn't fix the issue, you need to take it in for service because it's likely a logic board or component (connector issue).  If I had to guess, it would be a short to ground of the 5V power rail on the USB connector.  However, without actually getting hands on with it, it's only a hypothesis at best.\n", "Q: Behavior of hard-coded date in AppleScript I am designing an AppleScript which contains a hard-coded date to which the script refers multiple times throughout the duration of the execution.\nAn example is as follows:\nproperty someDate : date \"Monday, 1 January 2018 at 01:00:00 PM\"\n\nAs one can see, the format of the timestamp is appropriate for my region and country. Another example would be: Saturday, April 15, 2006 4:29:04 PM or 12/25/04 - which is the format for other regions such as the US - mm/dd/yy.\nThe following questions arise \n\n\n*\n\n*If my AppleScript will be run in other regions/countries\n(those with different timestamp formats eg. mm/dd/yy instead of my \ndd/mm/yy), how does AppleScript behave with the above declaration?\n\n*How should I ensure that AppleScript will correctly convert the timestamp from my format into the respective format used by the end user's device?\n\n\nThe proper conversion becomes critical if the format of the date changes to the previously mentioned dd/mm/yy and is then used in a mm/dd/yy environment (region or country). In that case, the order may not be apparent.  \nExample Case \nproperty someDate : date \"02/01/18\" as dd/mm/yy would be hard-coded with the intention of representing 02 January 2018, but when used in a different region (those using mm/dd/yy); naturally, this will become 01 February 2018. See the issue?\nAs my research into this leads nowhere fast (and should be specific to AppleScript), I hope somebody who has implemented similar code could assist me in clarifying the two points above.

The issue is that I have a Mac Mini running High Sierra and it will stop publishing its shares to my network after between an hour and four hours (I haven't nailed this down exactly) and every one of my Mac's, regardless of OS version, will be unable to access the shares anymore.  If I try to connect to that system in any way from any computer it just tries for a few minutes and tells me it is unavailable.  One interesting additional issue is that when the computer stops publishing shares I can also no longer access the sharing preference pane, always getting the message \"Preferences Error - Could not load Sharing preference pane\".\nThis has happened before with much less regularity back when I had upgraded my \"server\" to El Capitan but it seemed to settle down eventually.\nCoincidentally when this computer is in this \"state\" I can no longer shut down or restart, I have to physically power off the system to reboot it and get it to publish shares for another few hours or I can go to terminal and issue a sudo shutdown -r now and that will reboot it.\nThis may be unrelated but when this happens there is also a process i see in Activity Monitor that reports that \"Login window\" is not responding\" which cannot be quit or force quit from Activity Monitor but can kill manually with a sudo kill in terminal (but killing  this and then it auto starting again doesn't fix the problem).\nBefore I erase what is my server (so thus a major issue to totally blow it away and start again) I wanted to see if anyone had some ideas.  I have booted into safe mode and gone into sharing and then shut down and I have reset the PRAM on the computer.\nToday I watched Console as I tried to access the now-locked-up Sharing Preferences and did notice this message (not sure if this is relevant or not): \n\nERROR: _willSelectSemaphore timeout! (com.apple.preferences.sharing)\n\nUpdate: Today I've been really logging everything and watching the system constantly and found that if I kill SMB and restart it then everything works again, including unlocking the sharing pane. I use: sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist and sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\nSo it appears to be an SMB issue and I'm not sure what I can do to resolve it.  I did add a PLIST script to 'touch' the SMB process but have to wait that out to see if it does any good because it was actually a Mavericks fix that touching SMB would force it to restart.  I put it in Library/LaunchDaemon.\n\nA: We are having the same issues since the last Server update, which deprecated file sharing, and relegates it to OS X (we have a mini). Besides the issues you are experiencing, it seems like we went back years in compatibility since High Sierra. \nAll of our workstations are Windows 10. When we updated to 10.13, the first issue was anytime opening an AutoCAD file, all MS Excel links required us to acknowledge read-only, which hasn't been an issue in at least a couple years (but it's back). Then when we went to 10.13.2 and the corresponding server app, we had all the problems you mentioned. Additionally, our Windows workstations are slowing to a crawl. Issuing a save command from any application takes at least 5 sec in any application. Windows explorer (desktop and file explorer) crashes when it needs to copy/overwrite a file from the workstation to the server. It actually seems like it's getting worse each day.\nAnyway, we've been doing this dance with Apple for 10 years and I don't think they are going to do anything. We just ordered a Synology DS918+ NAS to take over file sharing. I'll keep the mac mini server running Website and Mail until they are deprecated in the next OS X Server \"update\".\n", "Q: Missing /usr/local/sbin directory in the /etc/paths file Why doesn’t the /etc/paths file include the /usr/local/sbin directory on macOS?\n$ cat /etc/paths\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nI would have expected:\n$ cat /etc/paths\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nNote. — The /etc/paths file is read by the /etc/profile shell script to generate the PATH environment variable.\n\nA: The /usr/local/sbin directory does not exist on a default macOS installation, but you can easily add it yourself.\nTo add that directory to the system-wide PATH environment variable (for all users), as there is always the risk of a macOS update overwriting /etc/paths, it might be better to add a file named usr_local_sbin (or anything else) to /etc/paths.d with that single line:\n/usr/local/sbin\n\nThis will put the /usr/local/sbin path in a position close to the end of PATH, which usually (assuming unique command names) is not a problem. If you want to have it early in PATH for whatever reason, either add to  /etc/paths nevertheless or edit the PATH order in the user-specific ~/.profile.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro keyboard and Trackpad not working. All solutions found have failed I have a 13-inch early 2015 Macbook Pro with Retina display, and today the keyboard and trackpad stopped working completely. (I have OS X 10.11.5 if that's relevant. I can't update to sierra, as a software I use is not compatible with it). The only thing that works is the power button. Now, this isn't unprecedented. This started happening a few weeks ago, but every time it happened, shutting down and restarting by holding the power button fixed the issue. But today it didn't.\nI know there are many questions like this, but I tried every single solution I found. This probably means I won't get one here either, but I want to try this before I have to go to the Apple store.\nI plugged in a USB keyboard to my laptop so that I could use it. I also plugged in a USB mouse, but that mouse plugs into the keyboard, not into the computer. Both worked fine. I tried an SMC reset and a PRAM reset, using both the built-in keyboard and the external keyboard for the required inputs, for a total of 4 attempted resets. I can't really tell if they did what they were supposed to or not, but they didn't fix my keyboard.\nI booted in safe mode (using the shift key on the external keyboard. Using the one on my laptop didn't work, and it just booted normally), and the issue persisted.\nThe other solution I saw was to disable FileVault, but it was already disabled prior to this incident.\nI also saw people saying plugging in a USB drive during login fixed the issue, but this didn't work either.\nThe last solution I tried was to let the computer sit while powered off and not connected to the battery. This didn't do anything either.\nI did not spill anything on my computer prior to this incident, so I have no idea why it started happening. If anyone has solutions for this that I haven't tried yet, please let me know.\nEDIT: I just noticed that if my computer is asleep, clicking the built in trackpad wakes it up. However, the trackpad doesn't do anything else.\n\nA: You need to replace your top case assembly.\nYour keyboard and trackpad (built in) are USB devices, so when you plugged in your external mouse/keyboard and everything worked, you effectively ruled out software issues.  This is also confirmed when trying to boot in Safe Mode or doing NVRAM/SMC resets via the built in keyboard.  \nIf it doesn't work in a pre-boot environment, it's not going to work at all.\nThe only option left is replacement of the top case assembly itself (Apple PN# 661-02361)  and given that both have failed, it's highly likely that the USB interface on the keyboard has died.\nTechnically speaking, you could replace just your keyboard and trackpad, but it's an extremely labor intensive proposition.  Whether you are replacing the keyboard/trackpad or the assembly itself, it will require a complete disassembly of the MacBook innards.  iFixit.com has a writeup on the procedure and they rank it as \"Difficult\" with an allocation of 3 hours time. \nEven if you don't plan on undertaking that repair yourself, I do suggest you familiarize yourself with the procedure to understand what's actually involved.  Suffice to say, it will be an expensive repair. \n\nA: I fixed it by just pressing the strip holding the battery. NVRAM/SMC reset didn't work. \nBut, the fix was only temporary. It occurred again and I think it's probably because of the battery swollen issue. \n\nA: We ran into this problem, apparently it is a very common problem of the MacBook Pro 2015 as a series.\nIt's caused by a hardware problem, there is a cable between the touchpad and the motherboard that needs to be replaced.\nWe contacted some local experts and they fixed it in 2 hours.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with an early 2014 Macbook Air. Did all the SW \"fixes\" listed on the web including re-installing/upgrading OS with no luck. Discovered that the keyboard/trackpad worked in recovery mode after boot but not in OS - implying a SW not HW issue. This observation proved incorrect. In the end, I replaced the trackpad ribbon cable in the laptop ($8 on Amazon) using Pentalobe, Torx drivers ($7 on Amazon). I opened the case and inspected the ribbon cable. There didn't appear to be any damage to the connectors but I replaced cable anyway (reference youtube videos). After reboot, keyboard and trackpad are working perfectly.  Total cost of repair was < $20 for parts/tools.\nIt seems the ribbon cable is a delicate item in these machines. My only regret was not replacing the cable sooner.\n", "Q: Weird Mac Application Behaviour I have been suffering from some weird issues on my MacBook Pro after periods of usage.\nThese are a few of the problems which occur once the problem starts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Software starts behaving weird/stops working correctly\n\n*The Mac will sometimes say it can't start the software\n\n*Messages semi logs out, it receives messages but doesn't let you send them. \n\n\nAll issues resolve with a restart.\nI previously faced an issue with the Mac crashing, except the cursor.

So my main laptop is a MacBook which runs on a Samsung 850 evo ssd, has 2 partitions- one runs El Capitan and other is formatted as exfat.\nMy questions is - how can I use this very ssd to run Windows 10 on my other (HP) laptop off the exfat partition?\nSituation as of now - I have a bootable usb of Windows 10 but it asks for a cd disk, and I can't seem to find a way to use the usb.\nWhat I fear is that by using a recovery cd to install Windows, the program might overwrite over all my existing data. What I want is to just install Windows on the exfat partition\nI understand that unlike Mac, Windows has to be installed separately for each and every computer, I can't use some other laptops ssd to boot this laptop.\nAny help or comments are appreciated. Thank you!\nEdit: Im gonna use the ssd as an internal ssd on the HP laptop,  not as an external with an enclosure. Its my fathers old work laptop and i have standing instructions to not to edit anything on it (but the damn thing is  running windows 7), since there will come a day when he'll have to return it. This is why i wanna 'preserve' the partition with el capitan. I will not be connecting-disconnecting it again and again. Jist twice. I have since formatted the partition in NTFS.\n**so my ultimate question is this : I have a drive with two partitions,  I want to install windows 10 on just one while the other partition remains untouched. Since its too messy to install windows on 1 device and then port it to other,  I have inserted the ssd in the new laptop.  How do I move forward with the installation? **\n\nA: I think this might be a better fit for Super User as it's mainly about PC/Windows rather than Mac. \nHowever, as a rough guide -\nyou'd do far better to clone the Mac's boot & recovery partitions to a spare drive using something like Carbon Copy Cloner then let the Windows installer [from a PC] just break the whole darn thing - which it will, it will insist on NTFS & will probably set up its own EFI & recovery partitions; and Windows won't boot easily if it's not at the beginning - then use the Mac to restore the 2 Mac partitions afterwards to the end of the disk.  This will likely need 3rd Party software, such as Paragon Hard Disk Manager \nWindows also is not truly portable like macOS, so each time you move it to a different machine it will either crash/fail or require re-authorisation from Microsoft. Windows is also not too keen on booting from a removable drive.\nUltimately, I think buying a second SSD would be simplest & safest.\n\nA: First, Windows does not run on ExFAT; Windows requires NTFS.\nSecondly, this is a bad idea all around.  The SATA cables/connectors are not designed to be a device that can be connected/disconnected repeatedly.  \nYou could potentially damage the connectors on your drive, damage the cable itself (where applicable) or worse, the connectors on the logic board.

Since you have to reassemble it, do it completely because one of two things will happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*it will work which means you don't want to disassemble it again to connect the remaining components.\n\n*it won't work in which case you must disassemble it again to return it to the seller.\nTaking shortcuts in this type of work always leads to a more expensive fix than you originally hoped/planned for.\n", "Q: Ulysses on macOS - share local content between user accounts [without iCloud] Does anybody know how to share local Ulysses content across Mac user accounts?\nI can see the local content is not stored at a user-specific directory:\n~/Library/Containers/com.soulmen.ulysses3\nI have a Admin account and a Standard account.

The image is resized to 100% of the browser window width. In all other browsers the transparent parts behave normal – but safari shows a thin outline whee the image should be transparent. \nI hope the screenshot makes the problem clear:\n\nNow I'm wondering if this is this a bug – or a feature? And of course I would like to get rid of that zigzag line – so any suggestions and pointers are welcome. Thank you!\nEDIT:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, I checked if the image has a grey line – but it does not. \n\n*Also this problem anly appeared after I updated Safari to 11.0.2. \n\n*And when modifying the img's width in dev tools first to the actual width (7000px) and then back to 100% the grey line disappears.\n\n*Here is a link to the website where the problem appears. \n\n\nA: I just faced the same issue and stumbled upon this question.\nFor me, the image showed a thin, medium-dark, shadowy border at the edge between the non-transparent and the transparent part of the image.\nThe issue was only visible in Safari.\n\nFor me, the solution was to simple add transform: translateZ(0px) to the image. This changes the rendering of the image in a way that prevents the border.\n\nHowever, you might want to restrict this fix to Safari since it causes the image to be rendered pixelated in Chrome.\n", "Q: Folder action to append to Spotlight comment for files in Finder I am using AppleScript and Python together to gather system information about the Macs in my stock as well as adding some supplemental info to the Spotlight comments field. \nSpecifically, AppleScript gathers the info on the Mac whose details I am capturing (whilst booted up to an external USB drive). I use dialogue boxes etc to gather feedback about OS version to be installed, the order number as well as the machine's actual marketing name (thanks to https://github.com/MagerValp/MacModelShelf), these are all saved as comments in the final System Profiler *.spx file that is generated/saved by the script.  \nI then use Dropbox to send the file back to my main Mac (which is running Filemaker). I use a rather complicated Python script to read the XML data of the system profiler file and to then paste the critical hardware info such as serial numbers, HD size and type etc into the relevant fields of the database. \nI would like to parse the Spotlight comments of the spx file to get at the addition info e.g marketing name, Model Name and Order Number. \nI try using (in Python script)\nspotlightComments = 'mdls -raw -name kMDItemFinderComment ' + str(file_path)\n\nto parse the comments. Even in Terminal as a standalone command this returns just a blank line, despite the comments being visible when I right click the spx file and go to 'Get Info'. N.B this is different from the \"(null)\" I used to get when using other Cloud services such as Sync.com which don't appear to carry-over file meta-data such as Spotlight comments. \nIf I open the edit the file's Spotlight comments and add just a single space \" \" character at the end of the string the command works - i.e I get back something like\niMac Late 2012 | 300001234 | 10.12\n\nThis can be further split up with the Python command\nparts = spotlightComments.split('|')\n\nAnyway back to AppleScript! \nI've tried making a folder action to automatically append a single space/\" \" character to the end of a file's comments the moment something is added to the folder containing it, but nothing at all appears to happen. \nHere is my script...\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items\n\n    repeat with currentFile in added_items\n\n        set TheComment to the comment of the currentFile\n\n        set comment of the currentFile to TheComment & \" \"\n\n    end repeat\n\nend adding folder items to\n\nEven when I swap out the appended string to be something far more obvious there is still no change.

I am backing up documents, pics, and videos to an external HD that is formatted in exFAT.  I use my MBA and a Lenovo system interchangibly and need files accessible on both, hence exFAT.  I noticed size and size on disk in Lenovo to be tremendously different (400 GB takes up 800 GB space for example).  \nIn trying to figure out what was happening, I came across an unusual file system block size on my MacBook, at least as far as I am reading it. \nI followed the steps shown on this page What are the sector sizes on Mac OS X?.\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\nApparently the 4096 expected file size is 4194304 instead while the Device Block Size and Allocation Block Size are both 4096.\nCould you tell me if I'm reading it correctly, that 4194304 is extremely large?  If so, how do I fix it?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: No, that is not extremely large. The command \"stat -f %k .\" does not as such give you the block size on disk, but rather it is a guide from the OS to user programs as to how large amounts of data at a time it should transfer to/from disk for optimal performance.\nWith modern SSDs it is not uncommon for that value to be 4 MB as you indicate, instead of the 4 kB that was a kind of \"default value\" for many years, and not really observed by user space programs anyway.\n", "Q: Add images to a contact in Contacts Is there a way to modify the type style and add JPEGs or PNGs to Contacts?\n\nA: The only media which can be added to a contact is as a profile photo.

Rotation: 90 degrees. Scale: 1920x1080 (standard).\n\n*28\" via USB-C to DisplayPort 1.2. Rotation: Standard/None. Scale 2560x1440 (scaled down).\n\n\nI am not sure if the rotation or something else is the issue here but my macbook fan seems to be very loud constantly. The rotation is being done on the GPU right? I sometimes use the screen on the macbook as well, this only makes matters worse and the fan gets loud. Strangely, my less powerful macbook (not pro) 13\" 2015/2016 edition handles this setup just fine.\nAnyone else have any clues as to what is going on here?\n\nA: I would suggest you download 'Temperature Gauge 4.1' to see if fans are running at high rpm or if they are just noisy. Noisy fans could be a sign of trouble. This app will also show you the temperature of various parts of your Mac. This app is not cheap at $18. And is available here\n\nA: What makes you think the issue is with the screens? Does the issue persist when they are not connected or not rotated?\nEither way, here are some things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Activity Monitor, sort processes by CPU. Are there any processes there hogging the CPU? This can often cause the system to heat up even if not running at 100%. Sometimes it can be the last thing you expect. A corrupt bookmarks file in Safari gave me similar problems with heat from Safari stuck trying to read it. \n\n*Make sure some 3rd party program isnt causing problems. Try booting into safe mode and see if the problem persists. Instructions for that are here. \n\n*Check your hardware set up. I have always found the free version of Macs Fan Control to be more than enough to diagnose a hot component. It also gives you an option to view the fan speed. Perhaps a fan is blocked and being noisy.\n", "Q: Colors are different when SSHing onto a Linux machine from iTerm2. How can I standardize them? Currently, when I SSH onto a Linux machine, the ls output colors and syntax coloring in VIM are different from the colors on my local machine. The colors shown are not defined in my Profile...Colors...ANSI Colors, and include an ugly dark brown color for \"yellow.\"\nHow can I force the text from a remote session to match my ANSI colors, so the coloring is always consistent?\nHere's an example of what I'm talking about: left is VIM session on my local computer, right is VIM session within an SSH session. Notice the hideous brown.\n\nAnd here's an example of the ls problem -- the colors are different.\n\n\nA: I found the answer to the \"ls colors are different\" problem. You just need to make sure ls coloring is enabled on both machines, then use this page to make the colors encoded in the local (Mac) LSCOLORS variable identical to the colors encoded in the remote (Linux) LS_COLORS variable.\nFor Linux ls coloring matching the macOS defaults: put this in your .bashrc on your Mac:\nalias ls=\"ls -G\"\nexport LSCOLORS=\"exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad\"\n\nAnd put this in your .bashrc on the Linux machine:\nalias ls=\"ls --color=always\"\nexport LS_COLORS=\"di=34:ln=35:so=32:pi=33:ex=31:bd=34;46:cd=34;43:su=30;41:sg=30;46:tw=30;42:ow=30;43\"\n\n\nEdit: Alternatively (this is what I now do), you can just download \"coreutils\" with homebrew via brew install coreutils, then place alias ls=gls in your .bashrc. gls is the GNU version. Now, you can control ls colors with LS_COLORS, just like on Linux.\nAlso, if you want to get even more fancy: since you are now using the GNU ls, you can control the colors of various file extensions/types/permission levels by creating a ~/.dircolors.ansi file and running gdircolors ~/.dircolors.ansi. This repo has some dircolors templates to get you started.\n\nA: The VIM part of this question was answered here.\nTurns out my local session had background set to dark in VIM, and my remote session had background set to light. I just added the line set background=dark in my .vimrc and the colors now look identical.\n", "Q: Install Sierra on Macbook Pro shipped with High Sierra New MBP purchase shipped with High Sierra. I'd like to downgrade to Sierra but am running into the issue that you can't install a version of the OS lower than what was shipped. The explanation I found is that the drivers don't exist, but I know for a fact that the drivers exist since there is another MBP at my company shipped just a few months prior with the same specs, running Sierra. Is there any way to force this laptop to boot into a bootable Sierra install USB drive so I can perform the downgrade? I can't even get this laptop to boot from a live Linux USB, I just get a giant \"No\" icon. It seems li\nI've tried to sidestep it a few ways, none of which have worked. I'm now thinking of trying to clone the hard drive from the other MBP I have that's running Sierra onto the new one. I wish I knew how Apple was able to perform this restriction. I imagine it's just a piece of information somewhere with a version check, if I could find that file maybe I could lower the minimum version?\nI'm not willing to put High Sierra on my network yet, it doesn't play nice with profile management or Munki. I also really don't like the idea that I've purchased hardware which doesn't allow me to install the software I actually want. I know Apple is \"Big Brother-ish\", but this obnoxious. For what they charge for hardware, I should be able to do whatever I want to this machine.\nMy rant aside, does anyone have any insight on a method to get around this restriction?\nEDIT:\nIn regards to the duplicate flag, I had read all of the referenced articles before posting, but asked this anyway because I wanted to know if it was possible to circumvent the protection. As I said, I find it very difficult to accept that I've purchased a piece of hardware which I won't let me use it the way I want to use it.\n\nA: The well-accepted answer now and since there have been Macs (I believe...) is that whatever OS ships with it is the earliest version of the OS that will go on it.\nSo if it ships with macOS 10.6.8 then there is no way you will ever get anything lower than 10.6.8 on it (not 10.6.7, not anything).\nSo to answer your question specifically, if it came with High Sierra (whatever version) that is the lowest version of macOS it will ever run.\nThere may be hacks around that (and that answer won't be here), but I am not aware of any and I have been supporting Macs since 1990, professionally since 1992.\n\nA: According to the website everymac.com, all 2017 MacBook Pro models were pre-installed with macOS 10.12.5 (Sierra). Just because your Mac came with High Sierra does not mean the firmware will not allow you to download and install Sierra.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try this test:\nRestart your Mac and hold down the Shift+Option+ ⌘(Command)+R. This will allow you boot to macOS Recovery over the internet. Eventually, you should get the image shown below. \n\nSelect, \"Reinstall macOS\", then select the \"Continue\" button. \n\n*If your Mac can install Sierra, then the image below will be displayed.\n\nOtherwise, the image below will be displayed.\n\n\n*On the menu bar, select either \"Install macOS Sierra\" or \"Install macOS High Sierra\", then select \"Quit install macOS\"\n\n*Choose \"Restart\" from the Apple () menu.\n\n\nIf the above steps indicate your Mac supports a Sierra install, you can download Sierra from the Apple website How to download macOS Sierra. If you try to install Sierra, you will probably get the popup window shown below.\n\nIf this case, you can use a USB flash drive to install Sierra. The instructions for creating a USB flash drive installer are given at How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\n\nNote: You can not install to a High Sierra volume without first erasing the volume with the Disk Utility. If you have APFS volumes, you will probably want to erase the entire drive with the Disk Utility or by entering the following commands in a Terminal application window.\n\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  disk 0\ndiskutil  partitionDisk  disk0  1  GPT  JHFS+  \"Macintosh HD\"  R\n\n", "Q: How can I disable the bell icon/emoji from the title bar in iTerm2? I find it annoying and get no use from it. Here's a picture of what I'm talking about:\n\n\nA: The bell is a visual indicator that the terminal bell \"rang\".\nYou can disable it on a profile-by-profile basis in the \"Preferences\" pane.\nMenu: Profiles | Open Profiles | Edit Profiles... | Terminal\nin the \"Notifications\" section uncheck \"Show bell icon in tabs\"\n\nA: This is behavior is controlled via the Show bell icon in tabs preference mentioned earlier, but if changing that setting doesn't appear to do anything, you may have a corrupt preferences file or cache.

I was told that you should never use a non-Apple phone or iPad charger because only Apple is proven to keep you secure from information being stolen while you are plugged in to a large non-residential power supply.\n\nA: Generally no that is not true. However it is possible that bad actors have installed devices in some chargers to do nefarious things. The chances of you actually running across one of these? Probably slim but it depends on what kind of places you try to charge your phone. So no way of telling.\nYou can, however, protect yourself from such attacks by using a charging only USB/Lightning cable. Finding such cables is left up to your clever use of Google.\n", "Q: Is it possible to wirelessly debug iOS app on iPhone? I'm setting up my Xamarin development environment and there are issues with iOS debugging. I'd like to have a way to debug my app on iPhone, but it's not so easy. Here's the ways I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install macOS virtual machine on Windows and connect iPhone physically over USB to Windows host. But it doesn't seem legal to install macOS as virtual machine on non-Apple branded hardware (see https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1000131 and Using Mac in a virtual machine legality?)\n\n*Use Apple hardware. Not a cheap option, and I don't want to migrate to macOS only to debug iOS apps.\n\n*Use cloud Mac, e.g. https://www.macincloud.com. But I haven't found a way for wireless debugging iOS applications. As I see, iPhone must be physically attached to macOS hardware, which is not possible in this case.\n\n\nThe most convinient options would be #3. It would be great to debug iOS app on a real device using Mac in cloud. Is that possible?\n\nA: It is possible to debug iOS apps on an iPhone wirelessly over WiFi, yes. This is a supported way of debugging in Xcode.\nWith Xamarin you can also debug over WiFi if you enable \"Debug over WiFi\" in the \"iOS Debug\" Build settings. However with Xamarin you need to launch the application over the USB cable. So you cannot do a fully wireless setup there.\nDoing wireless debugging with a \"cloud Mac\" would probably require setting up a VPN connection or similar that makes it appear as though the cloud Mac is on your LAN. And it would only work with Xcode - not Xamarin.\nA different approach would be to buy for example the Eltima USB Network Gate. Connect the iPhone to your local PC and use the software to connect that USB port over the network to your \"cloud Mac\" where it would appear as though the iPhone was physically connected. This should (at least in theory) allow you to launch and debug apps using Xamarin.\n\nA: First of all, yes its possible to debug application wirelessly. If you have Xcode 9 or later version then you will be able to do that. \nHere are steps to follow:- \n1 Open Xcode\n2 Choose Window > Devices and Simulators\n3 Click on Device and select your iPhone by connecting with cable to your Mac\n4 In right column you will select “Connect via Network” as shown in below image.\nNote - Your iOS device and Mac should be connected within same network area. \nI got reference from this post\n", "Q: Set up iMessage on iPod touch without erasing all data My dad has been trying to set up iMessage on my sisters iPod touch so my sister can text me.

I can come up with a few advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install programs without going though the process of finding the download link, possible mounting the image, and installing it if contains an installer (although this doesn't save too much time unless you're trying to reinstall many programs on another computer)\n\n*You can uninstall the programs fairly easily\nLooking at the website, they list three advantages: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install with ease – this I mentioned above\n\n*Unix-savvy, macOS-friendly – here it mentions applications are installed in /Applications or any other configured area, which is nice but not a game-changer\n\n*Community-driven – this is mainly useful for enthusiasts or for people who want to make their applications compatible with Homebrew-Cask\n\n\nOther than the two reasons I could come up with, I don't see any other huge advantages. Are there any that I am not aware of? While uninstalling programs using brew cask uninstall, do all the files associated with the app get removed, à la AppCleaner? Is it comparable to AppCleaner?\n\nA: Two other main points are that it makes a) updating and b) transfering your setup to another machine extremely easy.\nThe uninstall capabilities depend on the \"quality\" of the cask for the program you uninstall. There is no \"general\" complete cleanup afaik.\n", "Q: Will the 2017 15\" MBP touchbar work with a Dell U3417W? I need to purchase a new MBP for my boss.

I have resorted to deleting the coworker who receives the messages from my iPhone and laptop contacts, but that doesn't feel like a long-term solution. Firing him does, I'll look into that for sure...\n\nA: At the top of the conversation of the Messages app the contact should be listed under the To: header. You can use the arrow by the name to select more details and change which number you are replying to.\nAs an alternative you could delete their work numbers, or put it in the notes section of the contact to prevent Messages from mixing them up.\nIt's best to delete the conversation and start a new one after making changes like these to make sure that messages is using the proper contact info.\n\nA: I had this exact problem.

issue?\n\nA: From my perspective, this is a bug in Apple's code and you can't do anything about it, other than updating whenever a new version of macOS is released. This instability has surfaced on my stable MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2013 after the upgrade to macOS High Sierra.\nJust make sure you send the crash reports to Apple and some day, somewhere in the future they will fix it (hopefully).\n\nA: From the looks of it, it seems like your MacBook has some sort of conflict with 3D acceleration (accelerator tried to use resource that is currently used). You seem to have an external GPU, so try removing it. If that still doesn't work, you might have to reinstall your system or restore from backup, because it is possible that your system files are damaged.\n", "Q: Before putting an iPhone5 into very long-term storage should I fully drain battery? I just migrated an iPhone5 to an X. I'd like to put the iPhone5 into very long-term (probably 1+ year) storage. While I'll hopefully never need it again, I'd like to keep a back-up iPhone at the ready.\nGiven the chemistry of iPhone batteries, before putting it in a safe place for a very long time, should I drain the battery to 0%? or 100% charge, and power-off?\nIt is fresh off of a factory reset, so there is no data to be lost on the phone.\n\nA: When it comes to Apple products and batteries I recommend users refer to what Apple has to say about its batteries.\nHowever, to answer your question, I quote directly from Apple:\n\nStore it half-charged when you store it long term.\nIf you want to store your device long term, two key factors will\naffect the overall health of your battery: the environmental\ntemperature and the percentage of charge on the battery when it’s\npowered down for storage. Therefore, we recommend the following:\n\n*\n\n*Do not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is\nfully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state,\nwhich renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you\nstore it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may\nlose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n\n*Power down the device to avoid additional battery use.\n\n*Place your device in a cool, moisture-free environment that’s less than 90° F (32° C).\n\n*If you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge it to 50% every six months.\n\nDepending on how long you store your device, it may be in a\nlow-battery state when you remove it from long-term storage. After\nit’s removed from storage, it may require 20 minutes of charging with\nthe original adapter before you can use it.\n\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 5 slowed down by Apple? If so how to revert? Given that Apple slows down your phones to save battery, how do I speed my iPhone 5 back up now I have replaced the battery myself?\n\nA: The iPhone 5 is not affected by the slowdown, only the 6 & higher - see How can I verify if Apple is slowing down my phone because of an old battery?\n\nA: In addition to Tetsujin's answer, even if your phone were affected, if you've replaced the battery, then your phone would be working at full speed again. The throttling is based on the phone's internal diagnostics of the battery condition. Assuming the new battery you put in is equal to or better than the original battery, then the phone would automatically un-throttle.\n", "Q: Syncing contacts between devices How people sync contacts between devices on PC, Tablet, Phone?\nWhen i use same apple account on my ipad and iphone it is ok but it is not possible to sync with my Android Tablet (google account) and my PC (Microsoft Account)\nHow to achieve that?\n\nA: Don't use an Apple account. You can sync contacts from Google or Microsoft accounts with iOS devices, so use one of those accounts to store your contacts.\n", "Q: Do you need an iPhone to build iPhone apps? I have an iPhone but am thinking of getting a OnePlus 5T and selling my iPhone. \nI also have a Mac and I've started to develop React Native apps too. \nIs the iOS simulator enough to test and publish apps to the iOS App Store, or should I keep my iPhone? \n\nA: Strictly speaking, no, you do not need to have an iPhone in order to build iPhone apps. The iOS Simulator does a pretty good job and allows you to test how your app is likely to work on a range of iPhone models (or other devices).\nHowever, having some physical devices you can install your apps on is certainly an advantage. In my own app development there have been a number of times that I've identified that something just hasn't looked quite right on an iPod, iPhone or iPad (whereas in the Simulator it looked fine). And, I've also had instances where something didn't quite look/work right in the Simulator, but it was fine on a physical device.\nOnly you can decide whether keeping your iPhone is worth more to you than selling it.\n", "Q: What do I need to do to be able to use keyboard combinations, instead of Touch Bar clicks? I am blind user and I must use a program which is an accessible with Voiceover, the Apple screen reader. That’s why I need a way to press keys instead of learning to click something which I don’t see.\nOn a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, how do I use keyboard combinations, instead of Touch Bar clicks?\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts can be found in System preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts. You can set any shortcuts to any keyboard combinations you'd like. The default for voiceover is Command + F5, which can be changed.\nThe Touch Bar can also be set to only display the Function Keys, instead of app specific context keys. While you won't be able to feel the position of them, they will remain there when any app is open, acting like a standard keyboard rather than the Touch Bar.\n", "Q: How to change the switch window key? On my Macbook with a US-International physical keyboard, the windows of one application are cycled with CMD+`. Now I also use an iMac that has a German keyboard (the printing on the keys).  I switched the layout to US-International, but weirdly, the windows of one application are now switched with CMD+> instead. This is exactly the key that would be in the same location as CMD+` would I be using the German keyboard layout. I am not using that layout, though and I don't want to cycle windows with CMD+>.\nHow can I customize this setting?\n\nA: The language specific shortcuts are set up when the computer is first set up. In my case, the computer was set up in German and I only later switched it to English. Then the default hotkeys do not change. The desired behaviour (switching windows with CMD+' could be enabled by going to System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard and then pressing \"Restore defaults\". In particular \"Move focus to next window\" changes then.\n", "Q: A better alternative for source code file browsing than finder+quicklook? I'm not an IDE user and I spend a lot of time going back and forth between finder windows opening files in quicklook just to look at a thing here and there. This gets awkward fast, specially as QL loses the spot I was reading at, and the file browser is not as attuned to this usage as that of an IDE file browser. Also, the QLStephen source code preview stops working from time to time. \nI'm wondering, is there any lightweight alternative to browsing source files like this?A finder replacement, a terminal utility, or something like those old school image file browsers ala ACDSee but for text?\nI'd be happy if the column view of the finder showed me a full pane scrollable preview of the text so I didn't have to open QL, but other desirable features would be the ability to set a project folder with a file tree in the sidebar, bookmarking folders/files, search across project folder, and dreaming big, the possibility to go to function definition. \nBeen thinking to write something like it myself but I just keep thinking something like it must exist somewhere. \n\nA: BBEdit is able to have multiple documents open at one time and then there is a left side sidebar you can easily change between documents. In the menu bar go to VIEW > Show Sidebar. It appears to keep your highlights and scrolling of each document. You can use BBEdit for free without paying for it as well but it will ask for you to pay for the first couple weeks. BBEdit has markers, grep find/replace, and multi-file search as well. Sounds like a lot of what you want.\n\nA: The Firefox browser will let you navigate the filesystem and view text files. This will open a browser window starting at your home folder:\ncd; open -a firefox . \n\n\nA: If the files you are using QL on have the same extension you can set a certain app to open those files. Then double-clicking the file will allow you to browse it. \nIf you right-click on a file of the type you are browsing and select 'get info' you can go to the bottom of the 'get info' window and select application to open the file with. Then under that click on open all files of that type with same app.\nI selected the quickest editor on my machine (TextMate in my case) and use that to open the files. This gives me a simple and quick way to view text files. I use the same apps for text files with extensions of .txt, ,dat, .out, .py, .f90, etc. If I need a different app I can use the open with selection by right-clicking or by starting the app and opening file from new app.\n", "Q: Can I run migration assistant multiple times for multiple computers? I have 2 old macs with data that needs to be moved to 1 new mac. Can I simply run migration assistant twice, moving the data into the same user account on the new mac?\n\nA: Without the source or the full functionnal specification from Apple it is impossible to give you an answer with no risk.\nTo clarify your question let's say your 3 Macs are named A, B and C.\nA being the oldest one, then B, and C the younger one.\nYour question is \"can I run Migration Assistant this way\":\nA → C\nand then\nB → C\n\nI am convinced that Apple didn't take into consideration such a scheme of migration which might lead to data loss or corruption.\nOn the other hand, if you want to run Migration Assistant this way:\nA → B\nand then\nB → C\n\nI am convinced that the integration process will work correctly on B and then on C.\nIn this case, make a full backup of B before starting.\n\nA: No. Migration won’t merge or combine accounts. Applications might work as I haven’t tried it, but user accounts can’t collide. \nAt best you could migrate all the users with different names then switch, export and merge by hand. \n", "Q: iPhone Boot loop stuck The phone has never been jailbroken. Never got wet, anything. \nBut after one night it reboot, and got stuck. The battery overheat and even after a few attempts to solve the issue through iTunes, Recovery and DFU mode, it continues stuck at the same part of the boot. \nI really don't know what to do anymore. \nIt is an iPhone 7 Plus 256, 2 months without warranty! Thats the worst!! \nI'm running iTunes 12.7.2.58 on a MacBook Pro\n\nA: Many things can cause a boot-looping device. \nTry these things (if you haven't already) to see if anything helps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a hard reset (Home & Power button for 10 secs)\n\n*Use a genuine Apple Lightning connector\n\n*Use a genuine Apple charging brick and let it charge overnight\n\n*Try to connect it to different computers (mac/pc if possible) with an updated iTunes\n\n*Put the phone in recovery mode (search DFU Mode). Careful, this can reset your data \n\n*Use 3uTools for putting it in and out of Recovery Mode\n\n*Use 3uTools to flash the firmware (you can't downgrade)\n\n\nIf you are comfortable opening your device (now that it's out of warranty) then consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the Front Camera Ribbon from the logic board and reboot\nyour phone\n\n*Disconnect the screen assembly completely and see if iTunes will recognize the phone.\n\n\nOtherwise, you may have a logic board issue. If you are uncomfortable doing these steps, consider either doing an OOW replacement at Apple or finding a reputable, independent repair shop to do the troubleshooting.

There's no need to reboot into Recovery Mode, disable SIP or FileVault, or move/disable the plists controlling the daemons related to device enrollment and management. You can edit the hosts file in Terminal while logged in normally, although not using those \"echo\" commands (even typing 'sudo echo \"0.0.0.0 albert.apple.com\" >> hosts' gave the error 'permission denied: hosts').

What does this command do?\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\n\nA: The command has nothing to with the serial port as such.\nThe \"sudo\" part means that you want to run the command that follows with superuser privileges.\nThe command is nvram, which is a command that allows you change variables in the NVRAM that is used by the firmware and kernel during boot of the computer.\nThe variable here is \"kext-dev-mode\" which is being enabled by setting it to 1. Ordinary kernel extensions (mainly drivers) must be signed by the developer, and the developers certificate needs to be signed by Apple - otherwise the kernel extension cannot be loaded.\nThe \"kext-dev-mode\" is intended for development scenarios where you want to test unsigned kernel extensions. Thus allowing these to be loaded without testing if they are indeed signed.\nHowever, kext-dev-mode is no longer used for anything.

I reinstalled the original 1TB hard drive (also called MacintoshHD but not currently being used) and bought an external Thunderbolt 4TB drive. Onto this I've copied my home folder (at root level  so the supplied LaCie setup software is untouched in the root too).\nI have successfully restored everything but my Movies and Downloads folders (which stupidly I excluded from TM because of space issues!) by copying the contents of the .../Backups.backupdb/Macintosh/Users/operacentric folder to the new drive. Thus the new drive doesn't duplicate all users and system folders that the original had.\nI want Time Machine to continue using the existing backup set (at least until I can afford an 8TB new drive when I can start again!) It has backups for SSD and MacintoshHD until the last backup but one (which is when the HDD failed). So the Latest folder contains an SSD backup but the previous one has folders for both drives.\nHaving read the manual page and various guides here and elsewhere about TMUTIL, I believe I can use Associatedisk to relink the backup to the new drive. However, they don't deal with the issue of having two drives in the backup. I am not quite sure of the syntax - do I use the root drive name (LaCie), the Users folder or the operacentric folder?\nsudo tmutil  associatedisk [-a] mount_point snapshot_volume\n\nIs the mount_point:\n\n\n*\n\n*/volumes/LaCie or\n\n*/Volumes/LaCie/Users or\n\n*/Volumes/LaCie/Users/operacentric ?\n\n\nCan I use the actual snapshot volume rather than the (missing) link in Latest?, so\n/Volumes/TimeMachine/Backups.backupdb/iMac/2017-12-24-000806/MacintoshHD\n\nor do I enter the same point of the hierarchy\n/Volumes/TimeMachine/Backups.backupdb/iMac/2017-12-24-000806/MacintoshHD/Users/operacentric?\n\nAll the posts I've seen here relate to a single drive - not sure how to work with the internal and the external...\n\nA: I am extremely confused as to what names are what disks and partitions and such in your particular scenario. Therefore I will attempt to provide some guidance on the ‘associatedisk’ verb and how to use it, but I can't say for sure the exact commands to run with the names of your existing disks as I don't know what's what.\nThe associatedisk verb takes a mount point and a snapshot volume, as you found from the man page. This means if you are backing up a disk named \"Macintosh HD\" on a computer named \"George's MacBook\" to a Time Machine backup disk named \"Time Machine HD\", to reassociate this disk to the backup you would run:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" \\\n  \"/Volumes/Time Machine HD/Backups.backupdb/George's MacBook/Latest/Macintosh HD\"\n\nThe -a flag associates all other snapshots of the same volume to the disk. This might be useful as you mention something about ‘Latest’ link being broken — point at a specific date/time and use the flag so that the other snapshot dates are associated too.\nFeel free to add to your question with a list of disks, partition names and what their purpose is in your setup and I might be able to provide some specific commands to run.\n", "Q: How to prevent Mail.app from marking legit mails as junk First of all, I've seen How to prevent mail app from marking e-mails from VIP as spam and did the steps.\nFor some reason, Mail.app (macOS 10.13.2) thinks perfectly legit mails are junk:\n\nThese are mails that I voluntarily opted in to receive.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried \"Move to Inbox\" on some, but it doesn't help new ones received as junk.\n\n*The answer at the above link says \"right click the mail and select 'Not Junk'\", there is no such option.\n\n*I've set my junk filtering as follows:\n\n\n*I've added the sender to my contacts, I can confirm that it's added with its email address.\n\n*I've also tried replacing the \"From does not contain\" field in the screenshot above with the actual email address of the sender instead of its name.\n\n*I've added the sender to VIP.\n\n\nAfter all these, these mails (which for me are important to be notified immediately upon receiving) are still being marked as junk.\nAm I missing something obvious, or Mail.app is seriously flawed?

Looking at my rules, I see that when I'm using a \"From\" targeted rule I always use the actual email address, or partial email address, like \"@importantdomain.com.\"\nMy suggestion would be to change your last line to a subject rule, so \"Subject does not contain TradingView.\" If that makes the rule work, then there definitely is a problem with the email address in your contact you created for this sender.\nAnd not strictly speaking an answer, but I would leave the spam rule for strictly finding spam and then have a separate, higher rule that would look for the \"TradingView\" emails, sort or flag them, then under \"Perform the following actions:\" choose \"Stop evaluating rules.\" That should find the TradingView emails, do what you want with them, then perform no more rule actions on them. A little bit of a different philosophy, but it has worked for me.\n\nA: There are several ways you can prevent Mail from incorrectly marking legitimate messages as junk.\nTell Mail that a message is legitimate by marking it as not junk. Click Not Junk in the banner of the message; or select the message, then click the Not Junk button  in the Mail toolbar (or use the Touch Bar).\nAdd the sender to the Contacts app. For more information, see Use events, contacts, and other items found in emails.\nReview your junk mail settings in the Junk Mail pane of Mail preferences, as well as any rules you might have created to handle junk mail, and make changes as necessary. - Apple Site https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/if-junk-mail-filters-arent-working-mlhlp1145/mac\n", "Q: How to \"Optimize for\" an external monitor, downscale resolution but supersample for clear text? I posted question here but got no answers --\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8203211\n\nANSWER: \nAdd a custom scaled resolution that's twice the resolution you want (for HiDPI / macOS retina). This requires editing system files.\nSTEPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Mac. Turn on Mac, holding CMD+R during bootloader, Utilities -> Terminal -> csrutil disable; reboot\n\n\n\n*Login, download SwitchResX, install without helpers\n\n*Add a custom, scaled resolution 3200x1800 (looks good as 1600x900 HiDPI in 1440p)\n\n\n\n*Shut down Mac. Turn on Mac, holding CMD+R during bootloader, Utilities -> Terminal -> csrutil enable; reboot\n\nA: I think you're misusing the term supersampling.\n\nSupersampling is a spatial anti-aliasing method, i.e. a method used to remove aliasing (jagged and pixelated edges, colloquially known as \"jaggies\") from images rendered in computer games or other computer programs that generate imagery.\n\nmacOS has always had support for TrueType, so any issues shouldn't be a result of poor antialiasing in any case.\nWhat you really want to do is change the scaling of your external monitor while keeping the native resolution. You should be able to accomplish this using SwitchResX with a HiDPI profile.\n\n", "Q: iMac Pro running 2 LG Ultrafine 5k, blurry Just plugged in two LG 5K Ultrafine displays on either side of my iMac Pro 8 core. Everything on each display is slightly blurry. When I unplug one of the displays, the other returns to razor sharp clarity as I expect. \nEach monitor is plugged directly into the iMac - no daisy chaining.\nHow can I get both monitors to show clearly?\n\nA: Most likely, you are plugging the displays into the same Thunderbolt controller (ports adjacent to each other).  To ensure you're using the other controller, use the ports on the \"opposite side\" of the bus\nAccording to Apple:\n\nNote: The Thunderbolt 3 ports on your iMac Pro are managed by two\n  controllers, one for the two left ports, the other for the two right\n  ports. Each controller can support two 4K displays or one 5K display.\n  So you can connect up to four 4K displays or two 5K displays to your\n  iMac Pro. To connect two 5K external displays, for example, connect\n  the first 5K display to either of the first two Thunderbolt 3 ports,\n  and the second 5K display to either of the last two Thunderbolt 3\n  ports.\n\n\n\n\nA: The 8 core model simultaneously supports up to two (5K) external displays at 5120 x 2880 pixels running at 60 Hz, and can do this while the internal display is also functioning, so there's no doubt your Mac is capable of doing what you want.\nAssuming your settings fit in with the above and you've already plugged them into the ports as described in Allan's answer, I would try doing an NVRAM reset and, if that doesn't work, a SMC reset as well.\nHow to reset NVRAM on the iMac Pro\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac Pro\n\n*Switch on your iMac Pro\n\n*Immediately press and hold the OptionCommandPR keys. \n\n*Keep the keys down until after the Apple logo appears and disappears for the second time. \n\n\nNOTE: Upon reboot you may need to reconfigure some of your System Preferences (e.g. sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, time zone, etc).\nHow to reset the SMC on the iMac Pro\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac Pro\n\n*Press and hold your iMac Pro's power button for 8 seconds\n\n*Release the power button and wait 5 seconds \n\n*Switch on your iMac Pro\n\n", "Q: If I remove my internal optical drive from my 2012 MacBook pro, will an external superdrive work? My internal optical drive is not working despite attempts to clean it. I have an external USB Superdrive but it will not work with my MacBook Pro since it has the internal optical drive. If I just remove the internal drive, will my MacBook Pro recognize (and work properly with) the superdrive. I primarily use the superdrive to copy audiobooks from CDs into my computer.\n\nA: You can install multiple external USB optical disks if you want, the tricky part is being able to have macOS / OSX identify it distinctly from the internal one when it comes to operations such as ejecting.\nI've had two DVD-ROMs installed on a Mac Pro tower in the past and the only difficulty was in regards to the keyboard's eject button. If there is only one optical drive in the machine, there is no confusion. However, with a second drive you have to press Option-Eject or click on the \"Eject Icon\" on the menu bar and select which one you want to work with. Of course, you can disconnect the original drive and then the confusion by the OS will go away.\nFWIW, I've found that the Apple branded external SuperDrive is overpriced and doesn't offer any advantage over other USB-driven optical drives. From my personal experience, the \"Amazon Basics\" drive performs just as well for about half the cost. Despite that one no longer being available, I can't imagine that it would be any more/less compatible than the others you can find online for even cheaper.\n", "Q: Deleted 1 of 2 partitions in Mac OS High Sierra and cannot see it any more with Disk Utility I deleted 1 of 2 partitions with the following commands to merge 2 partitions:\ndiskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s3\ndiskutil eraseVolume free n disk0s3\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nBut I got the following error when I run the last command:\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\nStarted APFS operation\nError: -69771: The target disk is too small for this operation\n\nNow the partition which I deleted is not shown any more with Disk Utility. How do I get it back?\n\n\n\n\nA: You received the error message because the Apple_KernalCoreDump partition resides immediately after the Apple_APFS partition. This I was able to verify.\nI can not think of a reason to keep the Apple_KernalCoreDump partition. So, I would enter the commands given below to add the free space to the Apple_APFS partition.\ndiskutil  erasevolume  free  n  disk0s3\ndiskutil  apfs  resizeContainer  disk0s2  0\n\nIf after deletion, the Apple_KernalCoreDump partition reappears, then I would assume you drive is corrupted. In this case, I would backup important files, repartition the drive and reinstall macOS. \n", "Q: If I quit Terminal.app, do processes that it initiated quit with it? If I use Terminal to initiate a time-consuming process (in this case, deleting a large .sparsebundle file on my Time Capsule, which could take hours) and if I then quit the Terminal app itself before that process has completed, does that ongoing process (the deletion) also quit? Or does Terminal just act as the 'trigger' and the process runs autonomously regardless of whether Terminal.app is active or not?\n\nA: For the command to continue after closing the Terminal application window, you need to do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Precede the command with nohup. This will allow the command to continue after the Terminal application window is closed. This also allows the command to continue after the quitting the Terminal application.\n\n*Redirect standard out and standard error to the same or different files. This gives the output someplace to go, otherwise the default will be use. (See the man page below).\n\n*Append a & to the end of the command line. This runs the command in the background, otherwise you will not get a command prompt until the command finishes.\n\n\nFor example, if I wanted to use the find command to search for the file readgpt and print the results to a Terminal application window, I would execute the command given below. Note: Here, I do not care about the error messages, so I redirected standard error to /dev/null.\nfind / -name readgpt -print 2>/dev/null\n\nNow, if I wanted to close the Terminal application window and view the results later, I would execute the command below.\nnohup find / -name readgpt -print >~/Documents/results.txt 2>/dev/null &\n\nAfter entering the above, you will get a job number in brackets followed by a process number. An example is given below.\n[1] 1456\n\nYou can get the status of this process by entering the ps command, as shown below.\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ ps 1456\n  PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND\n 1456 s001  U      0:06.83 find / -name readgpt -print\n\nYou can terminate this process by entering the kill command, as shown below.\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ kill 1456\n[1]+  Terminated: 15          nohup find / -name readgpt -print > ~/Documents/results.txt 2> /dev/null\n\n\nNote: If you enter the kill command in a window that differs from one used to create the process, then there probably will be no output.\n\nThe man page for the nohup command is given below.\nNOHUP(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 NOHUP(1)\n\nNAME\n     nohup -- invoke a utility immune to hangups\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     nohup [--] utility [arguments]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The nohup utility invokes utility with its arguments and at this\n     time sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored.  If the standard output\n     is a terminal, the standard output is appended to the file nohup.out\n     in the current directory.

Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The following variables are utilized by nohup:\n\n     HOME  If the output file nohup.out cannot be created in the current\n           directory, the nohup utility uses the directory named by HOME\n           to create the file.\n\n     PATH  Used to locate the requested utility if the name contains no\n           `/' characters.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The nohup utility exits with one of the following values:\n\n     126     The utility was found, but could not be invoked.\n\n     127     The utility could not be found or an error occurred in\n             nohup.\n\n     Otherwise, the exit status of nohup will be that of utility.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     builtin(1), csh(1), signal(3)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The nohup utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'')\n     compatible.\n\nBUGS\n     Two or more instances of nohup can append to the same file, which\n     makes for a confusing output.\n\nBSD                              July 19, 2001                             BSD\n\n", "Q: Mac OSX High CPU % Usage - Draining battery and heating!

Text in both this monitors look awfully blurry.\nExample:\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Preferences: Font smoothing enabled/disabled (makes no visual difference at all).\n\n*AppleFontSmoothing set to 0, 1, 2, 3.... also no visual difference.\n\n*The edid patch to foce RGB also didn't work (applied the patch succesfully but didn't make any visual difference). Didn't remove it though and my color profile is set to 'Forced RGB'.\nSame monitors in a Windows machine don't present this problem (at least the one connected through DVI, VGA looks a little off too but that might be the connection).\nAny ideas?\nThanks!\nEdit: Additional details. Monitors are both the same, Lenovo E2323. No settings aside from contrast, brightness, colors, clock... basic stuff.\n\nA: It will look blurry because Apple designed their system to look best on retina (high PPI, around 200) displays. I've been trying out everything but nothing works, except one thing - running Windows in bootcamp or remote session. \n\nA: I had the same issue with a 1080p monitor connected to my 13\" rMBP. Mine doesn't have a DVI port so I couldn't try that, but I did try the other stuff: \n\n\n*\n\n*Connecting from MDP to HDMI, MDP to VGA, HDMI to HDMI. Nothing helped.\n\n*Font smoothing from preferences or 0, 1, 2, 3: This produced a very slight difference, but not enough to keep my eyes from getting sore from all the pixelation. \n\n*Forcing RGB output using the EDID script. No noticeable change, apart from the same profile change as yours, it's set to 'Forced RGB' now.\n\n\nI did find something that works for me, and I recommend you try it too. Download a trial of SwitchResX and try setting the resolution to one of the resolution from the HiDPI list. The difference was immediately noticeable when I switched from a HiDPI scaled resolution to a non-HiDPI resolution in the list. Apple probably only likes HiDPI monitors for Mac, and doesn't show a HiDPI option in the scaled display options on 1080p monitors like ours.\nI'm using the scaled 1280x720 HiDPI resolution in SwitchResX and that fixed the awful blur for me. Some pixelation is still there which is probably expected from a 1080p monitor compared to the 1600p on my rMBP, but the monitor is now usable.\n\nA: Same MacBook. My brand new Samsung C49RG90 connected in Picture-by-Picture mode with the two display-port outputs exhibited awful fonts. I found out that by simply reducing the default sharpness setting of the monitor from 60 to 50 fixed everything - no need to tweak AppleFontSmoothing or CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled.\n", "Q: How can I boot back into macOS if Windows install in Bootcamp fails?

I've also tried to right-click and click on \"Paste\" (which is highlighted) but that also yields nothing.\nQuestion\nIn any case, is there any way to simulate pasting on Mac OS X? Maybe by sending multiple key presses instead?\n\nA: Turns out the problem was that the copied password (and the one with which I thought I registered) was longer than 20 characters. The input field on the application doesn't allow more than 20 characters long password and the website silently cuts them to 20.\nBy copying the first 20 characters of the password I was able to paste it in.\n", "Q: How do I access Itunes U Course Manager if my country isn’t supported?

I have also created a new apple ID which has an adress in the US but still when i try to log into the Itunes U Course Manager it says “Country not supported”.\nIs there a way to bypass this?\n\nA: Use a VPN.\nYou can use a service like TunnelBear (not affiliated) so that you can appear to be using the service from another country.  \nIf you have a \"friend\" in the country of question, you can set up your own VPN (OpenVPN) between your and their locations.  This is obviously a DIY solution and you would need the requisite skills.\n\nA: Here are the 2  ways to solve this problem with success. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download a GPS faker app from the Apple App Store. \n\n*Or just fork out the money and buy a house in the United States. \n\n", "Q: How to edit the Finder context menu when no file or folder is clicked I want to create shortcuts like \"Copy path of current folder\" and \"Open terminal in current folder\" in the screenshotted context menu. I know how achieve this with Services and Automator but only for when a file or folder is right-clicked. How do I do it when a blank area is right-clicked?\n\nA: You asked, \"How do I do it when a blank area is right-clicked?\", well sans the content of the default context menu, I believe something has to be selected to be acted upon otherwise you'll always just get the default context menu. That said though, you could create an Automator Service that receives no input in Finder and assign it a keyboard shortcut. Then using AppleScript, you would code it to do what you want based on the target property of the front window of Finder.\nThe following two example AppleScript code segments can be used in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Service to which a keyboard shortcut can be assigned or as an AppleScript Application created in Script Editor and the app dragged and dropped onto the Toolbar in Finder.\nThis example copies to the clipboard the POSIX path of the current folder of the front Finder window:\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set the clipboard to text items 1 thru -2 of POSIX path of (target of front window as string) as string\n    end tell\nend try \n\nThis example opens Terminal to the current folder of the front Finder window:\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set theTargetPath to text items 1 thru -2 of POSIX path of (target of front window as string) as string\n    end tell\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"pushd \" & theTargetPath & \"; clear\"\n        activate\n    end tell\nend try\n\nThat said though, the only other thing I can think of would be to use Xcode and create a Service or App Extension to do what you're asking, if it's even doable.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and, sans the try statement as an error handler, does not include any other error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted, the onus is upon the user to add any appropriate error handling for any example code presented.\n\nA: There are 2 apps that add an icon to the finder window which will open a terminal window in the directory displayed. The apps are 'GotoShell' and 'ShellHere'. I have both apps and they both seem to work equally well. GotoShell allows the user to select either Terminal or iTerm for your command line program.

I'm running Windows 10 in Parallels on my brand new 2017 Macbook Pro.  While at work, I have two attached monitors and an old clicky Windows keyboard.\nThe problem is that I can't get Parallels to accept the higher function keys.  F5 works, but not F11, which is very critical to a .Net developer.\nI'm adding the Touchbar Tag because I'm honestly not sure if Touchbar settings are causing this issue. This is an upgrade and I use to not have this issue on my four year old Macbook Pro.  It's inaccessible, so I can't check the settings, but I don't remember this being as big an issue.\n\nA: Problem solved. In my case, I turned off the F11 and F12 function key usage.  Specifically, I had to go to System Preferences > Keyboard.  From there, select the Shortcuts tab, and then select \"Mission Control\" from the left-hand list.\nWithin the Mission Control shortcuts, disabling Show Desktop and Show Dashboard restored F11 and F12 key-usage in Parallels.  I'm not sure what's special about these keys and why the others seem to work without issue, even though they are assigned as Shortcut keys.  Regardless, this fixed my issue.\n", "Q: Turn off vibrate when charging wirelessly When I place my compatible iPhone on a wireless charger, it slowly falls off the charger over time as vibrations come in from messages.

Maybe some kind of tests or similar information. \nIf an iPhone has 75% from design capacity should it be replaced or not?\n\nA: The simple answer to your question is to replace the battery when you feel your device needs to have the battery replaced. In other words, if your device no longer functions as long as you need on battery power, then it's time for you to consider replacing the battery (or the device).\nYou don't specify the exact models of your devices, but any MacBook produced in recent years has a battery rated at capable of 1,000 charge cycles. Also, clicking on the Battery icon in the menu bar will indicate its health and, if necessary, whether you need to service or replace it.\nIn terms of iPhone batteries, they're rated at capable of a maximum of 500 charge cycles. Apple has also confirmed that a future iOS software update will provide users with info about the health of their battery, allowing them to determine if the condition of their battery is affecting their iPhone's performance.\n\nA: In iOS 12 update, you will be able to see the battery health and status, which will warn you if your battery needs to be replaced or device performance gets slower.\n\nIn fact, 75% of battery health is just fine for everyday use, but you should consider battery replacement instead.\n\n", "Q: Is there a Meltdown vulnerability fix already available for macOS? \nWhile Apple has yet to comment on the flaw, Alex Ionescu, Windows\n  security expert, noted a fix was present in a new 10.13.3 update to\n  macOS.\n\nsource: How to Protect Yourself From Meltdown and Spectre, the Latest Processor Security Flaws\n\nA: Meltdown\nmacOS patched December 6, 2017 in macOS 10.13.2\niOS patched December 2, 2017 in iOS 11.2\nApple patched CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) in macOS High Sierra 10.13.2, Security Update 2017-002 Sierra, and Security Update 2017-005 El Capitan.

Looking at the CVEs assigned to this particular vulnerability,* we can get listing of the issues that should be addressed by Apple when they decide to issue a security patch:\nThere are three CVE's assigned to these issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 are assigned to Spectre.  There's currently no patch available.  However, according to Apple, the vulnerability is \"very difficult to exploit\" but can be done via Javascript.  As such, they will issue an update for Safari on macOS and iOS in the future\n\nApple will release an update for Safari on macOS and iOS in the coming\n  days to mitigate these exploit techniques.

The SSD contains a defunct APFS partition.\n\nAPFS currently doesn't support the combination of two partitions into one superior container/volume properly. Creating an APFS Fusion Drive isn't possible yet.\n\nThough possible APFS on HDDs isn't really recommended.\nIf you insist on restoring the MB SSD to the HDD I recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the HDD and install macOS High Sierra\n\n*Open Migration Assistant and try to migrate the content of the SSD disk image to the HDD\n\n\n\nIf you want to restore the image one-to-one use the following steps which depend on how you created the image.\nYou can either image the container or your mounted main macOS boot volume.\n [\nIf you have imaged the main macOS boot volume only, most APFS volumes (i.e. Preboot, Recovery and VM) won't be added to the image file and they will be missing in the destination container. A restore will finish successfully; the APFS system volume will probably be bootable. To get full functionality you have to reinstall macOS High Sierra.\nIf you have imaged the whole container, all APFS volumes (including Preboot, Recovery and VM) will be restored.\nIf your source volume was encrypted and you didn't image the whole container, I doubt that you will successfully restore the image and boot to the result - it's worth a try though. I haven't tested this variant.\nIn either case you have to \"Scan to Restore\" the image which requires free space of a similar size as the original image on the same volume!\nThis can be done in the GUI (Disk Utility) with \"Images -> Scan Image for Restore...\"\nTo restore the image, partition the destination drive (your HDD - your SSD is much too small to host the content of the 512 GB SSD) to one APFS container with Disk Utility.\nGet the partition details: diskutil list.\nThen open Terminal and restore the image (assuming the destination partition is disk0s2):\nsudo asr restore -s /path/to/image.dmg -t /dev/disk0s2 --erase\n\nReboot to the restored main macOS volume.\nAs mentioned previously reinstall the latest macOS High Sierra version if you didn't image the whole container in the first place.\n\nA: Merging SDD and HDD of Fusion Drive: Two years have gone by since the question of @andilabs and the answer of @klanomath.  I would like readers to know that Apple has put out a solution in February 2020 to make Fusion Drive work as it is designed to do in the first place under APFS.  Here's the post https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207584.\nBackground: My iMac migrated to Catalina and I did not even have to bother to know anything about APFS.  Everything appeared as before - 1 drive.  But recently, due possibly to some software, my iMac slowed right down in starting up and log-in. Doing a 'Restore' in Safe mode could not complete; it consistently stopped at about 2~3 minutes before completion. With the guidance of Apple Support, I got my system back. But what I got back was stubbornly divided in 2 parts: APPLE HDD (2 TB) and APPLE SDD (128 GB), the 2 components in the configuration of my Fusion Drive. Restoring macOS needs you to pick a drive.\n\nInstalling macOS on the SDD part should in principle get the benefit of speed but work often ran into insufficient space problems.\nThen macOS was reinstalled on the HDD part.  All worked fine, but this defeats the purpose of using a Fusion Drive!\nNow with this method by Apple of February 2020, I hope I will get back the full power of my Fusion Drive.\n", "Q: How to use WiFi for everything, except a specific connection to my NAS (Ethernet) WiFi is the best connection at my house for most things. I have it first in network preferences under service order.\nHowever, I have a NAS connected over a local switch which I want to connect to via Ethernet.\nThe route is such that if I use WiFi, I reach the NAS via Powerline which dramatically slows the link.\nWhen I disable WiFi I can connect to the NAS nice and quickly over Ethernet. If I do this, then all my other network connections go over Powerline and they are bad.\nQuestion: How do I have both adapters enabled, prioritising WiFi, but utilising Ethernet for my NAS connection?\nNote: I have tested and OSX does not find the local switch's Ethernet route with both adapters enabled and WiFi prioritised. It dumbly uses whatever is in the service order, whether it's Ethernet or WiFi. I had hoped it would choose the best route.\n\nA: \nIt dumbly uses whatever is in the service order, whether it's Ethernet or WiFi. I had hoped it would choose the best route.\n\nIt doesn't \"dumbly\" do anything.  It performs as expected; if priority is given to WiFi, it will direct all traffic over that connection.  Keep in mind, macOS (out of the box) doesn't prioritize traffic as it's not a router/switch.\n\nQuestion: How do I have both adapters enabled, prioritising WiFi, but\n  utilising Ethernet for my NAS connection?\n\nPut your NAS on a different subnet.  You can do this with a different switch, with VLANs (if your switch supports it) or you can direct connect it.  Just keep in mind if you want to share access to the NAS, you either need to have a multi-homed (multiple network adapters) on your NAS or you need a router between the networks (a layer 3 switch would be nice, but they're expensive)\n", "Q: Updated Apple Mail, now hung and cannot send or receive emails A couple of days ago I updated Apple Mail but after the update its hung up.

I am not relying on Time Machine as well because it starts backing up everything on the Mac. Looking for a decent solution to backup apple mail but how can I do it if it's hung up like this.\n\nA: You can go directly to the folder where Mail saves its data through the Finder and duplicate it to store a copy elsewhere.\nInside the Finder, menu Go > Go to Folder and then paste this path:\n~/Library/Mail/V5\n\nIt is that V5 folder you'd want to back up before reseting Mail.\nThere is also some software solutions like mailbackupx but I never used it so I can't say what it's worth.\n", "Q: BK3001BA Keyboard not connecting after entering correct passcode I can't seem to connect my BA3001BA Bluetooth keyboard to my mac.

About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING\nPARTITIONS!!\n\nThe thing is, I'm afraid the process will overwrite my main partition as well.\nRight now if I go to my Disk Utility I have this:\n\nIt is in Portuguese but I think you can understand the important things.\nSo, my question is: If I give it a \"Y\" in terminal, will it overwrite both of my partitions or only the partition called \"BOOTCAMP\"? (Will it erase my main partition?)\nThank you\n\nA: If you want to do what you propose, then you are correct.\nWhile using gdisk, you can the check GUID Partition Table (GPT) by entering the P command. After you enter the N command to change the Master Boot Record (MBR) table, you can again enter the P command. You will see the  GPT is unchanged. To see the changes to the MBR table, you will need to enter the following command before and after using gdisk.\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0\n\nBut, you do not want to do this for a 2010 MacBook Pro.\nThe 13-inch, mid 2010  MacBook Pro should install Windows 10 using the legacy BIOS boot method. The Windows Support Software for installing Windows 10 on your model Mac can be found at: Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. \nApple does not officially support Windows on your model Mac beyond version 7. The drivers for 64 bit Windows 7 are in the Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033  download. Fortunately, Windows 10 is designed to accept older version drivers, when current drivers are unavailable. Unfortunately, these drivers are designed for the legacy BIOS boot method. \n\nNote: I am used the Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 download to install 64 bit Windows 10 Pro on my 2007 iMac. Apple does not officially support any 64 bit versions of Windows on any 2007 Mac models. In spite of this, I am able to run 64 bit Windows 10 Pro on my 2007 iMac. \n\n\nA: You are using Hybrid MBR which is both MBR and GPT at the same time and disk partition information is mirrored in both GPT and MBR - see Hybrid MBR. So OS that looks for GPT will find GPT info and OS that looks for MBR will see that. Disk utility and Boot Camp Assistant will make sure that the changes in GPT table will be reflected in a MBR copy. So in effect the BOOTCAMP partition you have created is already in the GPT table (as well as in MBR) and your proposed changes are not needed. Even your output from gdisk shows:\nFound valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT.\n\n\nA: Yes, yes it will overwrite both partitions, as it will overwrite the partition table.\n", "Q: Is there any way to reliably get rid of the caches in com.apple.MediaLibrary safely? I found >10 GB of files inside a folder on my internal drive. It comprised of photos and videos which I recognized from my system photo library (which is synced with my iCloud Photo Library):\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.MediaLibraryService/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.iLifeMediaBrowser.ILPhotosTranscodeCache\n\nUpon Googling why this was occurring, I came to the conclusion that this was likely due to there being HEIC/HEVC media in my iCloud Photo Library (from my iPhone). Apparently macOS High Sierra converts these media files and stores them in the aforementioned folder so that other apps can \"select media from the Media Browser.\" Source 1, Source 2\nIn the interest of saving internal disk space I store the system library on an external drive. I don't want these caches to also take up space on my internal drive. I have no interest in being able to \"select media from the Media Browser.\"\nI additionally noticed that this huge folder is backed up by Time Machine, which is absolutely horrendous. Why would I need a large folder, full of cache files which I will never use, to be backed up?\nThere are a couple of ideas I came up with to fix this. Each idea has its cons. My main goal here is to get rid of these cache files once and for all (since I'll never actively use them) in a safe way. I am not sure which one would be the best idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the files inside the com.apple.iLifeMediaBrowser.ILPhotosTranscodeCache. I realized that the media was simply converted and put into that folder again; this does not work.\n\n*Delete the folder completely. I'm not sure if this would cause the folder to be recreated, but I don't want this to mess something up; this probably will not work.\n\n*Change the permissions of the folder to prevent the process from writing to it – this seems like a very forceful way to prevent the process from dumping converted media into the folder; I'd prefer a cleaner method.\n\n*Downgrade to macOS Sierra. I do not want to go down this route.\n\n*Transfer the whole folder to the external drive, and then create a symbolic link on the internal drive pointing to it. This is probably the safest method, but could be unreliable – what if I disconnect the drive? What would the process do to handle this?\n\n\nA: I don't think you should have to worry about the disk space being used by this. macOS should be treating that sort of thing as \"Purgable\", so if you are ever running low on space, macOS would automatically be able to remove that data to give you operational space back. So as far as space you can use on the disk, you should be able to consider the space currently used by that as free.\nIf it's a real bother though, your last option could be modified a little for reliability, which may solve the problem, depending on the Mac you have.\nBasically, you could get a USB drive or SD Card of adequate size (also taking into consideration likely future needs, so say 32GB, or maybe 64GB, depends how many photos you take) and have it permanently connected. Instead of a Symlink, you could use macOS's fstab to cause the drive to use the com.apple.iLifeMediaBrowser.ILPhotosTranscodeCache folder as it's mount point, both on boot and automatically when reconnected if it is ever removed while your system is running\nA caveat of course, is that if your Mac is a portable, and you do take it places with you, this will be less convenient, since you still have to reconnect that drive every time you boot up. A Nifty Drive or JetDrive would solve this if it is a MacBook model with a SD slot and you don't use the slot... You can also get USB drives quite small now-a-days, think the size of a Logitech \"Unified\" wireless keyboard/mouse adapter, so you could safely leave that connected with a notebook, and it wouldn't be in the way on the back of a desktop, aside from of course having one less USB port.\nRough How-To\nTo do this, you would want to format the external drive/card to match the format of your internal drive.\nWith the newly created partition selected in Disk Utility, click the Info button (letter i in a circle) on the top right of the window, and then find the FileSystem UUID. Click on it, copy it with Command-V, and onwards to the Terminal!\nIn Terminal, you'll need to run the vifs command as root, using sudo.\nvifs uses the vi text editor to modify fstab, after locking it so nothing damages it. If you don't know how to use vi for text editing, type :h and then the return key to get to the help text. It explains editing much better than I can \nIn short, use the arrow keys to get to the bottom empty line below the warning text about being careful with fstab, then type :i to enter insert mode, and type:\nUUID=<Your Filesystem UUID Here> /Users/<Your Home Folder Here>/Library/Containers/com.apple.MediaLibraryService/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.iLifeMediaBrowser.ILPhotosTranscodeCache hfs   rw\nReplace HFS with whatever filesystem you formatted it as.\nExit Insert Mode with the ESC key, and type :wq to write your changes and quit. If you want to quit and discard your changes, type :q! instead.\nAfter this, eject the drive/card, delete the contents of the cache folder and then insert the drive again. Should mount to that location and macOS will start dumping the cache data there again.\nThe Upsides\n\n\n*\n\n*Frees up space on internal drive permanently, while keeping that cache accessible for apps that may use it (you never know, you might just start)\n\n*Fails gracefully if you remove the drive/card, as macOS will just act like when you deleted the contents and re-create the cache. When you re-attach the drive, it will mount back to the original location again, where-as with a symlink you may need to create the symlink all over again (depends if it was a clean unmount, and what happens when macOS tries to write through a broken symlink I guess, I'm not sure if it will destroy the symlink and change it back to a normal folder or just stop with an error\n\n*Will always be mounted during startup, so it will be there from Boot to Shutdown for macOS to send data to\n\n*One external drive could be used for multiple caches, if there are others you want a similar space saving from, but you would need a partition per cache. If you're using APFS on the external drive, this won't be a problem, as all APFS Partitions share the total storage of their drive (I do this with my Plex server's Transcode cache and Mobile Sync cache to spare partitions on my DAS, cause they just get so gorram big!)\n\n\nThe Downsides\n\n\n*\n\n*Not likely to be great if you use a NoteBook, unless you invest in a tiny USB drive or a form-fitted SD Card such as Nifty Drive or JetDrive\n\n*Requires more hardware you may need to purchase\n\n*Not 100% sure how macOS will react if you have a partially rebuilt cache in the library folder after the drive is disconnected, and then re-connect the drive/card and it mounts as the cache folder. My Plex caches haven't had a problem with that happening before since they don't re-populate when cleared until next time I'm watching/syncing something, but the macOS one might be interesting since it would start rebuilding straight away. Hopefully it would just delete what's in the cache at that point, or move it to the external drive/card. You might want to test that early on to see what happens\n\n*You lose a USB port or a SD Slot, which may or may not be an issue, that depends on your needs\n\n\nAgain, macOS should dump those caches automatically if you ever actually need the cache, so you probably don't HAVE to do any of this, but if you really really want the space back, that is how I've done it on mine (Plex doesn't mark it's caches as pursuable for macOS, so it's this or manually clear them every now and then for me...) \n", "Q: Add a startup script in macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 I have a weather station program that I would like to run automatically in Terminal when I log in.

If the home network is running 802.11n or 802.11ac, can the Air Play from a Macbook to Apple TV video playback be guaranteed to be the same as if connected by a cable?\nThere may be 2 Wifi or up to 3 Wifi data streams happening: (1) from the NAS to the Macbook (by Wifi), and then (2) from the Macbook to the Wifi router, and (3) from the Wifi router to the Apple TV. If the video files in on the Macbook locally, then there will be 2 data streams only (the (2) and (3) above).\nBesides, is there a monitor tool that can show the data is only at a 33%, 50% or 80% of the max Wifi bandwidth, to show that it is running smoothly in general?\n\nA: No, you can never guarantee the network connectivity. You could always experience interference from other networks, jammers, etc. which temporarily block signal reception. Similarly with a cable you could have defective cables that aren't working perfectly.\nIn general you can achieve network speeds with 802.11ac that well exceed the speed of a 100 Mbps cable connection and approaches the speed of a 1000 Mbps cable connection (or even exceeds it in optimal scenarios).\nIf your question is whether or not AirPlay from a MacBook to an AppleTV can work well over 802.11ac - then the answer is yes. However, you'll have to try yourself with your own network components and surroundings to determine if it works well for you - there's no guarantee.

Since exploiting many of\n  these issues requires a malicious app to be loaded on your Mac or iOS\n  device, we recommend downloading software only from trusted sources\n  such as the App Store. Apple has already released mitigations in iOS\n  11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2 to help defend against Meltdown. \n   [emphasis added] Apple Watch is not affected by Meltdown. In the coming days we plan to\n  release mitigations in Safari to help defend against Spectre.\n\nIs it safe to use hardware that cannot be updated to one of these three operating systems? Furthermore, in the case of obsolescent devices, are there significant differences in the safety of old iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs in terms of these vulnerabilities?\n\nA: Depends on what your definition of safe is.\nIf you want to have a guarantee that your computer will not be compromised through the Meltdown/Spectre techniques - no, it is not safe.\nIf you want to be reasonably sure that the risk of your computer being compromised through the Meltdown/Spectre techniques in the short term is low, then yes it is safe.\nPlease be advised that even if you do no install new third party programs, you will still be vulnerable through Javascript, Flash and similar on web pages, and through programs that feature auto-updating systems that could potentially download malicious software.\nAs far as know right know, there is a significant difference between the safety of iOS devices (iPhone/iPad/AppleTV (not first gen)) and Intel Macs. This is due to the fact that the Intel CPUs in the Mac is more susceptible to Meltdown/Spectre than the ARM CPUs in the iOS devices. I.e. more variants of exploits are successful on Intel than on ARM at the moment (considering that you the device is outdated and will not receive any software or firmware updates to mitigate these attacks).\n", "Q: Can the files being transferred affect/slow the data throughput? I'm currently trying to carry out the initial backup of an iMac using Time Machine, backing up to a Time Capsule (3TB, the older 'flat' type). The TC is connected via Ethernet and for reasons to do with our home network I've given it a static IP address as per this article: https://www.macworld.com/article/3170186/network-storage/how-to-configure-a-time-capsule-as-an-ethernet-only-storage-device.html\nWifi on the iMac is turned off, so the connection is definitely via Ethernet. Nothing else is connected to either the iMac or the TC (wireless is off on the TC too) other than a printer connected via USB to the TC.\nThe data on the iMac totals about 500GB ad for the first 300GB of the backup everything proceeded as expected with data-sent rates (observed via Activity Monitor's Network tab) of 20-35 MB/sec — about what I expect to see from Ethernet. Around the 300BG mark, however, data rates fell through the floor to about 5KB/sec, about one 5000th of what I should be getting. \nI left it to continue overnight but in the morning the data rates were the same and in 6 hours it had transferred only a fraction of 1GB to the backup, so I quit the TM backup and started it again. The backup process seems to have picked up where it left off, but the data rates are still crummy — typically giving me 1.3MB/sec with occasion spikes up to 20MB/sec and frequent drops back down into the KB range.\nSince I know that this ethernet setup can and has supported decent speeds (even earlier on in the same process), presumably there is nothing inherently wrong with the network itself. I'm puzzled as to what might be causing the slowdown. I wondered if it might be caused bu the backup processing certain types of files (very large monolithic ones, or huge numbers of small files, for example)?\nIs that feasible? \n[Update: the throughput has currently jumped back up to 20-30MB/sec. Nevertheless, my question still stands: can the particular files being backed up affect the data rate?]\n\nA: Yes, the nature of the specific files can affect the data rate.\nEspecially if you have lots of small files the transfer rate is usually a lot worse than if you have few large files.\nThe reason for that being that the backup software has to use time to open/close each and every small file and possible transfer data at small block sizes (i.e. each file could have only few bytes in them).\nCompare that to large files where the number of file system calls is low, and it is possible to transfer data at the optimal block sizes from disk and further on (might for example read from disk in 4 MB blocks or similar).\n", "Q: APFS: fsroot tree is invalid after Time Machine backup - how to recover and avoid in the future?

The last time I have used the computer, roughly 20 GB were still free on the macOS SSD. For a day or so, Time Machine backups have not completed, but no error message was shown. When the problem happened, I had left the machine turned on over night to complete an incremental Time Machine backup. The connection here is, that Time Machine is apparently using APFS snapshots. I suspect this is the root cause of why this mess happened.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to fix this (without reformat and restore from backup)?\n\n*What's the best way to avoid this in the future (especially with regard to Time Machine)?\n\n\nThanks.\nUpdate\nWhen running fsck_apfs with the debug flag -d, the output contains a bit more information:\n** Checking volume.\n** Checking the container superblock.\n** Checking the EFI jumpstart record.\n** Checking the space manager.\n** Checking the object map.\n** Checking the APFS volume superblock.\n** Checking the object map.\nerror: invalid dstream.size (10730881024), is greater than dstream.alloced_size (71151616)\nerror: xf : INO_EXT_TYPE_DSTREAM : invalid dstream\nerror: inode_val: object (oid 0x16309a1): invalid xfields\nobj-id: 23267745 type: Inode      \nprivate-id: 23267745 parent-id: 12896552 cr/mtime: 1515089959653928186/1515090145416398252 \ndef-prot-class: 0 \nuid/gid/mode: 0/0/0x8180 bsd_flags: 0x0 internal_flags: 0x8280 name: NO-NAME\n** Checking the fsroot tree.\n   fsroot tree is invalid.\n** The volume /dev/disk2 could not be verified completely.\n\n\nA: I just ran into similar issue. Likely you would have found that the problem was in one of the files for the Parallels VM - at least that was the culprit in my case. Your fsck_apfs -d /disk/<disk> check returned:\nobj-id: 23267745 type: Inode\n\nIf you had opened terminal you could have gotten the path to the file (or files) using that inode using the following command:\nfind / -inum 23267745\n\nFrom there you would have known which file(s) needed to be restored instead of doing a full restore.\nIn my case the VM file was only available in the snapshot as I exclude my VMs from TimeMachine. I restored just that file from an earlier snapshot and I got further through fsck_apfs - it got through the disk to checking snapshots and then bombed on same file in the 2nd snapshot. Luckily snapshots are only kept for at most 24 hours so it should clear up after that point.\nYour mileage may vary however as it could be as \"simple\" as one file or just the tip of the iceberg.\n", "Q: Time Capsule corruption problems Since upgrading to High Sierra I often get a verification problem of my backups on Time Capsule.

I want to create an \"application\" in Automator for recording mouse actions. When it is run, i want it to execute the actions in the background, like it happens when a macro is run in excel, rather than simply replaying it like a movie. Is this possible?\n\nA: Update Note:\nMy original answer, shown further below, was written using a generic example and not the actual target because it had not yet been disclosed. Once it was disclosed, in a comment, I downloaded CopyClip 2 and wrote the AppleScript code using UI Scripting to bring up the Advanced Preferences pane, click the Delete All Clips button, the subsequent Delete All button, close the Preferences window, and close the UI that shows the clips. It works, however it's UI Scripting and you see it as though manually done, but it happens much faster and without seeing visual mouse movements across the screen. (Not really a background solution.)\nThat said though, I found CopyClip 2 to be very unstable and crashed every other or few times I ran the script, and why I'm not posting the code unless you really want to see it. So I don't recommend the UI Scripting method. Note that the instability expressed was just in conjunction with using AppleScript on the app and not the overall use of it. (I actually have not used it other then to answer the question.)  \nLooking now for a background solution, I investigated how CopyClip 2 stores the clips, and found where the clip datastore was and in what form. Not surprisingly, it's stored in an SQLite database. So with that information, I see two different options:\nThe first involves manipulating the data stored in the SQLite database. The problem there is, I don't do SQL programming, so you'd have to pursue that option on your own.\nThe second option is more of a quasi-brute-force method but it works well and did't crash the app in the process. It involves programmatically quitting CopyClip 2, deleting the clip database, and restarting CopyClip 2.\nEither of these option would be considered the background method, especially when compared to using UI Scripting.\nThe following example BASH script code is what I used for the second option mentioned. It can be run in a number of different ways.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -n \"$(pgrep \"CopyClip 2\")\" ]; then\n    pkill \"CopyClip 2\"\n    sleep 1.5\n    for i in $HOME/Library/Containers/com.fiplab.copyclip2/Data/Library/Application\\ Support/CopyClip/*; do\n        rm \"$i\" 2>/dev/null\n    done\n    open -a \"CopyClip 2\"\nfi\n\nI first tested this a half dozen or so times in Terminal as an executable BASH script before I used the code in a Run Shell Script action in an Automator application, and tested another half dozen or so times. For my 2 cents worth, this is the way I'd go over trying to do the SQL programing option even if I knew SQL.\nSaved as an Automator application, e.g., Delete All CopyClip Clips, I used Spotlight to find and execute it, i.e.:\nCommandSpacedelEnter\nThe application could also be placed in the Dock for a quick mouse click to delete all the clips too.\nBy the way, I also have Hide window as startup set to ON on the General tab in Preferences for CopyClip 2, so as to make this as background as possible in appearance. This way, unless you're looking directly at the Menu bar icon for CopyClip 2, you don't really notice it's been closed and reopened.\nAlso, note that the clip database is normally created upon first run and only changes as clips are stored or deleted through CopyClip 2. I examined the clip database using SQLiteBrowser when first created and after deleting all the clips and its structure is essentially no different then when first created1, so repeatedly deleting the clip database really isn't a problem to achieve the goal. (1 While technically there are some differences, the deleted data had not be removed from the database by the VACUUM command yet, nonetheless this option is extremely safe and should not be problematic with repeated use.)\n\n\nOriginal Answer:\nUsing the Record button in Automator, you've recorded some mouse clicks on the Menu bar and this produced a Watch Me Do action in the workflow. Subsequently running the Automator workflow containing the Watch Me Do action, to use your words, it plays like a movie.\nSo you are asking if this can run in the background more like an Excel macro then play like a movie?\nGenerally speaking, the short answer is both yes and no... yes more like a macro (sort of), but no not in the background.\nThat said, note however and depending on the target application and what needs to be done, there may be the possibility of coding something to perform in the background but without knowing the explicit specifics it's beyond the scope of  this generally speaking short answer.\nThe longer answer is, to convert the Watch Me Do action into appropriate AppleScript code. However, because it uses UI Scripting it cannot run in the background, but it can run much more efficiently and faster then a Watch Me Do action played back and you do not see the visual mouse movements across the screen. This means that when the AppleScript code is run, by whichever means one choose, one has to allow the script to process its code uninterrupted, thus being one of the drawbacks of UI Scripting.\nHowever, I believe you'll find this more desirable then playing like a movie and seeing the mouse visually move across the screen.\nAs an example, recording my actions while using the Clock on the Menu bar in this example, I'm going to click the Clock menu item, then click the Open Date & Time Preferences… menu item, then click the Close button on the Date & Time Preferences pane of System Preferences, which is opened as a result of the two previous clicks.\nIn Automator, I select the three Events in the Watch Me Do action, then press CommandC to copy the events to the clipboard.\nNow I open Script Editor and in a new document, press CommandV to paste the copied events from the clipboard.\nThis produces the AppleScript code shown at the very end of this answer, which is placed there because not much of it will actually be used, but it will have the key pieces of code, so not having to manually type all of the finished code and is only included herein for completeness of this example case.\nWithin the pasted code there are three commands that represent the actual click events, and since this is using UI Scripting it's being done by System Events.\nSo, in another new document, in Script Editor, I add a tell application \"System Events\" block, e.g.:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\nend tell\n\nWithin that tell block, I copied the appropriate portion of the three click events from the code pasted in the other document while removing the unnecessary code and backslashes for this use case, e.g.:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    click menu item 6 of menu 1 of menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    click UI element 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\nend tell\n\nNow because this is UI Scripting, appropriate delay commands need to be added, e.g.:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    delay 0.5\n    click menu item 6 of menu 1 of menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    delay 2.5\n    click UI element 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\nend tell\n\nNow while I could run the code above (or even the originally pasted code) and it should function properly at this time, the problem is that menu bar item 7, which is currently the Clock on my system, can change. So too in some cases, can the menu item n change as well, although not in this example use case. However, knowing this, lets rewrite the code so it's not hard coded for the menu bar item number or the menu item number:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    -- click menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    click (every menu bar item of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\" whose description is \"clock\")\n    delay 0.5\n    -- click menu item 6 of menu 1 of menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    click (every menu item of menu 1 of (every menu bar item whose description is \"clock\") ¬\n        of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\" whose title is \"Open Date & Time Preferences…\")\n    delay 2.5\n    -- click UI element 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    -- click button 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    quit application \"System Preferences\"\nend tell\n\nIn the code above, the original three lines of code have been commented out, i.e. -- was added in front of each line. Also, the original third line has an additional line under it commented out, but was added to show how to generalize the original third line. However, since its purpose in this example was to close System Preferences, just tell it to quit instead.\nSo the final example version of the code to handle the three events that took place in the example Watch Me Do action in Automator is:\ntry\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click (every menu bar item of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\" whose description is \"clock\")\n        delay 0.5\n        click (every menu item of menu 1 of (every menu bar item whose description is \"clock\") ¬\n            of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\" whose title is \"Open Date & Time Preferences…\")\n        delay 2.5\n        quit application \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\nend try\n\nNow comparing this final example version of the code above to the original code shown below, one can see the difference and what's necessary to cleanup the original code while not hard coding the menu bar item number or the menu item number, thus making it more intelligent then using the Watch Me Do action in Automator. \n\nNote: The example AppleScript code above is just that, and sans wrapping it in a try statement, does not include any other error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted, the onus is upon the user to add any appropriate error handling for any example code presented and or code written by the oneself. This includes setting the value of the delay commands as appropriate for the timing on ones own system.\nAdditionally, not all menu items are as easily scripted as this example case and in some cases may not work well to even use this method, it just depends and is one of the reasons I was trying to get more explicit and specific information from you in my comments. That is, I might have been able to give you explicit and specific code for your immediate need, rather then having to write an answer using an example. Although, hopefully this example with be useful to may others as well.\n\nOriginal AppleScript code generated when events were copied and pasted from the Watch Me Do action in Automator for this example use case:\n-- Click the “clock” menu bar item.\ndelay 0.249747\nset timeoutSeconds to 0.500000\nset uiScript to \"click menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \\\"SystemUIServer\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds )\n\n-- Open Date & Time Preferences…\ndelay 0.186764\nset timeoutSeconds to 0.500000\nset uiScript to \"click menu item 6 of menu 1 of menu bar item 7 of menu bar 1 of application process \\\"SystemUIServer\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds )\n\n-- Click the “<fill in title>” button.\ndelay 0.509640\nset timeoutSeconds to 0.500000\nset uiScript to \"click UI Element 1 of window \\\"Date & Time\\\" of application process \\\"System Preferences\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds )\n\non doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n    set endDate to (current date) + timeoutSeconds\n    repeat\n        try\n            run script \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n\" & uiScript & \"\nend tell\"\n            exit repeat\n        on error errorMessage\n            if ((current date) > endDate) then\n                error \"Can not \" & uiScript\n            end if\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend doWithTimeout\n\n", "Q: Brother MFC Scanner not recognized any more I have a Brother MFC-1910W connected by WIFI (multi functional wireless b/w laser printer, scanner and fax).

However, the bugs discovered has made me a little bit concerned.\nI am a software engineer and I am most definitely a \"Power User\". Apparently, some users, particularly users performing more \"heavy duty\" tasks, may experience a performance drop of up to 30%. I don't know how accurate this report is - I've not read much into it.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are new (2017+) CPU's affected by this flaw, too? \n   If so, when will CPU's start to come out that are not affected?\n\n*Will new (affected, unsold, still in shop) products have their CPU's replaced?\n\n\nAs I understand it, Meltdown can be patched with software, but Spectre can only be fixed with a hardware redesign...\nMy concern is that I will purchase my MB pro in March, just to find a short time later that Apple has had all products on the market recalled and their CPUs replaced.\n\nA: To answer your questions:\n\nAre new (2017+) CPU's affected by this flaw, too?     If so, when will\n  CPU's start to come out that are not affected?\n\nYes.  It affects virtually every CPU going back to 1995\n\nIt affects potentially all out-of-order execution Intel processors\n  since 1995, except Itanium and pre-2013 Atoms.\n\nAs for when new CPUs will be released, that's impossible for anyone here to even speculate as it will require a hardware redesign.  Apple won't even be able to speculate as it's dependent on availability from the chip manufacturers.\n\nWill new (affected, unsold, still in shop) products have their CPU's\n  replaced?\n\nNobody but Apple (actually all computer manufacturers for that matter) will be able to answer this.  Given that new, unaffected CPUs don't currently exist, it's reasonably expected that new machines purchased will still contain the flawed CPUs.\n\nMy concern is that I will purchase my MB pro in March, just to find a\n  short time later that Apple has had all products on the market\n  recalled and their CPUs replaced.\n\nIt's a valid concern.  Nobody here can predict what actions Apple will take if any.  The best advice I can give is to take a wait and see approach given that March is two months away and there is bound to be further developments with respect to this issue.  If you need a new Mac for \"work\" (i.e. to generate revenue that pays the bills), bite the bullet and purchase it.  If this is something you can put off as it's not critical, I would take a wait and see approach.\n\nApparently, some users, particularly users performing more \"heavy duty\" tasks, may experience a performance drop of up to 30%\n\nAccording to an Intel Press release, they don't anticipate seeing any significant drop in performance for real-world deployments.  Chances are, you will not notice any drop in performance.\nIntel has also released patches for these flaws and is working with OEM partners (like Apple) to push them out to customers.\n", "Q: How many APPLE_APFS partitions is a disk allowed to have?

My problem is: MacBook Pro 13\" early 2015 is not turning on and charging and the trackpad is also dead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Charger's LED does not shine by any light(red/orange/green) . But I tested my charger with another MacBook and charger is working.\n\n*I tried to connect another charger. First 1-2 minute I can see green light and then LED turns off.\n\n*Trackpad is not react to any action (like double click). Right now this is just some plastic area\n\n*Turn off and turn on battery connector also didn't help me.\nThe laptop did not receive any damage and was not flooded with water. Day or two before I got it from safe and checked my email then closed it and put to the safe again(hotel standard safe) (everything was okay but I didn't remember battery charge percent at that day) then I open and figured out that MacBook is dead.\n\nA: Your MacBook is dead.\nWithout putting hands on, I would guess that you have an issue with the DC-in board.  It's the interface between your charger and the logic board and battery.\n\nYou have already done the requisite diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verified the your charger works\n\n*Verified that known working charger doesn't work on your MBP\n\n*Attempted to boot with battery disconnected\n\n\nOne final test you could attempt (if you have it available to you) is to use a battery from a known good MacBook Pro of the same model.  If it boots, you will verify that the logic board is functional and confirm it's the DC-in board.\nAs far as the trackpad goes, it has no relevance here.  It's ultimately a USB device and if the MBP has no power, the trackpad won't either.\nIf it is the DC in board, it's a relatively easy and inexpensive fix.  iFixit.com has excellent instructions.  It is still possible that it could be a logic board failure, but based on my experience that's it's unlikely.  \n", "Q: Change predictive text language independently of keyboard?

According to a just released press release directly from Intel, Industry Testing Shows Recently Released Security Updates Not Impacting Performance in Real-World Deployments, the following OEMs/Manufactures have stated the following:\n\nApple: “Our testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes\n  in the December 2017 updates resulted in no measurable reduction in\n  the performance of macOS and iOS as measured by the GeekBench 4\n  benchmark, or in common Web browsing benchmarks such as Speedometer,\n  JetStream, and ARES-6.”\nMicrosoft: “The majority of Azure customers should not see a noticeable performance impact with this update. We’ve worked to\n  optimize the CPU and disk I/O path and are not seeing noticeable\n  performance impact after the fix has been applied.”\nAmazon: “We have not observed meaningful performance impact for the overwhelming majority of EC2 workloads.”\nGoogle: “On most of our workloads, including our cloud infrastructure, we see negligible impact on performance.”\n\nApple also goes on to further expand on the testing stating that:\n\nOur current testing indicates that the upcoming Safari mitigations\n  will have no measurable impact on the Speedometer and ARES-6 tests and\n  an impact of less than 2.5% on the JetStream benchmark.\n\n", "Q: How can I force my right-hand monitor to always be my primary monitor on my MBP? I have a new MBP with 2x 4k monitors.  Due to the layout of my desk, I want my right-side monitor to be my primary display.  I know how to set this up within the display settings, however, I have to do make these changes every time I connect my monitors-- they do not persist.\nSpecifically, I have a new 2017 MBP with the 4x USB-C ports. Every day, I consistently connect monitor #1 (the one on my right) then monitor #2, which should be my secondary display.  It never fails, monitor #2 becomes my primary display, and the display \"seam\" isn't between the two monitors but is instead along the outer edges of my display..  In other words, I can't drag my mouse from the left side display, to the right side display, moving left-to-right. Instead, I have to move my mouse to the left-side of my left monitor, and then it will transition to the right-side of my right monitor, as if the orientation of the two display is suppose to be flip=flopped on my desk.  \nEvery morning when I plug in my laptop, I have to change the orientation of my displays from within the Display settings screen.  I'd like to be able to set this up once, and then macOS will come to expect that when two monitors are attached, the \"first\" monitor is on the right, and is the primary display.  Can I configure macOS to persist this behavior?\n\nA: Swap the plugs over. \nIf it absolutely always does it the same way whichever way you put the plugs in, then swap the monitors over.\n", "Q: How to change the font size of Open/Save dialogs? On Sierra ... my Open/Save dialog file listing are displaying in a larger-than-normal font size.\nHow do I change this?\n\n\nA: It depends on which application is showing the larger text as it may have it's own view settings.  For instance, your Finder window has view settings (accessible from CMD-J or View->View Settings) where you can change the font of the view window to produce exactly the results you are seeing (the default is 12), whereas in Mail you can configure this from the Fonts & Colors section of Mail Preferences.  I know in some programs I've used that those settings are in the data stored in Application Preferences in the Library.  \n\nIf nothing else works and it's system-wide there isn't really a systemwide way to change fonts in macOS but there are some tools out there to help.  You could try TinkerTool to see if that is helpful for you, there is a specific tool to adjust macOS system fonts:\n\n\nA: In Mojave, at least, Font sizes in Open/Save Dialog Boxes are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nThe settings for Column View are in FK_StandardViewSettings:ExtendedListViewSettingsV2\nThe settings for Icon View are in FK_DefaultIconViewSettings\nThe settings for List View are in FK_DefaultListViewSettingsV2\nRelaunch Finder after making changes by holding alt and control and clicking on Finder's icon in the dock and clicking Relaunch.\n", "Q: Possible to preload apps in supervisor mode and prevent them from being uninstalled? I don't have a Mac or a personal Ipad to experiment with. I am trying to prevent a user from removing certain apps (not all apps).

When i go to app store, the option open doesn't work. \nAlso it's not in icloud. \n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Restrictions and confirm that restrictions are off. If restrictions are on, you'll need the restrictions passcode to turn it off.\nAlso, confirm that the top of settings doesn't have text mentioning \"This phone is supervised and managed by...\" at the top. If it does, talk to your company's IT specialist for more detail.\nLastly, on the home screen, pull down in the middle of the screen to reveal the search menu. Type \"app store\" and confirm that it doesn't show up there. If it does, it's likely in a folder or you simply missed it.\n", "Q: Disk space recovery after failed bootcamp installation attempt on a fusion drive - High Sierra first of all I must say I'm pretty amazed by all the help and great contributors on this site.

POSIX convention, I believe.\nThe quick and dirty:\nsudo pkill -1 'System Preferences'\n\nReplace System Preferences with Finder, or the PID of a relevant process.  Another quick and dirty:\nfor STALE in Finder Preferences locationd ; do sudo pkill -1 $( pgrep ${STALE} ) ; done\n\nWhat a HUP signal should effectuate in the receiving process is an internal halt and re-evaluation, which usually includes a re-reading of any relevant config files. The process will not terminate, only 'refresh' itself.\nHope this helps.\nF.\n", "Q: Can AirPods be be used with multiple Charging Case units? Can I use one pair of AirPods with two or more Charging case units? Can I take turns charging the case, and deposit AirPods into either without any bother?\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple sells a Charging Case for USD $69. \n\n*Apple announced their intention to soon sell a Qi charging case upgrade for AirPods.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can use multiple charging cases. Put the AirPods in either charging case to see the AirPod charge level and the battery level of that particular charging case. At the moment, once of my cases shows 94%. Moving the AirPods to the other case shows a 100% case charge level.\n", "Q: Replace password prompt with Touch ID to read Keychain password I'm using the following command to fetch a password from the Keychain in a shell script: security find-generic-password -w -s \"MyServiceName\"\nIt works, but it's showing a popup window asking me for the login keychain password:\n\nsecurity wants to use your confidential information stored in\n  \"MyServiceName\" in your keychain. To allow this, enter the \"login\"\n  keychain password.\nWith the options to Deny, Allow or Always Allow\n\nBut I don't want to enter my keychain password every time, so I can't use \"Allow\" and I'd rather not \"Always Allow\" in order to keep some level of security here. \nIdeally I'd like to get a Touch ID prompt instead. Is there any way to do this ? \n\nA: Investigating this I was not able to find any method that would allow for the security command to make use of Touch ID. This article titled: How to Use Touch ID to Authenticate sudo on Mac OS, mentioned in a comment regarding sudo and then use of the Touch ID, will not work here since that makes use of the addition of this line:\nauth sufficient pam_tid.so\n\nto sudo's PAM file, /etc/pam.d/sudo. There is nothing equivalent to the security command since it doesn't make use of sudo.\nTherefore you're left with using one of the 2 methods mentioned in the dialog when running the security command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always Allow\n\n*Allow\n\n\n\nIf you pick \"Always Allow\" this will grant access indefinitely just to the security command. If you pick \"Allow\" it will grant security access just 1 time to Keychain.\nExample\nHere I've created an application password item in Keychain called TestPassword.\n\nWe can see that nothing has been given access to it by looking at the ACL tab of this dialog.\n\nIf I run this security command:\n$ security find-generic-password -w -s \"TestPassword\"\n\nAnd permanently \"Always Allow\" I'll be given the password for this item from Keychain:\nTestPassword123\n\nBut more importantly I'll add security to the ACL for this item in Keychain.\n\n", "Q: Can my son block me from finding him with my find my iphone app? Can my son block me from locating him with my find my iPhone app? Is there a way for me to know if he has turned it off at all? When I was trying to locate him, he's 15, all I was seeing was a location from 3 hours prior but it showed the real time location of our other phones. Later his phone with location showed up again. \n\nA: Yes - your son can block sharing of location in several ways.\nThe best you can do is enforce restrictions on the device to prevent changes to Find My Friend / Location settings, but if your son is savvy enough to know to hide location, they will be savvy enough to:\n\n\n*\n\n*google a faraday cage and put the phone in aluminum foil\n\n*enable airplane mode\n\n*powered off the phone\n\n*sign in to an iPad somewhere else and shift that to report their location when they choose\n\n\nHere's what the restrictions look like and I've heard of good luck just talking over the restrictions with a minor and then agreeing jointly which will help them avoid temptation and which you can graduate them past with trust in the relationship.\n\nAt some point you'll need to find another avenue than technical measures for tracking or have an agreement that if you text he has so many minutes to get back to you, etc...\n\nA: Make sure that in his Find My iPhone settings you have \"Send last location\" turned on. (Settings > [His Name] > iCloud > Find My iPhone) \nThat way when his iPhone does go offline, you'll know where he last was.\nJust make sure that when you change the setting, he doesn't see it.\n", "Q: Replacement iMac G3 Chasis? Just purchased an old used iMac G3 but unfortunately the plastic subframe is pretty brittle. I doubt it's something that I could gorilla-glue back together. Does anybody know where I could buy a new subframe or a new chassis altogether?\n\n\n\n\nA: I know of no vendor that sells the slot loading inner bezel for your imac whether it’s OEM or aftermarket.\nYou could purchase a machine from ebay (or similar) and hope they pack it properly so as not to destroy the inner bezel in shipping, or you can try and gorrilla glue the original bezel together so you can scan and 3-d print a new one or hire someone to fabricate a replacement.\n", "Q: How to address/fix problems and glitches experienced on iPad Pro 12.9 inch 2017 model? Recently, I bought the iPad Pro 12.9 inch, 2017 model (as the title says) as well as the Apple Pencil, and I've been noticing a massive number of glitches that have been quite irritating. The glitches are as follows:\nReboot (happened once, but irritating nonetheless) took a very long time, I estimate around 15 minutes. When the reboot finally completed, it displayed the battery as having only 1%, even though it had 65% 15 minutes before. I tried to reboot it, only for no response until after a couple times of holding the power key (might have been that I did not hold it long enough, so I might let that slide as an issue). When it rebooted once more, everything returned back to normal; but that weird reboot session made things seem off.\nThe Locked Notes in the conventional Apple Notes App constantly have the menu (the one with the various \"pens\", eraser, selector, and colors) disappear after they lock. The workaround I have found for this issue is to find a note that has no lock on it whatsoever, open that up, and the menu appears back at the lower right hand corner. Then, I have to go all the way back to the locked note, open that up, and the menu is back.\nAnimations appear a bit chunky, or laggy. For example, opening up the Control Panel (swipe up down from the dock) feels a bit slow. Additionally, there is some noticeable lag when swiping through the apps that appear with the control panel (say I want to close an app or just switch to another).\nWhen I swipe left on the lock screen, or home screen, or notifications screen to get to all the widgets and news, there is some lag as well. Animations again feel chunky. But that's not just it; sometimes the whole entire page just flickers and has to reload everything (reload all the widgets). One time, the screen momentarily locked into that screen as well.\nWhen I reboot the iPad, sometimes I see a white line that flickers at the bottom of the screen and then disappears. This white line appears during the black screen and apple symbol.\nThe Files app doesn't always show all of the files; in fact, it makes it appear like there are no files in any of the sources at all! Sometimes it works and shows the files in my Google Drive, my iCloud, iPad, and Adobe Cloud, but often it doesnt. Even when it does show files, they sometimes seem to be some old, cached image of the files. It doesn't update as fast as it should. For example, I saved something from online to my iPad (and I was close to the router), and the Files app has yet to register it as actually being there.\nWhen the iPad turns off, it seems to just flicker, almost like it just got shocked, and then turn off. I am not quite sure if this is an error at all; but I would think that the turning off animation would be more of a fade and less of flicker (ideally).\nFailure to register the Apple Pencil until after a couple seconds in the Battery Widget. This is weird, because the pencil works fine and clearly must be already connected to do so, but the Battery widget has to reload to show the apple pencil again sometimes. This occurs after the pencil has been in use for some time, and has already been synced with the tablet.\nAgain, I am new to the whole Apple ecosystem, and I can be overly critical of products. Therefore, I am not sure if I am just expecting too much and these \"bugs\" are normal, or whether I should contact AppleCare immediately (as this device could be defective).\n—————————————(New Updates)\n\n\n*\n\n*Messenger for Facebook now has a defective keyboard. Probably an app problem, but given the plethora of issues I have, probably best to still mention it. The problem: the keyboard stops typing completely. It’s not even laggy, just it won’t simply type. There’s response from the keyboard though, as theres sounds and the darkening of the button when I tap on it, but nothing is getting typed in. As I’m typing this on my iPad right now, the issue seems to only occur for that one app (as far as I’ve seen). Weird however, as to my knowledge there hasn’t been any sort of update. \n\n*Animations seems to have improved a bit. I think doing a factory reset and wiping things clean made things work better. \n\n*Reinstalled the stylus app for my iPad, which lets me write using my pencil instead of typing. I can note that issues seemed to arise after installing the app: but not quite sure yet of again. \n\nA: The next best thing is to restore the iPhone software. Meaning erase the software and then using iTunes on a computer to restore the software with a refreshed iOS 11.0.2.\n\nBackup iPhone via iCloud (optional but highly recommended)\nPlug in iPhone to iTunes and click restore iPhone. iTunes should also\n  automatically backup the iPhone also. -\n  https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT201252 **Make sure iTunes is up to\n  date and then restore.\nOnce restore is done you are going to get the hello screen on the\n  iPhone.

At university I added a few documents to my print queue. A few minutes after I got home with my laptop still in my backpack, my printer mysteriously printed exactly two pages of the document I added to the print queue. \nI have power nap disabled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why would my sleeping laptop connect to my home wifi?

Thanks for looking!\n\nA: Sleep doesnt mean off. Its still connecting to familiar networks. I'd either turn off wifi while sleeping or power it off.\n\nA: Not very cool I would say. I was recently travelling through LHR and never opened my laptop in transit. When I got to my destination, the LHR free wifi was shown in my list of nearby networks for a few seconds, when it was obviously no longer in range. That means that while sleeping, it is scanning for networks. Hence tracking where it goes while sleeping. Yay!\nYes, I have Power Nap off.\n", "Q: Why won’t iCloud Keychain sync my passwords? I have set up two-factor authentication for my Apple ID and turned on iCloud Keychain. To test whether it backups my passwords, I turned it off and chose delete from iPhone. Then I turned it on and looked at my passwords, but nothing was there. I’ve tried many several times, but it seemed iCloud Keychain won’t store my passwords.\nI think it might be because I turned it off, rather than signed out of my Apple ID, or it might be something wrong with my iCloud configuration.\nPlease help me resolve this problem.\n\nA: If you have no other Apple devices, then when you chose to delete your passwords, you likely deleted them from your phone (at first).  But when you re-enabled iCloud, you synced your current phone status to iCloud, which is / was password-less and removed the content from iCloud as well.  \n", "Q: What’s going wrong with printing my mini booklet? I’m preparing a miniature book-style document—that is, I plan on stacking the sheets one on top of the other and binding them in the center, where two portrait pages are printed on each side of the landscape US letter sheet of paper.\nI’m working with 2016 Microsoft Word for Mac (version 15.24) and OS X El Capitan (version 10.11.6).\nThe first thing I noticed was that the Mac version does not seem to have a feature that automatically prints documents booklet style. Therefore, I edited the page setup within Microsoft Word so that each page has the dimensions 5.5” × 8.5” (exactly half of a US letter sheet). Then, I exported the document as a PDF and rearranged the pages appropriately so that I could bind the document as a booklet in the middle (as opposed to a packet with a staple in the corner).\nThe problem occurs when I select my paper size in print preview:\n\nIt appears that when I select “US Letter” as my paper size with “2 Pages per Sheet,” Preview automatically prints two scaled-down US letter pages on one US letter sheet rather than letting each half-US-letter page take up half of the sheet.  As a result, I have a large margin of dead space around each page of content.\nAre there any ways to troubleshoot this problem? How can I ‘outsmart’ the system so that my content takes up the entire sheet?\nI am not a frequent visitor on this site, so please adjust the tags if appropriate.\nEdit: I’ve been meaning to order A4 paper anyways since I’m an international student and I like its dimensions better anyways. I have some coming in on Monday, and the proportions of A4 paper will resolve the issue. Nevertheless, I would still like to be able to print booklets on US letter paper, just to know how.\n\nA: Although MacOS doesn't comes with a built-in booklet maker, there are a number of ready-made options to avoid doing this manually. \nPDFs can be easily manipulated (\"imposed\") into booklet spreads, and there are several apps to do this, both on the Mac App Store and on developers' websites. Some are free, some are very cheap.\nAdobe Reader contains a booklet setting in its print menu.\nYou can find a \"PDF Service\", which will make booklet PDFs and save them to disk here. You will need to install it in your user Library's \"PDF Services\" folder, which may need creating if not present. Then it will be available in the PDF button of every print dialog. (It's currently set for A3, but there's an option in the script to change the paper size.)\nSome Printer drivers have the function built-in, particularly on large-sheet printers.\n", "Q: Using VirtualBox on Mac HighSierra - installing Windows 10 via external hard drive, not working! Installed VirtualBox on my Mac (HighSierra), my version 2014, doesn't have a CD-ROM/DVD drive so I'm using a portable drive to install Windows 10 64-bit. VB isn't recognizing the external drive. Frustrating, not sure what to do? Any help? TIA\n\nA: VirtualBox can emulate a DVD (optical) drive. To insert a DVD into an emulated drive, you must first convert the physical DVD to an iso file. You can select this iso file under Settings, as shown below. By the way, if Virtual Box did recognized your external DVD drive, then this external DVD drive could also be selected here. In the image below, my internal DVD drive is listed as Host Drive 'HL-DT-STDVDRW  GA32N'.\n\nNote: You can click on an image to get a better view.\n\n\nThe instructions below were copied from this Apple website.\nCreate your own ISO\nUse these steps to make an ISO copy of your Windows DVD:\n\n\n*\n\n*While your Mac is started from OS X (or macOS), insert the Windows installation DVD in an external optical USB drive.\n\n*After the installation media mounts in the Finder, open Disk Utility from the Utilities folder (choose Go > Utilities).\n\n*Select the USB optical drive so it's highlighted in the Disk Utility window.\n\n*Choose File > New Image, and then select your Windows DVD from the submenu.\n\n*Choose DVD/CD master from the Image Format menu, then choose none from the Encryption menu.\n\n*Give the new file a name, then click Save. If prompted, enter an administrator user name and password. A progress bar appears while the image file is created (it might take some time to create the image file).\n\n*After imaging is done, eject your Windows installation disc. Disconnect the external optical drive from the USB port after the disc ejects.\n\n*From the Finder, locate the disk image file you created earlier. Single click on it to select it, then press the Enter or Return key on your keyboard to rename the file. Change the disk image file extension from .cdr to .iso. When prompted, click \"Use .iso\" to verify this change.\n\n\n\nNote: Another possibility would be to download the Windows iso from this Microsoft website.\n", "Q: Access photos only from select albums on all my devices I would like the ability to view photos grouped under two \"People\" (two children, say) in Photos 3.0 on all of my Apple devices. Basically I take new photos with my iPhone and occasionally sync them over to my MacBook. I want to view all photos in those two albums on the iPhone (when visiting relatives, say).\nI don't want to upload all of my photos to iCloud, so iCloud Photo Library does not seem to be the right option.\nI want the ability to view all photos from those two albums (people) on my devices, so My Photo Stream (which covers only recent photos) also does not seem to be the right option.\nI want to \"share\" these photos with myself, not necessarily with others, so iCloud Photo Sharing does not seem to be the right option either?\nIs there native support in macOS and iOS for what I want to accomplish?\n\nA: I guess I was halfway stuck between an older way of doing things (sync) and a newer (cloud). The older way still offers selecting individual albums (e.g. for the two faces) for syncing between two devices.\nPhotos apparently still makes lots of mistakes in assigning photos to albums (as is its want) and therefore the result is still less than optimal overall, but it is probably the right way for me to go.\n", "Q: Deleting all photos in iCloud I want to delete all my photos from my iCloud (ca. 2500 Photos), so that I have no photos in the iCloud.\nI have gone into my iPhone's Photo app and selected all 2500 Photos and deleted them. Then I deleted them from the \"recently deleted\" album in the Photos app. It said that this would delete them from all devices connected to my iCloud. \nNow, my iPhone's Photos app is absolutely empty, which is what I wanted.\nHowever, 24 hours later, on my other iOS devices, as well as on iCloud.com (accessed through my laptop), the Photos are still visible, even though it says \"Updated\".\nDoes it just take some time for the deletion of all photos to sync to all iOS devices/iCloud.com, or is something not working as I expect it to work?\n\nA: It could take several hours to delete photos from iCloud. You're deleting 2500 photos so it could take more than 24 hours to delete them depending on when you've plugged your iPhone into power and connected it to wifi. \nYou are aware that once these photos are deleted they're gone for good (unless you have another backup somewhere) and you can't get them back?\n", "Q: Cannot write on TimeMachine data disk - told \"Don't have enough permissions to write to '/Volumes' - files say (unknown) read&write Cannot write on TimeMachine data disk - told \"Don't have enough permissions to write to '/Volumes' - files say (unknown) read&write, staff read&write, everyone read&write\nDetails: I have a brand new laptop but am using an old AirPort TimeCapsule - I've been able to download files directly to it from my previous Mac, but not this new one.

I also suppose you connect to the TC share using SMB or AFP or the Finder windows sidebar: just check the credentials with which you are connecting (clic on TC in side bar, clic \"Connect as...\" in top bar). I never had any luck trying to change user permissions on a share from another machine. I believe you should check AirPort Utility/File Sharing/Secure Shared Disks/With accounts looking for user credentials, following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202254.

Each new music file triggers an Adobe script which imports the new track to an Adobe After Effects project which exports it to AME and then quits. The music is then moved to another directory. \nI've ran in to an issue with passing in a filename to an Adobe script, so to work around this have made a template Adobe script with a placeholder filename (the file path would always be the same) which can be duplicated, have the placeholder filename replaced (via a batch script, though there could be a simpler way of doing it I'd suspect), executed and then deleted. \nAs a first pass I've been trying to focus on getting the name of new files to the folder, now with mixed success.

Since then, the OP has been updated to address what was expressed in the first three paragraphs and they may now seem out of context. However, looking at the edit history of the OP one can see the relevance in context of the original question. They will remain for now until I have the time to make an appropriate edit.\n\nSorry, but your question is not that well defined and it's not totally clear what actions you added to the Automator Folder Action workflow, sans the obvious Run AppleScript action. Nor is it clear if there are any actions added before or after the Run AppleScript action. Additionally, it's not clear what code is in /Users/jeffolaa/pointer.sh or all of what it's doing. Which leads me to believe that just passing the name of the file to pointer.sh may not be enough. Although without seeing the code in pointer.sh, at this point only you know.\nAlso, the form of the AppleScript code you've shown in the OP is not the proper form for an Automator Folder Action workflow using a Run AppleScript action. The on adding folder items handler is of the type used in an AppleScript script (.scpt) file that is manually assigned to the target folder using the Folder Action Setup... command from the Services context menu in Finder, not Automator, where you need to use the on input handler in the Run AppleScript action.\nYou also have no error handling code, which is important in Folder Actions and the type and amount can depend on what you have coded in the pointer.sh. In other words, you might want to filter the items added to the folder by type, making sure it's a file not a folder, or a particular type of file with a given extension, etc. This can be done in Automator before it gets to the Run AppleScript action, or in the code of the Run AppleScript action, or in the code in pointer.sh, or a combination of any or all of them.\n\nWith that said, the following example AppleScript code is a minimal coding of what makes sense to be able to pass the quoted fully qualified pathname of the file(s) added to the target folder you set in Automator's Folder Action receives file and folders added to [folder] to pass to  pointer.sh, as that's typical of an argument passed to a shell command.\nMinimal example AppleScript code for use in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Folder Action workflow:\non run {input, parameters}\n    repeat with i from 1 to count input\n        try\n            set thisItem to item i in input\n            set thisItemsPathname to quoted form of POSIX path of thisItem\n            do shell script \"/Users/jeffolaa/pointer.sh \" & thisItemsPathname\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend run\n\nMinimal example AppleScript code for use in an AppleScript script (.scpt) file manually assigned to the target folder using the Folder Action Setup... command from the Services context menu in Finder:\non adding folder items to thisFolder after receiving theseItems\n    repeat with i from 1 to count theseItems\n        try\n            set thisItem to item i in theseItems\n            set thisItemsPathname to quoted form of POSIX path of thisItem\n            do shell script \"/Users/jeffolaa/pointer.sh \" & thisItemsPathname\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: To use an AppleScript script (.scpt) file using the Folder Action Setup... command from the Services context menu in Finder, it first must be added to the ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts folder that's within your Home folder.       \n\n\nTo test the above code, I created the /Users/jeffolaa/pointer.sh file with the following code in it:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmv \"$1\" \"$HOME/Test/\"\n\nWhich simply moves the files back to the folder from which they were dragged from to the target folder the Folder Action is assigned to, which is a folder within the Test folder. This let me know it was working properly as coded.\n\n\nNow if it's just the name of the file you want to pass to pointer.sh, you can use the following:\nMinimal example AppleScript code for use in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Folder Action workflow:\non run {input, parameters}\n    repeat with i from 1 to count input\n        try\n            set thisItem to item i in input\n            set thisItemsInfo to info for thisItem\n            set thisItemsFileName to quoted form of name in thisItemsInfo\n            do shell script \"/Users/jeffolaa/pointer.sh \" & thisItemsFileName\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend run\n\nMinimal example AppleScript code for use in an AppleScript script (.scpt) file manually assigned to the target folder using the Folder Action Setup... command from the Services context menu in Finder:\non adding folder items to thisFolder after receiving theseItems\n    repeat with i from 1 to count theseItems\n        try\n            set thisItem to item i in theseItems\n            set thisItemsInfo to info for thisItem\n            set thisItemsFileName to quoted form of name in thisItemsInfo\n            do shell script \"/Users/jeffolaa/pointer.sh \" & thisItemsFileName\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: To use an AppleScript script (.scpt) file using the Folder Action Setup... command from the Services context menu in Finder, it first must be added to the ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts folder that's within your Home folder.\n\n\nTo test the above code, I edited the pointer.sh file with the following code in it:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsay \"$1\"\n\nWhich simply says the name of the file held in thisItemsFileName, which let me know it was working properly as coded.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code above is just that, and sans wrapping it in a try statement, does not include any other error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted, the onus is upon the user to add any appropriate error handling for any example code presented and or code written by the oneself.\nThat said, if you'd update your question to fill in the missing pieces as mentioned in the opening paragraphs of my answer, I'll be glad to edit these code examples to reflect what appropriate error handling should be added. There's just no sense adding it until I know the particulars.\n\nA: Managed to resolve my blocker thanks to some amazing suggestions from @user34393894.\nInstead of using Automator I was able to get the outcome I needed through an AppleScript script attached as a Folder Action.\nFor anyone interested the code I'm now using which is getting great results is:\non adding folder items to thisFolder after receiving theseItems\nrepeat with i from 1 to count theseItems\n    try\n        set thisItem to item i in theseItems\n        set thisItemsInfo to info for thisItem\n        set thisItemsFileName to quoted form of name in thisItemsInfo\n\n        tell application \"System Events\" -- get item info\n            set theKind to kind of thisItem\n            set theExtension to name extension of thisItem\n        end tell\n\n        if theKind is \"Folder\" then\n            -- do folder stuff\n        else if theExtension is \"mp3\" then\n\n            do shell script \"/Users/jeffolaa/ReplaceName.sh \" & thisItemsFileName\n\n        end if          \n    end try\nend repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\nIf anyone has any feedback or builds on the code that would be greatly appreciated, always looking to improve! \n", "Q: Broken terminal I've got this message in Terminal.app at startup\ndyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/gdbm/lib/libgdbm.4.dylib\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/zsh\n  Reason: image not found\n\n[Process completed]\n\nI have found some links regarding this issue.\nBut the problem is that I can't run terminal app, so it's not possible for me to try brew doctor or other options.\nIt's not possible to reinstall Terminal app, other terminal app (iTerm2) is not running at all.\nIs there a way to fix this problem without reinstalling OSX?\n\nA: Easier I think:\nDownload iTerm2 and\nbrew update && brew upgrade zsh worked for me ;-)\n\nA: Are you running zsh?

But when I’m at 29GB, the truth is I don’t have 3GB available because the true storage is just about 29GB.\nHow do I see true storage size?\n\nA: That is the true storage size, its just that App Data needs some space to fluctuate as you continue to use them. iOS is about 2GB total (average).\n", "Q: Prevent menu bar from dropping down while in fullscreen Though the menu bar is hidden in fullscreen, mousing to the top makes it drop down.

I use iTerm for doing things such as creating passwords by selecting random words from /usr/dict.  I prefix the commands with a space so they aren't saved in the shell history.  I discovered to my horror that iTerm2 keeps recent paste, commands and other history.  See Session > Open Paste / command / ....  Its all there in plain text sqlite db file.\nI found that these are saved to ~/Library/Application\\ Support/iTerm2/ and I simply deleted these files.  However this is not a very good solution since everything is deleted and has to be done every time.\nMy questions are - is this data saved anywhere else and is there a way to create secure sessions so this doesn't happen?  \n\nA: Ahhh, it seems that Terminal (MacOSX Default app) doesn't save such data anywhere (at least under ~/Library/Application\\ Support/)?  So my answer is how to have secure sessions (generally).  But it doesn't answer if iTerm2 does this anywhere else nor how to create 'secure sessions' (one where the commands aren't saved) using it.\nThis is my answer though I welcome anything better.\n", "Q: How can I get access to menu bar item in Bartender 3 using AppleScript? For the software on the top-right menu bar, I can use the following AppleScript to access the menu bar items like this\nactivate application \"SystemUIServer\"\nset deviceName to \"Somebody’s AirPods\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n        set bluetoothMenu to (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 whose description contains \"bluetooth\")\n        tell bluetoothMenu\n            click\n\n            set deviceMenuItem to (menu item deviceName of menu 1)\n            tell deviceMenuItem\n                click\n\n                if exists menu item \"Connect\" of menu 1 then\n                    click menu item \"Connect\" of menu 1\n                    return \"Connecting...\"\n                else\n                    set batteryLevelMenuItem to (menu item 3 of menu 1)\n                    tell batteryLevelMenuItem\n                        set batteryLevelText to title of batteryLevelMenuItem\n                    end tell\n\n                    key code 53 -- esc key\n\n                    return batteryLevelText\n                end if\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis AppleScript helps me connect to my AirPods. But if I put the bluetooth item into Bartender 3, it doesn't work. What should I add into the codes to get access to item in Bartender?\n\nA: I'm gathering from your wording that you want to access a menu item of Bartender 3 that sits in the menu bar in much the same way as my Dropbox app does:\n\nHopefully I've this you correctly, not having Bartender myself.  However, figuring out how to access the menu item using AppleScript is not too difficult.  As you've been doing already, we'll use GUI scripting to do this, so make sure Script Editor has permission to control your computer under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility (MacOS High Sierra).\nBecause I don't have Bartender myself, I need you do do some detective work in AppleScript for me (but it's good practice, as it shows you how to solve problems like this in the future):\nPart 1: Accessing the Menu Icon\nRun this command:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get every process whose name contains \"bartender\"\n\nI ran a similar command for \"dropbox\" and it returned this:\n    --> {application process \"Dropbox\", \n         application process \"DropboxActivityProvider\"}\n\nI imagine Bartender will have one or two processes at most as well.  One of them is probably called \"Bartender\".  Choose that one, unless the other one has an obviously helpful name, such as \"BartenderMenu\" (I doubt it).\nNow run this, substituting in the appropriate process name (which is case-sensitive):\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Bartender\" to get every menu bar\n\nHopefully, it returns this:\n    --> {menu bar 1 of application process \"Bartender\" of application \"System Events\", \n         menu bar 2 of application process \"Bartender\" of application \"System Events\"}\n\nmenu bar 1 is the menu bar containing the Apple Menu () in the top-left.  menu bar 2 (if it exists) will be the menu bar containing the application icon.\nNow you should be able to target that menu icon with this command:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Bartender\" to ¬\n    click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n\nHopefully that should sort you out.  For completeness, here's a one line job that gets all the menu bar apps in one go:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get menu bar 2 of every process\n\nIt will return an arrange, most of whose items will be missing value (representing processes that don't have a second menu bar—the only ones that do are menu bar apps).  In amongst those missing values will be the names of apps that sit up top, and you can probably just pick out \"Bartender\" (or whatever it'll be called) straight away using this method.\nPart 2: Accessing the Menu and its Menu Items\nIf, when you normally click the menu app icon for Bartender, it displays a menu, then you'll want to know how to access those menu items from AppleScript as well.\nThe menu itself doesn't come into existence until the icon has been clicked and the menu appears.  The menu itself is (or will be) called menu 1.  Its individual menu items are called menu items and referenced by their name (which is the text of the menu item itself, e.g. \"Quit Bartender 3\").\nHere's the command that will access the menu:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Bartender\" to ¬\n    get menu items of menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n\nHowever, you need to bring the menu into existence first, otherwise it will just throw an error or return missing value.  Therefore, run the command to click the menu app icon first, then run that one:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Bartender\" to ¬\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n        click\n        get menu items of menu 1\n    end tell\n\nAnd, similarly, you can issue a click command to a menu item of your choice by referencing its name:\nclick menu item \"Quit Bartender 3\" of menu 1\n\n(suitably enclosed in the relevant tell statements/blocks).\nFinally: That Annoying Delay\nAnnoyingly, there'll be a 5-second delay between issuing a click command and retrieving the list of menu items.  I don't know why, but I do know it's a standard issue that other users report.  Here's the issue raised over on Stack Overflow together with someone's alleged fix for the problem (I haven't tested this myself).\nAny questions or problems, leave a comment and I'll do my best to help.\n", "Q: Accidentally plugged in earphone jack into USB port! So I wanted to plug in my earphone jack into my Mac but I was not seeing so I accidentally and gently without that much force I put in my earphone jack into my  Mac left usb port but it did not touch the pins. So should I worry that I have damaged my Mac?\n\nA: I wouldn't worry too much, the only two pins on a USB port that might have an ill effect if you short them together are the ground and power pins but they're located at either end of the connector so it's unlikely that would have happened with an earphone jack.\nAdditionally USB ports have over-current protection which is why from time to time you might see a message similar to \"USB device was drawing too much power - USB devices have been disabled\". In that case a reboot should re-enable the port. So unless you've physically damaged the connector, which it doesn't sound like you have, I don't see you'll have a problem.\nJust to add a reference regarding shorting of pins from a publicly available standard, the Universal Serial Bus Revision 2.0 specification, sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1.2.1:\nShort Circuit Withstand\n\nA USB transceiver is required to withstand a continuous short circuit of D+ and/or D- to VBUS, GND, other data line, or the cable shield at the connector, for a minimum of 24 hours without degradation. It is recommended that transceivers be designed so as to withstand such short circuits indefinitely. The device must not be damaged under this short circuit condition when transmitting 50% of the time and receiving 50% of the time (in all supported speeds)...\n\nOver-current Protection\n\nThe host and all self-powered hubs must implement over-current protection for safety reasons, and the hub must have a way to detect the over-current condition and report it to the USB software. Should the aggregate current drawn by a gang of downstream facing ports exceed a preset value, the over-current protection circuit removesor reduces power from all affected downstream facing ports...\n\n", "Q: macOS: lossless PNG to PDF conversion I have several pages imported from scanner in PNG format. I use image editor to clean some noise, downscale to 100PDI, convert image palette to grayscale, etc. Finally I've got a bunch of PNG images of small size, looking good at computer screen still.\nThen I need to save these PNG pages to a single PDF file for distribution. Earlier I was able to achieve this using Preview.app. However in macOS X High Sierra 10.13 this approach does not work any longer because Preview.app is trying to downscale PNG images by 30% to fit page size.

You should use img2pdf if your priorities are (in this order):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*always lossless: the image embedded in the PDF will always have the exact same color information for every pixel as the input\n  \n*small: if possible, the difference in filesize between the input image and the output PDF will only be the overhead of the PDF container itself\n  \n*fast: if possible, the input image is just pasted into the PDF document as-is without any CPU hungry re-encoding of the pixel data\n  \n  \n  Conventional conversion software (like ImageMagick) would either:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*not be lossless because lossy re-encoding to JPEG\n  \n*not be small because using wasteful flate encoding of raw pixel data\n  \n*not be fast because input data gets re-encoded\n  \n  \n  Another advantage of not having to re-encode the input (in most common situations) is, that img2pdf is able to handle much larger input than other software, because the raw pixel data never has to be loaded into memory.\n\nThis is a free/libre and small python tool with minimal dependencies. If you already have pip installed then a simple pip3 install img2pdf takes care of 'getting it'.\nUsage is then straightforward:\n$ img2pdf img1.png img2.jpg -o out.pdf\n\nDepending on your habits, you type img2pdf in Terminal, you can then select all your PNGs in Finder and just drag&drop them into the Terminal window, add the -oand add the desired name for the output file.\n\nA: On MacOS versions from Leopard (10.5) to Catalina (11), the Images to PDF Quick Action here will convert all selected images to one PDF document, without fitting to a page size or resampling the image.\nOn newer versions of the OS, you'll need to install python3 and use the script here, either as a standalone shell script (and the image files as arguments); or in an Automator or Shortcuts.app \"Run Shell Script\" action.\nYou can also use a script written in Swift in Monterey and later, though they are a bit slow compared to python.\n", "Q: I removed the passcode from my iPhone before repair, has my data been compromized? Few days back I gave my iPhone 6 to a shop to change the battery. The person asked me to remove the passcode so that he can check the battery status. I collected the iPhone later when the battery was fixed. \nBut now I think it was not a smart thing to do to remove my passcode and give the phone to someone else. I am now worried that he might possibly taken the backup of my iPhone to his iTunes and then restore it into a another iPhone. Will he get all my data in another iPhone?\nIs there anything I can do now to prevent this?\n\nA: Apple’s own advice for keeping data secure during repair:\nFor Macs: Keeping your confidential data secure during hardware repair\n\nWhen your hard drive is replaced, the previous hard drive is returned\nto Apple and refurbished. As part of the refurbishment process, Apple\nerases and reformats all hard drives to help address any concerns\nabout data security or identity theft.\nYou might send your computer\nfor repair when the hard disk is still working—either the drive works\nintermittently or your hard drive isn't the issue requiring repair. If\nyou are concerned about data security and your hard disk is still\nfunctioning, you should back up your important data and use the secure\nerase functions in Disk Utility (described below) to reformat your\ndrive before sending in your computer for service.\nSecure erase functions in Disk Utility\nYour erase options depend on which version of OS X you have on your computer.\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X v10.4 and later includes additional secure erase options in Disk Utility. Note: With OS X Lion v10.7 or later and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for SSD because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault encryption when you start using an SSD. FileVault, available in Mac OS X v10.3 and later, prevents others from easily accessing any information contained within your Home folder, even if the drive unexpectedly stops working or is serviced.\n\n*Mac OS X v10.3.x and earlier include a\nZero all Data function in Disk Utility that you can use to completely\nerase the drive.\n\nAlways remember to make a backup of your important\ndata before using any erase or encryption options, as any rewriting of\ndata includes a risk of data loss.\nFor iOS devices: Get your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch ready for\nservice\nBefore you bring in your device\nFollow these steps before you take your device to an Apple Store,\nApple Authorized Service Provider, or carrier. If your device won't\nturn on or respond, finish as many steps as possible:\n\n*\n\n*Back up your iOS device.\n\n*Have your Apple ID password ready. For some repairs, you'll need your Apple ID password to erase your device and turn off Find My\niPhone.*\n\n*Bring your sales receipt (if possible), in case your service requires proof of purchase.\n\n*Bring your device and any accessories that you need help with.\n\n*Bring a form of personal identification, like a driver’s license, passport, or other government-issued ID.\n\n*If you haven't already, call to check whether you need an appointment before you go to a service location. For example, schedule\na Genius Bar reservation before you go to an Apple Store.\n\nBefore you send your device\nFollow these steps before you send your device in for repair or\nreplacement. If it won't turn on or respond, finish as many steps as\npossible:\n\n*\n\n*If you need to send in an iPhone that's paired with an Apple Watch, unpair your devices. When you unpair, your iPhone will create a new\nbackup of your Apple Watch. You can use the backup to restore your\nApple Watch when your iPhone returns from service.\n\n*Back up your iOS device.\n\n*Go to Settings > Messages and turn off iMessage.\n\n*Erase your device. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. If asked, enter your passcode and Apple ID\npassword. If you can't erase your device because it won't power on or\nisn't responding, you can erase it from iCloud.com. Learn how.\n\n*Make sure that Activation Lock is disabled.\n\n*Remove any SIM card, case, or screen protector from your device and keep your cable and charger.\n\n\n\nA: You should consider all device content compromised and it is too late to be prevented.\nBy removing the passcode, any new computer the device is connected to can be ‘trusted’ without any further authentication. The device can be backed up to iTunes and all the device content available to browse through or be restored to a new device.\nIf the backup was created ‘encrypted’ this includes all passwords on the device which may include your Apple ID password.\nYou should change any passwords which are linked to the device, such as Apple ID and email account passwords.\n", "Q: What is ATTOcelebrity.kext?

If I delete the one in iCloud Storage, will it also be deleted from the iCloud Backup?\n\n\n\nA: Deleting one does not affect the other as they are backups of different types.\n\n\n*\n\n*The backup in iCloud Backup (first screenshot) is a backup of the contents of the app container on your iPhone. This is backed up every night as your iCloud Backup takes place, or manually when you Back Up Now.\n\n*The ‘backup’ in iCloud Storage (second screenshot) is a backup created by WhatsApp using WhatsApp Settings → Chats → Chat Backup. This is backed up at most per the interval set in WhatsApp settings, or manually when you Back Up Now.\nIt is up to you which backup you choose to keep. Personally I would use WhatsApp own backup service with iCloud rather than iCloud Backup.\n\nA: You might want to keep in mind that when backing up WhatsApp via the second option as explained by grg – the iCloud Storage way – then those backups will trigger all of your Macs with iCloud Drive turned on to sync that WhatsApp data to a hidden file on macOS and affect your storage space on those devices, your bandwidth and in case of laptops your battery life as well (https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/237207/54388).\n", "Q: Cannot partition internal drive to install bootcamp because of APFS/High Sierra When I run Boot Camp Assistant, the attempted installation of Windows 10 fails, giving me the error \"An error occurred while partitioning the disk.\" Have already tried First Aid on both my macOS boot volume and in recovery mode. Also tried /sbin/fsck -fy in single user mode. Both didn't work. \nHere's the catch - when I make my own partition on my internal disk via Disk Utility (recovery mode and boot volume Disk Utility both have the same result) the partition will fail if I set the partition for over 15 GB. When I make a partition (not APFS container) that is 15 GB or less, Disk Utility will make it without problems. When I attempt to make a partition over 15 GB, the process will fail.\nNow, A few days ago, I restored a Time Machine backup of my entire main internal drive via recovery mode and turns out that after that restore Macintosh HD reverted back to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) instead of APFS. After said restore and my internal disk being HFS, Boot Camp Assistant was fully successful in installing Windows 10. So I know that (hopefully) that process will work again if I want to install Boot Camp again. Since then, I deleted the BOOTCAMP partition and deleted Windows from my MacBook Pro (why I did that is a complicated story). I now want to re-install Windows 10.\nHowever, I have an additional Time Machine backup of a clean High Sierra install which I restored to an additional APFS container on my internal disk just before writing this. When restored, this backup did not revert back to HFS after the restore, which in turn means bootcamp assistant/disk partitioning for 15 GB+ failed. I'm willing to restore the backup of my entire main drive from before all these shenanigans started in an attempt to get APFS to accept a partition, but I would like to know more options.\nThe main point - What are my other options to force APFS/High Sierra to accept a partition of greater than 15 GB and/or make Boot Camp Assistant actually go through with it's job. I’m open to all options to solve this problem. High Sierra has a lot of bugs in it and they're getting on my nerves. Apple needs to up their QC.\nAnyways thanks to everyone for reading/helping me out - much appreciated :) \n\nA: If your disk has been converted/formatted to use APFS, and you use Time Machine partitioning will typically fail because Time Machine made local APFS snapshots.\nYou can see the snapshots created with the command (use Terminal to enter it):\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nIf you see some, run the following command:\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 9999999999999\n\nThis last command will delete all the local snapshots.\nNow run the Bootcamp assistant again, this time partitioning the disk should succeed.\n", "Q: How do I change the name of an album in Photos on my Mac How do I change the name of an album in Photos my Mac? \n\nA: *\n\n*Select name of album in the sidebar\n\n*Click on the name again to edit\n\n*Or: click on album name at the top of the pictures to edit\n\n", "Q: Freehand drawings on PDF with Preview not showing up This feature used to work fine. I just tried to use the sketch/freehand tool in Preview to annotate a PDF and while the little \"pen point\" shows up in blue, the area I sketch remains blank, with only the parameters of the sketch showing (those little dots that show the size of the annotation). \nI've made sure that my background color is set to nothing.The little vertical tab that turns up under the Aa on the far left shows the doodle, but clicking on the various options does not reveal the doodle on my PDF. Right clicking on the doodle area offers the option \"Send to back,\" not \"Send to front.\" \nI am running Sierra 10.12.6 on an iMac.\nHow can I get this to work properly?\n\nA: This happened to me too, so I ended up exporting the document as PNG or jpg to preserve the annotation--obviously not a feasible solution if your document is more than a couple of pages long. \n", "Q: Configuration profile reinstalls itself after I delete it A few days ago, a configuration profile disguised as an app called TweakBox, popped up on my brother's MacBook.

This app/configuration profile does absolutely nothing, but it's annoying to have it pop up continuously. How can I remove it from both MacOS and iOS?\n\nA: Good news is it's not a virus.\nBad news is it sounds like he's been trying to install some hacked/cracked apps! https://www.tweakboxapp.com\nSo you'll need to remove the TweakBox App (from home screen) and the TweakBox Profile (Settings > General > Profiles) that is installing it.

This has worked before.\nWhat I found when I got home is that all the photos seemed to have the same location (which was slightly southeast of any location I photographed).\nI'm wondering if the iPhone camera is now either rounding off geographic coordinates to a lower precision, or giving all photos taken around the same place and same time the same coordinates, or both, and if so, if this is particular to the Camera app or universal to all apps using the camera.\nExtra info\nThis is on an iPhone 6s running 11.2.1. When I've done this before, it would have been on an iPhone 5 running whatever version of iOS would have been current circa January 2016.\n\nA: Check the GPS time on your photos. This is the time of the GPS fix used to tag your photos. I.e. the time at which iPhone determined your location. It is possible that your iPhone failed to get a GPS fix while you were photographing. In that case it can decide to use the last known location. You would find that all your photos share the same GPS time.\nMany possible reasons: High buildings, narrow streets, etc. can sometimes impair GPS reception. The iPhone GPS could have had a software problem that was later resolved by restarting the phone. Your iPhone may have been on low power mode.\nI recently hiked Kilimanjaro and had set my iPhone to low power mode while on the mountain. It seems this had the effect of iPhone powering up the GPS much less frequently. I have photos where the GPS fix predates the photo by several hours. \nI also saw what I consider to be a bug: iPhone seems to have discarded more recent GPS fixes in favor of better (but older) fixes. I have a few situations where one photo has a rather recent GPS fix and photos taken hours later were tagged with a GPS fix from the previous day!\n", "Q: SSH tunneling with Safari I am transition from Windows to OS X: Can one configure the Safari browser with a socks to tunnel through a SSH tunnel (Putty in MS-Windows).

Once that's open, type: \n  ssh -D 8080 -C -N username@IpAddress \n\nnote to understand all options for ssh simply type man ssh in a new terminal window. The options used above -D binds the port to the IP, -C compresses the data, -N will not execute commands in the tunnel which is very useful for forwarding other application data through the tunnel. \nNext open safari and click on \"safari\" in the top left menu bar to open the drop down menu and then click on preferences. You can do the same thing by pressing CMD+,. Click on the advanced tab and find \"Proxies\", click \"Change Settings\". System Preferences should open and you can now select \"SOCKS Proxy\". You should be setup and if you check google for your IP it should be masked by the address that you're SSH'd into. Note this is system wide and will cover all network communications. You can turn this off by unselecting the SOCKS Proxy. \n", "Q: When I receive a phone call now, my MacBooks always open up FaceTime and do not allow me to take the call! This started happening a few weeks ago. I just want the old functionality back again, it looks like this: \n\nNow, when I receive a call, FaceTime.app starts, my camera's green led comes on (due to FaceTime's preview) and I cannot even accept the call.\nIt seems possible that turning on WiFi calling on my Mac caused this change in behavior. \nI would really like to understand what went wrong here. \n\nA: I think what's going on is that with my 2017 Touchbar MBP the only way to take the call is to use the touchbar. This worked for me today.\nNext time I will see what happens with the Macbook, which has no touchbar. \n", "Q: Move Calendar event to Reminders? I have some events on my Calendar that I would prefer to have listed in Reminders.  (They were added to the Calendar by TurboTax.)  Is there a simple way to move them from one app to another?  (I'm using Mac OS 10.11.6.) \n\nA: This seems to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your calendar.\n\n*Click on the event you want to move to Reminders.\n\n*Copy the event (⌘ command+C).\n\n*In the Reminders app, click in a new event line.\n\n*Paste the event (⌘ command+V).\n\n\nThere are a couple things I noticed when testing this (on Mac OS Sierra, 10.12.6):\n\n\n*\n\n*The title of the reminder matches the name of the calendar event, but it's followed by \"Scheduled:\".\n\n*If the calendar event contains any alerts prior to the time of the event, these alerts are not added to the reminder.  The reminder is only for the actual time of the event.\n\n\nA: An alternative way to work around this limitation of OS X / macOS is by drag and drop.\n\n*\n\n*Open Calendar and Reminders.\n\n*Display the Reminders list to where you want to create the item.\n\n*Select the event in Calendar and drag it into the list itself.\n\nThe only upside with this method would appear to be that you create a link from the reminder to the event in your Calendar schema and date and time at the point creation is visible in Reminder. However, this is probably of limited use as if you reschedule the event this info text is not updated and the link doesn't seem to update either if you change the date. So I'd view this more of saving the user a few key presses at best — sometimes with a lot of info that really helps — and maybe getting some logging info on the original scheduled date. Seemingly there is not more info than the copy paste method as suggested by @Alan Kinnaman.\nIt would be much nicer if you could drag and drop also a Reminder to the Calendar, but this doesn't seem to be possible.\nLikely the best way to connect Reminders and Calendar is to use an app that is backed by their stores and do link these in its own way. If such apps exist. There are at least apps that integrate calendar and tasks, but if these are backed by the Calendar and Reminder app stores needs to be investigated.\n\nA: Sometimes looking for a way for the System to accomplish small things -  especially now with High Sierra having been trimmed of so many useful “small things” - it makes more sense to copy and paste your Calendar event title to a new Reminder, and fill in the details yourself. \nOr search the web. \nI find Apple Support very low on advice, mostly a repeat of uninformative Support pages. There are great utilities like Onyx and Cocktail which help with sensible system tweaks.\n", "Q: if i get a new phone but same phone number, will i get the sent but undelivered messages people have sent me? Im buying a new iphone and getting a number on it:\nHere's the deal, i lost my phone and ever since then when somebody sends me messages it appears as sent but not delivered (only 1 check) now, if i get a new phone and start whatsapp on it with the same phone number, will i get those messages?\nThose messages really matter and i would like to know if its worth doing all the process to get back the same number \n\nA: As long as it hasn't been 30 days since you lost your phone, you will receive all pending messages. But if it has been more then 30 days, you will not receive those messages, as WhatsApp deletes them from their servers.\nFrom WhatsApp's FAQ:\n\n...undelivered messages are deleted from our servers after 30 days.\n\nOn a side note, if it has been over two months since you lost the phone, then it's as if you're a new user on WhatsApp, and you will be removed from all of your WhatsApp groups.\n", "Q: What options for clean install of MacOS High Sierra after permanent error message? I have a late 2012 iMac i7 16GB RAM and 1TB FusionDrive which I want to sell. Using the Disk Utilities in Recovery Mode, I erased all data on the Macintosh HD partition. I then went on and selected reinstall MacOS High Sierra in the recovery mode, which failed a couple of times (no progress for hours) and after several tries it showed Mountain Lion (instead of High Sierra before) as the OS to be installed. I tried this as well, but the installation process froze after about 7 hours with \"3 hour remaining\". Then, I created a USB bootable installer for High Sierra. When booting the iMac and pressing the option key, I am presented this USB drive as startup option, and when I select it I end up in the recovery mode window again with the option to reinstall High Sierra. The installation takes about 5 minutes and in the very last second I receive an error message \"An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again\".\nWhat options do I have from here?\nNote: I already checked the system date, which is current. I checked if there's a recovery partition, and there is a Apple_Boot partition but without the usual name (\"Recovery HD\"). There are no disk / partition errors when running verify / repair.\n\nA: I finally made it work. It must have had something to do with an encryption I had set up for the FusionDrive previously. \nSOLUTION:\nI deleted the Logical Volume Group which resulted in 2 separate 'untitled' drives, i.e. one SSD and one larger HDD drive. I then combined those drives again to form the FusionDrive. After that, I installed the original OS X Mountain Lion via web recovery, installed the High Sierra upgrade via the App Store, and then went back to the recovery mode to erase the volume again and install the High Sierra OS from there. Now I have a clean High Sierra preinstalled iMac, as intended.\nI would like to use this opportunity to thank all of you for your support, which was extremely helpful for me in finding the ultimate problem solution!!   \n\nA: It sounds like you might have a failing hard drive.  Boot from an external hard drive and use a utility like DriveDx (free download with 15 day free trial) to check for errors.  This utility does a much more thorough scan than Disk Utility.\n", "Q: iTunes store purchased media items: usability in another country?

NOTE:  This is not a global Amazon problem but intermittent.  It happens to only SOME items, but those items it happens consistently. It happens only with Safari and only on the Amazon site.\n\n*I reported both to Apple and Amazon and no joy.  No answers!  What's up?\nNow, I am forced to use Firefox or Chrome if I want to buy things from Amazon. This has never been an issue before the OS upgrade.\nIs this a problem others are facing or perhaps a Safari setting (content block etc) on my behalf?\n\nA: Introduction\nTo start with, I can verify that, when viewed in Safari, the content of the Amazon website displays correctly. I am a frequent user (and from your wording of the problem, it sounds like you are too) of their services and have undergone the macOS upgrade (through every version of the High Sierra releases) myself several months ago.\nBefore or after the upgrade, I have not witnessed any of the problems you describe in the question.\nThis got me thinking that it is most likely an internet, Safari Settings or Location problem as certain content can only be served under certain conditions, e.g. your physical location.\nAnalysis\nLet's begin to eliminate a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*As you mention that this has occurred after the macOS upgrade (which brought with it a new version of Safari - 11.0) and all was fine before the upgrade, I am almost certain that your physical location (determined by your IP address) is not to blame.\n\n*I doubt it is an internet issue (as it appeared instantly since the upgrade), which could cause the website content (i.e. the scripts that serve you the dynamic content such as Amazon listings) to fail intermittently. Visual feedback of such would include very long load times and frequently unrendered website data.\n\n*That leaves us with the Safari Preferences and content blockers you may have enabled. Based on my earlier observation that everything displays as usual when I access the website, I would like you to check your own Safari Preferences: Safari -> Preferences for the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security Tab: Check that Enable JavaScript is checked.\n\n*Websites Tab: Go to Content Blocker and remove any Amazon entries from the list. Next, click on  Location and ensure that no Amazon entries are set to deny. If you scroll down in the sidebar on the left (where you also found Content Blocker and Location), you find Plug-ins, uncheck any that you haven't heard of.\n\n*Extensions Tab: Ensure that no extensions added by you (such as AdBlock Plus) prevent content on Amazon from loading. Whitelisting Amazon's website is recommended.\n\n*Advanced Tab: Select Proxies and ensure that no proxies or VPN tunnels are set, giving Amazon a reason to hinder access.\n\n*Privacy Tab: Ensure that Block all cookies is unchecked - Amazon required them.  You can further delete all Amazon cookies in case Cookie corruption occurred.\nGo to: Privacy Tab click on Manage Website Data... and use the provided search field in the top right-hand corner to search for amazon then click Remove All. This next time you visit the Amazon website, everything is as though you have never been there before, simply log in again and the data you deleted in the previous step (cookies) will be regenerated. This method may prove to be a key step in solving your problem as cookie corruption (although uncommon) has been known to happen between browser upgrades from time to time.\n\n\n\nCookies essentially store website information between sessions to\n  allow you to get back to where you left off much quicker.\n\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, the issue (from what I am gathering) is with your installation of Safari 11. At this time, the latest version is 11.0.2, is this what you have or are there further updates you have not yet installed?\nAlthough I think my answer pretty much covers the essentials, you can read up on resetting Safari if the problem persists. Let me know if that makes sense and definitly how you get on.\n\nA: There is one more Safari Preference that you should check, on the \"Websites\" tab.\nMake sure \"page zoom\" is not set above 100% for Amazon.\n", "Q: Do All of the Macbook Pros Have That GPU-Kernel Panic Issue? Recently I upgraded my mid-2010 MacBook Pro from Snow Leopard to Yosemite. Everything seemed to be working just fine, and then, a few hours later, the kernel panics started.\nThankfully, I was able to find the solution here:\nQuestion about GPU Panic on Mid 2010 MacBookPro6,2\nNow I am thinking about upgrading that MacBook Pro to a newer model, but I just saw somebody on here talking about having a similar issue with their 2016 MacBook Pro, hence my question.\nSo newer MacBook Pros have the same problem?\n\nA: AFAIK there have been no widespread reports of kernel panics due to GPU related issues on 2017 MacBook Pro 15\", and I doubt there are any. There's always some quantity that have hardware issues, but nothing outside of the norm. According to Apple, the issues with the 2016 version were software related and patched in 10.12.2.\nWith that said, the norm doesn't seem to have a brilliant track record; for whatever reason, GPU failure seems to be medicore across their products. Here's a short list that I know of:\n\n\n*\n\n*All 2011 MacBook Pros\n\n*Mid 2012 and Early 2013 15\" MacBook Pros\n\n*2011 27\" iMac\n\n*Late 2013 Mac Pro\nThat said, if any widespread issues are present, they probably won't begin to show up in wide numbers until some time this year. Widespread reports of GPU failure in the 2011 MacBook Pro didn't really garner support until 2013 with Apple doing nothing centralized until 2015.\nThough, Apple (generally) is known for good support, and I wouldn't worry too much about this.\n", "Q: How to Add Ringtones for iPhone X Do you know how you can add ringtones to your iPhone?

The remote host can be Linux or Mac. So I need a command which returns the cpu/memory usage as output. I have found the command for Linux which is vmstat. But I couldn't find a good one for Mac. I know there is one command vm_stat on mac but it only returns memory usage. Is there a command for CPU usage as well? I have searched that most people use top. But top is good at monitoring and it would be hard to parse the result if I analyze its output in my program. I want to use one shipped with MacOS not a third party library.\n\nA: If you are looking to capture the total utilized CPU and Memory for all process, you could use this command that is native to Macs:\nps -A -o %cpu,%mem | awk '{ cpu += $1; mem += $2} END {print cpu , mem}'\n\n", "Q: Restore specific Terminal history from .bash_sessions?

I want to leave my iPhone and iPad chargers always plugged under my desk (so I can just connect my device when I want to charge) but I'm worried that they shouldn't be plugged all the time.\n\nA: If we are talking about fire risk, it is negligible for official Apple chargers. Non-zero, but pretty close to zero. Low-cost knockoffs have a significantly higher fire and shock risk due to cheap parts and sketchy wiring; UL produced an article showing a 99% failure rate of counterfeit chargers.\nIf we are talking about electrical pull, it is also negligible. Less than 0.1 watts pulled when a phone is not plugged in. You could have more than 150 chargers plugged in and you'd still pull less than a 10-watt light bulb. A single charger costs less than 25 cents and produces 1.5 lbs of carbon emissions (I assumed a liberal 1kWh to calculate this) for a whole year of being plugged in without a phone attached.\nIt is still a waste of energy and a non-zero percent fire risk, but it's up to you whether those minuscule risks, costs, and pollution amounts are even worth the energy and time expended unplugging it when not in use.\n\nA: Leaving something plugged in all the time not only increases risk of fire / personal injury, but also increases the cost of the electricity bill. Obviously. \nIt is not worth the cost and risk to save a few seconds. If you want to consider convenience in more depth, you could consider using portable chargers or purchase an extension cable, plug your cables in, and switch it off until you require it to be used. \n", "Q: Smart folder using \"or\" search?

I have done at least 6 factory firmware resets with itunes, and am looking for any suggestions for other things to try.\n\nA: The battery is right up against the antenna and some delicate ribbon connectors that connect to it. It is possible that in the swapping of your battery you might have mis-seated it (at best) or damaged something (at worst).\nDid the antenna stop working after you changed the battery and that led you to bring it to a shop? Or was it already getting flaky before you opened it up?\nGiven that you said that it only worked for about 15 minutes, it is possible that it is either slightly out of place or the ribbon is damaged and the heat of the device is cause expansion/contraction which is causing the antenna to fail; i.e. after a few minutes of using the phone it heats up enough that the connection breaks. No guarantee that cooling it down would reestablish that faulty connection.\nAssuming you're comfortable opening the device given that you've already attempted the battery, you could look at loosening and then carefully tightening the antenna screws and see if that helps anything. Step 14 on the iFixit teardown guide gives a closeup of the antenna.\nThe inside of the phone is delicate and very sensitive to static electricity, things getting bumped, etc. Sure, they're always around static electricity but they're designed to mostly keep that stuff outside of the case. Regardless, given that you mention intermittent behavior you might be able to get away with wiggling / reseating the antenna to bring it back to life. Just make sure to be properly grounded first!\n", "Q: Can only use custom keyboard layout in certain apps? I'm using a MacBook Pro with MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.2.\nI used Ukelele to create a custom keyboard layout.

This CAC has ID certificates loaded onto it for security purposes and allows access to secure sites. There are different certificates for different sites.\nPrior to macOS v10.13.2 it worked flawlessly. Right after upgrading I attempted to use Safari like I normally do, and while I was banging away on buttons, a window popped up asking me something. In my haste, I just clicked clicked yes, and there starts my issue.\nI immediately realized that I had never seen that message before. Even the window it was in was a different gold color than I've seen before. I don't know exactly what it asked me, but I'm assuming that it was asking something about using one of those certificates as a default for accessing sites as a feature new to 10.13.2 as opposed to the previous version where I would have to choose from a list of certificates each time I attempted to access a site.\nNow, each time I try to access one of those sites, I get a window that says\n\n<com.apple.webkit.networking is attempting to authenticate the user>\n\nand asks for a passcode. Regardless of what I enter for the password, after pressing Enter, the window disappears and then reappears shortly thereafter asking the same question.

Sometimes, this will help override the macOS system settings. \n\nI also use this site for help: http://www.militarycaccard.us. It has good tips to get CACs and PIV cards working.\n\nA: it sounds like a phish that took your credentials and is now imbedded so deep into your system you don’t notice it. It’s throwing errors thus causing you to no longer access using old certs. because it has reconfigured certs. Reprogram card and base clean not wipe computer ( if you simply wipe it it will still be imbedded and whatever you transferred to hard drive the virus most likely came with it so when you reload you are essentially reloading virus which will start to grow until you are back to this point) as anything you were logged into ie accts passwords etc can and are most likely infected.

I have been attempting to install reFind since I need an ubuntu machine. My current issue has been that I apparently have SIP and that is messing up the installation. Has anyone found a way to bypass this issue?\n\nA: SIP would only be a problem if you wanted to install rEFInd to your macOS boot volume. This was the preferred way to install rEFInd and its predecessor rEFIt. Currently, rEFInd is usually installed ether in a FAT32 formatted EFI partition or a ~200 MB JHFS+ (Macintosh OS Extended) formatted partition. Choosing either of these types of partitions has the following advantages.\n\n\n*\n\n*You do not have to disable SIP to install rEFInd.\n\n*You can use the Startup Manager to set your Mac to default boot to rEFInd.\nInstalling to an EFI partition has the following pros and cons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: Since the partition is FAT32 formatted, you can manipulate the rEFInd files from Ubuntu.\n\n*Con: If Windows is installed and uses the EFI boot method, then you have to create a new ~200 MB partition just for rEFInd.\nInstalling to an JHFS+ partition has the following pros and cons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: You can add a label to the Startup Manager menu instead of the generic \"EFI Boot\" label.\n\n*Con: You can manipulate the rEFInd files from Ubuntu if you turn off journalling, but this still is not recommended.\nI should add that you do not need rEFInd to boot Ubuntu on your Mac. Your Mac can boot Ubuntu from the Startup Manager. This has the following pros and cons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: You do not need to install rEFInd.\n\n*Con: You have to manually copy some Grub/Ubuntu files to a location compatible with the Startup Manager. If an Ubuntu update changes these files, then you would be responsible for updating the copied files.\nYou also can use the bless command to set your Mac to boot Ubuntu as the default. You would have to execute this command from macOS Recovery or disable SIP.\nSome the questions, with an accepted answer, you might consider viewing are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Triple boot macOS High Sierra, Ubuntu, and Windows without rEFInd\n\n*Dual-Booting OS X or macOS with Linux without rEFInd\n\nA: SIP is not a problem. reFind installed fine on High Sierra for me.

Starting from 20 December, whatsapp complains that there is not enough space on the iphone to do a backup to icloud. Before this date, everything worked fine and I don't remember doing anything particular around that time.\nThe backup dimension is 2.37 Gb with 878 Mb of videos. Currently I have 8.2 Gb of free space on my phone (and 40 Gb on iCloud), but whatsapp complains that I should \"free 512 MB of space on the phone to do chat backup\".\nSo, I have two questions:\n1 - Why does the backup require any additional space at all? The 2.37Gb are already stored locally inside the whatsapp app; why would I need any additional space for the icloud backup?\n2 - Why does it require so much more space? Is there something wrong?\n\nA: Go to WhatsApp - Settings - Chats - Backup, and see how much space Whatsapp is trying to upload (you can choose to not include videos to reduce most of the size)\nNow, there are 2 Whatsapp backup switches to handle, they are both on by default, hence, by default, WhatsApp is an odd and inconvenient outlier since (compared to iCloud Photo library) it literally duplicates the space required if both switches are on, let me explain:\n1st switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > scroll down to see the switch (this switch creates a live backup that allows for an independent backup, meaning you don't need to restore your whole iphone to restore this backup, you can delete Whatsapp Only and said backup will be detected when you reinstall Whatsapp). You get to pick your frequency\n2nd switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > Manage Storage > click \"Backcup\" green icon row > Click your device > here you have a list of your TOTAL apps, each might save a tiny bit of settings info for each app (not the app itself), this is a packaged backup that also saves your downloaded app list (no matter if you switch off every app). So, Here you see WhatsApp too (2nd switch) <- if on, Whatsapp backup will take 2x space of your total iCloud space. As I understand, this backup can only be accessed if you restore the whole iPhone (whole package see). \nPost-context: for years, I've turned off the 2nd switch with no problems. But ever since iOS 13, background activity is a mess for Whatsapp, and even though I have more than enough space, auto-daily Whatsapp backup is not happening. I now have the question if I can invert the switches, and still be able to access WhatsApp backup by only deleting and reinstalling the whatsapp app, not the whole iPhone. This question arises since the packaged backup (2nd switch) for the rest of the apps (including WhatsApp) works flawlessly, daily, perfectly fine.\nTIP:: It doesn't matter if you have iCloud Photo library on on both sections, Apple is smart about this and only backcups once (only takes space one time), that's why I say WhatsApp is an inconvenient-odd outlier when it comes to both switches management.\nWith all this, maybe your backup is stuck since you have a 2.5Gb Whatsapp backup to be uploaded, which (if both switches on) requires 5Gb of free space. <- but in my case, not even having the double free space does the trick, auto-backup is not happening.\n\nA: It's a bug. I have the same issue:\nTotal Whatsapp data on my iPhone =  7GB\nFree space on iPhone             = 38GB\nWhatsapp complains that i have to free another 1,88GB to be able to make a backup of the chats to iCloud...\n", "Q: what are the implementations of openGL available for mac osX? OpenGL is the specifications standards for 2D , 3D graphics.\nAs of my little knowledge ,\nMesa3D is implementation for openGL on windows and linux platform.\nwhat about macOSX ? what are the implementations of openGL available for macosx?\n\nA: The OpenGL implementation for MacOS is MacOS — OpenGL support is built in. https://developer.apple.com/opengl/\n", "Q: Extract WhatsApp Backup Today, I found a phone I thought I had lost a few years ago (an iPhone 5s).\n I was wondering if I could extract the saved WhatsApp conversations from the iPhone to my PC and be able to read them?\nI don't have the same phone number anymore, so I don't know if I could use another number and restore my chats.\nIs there any way to extract those threads and read them? As it turns out, I also have them Backed up in iCloud, if that helps. \n\nA: Introduction\nThe problem lies with the fact that WhatsApp does not store a history of your chats on its servers (except undelivered ones). That means that unlike other messaging providers, WhatsApp cannot simply repopulate your chat history on every device because there is no central location (server) that stores them for you. While this is a great step towards privatizing your chats, this makes things all the more difficult for your case.\nAnalysis \n\n\n*\n\n*In early 2017, WhatsApp has encrypted its backups to iCloud, which means that if you lost your iPhone prior to\nthis, you may (optimistically) be able to read them in plain text.\nThis would probably require you to connect the iPhone via cable to a\nthird-party app on your Mac/PC like iPhone Explorer or\niExplorer. I used these years ago to extract files hidden in\nthe file system of an old iPhone 4. But I think it is saved to say\nthat there is absolutely no guarantee that you will even be able to\nopen any WhatsApp files you may find (due to encryption).\n\n*It seems to be entirely possible, however, to restore your current iPhone from the backup of the old one and view your messages that way. For what its worth, you are better off not risking your current chat threads, so do a backup of your current state. Therefore you can always restore it to today's version if things start to go wrong.\n\n*You may be interested in this article which discusses ways to transfer chat histories to other phones (Android, in case you switched to one - you didn't mention).\n\n\nConclusion\nBased on the (limited) options available to you, I'd recommend trying the second one first as you will have the greatest chance of actually reading the messages, compared to option one and three. Please read through this guide to learn how to restore your chat history. I am interested if it works for you. Let me know how you get on.\n", "Q: Can reminders have a custom location? Is it possible to move the location pin in the Reminders app, or otherwise set a custom location?  I want to set a reminder at a place with no address.\n(This is on an iPhone 7, so 3D Touch is available.)\n\nA: Introduction\nThe iOS Reminder application does not allow for free moving of the locator pin. The best you can get is entering the address of where to place it (logically), as most people want to be reminded when arriving at or leaving a pre-known location.\nPotential Alternatives \n\n\n*\n\n*While it is not possible to move the pin around on the map, you may\nfind that you can physically get to the location ahead of time and\nuse the Remind at Current Location option to set future reminders.\nObviously, this depends on the distance between you and that\nlocation, but if you use it frequently, you set up correctly once\ndon't worry about it again. This should be made easier with the next idea.\n\n*I would recommend that you use an app like Maps to get the exact\nlocation that you require and extract the address from it. If it is\na public space or company, this is often enough of a locational\nmarker to import straight into the Reminders app. This would be my\ngo to method.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe native Reminders app does not allow you to move the locator pin but perhaps 3rd party apps do, however this is beyond the scope of your question. If you are looking for more ways to use the Reminders app for location-based reminders, take a look at this article from Apple.\nI would be interested to know how you made out. Let me know.\n", "Q: Can I keep the OS as-is, on swapping SSD on compatible Macbooks? I own two Macbooks, an Air mid-2013 (256gb) and a Pro Early-2015 (128gb). As far as I know their ssd drives are the same model.\nThe question I would like to ask is: \nCan I take the SSD drive from the Air mid-2013 and install it inside the Pro early-2015 and use the OS, with all the data, as was installed on the original Mac? Or would I need to reinstall the OS on the newer Mac?\n\nA: Yes, you can replace it without reinstalling the OS and keep the data. \nThe only issue you can face is a long time first boot.\nBut I recommend you to backup both disks to external drive like a Time Capsule or external hard drive before replacing.\n\nA: Yes you can, sometimes it does mean you may need to apply firmware updates on the target machine before you do it if the OS is much newer than what the target was shipped with.\n", "Q: Moving imported photos to external drive I've been importing my DSLR photos using the standard Photos.app. Now I'm running out of HDD space. What's the best way to move my RAW photos to an external storage device?\n\nA: I was looking for an intuitive \"grandma could do it\" GUI solution, but I ended up doing:\nfind / -iregex '^.*\\.cr2$' -exec zip cr2.zip {} \\; -delete 2>/dev/null\n\nThen used the GUI to click & drag the .zip archive to the external USB HDD, mounted at /Volumes/disk2/. \nLooks like all the images imported directly from the DSLR are stored in ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/. So in hindsight; to target the specific directory, instead of searching the entire filesystem, I would input the relevant path:\nfind ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/ -iregex '^.*\\.cr2$' -exec zip cr2.zip {} \\; -delete 2>/dev/null\n\nOr even better, eliminate the need to click and drag by including the destination path as well:\nfind ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\\\n-iregex '^.*\\.cr2$'\\\n-exec zip /Volumes/disk2/cr2.zip {} \\;\\\n-delete 2>/dev/null\n\n\nOr simply mv rather than zip:\nfind ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\\\n-iregex '^.*\\.cr2$'\\\n-exec mv {} \\; /Volumes/disk2/ 2>/dev/null\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for cascading multiple windows of same application in macOs Need to know,\nIs there any app, which gives a keyboard shortcut Or any inbuilt keyboard shortcut\nto cascade windows(attached pic for reference) of same in application in macOs\nNote that I'm not asking about Expose shortcut\n\n\nA: Apparently if you hold the \"Option\" key wile selecting \"Arrange In Front\" from the Window menu of your application, that should do what you want. To make a shortcut for that, you should be able to add a shortcut in the keyboard preferences.\nYou might also look into Better Touch Tool\n\nA: I use Application windows shortcut for this.

The ATV4, with the latest tvOS, uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wifi to establish a Conference Room Display connection from an Airplay-enabed device (laptop, iPad, etc.)\nNaturally, Bluetooth's limited range makes it impossible to connect with AirPlay from the presenter's lectern on-stage, being almost 150' distant from the ATV4. One can connect when in range of the ATV4, and then move the AirPlay-enabled device to the lectern, but that is extremely non-optimal.\nI've searched for quite a while on how to disable this function, but it doesn't seem to be possible. I've also searched for Bluetooth extender devices, but they seem be designed to extend audio connections to BT headphones & whatnot.\nHas anybody figured out how to disable the peer-to-peer Bluetooth AirPlay configuration and use just Wi-fi?\n\nA: The difficulty was manifold, and combined a misconfigured wifi network, ATV4s not at the latest version of tvOS, and a management profile with an out-of-date certificate. Once these obstacles were overcome, the need to connect with Bluetooth was made moot.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015): SSD replacement I would like to replace my 256GB storage with a drive having more space, and not less efficient in terms of read/write speed.

But I am not sure if MacBook uses standard interface for this purpose. \nSo my question is, which drives/memory chips are compatible with my laptop model? Which hardware interface should I look for?\nAlso I guess that I need some specific toolkit to replace SSD, right? At least, to open laptop's back lid.\n\nA: Ok, thanks to @nekomatic and @GioValerio. I guess that one of JetDrive 820 drives should be sufficient for my purposes.\n", "Q: Picture of \"scenery\" appears on iPhone 6 lock screen I just noticed that what I thought was \"waveform bars\" (for lack of a better description) on my iPhone 6 was actually a miniature landscape of houses and trees. What is it and where did it come from?\nI upgraded from an iPhone 4S to iPhone 6S recently, so I'm not sure when I first noticed the issue, but I'm certain that it didn't exist on the iPhone 4. It's definitely not part of the original picture.\nEDITED TO ADD: I was wrong. It was in fact part of the \"original\" picture (the one I uploaded to the phone), created by another program. I hadn't noticed it on the iPhone 4 because of the screen size/screen tilt. I'll leave the question in the slim chance someone else has encountered such a problem, but in any case it's been solved.\nORIGINAL QUESTION CONT.\nIt's barely noticeable (showing only the tops, which to me look like a waveform) until I tilt the phone, then it becomes apparent what it is.\nSearching for quite some time on Google doesn't give me any answers. Anyone have any idea where this came from? I guess I could just change the image to see what happens, but in any case, it wouldn't explain where the image came from. My phone isn't jailbroken, so I'm doubtful it's some sort of malware that's gotten onto it (though not entirely impossible).\nThanks.\n\n\nA: This is from the wallpaper you have set.\niOS hasn't added this — it's been added by wherever the photo came from. For example, a screenshot of a photo from Snapchat may have a filter on the bottom, then because you took a screenshot rather than using the original photo, something may be added to the bottom.\nThe scenery isn't moving independently; the whole image moves with perspective as you move the phone around. It's more noticeable on the edges as this is where the image moves the furthest, and you have a reference (the edge of the display) to compare as the picture moves.\nChange your wallpaper to something else, perhaps to the original photo if the author can provide it to you without the edits.\n", "Q: Copy screenshot to clipboard in addition to saving the file Within OS X 10.11.6, the  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4  key combination saves a screenshot to the desktop by default.\nIs there a way to automatically copy the file to the clipboard (in addition to saving the file), so that the screenshot can be pasted into a document?  Maybe there is some clever why to tee and pipe the image to the clipboard?\nThe intent is to: \n\n\n*\n\n*save screenshot to a file and \n\n*copy screenshot to the clipboard \n\n\nwith a single command.   Examples are always appreciated.\n\nA: The following is an example of what I'd do, if I needed both, to place a screen shot on the clipboard and save it as a file at the same time.\nI'd use Automator to create a Service1 workflow, to which a keyboard shortcut could be assigned, to run an AppleScript script to have these two events happen in conjunction with each other.\nIn Automator, create a new Service1  with the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Service receives (no input) in (any application)\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code with the example AppleScript code shown further below:\n\n*Save the Automator Service1  as, e.g.: Screen Shot to Clipboard and File\n\n*Assign a shortcut, in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen Shot to Clipboard and File      ⇧⌘5 2\nNow when you press ⇧⌘5 2  the crosshair cursor appears just as though you had pressed ⇧⌘4, however after making the selection as normal and releasing the mouse, the selected area is both copied to the clipboard and saved to a file on the Desktop.\n\nmacOS Mojave Update:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 In macOS Mojave, a Service in Automator is now called a Quick Action, so select that. \n\n*2 By default, ⇧⌘5 in macOS Mojave is by assigned to a new Screenshot feature, so try ⇧⌘6 instead.\n\nThe file naming convention is that of the macOS default for Screen Shots saved normally, in my region. You may need to adjust the following line of code for it to be as in your region:\nset theDateTimeNow to (do shell script \"date \\\"+%Y-%m-%d at %l.%M.%S %p\\\"\")\n\nIn my region, this command produces the following example output where the value of the theDateTimeNow variable would be, e.g.:\n2018-01-13 at 12.04.30 PM\n\nBetween the line of code above and the two lines that follow it in the script, they produce, e.g.:\nScreen Shot 2018-01-13 at 12.04.30 PM.png\n\nIn Terminal, have a look at the man page for both date and strftime, in order to make adjustments to format the date and time value of the theDateTimeNow variable, as needed or wanted.\nNote: Read the comments throughout the example AppleScript code so as to understand what the script is doing.\nThis was tested under macOS 10.13.1 and worked for me without issue.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    --  # Screen Shot to Clipboard and File\n\n    --  # Clear the clipboard so the 'repeat until isReady ...' loop works properly.\n\n    set the clipboard to \"\"\n\n    --  # Copy picture of selected area to the clipboard, press: ⌃⇧⌘4\n    --  # Note that on my system I need to keystroke '$' instead of '4'.\n    --  # I assume this is because the 'shift' key is being pressed.        \n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"$\" using {control down, shift down, command down}\n    end tell\n\n    --  # Wait while user makes the selection and releases the mouse or times out.\n    --  # Note that the time out also acts as an escape key press of sorts.

addition to OS X with stock software So I want to install Windows and Linux (lets say Ubuntu) on a Macbook Pro.\nIdeally that should work without installing some Software like rEFI..whatever.\nThe 1st Problem is that OS X already occupies 3 partitions out of the 4 a MBR table can Support.\nBootcamp then shrinks thoose and adds a 4th Windows uses.\nMy plan now is to boot into a Linux live CD delete this 4th Partition and creating an Extended Partition there which would then contain the partitions /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 for Windows and Linux respectively.\nI am a little hesitant to just do it as I am not sure if that possibly irreversibly screws up the partitioning.\nHas anyone tried this before?\nAnd can the stock Boot Menu manage three Operating Systems like this?\n\nA: The drives containing the macOS operating system are required to use a GUID  partition table (GPT) and contain at least one EFI partition. This table holds up to at least 120 partition entries. There is also a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table on each drive, but this table is only used by Windows installations on older Mac models. \nWhile having extended partitions is theoretically possible, I have never seen any installation use such a configuration. There are other solutions that make extended partitions unnecessary. \nThe Startup Disk pane of the macOS System Preferences application, can display other operating systems and startup managers, but on the latest versions of macOS, only the macOS and Windows operating systems can be selected. \nYou can invoke the Startup Manager by holding down the option key on startup or restart. The Startup Manager menu can display and boot macOs, Windows, other operating systems and other startup managers. For other operating systems and/or startup managers to appear, the boot files usually have to copied to a location compatible with the Startup Manager.\nOn the newer model Macs, the instructions for adding Ubuntu after installing macOS and Windows can be found at the link below.\nInstalling Ubuntu on Mac with macOS and Windows already installed\nIf you already have macOS, Windows and Ubuntu installed on a Mac, the following link explains how to add Ubuntu to the Startup Manager menu.\nTriple boot macOS High Sierra, Ubuntu, and Windows without rEFInd\n", "Q: Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite: Where do I get the patch to fix the Meltdown exploit? All I found were articles on patch availability for El Capitan, Sierra, and High Sierra. Where do I get a patch to fix the Meltdown exploit? (type that into Google if you don't know what that is, it's been all the buzz in tech news last week)\nBonus points if there's also a patch to minimize the risk of the Spectre exploit.\n\nA: There are no patches for Yosemite as Yosemite is no longer supported. You will need to upgrade to a newer macOS. You can find details of patches for Meltdown and Spectre released by Apple in the question Is there a Meltdown vulnerability fix already available for macOS?.\n", "Q: Increase font size in pop up dictionary window in OS X Sierra On my Macbook Air running Sierra 10.12.5, there is no longer a Dictionaries directory under /Library, so the below suggested fix no longer seems to apply:\nDictionary lookup wider and taller (pop-up dictionary lookup styling) in OS X\nIs there still a way to do this? \n\nA: \nIn macOS High Sierra the location of the files has changed. And maybe also the structure too. The files are now under:\n/System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServi‌​ces_dictionaryOSX/\n\n\nThe directory structure has changed in more recent versions of OS X but the same approach linked to above works.\n", "Q: Search for alias not finding files I am running Yosemite on a Mac Pro Mid 2010. \nWhen I moved to an SSD for my boot drive, I started using Symbolic Linking so some apps would store their data on a regular HD. So, for example, I go to my library folder and in Application support there's an Evernote alias. It works flawlessly, and I've done this for many apps that don't offer an easy way to store data elsewhere. \nNow, my data drive is approaching its limit, and I have a larger drive coming. I'd like to be able to redirect the links to the new drive, and tried searching for \"kind is alias\" but that doesn't show the links. The Evernote alias doesn't get found in a search, nor do any others I know I've set up. \nTL;DR - How do I perform a search to show me Alias files I've created? A normal search, even for alias files I've just created, don't show up in a search. \n\nA: Did you use the Alias command from the finder when you created the links, or did you use ln -s in the terminal? Unix symbolic links are not quite the same as an Alias although they serve similar purposes. From the name of the service you installed, it's probably a good assumption they were using Unix symbolic links.\nIn that case, you'll probably want to use the find command in the terminal, e.g.: find /Users/yourhome/Library/ -type l\nAssuming that this was the service you installed, it looks like they're calling symlink from the standard C libraries, which in turn is going to use Unix symlinks, and not Mac OS aliases.\n", "Q: How to find all modified PDF files I have a folder of 6000+ PDF files (chapters, articles, etc.). I'm trying to weed out/sort those that I've just downloaded but never annotated. Is there a way to do this? Those PDFs that I've never annotated usually have the same \"created\" and \"modified\" dates, so I was thinking those criteria could be used (i.e., look for files whose modified date is later than/not the same as the created date), but I have no idea how to do that.\nIn other words, I need to be able to find any PDF on my computer that has been modified. \nThank you for any help!\n\nA: Per info in the OP and comments, this will do as you asked.\nIn Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Workflow.\n\n*Add a Find Finder Items action.\n\n\n*\n\n*With settings, e.g., Search (Documents)\n\n*(All) of the following are true\n\n*(Kind) (is) (PDF)\n\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the default code with the following example AppleScript code show further below:\n\n*Note: If Skim is not in the /Applications folder, then modify the value of the skimpdfPathFilename variable accordingly. You should not need to modify anything else unless you want to set the\nvalue of the offsetInSeconds variable, e.g. set offsetInSeconds to 60, to a different value. This variable is used to help find the files that really have been modified since they were created. The granularity differential between the creation date and modification date when a file is first created can be from 0 seconds to a higher value, which is not a consistent value depending on how the file was created. Make adjustments as you see fit for your use case.\nWhat the Workflow and example AppleScript code does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finds all PDF files in the target folder, including all subfolders.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is done with the Find Finder Items action and its output is passed to the Run AppleScript action.\n\n\n*Creates a list of all PDF files that have been modified after the creation date, per the value of the offsetInSeconds variable.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is done in the first repeat loop. Files meeting the criteria are stored in modifiedFilesList to be used in the next repeat loop. \n\n\n*Creates a list of all files that have annotations made in Skim.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is done using xattr to get the extended attributes of the target files. If a file has the target extended attributes a flag is set to true and if not, set to false. The files flagged as true go into annotatedSkimFilesList to be used in the next repeat loop.\n\n\n*Embeds in place the annotations made to the files in Skim.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the skimpdf utility within Skim on the files in annotatedSkimFilesList, annotations are embedded in place. Thus no need to export to a second file, then delete the original and replace it.\n\n\n\nNOTE: While I have tested this and it works without issue for me, nonetheless do not run this until you are sure you have a proper backup! You should also test the workflow on a small sampling of copied files placed outside of the actual search folder the workflow will be run on after testing is done.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set skimpdfPathFilename to \"'/Applications/Skim.app/Contents/SharedSupport/skimpdf'\"\n\n    set offsetInSeconds to 60       \n    set modifiedFilesList to {}\n    set annotatedSkimFilesList to {}\n\n    repeat with i from 1 to count input\n        set fileInfo to info for item i of input\n        set cDate to creation date in fileInfo\n        set mDate to modification date in fileInfo\n        if mDate > (cDate + offsetInSeconds) then\n            set end of modifiedFilesList to POSIX path of item i of input\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat with i from 1 to count modifiedFilesList\n        set withNotes to (do shell script \"xattr \" & quoted form of item i in modifiedFilesList ¬\n            & \" | [ $(grep -c \\\".*_notes$\\\") -ge 1 ] && printf 'true' || printf 'false'\") as boolean\n        if withNotes then\n            set end of annotatedSkimFilesList to item i in modifiedFilesList\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat with i from 1 to count annotatedSkimFilesList\n        do shell script skimpdfPathFilename & space & \"embed\" & space & ¬\n            quoted form of item i in annotatedSkimFilesList\n    end repeat\n\nend run\n\n\nUnderstanding the do shell script command in the second repeat loop:\nWhen a PDF is annotated in Skim and saved, extended attributes are set on the file, e.g.:\n$ xattr Filename.pdf \ncom.apple.FinderInfo\nnet_sourceforge_skim-app_notes\nnet_sourceforge_skim-app_rtf_notes\nnet_sourceforge_skim-app_text_notes\n$ \n\nThe output is piped | to:\n[ $(grep -c \\\".*_notes$\\\") -ge 1 ] && printf 'true' || printf 'false'\n\nWhich tests the output of grep counting the occurrences of the pattern and if grep finds one or more occurrences of the pattern, then the value of the withNotes variable is set to true, while being set to false otherwise.\nNote that Skim does have a built-in command line utility, e.g. /Applications/Skim.app/Contents/SharedSupport/skimnotes that can be used to test if a PDF has annotations made in Skim, however because of its output this utility is better used in an shell script run in Terminal then a do shell script command, and why I used xattr and grep instead. \n\nNote: The example AppleScript code above is just that, and does not include any error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted, the onus is upon the user to add any appropriate error handling for any example code presented and or code written by the oneself.\n\nA: Introduction\nBased on your questions and your follow-up comment below it, I think the solution can be as simple as what I am proposing. In addition to @user3439894's well-written comment, I believe you a couple of great choices to accomplish your task.\nThe Setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the location in Finder and navigate to the view options at the top. It looks like this: \n\n*Now, navigate to the arrangement options/bar at the top, click on them and you should see the following. Be sure to check both Date Modified and Date Created along with any other options you wish to sort by.\n\n*Next, sort your list by Date Modified, in my case I created the files one after another in consecutive naming order, don't let this fool you. I have changed the file 17.pdf and saved it. As you can see, it jumped to the top of the list. When viewed in deciding order. \nImplementation\nAs all files are now grouped by their Date Modified, you can drag them in chunks of individually into your droplet (assuming it does in fact function fully as you say it does).\nThis would cover the second half of your follow-up comment, while @user3439894 has given you essentially what you are looking for in the first half.\nI would be interested in following up with you on how things went, whichever option you choose is up to you, they are both alternatives to manually screening the data one by one.\n\nA: Probably the easiest thing to do would be to create a smart folder in Finder. This smart folder contains all of the files defined by your search criteria.  From there, it's very easy to sort the files in any which way you like.\nIn Finder, go to menu item File/New Smart Folder.\n\nIf you want to search your entire computer for the PDF files, select “Macintosh HD\" in the sidebar.  In the search field, simply input… .pdf\n\nOn the right side of that image you'll see a + button beneath the Save button.  Clicking that button will allow you to enter more search criteria.  There are tons of options you can choose.  I chose “file extension”  and added .pdf for the value\n\nIn Finder, go to menu item View/Show View Options\n\nMake sure \"Date Modified\" Is set in both available fields\n\nHit the \"Save\" Button underneath the tab that says new Smart Folder\n\nNow you will have a new smart folder with all of your PDFs in your Finder sidebar.\n\n", "Q: Blocking animated gifs in Safari I am trying to block animated gifts in Safari.\nI installed Deanimator, but it is dated and it does not always work.\nI also searched for Saft, but it seems this extension was abandoned.\nDoes anyone knows an alternative way of doing it?\n\nA: If you are willing to install and use a local filtering proxy:\nThe venerable Privoxy will allow you to deanimate GIFs.\nWhile a fine grained setup can be quite involved, that deanimated GIF-thing is quite easy to configure with the preset \"medium\" already. (Or via one radio button in the settings page.)\nPlaying those GIFs in a website you do want to see is then quite a hassle, though. That would require a trip to System Preferences, change proxy settings and then reloading the page. Depending on how often you need that feature, it's easiest to use another browser for that that does not get filtered.\nAs two examples: Firefox comes to mind, since it has proxy settings differing from the system preferences, or OmniWeb, which ignores the system settings.\n", "Q: How do I download Mac OS Sierra or High Sierra without an Apple ID? Couldn't find an official source for an installer/download of supported Mac OS versions. Everything I found goes to the App Store which prompts for an Apple ID.\n\nA: You can't, the Mac App Store naturally requires an AppleID and entering it is just part of the process to verify the user.\nI can really only think on one way and that is to get a friend who has downloaded the installer to give it to you as a file or a portable USB installer, more on that here.\nI am sure you have a valid AppleID, else just create another one, as it is much less complicated to just go the \"standard\" way and enter one if it prompts for one, than to have to worry about the legitimacy of other sources.\nSo to sum up, there is an option in the System Preferences' App Store tab to decide when to prompt for a password. This may be what you are looking for. Else the answer is no, as Apple likes to know who it's software goes to.\nI hope that helps, please let me know if you require clarification.\n", "Q: Native OS X Windows Snap Features 2018 As an Ubuntu and MS-Windows user, I regularly used the hotkey to snap a window to half the screen.  This feature was built-in to the operating system.   There are 7 year old threads which lists third party apps, which means enough time has elapsed to build the capability into the OS. \nQuestion: What is the proper term that one would use to search?  Is the capability baked into 2018 versions (10.11.6) of OSX? \n\nA: It’s not baked in. Magnet seems to be the most popular app, and it’s what I use. \n\nA: As Microsoft has patented windows snapping feature in order to prevent lawsuit Apple hasn't natively added this feature into MacOS \n\nMy suggestions would be if you are ok with third party apps \n1.Magnet \n2.Better snap tool\n3.Spectacles \nIf you want to use something simple natively on Mac without third party then use mission control trackpad gestures or set shortcuts as per your needs to use Mac like a pro multitasker with multiple desktops here is my example\n\nAnd when using mission control you can add apps to split screen just by swiping them to desired desktop\n", "Q: iTunes Connect - difference between units sold and units paid out, plus Apples commision I was wondering if anybody else noticed difference between units sold reported under the \"Sales and Trends\" section and what is actually paid out under \"Payments and Financial Reports\" section? I'm currently missing around 100 units, which equates to about $100-$200 loss. Does anybody know what is the best procedure to raise this issues with Apple, or better has anybody had similar issues and succeeded with Apple?\nSecondly, I also noticed an increase in the difference between \"Proceeds\" and \"Sales\" on the \"Sales and Trends\" section over the last year. The difference in the amount has been between 40-50% and recently as high as 66%. I thought apple only takes 30% commission. How come there is such a discrepancy between \"Sales\" and \"Proceeds\"?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The discrepancy is there because of several factors that you haven't accounted for, primarily:\n\n\n*\n\n*For some countries VAT is included in \"Sales\" and deducted before you get your \"Proceeds\"\n\n*Some purchases might be refunded by Apple because of customer complaints - i.e. you will get 0% proceeds for these\n\n*The currency exchange risk is yours. It might be that the exchange rate fluctates leaving you with less than the expected proceeds when converted to USD.\n", "Q: New Files App on iPhone Showing 0 Files With the old iCloud App on my iPhone SE, I could always see my Macbook's Desktop and Documents folder.\nThat is no longer the case with the new Files App!  It will show the amount of free space available, but no files.\nThe size matches what is actually shown in iCloud.  \nIn the Files App, it always shows 0 files.  My wife can still see all of the files from my MacBook's Desktop and Documents folder on her iPad (same iCloud account). However, I cannot.  \nI can create a new file/folder on my MacBook and it is viewable immediately on the iPad but not my iPhone.\nWhat could be causing this and how would I resolve this issue?\n\nA: You probably need to enable iCloud Drive in order to showcase the iCloud Drive files and folders.\n\nOn your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Settings > [your name]. \n  \n*Tap iCloud. \n  \n*Swipe to turn on iCloud Drive. \n  \n  \n  You can find your iCloud Drive files in the Files app.\nAfter you set up iCloud Drive, any documents that you've already\n  stored in iCloud are automatically moved to iCloud Drive. Your iPhone,\n  iPad, iPod touch, and iCloud.com keep your files in the Files app in\n  addition to the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps. If you don't see\n  your files in these apps, they might be on a device that doesn't have\n  iCloud Drive turned on (or under a different Apple ID).\n\nSet up iCloud Drive - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025\n", "Q: Purchasing all instruments doesn't work in GarageBand 10.0.2 GarageBand version 10.0.2. I haven't upgraded since getting this computer because I keep reading nightmare reviews about incompatibility with earlier project formats and more recently in versions 10.1 and 10.2, removal of functionality. Apple appears to be ignoring the negative reviews and pushing ahead with ruining GarageBand in future updates, so I'd like to avoid updating to 10.1 or later.\nMost instruments are grayed out. If I click on 1 of them it offers the complete collection for a 1-time purchase.\nExcept the \"Continue\" button doesn't work. Clicking it produces a loading spinner over the advertisement offer and then the window closes with no explanation of what happened.\nThe same thing happens with the purchase button off the main menu.\n\nA: Apple have made all the instruments free to download. It appears older versions of GarageBand don't understand the server response after this came into effect, and therefore it's not possible to download them without updating to the latest version of GarageBand.\nIt may be possible to use another computer or virtual machine with a newer version of GarageBand to download them, then copy them to your own computer, but I haven't tested this.\n", "Q: How to use remote Mac Mini without local monitor able to see? I want to use a Mac Mini remotely via the Finder, but my concern is that someone local to the machine could plug in a monitor and see what I was doing.\nIs there a way either to:\n(1) determine whether a local monitor is plugged in\n(2) prevent a local monitor from seeing what a remote user is doing on the machine\n\nA: You'll need to purchase Apple Remote Desktop from the Mac App Store.  Once you have it downloaded and installed you can click on the \"Curtain\" button and that will allow you to VNC or screen share to the system, but anyone physically there won't be able to see what you are doing.\n\nAlternatively, you could click the \"Control\" button and you'll be asked if you want to login to a new screen sharing session where either you Share the screen with someone physically there OR you are logging in as that user, but to a new viewing session only you can see.\n", "Q: How to transfer printer drivers from one mac to another? I have two macs: one I upgraded to High Sierra without wiping it. All my existing printer drivers function properly.\nThe second mac I upgraded fresh to High Sierra after a complete wipe. The printer drivers aren't working.\nI have a Konica Minolta Magicolor 7540 Grafx II. On the machine with the fresh OS install, the option for duplexing 11x17 is missing. I've tried several different versions of the driver, from various sources, and when I can get it to duplex, it only prints out the left hand side of the page. On one side of the double-sided print, it prints the left hand side of the page, properly positioned on the left hand side of the paper. One the second side of the duplex print, it prints the left hand side of the paper, but it is scooted over to the right, so there is a huge blank space on the left.\nIs there a way to transfer all the properly function print drivers from one mac to another? I have tried copying the file from Library> Printers> and Users>Library> Printers. That does indeed give me a second installation of the printer, but the duplexing issue is still there.\nKonica has not upgraded their print driver for almost two years, so simply downloading a new one for OS 10.13 isn't possible. The print driver that currently functions properly on my upgraded machine is version 1.7.\nI have tried downloading new driers, both of version 1.9 and version 1.7. I have tried copying the Printer settings from the old machine to the new machine. I've tried using the Add Printer function in the System Preferences.\nI don't know what else to try. Can anyone assist?\n\nA: I went through this yesterday and I found a solution -- at least a solution that worked for me.  \nI have an old Xerox WorkCenter printer for which Xerox no longer produces OS drivers ... but the printer works great.  After loads of experimentation, here's what I discovered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Folders such as /Library/Printers/... seems to be a repository of drivers but these are not drivers that are in use ... they are simply drivers that could be selected to support a printer that needs such a driver.\n\n*When you install a printer, it will search the folder for matching drivers.  \n\n*The driver you select will be copied to /etc/cups/ppd and renamed based on the name you gave your printer.  (Note that the top level /etc folder is a symbolic link to /private/etc these days)\n\n\nExample:\nMy Xerox WorkCenter C2424 was working on another mac and the driver was /etc/cups/ppd/WorkCenter_C2424_93_93_1b_.ppd   This name was previously auto-generated by the other mac based on the final octets of the printer's ethernet address.\nI copied the above file to the new mac but put it in the /Library/Printers/PPDs/Resources/Contents folder and renamed it back to just Xerox_WorkCenter_C2424.ppd.\nI then used the \"System Preferences\" -> \"Printers & Scanners\" to install the printer on the new mac.  Except rather than letting it auto-select the driver, I chose the \"Other...\" option which opens a file navigation window and navigated to the /Libary/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources folder and selected the driver I copied and renamed from the other mac.\nThis caused the mac to copy that PPD to the /etc/cups/ppd folder on the new mac and to rename the copy based on the name given in the printer list (you can give it any name you want).\nI tested the printer to make sure all features worked and verified this did indeed get the driver to the new mac (the new mac is running Mojave).\nI'm not sure if I'll get away with this trick whenever it comes time to upgrade to Catalina ... since Catalina seems to have strict rules on not supporting 32-bit code and these very old drivers are probably not 64-bit drivers.\n\nA: I know one solution would be to use the Migration Assistant. This has worked for me in the past. I believe you have to migrate \"Other files and folders.\"\nAnother possibility would be to turn on printer sharing on the Mac with the drivers. Then try to have the Mac, without the drivers, print through the Mac with the drivers. This should install the drivers on the Mac.\n\nA: I did the following to transfer printer related files from one mac to another (both Intel). My printer is Brother MFC-465CN.\n\n*\n\n*On source Mac:\ncd /etc\nsudo zip -r /tmp/cups.zip cups\ncd /Library\nsudo zip -r /tmp/Printers.zip Printers\n\n\n\n*Copy above zip files to destination Mac.\n\n\n*On destination Mac (running macOS Monterey):\ncd /etc\nsudo mv cups cups.save\nsudo unzip cups.zip\ncd /Library\nsudo mv Printers Printers.save\nsudo unzip Printers.zip\n\n\n\n*Add new printer from \"System Preferences -> Printers & Scanners\":\n\n*\n\n*Select the brother printer from the list.\n\n*The \"Use\" pulldown at the bottom automatically showed \"Brother MFC-465CN CUPS\".\n\n*Click \"Add\" to add printer.\n\n\n\n*From \"Options & Supplies\" for the new printer, viewing \"Supply Levels\" shows the ink levels correctly (in color), just like the source Mac.\n\nA: It's possible that the problem is not the driver files themselves, but the settings that they have.\nYou'll find most of the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) settings in /etc/cups, though just copying them en masse may be extreme. These include print queues (what MacOS calls \"printers\"), and their configurations.\nYou can also access the CUPS settings through a local webpage. First, you have to turn on the web interface. In Terminal, run the following command:\ncupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nThen, in a browser, type the URL: http://localhost:631\n(This is a local address on your computer, not a remote connection.)\nYou can check the settings on one Mac and configure the printers on the other. Click on \"Printers\" in the header, then click on the print queue, then on the right-hand drop-down menu, choose \"Set Default Options\". \n", "Q: Downloaded ios app never shows as purchased Ive downloaded twitter multiple time and on different iphone6 devices and it never shows as if I have already downloaded it, like its a fresh install every time, why would this only be happening with twitter?\n\nA: Are you using the same Apple ID for iTunes on all of these devices?\nCheck your iPhone settings > click on [your name] > click on iTunes and AppStores > then where is says your email address at the top and make sure that the emails match.\nIf they do, leave a comment stating that they match. What's going on is that if they do match, then check for items that you have purchased to see if they are are there. If they aren't you need to call Apple Support to speak to iTunes Support. \nBut MAKE SURE THAT THE EMAIL IS THE EXACT SAME EMAIL ADDRESS.\n", "Q: FaceTime option not showing on FaceTime user's contact One of my contacts just switched from Android to an iPhone and they have activated both FaceTime and iMessage. We both have iPhones SE and are both running iOS11.2.1. However, even though we can communicate through both iMessage and FaceTime, the option for the latter doesn't show in their contact card on my phone (their contact details on my phone are their FaceTime details). The option does appear on their contact on my MacBook Pro and all my contacts are syncing via iCloud.\nI have tried to restart the phone, turning both FaceTime and iMessage off and on again and even resetting my network settings, but still the Facetime option is not available for their contact.\nFurther more, when I go into the FaceTime app and to my FaceTime contacts, the only available option is to call them on regular phone. I have no issue with any other iPhone/FaceTime user in my contacts.\nI was wondering if anyone came across a similar situation and knew what is causing this?\n\nA: This is an Apple software glitch, as long as you are able to call them then you should be fine. The Facetime image is supposed to detail if said person is available to video chat on that device at the moment. Apple hasn't really addressed the issue since its cosmetic. \n\nA: I had the same problem, my wife switched from Samsung to iPhone and didn't appear in my contact list as a Facetime user. I tried everything but ended up resetting the settings on my iPhone. So General > Reset > Reset All Settings. Hope this works for you!\n\nA: Go into FaceTime. Add the person that you want to FaceTime and you should be able to make a call directly from the FaceTime app. Some older model iPhones don’t have the option in the contacts to FaceTime contacts. So you have to do it somewhat manually \n", "Q: PWA application using angular 4 is not rendering properly on Safari We had developed a PWA application using angular 4, website url: https://www.peepingpeacock.com which is working fine on Google chrome.\nbut this Progressive web application do not render properly in Safari(Both Mac laptop and Mobile IOS browsers) and noticed it hangs the Safari browser and even very hard to open Web inspector.\nHow we see on  Chrome browser of Mac:\n\nHow we see in Safari of Mac:\n\nAny thoughts on this issue is highly appreciated. \n\nA: It was a polyfill issue. please read following,\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10420\n", "Q: How can I find the passphrase in the keychain after adding it with ssh-add -K I have added my ssh passphrase to my keychain with ssh-add -K option but I cannot seem to find it in the keychain.

I even looked at every single entry in the login keychain to see which applications are allowed to read in case I stumble on ssh-agent.

If I leave Mail.app open and turn on a system-wide VPN on my MacBook Outlook (one of my email accounts) gets mad at me and disables my account and I have to use microsoft's outlook.com to sign in again and reset my password etc. because apparently \"somebody else is using your account.\"\nHow can I stop this from happening?\nRecently I've stopped leaving Mail.app open all the time so that I don't accidentally cause the problems when I start a VPN and forget to quit Mail.app first.\nBut this is a pain b/c of course I don't get notifications and don't get emails as soon as they arrive.\nIs there a way to disable that account while a VPN is in use?\nOr somehow stop these problems.\n\nA: \nHow can I stop this from happening?\n\nThis is expected behavior.\nMicrosoft (Outlook.com) uses location data (if available) as part of their security to validate authorization access; t's more than just your IP.\nYou can view all of your activity from Microsoft at the site:\nhttps://account.live.com/activity\n\nUsing a VPN with Outlook.com\nA VPN (Virtual Private Network) takes your traffic (all or some, depending on the policy set at the VPN server) and sends it through their network.  If you go to https://account.live.com/activity while connected to VPN, you will see that your IP address has changed (very significantly).  You are no longer \"located\" at your home, but now wherever your work's network gateway is located.\nAs such, (Microsoft) Outlook.com will detect this change and based on their security policies temporarily lock your access since it \"appears\" you went from one location to the next with the same cached credentials.\nTurn on Two Factor Authentication\nIf you use two factor authentication (Microsoft Authenticator App), you can mitigate this somewhat.  Outlook.com will detect the change in location and ask you to authenticate (iPhone version shown):\n\nPrior to locking your account, it should ask you to approve or reject the new sign in.\nYour other option is to close Mail (or log out of Outlook.com), connect to the VPN and then reopen.  You will need to do this for each time there is a network change so there is a bona fide  log in as opposed to an authorization request based on stale cached credentials.\n\nA: What worked for me is just to quit mail and re-open it.\nThis seems to work most consistently when quitting mail before starting the VPN and re-opening it while the VPN is on.\n", "Q: External Monitor Periodically Flashes Blue with 2016 MBP on High Sierra I'm running into an issue with my 2016 MBP with touchbar, after updating to High Sierra, where my LG 27UD69 external monitor will periodically have the whole screen turn blue for a split second before going back to normal. The monitor is connected to my MBP using the provided HDMI cable which then goes through an Anker thunderbolt-3 to HDMI adapter. I'm outputting 4K at 60hz. \nEverything was working fine prior to the high sierra update and continues to work perfectly when running windows 10 under bootcamp. I would really appreciate help with solving this issue.\nEdit (more detail)\nI'm running macOS version 10.13.12. Also, my Macbook is connected to power at all times while using the monitor.\n\nA: I have had this issue when restarting my MacBook Pro while being connected to a 4K TV. I found that in addition to the blue flash, it sometimes decides to turn black for a fraction of a second during normal operation (with an external monitor attached).\nThe way I was able to fix this is by connecting the Mac to power from the wall. Having researched this extensively a couple of months ago, I found out that the video initialization (and apparently frame rate conversion) to the 4K monitor or TV causes the blue flashing as it undergoes the process of colour matching, scaling etc. I am not too sure why it is blue, but that's a topic for later.\nI'll spare you the links and instead have summarized it here. This issue annoyed me at the beginning but since having my mac plugged into the wall outlet, I have not come across it again. I hope my interpretation of your issue was correct, please let me know whether having the Mac plugged in makes a difference in your case, I'd be interested in following up with you on this.\nAddition\nIf you have access to another High Speed HDMI cable, perhaps you can borrow one, I suggest you try replacing it with the current. My guess would be that perhaps the adaptor is somehow degrading the signal. I personally have had issues with non-Apple adaptors in the past - especially when 4K quality or high frame rate is key. I'm certainly no expert on accessories but maybe it is really worth testing another adaptor.\n", "Q: Why does Photos keep using OLD library?

I want to decommission that hard disk totally and I don't want to break my photo library!\n\nA: It looks like you did everything you should.\nI have many times made a new photos library, set it as the system library and then rebooted so you're on the proper path there. My hunch is you have iCloud turned on for that library as well and need to resolve that.\nI would turn off photo stream and shared photos and restart one time to see if that resolves. If not - you'll need to disable iCloud photo library and walk away from the broken local library or try rebuilding the affected library.\nWorst case, contacting Apple support sometimes helps. They often know of edge cases like this where things get stuck and can advise you some hidden tricks to get the libraries unstuck.\n", "Q: Time Machine failing no error I have periodically used my time machine for years now. The last time I backed up was November 2017 and I started to try and back it up last night and it took ages to \"prepare\" and started to back up, but then kept failing. When I click the red (i) symbol on my TimeMachine it just says\n\nTime Machine couldn't complete the back up.\n\nThere's no further answer as to why. I ran it a few times and noticed that it now says that the last successful backup was June 2015. So I don't know what happened to the other 2 years worth of backups. It was still saying last back up was November 2017 on previous failures yesterday.\nHow do I resolve this?\n\nA: It sounds like you may need to dive into the logs to get some more info.\nMacOS uses unified logging so the logs aren't stored in a specific file. In Terminal, this command should print all TimeMachine backup failure messages:\nlog show --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.TimeMachine\"' --info | grep 'Backup failed'\n\nHowever this cuts out quite a bit of information, so you may need to use the broader search:\nlog show --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.TimeMachine\"' --info | grep 'Error'\n\nRunning this on my machine showed TimeMachine to be quite noisy so it may take some time to find something useful in the output especially if you have been running TimeMachine for a while\nPost back here with any errors you find. \n", "Q: Missing disk space on macOS I have a 250G disk on my Mac with around 100G in use.

If you haven't rebooted the computer yet, that's worth a shot, but also booting into recovery mode and running first aid on the disk might help. lsof | grep deleted might also reveal interesting information, if lsof is available on OSX (I assume it is, but I've never looked)\nI've also noticed in my own use that if I use a tool like DiskInventory or Grand Perspective and there are other users on the system, they won't show the size of other users files if I don't have read access to them (reasonably so). If you have other users on your system, they may have large files in their home directory you're not seeing.\n\nA: I finally reinstalled the system after erasing the volume. With a Time Machine backup it was more or less a smooth experience. Now I have 170G of free space.\ntl;dr:\n\n\n*\n\n*Missing disk space can be related to a broken filesystem\n\n*APFS tooling is currently really bad, you probably need to erase the volume and reinstall to fix any filesystem problem\n\n\nA: Commands given below resolved the issue for me.

I've successfully solved my own issue of lost hd space which seems to have happened due to deleting g files over a network which deletes the files but leaves behind a hidden file called an smbdelete file.  Here's how to get rid of it.\nGo into terminal and type:. defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\nThis shows all hidden files in OSX.\nHold down alt and right click on finder and select relaunch.\nLook for the smbdelete files and delete them.  Your storage will reappear.  The location of these files can be found by using the manage storage facility in OSX to look for folders that look larger in size than they should be.   Mine were on the desktop so we're easy to find.

I don't want want some deleted files on my Mac to be stored on my backup HDD and even for restores. For example if I put back the data on the HDD to my Mac does it do a file level or block level restore?\n\nA: Time Machine works with individual files and folders. You can set up Time Machine exclusions in System Preferences → Time Machine → Options. Any files or folders in this list won't be backed up and won't be restored.\n\n\nA: It does file-level versioned backup. It is intended as a set-and-forget type of universal backup, so as long as your backup drive is at least as big as your OS drive, all you need to do is keep it available and backups will be taken care of.

From the time of its arrival I have had a serious problem with external USB3 drives (I have tried a variety from different manufacturers) attached to the ports on the back of the iMac Pro, ejecting 95% of the time when I wake the iMac Pro from sleep.  If I restart, the external USB3 hard drives reappear and function perfectly until the next time I put the iMac Pro to sleep. They do not dismount during use. The only setting I have checked in System Preferences > Energy Saver is “prevent computer from sleeping automatically when display is off”. \nTo solve this problems I have tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the SMC Controller; \n\n*resetting the NVRAM; \n\n*completely reinstalling the Mac OS High Sierra software using Command > Recovery; \n\n*Using a variety of USB3 HD’s from different manufacturers. \n\n\nNone of this has resolved the issue. I am now able to use my new iMac Pro with only the supplied keyboard attached to a USB port on the back of the iMac Pro and two external Thunderbolt HD’s (which do not produce any problems).\nAny solution that you can supply to these issues would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I had this problem with a WD 6TB external HDD on wake(encrypted HDD) starting with Sierra and continuing into High Sierra. It would show in Finder (but not libraries or files) and DiskUtility, but would not mount. Running FirstAid failed on the physical disk. All was normal on restart. \nUnfortunately It was not seen by TimeMachine and so I ended up with backups without the drive contents. Subsequent backups after restarts ended up erasing all old backups and backing up the entire drive for the next 14 hours.\nUninstalling the WD Utilities, especially WD Utility Helper which runs in background solved the issue. Installing or even just running the WD Utilities executes the helper as well as puts it into the user's startup jobs.\n", "Q: iMessage access We have a 14 year old daughter we are trying to monitor her texting. We use a third party app that captures deleted texts but it’s not real-time not user friendly.  How do I set up our phones wher all of her texts come to us as well?\n\nA: If they are iMessages then you could do it via iCloud. For SMS messaging or if it's over Whatsapp or another instant messenger, you could have a much harder time.\nMost half decent services for messaging offer end-to-end encryption so it would be virtually impossible to act as a middle man as you're describing.\nYou could call your service provider and ask if they have any services for this kind of thing, but keep in the back of your mind - if you can do this to your child's phone, how do you know malicious hackers couldn't be doing the same to you.\nThis kind of privacy and security is a pretty hot topic at the moment so I think it would be scary if there did happen to be an easy way to accomplish what you are trying.\n", "Q: iOS 9.3.5 in iPad Mini 1 I have a first-generation iPad mini (model MD529LL/A, A1432, 32GB) running iOS 8.4.1. I use it mostly for web browsing with Safari and Chrome, email with Gmail, reading PDFs with iBooks and Adobe Acrobat, maps with Google Maps. It's not the fastest experience but it works just fine. \nHowever, some apps no longer support iOS 8 and I'm considering upgrading the iPad to iOS 9.3.5, the latest version supported for this model.\nWill this upgrade make my iPad feel much slower?\nWhat other downsides should I be aware of?\n\nA: I think you can expect some slowdowns, especially in the time it takes to launch some apps. Here's an excerpt from an article that compared iOS 8 and 9 on the iPad mini:\n\nThe decrease in app responsiveness is a disappointment considering Apple's claims, but we have to consider that we are dealing with old hardware that just doesn't seem to handle Apple's new Metal API/compiler particularly well. At least flicking through home screens is reasonably smooth, even if using complicated apps isn't - scrolling through the Guardian app on the iPhone 4s or iPad mini is surprisingly juddery.\nAt least the iPhone 4s gained some battery life from the update to iOS 9 - the 40 minute (approximately 9 per cent) increase in our Web use test, as well as Low Power Mode, suggests that in everyday use you'll be less likely to feel battery anxiety. The iPad mini showed no signs of extra life after updating to iOS9. We should stress that both devices on test have been in constant use since their launches three and four years ago, so both devices have suffered battery fatigue. We're only interested in the comparative times, allowing for a few per cent margin of error due to climatic conditions affecting the battery chemistry in the devices.\n\nSomething further to consider is that not all new iOS 9 features are enable on the 1st gen iPad mini. Again, from the same article:\n\nApple's latest iOS brings plenty of new and useful features, but most are confined to newer hardware. For example, none of the new multitasking features are available for the iPad mini. You'll need at least an iPad mini 2 or iPad Air to invoke picture-in-picture and Slide Over, while only the iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2 or iPad Pro can handle side-by-side Split View.\n\nSo, you'll have to balance that against the increased security, new features that are enabled, and increased app compatibility that iOS 9 will bring to your iPad mini.\nAnd, if you end up installing iOS 9 on your iPad mini and regretting it, downgrading back to iOS 8 is no longer an option. So, one other downside (if you can really call it that) to consider is that iOS 8 to iOS 9 on your iPad mini will be a one-way trip.\n", "Q: How do you change the environment variables for VLC on macOS High Sierra?

Then my Mac wouldn’t login, it gives me a black screen then it restarts. \nSo I decided to reinstall the software, but first I need to back up my data. I’ve been trying since last night. I put Mac in recovery mode, then I created a “compressed” disc image to put it on an external hard drive. I wanted to make sure I can open it before I reinstall and in the process lose all the data. I put it on a friend's Mac, and it keeps saying “no mountable file systems” and the dmg won’t open. The dmg file has a size of 500 GB. \nIs there any other way to backup my data, given that I can't login into my Mac after the High Sierra install?\n\nA: I am assuming you are looking to back up data rather than the entire drive, as your OS image is probably faulty. \nThat being the case, you may be able to start up in Target Disk Mode, and then you can browse the files and copy them to another disk as if the HDD in the Mac was just an external drive. There are a couple caveats to this though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your Mac is compatible - Given that you are updating to Sierra it is likely that it is.\n\n*You will need another Mac to connect the dead one to.\n\n*You need a USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, Firewire or Thunderbolt 2 Cable\n\n\nConnect the computers up, and when starting the broken machine, immediately press and hold 'T'.\nAll being well it will appear as a disk on the other Mac.

When you join the shared storage you are no longer able to also have your own private plan.\nIf for some reason you want to cancel the shared plan or she wants to leave it and is using over 5GB of storage(free plan threshold) - she will have 28 days to sign up for a new private plan that covers the amount of data she has stored.\nSource: Apple\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete a TimeMachine backup subdirectory with the rm command? I deleted a TimeMachine backup subdirectory with:\nrm -rf /Volumes/.../Backups.backupdb/.../2017-06-07-125321\n\nThen later I realized that I could do it better with the standard utility and did this for another subdirectory\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/.../Backups.backupdb/.../2017-06-07-125444\nPassword:\nDeleting: /Volumes/.../Backups.backupdb/.../2017-06-07-125444\nDeleted (44.4G): /Volumes/.../Backups.backupdb/.../2017-06-07-125444\nTotal deleted: 44.4G\n\nNow, how to I verify that the TimeMachine backup at /Volumes/.../Backups.backupdb/ is still reliable since the first rm ... command I ran, can presumably be destructive in some way?\n\nA: The Basics\nThe first command you ran, included the rm -rf flag, this (as you are no doubt aware of) removes the files and folders within the given directory (i.e. recursive deletion). It means that you will no longer be able to recover from this backup. It did not affect the parent (or higher) directories.\nThe rm command should be used with caution, as you rightfully point out. It can absolutely delete everything (permanently) with one wrong command. I, therefore, recommend to always use the TimeMachine command itself to delete the backup - included since OS X Lion.\nDeleting with Time Machine \nTerminal:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/drive_name/Backups.backupdb/[MAC-NAME]/YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss\nManually:\nAs you are concerned with maintaining the interity of the backup setup, you may like to consider using the following method instead (extracted here):\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter time machine\n\n*Select the backup\n\n*Right click on the backup (on the finder window)\n\n*Select 'Delete Backup' (you may be prompted for a password)\n\n\nConclusion\nYou first command did not affect the root directory to which any past or future backups are/will be stored. You can test it out by going to TimeMachine in the menu bar and selecting Back Up Now, alternatively, you can try to recover to a backup made an hour earlier to discover whether the data is there, it is, because the rm command only removed the contents of the given directory.  \nAdditionally: When rm becomes destructive\nIt is not unless you are totally new to the command or become complacent in your ability to apply correct procedures with the command, that you begin to make mistakes. If you are interested in some of the donts when using the command, how about this and this article, both make for an amusing read if you have a minute spare.\nI hope I was able to interpret your question correctly, do let me know if that made sense to you or if you have any follow-up questions.

Problem is that AppleTV stopped working as soon as I unplugged HDMI cable from monitor or device. I tried with the turned off the monitor and it also works, so I need a way to fake it AppleTV that there is a monitor/tv.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't put a MacBook into Target Display Mode like an iMac, so short of disassembling your MacBook to wire the internal Display Port the monitor uses to one of the external ones (assuming your Mac has one) there doesn't appear to be a way.\n\nA: I found a solution. We simply need to connect our Apple TV device to our MacBook using USB cable, open a QuickTime player and choose New Movie Recording. Then we need to choose Apple TV as a camera and microphone source. Because Apple TV uses HDMI Hot-Plug-Detect feature that makes the source device aware that it has been connected/disconnected to/from the screen we need to use HDMI dummy plug (Display Emulator) that will emulate a monitor connected to the device.

It got a flashing LED light indicating the firmware was about to be updated. Then, 3 times power off automatically in a short period, end up with a normal OS X startup. Everything stay still. In another word, the Boot ROM Version hasn't been changed.\nAny idea?\n\nUpdate @11 Jan 2018:\nI've just seem a related post Is there any way to manually bless firmware when main disk is external?\nIt seems that the root cause is running OS X from a second internal disk. Unfortunately the first one of my MacBook is out of order.\n\nUpdate @13 Jan 2018:\nConfirmed the following methods do not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*replaced the Samsung SSD with original Apple HDD and tried again. The ia.log was same as that of SSD\n\n*kept internal hard drive connected, connected the USB external drive or SXCARD reader. It selected the ESP on internal hard drive as the staging EFI. Thus, same result as above.\n\n*disconnect all internal hard drive, connected the USB external drive and SXCARD reader. Got the log as \n\n\nNo appropriate ESP could be found. Error while writing firmware updater for EFI.\n\n\nA: The EFI partition is used when the firmware is updated. I assume this EFI partition must be on the primary internal disk. Apple posted that firmware updates require a GUID partition scheme at the archived website Firmware updates for Intel-based Macs require a GUID partition scheme, although the site does not explicitly say this must be the primary drive. When a SDD or HDD is formatted to use a GUID partition scheme by the Disk Utility or diskutil command, the EFI partition is automatically created.\nBasically, the firmware update is copied to the FAT32 formatted EFI partition. The firmware is then instructed to update itself. Basically, the same procedure occurs for firmware updates on my HP PC running Windows. So, this is not unique to Apple Macs.\nHaving to update the firmware to run High Sierra makes sense. The APFS is new and older Macs would need a firmware update before being able to recognize this filesystem and read the boot files.\nYou used to manually update the firmware. At some point, Apple decided to include firmware updates in the macOS installs. Apple posted this in the now archived website About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers.\n\nA: Just wanted to post on this topic since I had a related problem in an Apple store yesterday and this was the post I found.  \nApple had replaced my logic board but didn't install the newer firmware and so I could no longer boot off of my existing SSD drive (which was formatted with APFS, and had my original Mojave and all of my files).\nLuckily one of the geniuses had a good idea.  Boot off of Mojave on a USB, and plug in a new blank external hard drive, and install Mojave onto that.  As part of the installation process, the firmware was installed.  Then, the USB stick and external hard drive were removed, the machine rebooted, and it could finally boot off of its original Mojave on the existing SSD drive.\n\nA: Key point: Get the primary internal disk work. \nThen unplug the second internal disk. Boot the machine with an USB to install high sierra, by following the standard installation guide. After that, the firmware will be upgraded.\nAlternatively, you may use bless to update it manually, as long as the primary internal disk is there.\n\nA: Putting an original hard disk drive in the MacBook Pro and building off my Samsung SSD via the USB port resolve the firmware update issue for me. \n\nA: Unfortunately this is no longer the case... Apple changed their installers (assuming to make sure older devices can't take advantage anymore), and now when you do a fresh install, it basically skips the firmware update. At least on my 2012 Mac Mini\n", "Q: How are videos in 23.97 frames per second shown How does the Mac deal with video content played back at a rate that does not neatly fit into 60 fps screen refresh?\nI have never noticed 23.97 content looking wrong to my eyes, so is this a solved issue?\n\nA: 24fps videos on a 30fps display (closer to 23.976fps on 29.97fps) divides out into 4/5. Conversion of film frame rate to display/TV frame rate is known as Telecine. NTSC video uses 2:3 Pulldown as the method for displaying 24fps on a 30fps device. 2 of the 5 frames in each pulldown cycle are interlaced.\nYou can do the same math with 23.976fps/24fps on a 59.94fps/60fps display: 23.976/59.94 = 2/5. While I don't know the exact pulldown method for this frame rate, the concept is essentially the same.\nWhile each individual frame is available as a still, your mac handles the pulldown and frame interlacing on the fly.\n(This is why 120fps and 144fps displays are great - 24fps divides into 120fps and 144fps evenly, so the video shows each video frame for 5 and 6 display frames, respectively. No interlacing artifacts.)\n", "Q: Have installed “Command line” but whenever i try to build and run my program terminal says “No such file or directory” \nI have tried to build and run my project through CodeLite.\nI have installed Command Line but somehow it doesn't work.\nIt says \"no such file or directory\"\nbut whenever I ask it to look for gcc, it tells me that i have it in my Mac. \nWhat should I do?

Disk1 is a virtual (\"synthesized\") disk based on the APFS physical store disk0s2.\nDisk1 doesn't have a partition scheme. Additionally it contains your boot volume disk1s1.\nTherefore the command diskutil partitionDisk ... run booted from your main boot volume (Macintosh HD) shouldn't be able to completely repartition and reformat neither disk0 nor disk1.\nYou can verify the disk and the APFS container/volumes with:\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0 # verify physical disk\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2 # verify APFS container\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk1s1 # verify APFS boot volume\n\nThe second command may yield something like:\nwarning: Overallocation Detected on Main device: (626695+1) bitmap address (28278)\n\nwhich seems to be normal.\nThe third command usually checks all available APFS volumes despite passing on only one slice (disk1s1).\nTherefore you will/should see the output:\nChecking the APFS volume superblock\nChecking the object map\nChecking the fsroot tree\nChecking the snapshot metadata tree\nChecking the extent ref tree\nChecking the snapshots\n\nseveral times.\n\"The partition map appears to be OK\" or \"exit code is 0\" indicates that everything is OK.\n", "Q: Shortcut for toggling hidden files in Finder with AZERTY layout There's a shortcut for toggling the hidden files in Finder that works on QWERTY layouts: SHIFT + CMD + '.'\nHowever, on my AZERTY layout (Belgian more specifically) this doesn't work.

I had to go in to single-user mode because I couldn't log into my admin account, I made a new account and changed my admin password.\nNow, on my first admin account, I can search for my files but everything is like it is factory reset? My wallpaper, and everything. I can only look things up, and once I do, they are on my laptop again. Help? Where are all of my files? How could I solve this? \nWhat's more odd, I only had approximately 7.18 GB before I went into single-user mode. This meaning that my data is still obviously here. Please anyone? I'm clueless.\n\n\nA: Let's see if I understood correctly: you had admin account A but you couldn't log in; you created admin account B and logged in with that, and changed account A's password, then you logged back in with account A but you found what seems the default \"new account\" environment (no data at all); BUT you can search your files and when they're found those icons will actually appear on their respective locations...?\nI can't see where \"single user mode\" (shift pressed at boot time) fits in this description: there's no need for single user mode to create a new admin account (even if you had self-login enabled on your only user account - bad idea! - you could boot with cmd-S and do \"/sbin/mount -uw /\" and then \"rm /var/db/.applesetupdone\" and then reboot to create a new admin account).\nI think that your SSD is\n1. too full,\n2. too small, and\n3. has a (hopefully) lightly damaged structure... \nso boot with cmd-R and use Disk Utility to repair it. If this fails, try using DiskWarrior to rebuild the directory.\nOtherwise (if Disk Utility fails and you have no access to DiskWarrior) you could do this:\n1. Log in with you B account\n2. Download Carbon Copy Cloner (one month trial) and clone the internal SSD on an external disk, then disconnect it (do it now, seriously. Later you'll use it for a Time Machine automated backup).\n3. Now you can format the internal SSD and install OS X from scratch, just boot with cmd-R and follow the on screen instructions.\n4.

I have an early 2013 Retina MacBook Pro with only a Windows 10 partition. MacOS is not currently installed on the machine. The Windows 10 partition is encrypted with BitLocker and because of the partitions layout, I believe MacOS cannot currently be installed alongside Windows.\nCan I temporarily swap the original SSD for a new empty compatible SATA III and perform a clean install of MacOS on the new SDD? I would like to see if any EFI and SMC updates are available for the MacBook.\nWhen I'm done with MacOS, I would like to put the original SDD back in and continue where I left off Windows 10.\n\nA: The boot volume does not need to be internal for OS X. Use any USB drive, boot while holding cmd+R. You will boot the recovery partition (from the disk of existing or other online, so it might ask you for a network connection). \nThen just install on the external drive and boot from that by holding alt/option during startup. \n\nA: What to propose should work. You will need to boot to internet macOS Recovery to install macOS. See the Apple website: How to reinstall macOS. When booted to macOS Recovery, you will probably have to use the Disk Utility to initialize, before installing macOS. If this does not install High Sierra, then you will need to download and install High Sierra from the Apps Store. This is the easiest way to get the latest firmware Updates.\nWhen changing drives, you may need to hold down the option key at startup to invoke the Startup Manager.

I wonder if there is some setting that would make all of them fine. I would also like to understand why this is happening.\n\n\nA: The reason behind this is that TortoiseHg is not really written for macOS in the first place - it is really foremost a Windows application written using a cross-platform GUI toolkit called Qt.\nWhen porting the program to macOS, the programmers behind TortoiseHg have not used native macOS APIs for implementing their user interface. Instead they have saved a lot of time reusing their existing code benefiting from the cross-platform features of Qt.\nUnfortunately this also means that features like Retina do not freely right away. On Windows the support for Hi-DPI displays have just recently begun to improve, so the focus for Windows applications on supporting Hi-DPI displays (Retina) haven't really been there.\nFor some components used by the programmers the Retina-functionality came \"for free\" by the virtue of the Qt library using native macOS APIs for rendering. For other components, the pixels are drawn (rendered) by the Qt code itself, and thus without Retina-functionality from macOS.\nTherefore you experience programs that exhibit odd behaviours where for example the text is crisp and \"Retina\", but the icons are out of proportions and \"low-resolution\".\n", "Q: How do I undo an import into macOS calendar? I imported an iCalendar (.ics) file into macOS Calendar. Because I expected the file to only contain a handful of events, I chose to add the events to an existing calendar rather than create a new one. However, the file turned out to contain hundreds or thousands of events, most of which were not relevant to me and which I don't want spamming my calendar.\nI tried to undo the import immediately after it happened, but undo was not available. I tried manually deleting some of the events, which works for some of them, but many others have other invitees and Calendar says it will notify them when I delete the event which I want to avoid as it would mean sending many notifications. I don't want to delete the calendar to which I added the events, as it already contained a lot of events that I don't want to lose and that would be a lot of work to note down and recreate.\nIs there any way I can bulk remove these events without sending a bunch of notifications? I'm willing to use third-party software if necessary.\nEdited to add: Most/all of the invitees on these events are long_string_of_mixed_alphanumerics@group.calendar.google.com addresses, so I assume the emails would be sent to some sort of group of subscribers or members on the Google Calendar from which the events were exported.\nIf I try to move one of the offending events to another calendar, I get a message:\n\nYou're about to send an invitation for \"event_name\".\nDo you want to send \"event_name\" now, continue editing the event or revert the changes?\n\nThe options are Revert, Edit, or Send.\n\nA: It sounds like your calendar event was generated from Google Calendar as an event which 'repeats itself' a number of times. If that is the case, and if you have imported this event in a calendar which you have linked to a Google account, you should be able to open it from Google Calendar and remove the event from there, including all the recurrencies of the event. When you do so, you can choose not to notify others of these deletions.\n", "Q: Is there a gui fuzzy finder like rofi?

I did checked the drive, appears to be fine (SMART status).\nAnybody recognises this issue?, any fix?\nThanks!\n\nA: I understand you have a 32 bit EFI. I do not think this has anything to do with the BIOS. Since you have already installed 64 bit Windows 7, I am guessing it does not.\nIn your comments, you say you modified the CD. So I can assume you have a working DVD drive. When you say you modified, I assume this involved oscdimg.\nApple does not officially support 64 bit Windows on your model Mac. Well, I have a 2007 iMac, which Apple does not officially support 64 bit Windows, yet I have run 64 bit Windows 7 and I am currently running 64 bit Windows 10.\nI assume the Windows 7 installation DVD has Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or later included. This is a requirement according to the Apple website Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp. \nYou have to installed Windows for a BIOS boot. It not a question of whether you can install to use a EFI boot, but rather the restriction is in the drivers. The Boot Camp Support Software for your Mac assumes you are using a BIOS boot method. This software includes the drivers for your Mac. \nYou can download the Boot Camp Support Software for your Mac from the website Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. Since you have a 64 bit install, you might have trouble installing this download. If so, refer to the website Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7 or 8.\nFinally, you might not be blessed. If not, then your Mac would be slow to boot. Click on this link for instructions on how to bless your Windows 7 install. The instruction assume you have already installed the Boot Camp Support Software.\n\nNote: Many people have assumed the latest release the the Boot Camp Support Software should always be used. This is completely wrong. You have to use the Boot Camp Support Software released for your model Mac. Windows is designed to accept older drivers and even 32 bit drivers when the current driver is not available.

Since iOS11 one is forced to use 2FA, unless one wants to do without a second factor. But 2FA has the disadvantage that the passcode is transmitted to the iCloud. But I don’t know when this is the case. So I would like to know when and how this happens?\nWhat I know is that I don’t like it and don’t need it. Can anyone help me to feel less uncomfortable with this?\nAn other question related to the passcode is why the phone/cloud saves the last attempt?\nEdit:\nI found the documentation. HT202303 says: \"To access your data on a new device, you might be required to enter the passcode for an existing or former device.\"\nSo this means when I activate 2FA, my passcode is uploaded to the cloud. And for a 6-digit passcode there is no \"encryption\" or whatever. Is is super simple to bruteforce.\nNow as these keys are transferred to China, how can I be sure that my iPhone security is not totally compromised when using 2FA?\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, no passcodes you use to unlock your phone are sent anywhere. With 2FA, you sign into something with your passcode as normal, and then a challenge code is sent to authorized devices for you to also enter. The challenge code is generated on Apple's end of things and only sent to devices you've already confirmed. See Apple's documentation on how 2FA works.\nEdit after your comment:\nAh, I see the disconnect. The section you are referring to is specifically regarding Keychain escrow. This is an optional feature when setting up iCloud keychain syncing that allows apple to keep a secondary copy of your keychain. By default, iCloud simply syncs the keychains across your devices. If you set up escrow with Apple, they will keep their own copy of your keychain to be synced as your devices sync separately and securely. This allows recovery of a keychain if your only (or all) iCloud authorized device is lost. So first it's important to realize that this only applies if you setup keychain escrow.\nSecond, while your device passcode will be used by default as your \"secure key\" for the escrow, that passcode is not sent to Apple. It is instead used to encrypt the escrowed copy of your keychain. Specifically this paragraph (all quotes taken from the January 2018 iOS Security Guide linked in the comments below):\n\nNext, the iOS device exports a copy of the user’s Keychain, encrypts it wrapped\n  with keys in an asymmetric keybag, and places it in the user’s iCloud key value\n  storage area. The keybag is wrapped with the user’s iCloud Security Code and\n  the public key of the hardware security module (HSM) cluster that will store the\n  escrow record. This becomes the user’s iCloud Escrow Record.\n\nNote that the iCloud Security Code refers here either to your device passcode or the code you set up if you don't have 2FA enabled. Now take a look at how the document explains recovering an escrowed keychain:\n\nTo recover a Keychain, users must authenticate with their iCloud account and\n  password and respond to an SMS sent to their registered phone number. Once\n  this is done, users must enter their iCloud Security Code. The HSM cluster\n  verifies that a user knows their iCloud Security Code using the Secure Remote\n  Password (SRP) protocol; the code itself isn’t sent to Apple. Each member of\n  the cluster independently verifies that the user hasn’t exceeded the maximum\n  number of attempts allowed to retrieve their record, as discussed below. If\n  a majority agree, the cluster unwraps the escrow record and sends it to the\n  user’s device.\n\nSo there are multiple steps here:\n1) You authenticate with your iCloud account information\n2) You then respond to an SMS sent to your previously registered phone number\n3) You enter your iCloud Security Code (or device passcode in the case of 2FA).\nNote specifically it says that this code is NOT sent to Apple. Instead your code is verified using the Secure Remote Password protocol. I'm not an expert in crypto so I can't explain the details to you, but what's important to note is that SRP allows verification of passwords without sending the password itself or any equivalent data.\nOnce this is done, your device now gets the encrypted keychain, and must still decrypt it using your iCloud Security Code (or device passcode). But that is all done on the local device. \nTo sum it all up, if you have 2FA enabled, and you turn on key chain escrow when enabling your icloud keychain syncing, will use your device passcode as part of the Keychain escrow security, but that passcode never leaves your device.\n", "Q: Is there any danger to relaunching Finder while external drives are connected? I tried to do a very large copy (2TB) by copy/paste to two external drives. It hung up on the \"Preparing to copy\" dialog. After about 20 hours of waiting, I cancelled and that also seems to hang.\nCan I unmount these drives, and/or can I relaunch Finder without worry to the data on the drives?\n\nA: You can relaunch Finder without any worry, yes. Relaunching Finder won't unmount/remount the drives or anything like that. The copy operation you had started would be cancelled though.\nWhether or not you can directly unmount the drives depends on whether any programs have files open on the drives. You would need to close those files (or the programs) before you can unmount the drives properly.\n", "Q: Preserve app data when moving to new Apple ID (complication: can't log in to old Apple ID) I need to set up a new phone with a new Apple ID for a friend. We're facing two technical problems: \n\n\n*\n\n*We need to preserve some data from the old phone (specifically, the WhatsApp chat log). \n\n*We don't know the password to the Apple ID the old phone is linked to.\n\n\nCurrent situation: We have the old phone (associated with the old account), and we have successfully updated it to the latest iOS version and backed it up via iTunes. The old phone does not have iCloud services/backup activated. \nWe have the new phone (factory reset), updated to the same iOS version (11.2.2).\nI was able to successfully restore the backup to the new phone. However, in order to install the apps (and thus access their data) from the old phone, they need to be downloaded with the old Apple ID, for which we don't have the password (and no way of resetting it either).\nIf I bind the phone to the new Apple ID, I have to delete and reinstall WhatsApp, so the chat logs will be gone. Is there any way to back them up and restore them to the new ID (the phone number/SIM card remains the same)?\n\nA: You could try backing up the old iPhone's WhatsApp chats to iCloud. This is a feature of WhatsApp and would only backup and recover WhatsApp Data. This is different from the 'normal' iCloud backup, which backups App Data.\nThe WhatsApp feature is described here: https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/iphone/20888066/#backup\nTo backup the chats to iCloud:\n\nTo make a manual backup of your chats at any time, go to WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat Backup and tap Back Up Now.\n  This will back up your chats and media to your iCloud account; you can choose to include or exclude videos from the backup. \n\nTo recover the chat history on the other iPhone:\n\nTo recover your chat history from an iCloud backup, first verify that an iCloud backup exists in WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat Backup. If you can see when the last backup was performed, delete and reinstall the app from the App Store. After verifying your phone number, follow the on-screen prompts to restore your chat history. The same iCloud backup requirements apply for iCloud restore. In addition, the phone number used for backing up and restoring must be the same. \n\nThis should work to manually backup WhatsApp data to iCloud.\n\nA: What I did was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up the old phone\n\n*Remove SIM and put it into the new (factory reset) phone\n\n*Restore the backup on the new phone (with the old Apple ID still active)\n\n*Cancel all the password requests (one for each app the phone tries to download)\n\n*Delete all the apps on the new phone\n\n*Log off on the old phone and log in with the new Apple ID (answering Yes to the question whether I want to merge my data with iCloud)\n\n*Enable iCloud on the old phone\n\n*Enable Chat backup in WhatsApp on the old phone, do a complete backup\n\n*Log off on the new phone and log in with the new Apple ID (answering Yes to the same question)\n\n*Open the App Store and download WhatsApp with the new Apple ID\n\n*Start WhatsApp, link it to the new phone\n\n*Boom - all the chats were already there. Since there was about .5 GB of data, I'm sure that they had been there all the time (so they obviously were not deleted when I deleted the WhatsApp icon when I was still signed on with the old Apple ID). But if they hadn't been, they would have been restorable from iCloud.\n\n\nPhew! That's a big relief.\n", "Q: `scutil --nc start` VPN not working - macOS 10.13 High Sierra Problem\nMy VPN dis-/connect workflow script \nscutil --nc start \"My VPN connection\"\n\nisn't working since upgrading to macOS High Sierra (stable Version, v10.13.2).\nDetails\nContext\nI used an Alfred workflow to connect to my VPN connections which uses scutil command under the hood.\nDialog with error message\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2861556/31211266-02d886dc-a998-11e7-952a-e1409d882a59.png\n\nTranslated to english: The IPsec certificate (shared secret) is missing.

(Didn't found detailed information about this)\n\n*Are there any new \"security related\" settings which I have to modify before switching to AppleScript approach?\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue on macOS 10.12.6.\nRoot cause was, that I also changed the configuration name of the VPN. \nAfter removing the old VPN and creating a VPN with another name and configuration \"Default\", it works with both the command \nscutil and networksetup\n\n", "Q: Where does Safari store passwords? I am having a very severe issue. I erased my Mac’s disk and reinstalled macOS High Sierra yesterday (I was already on High Sierra before reinstalling). I made copies of the drive before wiping it and I have all the data of the old disk at hand on external drives. (This is not a question about any kind of data loss, no loss occurred.)\nJust after my clean install I wanted to reinstall all the passwords I had saved in Safari (I just store them locally, without using iCloud sync). I was absolutely convinced they were stored in the session Keychain, so I just opened the clone of my old disk and then ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db and I almost had a heart attack when I saw they were not there. There was a lot of stuff, including my WiFi passwords, iMessage, App Store, Steam passwords, certificates and so on, everything was stored there EXCEPT all the Safari Internet passwords. \nSo I tried to copy the whole Keychains folder to my new install and replaced the new one with the old one. This had no impact. Still no passwords in Safari.\nBecause I don’t use sync services I have literally no way to access these passwords ever again if I don’t find the file where they were stored. Where does Safari 11 usually stores locally saved passwords on High Sierra? This is a very serious issue, I am locked out of literally everything including important documents.\n\nA: Your login keychain should be where your passwords are stored. But it's worth noting that there is a \"System\" keychain in /Library/Keychains as well. Additionally did you log out/restart and log back in after replacing the keychains?\n", "Q: Do applications install for all users or only for one? If I install a application using *.dmg image using user user1, it will be available when user2 log in as well? or it will be available only for user1 ?\n\nA: It depends where it installs to.\nIf it goes into the main Applications folder, then yes, it's available to all users - though each user will have their own distinct prefs, saved under their account.\nIf it's installed to /Users/[your name]/Applications, then it's only available to that user.\n", "Q: High Sierra Disk Utility problems I am using High Sierra (10.13.2, all updates in, including the one for Meltdown).  When I do one of my regular checks for disk health using the first aid in Disk Utility the whole process is (1) incredibly slow and (2) recently freezes my laptop altogether.  Given that I have a a 500GB SSD with 160 GB space, I am well surprised both by the drop in performance and now, by the fact I need to restart my laptop.\nIn the latest shenanigans disk utility was so slow that it passed the point when the screen goes off, and after that it was impossible to turn the screen on again (the mouse pointer was responsive).  Am I to assume that disk utility takes, say, 30 minutes now to run and during the check the computer will be utterly unresponsive?  How do I speed this process up, if at all possible?  \nDisk Utility always ended up causing the laptop to freeze for a small while, but here we are talking an abnormal amount of time.\n\nA: On HFS+, something is wrong for a less than TB sized Apple SSD to take 30 minutes to run a check. On APFS, it's slightly more complicated. Depending on how many snapshots you have, this might be normal but you'll need to get some details to know.\nIf you're on APFS - you'll need to look at the logs or enter to the command line to determine how many snapshots of the volumes exist. If your fsck is taking 2 minutes to run, but you have 30 snapshots - there goes an hour on a full fsck and no \"problem\" other than perception. On the other hand, an hour to check one snapshot and you're back in \"this is taking longer than usual by dozens of times\".\n\nI would get all the files backed up before you try to run the repair since a slow check almost always happens when storage is failing (but doesn't always correlate and certainly doesn't cause the failure itself).\nAt this point once you're backed up, you can take the fast path or the slower one:\nFast path - download the OS installer you want (High Sierra or whatever) and wipe the drive. When you are booted from an external USB, repair the drive twice to see if the second pass is faster than the first.\nIf you have issues with a wiped / empty drive - you can seek hardware service knowing that your data is backed up.\nThe slower path is to still boot from another drive and just repair the drive. You might get a good read of the speedup or if your data and drive really take 30 minutes to check all the system structures.\nBooting to single user mode also might help in the short term and run /sbin/fsck -fy twice from the black screen to see if trimming the free blocks can help the storage allocate storage more efficiently.\n\nOn my MacBook that's been running High Sierra for quite some time, the single mode filesystem check reports 19 snapshots and that matches up with Time Machine:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots / | wc -l\n\nThe above list of local snapshots belonging to Time Machine counts 18 lines of output. None of the snapshots are more than an hour old as my Mac runs normally on power, with the external time machine destination connected so the snapshots cover the last day or so. I have seen it grow to 35 snapshots when I'm traveling and not doing hourly backups to the main time machine destination drive. They clean themselves up as far as I've observed in all cases.\n", "Q: OS X Safari: Toggle Socks Proxy from command line I need to toggle back and forth between engaging and disengaging a socks proxy within Safari:\n\nNext open safari and click on \"safari\" in the top left menu bar to\n  open the drop down menu and then click on preferences. You can do the\n  same thing by pressing CMD+,. Click on the advanced tab and find\n  \"Proxies\", click \"Change Settings\". System Preferences should open and\n  you can now select \"SOCKS Proxy\". You should be setup and if you check\n  google for your IP it should be masked by the address that you're\n  SSH'd into. Note this is system wide and will cover all network\n  communications. You can turn this off by unselecting the SOCKS Proxy.\n\nIs it possible to perform this task with a script?  Bonus round: add button or menu item to Safari UI to execute proxy toggle.   Any feedback to clarify question is appreciated.\n\nA: To turn on SOCKS proxy for the network service called Wi-Fi, run\nnetworksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi on\n\nReplace ‘Wi-Fi’ with the name of your network service.\nReplace ‘on’ with ‘off’ to turn off the proxy.\n", "Q: Search returns only 'older' emails How do I fix my mail search feature on my Mac?\nSomehow my mail indexing has gotten \"frozen\" on my Mac (OS Sierra 10.12.6), so that messages newer than last June do not appear in searches.  \nThis happens for all my accounts (Exchange, IMAP and iCloud), using both Mail.app (Version 10.3 (3273)) and Outlook (Version 15.41 (171205)), and for all mailboxes (e.g. both Inbox and Sent). \nWhen I start typing characters in the search bar of the mail client, the only emails that appear are those older than ~6 months ago.  More recent emails do not appear in search results.  Even if I am looking right at a recent email, and enter the name of the person who sent it, it won't appear in the results.   \nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried rebuilding the Inbox to no effect -- even after waiting around for 10 minutes for it to re-download and re-index thousands of messages, I see the same behavior.\n\n*I've tried moving \"Envelope\\ Index*\" files in ~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData elsewhere to force re-indexing as per these instructions, but that simply resulted in an utterly blank list of emails and no searches were possible. \n\n*I have looked under System Preferences > Spotlight and Mail is checked.  Nothing is entered under the Privacy tab. \n\n\nIt is possible that this behavior is somehow a symptom of the iOS mail client on my iPhone; but an investigation of the phone's mail settings didn't reveal any help re. indexing.  The mail is still being left on the server, so it still appears in all my mail clients, it's just that search on my Mac is impossible for emails more recent than last summer.  Search on my iOS client works fine. \nAny help?  Thanks. \n\nA: Might it be the case of removing Mail & Messages and adding it back in to the System Preferences for Spotlight?\n\n", "Q: Live iPhone stream to laptop I am making a self-driving RC car to drive around a track for a school project.

One is a 2016 13\" MacBook Pro, the other a 2017 15\" MacBook Pro. On both of them, I have had to reinstall macOS High Sierra from the Recovery Tools. On both machines, it has taken over 5 hours to install.\nThese aren't the low-end Mac Pros, these are the maxed-out config-to-order, with upgraded processors, drives, and RAM. So it is unfathomable that it would take so long to install macOS High Sierra.\nI am currently waiting for the 15\" MacBook Pro to install High Sierra going on 6 hours now. The progress bar does move, but ever so slightly. The \"time remaining\" is always 1 hour +/- 30 or so minutes, but obviously that isn't accurate.\nSince posting this question, macOS is still sitting at 52 minutes remaining for the last hour. The progress bar has not moved a pixel.\nIt is normal for macOS High Sierra to install this slowly on these machines? If not, what can I do to reinstall the software more quickly?\n\nA: The one thing that I would say is that Apple has changed the recovery process somewhat in 10.13 High Sierra. Newer model Mac computers now have to pull down much more from Apple's side. \nWhat sort of internet connection are you on. 5 - 6 hours does sound pretty extreme but 2 - 3 hours I have seen in our lab at work for sure!\n\nA: Once you have a Mac up and running, goto the App Store and download High Sierra. This will download as an application. You can then transfer this application to a bootable USB flash drive. Booting and installing High Sierra from a flash drive is much faster and does not require any internet downloads. I would suggest using a USB 3 compatible flash drive, but USB 2 will also work. The instructions for making the USB flash drive installer can be found at the Apple website: How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\n", "Q: Code markup in Apple Notes app I am currently running macOS Sierra (10.12.6) and was wondering if there is an easy way to format code (like there is for Title, Heading, etc.) in Apple's Notes app?\nI'm open to any workarounds to achieve this. I would like to have syntax highlighting as you would see in a text editor (like Atom or Sublime).\n\nA: Note: I am in no way connected to any of these software.\nFree Options\nBoostnote is an open source project for writing notes with syntax highlighting. This is a good free alternative to using the native Notes app if you aren't against downloading an additional application.\n\nPaid Options\nQuiver provides features like LaTeX support, syntax highlighting, customizable themes, cloud syncing, and version control. As of writing this, it costs $9.99.\n\nBear provides syntax highlighting, easy exports (to PDF, .docx, HTML, JPG,  etc.), multiple themes, and syncing through iCloud. As of writing this, it costs $1.49 per month (if paid monthly) or $14.99 per year (if paid annually). If paying monthly, you will get a free one week trial.

I recently was convinced to update to the newest update (which I believe is 10.3.3), and ever since then, my phone has been bedeviled with issues. \nIt started with my phone constantly deleting my tabs after leaving Safari, then the Camera Roll being wiped (the photos eventually got restored, but this keeps happening multiple times), as well as my music, podcasts, and contacts being deleted off my phone. \nThe most recent issue, and the main one I'm asking about, is that my phone is absolutely refusing to download anything, which includes the previously-mentioned podcasts and music, but mainly any apps or updates. If I try, after a short while, an error message will come up saying 'Unable to Download'. \nI've done a lot of research, and tried basically everything recommended, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*restarting the phone\n\n*force rebooting the phone\n\n*force closing the App Store itself\n\n*signing in and out of my Apple ID\n\n*clearing-the-cache thing on the App Store\n\n\nNone of these actions fix the problem. Any suggestions on how else I can try to resolve this?\n\nA: I think your best course of action would be to commit to a factory reset after backing up your data.\nAccording to this support doc you can do so by plugging your device into a machine with iTunes installed, unlocking the device if it has a passcode and then clicking on it in iTunes.\nIn the device summary there should be a button that reads \"Restore iPhone...\" or something of the like. Click on that and then click Restore on the resulting new window to confirm your decision.\nYour device will then be erased and re-installed with a brand new factory image corresponding to the latest version of iOS available for your device.\n", "Q: Stolen MacBook Pro - Locating via Serial Number Someone has broken into my apartment and stolen my MacBook Pro and my roommate's Mac. Neither of the two devices was logged in to iCloud. Is there a way to track my device through its serial number? \n\nA: In short: No, you can't\nWhy?\nWell, according to Apple, Find My Mac is the only Apple service that can help track or locate a lost Mac. If you didn’t set up Find My Mac before your Mac was lost, you can’t locate it, this includes the serial number.\nWhat Can You Try? \n\n\n*\n\n*Your best bet would be to \"report your lost or stolen Mac to local law enforcement. They might request the serial number of your computer.\" - Apple.  \n\n*There are databases for submitting lost device's serial numbers, these alert buyers for example when a device is marked stolen. I'd recommend getting onto this as soon as possible.\nAt set up and with macOS upgrades, Apple almost forces all this additional security because it works. By default, services like the Find My Mac are checked, you would have had to make the conscious decision not to enable the service. Naturally, what isn't enabled can't be called upon.\n\nA: ProGrammer's answer is correct from my previous experience with Apple. But you can request a note attached to your Apple account stating that a device with that serial number was stolen. When the device is brought to the Apple Store for repair and the Apple employee enters the serial number, it will show up as stolen.\nSome Apple representatives will not tell you this and that you can do nothing unless you have \"Find My Mac\" enabled, which is true if you limit yourself to the iCloud system. You can request this extra step from the representative if you know about it.\nTo request a call with Apple, this page has no direct contact, so instead go to this page and choose \"The topic is not listed\", then write an explanation at the next page, e.g.:\n\nMy MacBook Pro computer was stolen and I want to give the serial numbers to Apple so it is black-listed.\n\nYou can and should also report the serial numbers on websites such as Immobilise.com . From talking to the Cambridgeshire police Constabulary:\n\nImmobilise.com is the main website we use, we don't use many others. It's also\nthe most secure. It's also used by cash converters and second hand goods: before\ntaking material, they check that website, and if they find a match, they call\nthe police straight away.\n\n", "Q: What is the optimal way of using a Mac with an ultrawide screen? I have an ultrawide screen (similar to this), which is connected to my Mac. I am looking for a way to split this screen into two or three virtual screens when needed, for easy multitasking. OSX does support screen splitting if you hold on the green button at the top of any screen, but it's very inconvenient because it takes a lot of clicks to switch which applications are currently displayed.\nIs there a better way to make efficient use of such a big screen?\n\nA: Been there before...\nCurrently, there is no way in MacOS to achieve true multi-monitor support on one display.

I have a jailbroken iPhone 6s, running iOS 9.3.3.\nAn \"Erase all content and settings\" will reset the phone, but will not \"un-jailbreak\" the phone. I know a factory restore will completely wipe the phone and update the iOS to the latest available (and hence remove the jalbreak), but I want to keep the iPhone on iOS 9.\nIs there a way I can un-jailbreak my phone, without having to update the software?\n\nA: You can use Cydia Eraser by Saurik to completely wipe and restore your device to stock iOS without updating.\n\nA: No you can't. The success of jaibreaking is to only do it on a device that doesnt receive updates often since updating erases the jailbreak. \nIf you are confident that the update that you wish to go to has a jailbreak (the most recent version of iOS as of the day you choose to update), then you should be ok to jailbreak it back again. That would be the only way to be updated and jailbroken, unfortunately I doubt there is a backup for the latest version of iOS.\n", "Q: How to automate Caps Lock Delay Removal in macOS MacBook Pro? I'll start with quoting another Stack Overflow user:\n\nApple's MacBook Pro has a slight delay on the caps lock key.

My old MacBook has many fonts that I need to sync to my new MacBook.  How do I figure out the ones that are missing, and sync them?\n\nA: Introduction\nThe Fonts included with the macOS operating system have not changed a whole lot over the years. As new (and highly customisable) fonts are made available to download and add to your FontBook, it indeed becomes difficult to remember which ones you have installed yourself and which were installed by the last macOS update. Having faced this issue for several years now, I  believe that I have found and implemented the best solution implemented across my various mac devices.\nThe Concept\nI have discovered that the following solution is both reliable and very easy to set up. It includes uploading the entire fonts folder on the mac to Dropbox. Already being a frequent user of the platform, I am a big believer in syncing my fonts this way because my Design projects live there permanently. The big advantage is that the work and fonts are all in one location (Dropbox) from where I can access them at any time without having to search the internet for that one awesome font I haven't installed locally on the end-device. If I share a project, I can also have instant access to include the fonts in the project files, making it super easy for the receiver of my work to continue.\nThe Setup\nYou can find these sorts of guides all over the internet but I have found this one to be the most reliable in terms of macOS changes.\nYour Mac: \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal in Applications/Utilities/\n\n*Run cd ~/Library to open your user Library.\n\n*Run sudo mv Fonts ~/Dropbox to move your Fonts folder to your Dropbox.\n\n*Enter your password when prompted.\n\n*Run ln -s ~/Dropbox/Fonts to create a symbolic link in your User Library.\n\n\nTarget Mac: \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal in Applications/Utilities/\n\n*Run cd ~/Library to open your user Library.\n\n*Run sudo rm -r Fonts to delete your user fonts folder.\n\n*Enter your password when prompted.\n\n*Run ln -s ~/Dropbox/Fonts to create a symbolic link in your User Library.\nThings to consider\nWhile this setup works well for my own purposes, you may like to thing about using a different cloud storage provider such as Google Drive or Apple's iCloud, which may work even better on other Apple devices.\nLet me know how you make out and whether you have any questions about this method in action. I am sure it would fit your needs and I'd be more than happy to follow up with you on this.\nFollow-up Additions \n\n\n*\n\n*This method essentially removes all Fonts from the mac and migrates them to Dropbox, then a link to the location is created, allowing any of your linked devices (or through the web interface) to add new/delete old fonts to/from your \"repository\".  \n\n*After the initial synchronization between Dropbox and the mac, you are able to disconnect from it because the font files have been synced to the Dropbox folder in your file system, much like every other cloud storage solution has that offline component. You may make changes to any content, once you connect to the internet, it syncs up and any changes push to all devices.  \n\n*If you are a one-off solution, I'd recommend not going to all the trouble of creating the symbolic link etc, and simply copying all the fonts to a folder on Dropbox or any other physical/cloud storage medium, deleting all fonts in the Fonts folder on the target machine and pasting all of them into the (now empty) Fonts folder.  \n\n*If you wish to keep existing ones, I have honestly not looked into that in too much detail as it wasn't applicable to my situation at the time. Apps like Compare Folders work really well when locating differences. I would suggest you check the source mac's Font folder against the target mac's Fonts folder and view the differences. This would allow you to pick out those that are not in the target folder. It isn't all as complicated as it sounds.\n\n\nA: The accepted answer worked for me, too, except that I don't use Dropbox but iCloud. These are instructions, providing that you don't have yet a folder called Fonts in your iCloud. I hope @ProGrammer won't mind if I copy instructions s/he got from mba.me:\nYour Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal in Applications/Utilities/\n\n*Run cd ~/Library to open your user Library.\n\n*Run sudo mv Fonts Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs to move your Fonts folder to your iCloud.\n\n*Enter your password when prompted.\n\n*Run ln -s Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Fonts to create a symbolic link in your User Library.\n\nTarget Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal in Applications/Utilities/\n\n*Run cd ~/Library to open your user Library.\n\n*Run sudo rm -r Fonts to delete your user fonts folder.\n\n*Enter your password when prompted.\n\n*Run ln -s Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Fonts to create a symbolic link in your User Library.\n\nI strongly recommend to back up your original fonts.\nBTW until Big Sur, this technique worked with a subfolder - I didn't need to replace the Fonts folder with a link but just put fonts on iCloud and then made a symbolic link in the Library/Fonts folder called iCloud:\n\n*\n\n*cd ~/Library\n\n*ln -s Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/Fonts Fonts/iCloud\nIt was less invasive technique but it was getting unstable in Catalina and stopped with macOS 11.\n\nA: If using the built in Font Book app is not enough for you, I would look at Adobe Creative Cloud to license fonts and typefaces or if you already have purchased or cleared licensing, Extensis has excellent tools to manage this for 2 machines or a small / large workgroup or enterprise.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.extensis.com/font-management-software\n\nA: If this is a 'one-time' activity, then there are plenty of file-syncing applications: Chronosync, Resilio Sync, GoodSync, etc -- which can be used to ensure that either or both Macs end up with either or both sets of files in the target folders.\nThese apps can also be used to run continuously, to ensure that the files stay in sync.\nBear in mind that Font Book does create status files in the font folders, which may have machine-specific information - encodings.dir, fonts.dir, fonts.scale, fonts.list - and copying these to another Mac may cause unforeseen problems.\nThird-party font management apps may allow you to store and enable fonts on network drives (licence permitting). Though all hell can break loose if the network connection isn't available.\n", "Q: How to change arrow keys to scrub not skip iTunes tracks? I need to know what text to enter into System Prefs / Keyboard / Shortcuts / App Shortcuts, but I can't find the command names in the iTunes menu bar, nor by hovering any of the UI for tooltips. \n\nA: I don't think you can set this behaviour anywhere in the preferences, but you can make this yourselves using Script Editor (installed on every mac) and FastScripts (get it here).\nBuilding the script:\nOpen Script editor, copy the following lines to two separate files, and save them both to ~/Library/Scripts/\nFirst:\n-- iTunes Skip 5\ntell application \"iTunes\" to set player position to (player position + 5)\n\nSecond:\n-- iTunes Back 5\ntell application \"iTunes\" to set player position to (player position - 5)\n\nSetting the keyboard shortcuts:\nDownload and open fastscripts. Now you'll find it in the top bar of your screen. Click on it, go to preferences and set your keyboard shortcuts. The arrow keys themselves are not possible to set, because they're already in use for skipping tracks, but a good alternative would be something like: fn + ctrl + rewind/forward\nSource: SixHat\n\nA: Use ⌘ + Option + (Left / Right) Arrow.\nFrom lifehacker.com.\n", "Q: iPhone regularly shows \"iPhone not activated...\" message I got a new iPhone 6 which is tied to a carrier and I currently am still using an old Samsung I have because I don’t want to waste the minutes (as I cannot transfer the plan from the iPhone to the Samsung). They both have different carriers, anyway.\nI have set up my iPhone a couple of weeks ago and recently it has been giving me a notification that pops up every 10 minutes saying “iPhone not activated please contact your carrier\".  \nI’ve been using my iPhone's iMessage and FaceTime (because I have an Apple ID and as long as being connected to Wi-Fi, I can use both).\nI looked up how to stop it and I’ve tried the airplane mode trick and it didn’t work, some say to take out your SIM card.\nMy questions \n\n\n*\n\n*If I take out the SIM card will I still be able to iMessage and FaceTime?  \n\n*Will my data be reset, what will happen to my storage?  \n\n\nIf anyone has an answer it will be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Have you contacted your carrier, as suggested?\nFirst Question\nI believe that this page may help your case. From what I know, iMessage and FaceTime will not work on non-activated devices. You will need to first determine whether your device is really not activated or whether the message is randomly appearing although the iPhone is activated. Follow this guide to check.\nSecond Question\nTo address the second question, I am assuming that data refers to your iPhone's internal storage and not the cell carrier/mobile plan related data that allows you to browse the web.\n\n*\n\n*Removing the SIM card does not delete the iPhone's internal storage, thus you do not need to worry about data-loss during the procedure because storage is not related to activation. The only case in which this would occur is if the device is fully reset.\n\n*You should have a current backup of your iPhone. You mentioned that iMessage and FaceTime are operable, so I assume you back up to iCloud or at least to your computer via iTunes. No matter what you try, a full backup will always come in handy if everything fails.\n\n", "Q: iCloud removes my third-party ePubs and PDFs from my iPad without permission — how do I stop this? I had to pawn my iPad for a bit, so I uploaded all of my third-party books to iCloud and of course, when I turned iCloud off, the material was removed from the device. Now that I have it back I naturally want to download my entire library to my device again. At first it let me download about half of my library, but when I tried to download any more, suddenly all of my books were pulled back onto the Cloud. I assumed it was a storage issue, and gave myself another gigabyte of space... NOW, not only did the problem continue but it’s actually gotten worse: iCloud periodically pulls back any book I try to download. It doesn’t even notify me, let alone asks permission — it just does it and the cloud symbol suddenly appears.  \nIs there some setting I got jacked up or what?\n\nA: It sounds like you have \"Automatically Manage Storage\" turned on in the preferences. If the device is almost filled up, then iOS could be deleting iBooks that are available from your iCloud account from the device.\nYou can re-download them from iCloud when needed. Bookmarks, placemarks, etc. are also saved into iCloud.\n", "Q: Kernel panic during sleep mode 4 days ago my 2017 MacBook Pro started exhibiting a strange behaviour. Basically when it's in sleep mode, it crashes and when I open it I have to boot it again and the report shows a kernel panic, that is almost always identical, that says something like\nFatal error occurred. CSTS=0xffffffff\n. FW Revision=CXS4JA0Q\\n\"@/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/IONVMeFamily/IONVMeFamily-356.30.6/IONVMeController.cpp:5275\n\nI haven't installed anything new in these days, I resetted the NVRAM, the RMC, I did diagnostic and first aid on the SSD, the problem is still there. Maybe it is also worth noting that the very first time that it happened there was also a flashing box with a question mark, but this happened only the first time.\nRight now I have installed an app, Insomnia X, that prevents the laptop to go in sleep mode when I close the lid, but I would like to solve this problem. \nI'm hesitant to visit the Apple Store to check the hardware as I cannot go until the end of the month.\nIs there a way to know if this is software or hardware in the mean time?\n\nA: Try booting the MacBook Pro into Recovery or Internet Recovery mode (hold down cmd-R when booting for Recovery mode, or option-cmd-R for Internet Recovery mode).\nNow you have booted in a \"known good\" configuration of software which is unaffected by any changed you may have made to the normal operating system on the Mac.\nIf sleep mode works fine here without kernel panics - you'll know that you have a software related problem.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 can't take pictures in winter It is impossible to take photos with my iPhone 6 in winter. Temperature can be from 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) to minus 10  Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) i.e. not very low. Phone just turns off without any explanation. I can warm it inside my pocket or coat and take out only for few photos -- it doesn't help.\nOnce in room it recovers.\nOther phones and cameras work well in such conditions.\nHow to solve this? I suspect they just put some explicit trigger inside.\n\nA: I highly doubt that they put an explicit trigger inside your device only. My iPhone 6 works fine in the cold.\nIt is however likely that you could help the problem by replacing the battery in your device. Sudden shutdown is most often caused by battery related problems.\n", "Q: On iPad Pro, does some apps stay full screen even when working in a 2 app side-by-side mode? Because Pokemon Go has a bug on the iPad version and I cannot see the number of Pokeballs remaining to catch a Raid Boss (due to aspect ratio of iPad about 4:3, not the same as iPhone's 16:9), so I want to use the 2-app-side-by-side method to see if I can somehow change the aspect ratio of the app.\nSo I either run Pokemon Go and slide in a Safari, or run the Safari and slide in Pokemon Go.  (By running Pokemon Go, and then slide from bottom up of the screen to see the dock, and then touch-and-hold an app and move it to the edge of the main screen area).\nEither case, I see Pokemon Go running as a full screen app.  Is it true? Some apps cannot run as a side-by-side app but must remain full screen?\n\nA: Yes, that is true. The app must be compatible to run side-by-side - and if the app is not, there's nothing users can do about it other than encourage the developers to add the support.\n", "Q: Is the Force Touch Trackpad on MacBook Pro supposed to be 'nudged' with a mechanical clicking sound? Yesterday I received a brand new MacBook Pro Touch Mid-2017 with Touchbar, which was built-to-order.\nBefore even passing through the setup screens, I noticed that the Force Touch Trackpad gives away a mechanical thud/clicking sound at each press. At every press, the Trackpad is nudged down/slightly lowered, and this is what creates the mechanical sound. The same thing happens regardless of where on the Force Trackpad's area I press.\nI was under the impression that Trackpad are supposed to be non-movable and completely static, and that any tactile and audio feedback is purely from the haptic engine and speakers. I am entirely sure that the sound is mechanical and coming from the Trackpad, not the speakers.\nIs this a manufacturing problem?\nHere is a video of the sound (the nudge is very slight so it may not be visible in the video): https://youtu.be/gyIG8gAn6B0\n\nA: The video quality is such that the nudge is not really visible. But yes, the intention is that the trackpad should not physically move in normal circumstances.\nThe clicking sound on the video however sounds pretty much like it should. The sound is generated by the computer - it is not mechanical.\nYou could consider taking the computer to a store and comparing the sound with another MacBook Pro.\n\nA: After going to a Mac store and comparing the click of the Force Touch Trackpad to those of other Macs, I have reached the conclusion that the nudge and sound is normal.\nHowever, all of the Force Touch Trackpads I pressed on, did in fact nudge downwards ever so slightly in the way I mentioned – on both MacBooks and MacBook Pros. I don't know if the haptic engine was responsible for this, but to me it was very clear that there is a visibly small nudge downwards and not just a tactile feedback (like 3D touch on iPhones for instance). So the claim that Force Touch Trackpads don't move at all, to me appears misconstruing.\n\nA: It is normal, check another of the latest MacBook Pros. The trackpad is not moving. An haptic feedback is generated so you can feel the click, and a click sound is generated as an audio confirmation that you actually did click on something. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: how do i stop the predictive typing suggestions I have an iPad Pro running ios 11.2.2...and, I can turn off the gray bar using the  “general>keyboard>predictive” switch...but the prediction just pops up in a bubble next to where i am typing.\nthis is a SIGNIFICANT SECURITY ISSUE as password predictions pop up when the first or second letter is typed...anyone using the device can easily see any password that i regularly use...so, how do I stop the predictions from occuring?\n\nA: Prediction and autocorrect are two different features. What you are describing is autocorrect. You can disable autocorrect by following:\nSettings > General > Keyboard > Toggle Auto Correction off. \nThe issue you are describing however sounds like it stems from you accidentally entering a password into a plain text field which has been added to the autocorrect dictionary. You might try resetting the dictionary first to see if it resolves your problem:\nSettings > General > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary.\n", "Q: Extend main APFS partition fails with \"target disk is too small for this operation\" /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         125.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Storage                 100.0 GB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +125.7 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            122.9 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 19.9 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                506.6 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n\nI checked the different similar questions and tried the suggested solutions but in vain.

The command you issued can not reclaim the free space back into disk0s2, because there little or no free space between disk0s2 and disk0s3. To reclaim approximately 25 GB of free space back to disk0s2, you would need to execute the following procedure.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the files from disk0s3.\n\n*Delete disk disk0s3. You can use the command given below.\nsudo diskutil  eraseVolume free none disk0s3\n\n\n*Add the approximately 125 GB of free space to disk0s2. You can use the command given below.\n sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nBasically, it come down to this. If the files on disk0s3 are important, then you are going to need an external drive to temporarily store them. Once all the space has been returned to disk0s2, you can either create a new disk0s3 or create another APFS volume on disk0s2. Finally, restore the files from the external drive.\n", "Q: Reactivate AFP von Mac High Sierra OS X Server (10.13) I am having trouble with my High Sierra OS X Server's file sharing volumes.

It has Mac OS 10.x installed (actually it has 3 versions installed for whatever reason).\nThe problem is that he has no idea what his user name and passwords are.\nSo I would like to re-install a fresh OS and setup the mac mini.\nIt is not the first time, that I do this, so I do press for sure the right keys while starting up.\nI tried booting the system holding down the apple key + r without success. The system will boot into the primary installation.\nWith Command + Apple + r it is the same.\nI can reset VRAM using Command Command + Apple + r + p and I hear the chime sound.\nPressing any other combinations doesn't let me hear any sounds.\nSo I wondered and created a bootable stick with MAC OS Sierra on it. Just to make sure my old mac mini can handle it. \nWhile booting up and pressing command I can choose between the installed Versions of MAC OS or install Sierry from USB.\nWhen I choose to install from USB the Mac Mini will simply boot into the installed Mac OS.\nI remember that on an old windows PC I wasn't able to install from USB even though he recognized the USB Stick. I had to do that from DVD / CD. \nWhat do you think, do I have to use a DVD/CD to finally install any OS?\nSince I don't don't have the option to burn a disc here I wasn't able to try out yet. Maybe there is another solution?\n\nA: First step is to erase the non volatile ram (used to be called PRAM) by holding Command-Option-P-R and listen for two boot chimes in a row then release the keys and try the install.\nFor an erase install, you need to boot to the installer and then choose Disk Utility from the Utilities menu and literally erase the drive. I would physically disconnect my backup if any before doing the erase. At that point, NVRAM or not - the system can’t boot from the erased drive and will make your life easier to select the correct installer and get a clean new OS.\n\nA: Yes RayofCommand, after you release alt-cmd-P-R the machine goes on booting from whatever boot partition was selected, as usual. Cmd-R won't work on a Mac with an old version of OS X because the recovery partition is missing. I don't think a white mini will boot from USB, but you could connect it to another Mac thru a Firewire cable, boot this white mini holding the T key (\"target disk mode\"): the mini's internal hard disk will be mounted on the other mac's desktop. From there you can wipe the disk with Disk Utility. After that, the problem is installing an old version os OS X on the disk... old OS X installers won't work on the second Mac if it's on High Sierra or any recent OS X version. You could clone another disk (with the desired OS version installed) on mini's internal disk using Disk Utility (or Carbon Copy/Super Duper, that's what I usually do), or even create two partitions on it (one small, say 8 GB, and one with the remaining space) and clone the installer volume you have on the USB stick on this small partition. Then start the mini with alt pressed and boot from this partition, install on the other bigger partition. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: reduce trackpad sensitivity when typing (MacBook Pro w/ Retina) When I type on my MacBook Pro, I tend to rest my palms near the trackpad - and sometimes they end up touching the trackpad directly.\nAs a result sometimes I end up moving the mouse around while typing. The worst is when it ends up highlighting text I've already typed, then I end up typing over it. This happens a lot.\nHow can I reduce the trackpad sensitivity to touch? On Dell computers the mouse utility actually lets you adjust this. It's a setting like \"TouchGuard\" or something, and if you turn it up this problem won't happen, though there will be a noticeable delay when you try to actually use the mouse.\nI cannot find any similar setting on my MacBook Pro.

They're driving me NUTS. But I'm job hunting and don't want all my calls to go directly to voicemail...is there any way I can put just this person on DND?\nThe thing is, I don't want to hurt their feelings by \"ignoring\" their calls every time. I'd rather them think my phone is off completely. I read that going into messages and turning off notifications would work, but it didn't. I've tried talking to them about it, but they aren't getting the hint and I don't want to resort to being mean. \n\nA: There is a 3rd party app called YouMail. The free versiin of it will allow you to set different conditions for different contacts. You can change which voicemail message someone gets. You can send a certain contact directly to voicemail. And you can also prevent callers from being able to leave a voicemessage. I had someone who would also call me 4-8 times in a row and no matter how many times I asked him to stop and explained why, he just kept doing it. With him, I would vary between the silent ringtone strategy mentioned by Tyson and YouMail’s ditch call.\n", "Q: My MacBook Air won't stay on unless it its plugged in My MacBook Air will not keep charge unless it is plugged in. However it started right after I spilled some water on it. Went in through the Trackpad and keyboard. I thought it was completely dead, but I then plugged it in and it turned on. But it does shut off when you unplug it. If I keep it plugged in, it will not run certain games as it will get too hot and shut off. Everything works fine, Except for the battery. It only charges up to 20% and the status of the battery is \"Replace Now\" I suspected that maybe it was just the battery and nothing else was wrong, but I went to the apple store and they did a quick check and they said that I am lucky it even still turns on because of all of the damages. They also said it will take as LITTLE as $800 to fix it. They claim it is more than the battery. But I suspect that battery replacement will fix it. Maybe not completely but at least to a point of it being semi functional. But what do you think? Is it just the battery? Or something more?\n\nA: This is typical when the current isn’t enough to run the computer.\nIf you hadn’t had liquid damage, I’d recommend the following:\n\nIf you think of a battery storing electrons as a tank stores water - the current is how much volume can come out of the tap. The voltage is the pressure at which the water exits the tap. The battery being “full” or charged is simply the total volume in the tank being “full” regardless of how much pressure and/or volume can come out right now.\nTake it in for service or plan to replace the battery would be the logical next steps when your computer doesn’t work with the battery it has.\n\nSince you have liquid damage, I wouldn’t spend any money on the battery since corrosion is likely and you should either pay for a total rebuild of this Mac or keep a good backup until it no longer works at all and replace it.\n\n\n*\n\n*No sound (speakers/jack) + microphone's dead after spilling water\nLike the linked question - it’s not clear if your battery is the problem or your logic board is pulling too much current or has other problems. Liquid damage can do that - break all sorts of things or multiple sorts of things. The liquid also could be totally external and no damage whatsoever - you have to open and inspect all the parts to know and that’s about an hour of trained technician time in most cases to open / look / close everything.\n", "Q: How to perform a \"Clean Install\" these days? Long ago, back in the OS 7 and earlier days, it was a snap to perform what was formally called a \"Clean Install\" of the OS.  It would utterly remove the OS and place a brand-spanking new one in its place.  Applications and data (other than system preferences and such) would be untouched, and you rarely even had to reinstall a single application.  Adjust a few system prefs and you were good as new in no time at all.\nI believe this feature went away around OS 8, and since then I've never known of a good way to perform a clean install.  Migration Assistant is useless and ranting about it is unhelpful here.\nI have a mid-2011 iMac, running \"low\" Sierra from an external SSD (Thunderbolt).  I've got vestiges of Mavericks and all kinds of applications I no longer use floating around, and I feel that it's time to clean up.  But every time I've done this in every flavor of OS X, it's ended up being an utter nightmare of lost application files (prefs, extensions, etc.), lost system settings, lost chat logs (Messages, Skype, etc.) and so much more.  It's as bad to clean my Mac these days as it always had been on Windows!\nMy approach to date has been to install a fresh OS on a newly created partition of my drive, and go through countless reboots back & forth between the two systems while I copy applications and their preferences and settings over.  Still it's inevitable that something will get lost or not be able to transfer over like mail rules, chat histories, or all manner of other stuff.  Eventually I can delete the original partition once I'm confident in the migration (though there are often problems doing that, too!)\nSo is there a \"best practice\" or reliable way to completely replace my current macOS Sierra installation with a fresh copy, without losing any application data including preferences, mail & chat histories, app settings, etc.?  I'm OK with having to reset basic system settings as I expect that, but losing anything related to my user-installed applications, is really quite unacceptable IMO.\n\nA: The functionality you're looking for that is closest to the Clean Installation option in the old Mac OS 'System' days is the Reinstall macOS option available from Recovery mode.\nSee my A bit of history info at end on what the old Clean Installation option was and how it differs slightly from the Reinstall macOS option today.\nReinstalling macOS without deleting applications, data, etc\nPrior to following this process, you need to ensure:\n\n\n*\n\n*you have a known good backup of all your data (be it via Time Machine or another process) just in case something goes wrong\n\n*your iMac is able to connect to the internet during the installation process\n\n\nAssuming you have the above sorted, follow these steps to reinstall macOS without deleting your apps, data, etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your iMac\n\n*Power up your iMac and immediately press and hold the commandR keys\n\n*Let go of the keys when it's clear you're booting into Recovery mode\n\n*Soon the macOS Utilities window will appear\n\n*Make sure your iMac is connected to the internet\n\n*Now choose the Reinstall macOS option \n\n*Click the Continue button\n\n*Follow the prompts (to select your disk, etc)\n\n*Click the Install button\n\n\nOnce completed, your iMac will restart as normal. This process does not erase your drive and therefore all your apps and data should still be in place. In other words, this process does nothing but reinstall macOS over the previous version on your drive.\n\nA bit of history \nIn the old Mac OS System days users were presented with three options when installing system software:\n\n\n*\n\n*normal (“easy”) installation - this automatically installed all the Mac OS system software appropriate for that particular model of Mac\n\n*“clean” installation - (see more details below)\n\n*custom installation - this allowed users to select a specific combination of system software files or to install/update specific files\n\n\nThe old clean installation option was actually designed as a troubleshooting option. This allowed users to discover which item(s) in their original System Folder was causing problems. A clean installation created a brand new System Folder and saved everything in the original System Folder to a different location. It also left user data (and user installed apps) alone. Users could then reinstall system extensions, control panels, etc one at a time from the old System Folder to the new System Folder. This procedure allowed users to determine which item in the old System Folder was the source of a problem. \nIn Apple's own words: \n\nPerform a clean installation if you can’t determine what is damaged in\n  your System Folder (especially if you think any special software, such\n  as control panels, system extensions, or custom utilities, may be\n  causing the problems you’re experiencing). You should also perform a\n  clean installation if you’re still having problems with your computer\n  after you’ve reinstalled system software by performing a normal\n  installation.\n\nSource: Mac OS 7.1 Installation manual \nToday a clean installation has a totally different meaning (even to Apple) to what it did back then. Today a clean installation involves erasing the Mac's startup drive and starting afresh with a totally new installation of macOS, meaning users have to rely on a backup and/or installers to transfer any data or software over. Today's Reinstall macOS option accessible via Recovery Mode is the closest option to replicating the old clean installation option.\nWhere this differs is that the old option actually kept everything in the original System Folder by copying it to another location so users could move system items (e.g. control panels, system extensions, etc) back one by one to try and determine what was causing problems. This was a troubleshooting process of elimination option.\nToday's Reinstall macOS option is not designed so much for troubleshooting as it is simply to reinstall macOS over an existing installation without having to install/migrate apps, data etc. \nHowever, if you're installing a new drive or migrating to a new Mac, then users will need to use Time Machine / Migration Assistant instead (or another backup option) in order to migrate apps and data.\n", "Q: How to change resolution of external monitor from main monitor on Macbook Pro? I have a Macbook Pro with the four USB-C / thunderbolt ports, running High Sierra. I have a USB-C to DVI cable. I have tried an old 1680x1050 monitor connected it which works fine. However another 2560x1440 monitor does not; it just doesn't display anything when connected, the same as having no signal. That monitor works fine when connected to a PC at full resolution with a DVI to DVI cable.\nI'm pretty sure this is because the resolution is too high for the cable. When I change it to mirror the displays in the System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement settings, I can control the resolution of the external monitor from the main laptop screen and set it to 1920x1080 and it works fine. However, as soon as I set it back to not be mirrored, the setting for the external monitor goes back to being displayed on that monitor at the max resolution where I can't see it.\nMaybe I should have got a better cable, but being able to change the resolution for the time being seems like it should be really simple, but I don't seem to be able to do it.\nThanks\n\nA: Try clicking on 'Gather Windows' button in the bottom right corner. It will bring the resolution choices onto the built-in screen. Then you can choose one that suits. If you hold down option while clicking the 'scaled' button, it will bring up all available resolutions.\nI have a third party screen, but Mac picked it up as an Apple screen with unusual resolutions and all I could see were grey streaks. Once I gathered the windows and changed to a suitable resolution it worked fine. \n\nA: In System/Preferences/Monitor, under the Monitor tab, there's a button for gathering all Monitor windows (there's one displayed for each connected monitor) on the current monitor; then you can choose the other monitor's resolution (\"resized\", eventually) using the current monitor. If the needed resolution is not available, try googling for SwitchResX, SetResX (both shareware) or scrutil (command line tool) or ChangeResolution (script). Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Get unlock passcode of a jailbroken iPad/iPhone using TransLock Bruteforce Tool I have a jailbroken iPad 3 that I haven't touched in a couple of years, and forgot the 4-digit passcode. The MacBook Pro that I used to backup and sync the iPad recently crashed. So, I cannot connect and restore the iPad without losing my precious data; particularly a book's manuscript that I was partially writing in Notes.\nAfter 9 failed attempts, I am down to my last attempt before the iPad is locked. I've tried numerous applications to try and backup the iPad in DFU/Restore mode to no avail.\nThen I came across: Majd Alfhaily's post http://blog.alfhaily.me/2015/03/bruteforce/ where he was able to accomplish the exact task that I am trying to do using his TransLock Brutefore tool. I tried to replicate his work, but my programming skills are limited. I got as far as downloading his libTransLock file on my GitHub...(https://github.com/freemanrepo/libTransLock).\nDoes anyone know how to compile or execute his work? Has anyone else been successful at bypassing the passcode on a jailbroken iPad/ iPhone using TransLock or another tool? Any comments or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: libTransLock is a tweak you'll need to compile with Theos and install on the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Theos.\n\n*Clone libTransLock to a folder on your computer.\n\n*Connect your jailbroken device with USB.\n\n*Run make package install in the cloned folder.\n\n*SSH into your jailbroken device.\n\n*Run tail -f /var/log/syslog on your device to watch the syslog.

I tried to find a solution but all of them are about trying to install cli-tools without Xcode. All of them eventually require the internet connection. My case is that I want to install cli-tools on a completely offline machine which was never connected to the Internet. Thus the only option is to install from files brought using USB flash.\n\nA: You have to obtain the tools somehow. Officially you need to have access to the developer download pages at Apple. For the lowest point of entry a valid AppleID seems to suffice for that.\nThen you go to the relevant download section on Apple's developer site and choose the appropriate version and download the DMG you need. That file can then be copied to your liking and for example transferred via flash drive.\n\nA: Just package up  /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools with your deployment tool of choice (it could be as simple as using Finder to compress / zip / archive the folder or as complicated as making a signed package with an installer and receipts so you know the install status / checksum of the files, etc...)\nOf course, someone needs to run xcode-select --install while connected to the internet to grab the current binaries, but there's nothing preventing you from deploying that one set of tools you download later offline.\nSee - How do I uninstall the command line tools for Xcode?\n\nA: You can probably do this with AutoDMG by including XCode in your image.\n", "Q: Shell script from Applescript This has been driving me crazy.

I am really worried about heat damage because the T Junction rate is 105°C so is my CPU's PECI temperature supposed to be like this? Should I worry?\n\nA: No, there's no need to worry.\nThe CPU will automatically shutdown before reaching a critical temperature that could damage the CPU. There you do not need to worry about imminent heat damage.\nIn addition to automatic shutdown, throttling is almost always also used before the critical temperature is reached to ensure that you avoid the shutdown.\nTherefore - if you're not experiencing that the computer shuts down unexpectedly under high load, and your computer is functioning at reasonably normal speeds - there's really nothing to worry about.\nI won't focus to much on the specific 105 degrees measurement. First of all the measurement software you're using might not be fully precise (PECI temperatures are always negative and an offset from critical temperature - not an absolute measurement like yours, so the software you're using must be doing a conversion), secondly the specific TjunctionMax for your CPU is calibrated individually for each CPU in the factory. So your TjunctionMax might not be 105 degrees, but rather 106 degrees or something else.\n", "Q: Use more than one PS4 Dualshock controller over bluetooth I have two Playstation 4 Dualshock controllers and am thinking of getting two more. They have both bluetooth and usb connections, but prefer bluetooth to avoid cable salad — and of course to be able to conveniently play games on the big screen from the couch. Am thus far unable to use both wirelessly at the same time.\nHow to connect and use both controllers using bluetooth at the same time?\n\n*\n\n*Tested on macOS High Sierra (10.13) and macOS Sierra (10.12) on two separate 2015 model Macbooks.\n\n*Can pair with both controllers individually, if turning bluetooth off/on between.\n\n*Cannot connect with both at the same time.\n\nAs soon as one controller is connected, the other is basically ignored. As soon as the first controller is disconnected, the second one can be connected, and vice versa.\nWould prefer not to use third-party (especially closed source) software, nor do I want to buy additional hardware.\nNote: using Apple's Bluetooth Explorer (part of Hardware IO Tools for Xcode, Apple Developer login required) I can reset the bluetooth stack, clear device caches, restart blued etcetera. This has not helped in this case, but am also not familiar enough with this advanced tool to know all the tricks.\n\nA: I've so far been unable to use 2 PS4 Dualshock controllers over Bluetooth with my 2016 Macbook Pro running Mojave. \nPairing either one with my mac would make the other unable to pair. Renaming the Wireless Controller connection to something more decent did not help.\nWhat helped somewhat was upgrading to the dreaded Catalina - I was able to pair both controllers BUT couldn't play any games with them. The games didn't consistently receive commands from either controller, I was unable to move any of the controlled characters more than a couple pixels on the screen, it was a nightmare. I assumed this was because the controllers kept interfering with one another\nWhat totally helped was replacing one of the PS4 controllers with an XBOX One wireless controller. This worked & fixed all issues, we got no more interferences, and the response time was fine. \nNote: all tested controllers were connected wirelessly via BT, games used were Cuphead and Knights & Bikes running on Steam.\n\nA: I successfully managed to connect up to 4 DualShock 4 v2 on my Mac mini 2012 running High Sierra 10.13.6 using an external Bluetooth Dongle (not with the builtin Mac mini BT controller).\nMultiple gamepads could not be connected simultaneously as described in the question. \nI purchased Mac-compatible Bluetooth USB dongles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Belkin F8T065bf (https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B009IQB3US)\n\n*Sena UD100-G03 (recommended for better BT range coverage - my Mac is enclosed in a locker.\n\n\nI highly recommend Sena UD100-G03 as I had issues with limited range coverage with the tiny Belkin F8T065bf.

This should be a UUID and I simply copied entryUUID. (My first thought was to map entryUUID directly, but it doesn't work - probably because it's a special attribute and not fetched, or not available for mapping.)\nTo be able to add the apple-generateduid you will also need to add the object class apple-user.\nAnd if these attributes/object classes are not known to your OpenLDAP, you probably have to import the Apple schema files first.\n", "Q: Office 365 installation stuck with one minute remaining on running package scripts I wiped and re-installed macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 on an older MacBook Air (11″, 2013).  Then I tried to download Office 365.  It got as far as \"one minute remaining\" on \"Running Package Scripts\", then it hung.  I tried force-quitting and re-starting.  It won't let me.  So I am stuck here. What can I do?\n\nA: The ‘running package scripts’ step does take a while and Installer is not able to accurately suggest how long this step will take. My guess is it wasn't ‘hung’ but you didn't wait long enough at that step — it can take numerous minutes and is working hard.\nYou can forcibly shut down the machine by holding the power button until the machine turns off. This wouldn't usually be necessary, but it probably is now, depending on the steps you took to attempt to interrupt the installation.\nI recommend attempting to install Office once again (as a partial installation isn't ideal) and letting the installer work through the steps it requires without attempting to interrupt it.\n\nA: If you go to applications in finder, click on the utilities folder and select activity monitor, you can make it finish by double clicking on installd, making it quit, and then it should immediately finish installing office!\n", "Q: How can I downloading a pdf file to someplace other than downloads When downloading a pdf file in Safari 11.0.2, can I save it in a particular file folder without first saving it in Downloads?\n\nA: Right click the link & 'Download Linked File as...'\n\n\nA: Yes, go to Safari preferences and select General.

The only way to do it from the online version is control+clicking every photo. So stupid\n\nA: Ok I found out the easiest way, total time takes about 10 minutes...\nFirst, move or delete all your old photo libraries in Photos app for Mac. I deleted mine because I had 3rd party backups, obviously you shouldn't delete them if you don't. If you move it and it still doesnt show up, just hold the Option key while you start Photos.\nOpen it fresh, and it will say it can't locate your library. Click \"Create New\".. name it something like GARBAGE or DELETEME.\nThen, go to settings and click 'set as system library', and also enable iCloud sync in settings (make your settings look like photo below). This will download all the photos fresh to this library (which doesnt have existing files so you dont have to worry about duplicates and such).\nIt will say \"Updating X photos\", make sure you wait for this step to finish.\nHowever, when it starts saying \"Downloading 10,000 photos\" then you can move to the next step, you dont have to wait as long as it gets past the 'updating' step.\nSelect all with command+A, then delete. Go to your trash and then delete again by clicking Delete All.\nIt will still be stuck saying \"downloading 10,000 photos\" although they should now start deleting from iCloud (It took about 5 mins for me before it started removing them)\nOnce its done removing from iCloud web, just close Photos, and delete the temp library on your harddrive. From there, hold option when you start Photos and choose 'create new'. Youll be starting with a 100% fresh iCloud now.\n\n\nA: Well, I made a small script which do the job. \n #NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.\n #Warn   ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.\n #SingleInstance force\n SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.\n SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.\n ^!z::\n Loop, 30\n {\n    Click\n    Sleep 1000\n     Send {Del}\n     Send {Tab}\n     Send {Enter}\n    Sleep 1000\n }\n\n^!z:: here is the hotkey that starts the script (Ctrl-Alt-Z) and 30 is a number of loop iterations (number of photos to delete).\nPrior to starting the script you should position mouse cursor on the upper left photo, for it to work.\n\nA: This is how you mass delete photos from icloud.com without having to hold down \"ctrl\" and clicking each picture one by one, which could take forever. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click the \"moments\" tab at the top center, so the photos are segregated by moments (location, date, etc).\n\n*On each moments section, look to the right hand side with your mouse pointer.

This worked GREAT!  The earlier Mac Pro had a TOSLINK output.  The new Mac Pro (2013) doesn't.\nPrior to that I has streamed iTunes wirelessly to the Apple TV which in turn connected by TOSLINK to the DAC.  This worked GREAT too!  When I set up this solution I had a TV monitor available that connected by HDMI to the Apple TV.\nUnfortunately, I have no other monitor or TV display available to connect to the Apple TV.\n\nProblems\n<< System Preferences >> << Sound >>\nIf I go to << System Preferences >> << Sound >> and look to \"Select a device for sound output\" I don't see the Apple TV connection via the HDMI.  Note, the Apple TV via the HDMI doesn't show up as an input either.\nI do see the Apple TV available for AirPlay, but when I select it a pop-up window appears asking me to: \"Enter the AirPlay code for \"Apple TV\"\nI assume the \"AirPlay code\" is not a \"password\" for the Apple TV (my Apple ID password doesn't work).

If I open iTunes and try to select an output device, I can select the Apple TV but the same pop-up window requesting the \"AirPlay code\" that I don't have a way to see appears.\nNote: I have a 27\" Apple Cinema Display, but it has not way to connect directly to the Apple TV.\nAgain, any suggestions much appreciated.\n\nFootnote -- If I had a shorter distance between the Mac Pro & the DAC I could use USB, but USB doesn't do well at distances beyond 20 feet.\n\nA: Contrary to what you write, the 2013 Mac Pro actually has TOSLINK output. The jack connector for the analog output doubles as an optical connection for digitally transferring the sound signal to your DAC.\nThis means that you can just use the TOSLINK solution that worked well for you before. You'll need a mini-TOSLINK to TOSLINK cable.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra 10.13 briefly flashes screen content last seen before locking the screen when awaken On macOS High Sierra 10.13.2, when I manually lock the screen (shift+ctrl+power) and later press any key to turn it on, the screen content which was shown at the time I locked the screen is briefly displayed on the screen (something like 1/30 or 1/60 of a second — I can measure it with high speed camera but it doesn't matter much) before it finally displays the login UI.\nI've never seen it before High Sierra, but now I can reproduce this 100% of the time. This is really annoying because this might allow a stranger to capture screen contents which were shown immediately before the screen was locked.\nI found one workaround which is far from perfect: lock the screen, wake up and press 'esc' to turn off the screen again. Then at the next wake up, nothing is revealed.\nIf I use cmd+ctrl+Q to lock the session as suggested in comments, it makes the bug less frequent, but doesn't really solve it.

Is it worth reporting to Apple as a security/privacy bug?\n\nA: Yes - the frame buffer should be scrubbed / discarded as part of the sleep / lock process no matter how brief the render. I don't think it's a huge risk and can be mitigated as you say by logging out of the screen before locking or any number of other ways like timed lockouts.\nThis may be fixed in Monterey 12.3, Big Sur and Catalina as CVE-2022-22656\nI'd just log out or enable fast user switching and switch away from the screen instead of letting the screen saver lock.\nApple publishes a page with instructions on how to report issues.

I am seeing TONS of authd : MacOS error -67050 and sometimes -67062. Sometimes I see this on taskgated and also iCal. \nWhat can I do to trace what causes this?\n\nA: This error occurs when unsigned code is run.  The taskgated process is the one checking if the executable is signed.  In order to check, it must open the file.  So to track down what is being opened by the process you can use dtruss (you may have install the Xcode command line tools to get it).  Just create the following file named unsigned.pl:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nopen my $fh, \"-|\", \"dtruss -p `ps -ef | grep taskgated | grep -v grep | awk '{print \\$2}'` -t open 2>&1\";\n\nwhile (my $line = <$fh>) {\n        my ($file) = $line =~ /open\\(\"(.*)\\\\0\"/;\n\n        next unless defined $file and -f $file;\n\n        my $signed = qx/codesign -dvvv \"$file\"/;\n\n        print $signed;\n}\n\nWhich can be run like this:\nsudo perl unsigned.pl\nand it will spit out lines like\n/path/to/executable: code object is not signed at all\n\nYou can then create a self signed cert with Keychain Access:\n\n*\n\n*launch the Keychain Access app\n\n*go to Keychain Access > Certificate Assistance > Create a Certificate...\n\n*set the name to something like codesigner\n\n*set the certificate type to Code Signing\n\n*create the cert\n\nOnce you have a self-signed cert you can sign the executables in the terminal with\ncodesign -s codesigner /path/to/executable\n\nNote: you will see a lot of examples using -f, but that forces it to be resigned with the new cert.  If you have lost access to the cert, or if the cert has expired, that might be necessary, but I try to avoid it.\n", "Q: Safari not prompting for basic authentication Our website provides hyperlinks to third-party software which requests basic authentication.  Previously a user would click the link, they would be taken to the new URL, and an authentication prompt would be shown.  On the recent update Safari no longer prompts for authentication, and users are given a 401 Unauthorised error immediately.  If you reload the page, it will prompt.  Pasting the URL directly into the address bar works correctly.\nThis is not due to caching or cookies.  I can confirm it was working fine in macOS Safari 11.0.1 and is broken in 11.0.2.  Chrome does not exhibit this behaviour.  I have also confirmed the same issue affecting iOS Safari, but I have not isolated versions.\nLoading a test page from my local HDD does not give the same problem, but when hosted via IIS (on our web server or on my development machine) it fails every time.  An example page is hosted here:\nhttps://go.itelescope.net/auth_test.html\nIt links to a test authentication server here (this test server does not display a 401 error, but it still should show the authentication dialog):\nhttp://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd\nHas anyone seen this before, or found a solution?  I'm also reporting this to Apple but since I'm not an Apple Developer I expect it to get lost in the noise.\nUpdate\nA user on the Apple Communities forum post I made has said this is a design decision by Apple, but I have yet to get any more information (or confirmation) on this.  However the evidence seems to corroborate his information: the error only occurs when linking from an HTTPS site to an HTTP site.\nStackExchange is hosted securely, so linking to the secure site works:\nhttps://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd\nWhile the non-secure does not:\nhttp://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd\nI have also reported this via the Apple Bug Reporter tool.  My first report has mysteriously disappeared.  I have re-logged, but have also heard many accounts of bug reports never being responded to.  If anyone here has a reliable reference that this is an intentional change, that would be great.  Otherwise I still consider it a bug.\n\nA: Well since I can't find a definitive public answer, I'll do the next best thing.  This is the response I got on a private bug report through Apple:\n\nThis behavior is expected. Following the fix per another bug. We do not prompt for credentials whenever navigating to an insecure web page that requires authentication from a secure web page. Moreover, we do not prompt for credentials when loading an insecure subresource (say, an image) that requires authentication or a secure subresource that requires authentication through an insecure redirect on a secure web page. The motivation for these restrictions is to prevent phishing attacks by a networking attacker who could have replaced the contents of the insecure resource HTTP response with a secure redirect to their own server that prompts for credentials. Although the authentication prompt shows the URL being accessed, a person may not read the prompt closely or, more likely, an attacker can purchase a domain name that could lull a person into falsely believing that the URL is legitimate so that the person submits their credentials to the attacker.\n\nI'm still looking for a public statement from Apple that can be linked to.  If someone can provide that I will mark that as the accepted answer.\nUPDATE\nSomeone with authority at Apple got in touch with me about this.  They finally linked me to the official release document showing the changed behaviour: \n\nChanged to only allow non-mixed content protected sub-resources to ask for credentials.\nhttps://webkit.org/blog/8035/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-44/\nhttps://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/#r44\n\nWe worked with Apple to address the broken user experience caused by this security fix. Apple listened to our feedback and fixed the credentials dialog for links from an HTTPS resource to an HTTP hosted resource. It works correctly now in Safari on Mojave onwards.\n\nA: I would also like to remind non regular MacOS users that Basic Authentication can be stored in keychain so it may not be obvious when you are automatically logged in.\n", "Q: Unable to access files with File Sharing in Mac OS High Sierra Has anybody know how can we share folder/files from High Sierra?\nI can not access files when I followed usual process of going to \"System Preferences > File Sharing > Enable AFP and adding users with required privileges”\nBut, when I do same for Mac having previous OS version (e.g. Sierra) File Sharing works.\nAnyone any clues what am I missing?\n\nA: Gordan's got the issue: \nTo connect to an APFS formatted volume you need to turn OFF sharing via AFP (forcing SMB connection) on the macOS devices you are trying to share. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences (Screen Menu > Apple icon > System Preferences\n\n*Select Sharing icon (3rd row, Folder w/ caution sign)\n\n*Select File Sharing in Right hand list (check to turn on if not already)\n\n*Select Options ... botton on right\n\n*UNCHECK Share files and Folder using AFP\n\n*Repeat as needed for Mac devices you're trying to share\nThen you should be able to connect and log in to the Mac shared on you network as before.\nSee Apples (very) brief doc Prepare for APFS in macOS High Sierra for other items affected by the change to APFS.\n", "Q: Possible to transfer an active, Verizon sim card to an unlocked iPhone 8 purchased from the Apple store? I would like to purchase an iPhone 8 as a gift for a current Verizon customer who is still using an old iPhone 5c. I plan to purchase the phone outright and since the cost at the Verizon store is the same as with Apple, I would prefer to get it directly from Apple. My question is, can I buy her a SIM free phone from Apple or must I buy a Verizon activated phone from Apple instead? This person has a current, activated Verizon account with a Verizon iPhone 5c phone (which was paid off in monthly installments a long time ago). My guess is that since she already has a Verizon account with the 5c and an active SIM card, I could just go with the SIM free option and then all she would need to do is transfer her Verizon SIM card to the new phone and it will work fine. Is this a correct assumption?\nThank you!\n\nA: In theory, that would be fine.\nWhen you buy a phone from Apple it will be unlocked for use with any network so they can just put their network sim into it and be good to go.\nThey both use nano sims so the sim will be good to swap straight away.\nThe only issue is that Verizon have been using(and AFAIK are still using) a different model of iPhone to the rest of the US networks.\nIf you're buying it from an actual Apple Store you could ask them just to make sure 100%. As I'm not from the US, I'm not 100% sure what the deal is with CDMA/GSM models as they are all GSM in Europe.\nAssuming Verizon still uses CDMA, you would need to make sure that the iPhone is a CDMA version.\nMore info\n", "Q: upgrade to macOS high sierra, bootcamp win10 disk exists but can not prompt when turn on the power I just upgrade my mac mini to macOS high sierra.\nBefore, when I turn on the power, there is the option for me to choose boot from Windows 10 or macOS.\nbut right now, it boots and enters macOS directly.\nI checked and found that BOOTCAMP disk still exist,\nall content of the bootcamp hard disk appeared and nothing removed.\nIs there any way to activate/import the existed bootcamp disk and add the option for Windows 10/macOS when turn on the power?\n\nA: If you just want the option when needed, hold the alt/opt key doing boot, it’ll let you choose which OS you want to boot...\n\nA: The software provided by Apple does not include an option to choose whether to boot Windows 10 or macOS at startup.

That feature will let the Mac do some things in the background while sleeping. Things that use little actual battery power. That is shows 100% CPU usage is odd, so I am not certain this is Power Nap.\n\nA: I'm looking at the graph, and \"Power nap\" is involved, but not the issue itself. Wakes are clearly visible from 03:00-06:00, but something heavy started around 10:35 and prevented the mac from entering sleep mode. Subsequent wakes are visible. It could be time machine backup (unlikely) or crashed/playing on background browser or other process.\nFrom this screenshot it's unclear, but when this happens, you could use Activity Monitor -> Energy to see what consumes most energy and does it prevent sleep.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro won't start after restart (red charger icon) So I just installed Flash and restarted my Mac, and now it won't start.

I will generally be working on the monitor and using the Macbook display for reference material and chat. When I am working, with focus on the monitor, I will open mission control and click on a different space on the Macbook screen to look something up. However, the initial click to switch spaces does not switch focus to the Macbook screen, so when I start typing I end up doing random things in the full screen app on my monitor. \nIs it possible to change this behavior so that clicking on a different space on the non-focused monitor also switches focus to that monitor? Is this the expected behavior?\n\nA: I've been trying to solve a similar issue, Mac mini with 2 external monitors.

This allows you to sort items by clicking on the headers (e.g. clicking on the Name header will choose between an ascending or descending sort).\nIf you're wanting to manually sort items regardless of the view you're using, you can use the Arrange button in the Finder's Toolbar. This looks like:\n\nBy clicking on this you can arrange your items by any of the following options:\n\nPerhaps an option that will interest you is the fact you can customise your Finder's Toolbar.

Many guides on the net with a simple google: Example Bash 4 upgrade guide for Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash 4.x (installed via brew) location: /usr/local/bin/bash\n\n*Bash 3.2 (Default OSX) location: /bin/bash\nProblem\nScripts I can not control/modify the shebang, as it would affect other users. Unless I was to manually change and then revert before committing to source control. Another option is to type: bash some_script_with_bin_bash_shebang.shto force the use of the newly defaulted bash 4 shell. \nI only ever need to do this for Bash 4+ functionality, which is very common now.    \nQuestion\nDoes anyone have a cool technique, workarounds to alias a shebang bash path like so: #!/bin/bash to the newer bash 4 shell at /usr/local/bin/bash? \nWithout obviously modifying the file! ^_^ (e.g. adding #!/usr/bin/env bash)\n\nA: This is the main reason nowadays for using a different shebang:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is #!/usr/bin/env bash superior to #!/bin/bash? - Stack Overflow\nThis will use the first bash in the PATH, which will most likely be the latest version. Since /bin is in the standard path (getconf PATH), this falls back gracefully for those without a custom bash.\n\nA: Firstly, you could consider simply replacing /bin/bash with a more uptodate version.\nSecondly, if you're not comfortable voiding your warranty doing that, and where you already have a problem with an existing script, bypass its #! line by invoking it as:\n/path/to/bash4/path/to/script.bashargs...\n(You can just use bash rather than its full path if your $PATH is in the right order.)\nThirdly, if this script is specific to Apple devices and must have Bash version 4, then always set it explicitly to #!/path/to/bash4, as there's no benefit to setting it to anything else. (This does not mean changing it in your source repo, but rather choosing it at installation time; see below.)\nFourthly, consider using https://gist.github.com/kurahaupo/8130030 - note that you need the \"source\" version of the script to be outside the intended bin directory; eg, leave it in your source repo, or in a temporary directory (which can be deleted after this \"installation\").\nFifthly, if you really don't want to touch the original script, make a stub script that invokes it:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec /path/to/bash4 /path/where/you/stashed/the/original/script \"$@\"\n\nand install that in a suitable bin directory.\nSource vs Deploy\nYour query about setting the #! line in the source repo highlights an extremely prevalent misapprehension about scripts: the idea that a script, simply because it is \"text\", should not need to be \"prepared for use\" in any sense.\nFor other types of programs it's obvious: they have to be compiled. And if they're large python or perl scripts, they need a package or installer that will include any module dependencies.\nBut even a shell script needs, at minimum, to have its ownership and permissions set, and to be placed into a bin directory. Typically this would be either when a package is built for a class of device, or when the script is installed on a target device. This is also the appropriate time to set the #! line to match the deployment environment.\nI do not recommend #!/usr/bin/env bash\nThe widespread promotion of #!/usr/bin/env slightly weakens overall security, but in a way that's not likely to bite the people who write it, only the users somewhere down the track. Therefore I do not recommend it; indeed I predict that eventually it's going to come back and bite your clients, or your clients' clients, or your clients' clients' ... clients.\nIt's promoted as \"portable\", but that's not actually true: Android and OpenWRT devices do not even have /usr much less /usr/bin/env, so it's quite useless there. So in practice the main beneficiaries are Apple users.\nIf the script requires a new version of bash, then the system version simply won't do, so it's pointless using it as a fallback. But if you don't need the latest version, then having it fixed as /bin/bash is fine.\nIn short, if you're deploying a script to Apple that requires Bash version 4, then you should use #!/path/to/bash4, either when you build the script into an installable package, or when the script is installed on a particular device.\nEDIT\nI replaced /usr/local/bin/bash with /path/to/bash4 because that was causing some confusion. The point isn't that /usr/local/bin/bash must be used, but rather that the full path to bash4, whatever it is, should be specified explicitly. If you don't know it before installation, looking in $PATH then is a reasonable thing to do, but you'd want to run a short test like\nbash_path=$( type -p bash )\nif ! \"$bash_path\" -c '[[ $BASH_VERSION > 4.2 ]]'\nthen\n    echo \"ERROR: $bash_path isn't new enough\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n{\n  printf '#!%s\\n' \"$bash_path\"\n  tail -n+2 \"$downloaded_file\"\n} > \"$installpath\"\nchmod a=rx \"$installpath\"\n\n\nA: My workaround is simply to call the interpreter directly.\nSo for example, instead of calling something like:\n./foo.sh\nI instead call it with:\nbash ./foo.sh\nThe first form (calling './foo.sh') exercises the interpreter defined in the shebang line, giving you (unwanted) bash 3.x on OSX (at least as of OSX Big Sur).  However, the second form ignores the shebang line, calling the version of bash you have in your PATH. If your PATH has '/usr/local/bin' (or wherever you install with brew) occurring before '/bin', you'll execute your script with the desired bash version regardless of what's on the shebang line. Thus, you can run your script with goodies needing bash 4.x+ (like associative arrays).\nThis achieves the goals of not having to change the script at all, while still executing with the version of bash you want. As of this writing you can get bash 5.x with brew, whereas OSX 11.2 \"Big Sur\" still ships with /bin/bash being v3.x.\nThis methodology fits best when you develop for platforms where '/bin/bash' is reliably a version you want, but you develop on OSX where '/bin/bash' is 3.x. That way you can develop and test with the intended target version of bash without modifying the script's shebang line in ways that make it less reliable on target platforms. For bash in particular, I also prefer not using the #!/usr/bin/env trick, as that added complexity for users to deal with and can add complexity to supporting it.\nI understand the point raised about Source vs. Deployment, and that there is no absolute requirement not to allow deployment changes to shell scripts. However, being \"allowed\" to change the shebang lines in version control and having that cause required changes in deployment processes can be a big deal, and might not be something you have any control over. Having shell scripts that require a deployment process that modifies the checksum of the original code reduces one of the core \"simplicity\" advantages of using bash shell scripts. If scripts are deployed as part of some larger product with ability to ensure complex installation steps are handled reliably, then I wouldn't object to it. But if scripts are the product, there's much benefit in limiting deployment complexity to \"untar from a tarball\" (with a prescribed command that handles the chmod +x and placement/deployment location).\n", "Q: macOS Sierra 10.12.6 can't connect to VPN using IKEv2.

I'm not sure why I can't seem to find a simple answer to this question online, but here's what I'm trying to accomplish. I have 9.5GB of photos and videos on my iPhone that I want to back up to cloud storage. I am interested in using iCloud Storage for the simple fact that I am already paying for extra storage for my iPhone backup. But none of the options available (iCloud Photo Library, Photo Stream, iCloud Photo Sharing) fit what I want to do.\nAll I want to do is upload image files as backup files to iCloud Storage. I don't care if they are synced with my Apple devices or not, though I do not want edits/deletions on those devices to remove that same file from iCloud.

Please use a ISO file for 64-bit Windows installation. \nMy ultimate goal is to make the USB bootable with a new Windows 7 install from within my mac, and then booting my old Windows Vista computer with the fresh install.  \nHow might I get this to work? \n\nA: Basically, you can use your Mac to create a USB flash drive installer for use on a PC. The steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Virtual Box. This is free software.\n\n*Install Virtual Box Extension Pack. This will give virtual machines access to the USB ports.\n\n*Create a Windows virtual machine. Do not activate.\n\n*Download the flash drive creation tool. This download website is very slow. Be patient.\n\n*Put the Windows iso file and the flash drive creation tool on the flash drive.\n\n*Copy the iso and creation tool from the flash drive to the Windows virtual machine main drive.\n\n*Use the creation tool to transfer the iso to the flash drive.\nIf you need a better explanation of any step, let me know.\nAdvice on VirtualBox and Flash Drives\nTry these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the image of a USB flash drive on the bottom of the virtual machine window. Note the devices.\n\n*Insert the flash drive in a USB port.\n\n*Repeat step 1. The flash drive is the new item in the list. Usually something cryptic. The item may be grayed out.\n\n*If the item is grayed out, then you must unmount the flash drive. You can do this from the Disk Utility application, but sometimes this fails to work. If you use the Terminal application, you can enter the command diskutil list before and after inserting the flash drive in the USB port. The added disk is the one that must be unmounted. Here, I will assume this is disk1. The command to unmount the flash drive would then be as shown below.\ndiskutil  unmountdisk  disk1\n\n\nNote:  Sometimes you have to wait a few seconds before the status of a flash drive changes. For example, you can unmount a flash drive, but the item may remain grayed out in the VirtualBox list for several seconds.\n\n\n*Click on the image of a USB flash drive on the bottom of the virtual machine window. Select the flash drive. If it is still grayed out, then you must repeat step 4.\n\nNote: I would not mess with the VM \"Ports\" settings or USB device filters In fact, I have never figured out what the device filters are for.\n\n", "Q: Why does the file creation date remain the same when copying and pasting a file? When copying a file from flash drive to macOS file system, the file creation date remains the same as the original file.\nIf it is on Windows, the file creation date of a new file when copying a file and pasting it will not be same as the original file, but will have the current date time instead.\nWhy is the behavior different between OS? Is this due to the different specification in NTFS and HFS file system?\n\nA: I just found the answer in this Mac Help post by Gregory Pratt:\n\nThe Windows philosophy toward creation times is filesystem-centric;\n  the timestamp reflects the time when the file entry was created on\n  that volume. For this reason, when you copy the file to a different\n  volume, the copy gets a new creation timestamp -- one that might even\n  be newer than the file modification time.\nThe Mac philosophy toward creation times is document-oriented; the\n  timestamp indicates when the document (the contents of the file) was\n  first saved.\n\n\nA: This is because the GUI copy function on macOS preserves all attributes by default.\nTo put it in command line terms:\nWhen you copy and paste a file in macOS, by default its doing this:\ncp -a /source/file1 /destination/\n\nwhich preserves attributes such as permissions and timestamps.\nThe only workaround for this (i.e., to achieve Windows-like behavior) is to copy files using the command line. Applications -> Terminal.app\nand use the following command:\ncp -r /source/file1 /destination\n\nAlternatively, you can simplify the process by allowing terminal to get file paths by simply dragging and dropping the source file and the destination folder:\n\n*\n\n*Search\n\n*Type \"Terminal\". Press return\n\n*Type cp -r \n\n*Drag and drop the source file\n\n*Drag and drop the destination file\n\n*Press return again.\n\n", "Q: How do I migrate my wife's iCloud from her paid storage to our family storage?

Specifically how do I do this in such as way as the 10GB already in her iCloud storage is not nuked.\n\nA: @RDG : That link does not explain how to merge an already existing plan into a family plan that the user has been added to. It merely states that you can:\n\nIf a family member is already paying for their own iCloud storage\n  plan, they can choose to switch to your plan or keep their own and\n  still remain part of the family. When they switch to the shared family\n  plan, they get a refund for the remainder of their personal plan. They\n  can't keep their current plan and use the shared family plan at the\n  same time.\n\n@Dave Sag: I had the same problem with my family—my son already had a 50G storage plan and after I got a 200G family storage plan and added all my family members to it, for some reason it still showed him as \"not using\", and nowhere in the iCloud preferences on him MacBook would it allow him to switch to the family plan and get rid of his individual plan.\nAfter a lot of digging I found one article that mentioned that in order to use the family shared iCloud storage you have to be running Mac OS High Sierra (10.13) or higher. Turned out, he was still on Sierra (10.12). After upgrading his MacBook to High Sierra the iCloud preferences now showed a button to \"Use Family Storage\". Clicking that instantly moved all his iCloud data from his individual storage plan to the family shared storage.\nAfter doing that, it no longer even shows his 50G plan in the iCloud preferences. I'm assuming that it has cancelled that plan. If I find out that it did not automatically cancel that plan and that I have to go cancel it myself, I'll follow up on here to let you know.\nCheers\n—Dan\n\nA: *\n\n*Either call Apple or through App Store login cancel your 50 GB subscription to downgrade to 5 GB basic free pack even if your data is more than 5 GB.

If you are added first and then downgrade it shall fail and fail repeatedly.\n\n*Now get added to Family Sharing using the family head by going to Settings on the family head’s iPhone and adding the family member.\nWhen you are added you will automatically become part of the plan and start sharing common iCloud space.\n\n\nOnly members on 5 GB plan get automatically migrated when added to family head. Anyone with 50 GB or more paid plan shall not. That is why he has to be downgraded to 5 GB first (don't worry, your data is safe for 30 days any way) to be eligible to be added.\nThe sequence is important: first downgrade then add to family otherwise you'll go around in circles for ever.

Can I solve this problem without a clean installation of the OS?\nThanks very much and have a nice day!\n\n\nA: That is not a software issue. Your graphics card is getting inappropriate power. You probably have a capacitor or transistor that is dying (if you're lucky; if you're REALLY lucky you might be able to pinpoint the exact component by visual inspection) or the graphics chip is nearing the end of its lifespan.\nIf there is a shop that does board-level repairs near where you live it might be repairable, usually using donor parts from other dead boards.\nMost often, instead of just dying one day, the glitches might slowly degrade to something like this.\nI think on the 2011 iMacs the dGPU was a mezzanine card? I don't know if you would feel it is worth it to repair, maybe you could find a replacement for cheap.\nIf this is the integrated graphics, I don't think there is anything that can be done.\nAs for the MacBook, that's a completely different machine in terms of architecture, and not just for the GPU. Probably unrelated, but you could provide more details on what the issues on that machine are like in another question.\n", "Q: How to make my `/usr` folder secure? I'm trying to install the Tunnelblick open source VPN client on my Mac running OS X 10.10.5. \nWhen I try to install the dmg I get the following error (see attached screenshot). \n\nHow would I make my /usr folder secure? The account I use by default is my main user account, but also the admin account for the computer. Would it be a question of making a my main user account a standard user and setting up a separate admin account? \n\nA: It seems the permissions on /usr are incorrect, which in the past has been attributed to installing MacPorts. You can repair the permissions on /usr by running:\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr\nsudo chmod 0755 /usr\n\nSince MacPorts installs to /opt/local, this shouldn't affect MacPorts, but as I don't use MacPorts I can't say for certain.\n", "Q: Slow/laggy rMBP (mid 2014) - nVidia card not being used? I have a mid 2014 MBPr & it is very sluggish (2-3 second response times moving between applications/slow chrome rendering) to the point that i did a full re-install of OS (High Sierra) at the weekend to see if this would speed up the laptop.

Is there a way to 'switch on' the nVidia card to be used?\n \n\n\nThe spec of the machine is; \n\n--Edit -- Memory footprint\n\n\nA: You could try installing the NVIDIA Web Driver for your GPU. That's what I did to try and improve GPU performance on my old MBP with GeForce 320M. It also adds a preference pane where you can always switch back to using Apple's default GPU driver.\nSince the NVIDIA driver archive is a pain to navigate I recommend using the NVIDIA Web Driver Auto Installer from here to automatically find and install the correct driver for your GPU.\n\nA: In short, I solved the problem by rolling back to Sierra as the discrete graphic card isn't compatible with High Sierra.\nI've been using Sierra for 2 days now & its like i've a new macbook as its so fast - No lag or freezing issues and everything just works \nFurther information; https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8204377\n", "Q: iTerm not showing colors for directories/folders I have tried solutions in various places (including here but there are still no color in my iTerm.\nI have these lines in my .bash_profile:\nexport CLICOLOR=1\nexport LSCOLORS=cxfxdxdxhxegedabagacad\n\nAnd if I do ls, it gives me everything in the same color:\n\nany help?

In order to just start the laptop from scratch again so I could make a new Apple ID, I reset the laptop. \nBy doing so I had to delete the system drive, then re download it as macOS Sierra, which took around 10 hours to download, and then it said download failed. I tried again and it didn't work. I then pressed \"help\" or whatever it was, the Safari icon, but after I closed it I was left on a blank grey screen, nothing I could do or press. I pressed the power button to turn it off, the only option I had, and when I turn it back on, a no entry sign appears.\n\nA: With the machine off, hold alt-cmd-R as you turn the computer on to launch Internet Recovery.

I recently updated my my Mac from a Macbook Pro 2013 Retina to a Macbook Pro 2017. In the process, I moved from Sierra to High Sierra OS.\nThe most annoying thing about this transition has been the loss of a quick navigation to the applications folder. I used to be able to bring it up with Cmd + space for spotlight, and type \"App\" and the Applications folder was the first result.\nNow, it's a crap shoot if the folder will be in the results for \"App\" at all. To get it to reliably be the top result, I have to type all the way out to \"Application\" or even \"Applications\". (The horror!)\nHow can I change this behavior to have what I want at the top of the list? Is there a specific setting change I can make to Spotlight? Or is it just a matter of patient retraining?\nI saw this question Spotlight search results priority from 2015 and OS X 10.9 that suggests modifying the filters and also states that there are no options provided for changing the priority. Is that still the case?\n\nA: I ran into the same problem.  What worked for me was to use command-space to begin the spotlight search, type in the characters to search for, then clicking on the app I want to be the first in the list.  For example, if I type just a \"t\", the textEdit app was the first choice, but I wanted the terminal app to be first.

I have a number of old 3.5\" floppies (Amiga and PC format) that I'd like to archive before they disintegrate. I'm curious if a cheap USB 3.5\" floppy drive will work on OSX / macOS 10.11+?\nYes, I understand that reading an Amiga disk might be stretching things a bit, but was hoping perhaps a dd command might work. Otherwise, I'm thinking perhaps these devices only know how to read PC format and act as mass storage (ha!) devices..\n\nA: The short answer is yes, external USB floppy drives will still work with macOS. \nHowever, the issues you're likely to face relate to:\n\n\n*\n\n*how the actual floppy disks are formatted (both in terms of file systems and capacity)\n\n*the type of floppy disks involved (i.e. are we talking 1.4MB disks, or older 800KB or even 400KB floppies)\n\n*the condition of the floppy disks (specifically, are they now demagnetised?)\n\n\nAssuming they're 1.4MB floppies then you should be able to read the data. You won't, however, be able to write data to the floppies (although in your case this shouldn't be an issue as you're wanting to copy the data from them, not to them).\nIf they're 400KB or 800KB floppies, you can pretty much forget about using Mac OS X / macOS.\nIf they're demagnetised, you can pretty much forget about using anything to read the data.\n", "Q: Upgrade HDD to SSD in High Sierra and import a Time Machine backup I am thinking to put an external Time Machine backup (HFS+ files) from my old HDD on a newly installed SSD in my MacBook Pro mid 2012. Is this possible?  Will the SSD recognise and accept this backup? Or is it possible or advisable to install the new SSD with the old HFS+ system instead of the new APFS. All in High Sierra. How to go about? \n\nA: There's 2 ways to do this, I prefer the first since it ensures you start with a macOS install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the blank SSD in your Mac.\n\n*Boot while holding ⌥⌘R for Internet Recovery.\n\n*Follow the steps to download and install macOS on your SSD.\n\n*During Setup Assistant, when prompted if you'd like to transfer your files, choose to transfer from a Time Machine backup.\n\n*Follow the steps to important your content and settings from your Time Machine disk.\n\n\nAlternatively you can use the Time Machine backup for the initial macOS install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the blank SSD in your Mac.\n\n*Connect your Time Machine backup disk.\n\n*Boot while holding ⌥ and choose your Time Machine disk from Startup Manager.\n\n*Follow the steps to install macOS on your SSD using the Time Machine disk.\n\n\nA: You cannot just copy the Time Machine backup onto an SSD and expect to boot your Mac to the point of the last backup.\nYou must first install MacOS on the SSD, then install the SSD into the MacBook Pro. Finally restore from the TimeMachine backup (you will be give this choice when you first boot from the OS on the new SSD).\nThe trick is how to install MacOS on the SSD to begin with.\nMy solution was to get an external USB to SATA adapter, then boot from the existing disk into recovery mode and perform a new OS installation on the external disk. You may first need to format the external SSD using Disk Utility which you can do when you boot in Recovery mode.\nOnce the the new OS is on the external SSD replace your internal disk with it, and boot up. During initial configuration it will ask you if you want to restore from a Time Machine backup.\n", "Q: Using Rsync For Exact Copy I've used rsync before, on Linux, many times, but also many years ago and I also don't know if there are any differences or issues between using it on an iMac and on Linux.\nI have a drive with a problem and now mounts read-only.  I replaced it with a good new drive and it's now connected via USB in a SATA case.\nIf I want to create a folder on the new drive, say, \"/OldDrive\", and copy all the files on my old drive over to it, preserving ownerships, permissions, and anything else macOS cares about, what are the command options and switches I need to use on rsync to do this?\n\nA: Rsync isn't the best choice for Mac to Mac copies.\nI'd use ditto or asr if you need a command line solution. Disk Utility calls asr internally and you could mirror the volume and then wipe and run Migration Assistant - that's far better than trying to boot from a damaged copy.\nDo go ahead and make the full copy for your backup - then consider installing to a new OS.\nIn fact, you could install OS onto an external USB / Thunderbolt / FireWire drive first before even making a copy then migrate the data and accounts and apps from the internal drive to the external clean OS install.\nThat saves a step and you don't even need to worry about syntax of asr or ditto or rsync\n\nA: You can use dd to create a bit for bit duplicate. \ndd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY conv=noerror,sync\n\nTo find the name of your disks:\ndiskutil list\n\nThen unmount the destination drive\ndiskutil unmount volume\n\nThen run dd.

Here's how I'm getting the value of the current week number and assigning the previous week's number.\nWEEKNBR=$(date +\"%V\")\nPREVWK=$((WEEKNBR-1))\n\nThe value of WEEKNBR is in a two digit form eg. \"Week05\" but the PREVWK would be \"WEEK4\".\nHow would  go about subtracting 1 from WEEKNBR and have the result be preceded by 0 when applicable?\n\nA: You can use date to do the arithmetic for you. With BSD date:\n$ /bin/date +%V\n03\n$ /bin/date -v-1w +%V\n02\n\nFrom man date:\n-v   Adjust (i.e., take the current date and display the result of the\n     adjustment; not actually set the date) the second, minute, hour,\n     month day, week day, month or year according to val.  If val is\n     preceded with a plus or minus sign, the date is adjusted forwards\n     or backwards according to the remaining string, otherwise the\n     relevant part of the date is set.  The date can be adjusted as\n     many times as required using these flags.  Flags are processed in\n     the order given.\n\nIn case you have installed and are using GNU date:\n$ date -d '-1week' +%V\n02\n$ date -d '-1 week' +%V\n02\n$ date -d 'now - 1 week' +%V\n02\n$ date -d 'last week' +%V\n02\n\n\nA: A \"one-liner\" (OK, two-liner) is\nWEEKNBR=$(date +\"%V\")\nPREVWK=$(printf %02d $((WEEKNBR-1)))\n\n\nA: I think what you are after here is a way to check if $PREVWK is 2 digits long or not, in which case you respectively either prepend a 0 to the beginning of the existing number or not.  \nImplementation:\nWEEKNBR=$(date +\"%V\")\nPREVWK=$((WEEKNBR-1))\n\nif [[ $(echo -n ${PREVWK} | wc -c) -lt 2 ]] ; then\n    PREVWK=\"0${PREVWK}\"\nfi\n\nIt looks at the number of digits in the variable (be sure it is always a number) and decides if it is made up of less than 2 digits. If so, it prepends 0, else it leaves the number alone. This way, weeks like 23 will stay as 23 instead of 023, and so on.\nLet me know if that works for you or if you are looking for another/different way to achieve it. You could also check if the number as a whole is less than 10, meaning a leading 0 needs to be added.\n\nA: A one liner approach that won't break when the new year rolls around and that always gives the correct week number for seven days before the current moment:\nweeknbr=\"$(date +%V)\"\nprevwk=\"$(date -j -v -7d +%V)\"\n\nNote that I'm using lower case names because these are not (or should not be) environment variables; see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there naming conventions for variables in shell scripts?\n\nP.S.: I see that muru has written an essentially identical answer, but I had this tab open for some hours before getting back to it and neglected to refresh.\n", "Q: Is it possible to sync custom fonts between macOS and iOS devices? I am curious as to whether it is possible to synchronise custom/downloaded fonts from macOS High Sierra to an iPhone?\nFrom what I understand, if both devices meet the requirements for Continuity they are capable of implementing the Handoff feature. This means a document (containing the custom font) started on the mac will show the same custom font on the iPhone, correct?\nIs it possible then, to reverse the logic such that custom fonts are always synced between both devices, without employing the use of the Handoff feature - making the fonts available in other iOS applications?\nThe Handoff feature is just an example of what looks like font synchronisation but what I am really interested in is a way to copy/sync a font from the macOS device to the iOS device if it does not exist there (e.g. downloaded fonts). Making it available on a system-wide level (not per application) to each application capable of creating/displaying rich text.\nI am interested in this from a security point of view to learn whether file types like fonts can be just as easily synced as Contacts and similar cloud-based content.\n\nA: No, you're not exactly correct. \nMost app developers will make sure that both the macOS and iOS versions of their program display the custom font. This is done using either font embedding (i.e. the font is stored inside the document), or using streaming, which is a Handoff-feature that allows for the source program to transfer larger quantities of data to the destination program.\nSome app developers have not invested the time necessary to do this, or are constrained in other ways. In those cases the document will show up with a wrong font on the destination device.\nAs such, there's no automatic, iOS/macOS handled synchronization of fonts taking place during Handoff.\nIn general, you can add fonts to the system font library using configuration profiles. This is intended for enterprise usage where iOS devices that are supervised or where it is otherwise accepted to install configuration profiles. This way they can have for example the company's own font installed. In the case of iOS devices managed by for example an MDM system, you could say that it is possible to \"synchronise\" fonts from a Mac. \nThese fonts are available to use in apps that support choosing from the system library. Not all apps do this! - However apps like Pages and Numbers do support it.\nTo create a correct configuration profile with a font payload, you'll need a code signing certificate - otherwise the user will get a lot of warnings when installing the configuration profile. The user must install the configuration themselves by agreeing to the installation in System Preferences (you can send them there by the way of a link or similar).\nFor home users the easiest way to install a font is probably using a third party app such as AnyFont! or similar. \nIf you're interested in specifically whether an ordinary user can select somewhere that all the fonts on their Mac must be available on their iOS device - then no, no such synchronisation method is available on standard iOS.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of ⌘+Fn+← (Command-Function-Left) in Safari? I think I've found the most secret and disappointing easter egg on Mac.\n⌘Fn← (Command Function Left) in Safari goes to Apple.com; does anyone know why, or when, this was added? Cmd-Fn-Up and down and right don't do anything.\nI couldn't find anything on this after about 10 seconds of skim-reading on google search.\nBTW I was trying to do ⇧⌘← (Shift Command Left) which selects everything to the left of the cursor.\nAlso noticed ⌃⌘← (Control Command Left) does some weird right-align thing.\n\nA: Apparently it is a shortcut to go to your homepage and not an easter egg and does not necessarily open https://www.apple.com but I haven't changed my homepage so in my case it does.\n", "Q: About this MAC/Storage showing incorrect SYSTEM size I have a 250GB SDD, and AboutThisMAC is showing 191GB available, but ALSO showing the SYSTEM taking up 159GB.  I've scoured the forums and cannot find an answer to this strange occurrence.\nI already rebuilt the Spotlight cache (add HDD to privacy, reboot, remove HDD from privacy, reboot)\nI also check the TimeMachine, but since I haven't used it, it had no backups\nHelp?! (and thank you)\n\n\nA: It seems illogical but it is really not. The important distinction to note is that the screenshot does not say \"192.29 GB free\", rather it says \"192.29 GB available\".\nThis is because the system part (shown as 159.77 GB) includes disk caches. Most of these disk caches are purgeable, meaning that they can be automatically freed up when space is needed.\nSo you have 191.29 GB available for you to use when you want - but while you're not using them, the system is using them to speed up operations using caching.\n\nA: Figured out the issue in my case. \nSteps:\ncd /\nIf you see a folder called 'cores', \ntype cd cores\nIf not, you can ignore the rest of this post.\ntype ls\nIf there's anything in here then it's probably the cause or a significant contributor to your issue..\ntype sudo chmod -R 777 ./\nEnter your password\ntype rm -rf ./ \nAnd yeah this is relatively safe to do.

BACKGROUND\nMany years ago when I first got an iPod I created an AppleID, which my wife and I shared for AppStore purchases.\nWhen Apple changed the system, we created new AppleID to use for iCloud synchronisation for Contacts etc.\nWe continued to use the original AppleID for purchases, which were all done through iTunes.\nNow that iTunes no longer works for purchases I have been updating apps on line.\nI wanted to install a new (free) app on my iPhone. This prompted for the password for my new AppleID, which I entered.\nI now seem to have one app on my new AppleID, and all the others on the original AppleID.\n\nHow can I configure my devices to use the new AppleID for Contacts, Calendar etc, but use the original AppleID for purchases?\n\nLogging off the new then logging on the new seems to take forever, and wants to overwrite all my data.\nPS The original AppleID has Family Sharing setup.\nThe iPhone is running iOS 10.3.2\nWhen I go to Settings this shows  \niCloud: new AppleID\nStore: original AppleID\n\nbelow this it shows  \niCloud: new AppleID\niTunes & App Store: original AppleID\nFamily Sharing: my name & my wife's name\n\nI see no \"person\" icon on the top right, and when I click on Updates this prompts me for the password for my new AppleID\n\"Purchases\" in the App Store shows\nMy Purchases\n\nFamily Purchases\nmy wife's name\nmy name\n\nThe apps in My Purchases and Family Purchases my name seem the same!\n\nA: On the iPhone, open the App Store. Click the \"person\" icon on the top right. This will allow you to log out from your new Apple ID, and then login with your old Apple ID.\nThis will not overwrite any date, nor will it change which Apple ID is used for contacts, calendar, iCloud or anything like that. It will only change which Apple ID is used for purchases on the App Store (including downloading of free apps).\n", "Q: Pages- IPHONE apps I’ve actually locked some of my important information in a documents in Pages.

Some change behavior of features, others are for debugging or experimenting. This page lists the available switches including their conditions and descriptions.\n\n\nAnother approach would be to use AppleScript from the command line, e.g:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Google Chrome\" to set URL of active tab of (make new window) to \"https://www.etymonline.com/\"'\n\nFor ease of use, you could wrap this in a function and place it in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile file, e.g:\nopenurl () \n{ \n    if [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n        osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Google Chrome\\\" to set URL of active tab of (make new window) to  \\\"$1\\\"\"\n    else\n        printf \"\\n  Missing URL...\\n\\n    Syntax: openurl 'URL'\\n\\n    Example: openurl 'http://www.google.com'\\n\\n\"\n    fi\n}\n\nThen in Terminal, simply use the following, e.g.:\nopenurl 'https://www.etymonline.com/'\n\nIf you execute openurl without an argument, you get the following output:\n$ openurl\n\n  Missing URL...\n\n    Syntax: openurl 'URL'\n\n    Example: openurl 'http://www.google.com'\n\n$\n\nNote: The URL is shown wrapped in single quotes and this to ensure no expansion takes place when the URL is passed to the function if it has any shell special characters in it. The single quotes can be omitted for basic/simple URLs.\nThis same approach can be applied to the open command as well. That said, the reason I'd choose to wrap the AppleScript in a function is at some point the open command used in this manner with Google Chrome may break. This is because when Google Chrome is already open, it's opening a second instance, which is then passed to the first instance and the second instance terminated. This behavior may become problematic as Goggle Chrome is updated, where the AppleScript in a function will not, as it's only talking to the first instance of Google Chrome.\n\nA: The above answers work from the command line, but if you want Chrome to open things in a new window everywhere by default (and not just from the command-line) you have to change the http/https file handlers to a script that does what you want. \nWith a default handler set to open a new window, it will work from the command line or when you click a link in Mail or similar, and thus integrate much more nicely with Spaces since you'll get a new window on the current space with your desired link, instead of a new tab in some other Space that you have to hunt for.\nSpecifically you need a script like this:\non open location theURL\n    tell application \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\"\n        make new window\n        activate\n        set URL of active tab of first window to theURL\n    end tell\nend open location\n\nThen you save that from ScriptEditor as an app, run it to register it with LaunchServices, and edit the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist file to have your app as the default for http/https.\nYou can find an integrated solution with the script as an app and (in a current comment) a PList editing script to tell the system to use your app here:\nhttps://smoove-operator.blogspot.com/2011/06/open-links-from-external-applications.html\nInspiration from http://pepijndevos.nl/2010/05/open-external-links-in-running-browser/ and https://github.com/primalcurve/macsupportpub/blob/master/scripts/setGoogleChromeAsDefaultBrowser_Scrubbed.sh\n", "Q: Numbers if cell is equal to X or Y Is it possible to test a cell using IF against multiple strings?

I can only come up with this in cell A2:\nIF(A1 = \"Apple\"|\"Orange\", \"Fruit\", \"Not a fruit\")\n\nThis results in an error.\n\nA: This is thankfully quite easy. You can achieve what you want using the OR function in Numbers (this function is also found on Microsoft Excel):\nIF(OR(A1 = \"Apple\", A1 = \"Orange\"), \"Fruit\", \"Not a fruit\")\n\nThe argument for the IF function here is OR(A1 = \"Apple\", A1 = \"Orange\").

If none of them are correct, it returns FALSE.\n\nA: There is also this version :\nIF(A1=\"Apple\",\"Fruit\",IF(A1=\"Orange\",\"Fruit\",\"Not a fruit\"))\n\nWhich does not need OR() at all...\nAnd this is one way of avoiding OR() and IF() using index and match...\nCell B2 shows the function entered in cell B1.\n\n", "Q: How to disable the scroll position saving in Finder?

I'm trying to transcribe a video in Irish Sign Language. That means lots of pausing and playing, and frequently jumping back five seconds. Using the mouse to achieve this is a complete and utter pain. Unfortunately, I'm using the school's Mac computers, which have QuickTime only.\nVLC Media Player on Windows or Ubuntu will take the space bar to pause or play, and the left arrow key to jump back a bit. Can I do anything similar with QuickTime?\n\nA: Yes, there are certainly ways of achieving this result on QuickTime Player. Here are two ways:  \n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the spacebar to play/pause the video as long as your\nactive (front) window is QuickTime Player and not another software, \nperhaps the one that you use to transcribe.\n\n*If you use the left and right arrow keys, you can jump backward and forwards a frame - keep it pressed to speed things up. When used in combination with the Command Key, you can achieve x2 speed rewind/forward, then hit the spacebar to stop at the desired point in the video.  \n\n\nI have to admit that this method requires a little bit of fast keyboard action (compared to other apps) but that is something one can get used to.

I am a Mac user who used to benefit much from the Genius Bar in America.\nNow I relocated to elsewhere without the support and I know so little what to do right now.\nA couple of months ago, I made a lot of change to my Macintosh' directories. I sent most of the archives to iCloud and removed them from the hard drive. Then I bought another laptop so that I can install Windows, the OS needed to run the particulars of South Korean web browsers. Also my Mac was aging (bought 2012, MacBook Pro).\nI was able to locate the iCloud section on my sidebar and check the contents I need are there. But is it something sustainable?\nThe problem of its not synching with my new laptop properly still persists though. The model it is not synching to is MSI GS63 7RD stealth, although I think Windows is causing the problem. Domestic customer contact commented that it sometimes doesn't sync well with non-macOS environment, and that was it.\nInquiry in sum: \n\n\n*\n\n*I would like to ask if anyone restored data using iCloud Drive in a non-MacOS environment with success.

I started the service expecting it could be used in place of external hard drive for backup.. or is it not how it should be used?\n\n\nI currently use macOS High Sierra 10.13.2\n\nA: No single backup destination should be your only backup of important files. iCloud Drive is no exception.\niCloud Drive is supported on Windows as you've found. This folder is synchronised with iCloud Drive, so providing you have an internet connection, the files you add there will be copied to iCloud. Later, on another computer or if you erase your current computer, you can sign in to iCloud again and your files will still be there.\niCloud Drive is not meant to be a backup solution for your files in their current location. You shouldn't expect to store all your files in iCloud Drive on Windows as the integration just isn't there yet. You can add iCloud Drive as a library folder so it appears as part of Documents, but unlike macOS you can't replace your entire Documents folder on Windows with iCloud Drive.\nAn external drive is useful for backups since you take the files on your computer, copy them to the external drive, then remove the drive and place it elsewhere — that's a quintessential backup. iCloud Drive is a little different:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you copy all your documents into iCloud Drive, you're using twice as much storage space on your computer.\n\n*If you move all your documents into iCloud Drive, they're no longer where you left them in your Documents folder or wherever.\n\n\niCloud Drive is great for files you want to synchronise, and can work as a backup solution, but it's not designed for that primarily.\n", "Q: Spotlight search result incomplete Since I changed the directory structures of my Mac, Spotlight has not successfully produced search results for my files or folders. \nI have tried \n\n\n*\n\n*Killing SystemUIServer\n\n*Rebuilding the Spotlight Index manually using sudo mdutil -E /\n\n*Changing Desktop Resolution\n \n\n*Clear caches and preferences using downloaded application\n\n\n*Rebooting Mac\n\n\nAll suggested in this to no effect. 4th item was recommended against on Apple Support Community.

It turns out I have another friend in the same situation in this country. \nIt's uncomfortable that the laptop has to be connected to the cord at all times, but without it I have troubles to deal with anyway. I found out about the kits provided by iFixit, but they don't ship overseas. Plus, lithium-ion batteries have special rules at the customs of the airport; not a daily convenience stuff to ask for friends to smuggle in when they visit for holidays. \nSo I have been wondering for quite long, if you take it to an apple branch in America or other countries with good industrial network, how long does it cost to fix this state?\nI currently use Macbook Pro of 2012. (OS: High Sierra 10.13.2)\n\nA: Wait depends on two factors: a) whether the Apple store or the service provider has the battery in stock; wait for delivery from Apple is probably a day or two; and b) the existence (or not) of sufficient techs at the store or shop to do the work that customers have ordered. If work is backed up, it'll take longer.\nA battery change should take .5 - 1 hr, and if the customer is lucky (i.e., battery in stock and a tech available), might be able to be accomplished while the customer waits. \n\nA: That's a bit painful. I would ask if they have a mail in option.\nI just had my MacBook repaired for this issue and it took me 30 minutes on the phone to report the issue / confirm my shipping address. I received a pre-paid FedEx container around 4 PM. I dropped it off to FedEx at 7 PM - it entered repair in Houston, TX around 5 AM the next day and was back to shipping 6 hours later. Now, this was perfect timing and near a large city in the US - but the machine was out of my hands for a day and a morning.\nI can see them quoting 10 days if they are not going to order parts - and if the shipping of the parts takes 2-3 days and they allow for the chance that some other part fails and an extra time for shipping / testing.\nI see our Apple Stores quoting 5 to 7 days for repairs since they can't be as efficient or stocked as the repair centers for mail in service.\n", "Q: (preferably) free app to lock iPhone for predetermined periods of time Reading here\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask\nmy understanding is that I can ask question about third-party Apple software, as long as I don't ask \"which is your favourite app to do something\". However, there is also a Software Recommendations site on Stack Exchange so I'm a bit confused as to whether my question is on-topic or not...please migrate my question to Software Recommendations if it's off-topic here.\nConcerning duplicates, I've searched the site and I found\nAny way to automatically lock *Me* out from *My Own* iPhone for a specific amount of time?\nThe answers don't satisfy me, because I don't want to jailbreak my phone. I know for sure that today there are some paid apps which don't require jailbreaking and allow me to disable the Internet connection (both WiFi and cellular data, but not cellular voice) with a recurring schedule, for example from 9 PM to 8 AM. Are there also free apps?\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*the app should \"resist\" attemps to force the block, but it's not necessary that it's 100% tampering-proof. Its main use will be preventing kids to access the Internet after a certain hour, it's not like it must resist hacker attacks :-)\n\n*the schedule should be configurable\n\n*it should be possible (but not easy) to overcome the block if needed. For example, one evening it may be necessary to use the cell phone after dinner. In that case, for example pressing a button and then waiting 15 minutes with the screen on should allow to stop the block.\n\n\nIf free apps don't exist or have glaring flaws, I will accept suggestions for paid apps, but I'd prefer free apps.\n\nA: There are no App Store apps which are able to prevent other apps from being opened. Apple does not provide such functionality to apps, so you will not be able to find an app which is able to do this.\nPreventing apps from being used is something the OS can do for some native apps. See Settings → General → Restrictions for being able to set a passcode to prevent access to certain functionality on the device.\n\nA: A bit of it may be possible with a custom profile on a managed (!) device(iPhone)... but it requires a Mac with Apple configurator... to create these profiles and to set the iPhone as managed...\n", "Q: iMessage doesn't work on my devices iMessage and FaceTime throw an activation error any time I try to login on both of my devices (Mac Mini 2011 and iPad Pro 9.7). This happens since Dec 20 and I can't fix it.\nIt looks that I have tried everything that is told when you google for \"imessage authentication/activation error\" / \"could not sign in to imessage\" / \"iMessage doesn't work\" and other stuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*obviously reboot\n\n*set the time to auto-since with Apple servers\n\n*reset nvram on Mac\n\n*remove sim from iPad and put it back in\n\n*reset network settings\n\n*logout and log back in to iCloud via System Preferences\n\n*change Apple ID password, disable/enable two-step auth\n\n*\"wait 24 hours\"\n\n*tried both with home Wi-Fi and via cellular data on iPad\n\n*finally... created NEW Apple ID first on Mac, then created another one on iPad.\n\n\n... and it doesn't work.\n\nAll my software is up to date and I can successfully use iCloud storage and everything else that includes interaction with Apple ID - except of FaceTime and iMessage.\nThe curious thing is that it stopped working simultaneously on both my devices. The more curious thing is the impossibility to use another Apple ID - I have created three new Apple IDs trying to fix the problem.\nI don't have an iPhone and never had.\nThis sounds ridiculous to happen at all. Has anyone encountered the similar problem?\nI'm not sure what could have triggered that. I haven't changed my devices recently. I don't use VPN.\n\nA: If you are signed in to both devices with using the same Apple ID then call Apple Support and have them check if your iMessage is registered and active. If so then they can help you fix it from there. \nIf you are not registered or activated then they can have you re-register and that should fix the issue.\n\nA: Actually, I have fixed it long ago, but forgot that I asked my question here.\nThe problem was that for whatever reason, Apple has blocked my iMessage, by mistake. It was actually procedure intended to help against spammers, but seems that it has encountered a false positive on my account.\nAfter a phone call to Apple, they unblocked my iMessage and I had never run into that problem since.\n\nIt's funny though, that creating a new Apple ID didn't help that time. Appears that Apple is tracking what Apple ID's are used on every device for this purpose.\n", "Q: How to disable notifications for a single mailbox in Mail? When managing multiple mailboxes, is it possible to disable the notifications for certain mailboxes?\n\n\nA: To disable notification for certain Mailboxes you can create Smart Mailboxes for the accounts that you want notifications, and change the settings to enable only them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Smart Mailbox through the menu Mailbox > New Smart Mailbox including only the Accounts that you want to receive notifications.\n\n\n*Inside Preferences > General change the Dock unread count and New message notifications putting the name of the Smart Mailbox or group of Smart Mailbox created.\n\n\nA: The simplest way I can think of is to remove the general New Message sound...\n\nThen add it back for specific accounts...\n\nThis is a simplified version of the method I use for rules splitting emails off to different folders per purpose. I only want to be notified for the ones I consider important, not every Facebook announcement.\nEdit:\nI just realised you might mean the actual banner notifications - this, unfortunately can only be honed in very broad strokes...\n\nI've found the solution to that is if I don't want to be notified, I use rules to move to another folder, one which gets no notification, i.e. not Inbox.\nThis does mean you can end up with quite an array of folders... but each serves a purpose.\nI actually normally leave the sub-folders closed, including Inbox, because the account they came to is no longer an important part of the filing.\n\n", "Q: Blurred Effect option for Portrait Mode on iOS11?

The Isolating the Crash\n section will be of most help in this case, as well as: How to Read the Panic Log from an Intel-Based Mac as knowing how to read the log will help you debug it. \n", "Q: Changing the Apple ID on a 1st generation iPad We are trying to add apps to our 1st generation iPad. We reset to factory settings and need to add some apps to it. I tried signing in with the same Apple ID that is on our other iPad and my husbands iPhone. It says that I need to reenter the password and add a verification code that is found on our other devices. However, when we try to sign in again, it never gives us the option to enter the verification code so we have been unable to download any apps leaving this iPad virtually useless. All the apps require iOS 9 or higher and this generation's highest available version is iOS 5 so we can't download directly. I need to be able to change the Apple ID on the iPad so we can share apps between our devices. \n\nA: The old iPad doesn't know about verification codes so doesn't know how to ask for it properly. You can still sign in by adding the verification code to the end of your usual password in the normal password box when trying to log in.\n", "Q: Swiping between spaces changed A couple days ago, my MacBook updated to Mac OS X 10.13.2 (17C88), and since then, the swiping between spaces has been fickle.\nBefore the update, I just had to swipe with three fingers (as per the setting) and the screen with my mouse cursor would switch to the desire space.\nSince the update, I occasionally have to click with the trackpad to initiate the switch.  Without clicking it does nothing.  However, once clicked it works without clicking for a while (like it did before).

I've recently started using a Mac after using Windows for 20+ years and one annoying thing is that I have to re-learn all the shortcuts. I've found that you can change small stuff like swapping the Ctrl, Fn and Option buttons, but the shortcuts themselves would still be different from what I am used to. I've also found Karabiner helpful for remapping individual keys, but it won't let me create more complex rules, such as assigning Alt-Tab to change between Windows.\nIs there a program/extension/terminal command that would allow me to remap any shortcut in the system to any other shortcut combination? \n\nA: The answer to my question is to use Karabiner along with their set of complex key modifications titled \"PC-Style Shortcuts\". You can also add modifications of your own by editing the ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json file.\nThe only shortcut I couldn't get working is using Alt+Shift to switch between input languages, but it's probably doable using more advanced scripting. I'm instead using Macs built-in language toggling using the Caps lock key. Top this off with Witch to enable Windows-style toggling between applications/windows and you get a full PC experience, completely customizable to your personal needs.\n\nA: I agree with all the comments so far, your better off learning the Mac shortcuts. That being said, you can change a lot of shortcuts using the keyboard preferences:\nApple Menu > System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\nMost of the finder an system shortcuts are in there. You can then create your own ones by selecting \"App Shortcuts\", click the + button, select the app you want to modify, enter the menu title and a shortcut. This happen live with the application open. Have a dig around, you'd be surprised how many tasks can be changed.\nRemember also that the Mac uses gestures a lot. Sometime they are faster than keyboard shortcuts if you have a touchpad.\nApple Menu > System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard\nClick the \"Modifier Keys\" button bottom right and swap the Alt/Option key and the Command key if needed.\nYou could also try Witch by ManyTricks\n\nA: Changing shortcuts from one key to another is one thing, but some functions are inherently different -- like the way that Command Tab cycles between applications, not windows.\nThere is no built-in functionality to cycle between all windows that you can assign to a key command. You may be able to find third-party software that will provide such functions, of course.\nUltimately: \"different platform is different\", and there's only so much that can be done to mirror the familiar environment.\n", "Q: Can messages be intercepted?

It's easy to write an Applescript to open a Finder window to a certain folder, e.g. \ntell application \"Finder\" to open \"Macintosh HD:Users:Username:Downloads\"\nIs it possible for Applescript to open a Finder window showing all files tagged, for instance, green?\nThanks! \n\nA: If you can process an array of file paths (instead of opening a Finder window), you can use the mdfind utility:\nset greenFiles to paragraphs of (do shell script \"mdfind \\\"kMDItemUserTags == 'Green'\\\"\")\n\n\nA: \nHere's the workflow as I'm doing it now: I copy a phrase, open Finder and click on green tags. I copy/paste that phrase to find the filename that contains it. It then gets opened in Preview, from whence i print it. I do this hundreds of times a day, and have a programmable keypad that saves me lots of clicks. It'll run Applescripts.\n\nSince it's now clear that you don't actually require the files to be displayed in a Finder window in order to achieve your ultimate objective, I borrowed the suggestion from @apple9321 and used mdfind to retrieve the files paths and match the filenames against the contents of the clipboard.\nThe first half of the script below performs these tasks.  Sorry the script appears so long—it's actually not, as most of it taken up by comments that I added to help guide you through what each part of the script does.  Copy-n-Paste it into Script Editor and run it (with suitable text already sitting on your clipboard).\n    -- Get the text from the clipboard\n    -- to use for searching filenames\n    set SearchTerm to the clipboard as text\n    set SearchTerm to quoted form of ([\"*\", SearchTerm, \"*\"] as text)\n\n    -- Run a bash command to retrieve all\n    -- files with a green tag and a filename\n    -- that includes the above search term\n    -- (case-insensitive)\n    set Command to [\"mdfind \", ¬\n        \"\\\"((kMDItemUserTags = '*Green*'cd) \", ¬\n        \"&& (kMDItemDisplayName = \", ¬\n        SearchTerm, ¬\n        \"cd))\\\"\"] as text\n\n    try -- Run the bash command and get a list of file paths\n        set FileList to paragraphs of (do shell script Command)\n    on error -- No matching filenames, script terminates\n        return 0\n    end try\n\n    -- Convert the string file paths to a class\n    -- that AppleScript can use to reference the files\n    repeat with PathToFile in FileList\n        set end of FileList to POSIX file PathToFile\n        set FileList to rest of FileList\n    end repeat\n\n    -- Open the files in Preview and print the documents.\n    -- You may not need to actually need to include the\n    -- `open` command, as I believe Preview will still\n    -- be able to run a `print` command if you hand it a\n    -- list of file references, e.g. print FileList\n    tell application \"Preview\"\n        open FileList\n        -- You can omit `with properties` or just\n        -- include the print settings you want\n        -- (see the AppleScript \"Preview\" dictionary\n        -- for details of other available settings)\n        print documents with properties ¬\n            {copies:1, target printer:\"Epson Stylus Photo PX830\"}\n    end tell\n\nThe latter half of the script does some housework with the file types to make them useable, but then it's simple enough for AppleScript to open the file(s) in Preview and print them off.\nI have to put a disclaimer here, and state that I haven't been able to test the print command for Preview in AppleScript.  This is because I don't have a printer.  But my strong feeling is that this ought to work with few, if any, tweaks, and would probably even allow you to print without opening the files first:\n    tell application \"Preview\" to print FileList\n\nBut, as I said, I cannot physically test it myself and I'm going by what's implied from Preview's AppleScript dictionary (which also contains a list of available print settings should you need to specify these from inside the script—I specified copies and target printer merely as two examples that appeared to be the most useful, but these aren't required).\nDoes this sound like it meets your needs ?\nYour programmable keypad sounds like a good way to trigger this script after copying the search phrase to the clipboard.  The alternative method I would have suggested for others who don't have such a device would be to create an Automator service, to which a shortcut (hotkey) can be assigned to trigger the script that way; or allow the service to be triggered after highlighting some text and right-clicking in order to send this text straight into the service as an alternative to copying it to the clipboard.\nOne final note: I chose mdfind in this instance because you implied that you wanted to search through every green-tagged file on your hard drive, and this does it faster than builtin AppleScript commands.  However, if you only need to search green-tagged files in a specific folder or a couple of folders, it may be better to use builtin AppleScript commands (depending on how many files are in these folders).  If you find files missing from the results of mdfind, you may need to re-index Spotlight (sudo mdutil -Ea from Terminal).  It takes a while to rebuild the metadata store but any files omitted from the search results that should appear will now be there.  You can preview the full list of search results in Terminal by entering this command: mdfind \"kMDItemUserTags == 'Green'\", which ought to list all green-tagged files.\nShould you need any help or have any further queries, leave a comment and I'll get back to you.  I can tweak the code if you have specific after-thoughts.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro mid-2012: All applications are \"damaged or incomplete\", question mark on all apps, no icons Over the past couple days I have experience truly the most bizarre issue with an Apple product I have ever experienced. It has a somewhat long story to it, so I have all relevant details in chronological order.\nFirst off, here's my specs: Macbook Pro Mid-2012 i5 w/ 250GB SSD, 1TB HDD in optical bay, 8GB RAM. Running high sierra 10.13.2\nAlright. So, my computer installed some updates overnight last weekend. Worked fine the next day, except that Spotlight stopped indexing my applications folder. Rather annoying, but not completely bizzare. I tried fixing it by adding the applications folder to the Spotlight blacklist, then remove it. That did nothing.\nMonday night, I tried the following three commands to try to force it to reindex my entire drive: \nsudo mdutil -i on / \nsudo mdutil -i off / \nsudo mdutil -E / \n\nThat did nothing immediately - again, unsurprisingly. But the next day, it still hadn't indexed the drive. The progress bar in Spotlight was stuck at the beginning.\nLast night (Tuesday) was when the really bizzare stuff started happening. I tried to launch Fusion 360 (CAD software) from the dock, to be greeted with a \"Fusion 360 cannot be opened because it is damaged or incomplete.\" I did the reasonable thing, and did a system reboot. I tried opening other software from the dock, but was greeted with the same message for all items in the dock. I then tried opening items from the launchpad, only to be greeted with no apps having icons whatsoever. Same thing with apps directly from my Applications folder - attempting to open any app, including system utilities like Terminal and Disk utility - resulted in the same damaged or incomplete error. Additionally, all the apps had their icons missing in the Applications folder. Right-clicking > show package content > browsing to the actual executable also does not work - it asks what software you would like to open the file with. I would have launched them from the terminal, but... well... I can't open it!\nAt this point, I got seriously freaked out about a corrupted drive, malware, etc, so I shut it down for the night. Today, I pulled the drive and took a full image of it for backup purposes. After some SMART analysis and the massive copy without any errors (used ddrescue on a linux box to clone the drive to an iso), I can say definitively that the SSD is not dying. After backing up the drive, I booted off a recovery USB drive and ran first aid on the main partition on the SSD, which found no errors.\nI also tried other user accounts. First I tried another admin account, and google chrome launched on login fine, but no other software would open. After quitting google chrome, it refused to open again - same damaged or incomplete error. I then tried the guest account, where all the app icons on the dock are replaced with question marks. Again, nothing would open. However, I could open \"About This Mac\", and get a system report, etc. Clicking on software update results in a cryptic error about not being able to find the app to open that link with.\nI also know that it isn't a broken SATA cable, as I've booted off a clone of the drive via USB and it has all the same issues.\nAt this point, I plan on doing a full OS reinstall and copying stuff back from my disk image. But if anyone has any idea why this happened in the first place, or what I could do to repair it short of doing a full reinstall, let me know. If you want screenshots of any of this weirdness (taken with a phone camera, because Preview can't open to take screenshots...) then let me know. Thank for any help!\n\nA: Following your initial description, I had the exact same problem. But it wasn't a malicious cable. So, for future reference and people with this problem, this is my solution, which is way more easier: \nLet's assume you don't even have access to the terminal / console and therefore you have to boot into recovery mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*(re-)boot into recovery mode (hold CMD + R until Apple logo appears)\n\n*start console / terminal\n\n*locate the folder /private/var/folders/ of your regular installation (!)\n\n\nHeads up: \nIf you are able to run the console within your regular installation, the folder is just there: /private/var/folders/. \nBut if you use the recovery mode console, the /private/var/folders/ is the one of your recovery interface. You need to look for a folder like /Volumes/Macintosh/private/var/folders/ - that's the location of all your regular files. \nIf you get to the correct folder, you just delete it's content. (For security reasons you may move the content of this folder to a temporary location). \nAfter your done, just reboot. This should fix your problem. \nNota bene:\nAs far as i know /private/var/folders/ just contains a lot of temporary files which will be deleted every time you restart your mac. If you are using the hibernation mode, this folder may grow constantly. It also could help to reboot the system while holding the SHIFT-key, as this also runs a few routines that will clear temporary files. \n\nA: My wife's MacBook Air with macOS High Sierra developed a similar problem.  No application could be launched, and even the icons in the dock didn't show up.  \nWhile other articles have suggested deleting everything in /private/var/folders except the zz folder, that was impossible in the normal account.  Finder wouldn't delete anything, and Terminal couldn't be launched.\nI ended up booting into recovery mode, using the Terminal and finding the /private/var/folders of the user account. When booting into recovery mode it will have a /private/var/folders associated with the recovery OS.  From there I was able to rm -R each of the folders and their contents.\nAfter doing that and re-booting normally the computer recovered.  Some account credentials had to be re-entered, but overall the computer was working again.\n", "Q: Upgrade system frameworks without upgrading OS I am currently running macOS 10.10.2, but would like to be able to run the latest Ableton Live 10 which is built on macOS 10.11.

At the bottom of the pane choose the Rebuild option. If you have a large mailbox, you can expect the process to take a few hours.\n  \n*You must repeat this step for each one of your Mailboxes.\n  \n*While the process takes place, you may experience system performance lag, as it can consume a lot of system resources and memory.\n  \n  \n  Another caveat, if you use IMAP or Exchange with any of the accounts, the process will redownload every message from the server, so you'll use a lot of bandwidth.\nNow that you've completed these steps, work with Mail a little longer. If you are still having issues, or Mail fails to launch, you should try a manual reindex.\nStep 2: Re-index\nManual reindexing of Mail messages is the only way to go if the  application has become so unresponsive it barely works at all, search is not functioning correctly or the app won't launch.\nMail will automatically attempt to reindex your messages if it detects problems with the mailboxes, but sometimes a manual reindex is the best option. If you are still having problems with Mail after following step one, try manual reindexing.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Quit Mail if it’s open.\n  To get to your home Library folder, hold down the Option key, then in the Finder choose Go > Library.  \n  \n*In ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData, delete any file that begins with “Envelope Index,” such as Envelope Index or Envelope Index-shm.

I usually have a lot of applications open with lots of windows in each. Let's say I'm working on several documents in a word processor, while having several web browser windows open for reference. I need to switch back and forth between my different documents, and a particular web browser window, which is a Wikipedia article.\nCurrently, to switch to the Wikipedia article, I need to\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ Tab a random number of times (depending on how many applications I have open) to Chrome, then \n\n* Cmd ⌘   `  a number of times (depending on how many Chrome windows I have open) to reach the window with the Wikipedia article.\n\n\nApp switchers like Witch, that can be configured to bring up a list of all open windows from all applications, and lets you switch between them, improves the situation slightly. But it still requires me to browse through a list in order to select a window.\nMy workflow would be much easier if I could assign a keyboard shortcut to that particular Chrome window, to bring it to front.  \nIdeally, it would work like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate the window you want to create a shortcut for (\"window A\")\n\n*Bring up the utility app\n\n*Assign a keyboard shortcut, say Ctrl Alt ⌘W, to \"window A\"\n\n*From now on, pressing Ctrl Alt ⌘W at any time would bring \"window A\" to front\n\n*When \"window A\" is closed, the keyboard shortcut is removed\n\n\nIs there any utility application for macOS that provides this functionality? \n\nA: Keyboard Maestro\nKeyboard Maestro is a paid-for application that allows the creation of hotkeys (amongst many other types of trigger) and has a builtin function to target tabs within Safari or Google Chrome.\nIt references tabs by index number, e.g. tab 1 being the first tab, tab 2 being the second, and so on.\nHere's a macro that took 2 minutes to create and assigns a group of ten hotkeys CmdAlt+0...9, each of which trigger their respective tab in Google Chrome, if the tab exists, and brings it to the foreground (0 represents tab 10 in this instance).\n\nIf you needed to be able to reference tabs by their title rather than a fixed index number (in case you changed the order of the tabs), you'd have to use a bit of AppleScript to achieve a similar result.\nThis piece of AppleScript is of particular value:\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to tell its front window to ¬\n        if exists (first tab whose title contains \"IMDB\") then ¬\n            repeat until active tab's title contains \"IMDB\"\n                set active tab index to ¬\n                    (active tab index mod (number of tabs)) + 1\n            end repeat\n\n\nAlfred\nAn identical result can be achieved with Alfred, in a slightly different construction of its workflow to that of the macro used in Keyboard Maestro.  Alfred doesn't have a builtin command to switch to a specific browser tab, so a little bit of AppleScript has to fill that gap.\nHere's the basic workflow layout:\n\nOn the left, I created just four hotkey triggers, but you can create as many as you wish.  I mirrored the CmdAlt+1,2, ... format I used in Keyboard Maestro for a direct comparison.\nThe superimposed orange-dashed window shows the settings for the second hotkey, specifically in supplying it a numerical parameter—2 in its case—that gets passed as an argument into the subsequent AppleScript.  Each hotkey has a similar numerical parameter it will deliver to that one script upon triggering.\nHere's the AppleScript that performs the action triggered by these hotkeys:\n    on run argv\n\n        set n to argv as number\n\n        tell application \"Google Chrome\" to ¬\n            tell its front window to ¬\n                set the active tab index to n\n\n        activate application \"Google Chrome\"\n\n    end run\n\nIt would be easy enough to add a few lines to include Safari as an option too, depending which browser was active last when the hotkey is triggered.\nAlfred and Keyboard Maestro play quite well together, too, as each has the ability to trigger workflows/macros from external sources, including from each other.  So, an Alfred trigger can initiate a KM macro, and, likewise, a KM trigger can initiate an Alfred workflow.\n\nA: Have you considered giving a try to Mosaic ? it could be a step towards speeding up your workflow.\n", "Q: How do text sizes compare between iPhone X, 8/Plus and SE?

And how much does the Zoomed View setting change the size?\nThis is especially important for elder and weak-eyesight users.\n\nWith release of iPhone X, my earlier question becomes critically outdated, so I decided to create a new one.\n\nA: Identical between pre-X devices; +17% with Zoomed-View; +7% on X\nOn SE, 8 and 8 Plus (and older devices of same form factor) text size is the same between devices, larger screen fits proportionally more text.\nZoomed View gives exactly the smaller-device amount of text in proportionally larger text size. 8 Plus screen is 17% larger than 8's, and SE is 17% larger than 8 (measured by screen height / width).\nConversely, on X the text is size in the middle of Standard-View and Zoomed-View of earlier devices, roughly:\n\n\n*\n\n*7% larger than on 8 (proportional to how X screen is wider than 8)\n\n*9.5% smaller than on 8 Plus in Zoomed-View (proportional to how 8 Plus screen is wider than X)\n\n\nDPI has no effect to text size on the apps I tried, no matter whether or not they support DynamicType system setting.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*%% diffs are between width of equal text in equal apps, with identical settings\n\n*screen width diffs are based on official specs: screen size in pixels divided by PPI\n\n*measured and researched on my own; I would appreciate link to an authoritative source or suggestions on better metrics\n\n", "Q: Microsoft Store button disabled in Word 2016 for Mac I have a user that wants to use an add-in available on the Microsoft store.

The card I'm presented with when I use Apple Pay from my Mac is the wrong one. I've set the default card correctly in iOS (where it appears correctly), but when Apple Pay in invoked from macOS, even when payment is completed on iOS, the wrong card is presented on macOS.\nHow do I set the default card for Apple Pay on macOS?\n\nA: This can happen when you have Apple Pay enabled on your Watch with a different payment option as the default there. There appears to be no way to configure the order in which devices are offered when more than one (Watch and iPhone, for example) are present, so that if Watch is present (unless Watch is disabled for Apple Pay entirely) it will \"jump the queue\" and offer whatever is the default there, independently of what you have set as your default on the iPhone.\nTo prevent this from happening and see your iOS-configured default card on macOS, disable Apple Pay on your watch (Watch > Wallet & Apple Pay, and remove all cards there, including Cash; turning off \"Allow Payments on Mac\" surprisingly doesn't do the trick).\n\nA: encouraged by the previous answer, but not wishing to go through deleting and re-adding my cards, i discovered also this: once i had matching settings on both phone and watch, there was nothing for my macOS device to be confused about. they are located in \n(Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > Default Card)\nand\n(Watch app on phone > My Watch > Wallet & Apple Pay > Default Card)\nrespectively. \n", "Q: How to get a password hash through terminal in Recovery Mode?

I have hundreds of slides, so need something automated. To be clear, each slide is a single page in the PDF.\nI do realize this is a rehash of this question, but after exploring the answers, they either a) do not work for current versions of Keynote, b) are no longer available, or c) are not automated. The app mentioned in the first answer seems like it might be workable, but requires access to an older version of Keynote in order to update the file produced by the app, such that it is then eligible for the current versions of Keynote. I do not have access to older versions of Keynote.\n\nA: Launch Keynote\nAs mac Keynote cannot open PDF directly, you will need to launch Keynote by opening an existing Keynote file. Just click on the    file,    and Keynote will automatically open the file.\nDrag and drop the PDF you want to convert to Keynote to left side where all the Keynote pages are listed in thumbnails. You can    move up    and down while dragging the PDF to the Keynote. On the    right panel,    you can choose style, image and arrange icons to    tweak the setting of    imported PDF.\nGo to File > Save to save the Keynote file.

With a \"good\" PDF, the size issue should be solved.\nEdit 2: A workaround for the second issue is to pull one page into your keynote and then select the PDF on that new page and check its size under \"format\". In my example its 842x595pt. Create a new Keynote and adjust the page dimension in the document settings to this size. Then pull in all the pages. They should now fill each slide. You can select all slides and chose an appropriate background, like plain white, for example. Having selected all those slides, you can change the format back to what you want (like 4:3) and it should scale them up accordingly.\nStill, I hope someone comes up with a smoother solution.\n\nA: This answer is obviously several years later, but the pdf2keynote script here is fantastic at doing just what the OP is asking:\nhttps://github.com/remymuller/pdf2keynote\n", "Q: Force BootCamp to use GPT I have installed BootCamp manually to the last partition on my SSD /dev/disk0s13. It works, no problems, but every time I manage my partitions from OS X (or any other OS that is not Windows), the computer creates a new hybrid MBR, which makes Windows unbootable because it can’t find the Windows partition. I have to manually remove hybrid MBR via gdisk every time I manage my partitions.\nI have a MacBook Pro 2015 13\" Model with 512 GBs of storage and has 6 Operating Systems installed on it. I have macOS High Sierra and OS X Yosemite installed. I mostly use High Sierra.\nIs there any possible way to either stop OS X from creating hybrid MBR or force Windows to use GPT? By the way, I'm using Bitlocker, not sure if it makes a difference.\nUPDATE 1: I was trying to reproduce hybrid MBR with Disk Utility, and I discovered Disk Utility no longer produces that problem. Not sure about GParted.\n\nA: If you have hybrid partitioning, then Windows will only see the partitions defined in the MBR table. There is no workaround for this. High Sierra removes hybrid partitioning in favor of a fully protected MBR. Yosemite can convert to hybrid, especially if partitions 2, 3 and/or 4 in the GPT are type EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7.\n\nNote: Type EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 will appear as Microsoft Basic Data in output from diskutil list.\n\n", "Q: Random shutdowns that look like kernel panic But with no sign of kernel panic in the console. The screen just turns black all of a sudden, but the backlight stays on. After up to 10 seconds, it shuts down completely.

They had me reset NVRAM and SMC, still no change. I booted into a linux distro from an external drive and used it for more than 12 hours without any interruption. Although not definitive, this strongly suggests that this might be a software problem rather than an hardware problem. If so, how could I pinpoint a problem that doesn't show up in the console? I'm using 10.11.6.\nEdit: I should also add that this happens in irregular intervals. It can be as frequent as once in 20 minutes, or as sporadic as every 5 hours.\n\nA: Go into recovery mode and reinstall MacOS. That sounds like a software issue.

I got a new iPhone and since I had installed a lot of things over time I don't need/want anymore on my old one, I installed the new from scratch, downloading apps, adding the needed accounts, imported WhatsApp msgs via WhatsApp backup etc.\nNow what's missing is e.g. my old SMS/iMessage and Signal history.\nSince there's no export/import mechanism I tend to use iCloud Backup to get the missing pieces from the old to the new iPhone - and to save space and make it fast I removed everything I already have like music (can be synced later) and photos (already on my Mac in Lightroom) and most of the apps.\nQuestion now: If I create a new iCloud backup on the old iPhone with only a small set of apps (thus focusing on SMS/iMessage) and restore it on the new iPhone, will this just add the missing pieces or also clean up the new device and remove everything that's not in the backup (and by that destroy everything I already set up)?\nAnd if it would destroy existing data: is there any other way to get SMS/iMessages into the new device?\n\nA: Restoring an iCloud Backup will cause you to lose existing data. As part of the procedure to restore an iCloud Backup, one chooses Settings → General → Reset → Erase All Content and Settings. Therefore your data on your existing device is gone.\nIt may be possible to perform a delta restore of an iTunes backup. Make sure both devices are running the same version of iOS, then…\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your current device (and your new device in case anything goes wrong) using iTunes.\n\n*Using iBackupBot, open the backup you made of your old device and find the messages data in the messages container in the backup.\n\n*Use iBackupBot's restore functionality to restore this data on to your new device.\n\n", "Q: How to disable lock-screen hotkey (Command-ctr-Q) in High Sierra?

Because the F-keys are special, if you encounter controversial behavior, check System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and disable the shortcuts that hinder your own mappings. I haven't overwritten my F-keys so I can't remember if remapping them with BetterTouchTool causes controversy or not, but if it does, see System Preferences. It's easier to keep track of what functions dominate if you can aim to keep all the rules in one place.\n\nA: Use case:\nSometimes, we are working or gaming and our app may have useful functionality bound to F-keys. So we want our \"Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" setting ON.\nOther times when we are consuming content, we would like the setting OFF in order to easily adjust brightness and volume of the computer.

I used to have only a 500gb SSD for my MacBook Pro, but later came across a 1TB SSD that I wanted to switch to using. Instead of using the 'recommended' method, I opted for the dirty route and just connected another MBP in Target Disk Mode via Thunderbolt and used pv /dev/rdisk0 > /dev/rdisk(x) x = whichever disk for the 1TB at the time. \nHowever, prior to copying the entire contents over to the 1TB SSD, I used rEFInd and installed a copy of Kali Linux as a dual boot, which I've been running with.....minimal issues for quite some time now.\nSo the 'dirty' copy worked as planned, the 1TB SSD boots fine and, after a quick reinstallation of rEFInd, everything runs perfectly as it ever has - except now I have an additional 500gb of 'Free Space' at the very end of the 1TB SSD. \nI've tried booting to an external OS X drive and using Disk Utility (both from Yosemite Disk Utility and El Capitan Disk Utility), to expand/merge/delete/create anything to do with this 'Free Space' - without any working results.\nSo my question is: how can I reclaim this 500gb of space at the END of my 1TB SSD, without compromising any of the other partitions (including primary OS X, Recovery, rEFInd, Kali Linux & Linux Swap), and merge it with my primary partition so I can actually use this space?\nHere are some visuals of my partition layout and other various info to help see what I mean...\n\n\n\n\nA: If you hesitate to dd partitions or backup and restore your data with Time Machine, you may convert the first OS X partition of your disk to a Physical Volume and create a Logical Volume Group. After creating a second partition in the free space you can add it to your LVG and expand your current Logical Volume.\nThe approach is similar to a Fusion Drive (two Physical Volumes -> one Logical Volume Group/Logical Volume) however using only one disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Macintosh HD\n\n*Attach a backup drive and use Time Machine to backup Macintosh HD.\n\n*Detach the backup drive\n\n*Open Disk Utility and add a JHFS+ partition in the free space (~500 GB)\n\n*Enter diskutil list to list all partitions\n\n*Enter diskutil cs convert /dev/disk0s2 to convert your main volume to CoreStorage\n\n*Enter diskutil cs list to get all CoreStorage items \n\n*Enter diskutil cs addDisk lvgUUID diskYsZ to add the new empty 500 GB partition as Physical Volume to the Logical Volume Group. \nlvgUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume Group, diskYsZ is the disk identifier of the empty partition 500 GB partition (probably disk0s6).

If you get an error regarding missing space use a slightly smaller size like 849g).\n\n*Enter diskutil verifyDisk disk0 and diskutil verifyVolume disk0s2.\n\n\nThe pros:\nit's fast; it takes about 3 minutes.\nThe cons:\nyour CoreStorage LVG is non-contiguous and \"fragmented\".\n\nA: Disk Utility cannot help you with resizing your original partition by merging it with free space when there's another partition in the middle of it.\nYou will need to first move the Rescue and Linux partitions to the end of the disk - luckily you have plenty of free disk space to accomplish this. Start by creating two new partitions at the end of the drive - matching the exact same sizes as your Recovery and Linux partitions. Then use dd to move your the two file system to their new location. \nThen after that is completed, you can remove the original Recovery and Linux partitions and change the size of the Macintosh partition. Then finally you need to resize the filesystem contained in the Macintosh partition.\nIt is a complicated route, but this is the way to go if you want to do it all on the same disk.\nIf you have a separate USB hard drive or similar with sufficient space - it is much easier to simply backup everything on their and then repartition and reformat your new 1 TB SSD from scratch.  \n", "Q: Apple Mac Pro - reload OS for a beginner's new start?

Use a solid background color rather than an image.\n\nYou might also want to look into how many Triggers you have activated, as they are known to decrease performance. You can find these in Settings -> Profiles -> Advanced -> Triggers.\nPasting Performance in iTerm\nI couldn't replicate your issue on my computer with this short text, but making it about 20 times longer the same happens here. My guess is that iTerm thinks that you are typing and redraws the whole text every time it sees a new character. The same happens on vim in macOS and Ubuntu (see here enter link description here)\nFixing Pasting Performance in iTerm\nThere does not seem to be an easy fix for these performance problems. If the FAQ did not help I suggest to use this command:\npbpaste >> test.sh && chmod +x test.sh && ./test.sh && rm test.sh\n\npbpaste accesses the clipboard (try pbpaste on its own) and >> test.sh writes it into the file test.sh. chmod+x test.sh will allow test.sh to be run from the terminal, ./test.sh runs it and rm test.sh will remove all files called test.sh. This works exactly the same as pasting it but without the performance decrease actually pasting it brings\n\nA: In your ~/.zshrc file (create it if it's not there) you can set DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS=true and it will disable bracketed-paste-magic which is causing this issue.\n", "Q: How to transfer the live photos to Mac via AirDrop? Before the update to High Sierra, when I received live photos via AirDrop, the system always asked I want to save them to the downloads folder or import it into the Photos app. When I choosing the second option, the imported live photos could then be exported as files to a disc, where for each live photo there were two files — an image and a short video.\nAfter the update to High Sierra, the system immediately, without asking, saves the photos received through AirDrop into the downloads folder, with only JPG/HEIF files, without the live component video files.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: This is not the fix but a workaround.\nI exactly have the same issue with you. The interesting thing is that if someone send me Live Photos via AirDrop, (he is using iPhone 6), my laptop running High Sierra would give me the option to import via Photos app. But if I try to send live photos via AirDrop from my iPhone 7, I have no way of importing them directly into Photo app, and all I get is JPGs in download folder. I have been googling to see if anyone can offer solutions but so far, nothing except people are guessing as it is a bug...\nBut I really wanted to transfer my Live Photos wireless. And my solution was to use \"Shared Albums\" in iCloud. (I'm not sharing the album necessarily. Simply this is for me only.) I tested a few times and I see that Live Photos are intact under Shared Albums in Photo app on my laptop. Then I select them and import into Photo app. I can also add Live Photos from my laptop in the Shared Album, and I can grab them in my iPhone as well. \nAnother cool thing about this is \"A shared album can hold up to 5000 photos and videos. The photos and videos in your shared albums are kept in iCloud, but they don't count against your iCloud storage limit.\" Although for me, I'll keep the album empty after importing photos.\nHere is more info on Shared Album from Apple website:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202786\nTill Apple can fix the bug, this is my workaround to import live photos on my iPhone without USB cable.\n\nA: Tap on the share icon and then tap Options.\n\nThen Turn on All Photos Data.\n\n\nA: If you are sharing between two devices with the same Apple ID (or, I think, within the same family), it will automatically save the photo to downloads, but between different iCloud accounts, it should give you a prompt where you can select to open with Photos instead (which should preserve the live photo). See https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/use-airdrop-to-share-photos-pht1d4c62349/mac\nOther options are:\n\n*\n\n*(if sending to yourself) Use the Photos app with iCloud, where you can just open Photos, sync, and get the live photo on you desktop.\n\n*Copy and send iCloud link - the live photo will be playable from the link sent and it will download a zip containing all photos and videos.\n\n*Save as video (from share menu) and share that\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Late 2011 worth upgrading? I recently bought an MacBook Pro Late 2011 with an i7 2.2 GHz and 4 GB of RAM. I wanted to get started in some mobile development and learn how to work with macOS. So this was a good offer online.\nUntil now I am happy with this product. But of course 4 GB of RAM are not much when you develop. \nI mainly want to work with React Native and eventually with libGDX.\nMy question is. Is it worth to upgrade to 8 or even 16 GB of RAM or is it a waste of money for this \"old\" MacBook? Can I expect it to hold a few more years?\n\nA: I have a Late 2011 MacBook Pro (2.4 Ghz) bought in 2012. I have upgraded it with a SSD and 8GB RAM. I still run El Capitan as with Sierra the fans kick in often. I even tried High Sierra, but its slow. I use Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs on it and they run well without any issues.\nIf you want to do mobile development (iOS), I believe you have to settle with Sierra as High Sierra may run very hot with XCode and iOS simulators. And if you are running multiple intensive tasks, then it will be laggy.\nOne more issue with Sierra I found is that CPU Kernel issue. Most of the time CPU Kernel will be busy with 300-500% CPU usage. You can upgrade the RAM to 16GB, but the development environment will be old as High Sierra could be the last compatible OS for this MBP.\n\nA: I've got a late 2011 at home, as well as a mid-2012 at work, and yeah, it's definitely worth upgrading.  High Sierra runs great on it, and with that i7, you should be able to continue to use it for quite some time.\nThat said, Apple made a decision \"for you\" that you should be aware of.  With Sierra, Apple forced the OS to reserve 1.5GB RAM (the amount can vary depending on the model) for video, in order to properly support 4K external displays.  So, if you have 4GB RAM, you're actually only left with 2.5GB, and your system will be sluggish (and there's no setting for adjusting that on most models).\nThe official word for RAM on that generation of MBP's is 8GB RAM supported.  However, there are lots of accounts on the Internet of folks successfully upgrading to 16GB RAM with no issues, and I can say that I have done so myself and am entirely happy with it.   If your work is RAM-intensive, it's well worth the extra few bucks (Euros, name your currency) to go up to 16GB.\nI also just replaced the old hard drive with a 500GB SSD on my home laptop, and I would recommend that to anyone, the boot/load performance boost is great.  You'll need an external connector/bay for cloning your old drive to the new one, and you can clone with the built-in drive tool, or use a third-party app like Super Duper.  You may also want to consider upgrading the file system to APFS when you're done, so that you can take advantage of the new features there.\nBottom line: Go for it!  You'll keep that thing blazing for years.\n", "Q: Auto Sync Photos App with local folder I have all my pictures locally stored on my Macbook in a folder called Pictures. I use the Photos.app to search and filter my pictures.\nI don't use CLoud or anything else so disabled 'Copy pictures to picture library'. Then I imported all the pictures into Photos.app.\nNow when I have new pictures I copy them into my Pictures folder but Photos.app does not add those new pictures. I have to import them every time manually.\nWhats the best way to get new pictures automatically into photos.app?\n\nA: Photos.app is not designed to \"sync\" its contents with folders in the way you described.  I don't believe it ever was, even with iPhoto.  However, it's fairly easy to automate the process of importing photos into Photos.app from a chosen watched folder.\nA watched folder in MacOS is one that is monitored for changes to its contents or to the files themselves.  When such a change occurs, e.g. a new file is added, it triggers a Folder Action.\nA Folder Action is typically an AppleScript or Automator workflow that performs a series of automated actions in response to being triggered by changes to the watched folder to which the folder action is attached.\nSo, simply put:\n① A file is added to a specific folder ➔ ② An AppleScript is triggered to perform some actions\nMy suggestion would be to choose a folder you want monitored by the system, and use this folder to put your photos in to have them automatically imported into Photos.app.\nI describe how to set up a folder action here (Steps 1 to 6).\nThis is the AppleScript that will do the importing, and to which the steps to create a folder action pertain:\n    on adding folder items to ThisFolder after receiving MediaFiles\n\n        set ListOfMediaExtensions to {\"jpeg\", \"jpg\", \"tiff\", \"tif\", \"png\", ¬\n            \"gif\", \"heic\", \"heif\", \"raw\", \"dng\", \"mov\", \"mp4\", \"mp4v\", \"m4v\"}\n\n        repeat with ThisFile in the MediaFiles\n            tell application \"Finder\" to ¬\n                if name extension of ThisFile is in the ListOfMediaExtensions then ¬\n                    set the end of MediaFiles to ThisFile as alias\n            set MediaFiles to the rest of MediaFiles\n        end repeat\n\n        tell application \"Photos\"\n            run\n            delay 2\n            import the MediaFiles\n            quit\n        end tell\n\n    end adding folder items to\n\nIt's a basic script, and folder actions and AppleScript are, of course, capable of doing a lot more (moving files, deleting files, adding photos to albums, tagging them with keywords, etc.)  But in the absence of those sorts of requests, I felt it best to keep things simple and focus on getting it working.\nThe script does, however, include a few lines of code that filter the files added to the folder by extension name, to ensure files such as text files are ignored, and only media files (photos and videos) get imported.\nYou'll know the script has been successful when Photos.app sends a notification to report that a number of photos were successfully imported.  But, as the script stands just now, you won't see the Photos.app appear on your screen at any point (this can be changed if you'd prefer to have it show you the imported photos).\n\nA final couple of considerations: the way you've chosen to set up Photos.app to not copy the files into its library, but rather keep them available in Finder and merely referenced from inside the Photos.app is what's called a Referenced Library.  It is worth taking a moment to read this page here on the disadvantages of a referenced library in Photos.app.  Of course, you may decide that none of the drawbacks particularly affect you, and needn't concern yourself with changing your system.\nLastly, I would suggest that the folder you choose as your watched folder be different than the one you ultimately have your photos residing in.  If you use the same folder, you can accidentally trigger the folder action and import duplicates (although, Photos.app does check to see if duplicates are being imported and asks you what to do in those instances).  The folder action won't attempt to import files that are already in the folder, so that's not the concern; it will trigger and act upon new files added (good!), or any files that change (maybe less good!).  Therefore, renaming a file, editing a photo and re-saving it, or moving it out of the folder and then back in, will all cause the folder action to trigger and act upon that file which you might not want re-imported.\nYou can decide what is best given your habits, and using the same \"Pictures\" folder as both a watched folder and the base for storage could still be done if you bear those caveats I mentioned in mind.  You could always place the watched folder inside your \"Pictures\" folder so it's nearby to drop your new photos in.\nIf you use a separate folder as your \"watched\" folder, then you'll want to add one further line to the AppleScript that will move the files out of the watched folder so that are placed into your \"Pictures\" folder.\nA line like this will do it:\n    tell application \"Finder\" to move the MediaFiles to (POSIX file \"/path/to/pictures/folder\" as alias)\n\nIf you've any questions or need more help, leave a comment and I'l get back to you.\n", "Q: What causes a random giant mouse cursor?

I'm have wake issues on my late 2012 Mac mini but one thing I've realised is I don't know when it is going to sleep, to diagnose if it always fails on sleep, or only sometimes. \nDuring the day the screen will go off and it will wake but after a night, it often won't come back.\nHow can I tell my Mac has gone to sleep mode in the first place? I've wondered before when seeing the light on my USB mini-hub is still on and the blue light on the external HDD, if it is not sleeping when it should be, since USB power should cease when it's asleep?\n\nA: I own the same model of Mac mini as you.  I use it without a monitor, so have become quite tuned in to observing when it's in sleep mode and when it's not, which determines whether or not I can connect remotely from my other machine across subnets.\nThe white light at the front is your indicator.  \nWhen the Mac mini is awake, it maintains constant, full brightness.\nWhen the Mac mini is asleep, the white light begins to \"breathe\", as its intensity oscillates between dim and full brightness at about the rate of a person breathing at rest.  It's a gradual waxing and waning, but once you notice it, you'll be able to spot it easily.\nIf you want a slightly more technical option to verify whether or not your Mac mini is awake or asleep, one option is to ping its IP address from another device on your local network.  This assumes that your Mac mini automatically connects to your network upon waking, which is usually the case, but if it doesn't manage to re-establish Wi-Fi networking for any reason, then a ping request will fail even when the machine is awake.  If you don't have another computer to send a ping, there are numerous networking apps available on Android and iOS devices that can do this, and some will even explicitly tell you when a device is awake or asleep by whether or not it registers a network presence.\n", "Q: Faster and more efficient alternative for Tunnelblick I have to use Tunnelblick (VPN) to be able to connect to a server, the problem is that Tunnelblick is very buggy and laggy and sometimes also causes wierd problems like overheating when the laptop is folded (it does not shut off).

Time machine is not as straight forward as it appears.  The scenario I am looking to do, is within the Time Machine application, I would like to delete one or more backups that were made in the middle but leave some of the oldest earliest backups, and of course keep the most current backups.  This is to recover space and keep a record of my system as it was in certain known points in time just in case.  I use an external hard drive that is formatted in Mac format (HFS).\nThe Time Machine UI permits deleting all backups and deleting all backups before a given point but it does not seem to have an option to blow away just a specified backup (or backups) in the middle.\nIs there a way to do this using the Time Machine UI?\n\nA: You can do this with the Time Machine CLI: tmutil delete /path/to/backup\n$ tmutil listbackups\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-04-142408\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-05-003504\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-06-005409\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-07-014517\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-08-023925\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-09-040035\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-10-043920\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-11-055340\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-12-063921\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-13-075323\n/Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-14-085121\n\n$ sudo tmutil delete /Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-10-043920\nDeleting: /Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-10-043920\nDeleted (149.0M): /Volumes/Mac SSD TM/Backups.backupdb/g/2018-01-10-043920\nTotal deleted: 149.0M\n\n", "Q: How does macOS allow Standard users to ping I've got a pretty deep question here that I hope someone can answer.  In macOS, regular users can ping as well as root.  Normally, root access is required to open the raw socket necessary to run ping.  I've noticed on Linux that this usually accomplished by adding extended attributes to the ping program file to allow root-level access for opening raw sockets (in the past, this was done by just setting the setuid bit on the ping program, allowing it to do anything in its programming as root).\nI've looked at /sbin/ping on macOS (High Sierra, specifically), and no such attributes are set, and neither is setuid.  So what is macOS doing to allow Standard (non-root) users to ping?  Are they sending ICMP packets over TCP or UDP?  If so (or if there's another mechanism I'm just missing entirely), can you point me to some docs?  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Let's take a look at the source code for Apple's ping implementation. Notably, we see this:\nif (getuid())\n    s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_ICMP);\nelse\n    s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP);\nsockerrno = errno;\n\ngetuid returns 0 if root. So this code is saying, \"open the socket in DGRAM (datagram mode) if we are not root. If we are root, open as raw\".\nSo a raw socket is only used when you are root. An IMCP ping packet is a standard DGRAM packet and does not require raw sockets.\nHowever, there are some flags that can be passed to ping that do require root, and for those you will get an \"Operation Not Permitted\". For example:\n>ping -f\nping: -f flag: Operation not permitted\n\nWhen run as root, I do not get the operation not permitted. So Apple's implementation will let you do standard ping operations which does not require root, but require you to run as root for certain flags and operations.\nDepending on if you are root, it may set some additional socket options:\nif (uid == 0)\n    (void)setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, (char *)&hold,\n        sizeof(hold));\n\n", "Q: How can I download apps from the App Store without using Touch ID? I can no longer install any apps from the App Store to my iPhone as the only way to now do so is via Touch ID which I cannot use on my phone.

To expand on the title question...\nThere are numerous in-code methods, with varying reliability, to detect if an iOS device has been jailbroken.  However, is there any method that a device user can detect this?\nI am putting together a security information pack for users of our iOS applications. I would like to include guidance on detecting if their device is jailbroken.  Bear in mind that these users are not \"power users\", so imagine you are advising your grandma :)\n\nA: One way to do this is to see if an app called \"Cydia\" exists. If it does, the phone is jailbroken. You can search for Cydia using the search bar (Spotlight), or you can just look for it by searching through the iPhone manually. There are ways to jailbreak iPhones without including Cydia, but the likelihood that a jailbroken phone has Cydia is very high. This would be the easiest way for a casual user to detect if their iPhone has been jailbroken.\nCydia can be hidden however, as is pointed out in the comment below, so the method above isn't fool proof. The best way to PREVENT a device from being jailbroken is to keep it updated. The latest jailbreaks can be found on www.redmondpie.com and on www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/, so you'll know whether or not it is possible to jailbreak your phone. You'll find the latest jailbreaks tied to certain iOS firmwares, so if your phone is always up to date, the chance of your phone being jailbroken is almost zero.\nIf a device has been jailbroken, its complete file system can be accessed. There are file explorers that work on jailbroken devices but not on non-jailbroken devices and can be used to determine if your device is jailbroken or not. If you can explore the files on your phone with one of these file explorers, then it's jailbroken. iFunBox is one of these file explorers. Download iFunBox, which is free, plug your phone into the computer, and see if you can access the file system. If you can't, it's not jailbroken.\n", "Q: WD Passport not mounting I copied a number of Adobe Premier Pro movie files and some mixed Pro Tools files onto a WD My Passport Slim from my Mac Pro in order to work on them on vacation.

I have downloaded the latest drivers onto my flash drive, loaded up the official licensed DVD of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, but when I click \"Proceed\" after choosing \"Install Windows 7 or Windows 8\", the Boot Camp Assistant tells me \"Windows 10 is not supported. Please use a DVD or USB with Windows 7 or Windows 8\", as if my DVD has Windows 10 on it.\nI didn't alter the DVD (how could I, it's DVD-R). I've also had Windows 7 previously installed, then updated to 8, 8.1 and 10 via online updates, but after that I have totally wiped out the whole partition and joined it back to Macintosh HD, before trying to perform a fresh install.\nIs there a way to fix this and install Windows 7 from this drive?\nP.

I can connect to the disk using Back To My Mac. The disk is quite old, and I have no backup of that backup, so I'd like to at least backup the Documents folder that's on it. While I can dig into the folder structure of the backup when accessing it from Japan, I can't get to the Documents folder itself. There are several Time Machine backup instances, and from what I gather about how Time Machine works, the folders within these instances are aliased to their corresponding folders in previous instances when data hasn't changed between backups.\nMy problem is that when I click on one of these aliased folders, I get a message about the alias being broken. I can't find the actual Documents folder itself. I know it has to be there because the drive size is given as 25 GB. Unfortunately, I have nobody in New York who is competent enough to help me. The disk was previously used to backup an iMac that died. Does anybody here have any advice?\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect and mount the Time Machine volume in Finder.\n\n*Click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar.\n\n*Hold ⌥ and choose Browse Other Backup Disks….\n\n*Select your mounted Time Machine backup volume to browse its contents.\n\n", "Q: Recovering emails from defunct IMAP account I have an IMAP account within Mail.app which was recently “killed” (moved to a different provider to be precise). Unfortunately, I was not able to do a backup beforehand, because I received the admin’s notification about the upcoming infrastructure change too late.\nActually, I didn't suspect any big issue moving the messages from the mailboxes from the old to the new server (after all, Mail.app seems to be caching all messages for offline reading anyways). But this assumption was probably too simple. I made the following attempts:\n\n\n*\n\n*My old email mailboxes were still in Mail.app, but showing the 'warning' badge to indicate that the server was no longer working. So I simply set up the new email account in Mail.app and kept the old one in parallel. I tried dragging my emails from the old to the new mailboxes -- and just nothing happened.\n\n*I located the directory which contained my account’s mailboxes in the file system (~/Library/Mail/V4/SOME-UUID) and copied this as a backup. I then deleted the no-longer working email account. I used Mail.app’s import feature and was able to import all messages into a local mailbox. Yay. I then wanted to re-upload these messages to my new IMAP account and the following happened:\n\n*When dragging a mailbox’ messages (e.g. content of “Archive”) to my new IMAP account, seemingly all messages are moved to the server. But double-checking results shows: Only messages WITHOUT attachments are copied, and all my emails which had one or more files attached are simply lost (they no longer show up in the local mailbox either)\nIs there any chance to clean up this mess and get my messages back on the server?\nObservations about the backup so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*emails without attachments seem to be saved as .emlx file\n\n*in contrast, email with attachments are saved as .partial.emlx\n\nA: My solution at the end: I wrote a tool to convert the .emlx and .partial.emlx files to .eml files. I re-imported these .eml files into Mail.app and was able to upload them to my new IMAP mail account.\nIn case anyone should encounter the same challenge, here’s my converter (Node.js-based):\nhttps://github.com/qqilihq/partial-emlx-converter\n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra - Disk Utility will not let me partition an external hard drive Within disk utility, the partition icon is grayed out.  If I mouse over it, it reads:  \"Disks with Master Boot Record Partition Maps cannot be partitioned\".  The history on this drive:  It is a 2 TB Seagate external hard drive that the Mac store reformatted for me to use with Time Machine. I had a problem right after I bought my Mac and we did this to backup my machine and literally restore it to a new machine.  Since then, I have used it with time machine and now want to re-partition it so I can store backups of additional files to the other partition (once it is created).  The current single partition is \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\".  Any ideas how to address this issue?  I would prefer not to have to erase the disk as part of the process (if possible).\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In the disk utility, select 'View' and 'Show Devices'.\n\n*Select the drive (out-dented entry with the mfgr.'s ID and size) from the side list. \n\n*Click on the Erase tab in the Disk Utility toolbar.

I'm coming from my old MacBook Pro to this new system and wanted a similar keyboard and trackpad arrangment, so I got one of these \n\nI love it, BUT the trackpad is so very sensitive.  I swear it can detect my finger when it's a hair's breadth from actually touching it.  So, every time I accidentally bump it with my palm or wrist the cursor jumps while I'm typing.\nIs there a way to configure it so that it's less sensitive?  I think this is called \"palm rejection\", but I haven't found anything about how to configure the trackpad to NOT be so sensitive yet.\n\nA: I'm actually one of the 'studs' from the StUDS Collective that designed The Wedgie. The challenge you brought up is one we've wrestled with trying to find a good solution for without over-complicating the design of the tray. I use the tray daily, but don't use 'tap to click' so it's less of an issue for me, but here are a couple of low tech solutions we've come up with.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the trackpad around backwards and use the \"better touch tool\" mentioned above to invert all of the functions on the trackpad. This makes the top edge recessed enough that it avoids contact with your palm. I also regularly use this configuration for charging the trackpad without removing it from the tray.\n\n\n\n*We've also developed a little silicone bumper that helps with the problem too. This is still something we're playing with so it's not listed for sale anywhere.\n\n\nA: I don't think it's possible to enable palm rejection in software, for the Magic Trackpad.  I've been trying to find a way to do the same thing, with no luck.  I found a feature request for the Better Touch Tool (BTT), where a developer closed the ticket as not being possible — even for such a robust app:\nPoor Palm Recognition on the external Magic Trackpad 2 #1448 | BetterTouchTool | Github\nHowever, it may be possible to solve with some physical changes to the keyboard/trackpad tray. I have considered building up a small rim around the top corners and along the sides of the trackpad on the similar keyboard/trackpad tray which I use, The Wedgie (I bought my tray from an Etsy listing by the same \"StUDS\" merchant, which has since been removed; appears that they still sell it directly from their site, as I've linked to here).  I have not yet done so myself, but I think that I may be able to add a ridge of Sugru (same color as my tray), on the tray right next to where the trackpad sits, to prevent my palms from resting on the trackpad. \n\nA: You can combine a userspace multitouch callback (via MTRegisterContactFrameCallback) with a CGEventTap to block tap events. From experimentation, the poor palm rejection seems to stem at the hardware level since if you look at the finger id reported in the multitouch frame it seems to think the palm is a thumb many times. By contrast the internal trackpad correctly and consistently distinguishes these two. So I just filtered based on fingerId (I never tap with my thumb anyway) and it works to filter 95% of clicks. If you'd like you can also play around with other parameters such as size, orientation, etc. (the contact frame format is well documented, see e.g. https://gist.github.com/rmhsilva/61cc45587ed34707da34818a76476e11 for sample code on how to use that)\nYou could get fancier and consider the position as well, which is how I believe BetterTouchTools does when you enable the \"filter tap-to-click at magic trackpad edge feature.\" I'm not sure why the BTT dev said this was infeasible (as one of the other commenters linked in a github issue which has been deleted), since BTT already does have a feature to do this (the aforementioned prevent tap-to-click at the edge of the trackpad). But that's not implemented very well since it seems to apply to both the internal and external trackpads.\nYou could also extend this to pointer movement which can be similarly blocked with a cgeventtap. But the difficulty there may be in correlating between the raw trackpad event and the subsequent cgevent, which may be why the BTT dev hesitated.\nBy the way, you ever wondered how BTT is able to flip magic trackpad orientation even on 10.11 and above? It uses the MTDeviceSetSurfaceOrientation call in private multitouch framework. Amazing that I found 0 references to this on the web. After 5 years you'd think someone might have gotten curious...\n\nA: AFAICT, there's still no way to enable palm rejection on the Magic Trackpad 2. However, to build on the other workarounds, I use the Wedgie's sequel, the tré. I've added six large 3M Command picture-hanging strips to the palmrest areas.\n\nThese strips have a raised, textured surface which adds a little clearance and airflow. Despite the spiky appearance, they have a comfortably smooth feel. They stick tight, but can be removed with the little tabs on the bottom.\nIt's not the prettiest solution, and YMMV depending on your hand geometry, but it's cheap to try and has been working pretty well for me.\n", "Q: Can I Swap Out A MacBook Hard Drive For Windows I recently purchased a used 2014 MacBook with knowing it has no hard drive. However I do not care for Mac OS, the question here is can I effectively run Windows 10 on a MacBook just by installing a Windows SSD?\nIf so do I need to format anything or is it good to go.\n\nA: The SSD will need to be formatted / partioned to work with the « bios » on the macbook, after that Bootcamp will be able to allow you to run windows from a separate partition.\nI have not done this, but many do have both OSx and windows installed and working on one machine.\nCheck out Bootcamp : https://support.apple.com/boot-camp.\nEdit : macs don’t have « bios »  (only used that term as it is easily understood by those coming from the pc world...) instead there is a bootrom process to get to the desktop from pressing the on button, this link gives a reasonable explanation of that process which checks ram, the self tests and runs the efi to get to the desktop.

I use ^ Control⇧ Shift\n⌘ Command4 first, then I paste it into Mail, when I double click the image that I pasted, it is TIFF format.\nI try to change the screenshot format to PNG; it works. But when I change back to JPG or BMP, both of them will be saved as TIFF format.\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg\n\nHow can I save it as JPG format?\n\nA: It Has to do with the Clipboard; not Screen Capture\nScreen capture can obviously support more than these two file formats; obviously it supports GIF and JPEG/JPG, but it also supports PDF.  However, the issue here isn't what Screen Capture is capable of handling, it what your clipboard is capable of. Why?  Well, you're going directly from your clipboard to pasting an inline image into a mail message.  Once Screen Capture \"hands over\" bitmap to the clipboard, it's work is done.\nNow, your clipboard stores images as a RAW format so it can preserve every single detail.  How it gets saved (when Screen Capture writes it to disk), the clipboard simply doesn't care if you use a high quality format like PNG or TIFF or a lossy format like JPEG or PDF; basically, you chose it, you'll get it.\nBut why PNG or TIFF?\nThe very short answer is both are image formats that support lossless compression.  In other words, they can make the images much smaller than their RAW format without losing an ounce of quality.\nApple chose PNG as it's default and I can only speculate as to why...\n\n*\n\n*PNG (Portable Network Graphic) was to be a replacement for the GIF format\n\n*It's web friendly\n\n*It was designed for transferring images over the network/Internet\n\nTIFF on the other hand...\n\n*\n\n*Acquired by Adobe in 1996 for desktop publishing\n\n*It was an attempt to standardize scanned (and faxed) documents into a single high quality file format\n\n*Built in support for meta data\n\n*Could hold multiple pages as a single document like a PDF\n\nWhy you get TIFF when pasting to your App\nComing out of the clipboard, you've got two ways to go - PNG or TIFF.  Since you specifically told screen capture you didn't want PNG, it went to the only other choice available - TIFF.\n\n\nHow can I save it as JPG format?\n\n\nDon't use your clipboard.  Save to your Desktop (or other location) and just manually convert to JPEG.  Then drag your item over to the app you're using.  If you do this through the Preview App, you will have the opportunity to set the quality/size of your JPEG in case it's still too large for some receiving email systems.  (Preview) File → Export → Format\n\nIf this is something you do quite a bit, you can easily create an Automator action...but that's another question for another time.\n\nA: MacOS uses TIFF as the file format for image data coming out of the Pasteboard.\nYou can't store an image on the clipboard as a JPEG, unless an app deliberately specifies it, and if you query the Pasteboard Manager for available types, after sending a screenshot to the clipboard, you get:\n(\n    \"public.tiff\",\n    \"NeXT TIFF v4.0 pasteboard type\"\n)\n\nTo avoid a TIFF image, use a method that doesn't involve the clipboard: create the screenshot file using Command Shift 4, and drag the screenshot file directly into the email window, or click on the 'paper-clip' icon, and select it from the file dialog.\n\nA: I am in the same boat, why does saving to the clipboard make it a .TIFF. I took two screenshots and it is larger than i can send in an email. .jpg please, when did this start happening? I used Terminal and OnyX with the same result.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro file sharing stops working OS X El Capitan - 10.11.6\nMBP Mid 2015\nI have file sharing setup to a folder on an external drive.  I use the sharing via VLC on my phone or on a fire stick.  \nThe most recent example was watching a movie for more than an hour, pausing and coming back less than 5 minutes later and not being able to continue watching.  Confirming on the phone the file sharing seemed to be no longer working.  Going back to the laptop and turning sharing off and back on resolved the problem.  \nThe laptop is connected to a power adapter and the power settings in adapter mode prevent the computer from sleeping automatically when display is off and the put hard drives to sleep when possible is not checked.\nI had noticed that if the filesharing is working properly and I come back to the laptop and unclick filesharing, osx will come up with a dialog that says users are still connected to the sharing, would you like to end sharing in x minutes.  If I come back and the sharing is not working and unclick the sharing it doesn't give this warning.  Sometimes the problem is the firestick as I can see the sharing working on the phone but sometimes the problem is osx as the sharing has stopped working for both.  I am not too surprised the firestick stuff is a little unstable but the problems with osx and sharing surprise me.\nAny thoughts as to what causes this?\n\nA: The following might be one of the issues but it hasn't fixed the issue for me so I'll continue to look for a solution.  Opening preferences, sharing and enabling and disabling sharing causes the sharing to start working again so possibly I just need a cron job that runs every so often and does whatever the gui is doing in the background.  The other possible hint is that my monitors are typically asleep so I might test around disabling the \"turn display off after\" or \"automatic graphics switching\" features.\nThe OSX powernap feature and SMB don't like each other.  I've quoted and pasted the link below describing the problem.  The answer is also apple recommended so that leads credence to it.\n\n“Enable Power Nap” selected in the Energy Saver settings was forcing the network drives to dismount. I disabled that setting two days ago, and the network backups have properly worked the past two nights; the network drives also remain mounted as I can see when I come into the office in the morning. This behavior is counterintuitive given that the entire point of a Power Nap is to permit the computer to perform network based operations as per Apple’s own words:\n“While sleeping, your Mac can back ip using Time Machine and periodically check for new email, calendar, and other iCloud updates”\nYet, this very same feature causes network drives to dismount once the Mac goes to sleep.  As I stated in the original post, this appears to be a longstanding problem that needs to be corrected in macOS, as many Mac users, particularly those in work environments, need to connect to servers, NAS, etc. that are not set up with Mac-centric protocols.\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7842881\nI'll update once I've had a chance to test out disabling the other energy features and see that I don't encounter any more issues with the file sharing.\n", "Q: I'm trying to peek my old backups I have an iPhone 5s, I have had this phone since 2014. It is pretty beaten up... But it still works. My question is;\nIf I accidentally restore an older back up on my phone, will I be able to go back into iTunes and restore the most recent back up to get all my current information back on my phone?\n\nA: Yes, if you have a more recent backup you can always restore that later.\n", "Q: What is /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port and /dev/cu.iPhone-WirelessiAP So I was flashing my ESP8266 using Arduino and when selecting  the port for flashing I saw this:\n\nI don't know what the red highlighted ports mean? What are they? And what happens if I flash them?\n\nA: They are virtual serial ports matching paired/connected Bluetooth devices. For example \"iPhone-WireeiAP\" refers to tethering your computer to your iPhone to use its internet connection from your Mac. This can be implemented via a virtual serial port served over Bluetooth - however, it is obviously not done from your Arduino flashing tool.\nThe menu just lists any serial port found on your system - it does not indicate that they can be flashed. For example you cannot flash your iPhone this way.\nIf you try and flash them anyways, most probably nothing will happen at all. You will risk that while flashing you're sending something that the remove device (could be anything really) interprets as a correct command. Then you could risk for example altering settings on the device, or any other type of facility offered through the virtual serial port. Most likely everything will just be rejected as invalid commands though.\n", "Q: How to Mount a Sparsebundle Disk Image from Time Machine Backup? I have several sparse bundle disk images on my system, used for various purposes (mostly to prevent Time Machine from backing up the entirety of very large files).\nHowever, I'm planning to restructure my storage in the near future, and will likely be eliminating the use of these disk images.\nWhat I'd like to be able to do is mount a sparse bundle that's located on my Time Machine backup drive, so that I can copy data from inside it into its new location, without having to copy the disk image first (requiring double the storage).\nThe problem is, none of my backed up sparse bundle images can be mounted from a Time Machine volume, all I get is a \"no mountable filesystems\" error. Assuming the issue is that Time Machine volumes are effectively read-only, I tried the following command instead:\nhdiutil attach /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/MachineName/Latest/Path/To/Image.sparsebundle -readonly\n\nHowever this doesn't work either, producing the same error.\nNow, I'm fairly certain this is an issue specific to mounting sparse bundles from a Time Machine backup, as I'm sure the images themselves are fully intact (I've shasumed all the contents and compared to the source).\nIs there a way that I can mount a sparse bundle from a Time Machine backup, without having to copy it in its entirety to somewhere else first?\nTo be clear, and to disambiguate from similar questions; the disk images I'm referring to are inside my Time Machine backup, they are not the Time Machine backup itself, i.e- I'm backing up to a directly attached drive, not a network disk.\nUPDATE: So I had an idea of my own, which was to create a hard-linked copy of the image outside of the Backups.backupdb folder, thinking perhaps that that may be mountable without issues, but this doesn't appear to be possible either. Running gcp -lr to do this results in stat giving a \"permission denied\" error, so presumably Time Machine backups also resist stating of files for some reason.\n\nA: If you are ok with creating a temporary shadow file, you can mount it this way:\nhdiutil attach -shadow /path/to/store/the/temporary/file.shadow /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/MachineName/Latest/Path/To/Image.sparsebundle\n\nFor succinctness, that is: hdiutil attach -shadow <shadowfile> <imagefile>\nEdit: in a previous version of my answer I included the -readonly flag in the command, but I've found that it will sometimes fail with \"no mountable file systems\" when -readonly is passed. Omitting the flag in these cases allowed the image to be mounted successfully.\nAs such, I've updated the answer to exclude the -readonly flag. Just note that any changes you make in rw mode will only be written to the shadow file.\n", "Q: Altering or touching a file does not always update the parent directory modification time? I've got two source code directories (different programming languages) and I've noticed that when I alter source files in language A the direct parent modification time also updates. However, in language B, altering sources does not seem to update the parent directory modification times whatsoever. \nHonestly, this feels quite weird to me and I can't find a pattern or reason for this. Is this something related to MacOS only? I don't recall every seeing this behaviour in Linux systems.\nCan the files have some kind of attribute which tells the OS how to update the parent directories?\nI'm on High Sierra using a zsh shell.\n\nA: Your observations seem to be off. In this respect macOS works the same as Linux - the modification time for the parent directory change when you add, remove or rename files/subdirectories in that directory.\nThe modification time is not changed when you alter the contents of files. Neither on macOS nor on Linux.\n", "Q: 'Wallet and Apple Pay' missing from Macbook Pro settings I have macbook following version.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014), OS: Mac OS Sierra 10.13.2 (17C88)\nI am using the following link to setup Apple pay for Mac.\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-set-and-manage-apple-pay-mac\nBut i can't see the option of 'Wallet and Apple Pay' in the System Preference.\n\nA: Only MacBook Pro with Touch ID have a ‘Wallet and Apple Pay’ preference pane, as these Macs are the only ones which have the necessary hardware support for storing cards for Apple Pay on device.\nOn older Macs, Apple Pay is still supported with a compatible iPhone. No configuration is available on the Mac, since the Mac delegates to the iPhone for Apple Pay.\nTo enable Apple Pay on your Mac using your iPhone, go to Settings → Wallet & Apple Pay and turn on ‘Allow Payments on Mac’.\n", "Q: How to select power direction over USB-C I have a USB battery which has a USB-C port on it.\nWhen I connect it to my MacBook Pro (regardless of whether the MacBook Pro is running off its battery or via the mains), the Mac doesn't charge the battery, but instead uses the battery to power the Mac.\nIf the Mac is not on its own power supply, it will use the USB battery for charging (very slowly, but useful in a pinch).\nIn every case, the Mac tries to make power flow from the battery to the computer.\nHow do I reverse this? How do I make power flow from the Mac to the battery?\nApparently this is selectable, and other OSs provide an option.\n\nA: \nIn every case, the Mac tries to make power flow from the battery to the computer.\nHow do I reverse this? How do I make power flow from the Mac to the\nbattery?\n\nI believe @amdyes gave a workable answer with a mention of using two USB-C to USB-A adapters/cables back to back. The device with the cable having a male USB-A female receptacle will only source power.  The device with the USB-A male plug will only sink power.  Flipping the cable around will reverse the flow of power.  This forces a flip in the roles that each device will go into regardless of how they negotiate power transfer.\nApple uses USB-BC, USB-PD, and it's own BrickId for communication between USB power sources and sinks.  USB-BC allows for power transfer up to 7.5 watts, and always in one direction.  USB-BC and BrickId were developed to allow for simple power bricks to charge devices.  There's no defined method for USB-BC and BrickId to reverse power flow when both devices are able to source and sink power.\nUSB-PD allows for power transfer up to 100 watts, and switch direction of that power transfer.  While USB-PD can manage power transfer between 7.5 watts and 18 watts it is expensive to do so.  Expensive not just in dollars but also in the volume it would take for the electronics inside small devices, and expensive in the power consumed by the electronics needed to communicate by USB-PD.\nApple filled this gap between USB-BC and USB-PD with BrickId and uses it on their 12 watt power supplies.  Older Apple USB-A power bricks rated for 10 watts (and likely any other power brick rated between 5 and 18 watts that may exist) used what is now a deprecated version of USB-BC and/or BrickId.\nI'll see people complain that Apple is \"doing their own thing\" with BrickId, and therefore violating some USB specification.  Since Apple is a member of the group that writes the USB spec, and enforces compliance to the spec, makes it unlikely that they are violating any USB spec.  There's plenty of other electronics manufacturers \"doing their own thing\", which may or may not violate the USB specs.\nQualcomm saw the same gap between USB-BC and USB-PD that Apple did, but they filled this with their Quick Charge protocol.  Quick Charge 4 is something of an umbrella specification which combines parts of USB-BC, USB-PD, and prior versions of Quick Charge along with a few new features.  This is Qualcomm and friends \"doing their own thing\" but at least attempting to not step into where it might violate the USB specs.\nThere's other means of getting power into and out of a USB battery pack but what Apple and Qualcomm are doing have been the most popular.  There's a lot of overlap in what Apple, Qualcomm, and others will do to maintain compatibility with as many USB devices as possible and therefore keep customers happy.  What still happens though is that manufacturers will have to choose one out of the two or more options on how to solve a problem, because implementing all of them will be expensive or simply impossible.\nQuick Charge and BrickId both use the data pins on a USB-A port to communicate the capabilities of a power source to a power sink.  I suspect that your power pack is using one means to communicate, the MacBook is using another, and so nothing is communicated.\nI went into some detail here to hopefully help people know what to look for in finding the problem, as well as describe why the problem even exists.  This might not bring a solution but should give guidance on repeating the problem.  The term \"BrickId\" is not likely to be found in any documentation as this is a term not meant for public consumption.  Quick Charge and many other trademarks used to describe battery charging methods over USB are meant for public consumption.  Searching the documentation for these terms should help in seeing where the problem might be.\nI will admit my desire to go into some of this detail is a bit of a rant against complaints of some manufacturer \"doing their own thing\".  That's what happens when two companies find the same problem, at the same time, and don't know the other is working on a solution.  This sucks for us consumers to have to look for conflicts in standards but I can imagine far worse things to deal with.\n\nA: Method 1: Reverse/inverse the sides/plugs of the USB-C to USB-C cable. Might works or not.\nMethod 2.1: Use a USB-C to micro-USB(male) cable and a micro-USB(female) to USB-C(male) adapter.\nMethod 2.2: Use a USB-C to USB-A(female) adapter and a USB-A to USB-C cable.\nMethod 2 should always work. However you cannot use PD charge then.\nExplain for method 1: I've heard C-C cables have sides to determine host / device. But I can't find the source. From my personal experiment, it depends on cables.\n\nA: Electrical current will always flow from a higher voltage to lower. Batteries in USB battery packs have regulated output voltage in which the batteries when charged is slightly higher than 5V and regulated down to 5V to ensure a constant output voltage is maintained even when the battery is close to empty. Hence current flow normally would flow from battery pack to laptop. Some battery packs have a separate charging plug/ circuit to charge the battery this plug supplies a higher voltage than the battery until it’s fully charged voltage is reached. All rechargeable batteries have a higher voltage when charged and a lower voltage when discharged. Battery packs without a separate charging port, can switch from discharging mode to charging mode (with a booster circuit in order to charge the battery pack which has a higher charge voltage) if it detects the usb PD circuit has a slightly higher voltage than its regulator is producing ... indicating an alternative power supply.\n", "Q: How to launch system's \"Network diagnostics\" from the command line I would like to launch \"Network diagnostics\" from the command line.\n\nA: High Sierra and newer OS have moved this to the Applications folder in CoreServices.

It just displays the telephone number (including country code). \nStrangely, if I go into contacts and manually edit the number so that it is the country code (e.g. +44, rather just '0'), it then displays correctly with the name. However, ideally I would like not to have to edit all of my contact numbers to include the country code. Another strange behaviour is that for contacts where I have their photo, it displays the photo next to their telephone number, so it is recognising the number as belonging to that particular contact, it is just now showing the contact name. \nThis issue has only occurred recently after I signed out of iCloud on my MacBook Pro and then signed back in.\nDoes anyone know how I might be able to resolve this?\nKind regards,\nRussell\n\nA: The problem seems to be that the phone numbers in your contacts have lost the proper format. They should be in the form (123) 456-7890 and they have been formatted as 1234567890.  It seems that iOS does a really literal comparison and it can't resolve this difference.\nI fixed this on my iPhone 5s running iOS 12 by changing my region from the US to Canada. That evidently forces a re-formatting of the erroneous numbers. Then I changed it back to the US. Note that my contacts were synced with Google/Gmail. I think this should also work for iCloud, but your mileage may vary.\nGo to Settings app → General → Language & Region → Region, tap on Canada, then tap Done. (I bet selecting any different region would work). The change takes a bit of a time. When it is complete, look at your recent calls, voicemails and messages - they should be displaying names. Look at your contacts - phone numbers should be correctly formatted. If so, the problem should be fixed. In any case, change the region back to United States.\n", "Q: How to delete an old Apple ID on iPhone For a short time, I'm reverting back to my old iPhone.\nI entered my current Apple ID (the one with email address). A long time ago, Apple ID wasn't an email address.\nThe pop-up \"Sign in to iTunes Store\" keeps showing. How can one delete the old Apple ID (not an email address) without resetting?\n\nA: I’m not sure what you mean by resetting but if you go to https://appleid.apple.com/ from a computer you can manage Apple ID’s. \nAlso here’s a link to an Apple discussion group with similar issue. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5362309?language=en\nHope this helped. \n", "Q: rsync -a not preserving file ownership or group I'm rsyncing from a remote linux box to my local solid state hard drive on my mac running High Sierra.

Using disk utility, I see Owners is set to enabled.\nI seem to remember being able to do this and the files would be saved with the UID and GID numbers.\nIs this still possible?\n\nA: I encountered the same problem and found a solution that worked for me.

The problem is when I try to call open with a URL:\nopen -a \"Firefox Full Screen\" \"https://google.com\"\n\nThis still opens Firefox, with the given URL in a new tab, but it doesn't execute the lines after delay 0.8, so it doesn't open in full screen. I don't understand why this happens and how to fix it.\nI know those lines are not executed because the system doesn't warn that I need to add the application as an accessibility exception (when I don't have one added/enabled).

It is fairly trivial on a computer where you can edit HOSTS file. As this is not possible on iPad I tried to replace DNS with public Google DNS. To my surprise outgoing DNS requests are also blocked.\nIs there any way to \"emulate\" HOSTS file functionality on iPad where IP is resolved locally without outgoing DNS request? Perhaps some browsers can do that?\nP.S. Using proxy or running local DNS is not an option.\n\nA: The easiest way to solve this is probably to use an app such as \"Weblock - AdBlock for iOS\" that works through proxying content. In the app you create a redirect rule for your external web site URL and to the correct IP address of the website (port number 80 for http or 443 for https).\nAnother possibility is using a VPN app to allow you to punch through and access other DNS servers.\n", "Q: How to make the last network user username remain in the login field? I have joined (bound) a MacBook Pro to a Windows Active Directory environment. I've set it to prompt for name and password, rather than show a picture, being the network user is not a local user, and this is fine. However, I'd like it if the \"Name\" field remembered the last logged in user, rather than requiring both username and password to be entered each time.\nIncidentally, sometimes when I start typing the username in the MacBook says \"Network accounts are unavailable\", for only a second - I guess while it is starting up WiFi? It makes me worry there is no equivalent of a \"cached\" user credential in OS X ... will the user be able to login when, say, on a plane?\nI've never used a Mac joined to a Windows domain before.\nThanks, kindly.\n\nA: Ok! I have learned something. I will leave this here in hope it helps others who experience the same issue.\nWhen setting up the AD binding there was an option about \"create mobile account at login\" which I left off. I assumed it was like a Windows roaming user.\nHowever, it seems if you don't turn this on, OS X won't create a home directory for the user, or a local account for them.\nWhen you turn it on, and login again, it does. Having the home directory/local account means you can turn the icon login option back on (so they don't need to enter the username), it means you can make them an admin of the machine, it means they can login when offline, and various other things.\nSo, turning this on has essentially solved a number of puzzling and frustrating things.\n", "Q: Is Magic Trackpad feature-equivalent with built-in MacBook touchpads/trackpads? TLDR; for testing touchpad interface on a MacBook, would a desktop with Magic Trackpad be suitable?\n\nWe are developing a cross-platform application Win/Mac and though we develop mostly on Windows, MacBook users are a key demographic, specifically this raises issues with trackpad functionality.\nNone of us have MacBooks but I have a MacMini so I can test the Mac build - but only with a mouse. I wondered if getting a TrackPad would let me test gestures a)work as planned b)are user friendly in a realistic way. If so, which version would be adequate?\n\nA: Yes, the Magic Trackpad or Magic Trackpad 2 should allow you to test gestures and work out if they're user friendly.\nThe only problem I can see is if you have very odd gestures or use of the track pad that relies on the specific physical size of the trackpad (which is normally not the case). The size of the trackpad varies from Mac to Mac (i.e. older models typically have smaller trackpads).\n", "Q: iPhone X photo preview different from result I would like to know if the camera behavior I am experiencing it's normal or if there is a problem.\nWhen I shoot a photo in low light conditions the photo \"preview\" I see in the camera app is really different from the final photo.\nThis is before taking the photo. As you can see there is some noise in the picture:\n\nThis is the result taken from the camera roll. The noise is not present anymore and light is totally different:\n\nHow it is supposed to work? Because if the preview it's different from the result I cannot trust the preview and maybe I can do some adjustment before shooting (e.g. change the exposure) that will led to a completely unexpected result.\n\nA: The final photo is not a “screenshot”-esque result, but a processed image.\n", "Q: How to deep link to Notes app? With other apps, like twitter, for example, you could simply use twitter://xxxxx to link to it, but how do you do the same with the Notes app? \nThanks\n\nA: The URL scheme for the Notes app is mobilenotes://\nSource:\nhttps://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/always-updated-list-ios-app-url-scheme-names-0184033/\n\nA: The answer is different on macOS and iOS.\nOn macOS, the URL scheme is notes://showNote?identifier=???; on iOS, it is similar, but uses a different scheme: mobilenotes://showNote?identifier=???.\nThe ??? here is annoying and subtle to get out.  It is not accessible via AppleScript on the mac, even though AppleScript can see an \"id\", that is an unrelated value.  You need to use the Shortcuts app and the \"view content graph\" action on the note that you want to extract the URL from, double click the \"note\" in the graph, then the \"INNote\" (on iOS<15/macOS<ventura) or \"LNNote\" (on iOS>=16/macOS>=Ventura), then fish a UUID out of the gibberish you see in the text field there.\nOn iOS 16 / macOS Ventura, the format changed subtly, and it is now case sensitive, as well as opposite from the case shown in the content graph.   Federico Viticci discovered this change and documented it in a blog post late last year.\n\nA: I just got this to work.\nI opened iCloud Notes in a browser on my Mac.\nI navigated to the specific note that I wanted.\nI copied the URL.\nI have clipboard sharing enabled between my Mac and my iPhone. (Explaining that setup is off topic for this question.)\nI opened Chrome on my iPhone, iOS 15.1.\nI pasted in the copied http:// URL into the Chrome address bar.\nI changed the http:// to mobilenotes:// and clicked Go.\nChrome attempted to search for the entire URL string.\nI copied the changed URL string.\nI opened Safari on my iPhone.\nI pasted in the copied mobilenotes:// URL into the Safari address bar and clicked Go.\nSafari asked me if I wanted to open the note in the Notes app.\nI said Yes.\nNotes opened, on that specific note, a couple of layers deep in my Notes hierarchy.\n", "Q: Detecting Potential MacBook Pro Hardware Damage I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and my sister was angry for some reason when using it.

Luckily there\n  was none! Running a hardware test returned No Issues found, but I was\n  still not satisfied, hence my post.\nQuestion: Should I worry about hardware damage at this point?\n\nIf it looks good, it is good.\nYour early 2015 MacBook Pro has virtually no moving parts save the fan, hinges and keyboard.  Everything is is solid state.\n\nThis means that if your MacBook Pro looks undamaged, hinges and keyboard work then your MacBook Pro is fine.  If the fan was damaged, you would get an error.  If anything on the logic board was broken/damaged, you would know immediately as you would be getting errors/failures.\n", "Q: What will occur if the .DocumentRevisions-V100 folder is deleted? This post concerns the folder located at the following file path:\n/.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nI right-clicked this folder in Finder.app and selected Get Info. After several minutes of waiting, the \"Size\" field still stated, \"Calculating size.\"\nSo, I ran the following command in Terminal.app to get this folder's file size:\nsudo du -sh /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nThis informed me that this folder takes up 70 GB on my rMBP.\nAfter searching online, I learned that this folder is said to contain automatic back-up versions of files. However, I do not know how this works, exactly. My understanding is that once a window is closed or an application is Quit, then one can no longer click Undo to revert to previously saved states.\nSo, my first question is, how does one actually access these file back-ups? For example, when I pull up an old .rtf file in TextEdit.app, I see no option to \"Revert to a previously saved version of this document.\"\nIn my view, 70 GB is a significant amount of space. I would like to clear up this space on my Macintosh HD. I recognize that one should delete system files with caution.

I do not see its purpose or value.\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\n\nA: Just because one cannot see something's purpose or value doesn't mean there isn't one!\nIf you delete the /.DocumentRevisions-V100 directory it will break the Document Revisions feature in OS X until you reboot. At which point the /.DocumentRevisions-V100 directory is recreated.\nSomewhere along the way the Document Revisions feature changed, i.e. it's not the same in OS X 10.11 as it is in OS X 10.8, e.g. in OS X 10.8 in TextEdit I can click the down arrow to the right of the filename in the title bar of the document and select Browse All Versions..., and it opens the Time Machine interface when I can view the various versions of the document that are stored within the /.DocumentRevisions-V100 directory. This is not the case in OS X 10.11. I'm not sure when this feature changed to have less importance then it used to have in e.g. OS X 10.8.\nIn OS X 10.11, if you delete the /.DocumentRevisions-V100 directory, without rebooting, and create a new document in TextEdit and save it, then reopen and edit it, then click the close button... you'll get the a dialog box, \"Do you want to save the changes made to the document You can revert to undo the changes since you last opened the document.\" and if you click the Revert Changes button, it errors out with \"The operation couldn’t be completed. No such file or directory\" until you reboot.\nNote: This assumes you have Ask to keep changes when closing documents checked in General under System Preferences.\n\nIf you want to clean up what's in the /.DocumentRevisions-V100 directory, then close all applications except for Terminal, and use the following command:\nsudo rm -rf /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nThen reboot.\nNOTE: Make sure you have a proper Time Machine Backup and be very careful using the above command, make sure it is properly formed and there is no space between / and .DocumentRevisions-V100!

I accidentally turned off FileVault on my MacBook when trying to allow downloaded Canon driver software to be opened. FileVault is currently decrypting and I want to stop it as soon as possible. How do I stop FileVault decryption?\n\nA: You have to let it finish FileVault decryption entirely before you can turn it back on. This can take hours or sometimes days, so you'll have to be patient. Encryption also takes nearly as long. There's nothing to do but wait for it to complete.\nIf you have a MacBook, be sure to keep it plugged in, as FileVault wont decrypt or encrypt while on battery power.\nYou should still be able to use your computer while it decrypts/encrypts.\n\nA: You have to wait but you can still use your mac while you wait.\n", "Q: How to kill Google Drive File Stream process in OSX How to kill Google Drive File Stream process in OSX?\nUsing sudo kill -9 <PID>, the process appears to keep itself alive.

The sound card controls all audio, not just the speakers.  \nI see two possibilities(off the top of my head):\n\n\n*\n\n*Your left speaker is damaged.\n\n*Your headphone jack has something in it that's causing electrical problems, or has a damaged connector.  Make sure there's no debris jammed in there or other damage.\n\n\nAlso, electrical feedback from the bad speaker (if that's the case) could cause the behavior you saw with the right speaker.  Again, I don't see this being an sound card issue at all.\nHonestly, I would take it in and let Apple have a look at it.  If it is hardware issue, they can repair it.  If it's something in the software, they may have a solution.\n\nA: Ok, just stuck a tooth pick into the headphone jack and 'Internal speakers' is accessible again.\nInteresting, when it did change back both speakers where playing in stereo and at full volume (like the old days).\nThen, macbook just crashed and restarted.\nHaving gone back into \"Audio MIDI steup' it had gone back to mono signals. So, panned to the left is actually left 'mono coming out of both speakers', panned right is right mono coming out of right speaker only (not both like left).\nStrange, its either 'Digital Optical' issues in the headphone jack, OR, its an update problem in High Sierra (im using late 2011 pro).\n", "Q: Microsoft Arc Touch mouse doesn't want to connect in MacOS High Sierra I've been able to pair a Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse Surface with my MacBook ever since Yosemite, but when I updated to High Sierra the mouse stop connecting.

Their power use is directly proportional to disk activity. While they often do have extra low power modes, you won’t actually benefit much from it since it is not much less than its normal power regulation.\nThe reason this is plural is because it can also apply to external disks, and desktop macs used to have space for up to six harddisks. The 2009 Mac Pro has 4, for example.\n\nA: I'm not a 100% professional with hard drives, but here is what I would think some of the disadvantages and advantages are.\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Like you said, an advantage is the disk life might be extended. Though this extra amount of life might not be that noticeable.\n\n*Battery life - The hard drive obviously uses electricity to power it. If the hard drive is put to sleep it will turn off, thus not using any electricity which will help the battery last a bit longer.\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Longer wake time - When the computer goes to sleep the hard drive will completely stop, so when the time comes to wake the computer the hard drive will need to spin up. There will also be a delay whenever the hard drive needs to spin up after it's been put to sleep.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You don't have to worry about that setting. Apple in their infinite wisdom have decided that it should have no effect. Whether you enable or disable it, it will put your disks to sleep. At least on High Sierra.\nWhy they've chosen to keep the setting around is anyone's guess. Maybe it's bug — these days that seems very likely ;)\nEDIT: As for how I know this, it's based on me trying the setting out on High Sierra to prevent 10 attached USB drives from spinning down, and confirming that the setting does not have any effect.\n", "Q: Why are hanged windows deminimizable but not minimizable? I see that whenever an app like Mac Chrome hangs, the app will show a spinner and stop responding. So that's the same behavior as for Windows, butI've realized an oddity for Mac:\nWhy is it that the hanged Mac windows can still be moved around and deminimized, yet can't be minimized or closed?\nIs there a technical reason/rationale/explanation for this odd behavior?\n\nA: There's no technical \"law\" that requires any of this to be one way or the other, so it all boils down to how the macOS developers chose to build the system. Therefore any rationale or explanation can only be explained by that source - anything else is speculation.\nHowever, I will try to speculate why macOS behaves this way!\nTo understand the logic, you need to understand how macOS graphical programs work. Much similar to Windows, each running application has what is called an \"event loop\".\nBasically the parts of the operating system responsible for creating the graphical user interface communicates with the each running application by the way of sending messages (\"events\") to application. Applications works by continually reading these messages from a queue in what is known as an event loop.\nMessages could be things like \"The user moved the mouse\", \"The user clicked button X\", \"The user wants to close window Y\", and so on.\nWhen the graphical user interface for a running application hangs, and you get the spinner, this really just means that the application has stopped processing these events. It might have stopped doing so because it has crashed, it is stuck in a infinite loop, or because it is really busy doing something else (that might be fully productive).\nThe operating system really has no way of telling whether the application is not responding because it has failed, because it is busy with doing stuff, or because the computer is slow. The only heuristics they have is to time it - if too long time has passed, we display the spinner.\nNow you could argue that the OS could just close the program, but you might loose valuable data. If you know the program is busy doing something for you, you could wait a few seconds or whatever - the program is back processing events, and you can save your data. \nThat is most probably why it is left up to the user to decide when \"enough is enough\", and you want to terminate the program.\nNow these events that are processed by program will in modern terms often be processed by delegates. For your question it revolves around the NSWindowDelegate, which basically handles various things that can happen to a window. Note that a window is not the application on macOS - closing the window only closes that window, not the whole program.\nIf you look at NSWindowDelegate:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindowdelegate/1419461-windowwillminiaturize\nyou'll find that programs can respond to events such as \"windowWillMiniaturize\" (i.e. the user has requested that this window should minimize) and \"windowShouldClose\" (i.e. the user has requested that this window should close). The program might do something important when it receives these events - something important it needs to do before it is actually closed or minimized.\nBut what happens when the program isn't processing these events? - The system simply has to stall these operations to ensure that the program gets a chance to react to the events before things happen. Therefore you cannot minimize and close windows while the spinner is visible.\nHowever, note that the delegate doesn't contain a \"windowWillDeminiaturize\" - only \"windowDidDeminiaturize\". Therefore macOS doesn't have to stall de-minimizing a window, as it has no obligation to tell the program before it de-minimizes a window. It only has to tell it afterwards!\n", "Q: Can I disable mounting of network volumes via afp:// protocol in favor of smb:// I have a Drobo network file server which insists on offering it's mounts via both afp:// and smb://. Is there any way to force my Macs (they are all running High Sierra) to NEVER mount network volumes via AFP?\nThere is no way in the Drobo administration to disable AFP. I've talked Drobo Support: it's a \"feature we're considering.\"\nTo be clear: I understand how to mount it via SMB. There are certain situations (that I seem to be unable to control) where the macs sometimes automount via AFP. I think it might have to do with remembered \"open recent\" files -- but I'm guessing. So I want to break/disable AFP entirely. I'll take a failure to mount, instead of the problems I get when it automounts with AFP. (files don't save, apps and the finder lock up, etc)\n\nA: Two options that may be helpful in your case:\n• Close access to TCP port 548 - that should disallow any AFP access.\n• Volumes formatted as APFS can't offer share points over the network using AFP.

I'm trying to install macOS and iTunes updates via the app store, and come across a screen like this (normal):\n\nNothing to worry about, right? Then I click \"Update All\" like I usually do, and it just turns gray, and the other 2 things inside don't become gray:\n\nI then click on the individual \"Update\" buttons and they gray out similarly:\n\nIt just stays like this - I've tried leaving it for days even, and it just doesn't work.\nAnyone ever face this issue before and know how to fix it? Thanks!\n\nA: Muhammed,\nI've seen the first part of that behavior before with updates, and while not exactly intuitive, it is normal. macOS is typically downloading and installing in the background, and the update screen won't respond until that is done.\nHowever, you said you left it running for days.  That doesn't sound so normal.  I'm going to presume you have some sort of high-speed Internet connection (at least 10Mb/sec), and if that's the case, it's probably not your Internet connection.\nHowever, If you want to see the progress of the download (if there's one going at all), look at the \"LaunchPad\" icon on your Dock.  It will display progress bar below it when something is downloading and installing.\n\nIf there really is nothing happening, try logging out of the App Store and back in.  To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store\n\n*Click on the Store menu\n\n*Click \"Sign Out\"\n\n*On the Store menu again, click \"Sign In...\" and sign back in\n\n\n\n\nThat will probably do it for you, but give it a try and see.\n", "Q: Lock without going to sleep Whenever I lock my screen (using command+control+Q), the display goes to sleep within about 5 seconds. How can I prevent this?\nThis happens while plugged in, and my screen is set to never go to sleep while on power:\n\nEven if I wasn't plugged in, on battery life, the screen should go to sleep within 2 minutes, not 5 seconds:\n\nI'm on High Sierra 10.13.2.\nedit: I gave up on locking with cmd+ctrl+q and just went with enabling my screen saver and setting the system to require a password on screen saver wake.\n\nA: Alec,\nYou're running up against built-in functionality:  once the \"unlock\" screen appears and you don't enter your password, macOS falls back on the screen saver, or (without a screen saver) goes off.  Or, as you've noticed, when you use cmd+ctrl+q, it just goes to sleep, screen saver or no.  There's no control to change that behavior in the OS.\nHowever, there are some free utilities on the Internet and the App store (Caffeine and Anti Sleep come to mind, but there are others) which disable the display sleep and/or the system sleep.  I gave Anti Sleep a try with the keyboard shortcut, and it did just what you're looking to accomplish: it kept the screen \"awake\" after it was locked.\nEdit:  It looks like cmd+ctrl+q and Anti-Sleep's first option, \"Prevent System Sleep when lid is closed\" don't play together too well.  Uncheck that option to make this work.\nAll that said, be aware that the sleep feature is built-in to reduce power consumption and extend the life of your display.  By leaving the screen powered on all the time, you negate these protections. \n", "Q: Is a Sparse Bundle image or Sparse Image better for many files 3 TB external hard drive 4TB?

The data will not be edited, it should only be used for consumption.\nare there users here who tested it, how was it? was it fast? were there problems?\n\nA: It sounds like you are making a bootable image. In that case, you'll want to use one of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*Super Duper\nIf those satisfy your needs, you can stop reading. If not, read on!\nIf you are simply storing a lot of Mac files and you want to do it using a Mac-native filesystem, you should use a sparse bundle. The man page for hdiutil helps explain this:\n\nAs of Mac OS X 10.5, a more reliable, efficient, and scalable sparse\n  format, UDSB (SPARSEBUNDLE), is recommended for persistent sparse\n  images as long as a backing bundle (directory) is acceptable.\n\nTake note of that \"backing bundle\" statement -- it means that the file system on which your sparse bundle is stored must support directories with a large number of files (those are the bands of the sparse bundle). Remember, you have external hard drive disk itself to format before you place the sparse bundle image onto that disk.\nThe man page also gives the (huge) max size for a sparse bundle:\n\n..the maximum [size] for SPARSEBUNDLE is just under 8 exabytes (2^63 - 512\n  bytes)\n\nYou can format the disk itself however you'd like, as long as the format supports the large number of files sparse bundles make in a single directory. Format your sparse bundle as HFS+ and then convert it to APFS in the future. The reason for this is there are still a few bugs in APFS, specifically regarding sparse bundles, cf. this well-explained bug report and video:\n\nI noticed that an APFS-formatted sparsebundle disk image volume showed\n  ample free space, despite that the underlying disk was completely\n  full.\n\n(2019 update: macOS Mojave resolved the free space issue above. Using an APFS sparse bundle on Mojave and newer can be safely recommended).\nYou can use Disk Utility to create your sparse bundle. If you are doing a lot of deleting from the sparse bundle, periodically run this command to remove unused bands and reclaim the space:\nhdiutil compact /path/name.sparsebundle\nNote that hdiutil compact only removes completely unused bands. So, deleting 10GB of data from your sparsebundle may only result in, say, 6GB of bands deleted when you compact. Reducing band size generally will make compact operations free up more space.\n", "Q: Auto renew Apple Developer Program with different card Does anyone know if it's possible to auto renew your Apple Developer Program with a different credit/debit card than the default one on file for your Apple ID?\n\nA: If your asking about having another credit card associated to your Apple Developer Program, aside from what you have defined on the Apple ID, the answer is NO.\nBut if your asking about replacing the default credit card information for your Apple Developer Program, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your Apple Developer Account. \n\n*Click the Membership menu.\n\n*Scroll down to Settings section.\n\n*Click on Edit default debit/credit card.\n\n\n*and you will be directed to the Apple ID website.\n\n*Go to the Payment and Shipping. and click on Edit.\n\n*Set your desired credit card information.\n\n*The Save button will be enabled then click it to save the changes.\n\nApple will now charge the new credit card upon the auto-renewal process on the Apple Developer Program renewal date.\n", "Q: How to move archived Outlook for Windows Files to Apple Mail?

In this case, I suppose I should switch to a dedicated service that does allow me to 'check' existing folders into the backup?\n\nA: The method you described involves installing a third party ln command that allows you to ask the kernel to create a hard-link for a directory.\nThe ln command from coreutils ends up executing the linkat() function in the Darwin kernel, where the source code includes the following comment:\n/*\n * Normally, linking to directories is not supported.\n * However, some file systems may have limited support.\n */\n\nIt is therefore generally not recommended to create hard-links to directories.\nIn regards to upgrading to High Sierra, your system will usually have its file system converted from HFS+ (which supports these hard-links in some cases) to APFS (which do not supports directory hard links). Therefore you will not have hard-links after conversion.\nSee the documentation from Apple on the subject here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/FAQ/FAQ.html\nEspecially the following paragraph:\n\nDirectory hard links are not supported by Apple File System. All directory hard links are converted to symbolic links or aliases when you convert from HFS+ to APFS volume formats on macOS.\n\nThe conversion program is supposed to convert these hard-links into symbolic links (soft links). The symbolic links points to new entries created in /.HFS+ Private Directory Data/.\nHowever it seems that there might be a bug involving the conversion since you've experienced loss of files. This might be due to the fact that hard linked directories are seldomly used, and cannot be created with the standard Apple supplied tools.\nTherefore I think you should file a bug report with Apple using Radar.\n\nA: You may do the opposite: move your folders into the Dropbox folder, then create symlinks to the locations you desire.\nExample :\nmv ~/Documents/cats ~/Dropbox/cats\nln -s ~/Dropbox/cats ~/Documents/cats\n\n\nA: I've been successful been using Dropbox with folders \"out of the root\" using symlinks:\n\n*\n\n*Stop Dropbox (quit the app)\n\n*Create a symlink to the destination folder anywhere within the Dropbox folder trees\n\n*Relaunch Dropbox\n\n\nThe link is synched into Dropbox as a folder in that position. Works great!\n\nEDIT: Unfortunately, as @krim mentions on the comments below, Dropbox stopped supporting this workaround at the end of 2019 \n\nA: Happened across this post as I was trying to find a way to automate deletion of hard links.  Thought I'd add my two cents.\nI've been using Sugarsync for about 5 years to avoid exactly the problem you describe.  It just backs up my files in their original directory structure.  It's worked well.\n", "Q: How can I speed up my new (but slow) 2017 iMac? I have a mid-2017 iMac that we purchased in September to replace our ageing mid-2010 iMac. The thing is this iMac feels slower than our old iMac. My husband and kids complain all the time too, so it’s not just me.\nNew iMac Specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mid-2017 iMac\n\n*Retina 4K 21.5 inch\n\n*3.0GHz quad-core Intel i5 CPU\n\n*AMD Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB Memory\n\n*1TB Hard Drive\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12.6\n\n\nOld iMac Specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mid-2010 iMac\n\n*21.5 inch\n\n*3.06GHz dual-core Intel i3 CPU\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 4670 with 256MB Memory\n\n*500GB Hard Drive\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\n\n\nObviously the new iMac has equal or better specs all round, so why does it feel so slooow?! Seems to take ages to boot, run apps, etc.\nI know I can’t upgrade the hard drive or RAM now, and I can’t run El Capitan, but is there anything else I can do? Reinstall Sierra? Maybe upgrade to High Sierra? Something else?\n\nA: Why does it feel so slow?\nYour iMac has a 1TB 5400rpm SATA Hard Drive and this is what’s causing the bottleneck. Your mid-2010 iMac would have had a 7200rpm Hard Drive. To fix this you really need to address this bottleneck.\nThe 'easiest' solution\nSince your iMac has two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports that support speeds up to 40 Gbps (via Thunderbolt) and 10 Gbps (via USB 3.1 Gen 2), the easiest solution is to use an external SSD that’s connected via one of these ports and to install macOS on that and use that drive as your main boot volume. However, you need to ensure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*it’s definitely an external SSD (and not just a hard drive)\n\n*it supports either Thunderbolt or USB-C (i.e. USB 3.1) as its interface\n\n\nBoth of the above are critical if you’re wanting to improve speed. However, you’ll probably find Thunderbolt models are too expensive, so opt for USB-C / USB 3.1. Do not get confused by USB 3 - this is not the same as USB 3.1. And remember, it needs to connect to one of the two Thunderbolt ports (not one of the USB ports).\nSome examples of the types of external drives I mean are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Samsung T5\n\n*SanDisk Extreme 510\n\n*G-Technology G-DRIVE mobile SSD\nOnce you have the drive you want, you will need to install macOS onto it and migrate your data. \nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don’t necessarily need to buy a 1TB model (although this would be ideal). The main thing is that you have enough space for your macOS installation and all your apps.\n\n*Once set up and running okay, you can use the internal hard drive as storage. If you opt for a 500GB external SSD instead of a 1TB one, you may want to consider having your Photos and/or iTunes libraries stored on your internal hard drive instead. Maybe also your iOS backups.\n\n*To install macOS you will need to reformat the drive so that it’s formatted as a OS X Extended (Journaled) drive and that its 'scheme' is GUID Partition Map.\n\n*While this iMac is not officially upgradable after purchase, it can actually be done. I upgraded the same model before Christmas so that it had an internal SSD for storage and a lot more RAM. However, I’m guessing this isn’t something you’d want to tackle (I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re very comfortable with the idea of doing it), but if you are I’m more than happy to chat to you about it.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or would like to chat about doing an internal upgrade.\n\nCase study\nToday (24 Jan 2018) I installed macOS Sierra 10.12.6 on an external SSD (specifically a 500GB Samsung T5) and did some comparison tests to try and provide an indicative idea of the type of speed improvements you could expect.\nThe tests were performed on the same model iMac as yours (i.e. mid-2017 Retina 4k iMac with 8GB RAM, a 3.0 GHz quad-core i5 CPU and a 5400rpm SATA hard drive). Obviously, your results will vary depending on the software/login items/fonts/kernel extensions you have installed.\nBelow are the results of my testing. \nTest 1: Boot up time (to Login Window): \n\n  Original boot up time: 1m 23s\n\n  New boot up time: 0m 35s\n\n\nTest 2: Login time (to full Desktop): \n\n  Original login time: 1m 15s\n\n  New login time: 0m 9s\n\n\nTest 3: Launch MS Excel:\n\n  Original load time: 0m 8s\n\n  New load time: 0m 3s\n\n\nTest 4: Launch MS PowerPoint:\n\n  Original load time: 0m 6s\n\n  New load time: 0m 3s\n\n\nTest 5:Launch MS Word:\n\n  Original load time: 0m 14s\n\n  New load time: 0m 4s\n\n\nTest 6: Launch Photos app with a 380 GB Photos library:\n\n  Original load time: 1m 23s\n\n  New load time: 0m 39s\n\n\nTesting notes:\n1. macOS and all apps were installed on the external SSD.\n2. All tests performed three times and the results averaged. \n3. Each time tests were run, they were run after a fresh reboot. \n4. For Test 6, although the Photos app was installed on the external SSD, the 380GB Photos library was stored on the internal 5400rpm SATA hard drive.\n", "Q: How to connect MacBook Pro mid-2014 to monitor: hdmi, dp or usb-c? I have a MacBook Pro mid-2014 with a HDMI port and a Thunderbolt 2 port (that I beleive doubles up as a miniDP port).\nI have just bought an Acer H2777HU 27 inch (2560 x 1440 pixel) monitor. It has a HDMI port, DP port and USB-C port.\nIt only came with a DP cable, which does not fit the miniDP port on my MacBook.\nSo my question is: what is the best way to connect the two, ensuring that I get the full 2560 x 1440 resolution, 60Hz refresh and can use the built in speakers?\nIs it:\nHDMI to HDMI (are there different sizes of HDMI?)\nminiDP to DP (does this cable exist?)\nThunderbolt 2 to USB-C (does this cable exist?)\n \nThank you\n\nA: According to this answer, you are probably better off with DisplayPort.\nDoes USB-C to HDMI take more processing power than direct USB-C to DisplayPort?\nHDMI will work, but probably only give you a 30Hz refresh rate rather than 60Hz that your system is capable of.\n\nA: Use HDMI for the connection to your Acer monitor. The HDMI cable, whatever length you choose, should have the standard (Type A) connector at either end. This page at eBay has everything you need to know about HDMI.\n", "Q: Bypass blocked Snapchat on wireless In our company they block Snapchat via wireless and we cannot use it. Is there a way to use Snapchat again on my iPhone?\n\nA: You can use mobile data which doesn't go through the Wi-Fi network.\nIf you still want to use the Wi-Fi and are not affected by the ramifications of accessing Snapchat on your work network, you can install a proxy, such as Opera VPN or Betternet.\n", "Q: iPhone often freezes nowadays Is there a reason why nowadays, even in warm conditions, my iPhone freezes and restarts? \nBy this I mean it freezes for a while and then restarts into a black screen for 10-20 secs followed by the Apple logo and then the Home screen. This can happen when taking pictures, starting an app, or just opening a link in Safari. It seems to be a software problem and only started this year.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updating iOS to 11.2.2\n\n*Taking it in for checking - the battery was replaced and they said the logic board was ok.\n\n\n\nIt's an iPhone 5s running iOS 11.2.2.\n\nA: The term \"freezing\" here should not be interpreted literally. Freezing simply means that the display stops updating, audio stops playing or similar (i.e. nothing is happening) - it doesn't have anything to do with hot or cold environments.\nThe behavior you're seeing sounds like a hardware defect.\nYou mentioned already having tried upgrading iOS. I would take a backup of the phone, and then do a complete restore of the iOS software - erasing all contents and settings on the phone. If it still freezes afterwards, it is most probably a hardware problem.\n", "Q: iTerm opens instead of default web browser when links clicked in Apple Mail Clicking on links in Apple Mail (http or https, doesn't matter), opens a new iTerm 2 terminal session instead of my default browser. I can't figure it out.\nWeirdly, iTerm.app shows up as a potential email handler under Mail.app > Preferences > General > Default email reader.  It wasn't selected (Mail.app was), but I tried selecting something else (Microsoft Outlook.app, in my case), as per this question, just in case some setting there had been messed up (obviously this should be irrelevant to the problem at hand but you never know how things are cross-linked under the hood). Interestingly, that setting would not stick: upon quitting and re-opening Mail.app, Mail.app would again be selected as the default email reader. But none of that changed the behavior. It's very confusing, but I'm wondering if I've just reached the end of the useful lifetime of Apple Mail under OS X 10.11.6 (yes, yes, I know, way out of date - I haven't updated because of compatibility concerns with software I need to use to do my job.. but maybe I will bite the bullet soon). Mail.app version is 9.3 (3124).\nUpdate: So, looking at my default browser under Apple > System Preferences > General > Default web browser shows nothing selected, and when I click on the dropdown menu, there are no items available to select, which of course is ridiculous, as I'm software developer and have four browsers installed (Opera, Safari, Chrome and Firefox). So I'm guessing some .plist that contains the default web browser has become corrupted.\n\nA: Rebooting solved this one. After the reboot, the list of browsers under Apple > System Preferences > General > Default web browser was restored, and clicking web links in Mail.app resumed opening in my default browser.\nInterestingly, ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist, which was empty before the reboot, remained empty afterwards, so I'm guessing the list of browsers isn't stored there. (Thought it might be stored there because of this post). (The file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist doesn't exist, either)\n", "Q: How does Time Machine restore backups from APFS volumes? Is Time Machine aware of any of the new APFS features, e.g. sparse files, file cloning etc.? As the Time Machine volume itself is still an HFS plus volume, I would expect some difficulties in mapping these concepts to the older file system.\nI'm asking because I use some of these extensively (e.g. file cloning for organising my photo library and sparse files for Docker), to the point where they would not fit onto a volume when restored as regular files.\nI have done some tests with zero-copied files, and it seems that at least these seem to be represented as hard links in the Time Machine backup volume, but I wonder if they are also restored as such (which would actually break some use cases, as COW space sharing and hard links behave differently when writing to the files).\nIn other words:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Time Machine restore sparse files as such, or are the restored files non-sparse?\n\n*Does Time Machine restore cloned files (created e.g. using the finder or cp -c) as such? Or are they restored as regular duplicate files (or, potentially worse, as a single file with multiple hard links)? If so, is there a difference when only part of the file is shared, versus all blocks?\n\n\nA: Time Machine at the moment of writing doesn't support APFS for the backup destination (see this), while it can backup FROM an APFS or HFS+ volume. That's because the AFPS filesystem doesn't support directory hardlinks, which Time Machine heavily relies on.\nProbably Time Machine needs to be rewritten to take advantage of the features you mentioned, which is something that can happen in future versions of macOS.\n", "Q: App Store email varies from Apple ID, where can this be set up on iPad Pro When setting up new iPad Pro-by default it only permits one email address to be used for Apple ID & App Store.

The reason your getting \"logged out\" is probably that the ESD is causing a power surge that makes the laptop think the lid was closed (you're getting current from a sensor that isn't actually the source of the current).\nIt's best not to sit electronics on soft surfaces such as beds, carpets, etc as ESD can damage the hardware if a charge with too strong a current goes through it.  If you've ever gotten a good hard shock when you touch the door knob after walking across the carpet in socks, you know what I'm talking about.  :-)\nToo more directly answer your question \"How do I correct this?\", the obvious answer is the best one: don't put your laptop on your bed.  Make sure you use a laptop desk (something like this: https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/781650/Lap-Desk-Originals-Student-Lap-Desk/ or even a simple board so the computer is sitting on a smooth hard surface where it won't be affected by static, and will much more easily cool itself.  (Sheets don't just hold static, they hold heat too.)\n", "Q: Can I text from iPad with only an email address? My wife has a wifi-only iPad. She'd like to be able to send and receive texts from it, but it has no phone number, and she has no other Apple device to send/receive texts through. She's configured iMessage to know her email address and she's logged in to Apple using her Apple ID, but texting from my iPhone to her email address (using iMessage) results in the message showing up in her email, not in iMessage.\nIs there a way to configure things so that she can send and receive texts on the iPad, even though there's no phone number for it? I already have iMessage on the iPad set up to send and receive messages at her email address, but that doesn't seem to be enough.\n\nA: Off the top of my head, here are the settings that could affect that:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Messages preferences, make sure that her email address is not only listed for both Send and Receive, but is also checked.\n\n*Make sure the checked email address is her iCloud address that was created when you/she set up iCloud (her_name@icloud.com).\n\n*At the top of the Messages prefs, make sure Messages is turned on.\n\n\nOn your side, if you're using a contact card to Message her, make sure you're using the \"message\" button, and not \"mail\". (Less likely, I know, but worth mentioning.)\nAlso, keep in mind that she can only send iCloud Messages with this setup. She'll need an iPhone if she wants to also use SMS.  (Apple uses the phone as the SMS gateway for other iDevices and Macs.)  So if you're sending SMS messages to her from a non-Apple phone (or if you've set your iPhone to only send SMS), she won't see it in Messages. \nThat may not be comprehensive, but that's the stuff I can think of that I've seen muck up Messages before.  The \"off switch\" for Messages is probably the most common one. \n", "Q: How to restore bluetooth PAN?

I am aware that I am not to ask these kinds of questions in a reply, so I am going to make some assumptions about this situation. If any of these are false, let me know and I'll reconsider.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am assuming you were not doing an update when the iPhone froze. If you were doing an update, you may have some other issues. I would like to know what iOS version you are running, but I can live without that info.\n\n*I know you mentioned the steps of hard rebooting, but it sounds like the reboot was not successful. I apologize if I have misinterpreted this. That being said, hard reboot this phone. For iPhone 8, hard rebooting is a bit different than in other iPhones. After hard rebooting, you may encounter the loading screen again, but it should start loading. Please follow these instructions\n\n*Please note that one hard reboot may not work, but three hard reboots in quick succession (meaning when you see the Apple logo appear, hard reboot again immediately) can cure a LOT of software problems. Also note that it is entirely possible that this is a fluke. I work as an iPad specialist for a school corporation, and I have noticed on several occasions that three hard reboots have solved some unusual iOS issues. \n\n*If the three hard reboots still fail, please try another hard reboot and hold in the side switch to force a \"connect to iTunes\" message (information about doing that can be found on the same link I mentioned earlier).

But the problem is, this issue starts to appear after some time (probably after reboot, I'm not sure what causes it to appear again). UPD: it's most likely not caused by rebooting, cause I've just faced it 10 minutes after executing the code above, and got the same error. I didn't reboot my laptop since then.\nWhat can cause such a behaviour and how can I fix this?\n\nA: I think this happen because when you generated your ssh key, you entered a passphrase for security. When you start the ssh-agent and add ssh/rsa_id it should as for the passphrase.\n[root@user xxxxx]# eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nAgent pid 12082\n[root@user xxxxx]# ssh-add /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa\nEnter passphrase for /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa:\nIdentity added: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa)\n\ngit push -u origin master\nCounting objects: 94, done.\n\n\nA: Okay, forgot to post the issue: I've accidentally set my key to other server for all hosts in ~/.ssh/config. So it used it for connecting to all hosts instead of the right one. I've deleted it for all hosts and set it up only for those hosts which required that key, and it fixed it.\nHope it'll be helpful to others.\n", "Q: Secure traffic before connecting to wifi/VPN? Usually when you wake up your MacBook, macOS automatically establishes e.g. IMAP or various background sync connections. How can I make sure that all traffic is sent over to VPN connection BEFORE I connect to wifi or my VPN connection fails?\nI am using Apple’s built-in VPN client in OS X 10.12. VPN service order is set prior wifi in the OS X Network location. Also, the checkbox for for „Send all traffic over VPN connection“ is enabled.\n\nA: According to an article by How-To Geek How to Connect Your Mac to Any VPN (and Automatically Reconnect), there is an app that can do this for you, but first: \n\nThe “Advanced” button allows you to configure the VPN connection in other ways. For example, the default settings automatically disconnect from the VPN when you log out or switch users. You could uncheck these boxes to prevent the Mac from automatically disconnecting. Click Apply to save your settings. Before you do, you can enable the “Show VPN status in menu bar” option to get a menu bar icon for managing your VPN connection. Use this menu to connect to your VPN and disconnect from it as necessary.\n\nHowever, the article also says:\n\nBy default, your Mac won’t automatically reconnect to the VPN if the connection dies.\n\n VPN AutoConnect by Nova-box is the app the article talks about, but it does not have a very good rating, so I am not sure if it would benefit you.\nI use a VPN, but I am not using Apple's client for this. I use the VPN's client. I did download it from the App Store, and it has been great thus far—there is a feature that allows you to prevent any traffic from running until the VPN is up and running.\nThe VPN I have is  VPN Unlimited - WiFi Proxy. I purchased a lifetime subscription for around $20 from Cult Of Mac when they had a special on it. \nThere could be Terminal commands for this as well. I have found this other Ask Different question for you to take a look at: Where is the \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\" setting in OSX 10.9 Mavericks?\nThis last link to a Tuts+ article How to Use VPN on Your Mac is basically what you said you already did, from my understanding, but I thought it might be useful in case you wanted to double check your steps (since I haven't used the Apple client, I can't speak for it, hence this link).\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Looking for replacement surface mount component in MacBook Air (A1466) mainboard After liquid damage my backlight was broken.

I don't have a mouse, keyboard, or monitor for the computer. I do have an ethernet cable, but not a crosslink cable.\nIs there a way to use my current MacBook Air (running the latest OS) to get the files off of the PowerCenter? I assume I can try to find a shop to pull the SCSI drive and transfer it to USB, but I'd rather not do that if possible.\n\nA: If you don't have the right control panels installed then the Ethernet port won't be active. \nThe cheapest way to access it would be to buy an old keyboard and mouse or take it to a computer shop that has them. Or you could send it to a data recovery service.\nSCSI drives have not been used for so long that getting an adapter and mounting the drive to a newer Mac will probably cost more than the used keyboard and mouse.\nGood,luck!\n\nA: The best course of action is to pull the data off the drive via USB with a USB to SCSI adapter like the Adaptec USBXchange.\nYou can do this without spending a lot of money (definitely less than having a shop or a tech do this).  Though the hardware is obsolete, you are in luck because macOS (OS X) supports USB Attached SCSI meaning your drive will show up as a mounted volume.\nTo do this, you will need the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Adaptec USBXchange USB to SCSI Adapter.  This will give you the USB attached SCSI functionality.\n\n*HD50 to IDC 50 (External/Internal) SCSI Adapter (removed from bracket if possible).  This will convert the IDC 50 pin connector on the HDD to the HD50 pin connector (for external SCSI drives) on the USB adapter.\n\nProbably the most daunting task is getting access to the drive, but in actuality, it isn't all that difficult.  The PowerCenter 150 is a Mac clone and is put together more like a PC than a Mac in that respect.  Opening the case and accessing the drive is no different than the procedure for opening a PC case.

So yes you could turn it on, plug an ethernet cable between the two but it is unlikely that the MacBook Air will be able to see anything on the old clone.\nThere are (were?) versions of Appleshare for OS X but I don't know if they are still available and/or compatible with current versions of macOS. A little google-fu for Appleshare, netatalk and the like might find you something that might work.\nOf course all of this assumes that sharing is turned on, on your clone and everything is accessible. If sharing is off or password protected and you don't know the username/password you may be out of luck.\nHonestly the simplest way would be to find someone with an old Mac that can attach your SCSI drive and burn a CD with the files you need, or transfer it to a thumb drive.

These are server processes of the software I am developing. They can be recompiled and changed multiple times a day. The binaries can live in different places (working copies).\nMy script uses\n set sudo to do shell script \"sudo -v \"\n\nto ask for the root password once, then creates a new iterm2 terminal window (and some tabs) and tries to start the servers with sudo:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run args\n    set sudo to do shell script \"sudo -v \" -- to ask for password once only\n    tell application \"iTerm\"\n        create window with default profile\n        tell current window\n            tell current session\n                write text \"sudo /some/server\"\n            end tell\n            -- more tabs and more sudos go here\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nEverything worked fine on El Capitan, but not on High Sierra.\nIf the sudo password is not cached, the sudo -v asks for my password and then proceeds --- as expected. If I ran sudo before and the password is cached, the sudo -v does not ask for a password, again, as expected.\nBut in both cases each of the subsequent sudos in the new window does ask for my password, making the whole thing inconvenient.\nWhen I add with administrator privileges to the initial sudo it does ask for my password in a popup dialog but the following sudo calls with write text still ask for the password on the shell.\n(I use write text and the terminal to keep an eye on these servers' outputs.)\nI can run regular sudo commands just fine and it does cache the password.\nHow can I use sudo in Applescript in a new iTerm2 window and have it ask for the password only once?\nEDIT: Looks like this is not related to Applescript but to iterm and High Sierra. When I open a terminal window with 2 tabs, I need to enter my password in both when I run e.g., sudo ls. After that both tabs have the sudo password cached, but running sudo in one tab does not make the other tab use the cached sudo password.\nSo the real question is probably: how do I get iTerm2 to cache the sudo password and share that between tabs and windows?\n\nA: Try adding:\nDefaults !tty_tickets\n\nto /etc/sudoers. Tested on 10.13.6 (High Sierra).\nFrom the man page:\n\nIf set, users must authenticate on a per-tty basis.

The situation is summed up in this reddit post.  The problem boils down to: I have no admin user who has a secure token and it seems like I cannot get one.  This can be confirmed by running:\nsysadminctl interactive -secureTokenStatus USER_NAME\nfor every user.  It always comes back with\nSecure token is DISABLED for user USER_NAME\nThe first setup from factory settings did not result in a user with a Secure Token, and I tried to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete /var/db/.AppleSetupDone to setup a new admin account. Result: A new admin account that slo does not have a token.\n\n*Reinstall MacOS High Sierra: First created admin user does not have secure token.\n\n\nIt seems that this is either intentional (because of the Fusion Drive?) or a bug in High Sierra.  With exactly the same procedure on a Macbook Pro 2017 I get an admin user with a Secure Token and that user can manage FileVault and give secure tokens to other users.\nSince I want to use FileVault, I also tried to reformat the main disk with an encrypted file system, reinstalling MacOS and restoring from time machine backup. This worked, FileVault is enabled, but now I have to enter the disk password every time the computer boots (before the login screen).  I don't want this, I want to unlock the disk with a user password.\nWhat can I do to get an admin user with a secure token?\n\nA: Just migrated to a new 2018 MacBook Pro, and somehow my original account (an admin user) was created without a secure token during the migration. I even tried creating a new admin user, logging into that user and trying to run sysadminctl -secureTokenOn justin -password - but getting:\n\n2018-07-30 14:17:56.552 sysadminctl[886:18232] Operation is not permitted without secure token unlock.\n\nSo then I tried the following providing adminUser and adminPassword flags as my original user justin:\n\nsysadminctl -secureTokenOn justin -password - -adminUser justin -adminPassword -\nEnter password for justin :\nEnter password for Justin K :\n2018-07-30 14:31:05.262 sysadminctl[998:49031] setSecureTokenAuthorizationEnabled error Error Domain=com.apple.OpenDirectory Code=5101 \"Authentication server refused operation because the current credentials are not authorized for the requested operation.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Authentication server refused operation because the current credentials are not authorized for the requested operation., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Authentication server refused operation because the current credentials are not authorized for the requested operation.}\n\nEssentially it seems since non of my users have a secure token, there is no way to grant a secure token. The only downfall is the following:\n\n*\n\n*When I cold start the machine I have to enter a disk decryption password, which results in entering my password twice (once for disk decryption and once for the user account).\n\n\n*When I try to turn off FileVault by clicking the button nothing happens. The same behavior when clicking the warning button \"Some users are not able to unlock the disk [Enable Users...]\" nothing happens.\n\n\nA: I found myself in this situation. I think this was because I did a clean OS install while FileVault was enabled, so the users weren't migrated.\nAccordingly, System Preferences complained \"Some users are not able to unlock the disk\" but clicking \"Enable Users\" did nothing, sysadminctl -secureTokenStatus jrc (my main user) said \"DISABLED\", and sysadminctl -secureTokenOn ... was useless.\nA clue came from the fact that fdesetup list -extended reported a \"Unknown User\" entry. So I solved the problem by creating a new user, changing the UUID of that user to that of the unknown user, and using that new user to fix up my existing user. This required a trip to recovery mode (or single user mode) as the Directory Services store is protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP).\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the UUID of the unknown user(s) reported from sudo fdesetup list -extended.\n\n*In System Preferences > Users & Groups, create a new administrator user (named admin in this example) using the same password as your main user account.\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode and changing the GeneratedUID of the newly created user to match the above UUID. This can be done by opening Utilities menu > Terminal in Recovery Mode, then running dscl -f \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default\" localonly -changei /Local/Default/Users/admin GeneratedUID 1 5BBB4CE0-FEC9-4922-A456-5FE00534C065. Substitute your volume name, username, and UUID as appropriate. Everything is case-sensitive.\n\n*Reboot normally. sysadminctl -secureTokenStatus admin should now report \"ENABLED\". (Yay!)\n\n*sudo fdesetup add -usertoadd jrc. When prompted, enter the credentials of the above admin user.\n\n*Finally, run diskutil apfs updatePreboot / to fix up the boot graphics.\n\n\nSome related links that I found helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://carpeaqua.com/2017/11/30/updating-your-apfs-encrypted-volume-filevault-password/\n\n*https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2019/02/10/re-syncing-local-account-passwords-and-secure-token-on-filevault-encrypted-macs-running-macos-mojave/\n\nA: It does seem you've come across a bug, since you should be granted a secure token when…\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Secure Token is automatically enabled for the user account created by Apple’s Setup Assistant.\n  \n*The Setup Assistant-created user account with Secure Token then creates other users via the Users & Groups preference pane in System Preferences. Those accounts get their own Secure Token automatically.\n  \n\nSecure Token and FileVault on Apple File System - Der Flounder\nTo manually grant a secure token, run\nsysadminctl -secureTokenOn yourusername -password -\n\nwhere yourusername is the username of the user you wish to grant a secure token to. Don't forget the hyphen at the end too! Don't use sudo.\nYou'll first be prompted to ‘unlock’ Users & Groups preferences by providing administrator credentials to the GUI dialog, then you'll be prompted for the password to the account you wish to give a token to on the CLI.\n\nA: I was able to make this work. First, diagnoze that you have the same issue. Run: \nsysadminctl -secureTokenStatus <username>\n\nIf it shows \"secure token disabled,\" and you have no other users on the system that have it enabled, you need to go through this dance. \nForce the Apple Setup wizard to run on your next install by running:\nsudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nAnd restart your computer. After the restart finishes, log in as this new admin and  create a new admin user;  with that user, go to Settings | Security & Privacy | File Vault, and grant your actual user the privileges to unlock the file system. Run this again, it should now say enabled for your actual user:\nsysadminctl -secureTokenStatus <username>\n\n\nA: I have the same issue and removing the AppleSetupDone file and rebooting to force the creation of a new admin account doesn't give the new account a token. The only thing that has worked has been backing up the user profile, flattening the machine and doing a new High Sierra install from a bootable USB, not exactly ideal when I've got loads of Macs to upgrade to the 10.13.\n\nA: In this answer I will outline my resolution of the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I contacted AppleCare and together we tried various things like reinstalling MacOS High Sierra and trying to enable FileVault before the migration of any user data. This is not successful.\n\n*The Internet Recovery on this Mac installs MacOS Sierra and in MacOS Sierra FileVault can be enabled. (This clearly indicates a software issue) One can then update to High Sierra and use Migration assistant to get the user data back. The problem is that in this situation only the users that were created in Sierra can unlock the disk, not any users migrated or created after the migration.\n\n*AppleCare tried to reproduced my issue on a similar iMac with Fusion Drive and they could not. They offered to look at it in person, but the next store is quite a drive away, so I did not go for this option.\n\n*Since rebooting the computer does not happen so often, I settled for myself with the solution to install High Sierra inside a volume that is encrypted from the start.  This works, but leads to the situation where you have to enter the decryption password every time the computer boots. \n\n*After installing the latest Supplemental Update, the boot loader was probably rewritten or something, I'm now in a situation where after first boot a screen appears in which both users can log in, or I can unlock the disk. It looks like this:\n\nOn this screen both users can log in and thereby unlock the disk. The third option is to unlock the disk upon which another login screen with only the two users is presented.\n\n\nThat means the problem is basically solved, except that there is this strange login item, but well...\nI also confirmed with Apple Support that the Secure Token situation described in the question is most likely irrelevant because Secure Tokens pertain to APFS and this is a Mac with a Fusion Drive.\n", "Q: How to deal with phone dropped in water I have an iPhone 6s and this is the second time I have dropped my phone into water. I managed to get it replaced the first time (this was only a few weeks ago) but it happened again. It initially didn't seem to be as bad as it was before so I'm hoping this can somehow be fixed.\nI dropped it in the sink and there wasn't much water in there so I didn't think it would be that damaged. I was relieved to hear the music working on it, as this was not the case before, but it was quiet and muffled. So I placed it in some rice for a day but it seems to just be getting worse. The phone keeps putting down the volume by itself now and I cannot hear any music at all as when I keep putting the volume up it just goes back down. Should I just keep it there for a couple of more days or go back to the shop and buy a new one?\n\nA: You can try to take it to a 3rd-party repair store to get it cleaned, there's a chance that they can repair corrosion caused by water damage.\n", "Q: Built-in or FOSS GUI application for generating a file hash I would like to know if there's a built-in GUI application in Mac OS X that can generate file hashes (Disk Utility?). If there isn't such a built-in application, does a FOSS alternative exist?  I can accept any application that can generate a file hash as CRC, MD5, or better in the SHA realm. \nAdditionally, showing how this is done in the application would be a bonus.\n\nA: If you want to find a method of converting general CLI scripts to the GUI, take a look at Platypus. Using this application, you can create GUI wrappers around CLI utilities. It's fairly straightforward to make a shasum or md5 wrapper that can allow drag and drop.\nHowever, there are existing applications available to show file hashes (see Allan's answer).\n\nA: Quickhash-GUI seems to be what you're looking for.  It's cross platform meaning it will be the same \"workflow\" across macOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\nQuickHash GUI is an open-source Linux, Windows, and Apple Mac OSX\n  graphical interface that enables easy and rapid data hashing of data :\n  text, text files line by line, binary files, file comparisons, folder\n  comparisons, disks and drive volumes (as administrator), Base64 data,\n  as well as allowing files in one folder to be copied to another with\n  data hashing conducted at either side for comparisons and data\n  integrity.\n\n\n", "Q: Macintosh Color Classic won't turn on and has weird boot chimes I recently got my hands on a Macintosh Color Classic that is known to not work in the hope of fixing it. I have the power plugged in, keyboard, and mouse. When I flip the switch on the back, I hear the fan come on, and then three monotone chimes about a second apart. I have searched for manuals or docs to tell me what these chimes mean, because they aren't the normal Sad or Happy Mac chimes. After those chimes, the fan remains on but the screen stays dark. Any ideas?\n\nA: Quite possibly the \"chimes of death.\"\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, pull the motherborard, and try it with different RAM configurations. Look for capacitors with swollen tops (little cylinders) and possibly even replace the PRAM battery.\nThe board itself could be toast but that should get you started on what to try.\n", "Q: Block Specific Apps on macOS Is there a way to block a list of specific apps on macOS?\nI have looked up solutions such as Cisdem, but there are some holes in the way it works that I don't like.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unless you also block Activity Monitor, Terminal, and System Preferences, you can simply quit the Cisdem process or create a new user to get around it.\n\n*You have to block Activity Monitor, Terminal, and System Preferences to make it work well.\n\n\nI want to block an app from running or even being installed on my Mac. The app can be installed via the App Store and the web. Not sure how to go about this. Enabling Parental Controls won't work as Administrator privileges are needed. \nThe specific app I want to block is Apple Configurator.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Use Gatekeeper to control access to Applications\nYou can use spctl (Gatekeeper) to create lists of approved and unapproved apps.\nFor example, suppose you want to allow Mail but block Chrome.\nsudo spctl --add --label \"ApprovedApps\" /Applications/Mail.app \nsudo spctl --add --label \"DeniedApps\" /Applications/Chrome.app\n\nThe above command will will \"label\" Mail and Chrome as \"Approved\" and \"Denied\" respectively (you can use your own descriptors).\nNow, to enable/disable apps, you issue the commands:\nsudo spctl --enable --label \"ApprovedApps\" \nsudo spctl --disable --label \"DeniedApps\" \n\nThe advantage this has is that to add another app to either list, you just have to add the appropriate label:\nsudo spctl --add --label \"ApprovedApps\" /Applications/Another.app\n\nAdditionally, you can forbid code from the Mac App Store from running (found in the spctl man page - man spctl).\nspctl --disable --label \"Mac App Store\"\n\nThis will prevent anyone from downloading an App from the App store and installing/running it.\nDealing with Admins/sudoers\nAs stated in the comments, anything an Admin can do, another Admin can undo.  Using spctl requires root, but editing the sudoers file to restict access to a particular command can prevent other users/admins from undoing your changes.\nSee How to prevent sudo users from running specific commands? for details on how to configure a \"whitelist with exception\" in your sudoers file.\nFor example, to allow user Sam access to all commands except spctl, you would put in the sudoers file:\nsam ALL = ALL, !/usr/sbin/spctl\n\nNow, this a \"quick and dirty\" way of preventing access to spctl but ultimately, it's not effective because if the other admin gets wise to your strategy, all he/she has to do is rename the command and they have access.  \nFrom the sudoers man page:\n\nIn general, if a user has sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them from creating their own program that gives\n         them a root shell (or making their own copy of a shell) regardless of any `!' elements in the user\n         specification.\n\nTo really lock it down, you would need to either force the other user to su as a different user (i.e. operator) or create a whitelist of allowed commands defaulting to blocking everything else.  However, that is time consuming and quite dangerous as you can lock people out of critical functions.  \n", "Q: Photos not downloading latest images to macOS Apple's Photos app has stopped downloading photos from iCloud (though I can confirm that they are present in iCloud.com and all my other devices). Only recent photos seem to be missing. I've waited a day, an still nothing. I've rebooted, turned Photos off and on in Account settings, force quit Photos, etc. I've even repaired the photo library. There is no indication that the Photos app is syncing.\nHow do I get Apple's Photos app to download recent photos from iCloud?\n\nA: Make sure that your Mac is still uploading photos. Open the photos app and then go to the word Photos (next to File and Edit in the status bar) and then click on preferences. Then go over to the iCloud tab and you'll probably see that photos are uploading but the blue bar isnt moving or present. Click on the pause iCloud Photo Library button. Wait a minute, check your connection. Then unpause it and make sure that you Mac has a power cable plugged in and the screensaver/sleep timer turned off.\nIt should start uploading/downloading again in amounts.\nThat should fix your issue. If you have tried that before and it hasnt started the process then see if you can refresh your iCloud connection by signing out and then signing back in. That usually gets things moving again.\n", "Q: Developer Enrollment Paying Issue Today i made a payment of 99$ to get some certificate for developement but now apple just sent me a email saying: \nThe billing information you used on the Apple Online Store to purchase an Apple Developer Program membership does not match the billing information you provided during enrollment. Before your membership can be activated, we'll need a copy of your government-issued photo ID.\nSo i did the payment with my father Debit Card and i was wondering if is it gonna be okay if i send my passport photo, contact them, send them some papers saying that my father was conscious of this payment or should i send them something else?. \n\nA: According to Apple's Development Program Payment page:\n\nPayment\nYou can choose from the payment methods presented during your membership purchase. If you are paying by credit card and enrolling as an individual, you must use your own credit card to complete your purchase. If you do not, your enrollment will be delayed and you will be asked for a copy of your government-issued photo identification. After you’ve completed your purchase, you will receive an order acknowledgement email from Apple Online Store and a confirmation email from Apple Developer Relations.\n\nApple puts all relevant info for the developer program online and it's fairly easy to search and find the answers.  Go to the page I linked-to if you have more questions.  You can also contact Apple directly.\n", "Q: When downloading in Safari there is significant upstream data, why? Most of the time (all of the time?) when I download a large file using Safari from any website I see 1/3 as much data being uploaded. So if I'm seeing 3MB/s downloading I'll see about 1MB/s uploading. I'm not doing anything else.\nWhat is being uploaded?\nTo be clear, when the App Store is downloading updates this doesn't happen. 3MB/s downloading in the App Store will show about 80KB/s uploading, which is commensurate with my vague memory of how TCP/IP verifies packets received.\nIs Safari automatically doing something like Bit Torrent?\n\nA: No, Safari is not automatically doing anything like BitTorrent. No need to worry about that.\nWhen downloading a file over HTTP/HTTPS (normally the case with Safari), the system needs to upload as well in order to facilitate the transfer of the file. This cannot be avoided no matter which browser is used.\nNormally the internal \"house keeping\" that is uploaded is small compared to the amount of downloaded data. However, it can vary depending on configuration settings, network circumstances, etc. I.e. for example if you choose to have a low MTU settings, if you have lots of network errors (failures and retransmits), etc. - the amount of upload overhead can be larger than normal.\nHowever 1 MB/s compared to 3 MB/s seems quite excessive. I would investigate further if the upload really stems from Safari or not. Try:\n(a) downloading from other sites to see if the effect persists,\n(b) download with a different browser than Safari to see if the effect persists,\n(c) ensure that you haven't got other programs running that might be uploading, for example a continouus backup program (like Crashplan, Backblaze or similar, or even Time Machine) that simultaneously uploads the downloaded file to your cloud backup or NAS,\n(d) if all else fails, create a dump of your network traffic and examine with Wireshark or similar to see what exactly is transferred over the network.  \n", "Q: Confusing reverse DNS IP replacement, ever since I edited /etc/hosts A while ago I was trying to set up convenient ssh to a server, so I added an entry to /etc/hosts (not real IP):\n# Host Database\n104.111.11.1    dokku.1\n\nI've realized since then that using ~/.ssh/config is a better solution, so I removed the hosts entry. But ever since then, the IP seems to reverse-resolve to dokku.1 when I try to visit that IP in safari, it replaces it with dokku.1, then fails to resolve the hostname. Does anyone know where that resolving behavior is coming from, and how to stop it? I have rebooted the computer since I removed the entry.\nmacOS 10.12.6\n\nA: Welp, turns out it's actually the server at the IP address returning an HTTP 301 redirect. It was just so fast I didn't notice.\n", "Q: Where can I find the schematics/CAD model for MacBook Pro's components? Device: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\nI'm looking for detailed schematics, preferably official Apple publications, describing and/or annotating the dimensions or other specifics of the components. I'm not looking for electrical layout diagrams.\nMy goal is to create an acrylic chassis inspired by the old iMacs to replace the aluminum. Any leads on the topic of this documentation is welcome, even if it's not everything.\nThe particular part I am interested in is pictured below:\n\n\nA: Apple isn't known for making their computer parts user replaceable or making their parts public, because of this I would think it would be highly unlikely Apple would publish CAD files/designs of parts. Here are some possibilities I can think of for finding a CAD file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a patent.\nI'm not sure if Apple patented the chassis, but if they did you might be able to find the patent. If you're able to find it you could take the dimensions of it and turn it into a CAD file using a software like Blender, Fusion 360 or any other CAD application.\n\n*Contact a third party part manufacturer.\nThere are multiple third parties that manufacture Apple computer parts. One example of those companies is iFixIt. They provide some parts, kits, and guides for replacing certain computer parts. I took the time to find the parts you need. The bottom chassis is made up of two different parts. The first part is the upper case assembly, the second is the lower case assembly. If you contact them and explain your situation to them, they might provide you with CAD files, this isn't the most likely though.\n\n*Using a ruler and CAD software.\nYou've said you couldn't find any CAD files online so I won't mention that. That leaves one solution. Making your own CAD file, and just so you know, it's probably as complicated and time-consuming as it sounds. It's one thing just to make the part so it looks similar, but it's another thing to make it so it fits.\nGood look finding/making the CAD file so you can make this part. I will look for a patent and make an update if I can find one.\nP.S. Just so you know the part in the older macs is made out of plastic/rubber and not acrylic.\n\nA: Apple has a a program and guidelines designed to assist 3rd party manufacturers develop products for Apple Devices. \nSee:  Designing Accessories\nSpecific to what you’re looking for, see Accessory Design Guidelines for Apple Devices\n\nIncludes detailed device dimensional drawings and important considerations for creating cases, covers, screen overlays, and camera attachments.\n\n", "Q: OSx doesn't want to activate my Bluetooth dongle I recently bought an external bluetooth dongle to add BTLE support to my Macbook Pro 2011.  I'm running Yosemite 10.10.2.\nI've read different blogs and posts here, indicating how to enable the external dongle, but they don't seem to work.  Following the answers to this AD question, I've tried downloading the Bluetooth Explorer found in the HardwareIOTools_Xcode_6.3.dmg package.  But when I navigate to Tools->HCI Controller Selector, and choose the Broadcomm dongle and click Activate, the built-in Apple BRCM device remains active, and doesn't activate my external dongle.\n\nI've also tried to update the nvram settings and rebooting:\nsudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always\n\nbut that too doesn't have any impact.\nWhat am I missing or doing wrong?\n\nA: It turns out Bluetooth Explorer has an awkward UI, whether by sloppy design, implementation, or bug.  The HCI Controller Selector does not show the active controller in the menu.  It shows you the first item of some default menu order, even after you've picked a different item and clicked Activate.  But the different controller was activated, even though it doesn't look like it—unless you pay attention to details in the drop-down menu.\nIt's easiest to see with pictures.  Here's what the Bluetooth Explorer HCI Controller Selector looks like when I launch it:\n\nWhen I click on the menu I see this:\n\nIf I click on the \"Cambridge Silicon Radio\" item and then click Activate, Bluetooth connectivity is lost for a moment and from the behavior of my connected keyboard and trackpad when it comes back I am certain that the Cambridge radio was indeed made the active controller.  However, what the controller selector window looks like at this point is identical to the first image, as if the change was not made, even though it was.\nHowever, if you look closely at that second image showing the pull-down menu opened up, you can see that it says \"[ACTIVE]\" next to the Cambridge item.  That's because I had previously made it active.  So there is a way to tell the activation worked; it's just not by looking at what the menu shows when it's collapsed.\nSo the technique you were trying to use probably worked, even though you had difficulty telling it.\nI am still looking for a method to make the change permanent across reboots, but haven't found it.  The suggested nvram command doesn't work for that, at least not on my macOS Mojave 10.14.6 system.  I have it set to \"always\", but a reboot always goes back to the default, built-in Apple controller, which is a problem for my setup.\n", "Q: High Sierra how to move menu bar to external monitor [MBP 2014, Mac OS High Sierra]\nI managed to crack the lower left corner of my screen last night, the power cable flicked into the space as I was closing the lid.  As a result, I'm missing a couple inches of screen space on the left side.  This, of course, means that I cannot see the \"Apple Icon\" (not too big a deal) nor the first, usually \"File\", menu item.\nSince I usually have an external screen plugged in, I would like to move the menu bar to the other screen.  However, I don't want to use the Mission Control function to create another space (Desktop).\nCan this be done, and if so, how?\n\nA: When you have the external screen connected, in system preferences : Display you can move that menu bar to the other screen - I usually get the displays icon in the menu bar as well.\n", "Q: How to turn off the iSight indicator when I'm using the Camera? How to turn off the iSight indicator of my Mac's camera (without putting black tape on it)? \n\nA: No, you cant.\nFortunately (or in your case unfortunately) there is no way to simply hit a switch that turns off the light. The problem is that the iSight camera's light is set to come on whenever an application uses it.\nIt's partly a security feature built-in for your own convenience. Think if it like the \"On Air\" sign in a way.\nDepending on your model of mac (you didn't mention one specifically) it may be possible to physically disconnect the LED light from the controller, rendering it offline until plugged in again. However, for the majority of new Macs this may prove a challenge.\nIf your bezel doesn't happen to be white metal (think MacBook Air), you could go over it with a black permanent marker. Something that greatly reduces the light emitted from the iSight indicator.\nAt this time, there is no software to disable it. You would either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the Application using the camera.\n\n*Inhibit the physical connection to the indicator.\n\n\nHopefully that shed some light on the situation in 2018 as similar questions have attracted a lot of attention over the years. Even I have searched for a solution many years ago but have learnt since to ignore it.\nLet me know what model you have and I might be able to be a little more specific in my reasoning (much has changed in the physical layout of the bezel). Let me know how you make out or if you come up with a better solution, I'd be very interested myself.\n", "Q: How can I use bluetooth to transfer files between my iPhone 6 and my Windows 10 laptop?

However, if I run on school WiFi, VPN hangs on \"Connecting...\" and after 10 seconds it disconnects and tries again. I believe this is a WiFi problem, but I don't know for sure.\n\nA: Most schools have firewalls on their network that prevent VPNs from being used. This is because firewall website filtering can be usually bypassed by using a VPN.\nSo as you guessed, it is something on the network that’s blocking the VPN.\nAnd just so you know I have not found a way to bypass a VPN blocker or firewall(I am also a student at a school with a similar firewall)\n\nA: Use Psiphon, it is a vpn designed to bypass firewalls.

I upgraded my macbook pro and have now two internal SSD drives (I removed the old drive and also the DVD drive).\nI have been using Time Machine to back up the 1st drive to an external drive, and I now wonder if there is any way I can also use Time Machine to back up the new second SSD drive.\nHope it makes sense..\nso I back up my main SSD-1 drive to an external drive called Backup1.\nand now would like to back up my second drive called SSD-2 to a second drive called Backup2.\nIs it possible to use Time Machine for that?\n\nA: No, you cannot do this with Time Machine unfortunately.\nWhat you can actually do is backup both internal SSD drives to the same external drives - or backup both internal SSD drives to two different external drives.\nHowever, you cannot setup it up so that SSD #1 only is backed up to external drive #1, and SSD #2 only to external drive #2.\n\nA: It can back up two drives, but Time Machine will only back up to one drive, and stores the backups as images.\nYou probably be better off in this instance with Carbon Copy Cloner, a more granular set up is possible there.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone 5 say that I've used it for a few hours, when in reality I've only used it for a few minutes? The battery life of my iPhone 5 became so bad that it would be dead before I got back from work. So I went and bought an iPhone SE. Because I didn't migrate everything over, I've been using them side by side ever since.\nEven though I'm barely using the iPhone 5, it's draining the battery much faster than the iPhone SE. I decided to change the battery of the iPhone 5, mostly because I wanted to learn how to do it, but even with the new battery things are only slightly improved.\nI charge the phones over night, so they are both at 100% when I leave the flat in the morning. Then at some point in the day when my iPhone SE has 80% battery left, the iPhone 5 has 40% battery left. This is with the new battery.\nI've analysed the battery usage and disabled all the background activities, that were draining the battery, but the problem persists. The most worrying thing is that it reports that I've been using it for several hours, when I've only been using it for a few minutes.\nDoes anyone know why this happens and how I can fix it?\n\nA: Check your charging cord. The \"time since last full charge\" implies it was taken off charge that many hours ago. Possibly because the charging cable became disconnected or is failing.\nThen of course you can try a factory reset of the phone, after a full backup. If it works then try restoring from your backup. I know this can be a bit of trouble.\nBut honestly an iPhone 5 battery, if original, is likely to be at the end of its life. Try replacing the battery before getting rid if the phone.\n\nA: I would download the application Coconut Battery to compare the battery amp hours and condition for each phone. Perhaps the 5's battery you replaced wasn't OEM. This handy free app will tell you the mac or iDevice's battery capacity and cycle count..\n", "Q: AppleScript find the user's set default browser? I've been doing some research on this topic but it seems Apple has changed their file hierarchy. From the MacScripter post \"Get user default browser\" it references the line:\n set pListpath to (path to preferences as Unicode text) & \"com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\"\n\nbut when running the handler in Sierra I'm returned an error that the file is empty.  Further research I found \"How to use an AppleScript app bundle as the default browser in os x?\" and \"Use default browser in custom Apple Script?\" that suggest:\non open location theURL\n ...\nend open location\n\nbut I'm wanting to preserve the browser in a variable to reference later on in my script.  In Sierra is there a file or way to reference what the default browser?\n\nA: For OS X 10.10 and later, use the following example AppleScript code:\nset defaultBrowser to do shell script \"defaults read \\\\\n    ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure \\\\\n    | awk -F'\\\"' '/http;/{print window[(NR)-1]}{window[NR]=$2}'\"\n\nif defaultBrowser is \"\" or defaultBrowser contains \"safari\" then\n    --  # The default Browser is Safari.\n    set defaultBrowser to \"Safari\"\n    --  # Your code goes here.\nelse if defaultBrowser contains \"chrome\" then\n    --  # The default Browser is Google Chrome.\n    set defaultBrowser to \"Google Chrome\"\n    --  # Your code goes here.\nelse if defaultBrowser contains \"firefox\" then\n    --  # The default Browser is Firefox.\n    set defaultBrowser to \"Firefox\"\n    --  # Your code goes here.\nelse\n    set defaultBrowser to \"Other\"\n    --  # Your code goes here.\nend if\n\nNote: The start of the if defaultBrowser statement tests for nothing \"\" as well as \"safari\", because, if Safari is the only Browser installed or if another Browser is installed and has never had a default Browser set, then by default nothing will be returned by the do shell script \"defaults ...\" command, and this means Safari is the default Browser.\nIn the example AppleScript code above, the value of the defaultBrowser variable initially gets set to one of the following values:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nothing: \"\"\n\n*com.apple.safari\n\n*com.google.chrome\n\n*org.mozilla.firefox\n\n*Some other: output\nThen within the if statement, the defaultBrowser gets set to the proper name of the Browser. Although you can certainly modify as needed/wanted.\nAlso note that the do shell script command used herein is more efficient then the other answer, which needlessly uses the plutil command to first convert the binary plist file to an xml plist file and then back to a binary plist file afterwards. It also needlessly uses both grep and awk when both are not necessary since defaults and awk (or just defaults and grep) can do it without all the extra rigmarole.\n\nFor pre OS X 10.10, replace:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure\n\nWith:\ncom.apple.LaunchServices\n\nIn the do shell script \"defaults ...\" command.\n\nA: Correct, the file for has changed to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist.\nI'm running macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), but the script should work with Sierra as well. Please report back.\n# return default browser in macOS\n# https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/313454/applescript-find-the-users-set-default-browser\n# tested with macOS 10.13.3\n\nset default_browser to do shell script \"x=~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist; \\\\\nplutil -convert xml1 $x; \\\\\ngrep 'https' -b3 $x | awk 'NR==2 {split($2, arr, \\\"[><]\\\"); print arr[3]}'; \\\\\nplutil -convert binary1 $x\"\n\nif default_browser is \"org.mozilla.firefox\" then\n    set browser_name to \"Firefox\"\nelse if default_browser is \"com.apple.safari\" then\n    set browser_name to \"Safari\"\nelse\n    set browser_name to \"Probably Google Chrome\"\nend if\n\nThe output will look like this:\n\ncom.apple.safari\norg.mozilla.firefox\n\n", "Q: Restore option-left and option-right in MacOS terminal - What is the action sequence?

Otherwise, it goes goes back to the my original page, when I start the browser.\nI am interested in not just fixing my problem, but in the integrity of my system.\n\nA: A similar situation happened to me this month after a silent upgrade of MRT to version 1.68 (see this blog post for other people reporting the same problem. I'm on macOS 10.11.6.\nAfter rebooting to the recovery partition and disabling SIP, I had deleted MRT.app, but that was not enough; after two weeks it got silently redownloaded and went again into this crazy crashing and respawning cycle. The trick seems to be to uncheck \"Install system data files and security updates\" in the App Store pane of System Preferences to prevent it from being downloaded again.\nSo, I was able to solve this problem with these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot to the recovery partition and disable SIP (csrutil disable), then reboot to your affected system\n\n*If you have a system backup dating from before the silent update of MRT, copy /System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app from this backup to your desktop\n\n3a. Delete the /System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app from your affected system, then put the copy from your backup in its place. It's important to do it in two separate steps apparently.\n3b. If you don't have a backup with a previous version of MRT, you can delete the app (or rename it, it seems to prevent it from being launched.)\n\n\n*In the App Store pane of System Preferences, uncheck \"Install system data files and security updates\"\n\n*Reboot to the recovery partition and reenable SIP (csrutil enable)\n\n\nNote: eventually Apple should release a new, fixed version of MRT, which is actually a malware scanner, so you should eventually go back and check that box in System Preferences, so that the new version can be downloaded and installed. However, it's hard to know when Apple releases the new version as they don't announce MRT updates. The blog linked above is a good resource to stay in the know.\nNote also that if you wish to avoid rebooting twice and do everything from the root Terminal when booted from the recovery partition, the path to MRT.app would be /Volumes/<your boot drive>/System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app (since in that case /System/Library/CoreServices/ it the one from the recovery partition, which in fact does not contain MRT.app at all).\n", "Q: Airplay Yamaha CRX-N560d speakers working on iPad Air 2 but not on Macbook Pro 2017 Good morning everyone.\nI own a Yamaha Net HI-FI, a CRX-N560D that has airplay capabilities.\nI couldn't get my new Macbook Pro 2017 - High Sierra 10.13.3 installed - to stream audio to airplay speakers.\nThe Hi-fi is connected correctly to the router and then to Internet, as it streams Spotify flawlessly.\nI had the same problem with my old Macbook Air late 2010 with every OSX i had installed on it, from Snow Leopard till High Sierra.\nThe odd thing is that i could connect easily iPad Air 2 since iOS 10...\nThe firewall is deactivated; no LittleSnitch or similar.

I use a Mac at school which resets all settings once logged out. I would like to automatically set some settings in system preferences.\nI found an answer here which described how to change the natural scrolling behavior in system preferences. Unfortunately, this doesn't help in changing the mouse speed. Additionally, I've noticed that fining the checkbox number in AppleScript is a very hit-or-miss process. Checkbox 1 might activate a checkbox at the bottom of a particular settings page, whereas Checkbox 2 might activate one in the middle somewhere. I feel uncertain whether I'd be able to find out how to change a slider due to this 'randomness.' \nDoes anyone know how to change the slider using GUI scripting?\n\nA: As you've no doubt found out, UI Scripting has its issues and in this particular case, the mouse preferences, the code can vary based on the version of the OS and what type of mouse, thus making it difficult to provide you code that will absolutely work in your use case scenario. To show you, I'll use two examples of code that work for me on my system.\nOn a MacBook Pro with an Apple Magic Mouse under OS X 10.8.6 the following example ApplesScript code changes the value of the Tracking slider:\nif application \"System Preferences\" is running then ¬\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"mouseTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.mouse\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click of radio button 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        set value of slider 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" to 4\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\n\n\nIn a generic mouse scenario, the following example ApplesScript code changes the value of the Tracking Speed slider:\nif application \"System Preferences\" is running then ¬\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"mouseTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.mouse\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set value of slider 3 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" to 4\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\n\n\nThe value range of the Tracking Speed slider is a decimal value between 0 and 9. Note that the value range for the other sliders differ, Double-Click speed is 0 to 10, and Scrolling Speed is  0 to 7. Also note that these ranges may very depending on the OS version and hardware.\nWith System Preferences opened to the Mouse pane, for a generic mouse scenario, use the following line of code in Script Editor to get the properties of the sliders:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get properties of every slider of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n\nYou'll see the minimum/maximum values as well as the value they are currently set to. The later is important to know after you've manually adjusted to your liking and then use in the script to make the changes as wanted.\nNote that with UI Scripting the value of the delay commands may need to be adjusted for your environment and or additional delay commands may be necessary as appropriate.\nAlso note that the example ApplesScript code is coded to first close System Preferences if it's open. This is being done so as not to have to see the events taking place as the graphic dance of some UI Scripting can be distracting.\n\nYou will see the difference between the two versions of example ApplesScript code in the second one, not only does it not have or need the click of radio button ... command, the slider number is different, along with its name. In the first version it's slider 1 and Tracking where as in the second it's slider 3 and Tracking Speed. There is also no tab group in the second version.\nTo address the hit to miss point mentioned in the OP, with the generic mouse scenario there are three sliders, so the following line of code for the tracking speed:\nset value of slider 3 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" to 4\n\nCan be writen as:\nset value of every slider of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" whose name contains \"track\" to 4\n\nNow you don't need to know what number the slider is as it will act on the only one whose name contains \"track\", which in this case will be slider 3. The same concept can apply to other UI elements too.\nYou can also address the slider by its name, e.g.:\nset value of slider \"Tracking Speed\" of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" whose name contains \"track\" to 4\n\nThe same goes for other UI elements that have a name property, in this case e.g., window 1 is also: window \"Mouse\"\n\nNote: The example ApplesScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted. The onus is upon the user to add error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted.\n", "Q: Does a modern MacBook's green \"camera light\" always turn on when the camera is activated? Many people are seen to put strips of tape and other adhesive materials on their MacBook camera in an attempt to thwart any potential hacker from accessing their system and camera. MacBooks have a green \"camera light\" on the right side of the FaceTime camera on the front that seems to turn on when the camera is activated (i.e. the sensor is provided energy and transmits a signal to the motherboard).\nDoes the camera of a modern MacBook require that the green camera light turns on as well? In other words, is the camera light hardwired to the camera in such a way that if the camera is supplied electricity, that itself would enable the camera light? This would prevent a hacker from being able to obtain any information from the camera without the user being notified by the green light.\nI've seen this question come up again and again, but no satisfactory/definitive answers were provided. The last time such a question was posted received an answer that linked to a research paper showing that it is possible to activate the camera without activating the camera light—but only on pre-2008 Macs. The answers to another question question come to a similar conclusion. A user did say that there was \"[no] proof that you can do the same in post-2008 laptops,\" but this doesn't prove that the camera light is in fact hard-wired to the camera.\nThe fact that there is no proof for such an important security feature is rather strange. There must have been a group of designers and engineers who created the camera system—surely they would know and would have publicized this perhaps in an Apple support article or in an interview? Or perhaps this could have been discovered in a teardown by a group at iFixit (although I am no electrical engineer), but this doesn't seem to have happened yet. Most importantly, I would expect Apple to tout this as a security feature, but there is no mention of it on their site. Is there really 'no proof' as to whether the camera and camera light is hardwired or not?\n\nA: An article on Forbes.com was talking about Apple warning against the use of camera covers. About halfway through the article, it mentions that the light \"is wired in series with the camera\".\n\nOn some laptops the indicator light can be hacked and turned off. However, as a reader has pointed out to me, Apple has a physical method to ensure the light can not be disabled. It is wired in series with the camera so if you turn off the light, power no longer goes to the camera.\nBut that doesn’t mean MacBook cameras are unhackable—there is no such thing. Why doesn’t Apple simply tell people to use a post it note to cover their camera—or even like some people I know, a piece of opaque tape?\nOr better still, why doesn’t Apple build its own webcam cover into MacBooks? The firm is certainly not shy of bringing out new designs, especially ones that help improve privacy. It’s a small hardware change that could make a massive difference.\n\n\nA: Another source, this time directly from Apple, suggests that it is not possible to enable the camera without turning the indicator on. The quote (emphasis mine):\n\nWe design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information. Our products and features include innovative privacy technologies and techniques designed to minimize how much of your data we — or anyone else — can access. And powerful security features help prevent anyone except you from being able to access your information.\nThe FaceTime HD camera built into your Mac computer is designed with your privacy in mind and uses a camera indicator light that glows green when the camera is active. So you will always know when the camera is on.\nThe camera is engineered so that it can’t activate without the camera indicator light also turning on. This is how you can tell if your camera is on.\n\nSource\n\nA: \nThere must have been a group of designers and engineers who created the camera and camera light system – they would surely know and have told others.\n\nJohn Gruber received an email from one such former Apple engineer:\nhttps://daringfireball.net/2019/02/on_covering_webcams\n\nSecurity researchers at Johns Hopkins released a paper in 2013 revealing that the indicator lights on Macs released prior to 2008 could be circumvented by software. I linked to this in 2016, wondering if the same exploit was possible on more recent Macs. Here’s an answer I received from a former engineer at Apple who was intimately familiar with the software drivers for Mac webcams:\n\nThe original cameras had the problem that the JHU researchers detailed in the article that your linked to. Problem was that the firmware was downloaded on every boot and there was no security/encryption mechanism for verifying it. The part used was fairly common and the firmware was just in RAM (hence the loading after a cold boot), as oppose to flashed.\nAll cameras after that one were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]\nSo, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.\n\nThe still photo problem — where the light only turns on for the instant the image is being captured — is interesting. But I would wager real money that the camera indicator light cannot be circumvented by software on any Mac released this decade.\n\nemphasis mine\n", "Q: iPhone 6 discharging instead of charging I have an iPhone 6.

The HDD has Windows 7 installed on it.\n\nA: Unfortunately, A1286 is not enough information to identify which particular MacBook Pro model you're using, as that's the part number for the 15\" unibody case, not the computer.  All non-Retina 15\" MacBook Pros made between late 2008 and mid-2012 carry this number.\nHowever, it's a good bet that the model you have cannot boot anything from USB other than the MacOS itself.  Since these models have optical drives, the only Apple-supported way to install Windows on them was to do so from a Windows DVD, and thus the firmware didn't support Windows USB install sticks.\nSince you're trying to boot KillDisk, I'm guessing you want to destroy the drive for the purposes of selling or junking the laptop.  Fortunately, you have several options available to you:\nOption 1:  Boot the machine to Internet Recovery and use Disk Utility to wipe the drive.  This is only supported on 2010 models and later.  You can access it by holding down CTRL+Option+R immediately after hitting the power button.  This is the option with the least amount of hassle if your Mac supports it.\nOption 2:  Extract the drive from the computer and place it into another computer (PC or Mac doesn't matter), and use whatever tool you want to wipe the drive.  Unlike Retina 2012 and newer Mac models, the hard drive in yours is easily removable.  This is the option with the least amount of hassle if you're comfortable with opening up the computer's case and handling components.\nOption 3:  You can make a bootable MacOS USB drive.  You'll need another Mac to do this, of course.  But you'll be able to use Disk Utility to wipe the drive once you've booted from it.\nOption 4: Connect to another Mac with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable and boot the machine into Target Disk Mode by holding down the T key immediately after hitting the power button.  The computer will then show up as a removable drive on the other Mac, and you can use Disk Utility from there to wipe the drive. This one is probably the most problematic unless you've got a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable lying around (probably not).\n\nJust FYI, The \"boot chime\" is one of the defining characteristics of a Mac, and has been present in every model ever made until Apple (curiously) got rid of it in their 2016 and later models.  You should be hearing the chime as soon as you hit the power button, before the OS begins loading.  The only reason you wouldn't hear it would be if the volume were all the way down and the setting was saved that way in the P-RAM.  But the fact that you can't hear it shouldn't affect your ability to use the various startup keys that Macs understand.\nYou can reset the P-RAM to the defaults by holding down Command+Option+P+R immediately after hitting the power button and you should be able to hear the chime again.  I would recommend doing this anyway, because if you're selling it, the buyer would expect to hear it.\n", "Q: messages keeps asking for password for jabber account Apple messages keeps asking for password every time I try to log in to my jabber account.\nThe password is correctly saved in the keychain (in fact I just go and copy it from there each time). Save Password to Keychain is of course always checked.\nI can not find Keychain First Aid in High Sierra, it seems it has been removed. I tried creating a new login keyring, removing the jabber account and re-adding it (both from Messages and from System Preferences). I also tried adding imagent and Messages.app to the authorized applications list for that Keychain entry (as suggested here).\nThe only weird thing I encountered is that when the problem started I had two entries in keychain for that password. Now I only have one, no matter what I do.\nI also tried resetting messages by renaming away ~/Library/Messages but this led to a \"message database is upgrading, please try again later\" prompt.\nIt seems that while creating a new account saves the password in the keychain as it should, Messages fails to read it. \n\nA: I get the same error. Here is my fix\nOpen Keychain Access\nSearch for com.apple.account.jabber.password\nDouble click it to open the attributes prompt\nIn the \"Account\" field iMessage feed automatically   \"xxx.xxx@gmail.com@talk.google.com\"\nReplace all text in that field with only \"xxx.xxx@gmail.com\"\nClick Save Changes\n\nA: This solution worked for me:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/32744059#32744059\n\nAfter running a comparison with a working version (on Sierra 10.12.6) it looks like the solution (at least for me) is to change the Where value that gets generated on sign in from what gets populated when adding an account in High Sierra com.apple.account.jabber.password to Jabber\nIn order to make this change follow these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Keychain Access\n  \n*Search for com.apple.account.jabber.password\n  \n*Double click it to open the attributes prompt\n  \n*In the Where field (fourth one down) you should see com.apple.account.jabber.password\n  \n*Replace all text in that field with Jabber\n  \n*Click Save Changes\n  \n  \n  After making this change the first launch of messages asked me to allow permission to access keychain. After doing so any subsequent open of messages works as expected.\n\n\nA: I had same problem repeatedly. When I looked into the Jabber keychain attributes, I selected \"show password\" and saw that the stored password was incorrect... a very old password that I had used on that account a few years ago. I manually updated it to use the current correct password, and now the problem seems to have disappeared. It seems that the password that I had been typing upon launching Messages app in wasn't being written to the keychain, so at least manually updating the password works around the problem.\n", "Q: Gave daughter my macbook pro and 6plus for college & she is getting msgs etc under my name. What to do? I gave my daughter my macbook pro and my older 6plus for college/ seemingly still knows me because she is getting msg photo library etc for me. Was it not wiped totally? Help please. I do still see two iphones when my devices are listed.\n\nA: At a minimum you will need to make sure both devices are completely signed out of iCloud.  This will require your daughter knowing your iCloud password if she is not close by enough for you to do it.  I would recommend changing it immediately after if you do tell her.\nPersonally I would also do an Erase All Contents and Settings on the iPhone and a clean install on the MacBook Pro as well.\n", "Q: How can one use /etc/paths.d to add a path with spaces in it to $PATH? I recently installed VMware Fusion 10 on a Mac running macOS 10.12.6. After doing so, my bash PATH is broken.  I traced the problem to a /etc/paths.d path file that Fusion installed; it contains the following entry (with no newline):\n/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public\nNote the space in the pathname.  With this present, on starting a shell I get an error:\n-bash: export: `Fusion.app/Contents/Public:/Library/TeX/texbin': not a valid identifier\n\nAnd my resulting PATH is corrupted.  I tried adding a newline, putting the path in double-quotes, and putting a backslash before the space; all of these produce an error (sometimes different errors).  For example, adding the backslash or wrapping with double-quotes gives the same error.  Both changes together gives:\n-bash: test: /Users/loredo/Library/Commands:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Applications/VMware: binary operator expected\n-bash: test: /Users/loredo/Library/Commands:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Applications/VMware: binary operator expected\n-bash: test: /usr/local/var/rbenv/shims:/Users/loredo/Library/Commands:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Applications/VMware: binary operator expected\n-bash: export: `Fusion.app/Contents/Public:/Library/TeX/texbin:.:/usr/texbin:/usr/local/cuda/bin': not a valid identifier\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if path_helper may be unable to handle such a use case.  Is there a way to handle this?\n\nA: So I'll try and give this one the ol college attempt.  So after messing around with this for about an hour I came to the conclusion that path_helper - the native app that constructs a PATH environment variable from /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d doesn't play well with paths that have spaces in them, ie. thus why you're experiencing your current situation.\nSo my hacky solution to get this working, is to create a symlink from,\n\n/Applications/VMware Fusion.app\n\nto\n\n/Applications/VMwareFusion.app\n\nusing the below command,\n\nln -sf /Applications/Vmware Fusion.app /Applications/VmwareFusion.app\n\nThen edit /etc/paths.d/com.vmware.fusion.public and change the one line in that file to look like the below,\n\n/Applications/VMwareFusion.app/Contents/Public/\n\nThen obviously start a new shell session or reinit.\nThis solution works great for me using the fish shell.\n\n\nA: My /etc/paths.d/com.vmware.fusion.public contains:\n /Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public\n\nIn Terminal, echo $PATH outputs:\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public\n\nI have no problem with my PATH or executing e.g. vmrun, which is in the /Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public directory, so having the space is not an issue. Your PATH is being messed up elsewhere!\nHave you modified /etc/paths or have you added a ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile, and if so are you modifying the PATHin any of these files?\n", "Q: Running an iOS Emulator on Mac I can't seem to find any updated (or reliable) sources of iOS emulators for Mac, I am running Sierra.\nAt first I believed that in Xcode, when I went to run my app, was running an emulator, but I was mistaken. I guess it's a simulator. The difference is they have different compatibilities, so if you take an .ipa (iOS app) file and install it onto the Simulator, the app will crash.\nMy question is are there any iOS emulators out there where I can install real apps from the App Store, or from an .ipa file.\n\nA: There is a recently announced service Corellium that offers virtualised cloud instances of iOS.  It's not publicly available yet though and no word of how much it will cost.  I'm not aware of any way of running them on your desktop though other than the Xcode simulator.\nIt is the kind of thing I imagine Apple would have been quick to clamp down on in the past although there is lots of talk about the two app stores converging in the near future so who knows what will happen.\nSee these links for more info on that:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/21/apple-cross-platform-apps-opinion/\n\n*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps\nUPDATE:\nApparently a number of researchers have had varying degrees of success booting iOS in QEMU.  Here is an article providing a guide on getting iOS 12 to the point of launchd and recoveryd running:\nhttps://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/\nIn it's current state it will not allow you to run apps but very interesting none the less and worth keeping an eye as Corellium still appears to be invite only.\nUPDATE 2:\nApple is attempting to slowly destroy Corellium. The user daeken on Twitter has been developing an emulator for iOS simulator on macOS that they have stated they are close to releasing (May 2020) though, but will be a commercial product.  They appear to have put in a huge amount of work and have demonstrated a number of apps working on it.\n\nA: First off, iOS emulators don’t really exist. The problem is that iOS is closed source. On the other hand, Android emulators exist due to android being open source. So, since Apple has not released its own emulator, it is quite unlikely that a true iOS emulator will exist as of now. \n\nA: On your Mac terminal, type the following:\nopen /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/\n\nIt will open an iOS simulator that allows you to select which specific iOS device you want to emulate.  This works in the latest versions of Mac (I'm using High Sierra).\n", "Q: Seriously corroded Macintosh Color Classic I just got my hands on a 1993 color classic to try and repair. The machine turns on (I hear the fan) and emits three monotone beeps. Not the chimes of death, but something I can’t figure out. I busted out the logic board, and wow. There was some serious corrosion. I tried to clean it up with some isopropyl alcohol and cotton balls, but some resistors totally fell off and I can see connectors that are completely worn through. I’ve attached some photos. What should I do? I only see one really leaky cap. Should I try dishwashing it? I’ve heard of this method but I don’t know how to go about I to without a. ruining my dishwasher or b. ruining the board. Any suggestions would be very welcome!\n\n\n\nA: I suspect @Allan is right, and the board is too far gone to salvage. But if you want to gamble on further damage vs. possible resurrection, there at least one thing you can try.\nIt looks to me like that was area around the the battery that has most of the damage; the battery probably leaked (acid or alkaline, depending on the type) and corroded everything around it. The corrosion is basically irreversible, but you can at least try to remove the acid/alkali. Alcohol won't do a good job of this, it takes a polar solvent like water. The problem is that water can also accelerate the corrosion, so you have to do it carefully. Note: read all of these instructions before starting, and get all the tools ready in advance.\nTools: a sink, a old soft-bristle toothbrush, compressed air (something like this, not the high-pressure stuff you'd find in a machine shop), paper towels, a hair dryer or heat gun, and some uncooked rice for final drying.\n\n*\n\n*Use running water. Turn a tap on low (you don't want it to splash). Hold the board with the damaged corner tilted down, so the water runs toward it and off the board, not toward the undamaged sections. Let the water run on where the battery was, so it runs across the damaged section. Move the board around a bit, so the whole damaged area gets washed.\n\n\n*Use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the components and traces as the water runs across them. Try to get especially between the tiny wires on the components. Don't push too hard; the wires will be weak, and you don't want to tear anything loose! Rinse the toothbrush out periodically so you aren't grinding crud into the things you're trying to clean. When you're done with this process, throw the toothbrush out; you don't ever want it near your mouth again!\n\n\n*When you're done brushing, rinse that corner of the board for a little bit longer.\n\n\n*Now take the board out from under the water, and use the compressed air. Blow mostly across the board (not straight down), and toward the damaged corner. You need to blow out under the components (and maybe the corroded-looking end of the SIMM socket), and you don't want to blow any of the crud into the clean section of the board. If possible, blow air out through the connectors at the back of the board as well.\n\n\n*Now rinse the board again. Repeat the rinse & blow cycle a couple of times to clean out better under components and inside the connectors.\nWhen you're done washing, you want to dry the board as quickly and completely as possible. The water is both washing crud off, and accelerating corrosion while the board is wet. Once you're done rinsing, the water is hurting more than it helps!\n\n\n*Gently pat-dry it with a paper towel, then use the compressed air to blow-dry it a final time (same tactics as before, to blow water out from under things). Get the entire board this time, in case any water splashed onto the undamaged section. Similarly, get the bottom side of the board in case any water got there.\n\n\n*Now use a hair dryer or heat gun to continue drying the board. You probably want the low setting; you want to dry it, not cook it.\n\n\n*When you get bored with the hair dryer, switch to rice. You want to basically submerge the board in dry rice (see figure 2 here) and leave it there at least overnight. If there's any remaining battery gunk there, it'll hang onto the water longer than you expect, so be patient. When you're done with this, throw out the rice; like the toothbrush, it should be considered contaminated.\n\n\n*Finally, when you're confident it's fully dry, reinstall it any try powering it back up. Without a battery, it may not work right on the first try; IIRC those old Macs get a dead-looking black screen on first boot with a dead battery, but will come up if you turn them off & right back on (assuming everything else is ok).\nDo not apply power before you're confident it's all dry. Power will greatly accelerate the damage that water does, so it's better to be patient.\n", "Q: How to create bootable flash drive from macOS High Sierra combo update I have problem installing macOS High Sierra from App Store.

It was always troublesome on my Windows PC, so I was disappointed to see it wasn't working very well on my new MBP 2017 13\" w/ TB as well. The installer ran fine, but upon reboot the progress bar seemed to hang. I never reached the login prompt. A macOS update was pending and was waiting for a reboot, my iPad was plugged in and the MBP was on charge.\nAnyway, I proceeded to contact Duet's support email, with them telling me to boot into Safe Mode (so I can delete the file duetdisplay.kext from /Library/Extensions), but my Mac won't even boot to Safe Mode; it seems to hang again. I never reached the login prompt, again. I'm thinking that reinstalling might be my only option, or removing the file manually via the Terminal in Recovery. \nWhat are my options?\n\nA: I've just encountered the same problem on my 15\" 2016 MacBook Pro  running macOS 10.14.2 Mojave. While I expected it to take some time starting up it never came back to the login screen and here's how I solved the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into single user mode by pressing the cmd + s keys on\nstartup. Note this not safe mode, it's single user mode.\n\n*Once in single user mode type mount -uw / so that you get write access to the drive.\n\n*Navigate to the kexts directory with cd /Library/Extentions.\n\n*Now delete the Duet Display kexts with sudo rm -Rf DuetDisplay.kext, it's a directory thus the -Rf.\n\n*Next clear caches with sudo rm -Rf /System/Library/Caches/*.\n\n*Finally restart with shutdown -r now.\n\n\nHopefully that helps anyone else with this issue. I'm so disappointed in Duet Display and asking for my money back. It's cost me more in loss of productivity fixing this mess than I hoped to gain using their App.\n\nA: I had the same problem you described above. I was so happy that I found this post, because I almost decided to reinstall my MacbookPro (mid 2018).\nBut I tried it again because I really wanted to use duet. And the second time I installed it, it worked perfectly!\nI had downloaded the latest version (2.0.5.0). When you install it duet asked you to add it to your security. ignore that message en quit the duet app trough activity manager.\nOpen you security and privacy setting in you settings en unlock the settings with the lock left below. Go to you Privacy tab and open duet again. On that moment duet asks again to added to your security. in the accessibility you will see the duet app logo. enable it in your privacy. Then you can restart you mac and this time it will not hang on the loader!\nI hope this will also work for you. I am using duet happily ^^ \n\nA: Just want to add a few things since Mojave and Recovery are substantially different than the old single user mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac with T2 chips you can’t do Ctrl+S anymore.

I tried making multiple sessions of screen recording on two devices, each recording its own screen: iPhone X and iPhone 5S. The result was that recordings on 5S were in several cases shorter than on X, but I didn't explicitly stop the recording in 5S's Control Center.\nUnder which conditions could iOS stop the recording at its own initiative / basing implicitly on what I did?\nI found only \"tapping status bar\" that could stop recording (though it asks for user confirmation); is there anything else?\n\nA: As far as I know, locking the phone (pressing the power button once shortly) will also stop recording.\nJust like anything else, it requires enough free space on your iPhone to save the file. However, that doesn’t sound like the problem in your case.\nThere might be a chance that your iPhone 5S might not fast enough or have enough memory to record as long as your iPhone X. \n\nA: Besides the reasons already mentioned by David E, I also experienced recording stopped when:\n\n\n*\n\n*battery was too low (but long before shutting down)\n\n*overheating and/or overloaded (eg. running screen recording alongside full-resolution foreground dashcam app and still having active third-party turn-by-turn navigation app in background; sometimes with Personal Hotspot enabled)\n\n\nA: When I do screen recording while Playing it’s happens to stop recording.

I'm wondering if anyone knows if there is a way to play one song on speakers, yet a different song through headphones, using a Mac.  I use songs as examples for any given audio.  The way I assume this would work is by having some kind of external device that plugs into the aux port on the Mac, that in turn would have multiple inputs for the aux jack for your speakers and also the headphones/earbud jack, and then you could set your web browser playing YouTube to the speakers and your iTunes to the headphones, or something along those lines.  \nHas anyone heard of anything that would enable you to listen to one song on headphones while the rest of the room listens to another, without interference between the two?\n\nA: You can use a piece of hardware called a MIXER to take two (or more) audio signals, mix them together, and have one OR MORE outputs.  For example: Behringer XENYX Q502USB / Audio interface.  \nThere is a learning curve for operating a mixer (where to plug in the sound source / what cables to use), but if you want to take recording to the next level, you might enjoy getting a mixer.\n", "Q: Unable to download purchased apps because cloud symbol missing on some apps in itunes I am usually backing all apps which I purchase.

Now the problems are gone but my preferences are also gone. Luckily I have copied the folder before doing so. Thus if I knew which of the preferences needed replacement by the Sierra ones I could restore the rest by hand. Any idea?\n\nA: It will be very difficult to isolate the issue to individual preference files, since there could be several subtle issues.\nBetter to take the opposite approach - start with no preferences and only copy the old preferences over one by one as you come across them. That is, as you discover that you have a preference that needs updating, find the single preference file that will give you that preference, and restore it. Re-test and only proceed if things are still stable. Will be a drawn out process, but necessarily so I think. When you can no longer add individual preferences, consider the restoration finished and many set the remaining preferences.\nThis complex relationship between the OS, Applications and user files is why Apple created Migration Assistant. It might not be help here but it is useful to know just how intricate the process is of \"migrating\" from one OS version to another.\n\nA: I am going to go out on limb and say that Apple never intended users to downgrade an OS in place like you’re attempting. You’re basically being your own test pilot which could be seen as either very brave or very foolish. I would suggest that what you’re attempting is not only more trouble than it’s worth, you may never get the results you desire. That’s because even if you could resolve this particular problem it’s more than likely you’re going to encounter something else that blows up in your face eventually. Similarly as others have suggested, assuming you have alternate storage, copy your files and your Library directory from your homedir and start with a clean install of Sierra. Reinstall your apps, use time machine to snapshot the system, and then attempt to restore various settings by manually copying the respective plist files for apps that the you are confident are reverse compatible and making new backups of your system up along the way. If you wind up hosing things with your manual recombobulation of your system, just restore to the last known good state and try try again.\nIf you cannot get the system stable enough to copy your files, use a bootable thumb drive like an installer which can be built following one of the many guides on creating installation thumb drives. Once booted, open a terminal window, attach the external storage, mounted it, and rsync your files.\nProbably not what you were hoping for, but I think cutting your losses and not succumbing to the sunk-cost fallacy will end up saving you time. Good luck!\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue (including downgrading from high sierra). I took a slightly different approach to the OP and took all files containing the word \"apple\" in my Preferences directory and stored them in a separate directory \"Maybe_Bad\". I then went to my last Sierra backup (which sadly was all the way back in August 2017 because I'm on the beta program for OS X) and copied across all the apple files in that backup's Preferences directory. Also, I copied across the old ~library/Messages folder because High Sierra uses a different database for Messages than Sierra (and because of that by the time we're done you'll have lost all messages while in High Sierra). That finally got Messages working and also stopped the constant crashing of identityservicesd and callservicesd. Then slowly I started adding back all the apple preference files in Maybe_Bad (restarting between batches of copies) until I started getting the crashing again. Now the process got a little muddy after a while because of all the back and forthing of potentially problematic files.\nI just assumed any preferences containing \"ichat\" or \"messages\" needed to be the original Sierra files. In the end I think I narrowed it down to the following causing the problems:\ncom.apple.coreservices.appleidauthenticationinfo.*\nand \ncom.apple.facetime* (also FaceTime*)\nNow I just wish there was a way to export and import messages within Messages.\n\nA: Thanks, MickM: that provided me the impetus I needed to finally correct that problem on my Mac Pro Sierra server. I had made the mistake of simply accepting the High Sierra upgrade, and when I backed it out ofter seeing how much was broken, it left me with no Messages or iCloud sync and with (literally) gigabytes of log junk about crashing identitysrvicesd and callservicesd. After reinstalling Sierra several times, deleting my iCloud account several times, ripping out ~/Library/Messsages several times, rebooting many dozens of times, and trashing the plists mentioned by the OP several times, I found your post. When I finally deleted the facetime plists, and also in a fit of disgust deleted all the identityservices plists (to let Sierra recreate them cleanly), I was finally able to get it working again.\nI don't really care that much about iMessage, but the cloud sync is important to my business- and any Unix system that is generating that much log stuff is seriously sick. It is clear that Apple didn't intend for anyone to back out of that transition... I've now created the files in Applications (\"Install MacOS High Sierra.app\" and \"Install MacOS High Sierra.appdownload\", both chmod'ed a-rwx) to keep the App Store from nagging me about High Sierra on any of our machines. Think I'll stay put where I am.\nAnyway, thanks for the info. And before anyone else jumps on me: I don't recommend this course of action for anyone who doesn't know exactly what they are doing. It worked for me; but you do this sort of thing at your own risk, with many redundant backups ready at hand. Your mileage may vary.

2015-MBP @16GB Ram. To me it appears possible, that my system never ran 100% stable, but I blamed a combination of USB-2xRJ45-Adaptor and VMWare Fusion - until the freezes of my system made it impossible to work. \nI ran the Apple-Diagnostic-Tool (d boot), stating the system is fine. However, memtest86 (usb Boot stick) eventually crashes at #13-Hammer-Test with cannot start CPU2. \nTo me it appears to be an escalated hardware issue, probably existing since beginning \nWould the two of you be so kind and report, how your issues “turned out” or what the final diagnosis on your systems was? \nThank you a lot.\nCheers from Berlin. \n", "Q: \"Play/Pause\" button on remote does nothing, Apple TV 4K The \"Play/Pause\" button in the lower left corner of the remote control for the Apple TV 4K has no effect. Previously it stopped and started videos playing in apps such as Netflix. \nWorkaround: Clicking the physical button under the touch surface stops and starts the playing of videos.\nIs there a feature, some setting, that may be altering this button’s behavior?\nI am on the Apple’s beta channel for this Apple TV. Could this be some new feature in tvOS 11.3 beta recently installed?\n\nA: Thankfully they have just fixed this issue.

I still get a Kernal Panic every now and then and it's worrying.  \nI've attached a pastebin link with the Problem Report that generated.\nKernal Panics Macbook Pro retina - [link]pastebin.com/f2UhbLMH)\n\nA: Usually kernel issues are related to software but they can also be caused by bad hard drives. I would boot the Mac into recovery mode (turn mac on, hold down \"command\" + R until you see the Apple Logo. And then go to Disk Utility and run a First Aid on your Macintosh HD hard drive (do all hard drives anyway just to make sure). If it passes then try reinstalling macOS (OS X).

I also noted that some manpages are outdated and incomplete (for example pmset is from 2012, lacking some details).\nHowever I do have some manpages via MacPorts (e.g. OpenSSL(1)).\nI have these paths in /private/etc/man.conf:\nMANPATH /usr/share/man\nMANPATH /usr/local/share/man\nMANPATH /usr/X11/man\n\n(the latter two are non-existent), and these in /private/etc/manpaths:\n/usr/share/man\n/usr/local/share/man\n\n(the latter again non-existent).\n", "Q: On Apple TV, What does signing in with my TV provider and allowing apps to access the subscription actually do? I thought the idea was that i could go into the Apple TV settings app and sign in with my TV provider, so that I would not need to sign into into apps individually. \nWhat i find is that even after an app asks for permission to access my TV subscription, I am still required to go to another device, navigate to a URL, and sign in with my TV provider password. \nIs this working right?\n\nA: Source:\nAccording to Apple, not all providers or apps support single sign-on. As you've already discovered, sometimes you need to sign-in to an app separately.  This isn't just with Apple TV; I have a Roku and it does the same thing.\nNormally, I would paste the names of the TV providers and apps that support SSO.  However, this list is very long and often changes so posting them here doesn't make sense.  Instead, I'll post the links to Apple's site that contain the lists.  That way, it should always be up-to-date.\n\n\n*\n\n*List of TV providers that support SSO\n\n*List of apps that support SSO\nHere's how to see a list of supported apps by provider on your Apple TV:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store.\n\n*Choose the Featured tab.\n\n*Scroll down and look for either an icon called TV Providers or an icon of your specific TV provider. Select the icon to see apps that support single sign-on. The list of supported apps might update as apps add support for single sign-on.\n\n", "Q: \"Put Display to Sleep\" with no fade out time I've just upgraded from Mavericks to ElCaptain (yes, I'll avoid entering in details why…).

Even though the CPU usage is 12%, CPU package power draw maxes out at 31W. I checked the clock speeds and temperatures from iStat Menus. The CPU core power draw was only 7W at maximum and integrated GPU power draw was at 21W. \nMy Question: How do I fix this?\n\n\n\nAdditional information:\nBut GPU frequency was at 0MHz. When I use apps like Macs Fan Control that only displays temperatures as numbers not graphs, temperatures don't rise. Also, when using Intel Power Gadget, temperatures keep rising up to 92°. And when I close the lid of my Mac, it overheats, exceeding the CPU temperature limit and crashes. But when using iStat Menus, temperatures hover around 70°.\n\nA: Fixed it! Driver issue. I was using an older version.\n", "Q: Why doesn't HandOff work when connected to VPN and is there a way to go around it?

It seems to require both Bluetooth and Wifi. I guess Bluetooth is being used for the transfer itself while Wifi is used to check connection to iCloud.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681\n\nA: I contacted ExpressVPN support and got some answers.\n\n\n*\n\n*They have a security feature that prevents port forwarding between different devices connected independently to the VPN\n\n*A solution would be to connect both devices (mac and iPhone) to the router and connect the router directly to the VPN, in this way both devices share the same connection and can \"see\" each other\n\n\nA: It depends on your provider, but I found that Mullvad’s app has a \"Local network\" toggle that immediately enables Handoff for me.\n\n", "Q: é showing up as &eacute in TextEdit I am opening a text file using Mac's TextEdit that has &eacute; in it. &eacute; is supposed to be showing up as é instead.\nIs there a way to make TextEdit read it as é?\n\nA: &eacute; is one of the HTML forms of é and when &eacute; is pasted as plain text...

This setup is supposed to enable Fast Charging of the iPhone X.\nHowever, always when plugging in the iPhone X to this setup, the phone gives a way the \"charging\" sound notification twice. Is this normal behaviour?\nI don't get the double sound notification when plugging in via normal Lightning-to-USB-A to another 12W adapter, nor when connecting the phone with a Mac.\nI'm thinking the second sound notification may have something to do with switching over to Fast Charge, but I haven't been able to find a definite answer. Or perhaps some component is faulty?\nThis thread (external link) has people asking the same thing:\nhttps://forums.imore.com/iphone-x/396144-fast-charge-apple-ac-adapter-cable-double-sound.html\n\nA: Yes, when fast charging iPhone gives the charging sound (\"Ding\") notification twice. And definitely you will not get sound notification twice when you have used the 12W iPad charger.\n12W Charger => The downside is that while it’s faster than the brick that comes with your phone, it’s still not quite the true quick charging speed that a USB-C brick should offer. Simply you could not get the true fast charging. But it is better than what comes with the box.\n29W Charger => Apple isn’t saying what the maximum fast charging speed is for the new phones — only that it achieved those fast charging results with its 29W, 61W, and 87W USB-C chargers for the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros. These chargers offer the best fast charging power where you hear the charging sound twice.\nReferences : (EasyAcc, 2017), (Apple Inc., 2017) , (The Verge, 2017).\n\nA: The double chime is definitely a bug rather than a feature. it's caused by the switch from regular charging speed to the fast charging speed. when the power adapter takes too long to make the switch (I guess we're talking about 10s or 100s of milliseconds), the iphone thinks it got disconnected and reconnected again.\nThat explains why some chargers cause iphones to make a double chime and some don't. Mine is a 3rd party charger and I've never had a double chime on my iphone 11, even though I'm 100% sure it's double charging (I connected it through a wattage meter and I can clearly see that the switch from 5W to 18W happens)\nedit: you can refer to this video (not mine, but underlines what I just wrote)\n", "Q: Can I run windows 10 on my MacBook Air via bootcamp without paying for a windows license? I am interested in running windows 10 on my mac via apple's Boot Camp. I plan to follow the instructions laid out on this website: https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/23/how-to-install-windows-10-mac-boot-camp-assistant-partition-video/. \nIf I download the windows 10 iso file from microsoft, can I run windows without paying for a license? Does Microsoft allow you to run an unlicensed version windows? I have found conflicting information online and I don't want to start this process until I'm sure that I can use windows' without paying.\nP.S. I only plan to use the Windows partition for ARCgis so it would be a shame to pay for a windows license just to use one software.\n\nA: You can legally install and run Windows 10 (But not Windows 8.1 or earlier) as a trial up to 90 days on your Macbook Air with less personalization features, an “Activate Windows” watermark at the right bottom and some reminders about activating Windows time to time. Only thing you have to do is to download an ISO from Microsoft from this link (make sure to choose 64-bit) and use Bootcamp to install Windows as usual. During installation, when you are asked for a license key, there will be a button at the bottom of the window (not really sure about position), which says “I don’t have a license key” or something similar. Press it and choose the type of Windows you want to install if asked. You will be installing Windows 10 trial if you have followed this correctly, but there is no legal way to use it for free forever with all features.\nIf you are installing Windows just to run one application, try Winebottler for macOS first.\n\nA: \nIf I download the windows 10 ISO file from Microsoft, can I run\n  windows without paying for a license?\n\nNo.  You legally must acquire a valid license.  However, you can download a trial version that you can use to test out Windows 10 for a period of up to 90 days.\nFrom the Microsoft Windows 10 Terms of Use:\n\nYou are authorized to use this software only if you are properly\n  licensed and the software has been properly activated with a genuine\n  product key or by other authorized method.

You can also activate the software manually\n  by Internet or telephone. In either case, transmission of certain\n  information will occur, and Internet, telephone and SMS service\n  charges may apply. During activation (or reactivation that may be\n  triggered by changes to your device’s components), the software may\n  determine that the installed instance of the software is counterfeit,\n  improperly licensed or includes unauthorized changes. If activation\n  fails, the software will attempt to repair itself by replacing any\n  tampered Microsoft software with genuine Microsoft software.

If the startup disk is copied in its entirety to an external drive, can that external drive then be used as a startup disk? \n\nA: Yes you can you can use disk utilty to clone the contents of one drive to another but  you can also use Carbon Copy Cloner.\nYou cannot use an external disk as startup disk if you drag and drop the system files as the permissions on the files might change leading to unbootable external disk.\nSo do not drag and drop the system files, only clone the disk into another disk as it preserves all the file attributes, permissions, owner, group, etc.\nYou can use Disk utilty 'Restore' feature to clone a drive.

It has nothing to do with the airline, whether it is accepted or not depends upon the airport, not the airline.  But that is besides the point, the question is how do you physically add a boarding pass to Apple Wallet.  American Airlines sends an email to you which contains a link to your boarding pass.  American further advises you to add the pass, that appears after you have followed that link, to your Apple Wallet. The procedure should be to open Wallet, click on the + sign in the top right corner and then position the boarding pass within the box in Wallet until Wallet clicks and records the boarding pass. Unfortunately, nothing seems to happen. You never get to that \"click\" and the question is why?  I agree with the person who posted this question earlier: it should be easy, so why isn't it?\n\nA: After you make the check-in online (either via the app or the website), the American Airlines app allows you to add the boarding pass to you wallet from inside the app (it's in effect the last step of the check-in).\n\nBut if you have a \"generic\" boarding pass you can try with this site:\nhttps://ahoy.io/getpassbook/\n", "Q: What is the definitive iPhone X corner radius? I've been experimenting and have found no conclusive corner radius for the iPhone X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some sources, such as iPhone X Screen Demystified - PaintCode, say its 40pts.\n\n*Some say it's 44, like UI Design for iPhone X: Top Elements and the Notch - Max Rudberg.\n\n\nUsing Xcode, I created a circle with a width and length of 80 (so radius 40), and put it in the top left corner of the iPhone X (so x and y are zero), there is a tiny white gap between the circle and the the edge of the screen, which you can see here:\n\nI also tried another method, doing this with a button:\nbutton.frame.size.height = 812\nbutton.frame.size.width = 375\nbutton.layer.cornerRadius = 40\nbutton.center = self.view.center\n\nWith this I am left with:\n\n\nSo the question is, what is the real corner radius? Or what is going on with Xcode?\n\nA: Brad Ellis has an article detailing the curves on the iPhone X.\n\n[..] iPhone X rounded screen corners don’t use the classic rounding method where you move in a straight line and then arc using a single quadrant of a circle. Instead, the math is a bit more complicated. Commonly called a squircle, the slope starts sooner, but is more gentle.\n\nYou can see the difference here:\n\n\nA: The following Objective-C line\nNSLog(@\"%@\", [self traitCollection]);\n\nexecuted in the iOS 11.0.1 simulator on the iPhone X produces the following output:\n<UITraitCollection: ... _UITraitNameDisplayCornerRadius = 39.000000>\n\nSo it looks like at some point in time, somebody at Apple thought the corner radius was 39 points. I guess that's the most official answer we'll get. :-) But as the other answers explain, that information is not very useful...\nEven more useless information: Some other iOS 11.0 and 11.1 simulators report _UITraitNameDisplayCornerRadius = 0.000000 for iPhones without round corners (e.g. see this SO question), but the simulator for iOS 12.2 does not include the _UITraitNameDisplayCornerRadius property in the log output for UITraitCollection, and neither does a real iPhone X running iOS 11.2.1. I guess they removed this property from the log output in iOS 11.2 or so.\nP.S.: I guess it doesn't matter, but I got these results on Xcode 10.1.\n\nA: The shape of the corners cannot be described as an arc. It can however be reproduced using public API since iOS 11. UIBezierPath.init(roundedRect:cornerRadius:) will create a rectangle with continuous rounded corners.\nSource: https://medium.com/fueled-engineering/continuous-rounded-corners-with-uikit-b575d50ab232\niOS 13 introduced an explicit cornerCurve property on CALayer: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayercornercurve\n\nA: iPhone X corners do not have a conclusive corner radius. They're not normal arcs, they are ‘continuous corners’.\nYou can't replicate these with a simple .cornerRadius, and you also can't use Apple's own continuous corners, since that's a private API.\n\nCALayer on iOS 11 has a private \"continuousCorners\" property, which is what powers many rounded corners in SpringBoard – and likely more! Now I'm jealous.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/argentumko/status/955773459463790592\nThe closest you can get without your own implementation is UIBezierPath's rounded rectangle drawing, which uses _continuousRoundedRectBezierPath.\n", "Q: iCloud Drive Won't Sync on Mac iCloud Drive on my Mac (10.13.3) won't sync.  \n\n\n*\n\n*My other devices perform perfectly, as does icloud.com.

I tried restarting, new user profiles, signing in and out of iCloud, check and unchecking documents in the cloud etc.\nEach time I waited several hours, but my iCloud documents did not appear.\nWhat finally worked was Dwight McKay's suggestion:\nIn the Mac Terminal program (in the Utilities folder), type:\nkillall bird\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\nmv CloudDocs CloudDocsOld # SEE NOTE AT TOP\n\nNOTE: the original instructions required deleting CloudDocs (rm -rf CloudDocs instead of mv). An edit was suggested to move rather than delete the folder, but this has not been tested. If you can confirm that this still works, please leave a comment and I'll remove this note.\nIf everything goes well, then you can delete the CloudDocsOld folder afterwards in Terminal:\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\nrm -rf CloudDocsOld\n\nIf something goes wrong you can recover the CloudDocsOld folder:\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\nrm -rf CloudDocs\nmv CloudDocsOld CloudDocs # SEE NOTE AT TOP\n\ncd = change directory to...\nrm = remove\n-rf = recursive & force deletion of read-only files\nmv = move and rename A to B (SEE NOTE AT TOP)\n\nI had to wait about an hour for file names to show up, and of course the actual files are still in the cloud.\nIt is too technical for me but you can paste the following line into the Terminal to follow sync progress\nbrctl log -w\n\nIt took about 4 hours to go through 300 gb. brctl stopped output when it was done.

My solution proved a bit different, and as I don't fully understand it, I didn't post it.\nMy problem related to the system in question's multiple network interfaces - specifically, two active ethernet connections.  A combination of deleting/recreating the interfaces and the update to macOS 10.13.2 left iCloud functioning correctly, but as I said, I don't really know why.  I'm only clear that some problem with multiple network connections was at the root of it.\n\nA: I had a similar issue to Brian's below -- earlier in the day I had been using iPhone USB for my network, and when I switched to Wifi later on, iCloud would not sync.

Sorry in advance for a lengthy question.\nI have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports.) Since I purchased it in summer 2016 I've used it with a couple of different cheap HD monitors by Samsung, connected with the Apple thunderbolt-VGA multi-adapter.

Suddenly, the external display resolution defaulted to 800x600. The \"scaled\" options in Display preferences now allow for 800x600 and 1280x1024 only. \nOnly by option-clicking the \"scaled\" radio button in Display preferences can I access the monitor's native resolution of 1920x1080 (this has never been necessary before.)\n(and now the meat of the question:) When I do select the full HD resolution, the image is almost correct, but asymmetrically narrowed - leaving a black bar of, I don't know, maybe 120px on the left side and 40px on the right.

Back when the rMBP Late 2013 came out, an article wrote about how it could support 4K@60Hz, but only on Windows because of a driver issue.

The variable here is the computer environment--which is why I am posting my question here and not on Amazon.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: It's not clear whether your concern is around the fact you're running macOS High Sierra or that you're using a 2017 MacBook Pro?\nWhat I can tell you is that I've seen Photoshop Elements 2018 work just fine on Macs running macOS High Sierra. There really shouldn't be any issues, although everyone's system is different because of the software they have installed and external hardware that may be connected.\nHowever, just in case you weren't aware, you can download a trial of Photoshop Elements 2018 to try it out first. I'd do that if you still have any concerns.\n\nA: Photoshop and Illustrator 2018 CC have never once crashed for me on High Sierra on a 2016 MBP i7 with 4gb radeon 460 even when running a lot of different applications while having 10 or so open files in Photoshop, if that's helpful.\n", "Q: Removing emojibubbleshooter chrome notification I have emojibubbleshooter notification on chrome every once in while.\n(https://emojibubbleshooter.com/?utm_source=notif_wct)\nI haven't installed new extensions for few months so I am not sure why I am getting this ad.\nI checked notification tab, and found the following :\n\nWhat is this 'games alert'?

I have an external USB drive and want to encrypt it. I have seen many 'suggestions' on how to do that, but I do not see any option to encrypt the drive. I am using MacOS 10.13.2.\nI have see, for example, this answer. But in step 9, when I right click the drive (on the Desktop or the Finder), there is no option 'encrypt'. Before that I have formatted the drive in the 'Mac OC Extended (Journaled)' format. No option for encryption in the Disk Utility either ...\nSo how to do that? Maybe the option was forgotten in the new OS version?\n\nA: I didn't find a way to do this from Disk Utility, but you can accomplish it from Terminal using diskutil.\nOpen Terminal and run diskutil list to show all devices currently connected. One of the entries should look similar to\n/dev/disk7 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 GB     disk7\n   1:                  Apple_HFS LOGBOOK                 1.0 GB     disk7s1\n\nwith the name of your USB stick instead of LOGBOOK. Take note of the device shown in the first line.\nThen run\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ NEWNAME GPT /dev/diskWHATEVER-NUMBER-YOURS-IS\n\nto erase all content and create the required partition scheme. Replace NEWNAME with whatever name you want to use (enclose in \"\" if it contains anything else than letters) and use the device number found above.\nOnce done you can encrypt in Finder by right-clicking on the stick name in the sidebar.\n", "Q: Can I back up the saved WiFi passwords on my Mac? Too frequently my Mac connects to WiFi but can’t access the Internet on cafes (my iPhone works properly). It has been tormenting me for over a year and I tried everything I found on the web but still could not resolve it. So I finally want to reset the WiFi settings.\nHowever, if I reset the WiFi settings on my Mac, it erases all the saved WiFi passwords I connected on cafes, which have more than 500. It is not what I want to do to ask each password again whenever I enter the cafes again, so I rather want to back it up and restore whenever I want.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: \nAll WiFi passwords are stored in Keychain.\nSo you need to make a backup of the keychain folder.\nLocation:\n~/Library/Keychains/\n\n", "Q: Should I turn off external monitor when MacBook sleeps? I have a MacBook Pro. When I'm not using it - at lunch time and overnight - I put the MBP to sleep. This in turns sends the external monitor to sleep. However, should I be turning the external monitor off?\nWill this save energy, money and the life span of the monitor - or the opposite?\nEDIT\nFurther info. One of the reasons why I'm hesitate about turning the monitor off while the MacBook is asleep, is in the monitor installation instructions it states:\n\"Turn on the monitor first, then the computer. This sequence is very important.\"\nIt's not clear if this is just refering to the first time set up or if this sequence should be observed for ever.\nI guess if I turn off the monitor while the MacBook sleeps, I could then follow the following sequence: turn monitor on, then wake MacBook.\nAny thoughts?\nSECOND EDIT\nI've just checked the monitor Specifications. Bizarrely it says sleep mode used 0.5W and Off mode also uses 0.5W !!\n\nA: With modern monitors that have a \"soft touch\" power button they don't completely remove power from the monitor and draw zero current like say a traditional light switch. Part of the power supply keeps running to run some digital circuitry (normally a small microcontroller) that determines when the monitor should be taken out of sleep / off mode because either the button was pressed or a video signal is detected.\nThat would be why the specifications list 0.5 W for both modes. In reality there might be a very small difference to keep a LED blinking but that would be something in the order of 0.01 W. To put it in perspective 0.5 W x 365 days x 24 hours = 4380 watt hours  or 4.4 kWh so in either mode you're looking at under $1 a year and it won't affect the lifespan either way because the modes are so similar.\nAs for turning on the monitor first I'm not sure but would guess that's just to give time for the monitor to start up so that the attached computer can detect it's present. It could just be leftover in the instructions from an older PC and/or operating system combination that required it.\n\nA: \nWill this save energy, money and the life span of the monitor - or the\n  opposite?\n\nUsing no current as compared to very little current will save energy and money.  How much, will need to be measured by you using something like a Kill-A-Watt power meter.\nAs for the lifespan, what you save will be negligible and most likely moot.  LCDs now have a MBTF of 100,000 hours or more.  This equates to 11.5 years of continual use.  Chances are you will get a different monitor because your needs would have changed (several times) by the time it fails.\nAs for your edit/question, what that is telling you is that sleep and power off is the same except that in power off, it doesn't respond to the \"wake\" signal sent from the computer when in powered off state.\n", "Q: How to get an LG Ultra HD (27UD88) and Macbook Pro 13\" 2017 running at 60hz? I recently bought a MacBook Pro 13-inch 2017 and an LG Ultra HD (27UD88) 27\" display.\nBefore buying the display I researched a bit and found no issues in relation to the MacBook Pro.\nHowever, after attaching the screen via the USB-C cable that came along with the display, I only have the option of a 30hz refresh rate.\nI've Googled this without finding much - it seems like no one else is having this problem. From a result, I've also learned that my \"Display\" page in \"System Preferences\" looks slightly different than a screenshot from an article.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UD88-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor (LG official page, shows 60hz)\n\n*https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/04/how-to-enable-4k-60hz-resolution-2016-macbook/ (speaks of a patch needed for MacBook 2016)\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5azoij/2016_macbook_pros_and_lg_27ud88/ (at least one use confirms 60hz with MacBook Pro)\n\n\nA: I got it working. I'm not sure exactly how, but here's what I tried, in the order of what I believe fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable DisplayPort 1.2 in screen configuration\n\n*Reverse the USB-C cable\n\n*Set \"Ratio\" to \"1:1\" in screen configuration (I've since tested this and switching it back had no negative effect)\n\n\n(3) was recommended by a user in a forum thread.\nUpdate 2018-01-29\nI've since experienced the problem once more, without changing any settings. Attaching/detaching the cable fixed it.\nUpdate 2018-05-06\nAfter the most recent MacOS update (10.13.4) it no longer downgrades to 30hz, instead, it never comes on. If the cable is dettached, the computer crashes and has to be booted. So far, the only solution I know of is restarting the computer, which works 50 % of the time, and if not, reattach the cable (it usually won't crash after a restart).\nThis happens after screen sleep and detaching/attaching.\nUpdate 2018-12-13\nIn this third evolution of the problem (MacOS 10.14.1) the computer no longer crashes. Roughly 9/10 times it will display in 30hz/horrible resolution and all I have to do (sigh) is detach/attach the cable until I hit that 1/10 where it works. It's a daily 5 minutes routine for me.\nThis setup (MacBook Pro 13\" 2017 w/o touch + 27UD88-W) is not recommendable to anyone.\n\nA: I had same problem with any HDMI cable. My solution was: MacBookPro 2017 thunderbolt out > thunderbolt in on a hub > Display Port cable out from hub > Display Port cable into back of LG monitor. Looks beautiful. And when I bring up Apple's display system prefs, the LG shows the same window with 5 scaling options that appears on laptop itself.

PLEASE HELP!!!\n\nA: First, please edit your post to reflect the question (Setting up HP 4520, or some such) rather than the version of macOS you have.\nHP has downloadable drivers for your printer here. With HP printers just Google the make and model of the printer along with \"driver\" or \"download\" to find what you need.\nThere is a problem though as the earliest macOS version supported is 10.8.

Can application B which is opened at the moment catch the information I've copied?\nDoes OS X protect from such vulnerabilities? \nUpdate:\nTo be more specific what if I copy a password from a password manager, is the pass accessible for all the apps while it is in clipboard? If so how password managers protect a user in this case?\n\nA: This is not a vulnerability per se.\nThe clipboard is accessible system wide which is why you can copy something from application A and paste it to application B.\nIt's not meant nor does it function as a secure holing area.\nIf an application has sensitive data fields, it is up to the developers to block clipboard access to the data.   For all intents and purposes, once info is in the clipboard, it's accessible.\nAs a test and demo, copy your password from your password manager.  Open terminal and type the command pbpaste.  It will output the password that's residing in your clipboard.\n\nA: It's probably worth stating that having any app on your system which you do not trust is not advisable. \nAs others have already mentioned (and this post is old, so this benefits only those who stumble upon it later), there are ways in some password managers (I'm familiar with 1Password, personally) that can remove that item from your clipboard after a predetermined period of time. However, beyond that concern, I would seriously question the idea of running an app for which you do not have a certain level of trust.

I've had no shortage of dramas losing work and losing track of files since the feature was introduced, so maybe \"I'm Doing It Wrong\"TM.\nThe latest drama comes about when using file syncing applications. In my case, Box. I have a regular workflow that looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a file stored in my Box Sync folder on one computer, do some work, save it.\n\n*Open the newly synced file on a different computer, do some work, save it.\n\n*Return to the original computer, where the file is still open...\n\n\nAt this point I'm faced with a challenge. The open file doesn't have the changes from the other computer, which is normal - I haven't re-opened it from disk. However, there is no longer any way to close the file without saving the current contents! I can either close and revert (which replaces the file on disk with the last saved version on that computer) or I can close and save (which replaces the file on disk with the current version on that computer). Either way, I lose the changes I made on the other computer.\nThe best workaround I've come up with is to force quit the application (which is risky), or to duplicate the open file in Finder, close the open file (choosing revert or save - it doesn't matter), delete the just-closed file and open the duplicated file instead.\nPretty convoluted right?\nIt gets worse when I'm sharing my Box folder with a second person - in that case I need to be mighty sure to close the file after every editing session, or risk overwriting the other person's changes.\nIs there any way to rescue some sanity before macos descends completely into iOS-banality?\n\nA: Good news. After some prompting over in the Apple support forums and experimentation, I've discovered that the \"close and revert\" option does not do what it says. In fact it closes the document without touching the file on disk - exactly what I'm after!\nTo recap, when closing a modified file that supports Versions, this dialog appears:\n\nThere does not appear to be an option to close without changing what's on disk. However, the Revert Changes button actually behaves like a Don't Save button, leaving the file on disk untouched.\nThis is precisely the behaviour I need to support the case where the file on disk has been modified by another application and I want to preserve those changes.\nAs made clear in the Apple thread, this is all probably subject to change and may be fragile, but for now I have a solution.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 13\" Retina Late 2013 trackpad replacement I'm having troubles with replacing the trackpad on my MBPr 13\" Late 2013. I've tried two replacement parts. With the first part only click works, but nothing else (I cannot move the mouse pointer at all), and with the second part nothing works at all. I tried the original cable and replacement cables but the results are the same (old trackpad works with the new cables / new trackpads do not work with the old cable...). So I'm kind of baffled because I could not find anybody having troubles doing this. One of the quirks of my makbook may be that it has a Russian keyboard.\nI've tried resetting SMC and NVRAM to no avail.\nHave anybody had any luck replacing the trackpad? Where did you get the parts? I'm kind of reluctant purchasing yet another one...\nThanks\n\nA: I was having the same issue, trackpad not working was ruining my day. The easiest fix could be to plug in an external trackpad or mouse to your Mac, but it didn't work for me, even I tried resetting but didn't help.\nThen I replaced the trackpad with a refurbished one and it is working perfectly.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a single Time Machine backup so that two Macs are always in sync? I have a Time Machine and two Macs.  I want both computers to be the same, not back them up separately. \nIs it possible to use one as a primary (always backing up from one) and then \"downloading\" the latest changes onto another?\n\nA: Time Machine is not designed to do this. It will not make bootable backups, so you can't use a Mac as a destination for backup (and have this backup be \"functional\").\nThere are other solutions for synchronizing multiple machines. If iCloud/Dropbox/Google Drive type solutions are not sufficient for your needs, there are other tools that can sync - Chronosync is one solution.\n", "Q: Does setting sharing & permissions on \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" disk do anything? I have a Mac Mini being used as a file server with an external hard drive used to store the shared folders.  If the \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" is not checked, I can control access for specific users using the System Preferences -> Sharing pane.\nHowever, if I check the \"Ignore ownership on this volume\", all user accounts on the system (including network user accounts created with \"Sharing only\" option) can read/write to the shared folders over the network.  It appears that any sharing & permissions rules are completely ignored on this volume (which I suppose makes sense).\n\nHowever, why does the system then allow me to add custom access rules to this volume?  Do these rules do anything on a volume with \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" enabled?\n\nA: When you set a volume to ignore ownership the kernel sets the files on that volume to the user unknown. Files owned by the unknown user appear to be owned by any user that can access those files. Still the privileges grant what you can do with any file.\n", "Q: Skype texting on iPhone no longer makes any sounds at all No idea what's going on here, but sometime within the last week or so Skype on my iPhone SE has stopped making any text-related sounds.

I've been trying to create some persistent USB Linux thumb drives loaded with Elementary OS and a few other Linux distros, but have had no such luck.  I don't really like the idea of partitioning my Mac and installing other OS directly on it, as I like to keep my Mac drive purely macOS, but since I'm having no luck with the persistent thumb drives, I'm considering partitioning my Mac drive and installing the distros on their own partitions.  This idea doesn't entirely bother me, but I've been reading of other user who have had issues deleting the partitions after they have been made.  I don't want to be stuck with a Linux partition on my comp if I don't care to keep using it.  Can anyone here verify if they can delete a Mac partition?\nMy setup is a 2015 MacBook Pro 15 inch Retina running macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra).\nThanks.\n\nA: I can make some suggestions regarding creating and removing Linux related partitions on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*The disk tools provide by Apple are 100% unreliable with respect to Linux related partitions. I am not saying that occasionally a tool provided by Apple will not work as documented, but if it does, soon a update will occur causing a change in the behavior of the tool. Two of the most used Apple disk tools are the Disk Utility application and the diskutil command.\n\n*To install Linux, you usually have to shrink your Mac partitions to create free space. For this you can use the disk tools provided by Apple. However, if you need to create new partitions, then make sure the these partitions are of a type frequently encountered by Apple. Microsoft FAT32 partitions are a good choice. So for example, if you need a ext4 and swap partitions for Ubuntu, then use Apple's disk tools to shrink your macOS partitions and create two new FAT32 partitions. Later, when installing Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu partitioning tools to delete the FAT32 partitions and recreate the necessary ext4 and swap partitions.\n\n*Apple disk tools should not be used to remove Linux related partitions. Once the Linux partitions have be removed, Apple's disk tools should be used to reclaim the free space. Many of the tools, you can choose from to the remove Linux related partitions, will need to be run with System Integrity Protection (SIP) disabled or from Recovery mode. Another option would  be to boot from an external drive and then remove the partitions from the internal drive. Some popular command line tools are gpt and gdisk.\n\n*Apple started eliminating the BIOS boot option in Mac models starting with the 2015 model year. Therefore, you probably should only choose Linux versions that can 64 bit EFI boot. This means the boot code, for which ever Linux you choose, will be installed in the EFI partition. So, to boot an installed Linux may require modifying the EFI partition or installing the rEFInd Startup Manager into this EFI partition.\n\n*If you do not have a lot of experience installing Linux, you may what to first install in a virtual machine. A free virtual machine software called VirtualBox is provide by Oracle. I often try different installation configurationss, using the same Linux iso file, before installing in a actual Mac computer.\n\n", "Q: Installing gnu-tar without brew I am trying to install gnu-tar based on a tutorial guide I am following.

It can be missed easily. \n\nA: When nothing else works, you can try reinitializing the flash drive back to the conditions similar to when it was manufactured.\nFirst, you need to determine the file name for the flash drive. Insert the flash drive in a USB port and execute the following Terminal application command. \ndiskutil list\n\nThe file name will be /dev/disk followed by a positive integer. You should also see the phrase (external, physical). For example, my 16 GB flash drive produces the output shown below. So the file name is /dev/disk2.\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.5 GB    disk2\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WINSTALL                15.5 GB    disk2s1\n\nNext, the command to reinitialize the flash drive is given below. If your file name was not /dev/disk2, make the appropriate substitution.\ndiskutil  partitionDisk  /dev/disk2  1  MBR  FAT32  MYUSB  R\n\n\nA: I had a SanDisk USB stick that was giving me this issue when trying to build a bootable disk in Disk Drill.

Hopefully this will fix the issue for you as well.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a Sandisk 32GB SD card. I solved it with the Windows management disk. I erased all partitions of the disk and then created a fat32. Initially no drive letter was assigned but then from My Computer, format the drive without problems.\nMy SD card had this problem after using it for a raspberry pi.\n\nA: I had this with a Sandisk card because I wasn't using the microSD to SD converter it came with, but one I had from a Raspberry Pi. As soon as I used the official one it worked fine.\n\nA: I just faced the same issue on OSX Mojave with a Western Digital 2TB USB external drive. It started happening after I was trying to create multiple partitions using Disk Utility.. it kept hanging and becoming unresponsive. Even after rebooting the problem would continue. I then tried using the command line and ran into the error above.\nWhat worked for me is I booted into Windows 10 and from there I was easily able to delete all the partitions on my drive and format it as ex-fat. Then I booted back into OSX and I was able to format that partition was JHFS+. I then continued to run into problems trying to create multiple partitions. I had to repeat the above cycle and finally I was able to create all my partitions by creating them one at a time.\n", "Q: How to start Safari on a browser page only when Error 502 stops happening? I've got a situation where if I push an update to an instance on the web, it will take 3-5 minutes to compile, then when that compiling has successfully finished, the instance will shoot Error 502 for a couple of minutes before it will start running again.\nI'm looking for a solution where, the instance (a server URL) will be queried every 5 seconds or so, and when it stops replying 502, Safari will boot up.\nAny idea how I could do that? So far, on the terminal, I can run this:\ncurl -I http://url 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | cut -d$' ' -f2\n\nand this will output the HTTP Port response or whatever, but I'm not savvy enough to \"do that every 5 seconds\" or to define a \"If (resulting response) is X, keep repeating loop, but If (resulting response) is Y, then launch Safari with an URL\".\nAny ideas?\n\nA: A \"quick and dirty\" script to accomplish what you are looking to do could be written as:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nurl = \"http://url\"\ncode=`curl -I $url 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | cut -d$' ' -f2`\n\nwhile [ \"$code\" == 502 ]\ndo\n  sleep 5\n  echo trying again\n  code=`curl -I $url 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | cut -d$' ' -f2`\ndone\n\nopen -a Safari $url\n\nBasically, what it does is caputure the value that you output in a variable called code.  It then evaluates that variable in a While/Do loop every 5 seconds until the value changes.  Once that happens, it exists the loop and launches a Safari instance pointing to the URL.\n", "Q: Icon in applications folder is a folder full of files I noticed that one of the applications in the Launchpad (/Applications folder) is a folder with a bunch of files in it.\nHave two questions:\n1) How does OS X actually launch the program\n2) Which of the files in that folder is actually the application\nWhen opening the folder in Terminal it comes up as Chromium.app\n\nA: What you are referring to is called an Application Bundle.  Within the application bundle is a hierarchy of files as follows:\nChromium App\n  Contents\n    MacOS\n       Chromium\n\nmacOS launches the file by calling the file located in Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium.  It knows to execute this file becuase....well...after all, it's Apple's framework.  macOS knows that the executable will be located here.\nIf you wanted to lauch the file manually (like in Terminal), you could just issue the command\n/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium\n\n", "Q: Safari won't open from one network client I have a user who is having difficulty opening Safari on one particular client machine. They have tested it on all other client machines in the same office and it works without issue, but this one machine will not have it.

Has anybody come across anything similar to this before or know where to look to try and find the issue?\n\nA: Alas I never did figure out the cause of this. Due to the nature of where the machine was, I could only work on it for a few minutes at a time in a \"test - didn't work - go away and try the fix from a SSH terminal in another room\" sort of way. \nFor the poor unfortunate soul who finds this in the future, the only thing that seemed to fix it was installing a security patch that was waiting to be installed. Issue just completely went away after that and I'm still non the wiser as to the cause.\n", "Q: macOS Calendar adding its own alerts I recently got a MacBook, and I've added a few Google accounts to the Calendar app. Ever since I did, I've been getting alerts about the event after it's already passed or in progress. It seems as though Calendar.app is adding alerts to the event on its own; this didn't happen before I added my Google account to the macOS calendar.\n\nThe only alert that is supposed to be there is ‘Alert ten minutes before start’. Every other alert there has added somehow.\n\nA: I've seen this behavior quite a bit with the calendar application when I dismiss the reminders. More specifically, if you snooze, \"remind me tomorrow\" or otherwise \"kick it down the road\", it seems to pick up these additional reminders. This is with a combination of iOS and macOS devices on the same shared calendar.\nI think this comes about because you have a reminder several hours or days ahead of the actual event.\nSuggestion? If you have something that you want to remind you on a daily basis, instead of kicking the reminder, just set it to a daily repeating reminder instead. That way you can get the benefit of being nagged about it but also you can just dismiss / mark completed today and hear about it again tomorrow without building up the multiple reminders.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make a screen recording of an entire page in a browser window?

How can I take a screenshot of the entirety of a web browser (or just the HTML page) which includes the select input?\nI can get the following images with Apple shift 4 and clicking space:\n\n\nbut I want something more like the following, where I had to manually choose the boundaries\n\n\nA: As a UX Designer I very routinely need to capture menu dropdowns as well as the selected item within the drop down menu. Most of the time (though not always) I am able to do this via CMD-SHIFT-4 by first clicking the field, keeping the mouse pressed in one hand while pressing CMD-SHIFT-4 with the other hand. Most of the time the dropdown and even selected menu item will \"freeze\" and remain stationary on the screen while you draw your marquee around the screen area you want to capture. Then you release and have your custom shaped image. (I just did this on Youtube.com, Chrome Browser 64.0, High Sierra 10.13.3 )\n\nThough quite often on a multitude of sites you can do this all via CMD-SHIFT-4 and thus no-need to later crop, the dropdown and selected item does not always \"freeze\" while you marquee around it. And there are also many times when I want to show an on-screen notification or confirmation effect in addition to the menu choices and selected item. In both cases I absolutely must resort to CMD-SHIFT-3 and, yes, crop afterwards.\nI believe Leonard Challis's answer is sound and I know of no other way to achieve this than to use the full-screen screenshot command as he described. So what that it then requires having to crop the full-screen image captured to isolate the area you want to show. Maybe someone has found 3rd party software that let's you achieve your goal on the fly. Perhaps there is a Chrome or other browser extension that will freeze the screen to display the menu-dropdown selection state. Or maybe recorded Screen-capture is the better tool, particularly if you want to document a whole sequence of interface/selection instructions. And you can select key frames to crop into images. Doesn't appear anyone has provided any such suggested software.\nI specifically and categorically disagree with grgarside's answer claiming that the CMD-SHIFT-3 solution is \"even worse than OP's already described ⇧⌘4 for selecting a region, since you then have to open the image in Preview for cropping for no added benefit over taking a screenshot of a region.\" That's completely incorrect as the OP specifically wanted to be able to display the drop down menu. That's the added benefit.\nONE ADDENDUM:  The CMD-SHIFT-4 \"all in one\" action also works the majority of the time on most sites when right-clicking a link and wanting to capture the pop up menu and your selection. 2 EXAMPLES right here on this thread:\n\n\nA: My suggestion would be to just use the regular Cmd+Shift+3 to take a full screen shot, then crop the image in Preview to the area that you want.\n", "Q: Does the HomePod offer 3rd-party apps?

My Questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is the Lubuntu install not working? How can I make it work?\n\n*Why are my Windows partitions not showing up in any partition managers?\n\n\nConfused? Read below.\nWhat I Did\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an old MacBook air lying around that I had installed Arch Linux on.\n\n*I kinda got tired of Arch Linux, and wanted to see the effects, so I did the classic rm -rf / --no-preserve-root.\n\n*Yesterday, I wanted to install Lubuntu. I flashed it to a  usb flash drive with Etcher.\n\n*I launched the installer and ran it, choosing to erase disk and install Lubuntu.\n\n*It was a success, until the end where I got the error grub-efi-amd64-signed failed installation /target/. Looking at the logs, I also got the errors ubiquity: E: Unable to locate package shim-signed and grub-installer: info: calling 'apt-install grub-efi-amd64-signed' failed and the installer crashed.\n\n*Thinking it might be a lack of internet connectivity, I connected to ethernet. I know it worked because the option to download updates wasn't greyed out. It still didn't work.\n\n*I read somewhere that I might need a EFI system partition, so I manually partitioned it. It still didn't work.\n\n*Getting tired of that, I wanted to have some operating system, so I created a bootable Windows 10 installation media with Rufus. It installed perfectly, and Windows worked fine after I installed the BootCamp support drivers, besides no bluetooth or multitouch trackpad support.\n\n*Again, I wanted to install Lubuntu, maybe install it to another hard drive (an HGST Touro S). So I opened up the Lubuntu installer again and manually partitioned my hard drive (the external one). Of course, it failed...\n\n*BUT I noticed a weird thing. The partition manager in the Lubuntu installer said that my MacBook's hard drive was empty. 100% free space. The same thing appeared on GParted in the Lubuntu live OS.\n\n*But that's weird because my computer boots, and on the Windows Disk Management app it says that there are partitions.\n\n\nNote\nI am re-posting a question from superuser that is now deleted. This was recommended here.\n\nA: I see clear indications you are not thinking through what you are doing. Rather, you are throwing stuff at a wall hoping something sticks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Normally, I would expect either macOS or OS X is installed. From the operating system, you can determine the model identifier and current firmware version. If necessary, the firmware can be updated by a download or by upgrading the operating system.\n\n*The model identifier allows us to determine if the EFI is 32 bit or 64 bit. Whether or not your Mac has a BIOS. If the processors are 32 bit or 64 bit. How to properly download the Windows Support Software. Which versions of Windows will run on your Mac. The type of booting (EFI vs BIOS) available for Linux installations.\n\n*You failed to include if you are partitioning using a MBR or GPT scheme. Maybe you are using a Hybrid scheme? Who knows? \n\n*You failed to include which version of Lubuntu you tried to install. From a quick check of Lubuntu's download page, I see there are many versions to choose from. From the information you have posted, I would have no idea which one to choose.\n\n\nTake your installation of Windows. How did you determine which Boot Camp Support Software to install? Obvious you picked the wrong one, since some of the hardware failed to work. I could not possible tell you how to acquire the Boot Camp Support Software based on the information you posted. I have no idea which version of Windows you choose or if the version was 32 bit or 64 bit.\nWhere to go from here? Get some version of OS X or macOS installed. Maybe this is the question you should have asked in the first place. For now, an answer to this question will have to wait.\n", "Q: How to change iCloud email I want to delete my existing iCloud email address and replace it with a new one.

I am not familiar with the iPad but my MacBook died and I can't afford a new one. How can I install software that is not from the Apple Store on my iPad? I have the software .ipa file, but how do I install it?\n\nA: You can’t install software that’s not from the App Store except by compiling it yourself from source code (but you need a Mac to do that). And iPads can’t just run Mac software even if Apple would let you install it. They have different CPUs and a different operating system, and can only run software designed to run on iOS. There’s no iOS version of FileMaker (though there’s a client app available). \n\nA: Get yourself an Apple ID, if you dont already have one, and get FileMaker Go from the app store. It’s free and allows you to run all your FileMaker databases on your iPad. Use iTunes to transfer the databases or send them to an email account on your iPad.\nYou won’t be able to make any changes to the schema or layout, but you can work with the data. For that you would need FileMaker Pro on a Mac or Windows machine.\n", "Q: Restricting a user to a specific source network IP address Assume my Mac Mini (Sierra/High Sierra, doesn't matter) has two defined users: user1 and user2.\nThe machine has two IPs assigned via Ethernet:\nen7: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500  \noptions=4<VLAN_MTU>     \n...\ninet 192.168.1.24 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255    \ninet 192.168.1.25 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255\n...\nstatus: active\n\nIs it possible restricting user1 to 192.168.1.24 and user2 to 192.168.1.25?\ni.e, when user1 performs any network actions on the machine, the source IP would be 192.168.1.24.\nBoth users can be logged in to the machine at the same time via SSH.\nUPDATE\nSo it's possible to perform source IP NAT translation by adding the following rule to pfctl\nnat on en0 inet from any to any -> 192.168.1.24\n\nBut nat-rules do not support filtering (by specific user) - in contrary to block/pass rules, so I need to keep digging\n\nA: The solution was to implement a Network Kernel Extension that changes the source IP of the socket based on the user ID. \nMore on NKEs can be found here \n", "Q: How to ensure separate pathways of each instance of Python I recently upgraded to High Sierra on my Macbook Air.\nI installed the latest upgrade of Python: 2.7.14 from python.org. There is documentation and a Read Me file for 2.7.14 in the Applications folder.  The Read Me file for the user-installed python states:\n\nAs of Python 2.7.0, user-installed Python 2.7 versions from python.org installers added the system-wide site-packages directory for the Apple-supplied Python 2.7 to the end of their search path. This meant that packages installed with the system Python 2.7 could also be used by the user-installed Python 2.7. While sometimes convenient, this also often caused confusion with the implicit coupling between the two Python instances. Separately, as of macOS 10.12, Apple changed the layout of the system site-packages directory, /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages, in a way that can now cause installation of pip components to fail. To avoid the confusion and the installation failures, as of 2.7.13 user-installed pythons no longer add /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages to sys.path. If you are using a package with both a user-installed Python 2.7 and the system Python 2.7, you will now need to ensure that separate copies of the package are installed for each instance.\n\nI am not fully comprehending the meaning of this. I want to be sure that I have everything set up properly before proceeding. Is there a command I can type into my terminal that will point to the pathway of the Python 2.7.14 I just installed?  I want to be sure there are separate pathways for each instance of Python. \n\nA: You should set up virtual environments so each python version will be independent of others. Setting these up is fairly easy and you can find instructions on the internet here and  here as well as many other places.  I run virtual environments and this allows me to run 2.7.13 or 3.6 without any problems. I just activate wich environment I want and then start running that version of python.\n", "Q: Mechanism of Screenshot Basically I with my team are figuring out a way to block screenshots taken on our corporation's computers (Mac mostly). I have searched it extensively and found that there is something called Screen buffer which is being accessed by any screenshot taking software (eg. Snipping Tool etc). I tried to find the exact mechanism and the actual implementation of such softwares but with no luck. Also I found out that Netflix uses some kind of technology which corrupts screenshot image and blackens it. I did not find any actual mechanism or implementation to study it further. I also came across something called Hardware overlays but did not understand it properly in order to use it for actual implementation. I have considered a way to edit scancode maps in registry but I am looking for a more general way. I read a few articles for apple's FPS though. Can somebody please guide me through this? Some good resources for the same would be highly appreciated. Any particular or relevant forums or subs to discuss this are also welcome\n\nA: Sounds like you've been barking up the wrong tree for a little while. A screen buffer is a generic programming concept which does not describe the situation in macos well. Hardware overlay will likely only affect what appears on the monitor, not what appears in a screenshot. And Netflix's method is no more interesting that DVD Player's method.\nFortunately, this question has been asked and answered on the sister Stack Overflow site. Basically there is a private API that allows this, but being private you're best to talk directly to Apple about it via a DTS request.\n", "Q: Why Time Machine can't make first copy if lid is closed? The Situation: MacBook (Pro or Air, no difference) can't makes first copy to Time Capsule disk if:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power Nap is switched on.\n\n*Power cord is plugged on.\n\n*Disk on Mac is SSD.\n\n*I start copy via Time Machine, it starts normally.\n\n*I close the lid, wait 10 minutes, open the lid and see that copy process fails.\n\n\nIf lid is open, copy process run normally.\nThe situation is true for number of laptops, 2015, 2016, Pro or Air. Always all software are updated.\nApple tech support (via phone and chat) told that it is recommended to not close the lid. If I ask \"why, what prevents Power Nap to make the copy\" no certain answers. Only, \"we advise you\". There are no certain article about this process.\nQuestion: Why should the first copy be done with lid opened (not put to sleep)? \n\nA: When you perform an initial Time Machine backup, it is making a backup of everything which may (read that as more than likely) take a long time.  Subsequent backups are only files that have changed and these are, most often, very small changes.\n\nYour first backup\nThe first time you back up your Mac with Time Machine, it might take a\nlong time to complete. This is because Time Machine copies most or\nall of the data on your Mac to your first backup. You can keep using\nyour Mac while Time Machine works in the background to back up your\ndata.\nAfter the first backup is complete, Time Machine works in the\nbackground to back up only files that have changed since your last\nbackup. This means your next backup is usually faster.\n\nWhen your Mac is sleeping with Power Nap enabled, Time Machine backups are attempted at 1 hour intervals.\n\nTime Machine backups are attempted hourly until a successful backup\nhas been completed.\n\nThis interval based backup is designed to backup the minor changes.  The first backup is much, much larger and requires more resources. This also tells you why after 10 minutes it \"failed\" - it's an hourly process.  Remember, you're putting it to sleep, meaning it's not going to run at full speed until it finishes something; it's going to going to attempt things at regular intervals until it either done or it wakes up.\nIf Apple is advising you that you don't put your Mac to sleep during your first backup, you should heed their advice.\n", "Q: How to get list of folders in sidebar? How to get the list of folders in the sidebar using AppleScript?\nIt is okay to get the list of all items too since I will be able to search for them \n\nA: You can't.  Finder's Sidebar is a location for shortcuts to be easily accessible by the user.\nFrom Apple's Human Interface Design Guidelines:  \n\nthe sidebar in a Finder window includes a list of frequently accessed locations and tag-based search shortcuts. The user can select one to access its contents or results in the main portion of the window.\n\nAdditionally, having a folder list is not practical in this element. Anything more than 2 levels of hierarchy (which is highly plausible in a folder listing) is discouraged.  In this instance, Apple states that a column view be used.\n\nIn general, refrain from exposing more than two levels of hierarchy within a sidebar. In some cases, a second sidebar may be warranted\n  when a data hierarchy is deeper than two levels. If your app requires\n  the navigation of deeply nested objects, consider implementing a\n  column view.\n\nBottom line; Apple discourages 3rd party developers from doing this, meaning Apple's Finder is definitely not going to show files like this.  \nYou can put a shortcut to a folder, but you won't get a list of folders.\n", "Q: Desktop and Documents folder invisible in finder, but visible with ls command As the title said, my Desktop and Documents folder doesn't appear in finder when i'm in the path /users/[username]\nBut however : \n$ ls /users/[username]\nApplications    Qt              workspace\nDesktop         Movies          \nDocuments       Music\nDownloads       Pictures\nLibrary         Public\n\nHow is that possible ?\n\nA: This is normal behavior if you have activated Desktop & Documents Folders syncing in iCloud (as @pjc90 has mentioned in the comments).\n\n", "Q: How to create this static route on macos?

I bought a 2.4GHz mid 2010 MacBook Pro logicboard on eBay. Upon installing RAM, the computer beeps every five seconds indicating it doesn't detect RAM. I used standard 8500s 1066MHZ RAM with 8 modules on each side of the chip (2Rx4?). The seller claims the board will only work with RAM that has 4 modules on each side of the chip (1Rx4?).

A reboot will usually fix the issue, but this is not fix but a major inconvenience and stretches the definition of \"work around\"\nMost DisplayPort to HDMI adapters are passive (they're inexpensive), but what you need is an active adapter which will recreate the the HDMI signal and not just reorder the signals.\nIdeally, you wan to \"go native\" with DisplayPort to DisplayPort for the best singal and performance possible, but when that is not possible, using an active adapter is your next best bet.\n\nBackground\nHDMI is a flaky signal to begin with from clock signal being a dedicated wire versus being embedded (DisplayPort) to audio issues:\n\n*\n\n*Apple TV Audio Randomly Dropping Out...\n\n*Plex and HDMI audio problems\n\nI personally experienced the HDMI audio issue dropping out not just on Roku, but on Apple TV and even same brand (Sony) TVs connected to Blue-Ray players.  It's what prompted me to research into this to solve the issue.\nWhat I found was that you could easily fix the problem by switching inputs (i.e. Roku/Apple TV drops audio, switch to cable TV input for 2 seconds, then switch back).  As for connecting TVs to HDMI display inputs, I found that the computer (Apple and PC) would require either putting to sleep or rebooting due to no display - the screen would be recognized, but there would be no image.\nI found (on the Apple/PC side) that standardizing on DisplayPort solved these issues.  One of the reasons for this is that the clock signal is embedded within the signal as opposed to being on two separate wires.  When converting, the issue (IMO) was that going from DP (no dedicated signal wires) to HDMI (expecting dedicated signal wires) was the fault.\nHDMI is the only option\nHDMI is a consumer grade connectivity and thus, they’re everywhere.  As in this case, the Asus monitor has only HDMI ports.  In this case the key is to use an active adapter that recreates the actual HDMI signal.  I write more about this in the post:  Passive vs. Active\n\nA: If I were you I would start simple and try a different cable, faulty or cheap cables can cause unexpected behaviour with monitors.\n\nA: If resetting the SMC and NVRAM doesnt help then you'll need to reinstall MacOS since the issue maybe software based. I'd also do a first aid on your hard drive to make sure that its still healthy.\n", "Q: Account password in keychain Is it safe to store password from macOS account inside of any keychain?\nI think that if someone can access my keychain, then this someone can access anything on my macOS.

There are also other examples, but those are most common and irritating.\nThe system-wide auto-correction is disabled (in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Text):\n\nThe Autocorrection setting in Outlook is also disabled:\n\nI use Grammarly in Chrome, but it should not affect any system applications.\nI noticed that this become more notorious once I added German and Russian to my keyboard layouts. It also had happened before, but it wasn't that irritating. Can it be somehow related? That would partially make sense, as oft is a common German word, but the auto-correction happens while I am using the US keyboard layout, not German (that I rarely use).\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but I think I may just have figured it out.\nI am using Outlook on PC, but I have had the exact same issue, such as \"for the\" becoming \"fort he\".\nI have German and English languages installed and I believe this is the source of the problem (and it goes back at least 14 years if you try Google. Good bug fixing MS).\nAnyway, the solution I found was to turn off \"Detect Language Automatically\" in the email editor. In the PC version this can be found on the Review ribbon under Language. I hope the Mac version has a similar layout.\n\nThis has appeared to work so far. It's a pain because changing languages in email will require a manual flip each time, but if I can avoid oft he, fort he, fort hat, etc. then it is worth it.\nHope this helps, even so late after the fact!\n\nA: I encountered the same problem. I have Dutch as preferred language in Outlook, English as second preference, and each time I start an email with 'thanks for the quick reply' (which, incidentally, turns out to be quite often), it gets changed into 'thanks fort he quick reply', before detecting that I've switched to English. Extremely annoying. \nWhile turning off the automatic language detection works, I found a more convenient solution that works perfectly for me: Simply add an item to the autocorrect to 'change' the string 'for the' into 'for the'.\n\nHope this still bears relevance for some. \n", "Q: Does mac OS install process erase flashdrive data DURING the install? It's well-documented that creating an install drive erases the target medium, but what about later, during the install process ?  \ni.e. can I create a bootable flash installer, and then add files to it, knowing that a later use of the flash for an installation will not erase those files ?\n\nA: In my experience you can indeed put files on a flash drive that you made to boot and install macOS. The install process only reads from the flash drive. So your utilities should be safe.\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut ctrl+option+shift+power for? I'm running a MacBook Pro Retina (Mid 2014) with macOS High Sierra (10.13.3).\nCoincidentally, I found the key combination Control ⌃+Option ⌥+Shift ⇧+Power button that immediately turns the MacBook off. As soon as I press the buttons, the screen is black and the computer is off. It's like a kill switch.\nWhat is that shortcut for and how is it called? Does it hurt my computer?\nEDIT: Maybe it is related to the SMC Reset? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n\nA: According to the apple support: This key combination resets the SMC (System Management Controller). The SMC takes control of the battery. Once the controller has been reset, the power supply is cut off.\nIt is not recommended to do this while the Mac is turned on.\n", "Q: Back to My Mac Only Works One Way I've got an interesting problem happening.\nFrom iMac ➔ MacBookPro Back To My Mac works fine.\nFrom MacBookPro ➔ iMac… not so much.  Sometimes I can't even get past the connection piece. It just does that shaky thing that it likes to do when it doesn't accept a password.\nWhen/if I do I get an error message that says the viewer and server are incompatible.\n\nSame network (just to rule out firewall craziness), all items are checked in iCloud etc. I can SSH back and forth. It's only when I try to use file or screen sharing that I see the issue.\nAny ideas where I should start? I’m flying blind on this one - no idea why it would work one way and not the other.\n\nA: I may be jumping the gun here with my answer, but I'm going to assume that one of your Macs is running macOS Mojave and the other is running an earlier version of macOS.\nmacOS Mojave dropped support for the Back to My Mac feature. Instead, users are encouraged to use iCloud Drive, screen sharing, and Apple Remote Desktop for the various features you may have been using Back to My Mac for.\nFor more info on this change, refer to Prepare for changes to Back to My Mac on Apple's website.\n", "Q: 64-bit only future and virtual machines Apple has started the phasing out of 32-bit applications on MacOS. How is this going to impact virtual machines, be it Parallels, VMWare, VirtualBox, or Apple own hypervisor? Will it still be possible to run 32-bit OS inside virtual machines?\n\nA: There’s never been a hard limit running older os in VM so this seems like a safe bet to say, yes - virtualization is a good bet to keep 32 bit os alive like it is for os back to System 1 and the (mostly) 32 bit Motorola 68000 processor. \n\nA: It would be hard to prevent things like QEMU from being able to run 32-bit operating systems, as QEMU supports full hardware virtualization (this is distinct from hardware-assisted virtualization).\n32-bit applications will likely become more difficult to run, as one will likely need an appropriately old OS and also any libraries or frameworks that 32-bit application depends on. However a generic 32-bit OS (assuming virtualization support exists for it) should be runnable by anything that does full hardware virtualization.\n", "Q: APFS/High Sierra - `tmutil deletelocalsnapshots` not deleting snapshots Listing local snapshots yields this\n> tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-194719\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-211627\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-224917\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-234619\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-014151\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-024107\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-034442\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-044108\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-054441\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-064120\n\nand i try to delete a local snapshot but running this\n> sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2018-01-30-194719\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-30-194719'\n\nbut listing the local snapshots again showed that the snapshot has not been removed\n> tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-194719\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-211627\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-224917\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-30-234619\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-014151\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-024107\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-034442\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-044108\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-054441\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-01-31-064120\n\n\nJust for fun i wrote a little bash script to delete them all (which also avoids any typos).\nfor date in $(tmutil listlocalsnapshots / | perl -pe 's/com.*(2018.*)/\\1/'); do echo \"deleting $date\"; sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots \"$date\";  done\n\nStrangely enough, i can repetitively run that command above and it will always show the same output:\ndeleting 2018-01-30-194719\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-30-194719'\ndeleting 2018-01-30-211627\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-30-211627'\ndeleting 2018-01-30-224917\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-30-224917'\ndeleting 2018-01-30-234619\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-30-234619'\ndeleting 2018-01-31-014151\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-31-014151'\ndeleting 2018-01-31-024107\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-31-024107'\ndeleting 2018-01-31-034442\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-31-034442'\ndeleting 2018-01-31-044108\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-31-044108'\ndeleting 2018-01-31-054441\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-31-054441'\ndeleting 2018-01-31-064120\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-01-31-064120'\n\n\nWhy are my snapshots not deleting? I am quite low on storage space (13gb of space - the snapshots would not even clear when i had 2gb of free space left)\n\nA: Great solution detecting that the filesystem was corrupt when the normal commands were note working.

I chose the echo math to make it easy to dial up and down without the long string of zeroes getting changed. Feel free to simplify the above command with a number you like that’s larger than your drive if you intend the system clean all possible snapshots.\nHow to thin your local Time Machine Snapshots on macOS High Sierra\n\nA: I think the least-recent time machine snapshots was corrupted - potentially from some system crashes caused by APFS bugs.\nI tried running DIsk Utility's first aid, but that froze my computer for over 3 hours (maybe it ran out of space to work with?) - I ended up having to force-restart.\nI solved the problem by running first aid booted from an external hard drive install of High Sierra.

You can work around this by changing:\nif selectedText contains \"/*\" then\n\nTo:\nif first paragraph of selectedText contains \"/*\" then\n\nHowever Xcode will then show the nested commented code as having errors. So the real value of this script is to use it only on code that will not then be selected again as a larger block after the original commenting by this script.\nWhen uncommenting code you should always be sure to select so the first and last lines of selection contain the block comment characters, /* and */, with no leading or trailing blank lines in the selection.\nAlso, Xcode has a built-in keyboard shortcut to comment selected lines with a leading // by selecting the code and pressing command/. Pressing the same keyboard shortcut removes the leading //. This is some ways negates the need to use this scripted solution.\nThere are third-party plugins for comments in Xcode and a Google search should be fruitful.\nOne example is: BlockComment for Xcode\n\nSee edit history for original answer before the OP was updated with actual details of the objective.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted. \n", "Q: Changing an Apple ID from one @icloud.com address to another I have an Apple ID which ends with @icloud.com and I want to change it to another @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com. I've found a page which describes how to do that but it seems it doesn't work for me. I turned off two-factor authentication and removed all my devices. But there is no the following option:\n\nUnder your Apple ID, click Change Apple ID.\n\nCould you help me?\n\nA: From the Apple Support page about changing your Apple ID (emphasis added by me):\n\nIf your Apple ID email address ends with @icloud.com, @me.com, or\n  @mac.com, you can only change your email address to another\n  @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com email that's already associated with\n  your account.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202667\nIf you created your Apple ID recently with an @icloud.com address as identifier, you most probably can't change that. I think the support document I linked to is targeted at users who have old @me.com or @mac.com addresses that Apple used to issue a long while ago. Or maybe there could be special situations where you actually have two @icloud.com addresses associated with one Apple ID as the result of merging two IDs with the help of Apple Support, but those would be rare exceptional cases. For a recently created @icloud.com style Apple ID, typically you can't change it.\n\nA: As of Aug, 2019, the situation is still unresolved.\nAfter a conversation with Apple Support it transpired that the ability to change an AppleID that ends with @icloud.com to a mail alias that end in @icloud.com is not implemented. \nHowever, it is possible to do this if your mail alias end in @me.com or @mac.com, which is what the support article mentioned in the accepted answer refers to.\nApparently, the reason this hasn't been implemented is because this feature hasn't been requested often enough by the users.\nIf you're affected by this, or if you would like to see this implemented, please visit https://www.apple.com/feedback/icloud.html (Feedback Type: Account) and submit the feedback form to let Apple know that you too would like this feature implemented.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra Calendar notifications appear but have the wrong event time I have a (recurring) meeting notice in my calendar.  On my iPhone and on macOS I get the (half-an-hour before) alert, but they display differently!

I have an iPhone 6 I want to sell. I just reset all the settings and removed all the data using the iPhone 6 option in the general settings. The phone now says \"Hello\" as a new phone would. I don't have a SIM card and cannot logon to the phone to confirm that all is adequately deleted.\nWas the procedure I performed sufficient to adequately remove all of the data, such that another user would not reasonably be able to retrieve the data?\n\nA: All the data on an iOS device is encrypted using strong encryption by default. The keys that are used to encrypted and decrypt our data are stored on the devices. When you choose to \"Erase All Content and Settings\" the device \"obliterates\" the keys. So your data is basically still there but no-one can read it anymore.\nFrom the Apple's iOS Security document:\n\nErase All Content and Settings\nThe “Erase all content and settings” option in Settings obliterates all the keys in Effaceable Storage, rendering all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible. Therefore, it’s an ideal way to be sure all personal information is removed from a device before giving it to somebody else or returning it for service.\nImportant: Don’t use the “Erase all content and settings” option until device has been backed up, as there is no way to recover the erased data.\n\nI'd recommend reading through that document if you are interested in the security features of iOS devices.

This is the same for Safari, except Safari will stop when force quit. I have tried force quitting Finder, restarting, updating, killing the process in the Terminal, clearing the saved state in the Terminal, and force quitting in the Application Monitor. I am on High Sierra, and will get version number soon.\nEdit: Recent hangs seems to be increasing by a rate of 1 a second.\nEdit: Safari works in restore mode (cmd+r)\n\nA: Generally speaking this should happen rarely. That it happens with great regularity points to something wrong with the system. The easiest, first step, would be to use a utility like Onyx. Run the automate tab with no apps running and reboot. It will clean caches, do maintenance scripts and verify files.\nIf that did not fix it I would then look at the possibility that the Finder and Safari preferences files are corrupt. Look for said files in ~/Library/Preferences and /Library/Preferences. Move anything with safari and finder in the name to the desktop and reboot.\nIf you are still having problems I would find and download the latest \"Combo updater\" for your version of macOS. Run it, and reboot when asked. That should repair any problems with the Safari and Finder apps.\nStill not working?

I don't know if this problem is common, or particular to my user account\n\nA: You can nearly get there with a bit of Applescript.\nThis script will read all the \"Children\" of your existing Bookmarks file and re-write them in the order you specify. \"Children\" consist first of History, Bookmarks Bar, Bookmarks Menu and Reading List, so you might want to leave the first 4 items in place.

So do the rename manually for now.\n    --set (value of (property list item \"Children\" of property list file tfile)) to (value of childrenOrdered)\nend tell\n\nI expected the last set line of the script to replace the contents of \"Children\" with the ordered array. Unfortunately this seems to result in an empty (0 byte) file! AppleScript considers the name field read-only, so changing it in place wont work either.\nHowever, manually renaming the items in a property list editor (XCode, text editor, etc.) so that Children is moved aside and orderedChildren is in its place does result in the new ordering appearing in Safari on relaunch.\nPretty clumsy, but if this is heading in the right direction is could be cleaned up and automated.\n", "Q: iPad as Home Hub: Option not available under iPad settings I've given up on trying to make my once working Apple TV Home Hub respond again.

Siri seems to be targeted as the primary method to interact with HomePod other than some rudimentary touch controls that it has. Are there any other ways to interact with it? I'm specifically hoping for some sort of remote control app for iOS. I don't have a particularly good track record with Siri playing the correct song when I ask her to on my iPhone, partly because my music collection contains stuff in many languages; so I prefer to choose the right track manually from a list. I'm aware of the option to AirPlay to it, but I'd prefer the functionality the iTunes Remote iOS app offers: remote-controlling the device through a graphical UI. Any chance for that on HomePod?\n\nA: \nI'm specifically hoping for some sort of remote control app for iOS.\n\nThe standard Music app can be put into a mode where it acts as a HomePod remote control: the user can queue individual tracks and playlists, and the HomePod will play them using its own connection to Apple Music and the iTunes Music Library.\nIt is a little tricky getting the Music app into that mode.\nOne way is to open the Control Center, then long-press or force-touch on the music control. This reveals separate control panels for your iOS device and any other controllable devices, including AppleTV and HomePod. Tapping the HomePod will open the Music app in HomePod-control mode.\n\nA: The HomePod User Manual tells you everything you need to know.\n\nControl HomePod\nYou and anyone in your home can control HomePod using Siri, or by\ntapping the top of HomePod.\n\nTo control the HomePod, you have three options only:\n\n*\n\n*the top of the device\n\n*Siri\n\n*Apple Music (limited to playback control)\n\nYou can use the HomePod as:\n\n*\n\n*speaker phone (make/receive calls through Siri - Siri, call Mom)\n\n*stream music from iTunes via AirPlay\n\n*Listen to Podcasts, News\n\n*Use Siri's personal assistant feature (Siri, set an appointment for dentist)\n\n*Control your home (HomeKit)\n\nThe HomePod App is used to change the settings, not to control it.\n\nHomePod settings\nThe person who set up HomePod can use the Home app on their iOS device\nto change HomePod settings. There are settings you specify for each\nindividual HomePod you have, and settings that apply to all of the\nHomePod devices in your home.\n\n\nA: According to Apple's HomePod site, it can be controlled using Siri and the Home app.\nFor example, here's one of the sections on that page:\n\nJust say “Hey Siri, turn on the lights” or “Hey Siri, make the room cooler.” You can even ask Siri to set scenes, like “Good morning,” that put multiple accessories to work — all at once. A wide range of accessories work with Apple’s HomeKit platform. Just add an accessory to the Home app, then control it with your voice on HomePod.\n\nApple doesn't mention any other type of control other than the buttons on top of the unit, Siri, and the Home app.\n\nA: The latest iTunes update says:\n\niTunes is now designed to work with HomePod.

It’s used for very little other than just making and receiving calls.\nIn general, its reception has always been good and stable, with no unexpected problems.\nLately, however, an issue has started repeating with annoying frequency: when we receive a call and pick up the phone, the conversation goes smoothly for about 20–30 seconds or so, then you hear three short, rapid bleeps (‘doot-doot-doot’), and the connection is dropped. A few seconds later, the signal strength indicator at the top of the screen says “No signal” for about 10–20 seconds. Then full signal comes back and you can continue to make calls as usual.\nI haven’t experienced this issue when calling out—only when receiving calls. When calls are not being made, signal strength also seems to be normal (at least I haven’t noticed it cutting out at other times).\nThe actual signal strength is excellent, so it’s not because of dodgy coverage. We have about ten other phones, both iPhones and Androids, that manage just fine, and this is a recent issue with this one phone as well. Wifi signal/connection is not lost.\nI’ve tried Googling for a solution to this issue, but all I’m able to find are countless reports of either people who can’t receive calls at all on their phones (which we can), or people whose phones just generally have bad reception/signal (which ours doesn’t).\nI’ve tried toggling basically all the reception/signal/connection-related settings I could find, and the phone has been restarted and switched off/on several times, with no effect.\nIs this a known issue that my weak Google-fu is just unable to unearth? And more importantly, is there a solution for it?\n\nA: In order of my preference to get things fixed, you'll likely need help from someone else to tell which.\n\n\n*\n\n*The battery is failing and can't provide the extra power once the call comes in. The radio may be fine at idle listening, but when you call it could need to boost power to get the signal to the tower for transmission from the phone to the tower.\n\n*The phone is on an overloaded cell tower and once the call is connected - the cell tower wants to hand off your active call to a less loaded tower that has different distance / signal strength. (The overload would be non-idle lines - towers can handle many devices that are idle - but need to hand off active transmitters and downloaders when bandwidth caps are reached.)\n\n*There's something about that specific radio where the tower is cutting the calls short.\n\n*All of the above might be summarized as \"call the carrier\" in question for more help\nThe battery might be diagnosed by Apple or you might need the carrier to see the transmit power on your phone when this happens. The cell tower shift would also need the carrier to help. I suppose field test mode might work as well to help diagnose this, but I'd start with the carrier first. The last is 100% the carrier that needs to look over the patterns of disconnect. They surely can trace why 5 calls all drop from one piece of gear if you ask.\n", "Q: Left third of iPad screen is blocked with bookmarks column ⅓ of my screen is blocked on the left by a Bookmarks column.

I installed High Sierra and now my iMac (27\" 2011) can not see the external USB TimeMachine drive.\nThe drive shows up in DiskUtil but it's greyed out. I can not mount it. In fact it doesn't respond to any commands, mount, eject, first aid won't run.\nI also have a MacBook Pro (High Sierra too), it can't read the drive, same problem.\n\nI tried booting into Recovery mode, I still can't access the drive.\nThe drive is fine, I can plug it into a Linux machine and I can browse the disc.\nHow can I fix this?\nThanks\nRich\n\nA: Ok something is broken in High Sierra disk utils (as of 2018/04/02). It seems unable to mount discs correctly. And I think crashes. I suspect it's something to do with the EFI partition but I'm only guessing.\nTo fix my problem I had to format the drive and start the backup from scratch. This did fix the problem.\nHowever you can not format the disc from disk tools, it crashes. You have to format it via the terminal.\nI followed this short guide.\nhttps://mycyberuniverse.com/web/how-fix-mediakit-reports-not-enough-space-on-device.html\nI then ran Time Machine and selected the new disc.\nNot quite sure how a bug like this manages to fly under the radar at Apple.

Just installed it. Let's see how it goes.\nWiFi is consistently dropping at random times regardless of network. \nQuestion : how do I fix it so I have a reliable consistent wifi connection when I use Windows 10?\nI have a MacBook Pro, purchased late 2017.  \nWiFi will randomly disconnect when I run Windows 10.  It works better on certain networks than others but it's always intermittent. Even on very robust networks it will eventually begin to drop. Once it drops it sometimes will simply not reconnect. Other times the drivers will randomly be disabled, not sure if this has to do with windows updates.  \nI tried manually installing and uninstalling drivers, rolling back drivers, installing and reinstalling the windows support software, and even using third party driver support software. Wifi connection still drops randomly with no perceivable pattern.\nI went to the apple store and I was simply told that this is a windows issue.  I had windows running on a MacBook air (2010) and never experienced these issues.  It also seems they haven't come up with an update for the driver in almost two years.

Recently, it has got the the point where the connection will drop out and reconnect 2 or 3 times per minute.  That was really only noticeable when using a VPN connection over Cisco AnyConnect - otherwise browsing just appeared to be very slow at times.  I found that disabling the WiFi and re-enabling it would provide relief for a few minutes.\nThings I tried that did not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing later drivers (not signed by Microsoft) Broadcom_BCM43xx_7.35.317.3-Win10 accessed from Search for Broadcom 43XX drivers - result 1\n\n*Unchecking the \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\" option on the Power Management tab of the Device Properties Dialog.\n\n\nI hope this works as well for others as it has for me...\n\nA: The bootcamp tools installation did not help.\nI uninstalled the driver and restarted the mac.

More specifically would it be possible to have Waze running on iPhone and use different apps such as music apps on CarPlay simultaneously? If not what does happen when some non-CarPlay app is opened on iPhone? Does the CarPlay go to home screen?\n\nA: It all changed with the release of iOS 13. You can now have a different app open on the phone and different on the CarPlay screen. Enjoy!\n\nA: Essentially, as soon as you use any other app, CarPlay will drop to its home screen.\nYou can have Waze running backgrounded on the phone itself, so you can hear its announcements, but you cannot enable it on the CarPlay screen.  \nWhilst doing this, you can return CarPlay to any of its own apps, music, map etc, or any of the specific apps provided by the CarPlay manufacturer - e.g. Pioneer [except for a bug in their AppRadio mode which breaks under iOS 11 making it totally useless.]\nThere's a video on the Pioneer site showing Waze working in AppMode... which I've never been able to achieve. It also shows 2-finger zoom like an iPhone, which my CarPlay cannot do, so maybe it's a newer model than my SPH-DA120.\nThis may all come down to the make & model of your CarPlay system, unfortunately.\nIf it's Pioneer, you won't get it working, until/unless they fix the AppMode bug .\n", "Q: How can I erase all photos on my iOS 11 device that can't be removed with Image Capture trick? I have over 17,000 photos sync'd from my Mac on to my iPhone running iOS 11. As seems these days, the synced photos do not give you the option of deleting them from the phone (yes, I understand this wouldn't delete them from my Mac). The problem is that I don't want all these photos on there, I only want the last few weeks or so but I think iTunes and the phone are confused as I'm not sure how to get rid of the extraneous photos.\nTo be clear, the photos in question are ones previously sync'd to the phone from iTunes on a Mac that runs the Photos.app; there are no photos in the camera roll. Photos that have been sync'd do not give the option to be deleted, that privilege only exists for those in the current Camera Roll. As well, the Image Capture trick suggested does not work because that method only addresses pictures in the Camera Roll; it does not see the sync'd photos.\nIn the past, I should have been able to simply uncheck the \"Sync Photos\" box and accept the \"Remove from Phone\" button, sync and then see the photos disappear from the phone. However, that doesn't do the trick - the photos are still there. I've tried re-enabling and sync'ing with a subset of photos which appears to complete successfully, but then when I try to uncheck and \"Remove from Phone\" and sync again, they still don't delete.\nIn the past you used to be able to go into the Settings app and under storage for Photos you could press a button to delete all photos from the phone; it doesn't appear to exist as an option anymore, only \"put everything on the cloud\" which is something I do NOT want to do. It just seems that iTunes sync doesn't try to remove the old photos like it doesn't understand that they're there.\nIs there any way to delete all the photos on my phone or do I have to completely wipe my phone and start all over again? Strangely, the last backup iTunes took of my phone was nearly 3 months ago and the button to manually do one is grayed out thus I'm a little hesitant to do the restore.\n\nA: I found the answer and it requires some surgery by deleting the sqlite databases that the iPhone keeps for synced photos, the photos thumbnails and the photos themselves. I've documented the steps in a blog page here: http://dronefone.com/brian/blog/Entries/2018/3/7_Removing_Synced_Photos_from_iOS.html\nNote this works for iOS 12 as well.\n\nA: As you have a Mac, the easiest way I'm aware of is using Image Capture. \nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac.\n\n*Open Image Capture.\n\n*Once the list of photos is displayed, hit Command ⌘+A to select all of them.\n\n*Hit the Delete button in the bottom of the window to delete.\n\n\nNot sure how long it'll take to delete 17,000 images so it may be an idea to do it in batches.\nOn a Windows machine a similar approach would be to connect your iPhone, open the DCIM directory in Explorer, select all files and delete.\nNote: This is also described in this answer by tetsujin.\n\nA: To remove photos that were synced from itunes, create an empty folder on your computer and sync photos with that empty folder.  \n", "Q: Finder displays wrong volume names, drive status (High Sierra) \nMy JetDrive volume is inexplicably showing as \"Dropbox Installer\" in the Finder.

From the Thunderbolt Display User Manual:\n\nConnect Thunderbolt-compatible devices for high-speed data transfer,\n  or connect another display that uses Thunderbolt. This Thunderbolt\n  port is not compatible with DVI, VGA, or DisplayPort displays or\n  adapters\n\nThe Thunderbolt Display must be used with the Thunderbolt port and cannot be converted from HDMI.  This is a limitation you can't overcome because these are two completely different signals.  \nFor the Cinema display, you need a mini DisplayPort (DP) which is not available if you plug in the Thunderbolt Display.  \nDaisy Chaining\nYou can't.  The Thunderbolt Display will only daisy chain to another Thunderbolt Display.\nUsing a Dock\nYou could use a dock like the OWC 12 Port Thunderbolt 2 Dock that has multiple TB ports out that includes support for video.\nThe problem with using a dock like this is two fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's already obsolete technology.  You're using tech that's already 5 years old and has already been surpassed by Thunderbolt 3.  This product will soon be EOL'd if not already.\n\n*It's expensive.  You're looking at spending about as much for a new monitor to get an obsolete device to connect obsolete monitors.\n\n\nBottom Line...\nYou are going to spend more than the Cinema Display is worth in adapters only to end of with EOL'd products.  (IMO) Your best bet is to sell your Cinema Display and use the procedes to get a newer, modern display that has multiple input formats like HDMI and DisplayPort.  This way, you can avoid all of the extra, unnecessary signal conversions and you end up with a monitor that will last you at least several years.\n\nA: Edit: I made a mistake, you can't daisy chain the Cinema Display to the Thunderbolt Display. See @Allan's answer above. The rest still stands.\n\nYou need to daisy chain the displays.\nThough finding information on this isn't the easiest, Apple did use to put this right on their features page.\n\nThunderbolt technology in Mac mini is phenomenally fast. It features two 10-Gbps channels for data transfer. That’s up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800 and up to 20 times faster than USB 2. But beyond speed, Thunderbolt gives you unprecedented expansion capabilities. You can daisy-chain as many as six Thunderbolt devices — including two Apple Thunderbolt Displays — to a single port. And since Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, Mini DisplayPort devices like the Apple LED Cinema Display plug right in, too.\n\nThis is probably the easiest and cheapest way to use multiply Thunderbolt displays too.\n\nWhy other things won't work\nJust to be thorough, I'm going to do a quick run down of why you won't be able to use some other solution besides this daisy chaining.\nSolution 1: Just plug one of those cheap Mini DisplayPort to HDMI converters in!\nThese cheap converters use what's known as DisplayPort++, a method by which DisplayPort actually send out an HDMI signal instead of a DisplayPort one. This means that the adapters can be \"passive\" and just change pins around, rather than having fancy (and expensive!) conversion circuitry to actually convert the video in real time. This means though that the adapters aren't bidirectional, and you can't convert from HDMI back to Mini DisplayPort.\nSolution 2: Use a fancy active adapter\nThere are active HDMI to DisplayPort adapters that don't use DisplayPort++. However, if the price didn't put you off (they're usually $50-150), the HDMI port on the 2012 iMac only supports up to 1920x1200. You could try using SwitchResX or mac-pixel-clock-patch-V2 to force the resolution up, but it's expensive and prone to failure.\nSolution 3: Use an MST hub\nIgnoring the fact that you have a Thunderbolt display (which requires Thunderbolt and not Mini DisplayPort), MST isn't supported on macOS. Sure, you could bootcamp all the time, but then what's the point of having a Mac?\n", "Q: High Sierra DNS fails intermittently for LAN-local hosts I have a local domain for my home network, which uses .loc as a TLD (not .local).

before buying if the game/app is 64 bit or not?\nI would like to know because 10.13.4 is displaying warnings about 32 bit apps/games. And probably 10.14 doesn't run 32 bit apps/games at all.\n\nA: If the app in question was updated after June 2015, or if it was released after February 2015 the app it's 64 bit.\nWhy:\nApple stopped accepting new apps without 64 bit support in february 2015 and stopped accepting updates to existing apps without 64 bit support in June 2015.\n", "Q: Finder Services - Cannot get specific service to appear/run I cannot get the default Finder \"New Terminal at folder\" service to work, no matter what. I've tried every trick I could find online.\nSo I created a new service and it appears in the Services list, but again, cannot get it to appear in the actual services menu nor does mapping a hotkey work.\nThe kicker is that this exact service was working for the last few months with no issues. Suddenly just stopped working. I haven't updated the OS or anything.\nI'm on Sierra.\nThe script is below:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n\n        set myWin to window 1\n\n        set theWin to (quoted form of POSIX path of (target of myWin as alias))\n\n        tell application \"Terminal\"\n\n            activate\n\n            tell window 1\n\n                do script \"cd \" & theWin\n\n            end tell\n\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\n\n    return input\n\nend run\n\nI really need this service to work, it saves me so much time and I really hate how it's not a reliable os feature.\n\nA: macOS Sierra has two built-in Terminal Services, New Terminal at Folder and New Terminal Tab at Folder.\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Files and Folders, and check one or both and add a keyboard shortcut if you’d like.\nThen in Finder you can select a Folder, right-click and select the service from the Services context menu, or from the Finder > Services menu or use the keyboard shortcut if assigned.\n\nThere’s no need to use AppleScript unless you really want to.\nHere's some example AppleScript code that works of me:\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set theTargetPath to quoted form of (POSIX path of (target of front window as string) as string)\n    end tell\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"pushd \" & theTargetPath & \"; clear\"\n        activate\n    end tell\nend try\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and aside from the use of a try statement, does not employ any additional error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted. \n", "Q: Waze and iPhone 5 I love using the Waze App with my iPhone 5, except for one very annoying problem:   while driving and Waze engaged, I listen to music on the radio, but I keep getting interruptions in the radio where the radio screen shows my phone name and phone number indicating I am calling myself.\nIt happens often and only when  I have Waze activated.  I don't know if it is a switch on the phone or something with Waze.    I would like it to stop because it's  very distracting and annoying.   \n\nA: If you navigate to Waze Settings > Sound & Voice > Sound Output, you can set how you want Waze to output sound. If you set it to \"Play on phone speaker\", then any alerts that come from Waze wont use your car's Bluetooth audio.\nAs for all the settings, Device default generally treats Waze audio like Bluetooth music audio, where play as \"Bluetooth phone call\" uses your car's Bluetooth phone call function. Playing from phone speaker bypasses the car's Bluetooth function entirely, preventing it from playing Waze audio through your car's speakers.\n", "Q: In Apple Mail, is there a keyboard command to shift focus from a message to the message list In my usual review of email, I have the message preview pane open and use the keyboard to delete, archive, or skip messages with the focus in the message list.  Sometimes I want to click a link in in an email.  When I'm finished with that, I usually switch back to Mail using ⌘-Tab.  In that case it takes a mouse/trackpad gesture to put the focus back in the message list.  Normally, I would expect to be able to use ⌥-Tab to shift focus between the panes, but instead, the focus moves to individual items in the toolbar and skips the message list.  What am I missing?\n\nA: You can enable Favorites bar where each element has shorcuts like ⌘1, going from 1 to 9. When you keystroke shortcut of an inbox its message list gets focus.\nIf you have multiple mail accunts you have to use corresponding shortcut for each inbox. This is not as ergonomic as a single shortcut would be though.\n\nA: On macOS Mojave, tab cycles between Mailbox list, message list, message and search bar. \n\nA: I've recently discovered that you can shift focus from a message to the message list with an awkward combination of two repetitions of ⇧⌥-Tab then ⌥-Tab.  I.e. you can't \"back up\" to the message list; rather, you have to shift focus to it in the \"forward\" direction.  It seems like there should be a better way to do this in a single keystroke.  If anyone knows a better keystroke or shortcut, I'd love to hear it.\n", "Q: In my google chrome for mac, CMD + Shift + r to reload the current webpage does not work? This Google Chrome keyboard shortcuts support page, in the Mac > Webpage shortcuts section, indicates:\n\nReload your current page, ignoring cached content:    ⌘ + Shift + r\n\nBut that keyboard shortcut does not work for me, my mac only beeps when I press those buttons.\n⌘ + r works as expected, but ⌘ + Shift + r only beeps.\nI'm lost how to fix this. Any ideas?\n\nA: In most cases, the reason is, that another application does already listening to the same shortcut.\n\nIn my case it was another running application called Be Focused (Pro) which uses the same shortcut (CTRL+CMD+R) defined as a global shortcut per default.\n\n1.) Try to close a bunch of running applications\n\n\n*\n\n*Try closing all other running applications. Even the apps which has only an icon in the macOS tray area.\n\n*Try the problematic shortcut after a restart of Google Chrome (chrome://restart)\n\n*If the shortcut works now, you know that at least one of the closed applications listening to that shortcut and prevents it from working in Google Chrome.\n\n\n2.) Try to open program for program and test the problematic shortcut in Google Chrome (after a restart) if it still works.\n\nWhen you found the responsible application, try to adjust their shortcut configuration.\n\n\nA: In my case, I need to Turn On my Developer Mode.\nTo turn on Developer Mode on Google Chrome.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Google Chrome.\n\n*Navigate to chrome://extensions/\n\n*Turn On Developer Mode on your Top right hand Corner.\n\n", "Q: Randomize Alert Sound Effect in Mac OS Is there any way to randomize the alert sound effect in Mac OS? In system prefs I am able to select which sound effect I want to hear. Is there a way for the system to choose a random sound each time?\n\nA: This isn't built into macOS so this is something you are going to have to script and do a bit of customization.  You will need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Custom location for your sound\n\n*Script to randomize the sound\n\n*launchd plist to run the script at a set interval\n\n\nCustom Location for Sound\nSystem sounds are in the /System/Library/Sounds directory which I don't recommend attempting to modify.  You can copy them to ~/Libary/Sounds or another custom directory of your choosing.  This way, you can add your own custom sounds without interfering with the System sounds themselves.\nScript to Randomize Soundfile\nThe script below will generate a random number between 0 and the number of files you have in your sound directory.  It will then create an array of all the file names and then select a random filename (array element) which it will then copy that file to another file called CustomAlert.aif.  You can customize the filename and path to suit your needs.\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# script filename:  randomAlert.sh\n\n#User Defined Variables\n  sdir=\"/Users/foobar/test\"\n  sfname=\"CustomAlert.aif\"\n\n\n#Remove Custom Alert Sound if already Exists\n\n  if [ -f ${sdir}/${sfname} ]; then\n    rm -f ${sdir}/${sfname}\n  fi\n\n\n\n#Get Number of Files in Directory\n  numfiles=(*)\n  numfiles=${#numfiles[@]}\n\n\n#Generate Random Number\n  rnum=$(( $RANDOM % ${numfiles}  + 0 ))\n\n\n#Put names of files into array\n  fnames=(*)\n\n#Copy file to Alert Sound File\n  cp ${sdir}/${fnames[${rnum}]} ${sdir}/${sfname}\n\nexit\n\nMake sure the script's permissions is set to allow execution:\nchmod +x randomAlert.sh\n\nFinally, make sure the script is in a \"safe\" location (a folder in your home directory is always a good place)\nLaunchd plist\nTo have the script run, you need to use the launchd service.  The plist can go in any one of 3 locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents - For just one user, run as the user (i.e. yourself)\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents - For all users, run as the user \n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons - As a system daemon (run as root)\n\n\nI recommend either of the first two; it doesn't make sense to run as a system daemon. \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n  \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.user.randomSound</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/USERNAME/Path_to_Scripts/randomAlert.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Hour</key>\n        <integer>00</integer>\n        <key>Minute</key>\n        <integer>00</integer>\n    </dict>\n\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nOnce you have copied it to the appropriate directory, you need to launch it with launchctl\nlaunchctl load com.user.randomSound.plist\n\nSet your Alert Sound to the Custom File\nIn your settings, set the alert to CustomAlert.aif.  Even though the sound will change, the name of the file will stay the same.\nThat's it!  Every 24 hours, your script will kick off and set a new random alert sound.\n\nA: Bash and \"Launchd plist\" both sound very frightening to me...\nSo I came up with a solution that involves Python and a cron job instead.\n(Shout out to the answer above and this other one: Change default alert sound from terminal in Mac OSX)\n\nI wrote a longer blog post explaining this in more details and using custom alert sounds:\nRandomizing the Alert Sound on a Mac\nBut here's the TLDR:\n1- You can set the alert sound via the shell.\nFor instance, this:\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/Sosumi.aiff\nSets \"Sosumi\" as your alert sound.\n2- You can iterate over your sound files with Python and call the command from step 1.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess, random, glob\n\nsounds = glob.glob('/System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff')\nsound = random.choice(sounds)\nprint('randomly selected sound: ', sound)\ncommand = 'defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/{}.aiff'.format(sound)\n\n# You could also define an array of sounds yourself,  \n# if you don't want every .aiff file to be a possibility\n# sounds=['sound1', 'sound2', 'sound3']\n# sound=random.choice(sounds)\n# command = 'defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/{}.aiff'.format(sound)\n\nsubprocess.call(command, shell=True)\n\n3- You can call the Python script from step 2 with cron.\nI use nano to edit my crontab file (but go ahead and use Vim or emacs if you're cool ).\nenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e\nAssuming you named the script from step 2 \"randomize.py\", adapt the path and put this in your crontab file:\nMAILTO=\"\"\n* * * * * python3 /Wherever/youWill/store/thisFile/randomize.py\n\nVoilà! You now have a script that randomizes your alert sound every minute.\nI run it every hour now, so * * * * * became 59 * * * *.\n", "Q: re allocate the Boot recovery partition space to the main system I am very new to apple, \nI tried look up answer but was afraid to mess thing up more and loose data so decided to ask for precise answer here.\nI have hard drive on my mac of 750GB, and decided to divide it to 2 partitions, 450 and 300 but then I deleted the 300G but these 300 GB now have been added to the Apple Boot recovery HD and I can't use it. \nI will attach a photo through the terminal.\nPlease let me know how can I reuse that space and add it to the main system hard drive.\n\n\n\nA: I'd make a backup of your system and then format the partition altogether.\nYou cant merge the boot recovery with the Mac partition. It's separate so that you can troubleshoot the mac if you need to reinstall it which is what I recommend.\nAs for resizing the MacOS boot partition to a smaller size, you can try this fix from this question: https://superuser.com/a/985499/841637\n\nTo fix:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Boot into the OS as normal.\n  \n*Open a terminal.\n  \n*Repair the disk diskutil repairVolume /dev/disk0s3 (where disk0s3 is your volume)\n  \n*Verify the disk diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s3\n  \n*Resize the partition diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s3 650M\n  \n*Boot into the recovery mode\n  \n*Open the terminal, don't use the Disk Utility\n  \n*Resize the actual disk diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 200G (where disk0s2 is the actual disk you want to resize, 200G is your\n  size)\n  \n\nJust make sure that your drive volume names are in place of the volumes inserted in the list above.\nSee if you are able to do this.\n", "Q: How to set a key to mimic clicking an app in the dock I have multiple desktops on High Sierra. Given an app window (like Safari) on each desktop, I can click on the app icon on the dock, and it will cycle through the desktops with this app. \n⌘-` will cycle app windows on this desktop\nCan I set a key to cycle app-desktops? \n\nA: This is the kind of task QuicKeys used to be very good at. \nPress a button, return cursor to its start point.\nIt's still available [will run in nag-free demo mode for a month, then go to nagware unless you buy it] & has instructions to install under more recent macOSes, but idk whether it's still up to the task.\n", "Q: How can I have Finder mount an SMB share from ssh without confirmation? In a bigger piece of AppleScript, I need to mount an SMB share. This works:\ntell application \"Finder\" to mount volume \"smb://server/share\"\n\nThat is, it works without asking questions, from the Script Editor or from a shell running in Terminal (ie. osascript <my script>).\nBut when I try to run the same script while connected to the Mac through ssh from another computer, Finder (I suppose) first asks for confirmation with a dialog on the GUI:\n\nYou are attempting to connect to the server xxx. Click connect to\n  contine.\n\nHow can I avoid this confirmation?\n\nA: As mentioned by @klanomath, the confirmation can be disabled by following instructions on this page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207112\nThat is, from a terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.NetworkAuthorization AllowUnknownServers -bool YES\n\nAnd then, to undo this change (for better security):\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.NetworkAuthorization AllowUnknownServers\n\n", "Q: AppleScript to Make New Calendar in Specific Account The AppleScript Dictionary for macOS Calendar 10.0 (High Sierra) appears to have no API for addressing specific accounts.\nFor example…\nset myCalendar to make new calendar with properties {name:\"New Girl\"}\n\n…creates a calendar \"On My Mac.\"  There seems to be no way to create a calendar in an iCloud or other calDAV account.  \nHave I had insufficient caffeine, or is the answer just plain \"No\"?\n\nA: You could use GUI scripting like this...\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click menu item \"iCloud\" of menu 1 of menu item ¬\n        \"New Calendar \" of menu 1 of menu bar item ¬\n        \"File\" of menu bar 1 of application process \"Calendar\"\nend tell\n\nBut one of the problems with this solution is you cannot set the properties of the calendar.

I have a lot of books in ePub and PDF format in iBooks on my Mac. I sync the next few ones I want to ready to my iPhone and iPad and read them there.\nIs there a way to set up a workflow so that when I finish reading a book, it \"goes away\" from iBooks, everywhere? I'd like the list of books to keep shortening so that once I'm done reading a book, I don't see it anymore.\nIt seems like a natural feature to have in a book reader, to not see books that one has already finished reading. Syncing of current page works great across all my devices, but automatically hiding / deleting read books is something that I'd like to have as well.\n\nA: Why not put the finished books in a folder?\nThat’s an easy way to get them out of the way. Also, since you are on a Mac you can easily export / delete / file them outside the app so you have a backup that’s easy to manage and a clean slate for new reading.\n", "Q: Management of security questions in AppleID authentication I have my AppleID, password and access to the email account registered to the ID. But I don't have the answers to the security questions. I have not used the account since it was set up in 2014 and I'm 99% certain that I didn't set up security questions at the time because if I had I would have used my password manager to create and store random strings as answers, and I have nothing saved. I can reset my password easily enough but I actually can't login. The option to reset security questions requires you to answer a security question!! Like doh, if I could do that I wouldn't need to reset them.I do think this is ridiculous. I got Apple support to phone me and the best they could suggest is change the password to a strong random one (it is anyway) and abandon the account! Anyone have any other ideas?\n\nA: You can go to iforgot.apple.com and then enter your Apple ID email address and then the captcha code there. Then choose continue and reset security questions. Next you choose how you want to reset it (get an email with a link or enter the password). Then you can change the security questions.\nApple Support can reset the password for you. All you need to do is to get verified. You need to attempt to sign in to the Apple ID site. When it asks for your security questions there is an option there that says Get Support PIN. Apple Support needs that PIN as 1 way to verify you. Then all they need next is one of the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*At least 1 correct security question\n\n*Text you a code to your iPhone or the phone number \n\n*Enter in some of your credit card info that is on file. \n\n\nAfter that they can reset the questions.\nBest of luck.\n\nA: If you have access to User ID, primary email, and password, you can regain access to your account if you have access to an Apple device.  You didn't mention if you have access to your security backup email.  If you go to iforgot.apple.com, you can tell them you forgot your security question answers, and they'll send a reset email to that backup email address.  If you don't have access to that email address, you either need to guess the answers or have access to an Apple device. According to support, if you don't have a device, there's nothing else they can do. The options in the other answer are no longer available if they cannot confirm your identity via the backup email or a linked device.\nIf you do have a device, or can temporarily get access to one, you can completely reset your account, questions, etc., with just your login and password.  If you reset the device (I haven't confirmed whether you can just add the appleid to an already setup device), you use just your appleid and password during setup. Under settings, attempting to access or change account information will bring up a prompt for the security questions.  There will be an 'I forgot' link at the bottom.  This will prompt for the identity check. Now that you have a device associated with the account, it will let you choose whether to email your backup address as above, or to push a notification to the device.  Select the device option, and a popup will appear with a code.  Enter that code in the other window, and you'll be prompted to create three new security questions.  Once that is complete, it will likely prompt you to set up two-factor authentication. If you don't plan to keep the device active, you can decline this and just setup the security questions with answers you actually know. You can also now log in at appleid.apple.com, where you'll be challenged with your new questions, and can then update anything else including the backup email address.

(e.g. by modifying the paste speed, if that is possible in terminal)\n\nA: You can use the pbpaste command to get the text in the pasteboard without going through the vagaries of the terminal driver, buffer overruns, etc. To put the cut text into a new file, use:\npbpaste >myfile.txt\n\nTo append, use >>, etc. Similarly, you can feed the pasteboard's contents to other commands as input:\npbpaste | somecommand\n\nAnd if you use the vi editor, you can insert the pasteboard's contents into your file with:\n:r !pbpaste\n\nBTW, there's also a corresponding pbcopy command to put text into the pasteboard. Unlike standard file redirections, you can use this to nondestructively modify the contents of the pasteboard \"in place\":\npbpaste | sed 's/foo/bar/' | pbcopy\n\n...and if you want to see the output as well:\npbpaste | sed 's/foo/bar/' | tee /dev/tty | pbcopy\n\n\nA: When I need to paste a lot of text into a Terminal application window, I use the cat command to transfer the text to a file. For example, I would enter the command below before pasting the text with the ⌘+V key combination.\ncat >myfile.txt\n\nWhen finished pasting text, enter the control+D key combination. This will terminate the cat command.\n\nNote: The control+D key combination must be entered at the beginning of a line. If not at the beginning of a line after pasting the text, then press the return key before entering the control+D key combination.  \n\n", "Q: \"this computer has been scheduled to go to sleep\" when none is set Simple question- My mac regularly & seemingly randomly tells me it has been scheduled to go to sleep automatically- usually (I think) right after I wake it up. I have no schedule for automatic sleep set up in preferences.\nWhen this happens I just shrug and cancel the countdown box but it is annoying. Is there any way to see what is triggering this message and fix it?\n\nA: If you are using iDrive that might be the culprit.\n\nA: I had this issue as well. I found two potential answers:\nThis one suggests resetting PRAM and the SMC:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7702633\nHowever, the second one mentions iDrive (as did a previous answer here). I did, in fact, switch to iDrive about a month ago, and believe the dialog box began appearing after installing it:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8304128?page=2\nThe above thread refers to a response from iDrive support which suggests un-checking the \"wake from sleep\" setting (it is apparently checked by default; mine was). For me, the issue was completely resolved by making this change; it has been 4 months since I changed the setting with zero recurrence. Make sure you don't miss the \"do you want to save changes\" dialog after changing it; iDrive has a way of making macOS feel like Windows.\n\n\nA: I have a Mac Mini running High Sierra and have it scheduled to wake up at 2am every day to do backups.  The problem was that it didn't seem to be sleeping again afterward (as it should after 10 minutes of inactivity according to my Energy Saver preferences).  I could tell this because the light on the front of the Mini was on, not pulsating.  It seems as if only the display was sleeping even though I unchecked \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\".\nI tried also setting a scheduled sleep time of 2:15am in the Energy Saver preferences, but that didn't help, plus I got a dialog when I turned on the computer at 7am saying that it was about to sleep in 9 minutes.\nI solved the problem by disabling the scheduled sleep time, extending the sleep timeout to 20 minutes, and adding the following line to my crontab (edit the crontab with \"crontab -e\"):\n15 2 * * * pmset sleepnow\nThe command makes the computer sleep, and the cron job is set to run at 2:15am.  I don't know if it was necessary to extend the Energy Saver sleep period, but I did this to make sure the cron job would execute before the Energy Saver preferences kicked in, and so far it is working for me.\nEdit:\nI found that my Late 2014 Mac Mini would then go into \"safe sleep\" after some time, and it wouldn't wake up according to the schedule.  Entering the following two commands at the Terminal fixes this by extending the safe-sleep delay to 1 day:\n1) \"sudo pmset -a standbydelay 86400\"\n2) \"sudo pmset -a autopoweroffdelay 86400\"\n(see here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6625408)\n\nA: I have had this problem since moving to High Sierra. The dialog box appears after I supposedly wake up the computer in the morning. I say supposedly, because the power light on the macmini is usually steady, indicating only the display, not the computer, is asleep. THe dialog always gives the same interval before sleep, something like 9 minutes and 28 seconds, which bears no meaningful relationship to the scheduled times in Energy Saver. It does not appear every day. I sleep the computer every night before I sleep. I have Schedule in Energy Saver set to wake the computer at 2:59 AM daily and put the computer to sleep again at 3:30 AM so it should definitely be asleep later in the morning when I get up. This Schedule is so a Launch Agent can run and download a TV schedule into EyeTV and there should be plenty of time for this to happen and the computer to go back to sleep, but it is clearly remaining awake. I have tried resetting PRAM and trashing Finder .plist with no result.\n", "Q: Syncing photo library to PC - Number of photos does not match I am trying to consolidate my photo library with my girlfriend's, across several devices. I am having some problems getting her iPhone photos to my PC. \nWhat I tried so far:\n1) I accessed her iCloud via browser. However, apparently you cannot download photos in bulk there.\n2) I installed the Windows app for iCloud that also has an add-in for the file explorer to download pictures. However, this app is outright broken. First, it stopped syncing after a certain number of pictures. I reinstalled the app and the app started syncing again, after the same number of pictures, but different MB folder volume. So there must be something off.\n3) I connected her phone via USB to my PC. Before, I made sure that I enabled the option to store high-resolution versions on the device, and not only on the cloud. I then transferred the pictures.\nHowever, I still have some issues:\n1) The folders were named e.g., 120APPLE and 100CLOUD. How come that there are two types of series of folders, one called APPLE and the other CLOUD?\n2) The number of items was completely off the count in the iPhone app. In the App, it was 7777 items. The count of transferred files was 7926. Also, if I only count the CLOUD or only the APPLE folders, I do not get the same count.\nAny ideas what could be the explanations for the two issues I am facing?\n\nA: Windows has an application called Windows Photo Gallery. I think Windows 10 has it out of the box, for Windows 7 you can download it for free from MS site (or at least you could). It is a MS try for local photos keeper, it keeps all photos in actual folders, not in a giant database. So I use it mostly for importing photos from the iPhone. It sees the device, shows all the photos by dates (and actually by events, can be several in a one day, pretty neat). I never delete old photos from my phone, so import finds them all every time. But you can deselect all and then select only for the last two days, for example.\nIf you have this application I recommend to try it.\n", "Q: Deleting Custom ringtones from iPhone / iTunes 12.7 I've followed the instructions from How to delete/remove custom ringtones (tones) from iPhone in iTunes 12.7?, but the ringtones are still on the iPhone after I sync, even though in iTunes the tones are no longer there. How can I remove the tones from my phone?\n\nA: You can delete custom ringtones right on your iPhone using GarageBand. \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch GarageBand on your iPhone \n\n*If you’ve never created a song on GarageBand, then you need to create one.

In modern HDMI based systems the volume control always happens at the destination (for example the TV). When you send the audio digitally, the source (Apple TV) is not amplifying an analog signal and thus has no impact on the actual volume except for any external control signals it can.\nYour computer monitor is probably not designed for use as a TV, and does not support receiving volume control signals anyway other than the on-screen menu. According to its manual, there doesn't seem to be any remote controls available or similar.\n\nA: As of May 2021 you can do this with a similar device. Google's 3rd gen Chromecast (and perhaps earlier models) supports this with an option to have the Google TV remote (as they call their remote) control the output volume level of the Chromecast, and hence the audio sent to monitor over HDMI. I found this option easily during Chromecast setup with a 32\"/QHD Dell monitor and didn't need to consult documentation.\nSo this is an Apple feature omission. I just received the new 4K Apple TV and went to set it to behave the same way as the Chromecast and discovered that it is not supported. Shame on Apple for not supporting something so simple and helpful. Being able to double up a monitor as a TV is a nice feature in a lot of settings.\nEdit: It's worth mentioning that the Chromecast will even connect to your Apple account and stream video content from it. (No Apple games or fitness routines, but not bad for the price. Kudos to Google, and I guess Apple, for enabling this integration.)\n", "Q: how to install Open Source Samba tool 'smbget' on macOS High Sierra? It seems smbget is not available on Homebrew.

I want to use Siri to record my weight in Apple’s Health app. However, when I tell Siri “Record my weight as X pounds”, she responds “I can’t answer that on your iPhone, but you can find it in the Health app”.\nIs it possible to record my weight in Apple’s Health app using Siri?\n\nA: It's not directly possible to say \"Hey Siri. Record my weight as X pounds\" currently (up to and including iOS 12).\nHowever, there are two ways you can do this(-ish).\n\n\n*\n\n*Siri Suggestions: if you launch the Health App (manually) and log your weight enough times, it will start showing up as a Siri Suggestion in Search. This will launch the Health App in the Weight section, and you can then log your weight manually.\n\n*Shortcuts: you can create a shortcut in the Shortcuts App. Use the Log Health Sample action, and select Body Measurements --> Weight. This will allow you to manually log your weight from a prompt. You can have it triggered by saying \"Hey Siri. Record my weight\". If you want you can make this more sophisticated with a combination of alerts/prompts and variables. It is not possible to launch a Shortcut and pass it input in the same statement (i.e. \"Record my weight as X pounds\", but you can launch the shortcut, and then have the shortcut use voice prompts and take voice input from you (note, you will have to convert text input to a number for the Health App). You will very quickly come to realise that Shortcuts is not a programming language, and gets clunky very fast. It's ugly (and fragile!), but it works (except when it doesn't)\n\nA: In the current beta of iOS 12 you can easily set that up.\nIf you log your weight enough times it will eventually show up in the following place:\nYou go into Settings -> Siri & Search -> More Shortcuts -> Log Weight (find via search if necessary). I use the voice command \"Log weight\" to trigger it. Works as expected. \nEdit: So you wanted to log the weight all in one command, my suggestion merely triggers the right input in the Health app, you then have to manually add the weight. \nIn the future, I suspect one could solve this by going through the Siri workflow app, but that App is not available yet.\n\nA: No it is not possible.

It install itself within an hour or something like that\n\nA: Uninstall all HP software from your computer. Usually the installer also provides an uninstaller. Prevent from automatic starting by removing those apps from Login Items under Users in System Preferences.\nThe HP print drivers from Apple directly are really good. And normally the official HP software is not needed to print, copy, scan etc..\nThere is a big memory leak in the software written by HP.. it has been for several years now. I have seen this issue many times.\n", "Q: Bash not recognizing packages installed using pip-3.6 I installed pip-3.6 using Mac Ports:\nsudo port install py36-pip\n\nThen, using this version of pip, I installed virtualenv:\nsudo pip-3.6 install virtualenv\n\nNow when I tried using virtualenv, bash isn't recognizing it.\nPS: I didn't want to select pip-3.6 as pip because I have pip working with OS X's version of Python 2.7.\n\nA: MacPorts may not have put things where you think, see here. Did the pip-3.6 command work? What do you get when you which pip-3.6? \nHave you considered Homebrew over MacPorts? pip3 comes automagically with python3.x with Homebrew.

Although I admire the new concept and see its benefits, I cannot put my head around one thing that puzzles me.\nI would like to enable the PHPMyAdmin tool, which requires me to change a file, based on this well described set of instructions:\nhttp://localhost:8080/dashboard/docs/access-phpmyadmin-remotely.html\nThis document basically describes the steps needed to relax the security concept that prevents directly accessing the PHPMyAdmin login. It asks you to edit the /opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf file in order to allow access to PHPMyAdmin. One can get to the file system via the stack manager. In this file, the following block:\n<Directory \"/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin\">\n  AllowOverride AuthConfig\n  Require local\n  ...\n\nneeds to be changed into:\n<Directory \"/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin\">\n  AllowOverride AuthConfig\n  Require all granted\n  ...\n\nStrangely, and I am extremely puzzled by it and cannot actually believe it, I seem to not be able to find neither pico, vi, vim, or nano (all very standard editors in any Linux distribution) on this virtual machine. Since I am on the VM, I have no access to tools on my own machine (i.e. everything in /Applications).\nDid I overlook something? What is going on? \n\nA: As the documentation suggests, you need to locate and edit the file: /opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf\nThe hard part for me was locating this file. The solution I found was to ensure the stack volume was mounted:\n\nFrom there, you can click the explore button, which will open /opt/lampp/. You can then navigate to etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf from the Finder window that is opened and edit with any editor you want.\nAlternatively, once the drive is mounted, you should be able to access the volume through Finder:\n\nHopefully, this helps.\n\nA: You should open xampp control panel click \"open terminal\" in the \"general\" tab, then do the following steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*apt update\n\n*apt install vim\n\n*vim /opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf\n\n*change Require local  to Require all granted\n\n*restart apache in service tab\n\n*open phpmyadmin\n\n\nA: You can edit the file directly from the host:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start XAMPP (VM version)\n\n*Mount the data volume:\n\n\n*Open Terminal on your host (Not the terminal accessible from XAMPP) and enter:\nsudo nano ~/.bitnami/stackman/machines/xampp/volumes/root/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf\n\n\n*change:\n<Directory \"/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin\">\n  AllowOverride AuthConfig\n  Require local\n  ...\n\nto:\n<Directory \"/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin\">\n  AllowOverride AuthConfig\n  Require all granted\n  ...\n\nand save the changes!\n\n*Start Apache and MySQL\n\n*Open a browser on the host and enter:\nhttp://<IP-VM>/phpmyadmin/\n\nThe default IP-VM appears to be 192.168.64.2.\n\nA: I 'solved' the issue by returning back to the non-VM version of XAMPP but then had to leave this solution altogether for other reasons (I was not able to scale from XAMPP). So, I used HomeBrew (yes, I am a Mac User) to install Apache, PHP (actaully 3 different version for different purposes), PHPMyAdmin, MariaDB and MongoDB manually and hand-configure it.\nI realised that these pre-build stacks are good and useful if you do not want to dive in and change them (or bend them). I will, in the future spend a bit more time an do it that way.\nThanks for all the feedback and attention. \n\nA: try this, it just worked for me with xampp vm on os x\napt-get install vim\n\n\nA: Try to update apt-get by using\napt-get update\n\nAfter that you can try to install\napt-get install vim\n\n", "Q: macOS no longer finding Windows Partition While attempting to remove a Windows partition through Boot Camp Assistant, the process ended in an error.

Can i use apple remote desktop to control a windows 10 machine on the same LAN ?\n\nA: While I do not know, if Apple Remote Desktop can be used to control a Windows 10 machine on the same LAN, I can suggest you use the following application instead.\nMicrosoft provides the \"Microsoft Remote Desktop 10\" application, which can be used to control a Windows 10 machine on the same LAN (or a remote LAN). The \"Microsoft Remote Desktop 10\" application can be downloaded for free from the Mac App Store. I should note that not all versions of Windows can be accessed remotely using \"Microsoft Remote Desktop 10\". For example, the Home versions of Windows will not work with this software.\nBTW, many modern PCs are \"Wake on LAN\" (WOL) capable. If the remote PC is capable of this feature, then you do not have to leave the remote PC on all the time. You can allow the PC to enter hybrid or regular sleep mode, then send a packet over the internet to wake the machine. A Terminal application command for doing this is called wolcmd. This command can be downloaded for free from the website: Wake On Lan for Apple Mac OS X 10.6+. I setup a service, so I can issue this command from the menu bar.\n", "Q: iCloud storage insufficient \nAs you can see whenever I try to backup my iPhone it tells me there is insufficient storage. All I want to do is backup my contacts and all super basic data in case something happens to my phone. I have backed it up a couple of times to my computer but I would like the more consistent back ups from iCloud.\n\nI have next to nothing stored in my iCloud like I honestly do not know what it is and so I cannot understand why it will not let me backup my phone. Then when I try to backup my phone even though I have every app turned off it says my backup will be over 5 gb. How do I make it so my backup is under the 5 gb limit???? I have looked at all the other forums and have not found anything helpful. It tells me my iPhone has never been backed up before. \n\nOn a side note can you tell me why Netflix wants to use 150 mb of my iCloud?\n\nA: Okay, so I knew it was going to be simple but for some reason apple decides that text messages should be backed up without ever explicitly saying so, so old text messages take up gigabytes of iCloud space.\n", "Q: Enable macOS \"Dark menu bar and Dock\" without password or restarting Is there a way to programmatically enable the macOS \"Dark menu bar and Dock\" option (found in System Preferences > General) via a Terminal command, without having to restart the Mac?\nThere is a way to change this option in the Terminal, but it requires the use of sudo and seems to require a restart, neither of which I want to use.\nI could do this via the Terminal using AppleScript, but as far as I can tell it would require GUI scripting and my having to allow Terminal to control the Mac in the Accessibility settings.\n\nA: Unfortunately, changing system preference files will always require administrative permissions, which is something the user has to explicitly give your script.\nFortunately, there is a way to accomplish this without changing system preference files! Using AppleScript, one can ask the system event daemon to change the system appearance.\nI'm testing this on my work laptop, which doesn't allow me to change Accessibility preferences, so I don't even know if Terminal is enabled there (I suspect it's not). Additionally, this does not do any GUI scripting!

The notification bar shows No Sim, which but this does not impact the device's WiFi.\nThe Common Fix: Resetting Network Settings\nI would like you to try: Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings\nWhich should clear up any issues by resettings the Network gear to their default settings.

Now lock the preference pane, and it will load back into macOS without fail.\n", "Q: Shortcut to select next item in a list On macOS, it is possible to select items such as checkboxes or even dropdown lists by pressing the spacebar when the item in question is highlighted (usually with a colored box around the item). The ability to highlight them (usually by default or by using the tab key) can be enabled with the Full Keyboard Access setting in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts (this feature can also be enabled by pressing ControlF7).\nI went to this website and tried to check out all of the fonts, which is done by selecting the font from the dropdown list. I wanted to quickly cycle through all of the fonts. I tried using the down arrow key to select the next list item when the list was highlighted. \nHowever, when you press the down arrow, the list \"pops up\"; you then need to press down and then press enter (or space) in order to select the next item. This effectively means that, to select the next item in the currently highlighted list, you need to perform three keyboard actions, which makes it extremely cumbersome to cycle through all of the items. \nI tried pressing the down arrow key while holding shift, alt, command, control, etc. hoping one of those would be a secret shortcut to select the next list item without, but using these modifies did not change anything. \nIs there a good shortcut to select the next list item?\n\nA: If you look \"closer\" at the fonts/names in the dropdown list you'll find they are being handled by server:\n\"patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Rectangles&t=Hello\\ world!\" \nThe option group's name (html) is \"optgroup label=\"Featured FIGlet Fonts\", one font e.g.:\n<option value=\"Rectangles.flf\">Rectangles</option>\nTherefore I assume they are sent by/to script\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./js/figlet.js\"></script> \nIt is certainly possible to delve deep into JavaScript and trace whatever commands it takes to solve this.\nActually I \"studied\" this page, tried AppleScript with/and Karabiner, but the list's behaviour is so \"nervous** \" that in the end I settled for a pure Automator/AppleScript solution:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Safari\"\n    if name of front window of application \"Safari\" is \"Text to ASCII Art Generator (TAAG)\" then\n        key code 125 --down… \n        delay 0.1\n        key code 125\n        key code 36\n    end if\nend tell\n\nActually this \"just-so-working\" code presumes you have selected the list, then press the shortcut shortly, let go, press shortly, let go, ...\n(** AS/Karabiner, via osascript, worked nicely & quickly – but only circled through fonts with same 1st letters … very irritating, possibly due to some settings in the js-script.)\nNow if this particular page is really important to you, try this: open Automator, goto    \nFile>New>Service / left window: Execute AppleScript / top lists L/R: No input / Safari (any browser).\nPaste above code into window. Safe as \"Fonts-down\" (for \"going up\" replace \"125\" with \"126\").    \nFinal step: open Sys-Press Keyboard Shortcuts Services (left) scroll-down to \"Fonts-down\", check and input your chosen shortcut (e.g.: Opt-D). It should now appear as (menu) Safari>Services>Fonts-down.\n(Depending on your general settings you may have to ONCE \"allow\" this script in Sys-Prefs.)\nOkay.\n– This script will only work in the specified window (important)\n– If you press too long (try it) fonts may be skipped\n– Sadly you'll have to choose a multi-key combo in Sys-Prefs keyboard, like Opt-D (Opt-U for \"up\"?)\n   (If you use Karabiner you may define a 1-key shortcut to call \"Opt-D\".)\n– This page is difficult to handle as its displayed content is created server-side.\n", "Q: Looking for command to display network usage on macOS ifconfig can be used on linux to check network transferred bytes in each interface like below:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:ac:11:00:05  \n          inet addr:172.17.0.5  Bcast:172.17.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:20782 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:16290 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:28527924 (28.5 MB)  TX bytes:1386216 (1.3 MB)\n\nthe RX bytes and TX bytes shows the current data transferred in the eth0 interface. However, the ifconfig on Mac doesn't show this information for me. \nIs there an equivalent command on Mac? I am looking for a native command without installing 3rd party library.\n\nA: Absolutely there is.\nI was going to suggest the GUI alternative, through the Network Utility's Info Tab or the Option + Click onto the WiFi icon in the menu bar to bring up current statistics. A set of easy to follow steps that are well-documented in this article.\nYou are however asking for a \"native command\" and thus interested in the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command: netstat -i : contains Incoming and Outgoing Packets (just another name for RX and TX). By default every interface returns its data but you can easily narrow it down using either netstat -i | grep en0.\n\n*Command: netstat -I en1 (note the capital -I flag) will produce an output for only that specified interface (here, en0). This is a more direct approach that does not require further filtering such as the grep operation above.\n\n\nLet me know if you have success with any combination of the above, or if there is anything you don't understand/want to refine.\n\nAdditional Explanation\nIn a comment, you mention seeing three lines of output when querying the interface using netstat -I, and ask how to handle that data. They are all the same values because they tie back to the same interface, read one line only (usually the first) and don't add them all together as you suggested.\nWhy?\nIn the Terminal output, those 3 lines are referring to the same interface because multiple addresses are associated with it. In plain terms, it is much like having multiple phone numbers forwarding their calls to your cell phone instead of ringing at their physical location.\nIn my case (on an iMac, querying en1), the first line's Address column shows the MAC address of my (ethernet) network card. Which is typically referred to as the most reliable out of the three entries because it is hardcoded and unique to the network card itself (hence won't change unless the physical unit is replaced).\nThe second line is (at least in my case) associated with an IPv6, while the third is an IPv4 address. These are susceptible to change depending on your network configuration and location. That's why the first line is usually the most reliable out of all. Think of line 1 as your cell phone to which lines 2 and 3 are forwarding the calls - it is also the only entry with error (Ierrs and Oerrs) logging.  \nWhy are the errors only logged there?\nWell, think of it as a direct reference/shortcut, if that's all they are (logical connections), they do not exist physically - the only physical interface is where the MAC address resides and thus the only location for packets to be verified and error reporting to take place.\nI really hope that made sense, I know you were just after the procedure at the top, but I thought a bit of an explanation won't hurt. Is that helpful in any way?\n", "Q: How can I search within documents from the Finder? I scan documents (receipts, etc) PDFs and the software does OCR to make them searchable. I can search them from within Preview, but I'd like to be able to search within the documents in Finder (or Spotlight). Is there a way to do this? Or a third-party app that does it?\n\nA: There is a free app, EasyFind, that will let you search files. Its available from the app store.

Since the internal HDD is dead, I want to use another disk, preferably an SSD. I do not want to go to a store at any point and so I looked into taking the iMac apart and replacing the HDD myself. Seems like a hassle that I would like to avoid if I can simply plug in an SDD into one of these three:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 3.0 port \n\n*Firewire port\n\n*Thunderbolt port\n\n\nMy question is that assuming I do NOT want to exceed $150, which one of these gives me the best speed such that I would not miss having an internal drive? Can a drive connected to one of these ports be enough to not need an internal drive at least speed-wise? \n\nA: There is no hard and fast rule for this. Sometimes when a HDD fails to boot, you can boot from another attached bootable disk. Sometimes, however, the HDD fails in a way it won't permit booting from attached drives because it seems to monopolize the bus.\nYou don't have USB 3.0 or firewire on this, even if it is a late 2011 iMac core i7. So you'd be limited to Thunderbolt or USB 2.0, which is going to be a little slow. \nI know iMacs are hard to take apart, but your best bet is to look at the instructions or video on how to install an internal SSD from Other World Computing (MacSales.com) or, iFixit.com. If you think this is possible, it's a cost effective way to really fix your iMac and make it a lot faster. \nedit: I wanted to add that USB 2.0 external HDDs are cheap and slow, Thunderbolt drives are expensive, and you can now get a decent SSD to install internally within your budget.\n\nA: Artiste212 is right. I believe the internal SATA bus connection is not compatible with older legacy USB format drives without a Swiss Army Knife with a SATA connector/converter. \nDefinitely not ideal for every day use.\nI did as Artiste  for my 2011 MacBook Pro. Replaced my system drive with an SSD first, then replaced the optical drive w/an internal storage 1 TB SSD. Just follow Other World Computing’s you tube videos. Extremely easy, but wow what a performance booster!!!\n", "Q: How to prevent High Sierra installation after the installer has already been downloaded? I'm currently on macOS Sierra. In order to get rid of the daily nag notifications to upgrade to macOS High Sierra I downloaded the installer, but have not installed it. I have no intention of upgrading at this time.\nI believed I would be able to locate the installer and prevent it from running using the steps described here, but I see no file named Install macOS High Sierra.app anywhere on my system. I know it has been downloaded because when I restart my system I am now asked every time if I want to do a regular restart or install High Sierra first.\nMaybe Apple has taken further steps to force the upgrade on us since the article was published, so that the installer is named something else or located somewhere hidden? I have searched everywhere I can think of, even with hidden files shown, and cannot figure out where this downloaded installer resides.\nWeb searches have just led me in circles through outdated articles. Any help appreciated.\nUpdate: Spotlight doesn't find the installer either.\n\n\nA: Default Location\nWhen the macOS High Sierra Installer is downloaded from the Mac AppStore, it, like any other application downloaded through the Mac AppStore, ends up in the Applications folder. The name should be \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\" (or its equivalent in your language).\nTypical Auto-Installation Prevention\nSince the first Mac AppStore-based Operating System (Mac OS X Lion) was available to download, the way to prevent an automated installation upon completing the download was to cancel (quit) the installer, open the Applications folder and move (not copy) the installer to another location such as the desktop. Having done this every time, including High Sierra (in September 2017), I can verify that it worked then too.\nWhy might it be beneficial?\nApple has always been known for staying top of security, rather than playing a slow game of catch-up. It's thus only natural that the latest macOS version is somewhat \"forced\" onto the user's computer. Afterall, for the majority of users, making the conscious decision of clicking the download button means they intend to install it right away. Unfortunately, though, there are many people who think that clicking the download button is all there is to it - that's where the application opens and a window pops up to tell them otherwise, showing them what must be done. To you and me, this is very annoying because we don't fall into the \"negligent\" category, but just imagine if people think they have the latest version and are up-to-date with Apple's latest technologies and security only to find out they were just half way there.\nWhat could you try next?\nI think we can both agree that if it hints at the High Sierra option at startup, it's most likely that High Sierra has been downloaded and does indeed reside somewhere on the mac.\n\n*\n\n*I would firstly suggest using Spotlight: Command +\nSpace Bar to make a search for \"High Sierra\", \"Install\nmacOS High Sierra\" or any variations of it both in English and your own language (should it be different). I have always had more success with Spotlight than the traditional Finder search bar.\n\n\nADDITIONS\n\n*\n\n*Please upload an image of the prompt you get upon restarting.\n\n\n*Perhaps something went wrong during the download procedure and the installer is not complete as a whole, yet some part of it thinks it is (perhaps a property file was written to too early), making it seem as though the update is ready to install when in fact isn't.\nFor this, I would first like you to navigate to the App Store folder at /Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/AppStore and check that directory (including subfolders) for anything that may be High Sierra related. You may wish to consider this article to resolve download issues. It may seem a little far fetched but worth a go if all else fails.\n\n\n*Check under the Purchases tab in the Mac App Store, that High Sierra actually appears. Are you sure you downloaded it, or are you simply getting notifications that the upgrade is available (as your comment may hint at)?\nLet me know how you make out and I'd be more than happy to assist further.\n", "Q: 15\" Macbook Pro: Radeon 555 or Radeon 560? How different is Radeon 555 and Radeon 560 in the 15-inch Macbook Pro 2017? Are there any notable differences between the two?\n\nA: Introduction\nI think we need to agree that both of these graphics cards are the best they have ever been in a MacBook Pro. Naturally, the type of card you require is heavily dependent on the work you plan to do with the MacBook Pro (you didn't mention it). If you don't yet own one of the devices and are simply doing some research before you buy (as one should), you may find the next generation (releasing around June 2018) may be a better alternative - ahh, when will the time ever be right!?\nNotable Differences \n\n\n*\n\n*The AMD Radeon Pro 560 has twice the memory of the AMD Radeon Pro 555 (4GB vs 2GB respectively).\n\n*The AMD Radeon Pro 560 has about 10% greater Clock Speed than its rival (925 MHz vs 850 MHz respectively).\n\n*The AMD Radeon Pro 560 has around 25% lower thermal design power (TDP) (75W vs 100W respectively, lower is better).\n\n\nReports\nThere are GPU benchmarking sites like GPUBoss and Notebook Check if you are interested in further reads.

For example, the \"iTunes + Remote Desktop Client + Safari + Security Patch 2018-001\" for macOS Sierra, which measures 1.12 GB, always starts off downloading from the ~365MB point. After downloading again, the update fails.\nIs there a way to clear the Mac App Store update data so that I can download everything afresh?\nI'm on a MacBook Air 2017 edition, running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\n\nA: There certainly is.\nI believe that I have worked out one of the best ways of going about such a task as I found myself having to do this frequently due to problems similar to those you are experiencing. I may just add that they stopped after the macOS High Sierra upgrade in September of 2017.\nGo directly into the Mac AppStore's temporary files folder:\n\n*\n\n*Quit the Mac AppStore completely (no updates running etc.)\n\n*Open Terminal and type: open $TMPDIR../C/com.apple.appstore/, hit the Return key.\n\n*A Finder window should have popped up with the files and folders in the \"com.apple.appstore\" location. Move (not copy) these to another folder (perhaps make one on the desktop) in case things go sideways, or (if you are confident), move them to the Trash right away.\n\n*Most importantly, do not delete or adjust any other files outside of this directory, when finished close the \"com.apple.applestore\" folder.\n\n*Relaunch the App Store.\n\nVerification and several other download issues should be fixed with these steps and you may find that you are once again able to properly download and install the applications fully (i.e. not starting midway).\nWhat next?\nI would further suggest running one or two sweeps of CCleaner for Mac (a free, trusted software) with options to fine-tune specific types of files.\n\n*\n\n*Open CCleaner\n\n\n*Go to Cleaner, select the Applications tab\n\n\n*Under Applications, check App Store\nIf CCleaner is run after completing clearing the AppStore temp files as described in the first set of steps, CCleaner will most likely remove any residual files and folders from the App Store that are only half downloaded or otherwise exhibit similar properties.\nIt just works!\nFor an additional read, this article explains my thinking behind the first suggestion, while this one may be a little more general.\nLet me know how you make out or if there is anything you would like me to clarify.

But it looks like Apple suppressed a lot of things in logs. \nI also found a command sudo log config --mode \"private_data:on\" to force display these <private> data, but this seems to work on OSX apps only, not on iPhone logs. \nSo unfortunately here, I came to a dead end.\nCan someone help me identify the corrupted file(s), force displaying more detailed errors, or tell me anything else I can do?\n\nA: From what you’re describing it looks like you have a corrupted backup on your laptop, I assume deleting it will get you to backup your device. What you can do to check is follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, navigate to your iTunes backups folder \n\n*The backup folder of your device MUST contain at least the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manifest.db or Manifest.mbdb \n\n*Status.plist \n\n*Manifest.plist \n\n*Info.plist\n\n\n\nIf you have any of these missing, the backup is corrupted or incomplete. In that case, simply delete this backup and start clean with a new iTunes backup.\nI’m also thinking it might be worth checking if any iOS app installed on your iPhone contains files with special characters in the filename -  they can cause issues while backing up (APFS related, yes…). \nI’m sure you’re fine with locating the iTunes backup folder, but just in case anyone else is having trouble here’s how to get there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Finder\n\n*In the Main Menu > Go > Hold alt key, Library menu item appears.\n\n*Click Library. \n\n*Navigate to Application Support/MobileSync/Backup and locate the iPhone backup. It should be a folder named with your device UDID.\n\n\nA: As I couldn't find and solve the problem itself, I decided to pay for the 50GB iCloud storage plan, and I've been able to completely backup my iPhone (including all photos and videos) to iCloud. After that, I've restored my iPhone to factory settings, updated it to the latest iOS and restored everything from the online backup after logging into my Apple account on my phone.\nPlease note that I only purchased the 50GB iCloud subscription, because I have thousands of photos and videos on my phone, which is much more than the free 5GB iCloud storage can backup. But, if you only use less than 5GB storage on your iPhone, you can do the same without paying for any subscription.\n", "Q: Are there ways to have Mac OS recognize my password \"better\"? Basically I am \"at odds\" with Mac OS on how to properly type my password.\nMeaning: when I used Linux (ubuntu with unity to be precise), I really didn't care about the \"state\" of my Linux box. If the screen saver/lock was up, I just started typing my password and hit enter. And ... I was logged in. Because the Linux screen lock was smart enough to understand that the string I typed + Enter is my password.\nWith Mac OS, on the other hand, I have to be much more \"careful\". I often find myself first type a letter, and press enter, and then when the input text field starts reflecting me typing ... I slowly type my password, and carefully press Enter. Because: if I don't do that, Mac OS will try to use maybe 5 out of 8 chars I typed. Or something else. So far too often, it takes me two, three turns before I successfully unlocked my screen. \nLong story short: is that me not fitting Mac OS (so I have to change my attitude of just typing pretty fast) - or are there ways to adapt Mac OS to my style of entering the unlock password?\n(And yes, when I have the lid open, I use the fingerprint reader, works fine - but within the office, the lid is down.)\n\nA: If you press the modifier keys (Command, Option, Control, Shift), it will wake the computer but not type anything, so you can press them as many times as you like without messing up your password.\nI usually just drum on the modifier keys until I see the password cursor, after having exactly the problem you describe.\n\nA: If the screen is asleep then just tap space bar (once only or the 2nd tap will be the first char of the password); then either wait until the screen wakes fully, or just count to 3, type your password, hit Enter.  \nIt used to work if you shook the mouse first, but these days it's space bar to wake, even if it's just the screen asleep, not actually the computer itself.\n\nA: Every time you try to enter your password incorrectly, it will reject it and highlight the incorrect try.\nSolution\nMash the keyboard (type random charcters) until you see characters appear, hit enter1 (accepting you will be incorrect), and then type the correct password (which will thus overwrite the highlighted incorrect password).\n1If you prefer not to hit enter (because maybe you have 3rd party software which locks you out after x attempts):\n\n*\n\n*cmd+delete clears the whole line behind your cursor\n\n*option+ delete clears the whole word behind your cursor\n\nWhy this is better than other suggested methods\nI find this to be the fastest way to get around MacOS not recognizing when typing starts, because you get immediate feedback on when input begins to be recognized--something you won't get if you just tap one of the modifier keys. You also don't have to needlessly wait extra time if it begins to recognize input quickly--which is what you'd have to do if you always wait 5 seconds after you wake, and before you begin typing, for example.\n\nA: Bad habit.  Waking the screen from screen-saver with the first letter of your password is an inherently unreasonable thing to do, for several reasons.  The first is that the computer may not yet have switched to the state in which the password-acceptance application is in focus, and the password box has keyboard focus.  \nIf the password-entry box is not in focus, then what happens to your keystrokes is disturbingly unpredictable.  Not least (on systems where security is an issue), it creates a huge security hole, where you have no typed your password into whatever application does have focus. \nIt was sloppy of Linux to allow this to work.  As others have suggested, wake it up with \"shift\".  Do not drum the shift key, or you'll be unhappy everytime you wake a Windows machine. \n", "Q: Major problem creating more problems, spiraling out of control endlessly: cannot install OS I started the day by receiving the following message, spontaneously:\n\nyour computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few minutes to continue starting up.\n\nSo I upgraded High Sierra. But the problem continued, I kept getting the message above.\nSo I uninstalled all my apps which came from outside the Apple store.  Throughout this process, the problem continued.\nFinally, I thought I might as well just reinstall everything. After all, everything I have is in one cloud or another anyway.

While it can be a software problem, it often is a hardware problem.\nFirst, run Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test. If no errors are reported, start from Internet Recovery, create a new partition on your SSD, and reinstall the OS.\n\nA: Your solution is to destroy and recreate a clean partition then perform a full re-installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue the command \ndiskutil partitionDisk disk0 1 GPT HFS+ MacHD 100%\nThis command will create a single GPT partition formatted for HFS+ with a name of MacHD.

Is there a way to change the password of an admin account from within the root account?\nI know about the option to directly reset the password through Recovery Mode, but this implies losing the passwords on the Keychain, which I want to avoid.\nAny help would be very appreciated.\n\nA: The password for an user account is stored separately from the keychain password. Usually both are the same password.\nWhen you normally change your user password, you have to enter the old password and the new password. The software then uses these passwords to attempt to change the password for the keychain. This only succeeds when the old password for the user is the same as for the keychain.\nIf you reset the user password without entering the old password, then the keychain password will remain the same. \nSo, if you do not know the keychain password, the only way to gain access to the keychain is to reset the keychain password. Unfortunately, this will erase the keychain.\n", "Q: How can I modify the default date format for \"moments\" in photos? I'm running photos 1.5. Older versions of Photos used a different date format for the title of moments. Right now most of my pictures are organized using the old date format (YYYY-MM-DD). Is there a way to modify the date format for all moments in the latest version of Photos?\n\n\nA: Check your format in System Preferences -> Language & Region -> Advanced... -> Dates and modify there by drag and drop the dates fields as you wish. These correspond to your locale settings. Note the format (YYYY-MM-DD) is not old, it is just the ISO standard today.\n", "Q: Console log is telling me that database is locked for many apps.

How is that conforms with Uber's case?\n\n\nA: No, the iOS app developers do not have access to your billing info.\nWhen an app is sold through the App Store, the third party developer does not get access to the credit card number, first or last names, your address nor the iPhone's name.\nAs a consequence of this, the developer cannot track reinstallations through the means of the above mentioned data.\n", "Q: Is it possible to edit a macOS alias with vim? I like to use macOS's alias feature to not have to make redundant files. These aliases work great with Chrome and TextEdit. When I open them with vim, however, I get a giant messy file (presumably the way macOS encodes aliases). Is there a way to edit the actual file through an alias with vim?\n\nA: macOS aliases are just normal files. macOS knows when an alias is being accessed and passes the right file along to the app. Since aliases are just normal files, other tools just open the alias file itself rather than reading the contents of the file and finding where it points to.\nIf you actually want a link to another file, you can create a symbolic link instead of using aliases:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I create a symbolic link in Terminal?\n", "Q: Is there a command on Mac can show the disk IO input and output stats?

For older OSX, you can ignore the following steps.\nTo disable SIP for dtrace (and iotop) for Mac OSX 10.10 and above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on or Restart your Mac\n\n*As the Mac is turning on, hold down Command-R to boot into Recovery Mode\n\n*Open terminal and type csrutil disable (this is a temporary step)\n\n*type csrutil enable --without dtrace.

Besides, Newer Tech battery that I installed in mid-December died (macOS thinks I don't have a battery at all).\nI ran Geekbench 4 on my machine after closing other apps (I actually left Dropbox and pcloud running, but closed Safari and itunes).\nIt turned out that my CPU score in Geekbench 4 is three times less than reported by another user with exactly same machine):\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/6882608?baseline=6473068\nThe only difference I can see is that I use macOS 10.13.3 while another user uses macOS 10.13.2.\nCan poor performance of my MacBook be attributed only to the difference in macOS version?\n\nA: No, minor differences in macOS versions do not have an impact of that magnitude on benchmark scores.\nIf you have battery and thermal problems with the laptop, you might be experiencing performance throttling in order to limit power consumption.\n\nA: The problem was that the battery somehow got disconnected: without a working battery my laptop was very slow.\nAfter opening the laptop and reconnecting the battery, it works fine again.\n", "Q: MacOS High Sierra - Unable to mount network drive after waking from sleep I have a 2017 MBP with MacOS High Sierra. When working from home, I typically connect to my work network via VPN and then I can mount various network drives (SMB).\nWhen my Mac goes to sleep, I seem to automatically lose my active VPN connection and any mounted drives along with it. Strangely, the VPN connection still appears active (the connection timer continues in the menu bar), although any associated functionality is lost.\nI can usually reconnect to the VPN without much trouble by disconnecting, then reconnecting as per usual. Unfortunately, I am unable to reconnect to any of the mounted drives. It seems as though my Mac falling asleep and interrupting the VPN connection places the mounted drives in some unusual intermediate state. If I attempt to reconnect to the mounted drives, I hear the system sound that indicates a successful connection and a finder window pops up, but the mounted drive is not visible/accessible.\nUsing Terminal, if I navigate to /Volumes, indeed I see the previously mounted network drives. However, if I attempt to cd into them, I get the following error:\ncd: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Socket is not connected\n\nIf I try to unmount the drives using \"[sudo] diskutil unmount [force]\", then I receive the message:\nUnmount failed for /Volumes/DriveName\n\nIf I run \"smbutil statshares -a\", then I receive: \nstat_share : SMBOpenServerWithMountPoint() failed for /Volumes/DriveName <DriveName>\nstat_all_shares : stat_share() failed for /Volumes/DriveName\nsmbutil: unknown status -1073741772: No such file or directory\n\nIt seems the only way that I can reconnect to the drives is if I reboot my computer, but this is quite disruptive. Further, although I'm not certain, I believe this behaviour arose following my upgrade to High Sierra.\nAny other suggestions for how to re-establish connection to these network drives?\n\nA: We have a similar issue with our network drives at work. When that happens the following works:\nHold down the OPTION key. \nRight click on the finder icon.\nLeft click on RELAUNCH. \nDoing this seems to clear out the cache. Then the system realizes that while it was sleeping, it did in fact lose the connection to the drive, and lets you reconnect.\n", "Q: How to unregister \"httpd\" after \"wfsctl stop\"? How does one properly unregister httpd from launching at reboot following a sudo wfsctl start and subsequent sudo wfsctl stop? \nBackground:\nwfsctl is a \"WebDAV File Sharing control utility\" released with macOS High Sierra. wfsctl is located at /usr/sbin/wfsctl.\nIn my case, after an initial install of macOS High Sierra, the Apache httpd daemon is not initially serving content. (This was expected.)  The observation that httpd was not serving could observed in various ways, including: \n\n\n*\n\n*type localhost into a web browser on the same machine\n\n*type curl localhost in the terminal on the same machine.\n\n\ncurl localhost\n# curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80: Connection refused\n\nWhen the wfsctl WebDAV services are started for the first time, then httpd is also started.\nsudo wfsctl start\n# ... \nsudo wfsctl diagnose\n# ... snip ...\n# All httpd processes:\n# COMM             RUSER             PPID   PID STARTED\n# httpd            root                 1   885  4:18PM\n# httpd            _www               885   890  4:18PM\n\nIt was not surprising that an Apache httpd was started.  Although, the baseline Apache httpd configuration also start serviing the contents of /Library/WebServer/Documents in addition to and separate from any WebDAV shares. In particular, index.html content is returned via either localhost in a web browser or curl localhost in the Terminal application.\ncurl localhost --verbose\n# * Connected to localhost (::1) port 80 (#0)\n# > GET / HTTP/1.1\n# > Host: localhost\n# > User-Agent: curl/7.54.0\n# > Accept: */*\n# > \n# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n# < Server: Apache/2.4.28 (Unix) mod_secure_transport/2.4.27\n# < Content-Location: index.html.en\n# <html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>\n\nFinally, stop the WebDAV services with sudo wfsctl stop, then reboot. After reboot, httpd is apparently still running:\n# after `sudo wfsctl stop` and system reboot ...\ncurl localhost\n# <html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>\n\nsudo wfsctl status\n# disabled\n\nsudo wfsctl diagnose\n# ...\n# WFS is not enabled.\n# ...\n# All httpd processes:\n# COMM   RUSER  PPID   PID STARTED\n# httpd  root      1    85  6:12PM\n# httpd  _www     85   414  6:13PM\n\nFootnote:\nIs it a reasonably expected behaviour that sudo wfsctl stop does not also unregister httpd? \nPerhaps wfsctl presumes to not interfere with other services with might be used to start the httpd web server?  (Though, in my use case, httpd was not enabled via any other means than wfsctl.) \n\nA: As noted in the question, sudo wfsctl stop does not stop and unregister the httpd process. However, the httpd daemons are stopped and restarted. Also, httpd remains registered to start on the next (re)boot.\nsudo wfsctl diagnose\n# All httpd processes:\n# COMM   RUSER   PPID   PID STARTED\n# httpd  root       1   325  8:46PM\n# httpd  _www     325   331  8:46PM\nsudo wfsctl stop\nsudo wfsctl diagnose\n# All httpd processes:\n# COMM    RUSER  PPID   PID STARTED\n# httpd   root      1   399 10:19PM\n# httpd   _www    399   403 10:19PM\n\nThe man wfsctl mentions that the use of httpd-wrapper is preferred to the use of apachectl and httpd (at least for the -t test flag.)\n\nThe Apache config file for WebDAV File Sharing is parameterized, and the httpd server is managed by the httpd-wrapper utility, which passes parameters to httpd. This is normally transparent, but note that to check the Apache config file syntax, do not use apachectl configtest or httpd -t. Instead, use httpd-wrapper -t.\n\nIn general, the options shown in the man httpd page can be passed to the /usr/sbin/httpd-wrapper ruby script. Most of the options work as expected.\nHowever, sudo httpd-wrapper -k graceful-stop behaves like a reset which restarts the httpd daemons and leaves httpd registered to start when the system boots again.\nFinally, sudo apachectl graceful-stop was found to stop and unregister the httpd processes.\nSo, the following command sequence will stop both the wfsctl WebDAV sharing and the httpd daemons on the current High Sierra.\nsudo wfsctl stop\n# Unloaded and removed: org.apache.httpd.webdavfilesharing.username-275.49176.plist\nsudo apachectl graceful-stop\n# verify\nsudo wfsctl diagnose\n\n\nSee \"How to set up wfsctl WebDAV to use with an application that uses basic authentication?\" for a more complete WebDAV example.\n", "Q: Deleting apple imessages So I did this thing. I sent this imessage and but the guy on the other end didnt have wifi I guess. It didnt say \"sending\" at the top and it didnt say delivered. So I turned on Airplane Mode, sent the imsg as a text and after it failed to deliver I held down on it, selected more then clicked delete. And now I'm paranoid and wondering whether or not he actually got the text. Can anyone help? \n\nA: Once you send an iMessage, if it is completely sent, it will be held indefinitely by Apple (not sure how long indefinitely is) until it is received by the other party. There are occasions where you won't get a \"received\" notice - if, for example, they have receipts turned off, or if they went out of range after receiving the message (happens on the subway here in NYC, where there is cell service for 300 feet, then nothing until the next station). Even then, it will sometimes send a receipt when it reconnects, but it's not perfect. \nWith SMS, it seems to vary by carrier. I've had messages that I know were sent but never received, and there aren't receive receipts for SMS. So YMMV with SMS.\nThe only time you really know 100% for sure is when you get the received receipt from iMessage.

Probably the easiest way is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Finder icon in your Dock (usually the very first icon)\n\n*In the Finder window that appears, click on your username in the Sidebar (see note at end if it's not listed)\n\n*Now go to View > Show View Options (or press commandJ)\n\n*Now tick the Checkbox next to the Show Library Folder option (it's the bottom checkbox - see screenshot below)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now your Library folder will remain visible as you were previously used to.\n\n\nNOTE: If your username is not visible in the Sidebar, then go to Finder > Preferences, select the Sidebar tab and then select the checkbox next to your username at the bottom of the Favourites list.\n", "Q: Does using one USB port reduce performance on others? This was a difficult topic to search for on the Web, so I'll try asking here:\nOn a MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) with 2 x USB 3.0 ports, if I transfer files to an external drive using one port, does this in any way \"eat up\" the performance of the other USB port? Or does each port have its completely own bus / capacity? \nA relevant side question is how the same applies to other multi-port setups such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*the USB ports on Cinema Displays\n\n*the USB ports on Thunderbolt Displays\n\n*the Thunderbolt ports on newer MacBooks\n\n\nA: I have often faced this interesting question. Apple has always tried to make its operations transparent - and although this is fabulous, sometimes this approach obscures information we want. \nTo discover how many busses your machine is running (as you rightly distinguish from mere ports) go to system profiler, and select USB on the left. \nUSB is listed amongst all the other protocols within your machine. \nYou will then be presented with a device tree which (usually) gives a pretty clear idea of what’s going on with the bussing. \nIf you plug things in to the ports you should see the devices come up. \nTo get to system profiler, select “about this mac” from the Apple Menu and the click \"system report\" in the window that comes up. Another way us to call up spotlight by pressing command and space bar together, type system profiler and launch it directly from there. \nWhen you are looking at the usb device tree you may be surprised to learn that the usb bus is also in use internally - for example on some older macs, Bluetooth was running off the buss internally. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: AppleScript Command Sendkeys? I am searching for an AppleScript command which is similar to Visual Basic Script Sendkeys command.\nI want to let a programm type something at itself.\n\nA: From the AppleScript System Events dictionary:\n\nkey code integer or list of integer : The key code(s) to be sent. May be a list.\n    [using command down/‌control down/‌option down/‌shift down or list of command down/‌control down/‌option down/‌shift down] : modifiers with which the key codes are to be entered\nkeystroke text : The keystrokes to be sent.\n    [using as above]\n\nSome examples illustrating their use:\ntell application \"System Events\"       \n    key code 124 using {shift down, command down} --> Right arrow\n    key code 8 using command down --> ⌘-C\n    key code {4, 14, 37, 37, 31, 47} --> H, e, l, l, o, .\n\n    keystroke \"v\" using command down --> ⌘-V\n    keystroke \"Hello.\" --> H, e, l, l, o, .\nend tell\n\n(Note: I stylised ⌘-C and ⌘-V with their uppercase representations, but these indicate Cmd+C or V, respectively, without use of the Shift key.)\nkeystroke can also accept the AppleScript constants tab, space return, and quote.\nThe target is always the application window that has focus, so it’s important to set the focus to the desired application before issuing these commands (e.g. tell application \"Finder\" to activate).\nHere’s a great reference for the keycodes as well as a detailed overview of these commands including more examples.\n", "Q: Disabling brief low-res PDF rendering on page transitions in Preview.app I like the built-in Preview.app, but when giving presentations (in particular, when using multiple PDF pages for animated page components such as with LaTeX-beamer) I am annoyed by the brief low-resolution rendering on every page transition.  After about one second, I am getting the desired rendering, but on every keypress, I am first getting an immediate, blocky pre-rendering.\nEdit: Here's a QuickTime screencast if the above is difficult to understand\nIn other programs, I find options such as \"pre-render next page [in presentation mode]\" or \"prefer quality over speed [when rendering PDFs]\", but not in the Preview.app preferences.\nIs there a hidden way to configure this, or any other solution?\n\nA: This seems to be a limitation in the underlying MacOS-wide pdf rendering library. I vaguely remember that this problem was introduced by Apple with some PDFkit rewrite (was it in 10.12?).  Before it was working just fine.  You can report this to Apple (and probably nothing will happen) here.\nExactly the same behaviour can also be observed with skim and it curiously also does not have such an option. As skim is open source you might suggest this improvement here.  Maybe the developers will tell you exactly which limitation it is.\nFinally, as I'm also annoyed by this and I did not want to install any Adobe products I found that Firefox can render pdfs just fine. If you open your pdf in Firefox and go to presentation mode with ⌥⌘p. This gives me the desired result.  A functional presentation view with no rendering blur on page transition.\n\nA: LaTeX (Beamer) and Preview are the keywords?\nThat is very likely a combination of suboptimal PDF output from LaTeX and buggy PDFkit, which is much too finicky with this. This bug was indeed introduced with macOS 10.12 Sierra. The effect cannot be turned off as this is the trick that actually makes macOS PDFkit apps \"scream through PDFs\". Any transition is rendered in much reduced quality until the image is supposed to be stable and actually viewd by a user.\nThe cause is likely the inclusion of many graphics files that each either needlessly or incorrectly contain a \"page group\" attribute every time.\nIf it is this problem, which is much more troubling in Sierra and a little bit better in High Sierra: then there are a few options to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use El Capitan for your presentation. \n\n*Switch away from Preview or all the other PDFkit based PDF viewers in macOS. Adobe products are indeed more robust for this kind of problem, Foxit or PDFExpert seem equally capable of avoiding that problem to an extent.\n\n*Reflow you source PDF. There are a few options for that. Expensive tools or opensource.\nOne solution might be to use qpdf with \n\nqpdf --linearize slow.pdf faster.pdf\n\n\n\n*Carefully prepare all the graphics that are to be included before pdfTeX includes them into the output file. It seems that the default workflow in most LaTeX to PDF conversions makes that problem much worse if the image converter used is ImageMagick.\n\n*If you insist on using Sierra or High Sierra: make sure that you really load a fresh instance of PDFkit based PDF readers. Reason: macOS often keeps a shadow instance of Preview active in the process list (probably due to how \"autoquit applications\" is handled).\nSee that by letting Preview autoquit or by closing it. It often vanishes from the Dock but is still listed in Activity Monitor. As this bug accumulates over time in its effects, force quit Preview (from Activity Monitor or with the Terminal command). A fresh instance of Preview behaves better than one that accumulated the error. On Sierra this is mandatory.\nMore information on this problem can be found in What causes incorrect PDFkit or blurry PDF display in macOS Sierra and how to fix or remedy that situation? and Multiple PDFs with page group included in a single page warning\nAsk Question\n\nA: For presenting PDF slides, I'd recommend SlidePilot. Renders each slide without the distortion on transition. Also has other nice presentation tools like a timer, preview of the next slide and notes.\n", "Q: MacOS freezes for a few seconds then logout? This question is related to one I asked before,\nOSX freezes and logs me out when switching workspaces, it doesn't happen everytime and it's not consistant?\nI did track the logs this time but it is a bit cryptic for me to go through, ( actually I have no idea what they mean at all ).\nThose are the logs while it was working up to it froze, maybe a little when it was actually frozen (••My__Mac•• is the name of my Mac): \nFeb  6 16:13:29 192 Memory Purge[4693]: [error] Connection failed.

I have added a simple trick (that you may already be aware of) to switch between input devices quickly and given an explanation as to why macOS behaves this way. I may not be the answer you are looking for but I wanted to share this information with you anyway, in the hope that it shows the problem from a different perspective or somebody is able to add to my thinking.\nTL;DR\nInput switching occurs when the new input/output device has microphone capabilities, which (in theory) gets the mic closer to the user thus produces greater audio and reducing background noise through less distance between the source and the mic - as the majority of headphones/earphones do with a built-in mic. This is how Apple views it and most customers don't want to put up with picking the right source every time they connect a pair of headphones.\nWhy might it be a positive?\nUnlike in the Windows world, where a Default Device can be set in the Sound Settings, Macs (unlike PC's) have a built-in speaker and microphone in pretty much every single (recent) computer ever released. Microsoft does not restrict Windows to a select group of systems (the way macOS only works on an Apple device, with the exception of unsupported Hackintosh builds). That is a major factor in the lack of flexibility when it comes to different ways of settings the input devices because if Apple knows an interface exists, it becomes the default (and fallback) interface - there would be no reason to think otherwise.\nApple, known for its user experience, has decided that for the majority of its customers, the headphone goes into the socket, it detects whether it has microphone capabilities, switches inputs accordingly and is in that way able to deliver and send clearer audio between the mac and the headset (the headset presumably being closer to the user now than the onboard microphone).\nA Common Workaround\nThe most common (and simplest) trick is to adjust the sound I/O interfaces themselves by switching to the desired device(s) through the menu bar.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the Speaker icon in the menu bar (if not present, go to: System Preferences > Sound > Check/Enable: Show volume in menu bar.\n\n*Hold the Alt/Option key and click on the Speaker icon in the menu bar.\n\n\n*You will now be able to switch between the devices as required. It may cost you a second or two of your time but it is by far a better alternative to messing with the system in other ways that may produce unknown side effects.\n\n\nConclusion\nI hope I was able to shed some light on Apple's way of appealing to the majority and the reason why they believe auto switching is better than the manual way. I understand this is a rather long-winded explanation of a simple no but it was important to get the point across anyway.\nMaybe you, like me, are able to forgive Apple for making an inflexible choice in their OS design that disregards a portion of the market's needs. I never found a reliable piece of software to prevent the switching so I learned to live with the quick menu bar trick and never let it bother me again. Maybe one day Apple adds a preference for preventing auto-switching of inputs.  \nLet me know if that was helpful in any way or if you have any other questions, I'd be more than happy to follow up with you on this.\n\nIs there a way to switch inputs via AppleScript?\nAbsolutely, there is! Let me show you how.  \nAppleScript \ntell application \"System Preferences\" to activate\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"input\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    tell table 1 of scroll area 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\n        select (row 1 where value of text field 1 is \"Line In\") --> Or change to \"Internal Microphone\"\n    end tell\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nWhat next?\nYou will need to allow the ScriptEditor to control your computer. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, then add the ScriptEditor/Compiled script to this list. This is an essential (security) step because your script is manipulating the GUI and in a way intercepting the window events. If you have no clue what any of that means, don't worry now, just paste the code into your ScriptEditor and run it - an error will tell you if anything was not done properly.\nPotential Improvements\nI'll leave you to your imagination but you could very easily make a toggle switch script (although the before mentioned menu bar trick pretty much does this already). One suggestion might be to find the Terminal equivalent and simply run a do shell script command through AppleScript. Such would involve looking for the .plist file which contains the current state (input selection) of the Sound Preferences and manipulating it to your choice. This is highly OS-specific and has a tendency to require the user to log out for the changes to take effect. With that method, I think we are simply looking for trouble where we don't need it. As the age-old KISS principle states: \"Keep it simple, stupid\" - sometimes it's just better to do the simplest task that anyone without the technical knowledge (AppleScript/Terminal) can achieve.\n\nA: I found a workaround that fixed it for me. OBS (free streaming software) appears to be able to assign a default input device. It works for me system-wide and even when OBS is not running.\n\n*\n\n*Install OBS\n\n\n*Provide OBS with the permissions it requests during setup.\n\n\n*In the Audio Mixer section of the main page you should see Mic/AUX. Hit the three-dot Menu > Properties > Device.\n\n\n\n*Select the device you want as your default.\n\n", "Q: Open text file in Numbers when it is space delimited, but some fields are strings in quotes with spaces I have a log file I'd like to open in Numbers to make sifting through it a lot easier.

However, some of those fields are strings, which contain space, so I can't just do a find replace for spaces and put the comma in.  One field, the date, is actually formatted like this: [06/Feb/2018:03:27:37 +0000].  This appears to be the only spot where []s are used, so I could find/replace those with \"s, but I'm still having trouble importing the document.

How does one go about setting up a macOS High Sierra wfsctl WebDAV server to use with application such as Password Wallet? Does any one have a good set of notes for setting up a wfsctl server?\nUse Case\nwfsctl WebDAV server now ships with macOS High Sierra. The context of this question is for mainstream macOS High Sierra, and not any macOS Server software.\nApplications (such as PasswordWallet) would use basic username password authentication to access a WebDAV server. \nBackground:\nAt this time, search on various apple.com urls only returned one result, \"Prepare your institution for ... macOS High Sierra ...\", which just states:\n\nYou won’t be able to set up file sharing with iOS devices in macOS Server 5.4. ... If you want to configure WebDAV sharing on a Mac with macOS Server 5.4, see the wfsctl(8) manual page. \n\nThe wfsctl man page (on regular macOS High Sierra) provides technical command information. However, the man page does not provide a example setup or getting started guide.\nSo far, internet searches for wfsctl use on macOS High Sierra has not yielded much additional information about using wfsctl.\nFinally, while there are many Apache WebDAV guides available, my initial wfsctl experimenting started with the unexpected wfsctl will start but not stop the related Apache httpd services.\nSo, does any one have a good set of summary notes specific to setting up a wfsctl WebDAV server and how to navigate through any \"quirks\" of a wfsctl system? (i.e. not general Apache WebDAV links.)\n\nA: Step 1. Host Address. Know the IP address or DNS Domain Name for the host machine. A static IP address or fully qualified DNS name will allow other guest machines to bookmark the host machine. If DHCP is used for the host machine, then the dynamic TCP/IP address will need to be known each time prior to connection. The IP address can be found in the System Preferences > Network panel.\n\nStep 2. Create Share Point Directory.\n# For example,\nsudo mkdir /Library/WebServer/ExampleSharePoint\nsudo chown $USER:staff /Library/WebServer/ExampleSharePoint\nsudo wfsctl share Volume/HardDisk/Library/WebServer\n\nStep 3. Configuration.  Edit /etc/wfs/wfs.plist. Set SynthesizeSharePointForUserHomeDir to determine whether to allow remote WebDAV clients to see their home directory as a share point. Default is true.  Use false to limit sharing to the expressly added share points.\n<key>SynthesizeSharePointForUserHomeDir</key>\n<false/>\n\nNote: CreateHomeDirsForLocalUsers and ApplyUserInstanceSandbox appear to be undocumented at this time.\nStep 4. Start wfsctl.\nsudo wfsctl start\n# Using identity with self-signed cert\nsudo wfsctl diagnose # verify\n\nStep 5. Setup Application Connection.\nIn the case of PasswordWallet, use the Network Sync Wizard to create a new sync.  Select WebDAV as the sync type.\n\nIf the server does not have a fully qualified DNS name, then the IP address can be used directly.\n\nStep 6. Stopping wfsctl and httpd.\nBased on How to unregister “httpd” after “wfsctl stop”? ...\nsudo wfsctl stop             # stops WebDAV. restarts httpd\nsudo apachectl graceful-stop # if desired, stops httpd\n# verify\nsudo wfsctl diagnose\n\n\nAddendum\nThe WebDAV share can also be mounted directly from macOS Finder. Menu: Finder > Go > Connect to Server… ⌘K.\n\nThe default auto self-generated certificate can be either temporarily or permanently accepted.\n\nFinder Share Point Folder View\n\nFinder Share Point Info\n\nObservation: Sometimes a file transfer via a macOS Finder WebDAV mount could fail and cause a loss of connection.  In these cases, so far, a second transfer attempt has succeeded OK.\nAt the time of this writing, the Password Wallet direct WebDAV synchronization connection has been solid and reliable for me. \n", "Q: Are AirPods damaging to your health? I was looking online and found links to two articles about the potentially harmful effects of AirPods on the body.\nThis is the first article.. It links to a video where the EMF intensity of the AirPods was tested and compared to other bluetooth headsets. It was concluded that they emitted a relatively high average EMF intensity. It allegedly also has a \"consistent field intensity... in the 7-10 milligauss (mG) range\" as opposed to a varying amount, which is apparently has a greater magnitude of effect on \"brain chemistry.\" Do note however that this site sells supplements, if that makes any difference in its validity.\nThis is the second one. It tests the AirPods (again, in a video) and sees that they emit EMF exposure which has a magnitude of 3500mV/m, which is ten times higher than an iPhone in a phone call (which is emits this exposure at a magnitude of 300mV/m). This also apparently continues to occur \"even when you are not on the phone and not listening to any music.\" The author even tries to give an explanation for why this is occurring (such as because they need to transmit information to your iPhone continuously as they can't process \"Hey Siri\" on the devices themselves). \nAs the first article suggests, this might be a cause for concern, given that these AirPods literally sit inside your ears and many people don't even take them off for hours on end (even though they continue to emit this \"EMF exposure\"). I definitely would do that if I didn't know anything about this (which the average consumer most likely doesn't). \nAdditionally I've seen information about the AirPods being a Class 1 bluetooth device (power output 100mW, theoretical range 100m, anecdotal range ~50m), which does seem strangely high for such small devices which stay so close to your body.\nApple's RF Exposure legal site doesn't list AirPods for whatever reason – only Macs, iPhones, etc.\nI'm not sure what to do here. I was on the fence about buying the AirPods but these concerns temporarily stopped me. If I should only wear them minimally to avoid potentially dangerous effects, it rather defeats the point of them in the first place, and it would put me off from spending $160 on them.\nI haven't been able to find any actual studies of AirPods, only the aforementioned articles from these two sites (and one or two other random ones). As a side note, it's quite hard to find specific information about this online, as different sites come to wildly differing conclusions. It also doesn't help that on Internet forums there are many \"armchair scientists\" who claim something as being true based purely on personal belief or what they read somewhere instead of in fact. It doesn't help that there are sites like this one which criticize EMF-emitting wireless headsets (with what looks like a picture of a person wearing AirPods), which is likely to promote their own product.\nI don't know how reliable the sources I linked in the beginning are, although I do know the latter was written by a \"trained electrical engineer.\" The first one however is on a site which sells supplements, one of which enhances the \"body's natural healing,\" which seems kind of fishy? I don't exactly know what to make of that one.\nI must say that I do doubt that Apple would make such a rash decision as to put out a device on the market which could be detrimental to a person's physiological health. I'm not sure whether these articles are just spreading FUD or if they have a valid point (the articles do seem somewhat 'sincere,' although that admittedly doesn't say much). \nWhat can I do? Should I avoid AirPods take these issues as valid concerns?\n\nA: The only question I could find in your entire statement is \n\nShould I avoid AirPods take these issues as valid concerns (sic)?\n\nYou posted info from sites that indicate it the levels of EMF emitted are both safe and not safe. \nApple has stated their products meet all applicable safety and health laws (although we all know these standards change over time). \nFor every site that I saw that stated it was safe, I found other sites (mostly natural-medicine sites) that said the opposite. \nSo to answer your question, it's completely up to you if you want to use them or not. I would say that based on the fact that you're concerned about this enough to do all this research (and still not come away with a definitive answer) that you should stay away from them and find another product that makes you more comfortable. \n", "Q: How can I access windows that become inaccessible when using two displays?

I have set it up with my carrier to use mobile data when away from my iPhone, but even though I’ve followed the setup steps ok, and my carrier says it’s all setup and working, it doesn’t seem to be working! :(\nThis is how I’ve tested it-\n\n\n*\n\n*Using another phone I dial my cell number and my iPhone rings.\n\n*I then place my iPhone into Aeroplane Mode and dial my cell number again, but this time it goes straight to my iPhone voicemail message. \n\n\nThis confirms my iPhone is off, but shouldn’t the call now automatically come through to my Apple Watch first before it’d go to voicemail?\nI’ve gone through the steps and I don’t think I’m missing anything. And yes, Mobile Data is enabled on my Apple Watch.\nHow can I fix this? Or is my Apple Watch faulty?\n\nA: Based purely on what you’ve described, your Apple Watch is working as intended. Let me explain…\nWhen an iPhone is in Aeroplane Mode, its Bluetooth is not necessarily switched off. This means your iPhone and Apple Watch are still in fact connected via Bluetooth and that’s why calls aren’t coming through on your Apple Watch. \nThe reason it’s been designed this way, is the assumption that if your Apple Watch is still connected to your iPhone, then your iPhone is in the same area as you (e.g. at home, at work, etc) and that if you’re not wanting to receive phone calls on your iPhone, then you’d also not want to receive them on your Apple Watch. \nTo test my assumption, you can either repeat your test but manually ensure that Bluetooth is also switched off on your iPhone. Likewise, you could just go for a walk (it doesn’t have to be very far - 50 metres is enough) so that your Apple Watch loses connection to your iPhone and arrange for someone to call your cell phone.\nIf I’m right your Apple Watch will ring when your cell number is called. However, if it still doesn’t work, let me know and we’ll investigate this further.\n", "Q: 2x TB from MBPr to display PBP on 4k monitor I have MBPr 13\" early 2013, as it does not support 4k at 60Hz, I was wondering if I can use both TB ports (max TB resolution is 2560x1600) to push image to a 4k display using picture by picture functionality? I would flip them vertically.\nAny experience with this idea?\nBackup plan is to pick up two 2560x1440 monitors :D\n\nA: Picture by picture does work, but window snapping to screen disables you from using the centre of the screen. Test the setup if you are thinking about it.\nI went with dual QHD screens and it works great. Also, the internal screen can be driven along them without any problem/\n", "Q: Open PDF from terminal using command completion I'm used to the linux way of opening a PDF from the terminal. That is, via e.g. evince sample.pdf. Command completion makes this fairly fast. In particular when there are many files with the same name but different endings (like after pdflatex compilations). From macports I have the bash-completion, but it is ineffective for the open command in the sense that I have to cycle through all files until I get the PDF one. Is there another way of opening a PDF that allows to employ the bash-completion? Or a way to make open ignore certain file types?\n\nA: open is a generic file-opener-thing so a generic completion for open must match anything open can open. One workaround is to invent a new command name, alias it to open, and then specify that the new command should complete PDF files.\nbash-4.4$ alias viewpdf=open\nbash-4.4$ complete -f -X '!*.@(pdf|PDF)' viewpdf\n\nYou could then use viewpdf to tab-complete-open PDF files. However this is rather incomplete as it only matches filenames unqualified with any directory path. With more complexity:\nalias viewpdf=open\nfunction _viewpdf()\n{\n   local word=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}\n   COMPREPLY=($(compgen -f -X \"!*.@(pdf|PDF)\" -- \"${word}\"))\n}\ncomplete -d -X '.[^./]*' -F _viewpdf viewpdf\n\nWhich should be saved into a bash rc file.\nIf you instead use the Z-Shell zsh the completion might look like\nREVERT=$options[COMPLETE_ALIASES]\nsetopt COMPLETE_ALIASES\nalias viewpdf=open\ncompdef '_files -g \"*.(pdf|PDF)\"' viewpdf\noptions[COMPLETE_ALIASES]=$REVERT\nunset REVERT\n\n", "Q: Three-finger lookup order wrong? When I use three-finger lookup, this is what I got.\n\nThe order of the results is wrong (i.e., different from my settings shown below), and many dictionaries are missing!\n\nHowever, I open the dictionary app and look the same word up inside, the order of the results is correct, the same as my settings.\nHow do I correct the result order of three-finger lookups?\n\nA: You can try disabling any dictionaries you don't specifically need. three-finger/force-click lookups only show a few results, not all of them. You can open the dictionary and search the word there as an alternative. This seems to be a bug on Apple's side, so there isn't much else you can do.

I got problem downloading icloud for my PC, so I access my icloud from icloud.com (mozilla browser). I want to free up my cloud storage, so I need to download all my photos and videos from icloud.\nProblem #1: I need to select one by one the file, cannot select all.\nProblem #2: After downloaded, I don't know when the photos/videos is taken. All properties is showing today's date. (media created, date created, date taken, date modified).\nIs there any solutions to avoiding a PC web browser from not respecting the file metadata (location / EXIF / date taken) stored in iCloud or a solution to read that metadata from the file itself and fix the filesystem dates that Windows provides?\n\nA: Problem #1: You'll probably need to download iCloud. Apps are almost always more fully featured than websites, because of their capability to access your hardware, and their lack of web security limitations.\nProblem #2: You may not be able to fix this. If you can't find the date anywhere on iCloud.com, or through the iCloud app, it may be data that doesn't exist.\nTips: Try using Chrome instead of Firefox. If you are on a Mac, use Safari.\nTips for getting iCloud app to work: Restart your computer. Turn off Windows Security Center and your firewall (temporarily). Don't forget to turn those back on when you have successfully installed and run iCloud.\n\nA: I would check that the EXIF data exists by using an iOS app like ViewExif or verify that the iCloud smart albums and search for a specific date still find photos with the date.\nAssuming you have correct data in iCloud - you can be assured if you were to borrow a Mac and use the Photos app to download a full copy of the library to an external drive you would have all the correct dates and metadata and could export the files out of the Photos Library to whatever flat filesystem organization you prefer and have correct dates on the actual files to match the date taken (for instance).\nYou could also upload one of the downloaded images to this tool to be sure all the EXIF metadata is preserved for the individual download.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://exifdata.com\nOnce you're sure iCloud has the data, now it's a matter of how much time it would take you to download and process all files using a web browser versus using the iCloud sync software Apple provides, Photos app on a Mac (borrowed / rented / owned) or if you can find a Windows tool to re-tag the date (in unix the touch command sets the modified date and you could script that) on the files downloaded.\nSo make it easier, perhaps make albums of 50 files to 250 files and try downloading the whole album to a folder.\n", "Q: Is there any keyboard shortcut for Play Later option in iTunes?

In Cambridge Dictionary, terminal has two meaning separately reference to computer and electrics.\n\n1) Computer, a piece of equipment consisting of a keyboard and screen, used for communicating with the part of a computer system that deals with information\n  2) Electricity, the point at which a connection can be made in an electric circuit\n\nWhich does 'Terminal' on MacOS derive from? \n\nA: If you are limited to these two definitions, the first is closest. But, historically, the application of \"terminal\" to computer systems derived from its more general use in the field of telecommunications. In that context, as Wikipedia defines it, \n\nIn the context of telecommunications, a terminal is a device which ends a telecommunications link and is the point at which a signal enters and/or leaves a network. Examples of equipment containing network terminations are telephones, fax machines, computer terminals and network devices, printers and workstations.\n\nThe first computer terminals were teleprinters (Teletypes) that had their origins with Samuel Morse and the telegraph networks of the 19th century. Terminal programs in modern operating systems connect to a channel called a PTY, or psuedo-teletype. These terminal programs emulate the physical terminals (teletypes followed by graphical displays) that once connected to a mainframe.\n\nA: A terminal is an endpoint of a process.  For example, an airport terminal is the starting or ending point for a flight.\nIn the computer context, a terminal was a device that functioned as an endpoint for data flowing (from the computer to the user or vice versa).\nA terminal window or terminal emulator functions much like these old devices.\n\nA: The first definition, as it relates to computers. See Computer terminal on Wikipedia.\n\nA computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system. The teletype was an example of an early day hardcopy terminal, and predated the use of a computer screen by decades.\n\nAs @8None1 elaborates in the comments below, the MacOS \"Terminal\" is more accurately a \"terminal emulator\" as described in the same Wikipedia article, since a terminal is a piece of hardware while the \"Terminal\" app is software that emulates that hardware.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp to generate Windows 10 USB key - Needs NTFS partition I am trying to use Bootcamp to generate a Windows 10 USB key (64GB). \nI use Diskutil to initialize the key as MS-DOS FAT with MBR.\nThe Bootcamp Assistant selecting the three options on the dialog box.\nIt all works fine, but when I use the key to boot and finish the installation it tells me it cannot install Windows on that partition and that it needs an NTFS partition instead.\nThing is, the partition was reformatted by Bootcamp Assistant itself before copying the WindowsSupport software to it:\nMacbookpro-2:~ silvano$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macbook HD              499.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macbook HD             +499.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 69E26A69-CF3B-4E39-B7F9-BC8154952589\n                                 Unencrypted\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *63.2 GB    disk2\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WININSTALL              63.2 GB    disk2s1\n\nBelow is the current state of my partitions.

The BOOTCAMP label should disappear.\n\n*Proceed to install Windows.\n\n\nYou have assumed the Boot Camp Assistant application can NTFS format a partition. If fact, it can not. Instead, the partition is FAT32 formatted with the label BOOTCAMP. You must click on the Format button during the Windows installation to NTFS format the partition. This removes the BOOTCAMP label. Later, when the Boot Camp Support Software is installed, the NTFS partition will be labeled BOOTCAMP.\n\nTo be clear, Windows installations on this model Mac must use the EFI boot method. This requires the installation drive to contain partition entries in only the GUID Partition Table (GPT). Both Windows and macOS (OS X) will only see the the GPT entries. Therefore, both Windows and macOS (OS X) with think the drive is GPT partitioned.\n\nA: All that is way too involved.  All you need to know is, when you get the error message, look at the options below the list box.  One of the options is Format.  Use it.

I have a Jabra Move bluetooth headset and a bluetooth Apple Magic Keyboard circa 2010/2011.\nI can pair them both with my 2015 Mac Book Pro (running OS X Sierra) with ease. However, as soon as I start playing audio through my Mac to the headphones one or both of two things happens:\n1) The music drops in and out \nand/or, worse\n2) The keyboard disconnects and reconnects frequently.\nIt's so frustrating that I mainly disconnect my headphones from my mac and stream music through from my phone.\nI used to have the same setup with a ~2013 Mac Mini and had exactly the same problem.\nI am in a busy office full of computers, phones and bluetooth and wireless devices.\n\nA: Problem: This could be caused by interference from the volume of bluetooth connections being used all around you. Macs are supposed to have support for up to 7 devices. However, your headphones COULD be using up multiple bluetooth connections. Mono headphones use 1 port, Stereo headphones use 2 ports, 5.1 channel surround sound headphones (if they exist) use 6 ports. Your headphones could potentially be kicking the keyboard off, or not connecting because the keyboard is using 1 bluetooth port, disabling the headphones from using all the ports they want.\nSince you're using a headset, you could have stereo input AND output, using 4 bluetooth ports.\nSolution: Use a cheaper headset, USB keyboard, 3.5mm headset, or contact Apple Support. Only they can help you if my solutions aren't satisfactory.\nOther things that could potentially help:\nResetting PRAM.\nRestarting your Mac.\nChecking your bluetooth settings. (Your Mac may be connecting to other peoples devices)\nHope that helps!\n\nA: What if you go away from Wi-Fi noise? The 39 bluetooth channels are splattered by the same spectrum as Wi-Fi - particularly the >=300Mbit/s 802.11n stuff and later will trip you up. It is definitely not bluetooth noise, however, as it runs the gamut from 1mW to 20mW, with most devices using 5-10mW. \nResetting PRAM will not help you.\nI have used several discreet bluetooth dongles to each handle bluetooth connections. With my macbook pro, bluetooth was weak, despite not being behind alu-casing (IIRC its antenna is at the top of the screen), so I used a few in USB ports. Problem went away forever.\n", "Q: After heavy use, my big iPad has charged very slowly. What can I do besides the Genius Bar? Is there a different wall charger I should use? During an inpatient stay, I had my 12.9” iPad Pro(Model A1652 EMC 2827), which I tried to use much of the time I was awake. The battery was depleted most of the time: I had it plugged into a wall charger, and power was never really more than 5-10%. It lost power frequently. I took it to the Apple Store and was offered immediate replacement. \nNow my laptop is in the shop, so I have been working from my iPad, and its apparent charging behavior is similar or worse. Besides that the charge has usually gotten down to 10% and stayed there during the day, an overnight charge while powered off from a wall socket only gets it to around 25%. I get the impression, possibly a false impression, that you ride it too hard and it becomes permanently sapped. \nI have read in other posts that iPads need more current than an iPhone, so possibly a different charger would help. Beyond that, what can I do beyond replacing it with an un-sapped model so it will charge from either U.S. or continental Europe power?\nThanks,\n\nA: iPads do need more current than iPhones, they have bigger batteries, and bigger screens. They consume more power because of this. If you aren't using a charger (block) of the same or higher capacity than the one included with your iPad. Considering this is a Pro model we're talking about, it'll probably have to be a higher voltage charger than a regular iPad charging brick. If you ARE using the charger included with your iPad Pro, consider getting it replaced. It may have given out from a power surge, or just worn out from constant use.\nTemporarily, however, you can power off your iPad while charging. I've had a similar problem to this with my Samsung Tab A 7.0, and powering it off allows it to charge. It will probably still charge slow, but it won't lose battery life, and will charge significantly faster than with it powered on.\n", "Q: Is it possible to turn off external displays when I close the lid of my macbook? By default, when I close the lid of my macbook, the external display becomes the primary. It is annoying because I have to plug out the cable and charger to turn it off but I'd like that whenever I close the lid of my macbook, it puts the macbook to sleep and turns off external display? Is it possible?\n\nA: As macOS doesn't provide a way to shutdown all screens by closing the laptop lead, which is a shame, you can put the laptop in sleep mode and also set security parameter to lock it immediately when it goes to sleep so you can leave once the screen is black.\nIf you have a MacBook with Touch Bar, you can also add the sleep icon to it :  \nI put it on the left to be sure not to touch it when i hit the fingerprint sensor or the delete key...\nTo modify the touch bar, go to system preferences/keyboard and you will find a \"customise touchbar\" on the bottom right corner.\n\nA: Putting the MacBook to sleep by using the mouse to select the \"apple icon\" in the (drop down) menu in Finder, and then select \"Sleep\" should turn off the external display.\nI use a MacBook with a MiniDisplay Port and USB monitors. I have the same behaviour as you when I close the MacBook. But when I put the MacBook to sleep via the drop down menu, all the monitors turn off. \n\nA: You can lock the screen and then cancel login window.\nShortcuts:\nLock screen: ⌘ + ⌃ + Q\nCancel: Esc\n\nA: Not really a solution, but if you just want a quick way to turn off your screens, closest thing I've found is using \"Hot Corners\" inside your screen saver settings.\n\nAssign bottom left corner to \"Put display to sleep\".\nMoving your mouse to that corner will make your mac sleep and turn off monitors.\n\nA: Command+brightness DOWN is what you need to press.\n\nA: If you have an external keyboard connected, you can try pressing CMD-Brightness Up.\nIf you don't have an external keyboard connected, you can press the power button on your display (if it has one).\nIf those don't work you'll have to:\nUnplug the HDMI/Thunderbolt cable going to the display from your Mac.\nUnplug the power adapter from your Mac.\nShut down your Mac.\nChange the input on your display (if available). \n", "Q: What is this no-name item in Activity Monitor's Energy tab?

This data is not cleared when an application is uninstalled; some apps may use one or both of the bits to flag devices which have already taken advantage of a free trial, or which have been blocked for abuse.\nThis API cannot be used to track specific devices, as it is too small to store a unique identifier.

I have had shell integration installed since many months ago. At some point, shell integration stopped working. (I'm not very observant; I just noticed it at some point.

Why can't Face ID feature be imported to iPhone 8, 7 etc. via updates?\n\nA: It's hardware. Go to Apple's iPhone X page, specifically the page on Face ID.\n\nTrueDepth Camera\n  A tiny space houses some of the most sophisticated technology we’ve ever developed, including the cameras and sensors that enable Face ID.\nThe TrueDepth camera system is composed of multiple innovative technologies. Working together in real time, they use a detailed depth map of your face to recognize you in an instant.\nDot Projector\n  More than 30,000 invisible dots are projected onto your face to build your unique facial map.\nInfrared Camera\n  An infrared camera reads the dot pattern, captures an infrared image, then sends the data to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip to confirm a match.\nFlood Illuminator\n  Invisible infrared light helps identify your face even when it’s dark.\n\nIt's not simple a software update.

I'm working on a native macOS app. I need to test some multi-monitor issues. When I'm at home I use AirPlay to my TV to test multi-monitor issues. But, when I'm at a cafe or co-working space if I could AirPlay to my iPhone then I could continue to work on multi-monitor issues.\nI suspect people might suggest Air Display but I'm not sure it lets me display to iPhone and reviews are very poor.\nIdeally I'd just like \"AirPlay to iPhone\" to show up as an option on my Mac.\n\nA: No, iOS on the iPhone does not natively support receiving an AirPlay display mirroring connection.\nYou can use third party iOS apps that employ other types of protocols with accompanying macOS apps that allow you to share the contents of windows from the macOS computer to the iOS device. AirDisplay, that you mentioned, is an example of this.\nIt is however not native AirPlay and thus has different characteristics.

Starting from this week, it is not charging fully.\nAfter a night of charging, it is only something like 95%\nIs that normal? Or is it a defect?

So I did a simple hard reset (hold down on the side button and the crown for at least 10 seconds or until the apple logo comes up) and that seemed to fix my problem.

I couldn’t find an answer here, so maybe this doesn’t bug anyone else. But surely it must?\nBasically, when using Apple apps such as TextEdit, Preview, Pages, Numbers, there is no Save As… option unless you hold down the OPTION key. This is just such a time waster and can’t possibly ‘add’ to the user experience. Plain dumb if you ask me.\nHow can I add this option so that it appears by default without having to press the OPTION key?\n\nA: The easiest workaround is to actually create a custom shortcut for Save As… using the same keyboard shortcut as the Duplicate option. In other words, don’t use the default keyboard shortcut of shiftoptioncommandS, but change it to optioncommandS instead.\nYou can do this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences…\n\n*Click on the Keyboard preference pane\n\n*Select the Shortcuts tab\n\n*In the lefthand pane select the App Shortcuts option\n\n*Now click on the + button\n\n*Ensure that All Applications is selected for the Application field\n\n*For the Menu Title field type in “Save As…”\n\n*Click on the Keyboard Shortcut field and now press the optioncommandS keys (remember, this will totally replace the Duplicate option from appearing in the menu). \n\n*Now click on the Add button   \n\n\nNow you’ll have the Save As… option by default in your various Apple app File menus. \n\nA: I'm assuming you mean by going to the menu bar with the mouse...\n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   S  will make a duplicate & append 'copy' to the name. This can then be saved in the regular manner.\n\nAlternatively, if you just use  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   Shift ⇧   S  it will go straight to the Save As... dialog.\n", "Q: Time Machine stops after a few gigabytes, without any visible error message I had to reinstall macOS recently, and ever since, I am not able to back up.

I recently downloaded a torrent directly onto an external hard drive, (using a 2009 MacBook Pro and 1TB Seagate Expansion portable Drive) somehow during the download the drive was accidentally ejected, since this incident when I plug the drive back in it’s having problems reading.\nThe drive works fine for about 10 minutes, I can read/copy/paste and access files but then starts to wreak havoc; apps hangs, it hangs the Finder, etc.\nI’ve tried repairing it in Disk Utility, which reads and repairs this disk but problems inevitably continue as described above.\nI’ve deleted the Torrent file also. All my files on this external drive so re-formatting is not an option until I can retrieve them.\n\nA: More than likely, the drive is failing.\nThere are several symptoms that point to this (downloading of the Torrent is just coincidental, not causal):\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive \"accidentally\" ejected.  By itself, this is not an indication of a failure as it could have been any number of factors that caused the drive to eject; from a power failure to user error.  However, in addition to the other symptoms, it lends credibility to the theory.\n\n*The drive works for about 10 minutes then hangs the system.  Good drives don't hang your system.  Additionally, if you system is fully functional (no hangs) until after you plug in the questionable drive, it's a good bet that the drive is the issue.  \nAs a test, try a different external drive.  If the problem goes away, you've (through the process of elimination) identified the issue.\n\n*It's a Seagate.  (IMO) Seagate drives are some of the most unreliable devices in IT.   Based on reviewing tech support reports for our departments activities, a vast majority of the hard drive failures were Seagate.  \nThough, that is my personal experience, it appears I'm not the only one judging by this PC World article from 2016:  Seagate slapped with a class action lawsuit over hard drive failure rates\nData Protection/Recovery\nYour best bet right now is to focus on data protection and recovery.  I have personally used Disk Drill for both diagnostics and recovery and it has worked extremely well.\nAdditionally, you should \n\n\n*\n\n*Make an image of the drive and work off that:\nsudo dd if=/dev/rdiskX of=~/Desktop/external_drive.img bs=1M\n\n\n\n*Stop using the external drive for daily use until you can recover the data. \n\n\nPersonally, I recommend Western Digital Passport drives.  I have one that I have been using a daily Time Machine back up drives for over 4 years with no issues.  In comparision, I had a Seagate that was given to me I was using to back up my Synology NAS, died about 18 months in; even free, they're (Seagates) not worth the trouble.\n", "Q: iOS 10, Messages has bifurcated chat history with my wife I can't figure out what's going on here, but my wife appears twice in Messages on my phone (iPhone SE, iOS 10.3.1) and I appear twice in her Messages on her phone (iPhone SE, iOS 9.3.4).  There are two distinct chats with each of us, but there is only 1 contact for either of us on our phones (in the Contacts app).\nI can't see any pattern to the chats either, There are messages between us that were sent with our iPhones, Macs, and iPads in both chats.  I can't see anything that clearly displays why either would be used at any particular time.  There's no pattern that I can discern.\nThis is also causing problems with chat history being properly recorded on our Macs.  Only 1 of these chats appears in Messages on our Macs, so there is a big gap of missing messages when we communicate using macOS.\nSo I suppose this is a 2-part question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How did this happen?\n\n*How can we merge these two chats into one so that we don't lose any chat history but going forward will have only a single chat between us across all Apple devices?\n\n\nEDIT:  To make matters even stranger - in further testing I sent a message from my iMac to my actual mobile phone number (rather than email address) in Messages.  The \"send\" side of the message (in Blue) went to one chat in my phone, the \"receive\" side (in grey) went to the other!  Both use the identical contact on my phone.  I just don't get this at all.\nEDIT 2:  I'm fairly convinced at this point that somehow, this is related.  Every time I send myself a message from either my iMac or MBP, by selecting my email address (and NOT my phone number), after I send it if I click on my name in Messages, it is set to my phone number again.  I've no idea why, but Messages seemingly simply will not allow me to send messages via my email address any more.\nEDIT 3:  More weirdness.  When my wife sends me a message, it goes to one of the two chats on my phone.  When I reply from my Mac, the reply comes from the other chat on my phone.  Even though both chats appear to come from the same contact (mine) and send to the same contact (hers).\n\nA: This type of behavior is usually caused by Messages between phone numbers and iCloud ID's (typically your iCloud email address). You can click the target user for a message at the top of the thread (macOS) and it will show which address it was exchanged with (phone or email). On iOS, tap the circle with the username or photo at the top of the thread and the \"recent\" tag will be on the address used for those messages. See if the two threads are different. \nAlso make sure your Mac is enabled to send and receive messages from your phone numbers on both Macs. This is not the default for the Mac, though it is for the iOS devices.\n\nA: It appears that I have solved this issue, and it also appears to have been connected to another issue I had thought was separate.\n", "Q: Problem with XAMPP after installation I have just installed XAMPP and when I click \"start all\" nothing actually starts since there is a problem with the some configurations (I do not have any idea of what those lines mean since I am a completely novice in servers).

Is it safe to get rid of those photos?\n\nA: Photos image files are stored in the following location in Mac OS:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\nThe ~ tilde represents the users home directory, if you’re going to use the Go To Folder command to access that directory, do not skip the ~ prefix.\nThe Photos Library package file in Mac OS X\nThis focuses on local image files and not anything stored within iCloud. These are instead accessed through iCloud Photo Library or the Photos app.\nHow to Access Where Photos Files Are Stored in Mac OS\nIf you are going to manually navigate to the Photos file location using the Finder you would use the following steps;\nOpen the Finder in Mac OS and go to your home directory\nGo to the “Pictures” folder\nLocate the file named “Photos Library.photoslibrary”\nRight-click (or Control+Click) on “Photos Library.photoslibrary” and choose “Show Package Contents”\nWhere Photos are stored on Mac\nOpen the folder named “Masters” to find the image files contained within Photos app\nPhotos file locations in Mac OS\nThe Masters folder contains directories of photos organized by date in year, month, and day subfolders. Within each folder are the image files from that specific date.\nNote if you delete a picture from the masters directory it will no longer be accessible in Photos app. This is not recommended for obvious reasons. Copy a file from the directory if you wish to edit it.\nThis package folder is not intended to be user-facing which is why it is hidden, nonetheless you can access your files directly if you so desire.\n", "Q: Could my Mac have loaded a web page without my knowledge?

Experimenting with various Unicode line characters (like ―) or a series of em dashes (opt + shift + dash) is not a great solution as the width of the \"line\" doesn't change with the width of the note window. And if you squeeze the window width narrower than your faux line, it will wrap. Ugh!\nHere's the best workaround I've come up with (it ain't perfect, but it works for me!):\n\n\n*\n\n*In Photoshop (or similar), make a new document of somewhere in the neighborhood of 2400 pixels wide by 6 pixels high.\n\n*Fill it with black.\n\n*Save as a .jpg (or .gif, or .png… it doesn't really matter) in a place that you'll have easy access to, like your Desktop.\n\n*In Notes, put the cursor on a new line where you would want the horizontal line to go. \n\n*Click to select the file you saved to your desktop, and copy it to your clipboard (command + c).\n\n*Head back to Notes and paste it in (command + v). You'll end up with something like this:\n\nWhat's nice here is as you adjust the width of the window, the horizontal line image will always span the full width:\n\nYou'll notice that the height of the line also changes proportionally with the window width… so you'll have to experiment with a size that works for you. 2400 x 6 seems to work for me. Here's a link to the file that I'm using, if you want to give it a try (right-click to download):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bcnfe7K.jpg\n\nBONUS PRO TIP: If you're using TextExpander (or similar) make a new snippet that inserts this line graphic so you don't have to do steps 5 and 6 (above) every time. I've got mine set to -----. Adding the horizontal line with this shortcut has become second nature.\n\nIf you do not have TextExpander (or similar) to make a new snippet that inserts this line graphic so you don't have to do steps 5 and 6 above, you can create an Automator service as shown in the image below using the following example AppleScript code:\nproperty hLine : (path to pictures folder as string) & \"hLine.jpg\"\n\nset the clipboard to (read (hLine as alias) as JPEG picture)\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n\n\n\n*\n\n*As coded, the linked \"bcnfe7K.jpg\" was saved in the Pictures folder within the Home folder as \"hLine.jpg\", so adjust it in the example AppleScript code as necessary.\n\n\n\nThen assign it a keyboard shortcut, as in the image below, I used ⌘L as it was not assigned in Notes.\n\nNow to insert the horizontal line in Notes, set the cursor where you want the line and press: ⌘L\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted. \n\nA: Hold down the hyphen key on the keyboard.

Can't figure out what's going on here, but my Macbook Pro (mid-2011, macOS Sierra) no longer remembers anything new in Messages.  Every time I quit and relaunch Messages, the history is right back where it was before I launched.  The last messages I have there are from Feb 4 (4 days ago) and anything since then is always gone.  I can open it right now, chat with someone, then quit & relaunch and everything we had said since launching the app, is gone.  I did just do an OS reinstall recently to try and fix some other random weird issues I was having, also repaired all permissions etc. though there was nothing to repair.  I'm stumped.\nEDIT:  Additionally, now every time I launch Messages, my own chat (with my contact) is defaulting to an alternate email address of mine, which is not iMessages enabled, so appears in red.  I can change it to my valid address, send messages do whatever I want... but again once I relaunch, it's reset to as it was before, with all new chats gone and seto to use a non-enabled email address.\n\nA: You need to click on the word Messages at the top of the screen (next to the Apple Logo) and then click on preferences and then Accounts. You need to click on your iMessage account (iCloud) and then sign back in to your account to reactivate the account.\n\nA: This was HUGELY obscure but it appears I've solved it.  If it stays solved for a few days, I'll accept this as the answer.  It involves one theory, and a number of actions.\nMy theory as to what happened to cause all this in the first place:\nA few weeks back I was troubleshooting some other issues, which had me swap SIM cards between our phones.  After swapping back, everything appeared to be fine, but I believe that in the background of iCloud somehow, it got scrambled as to whose phone belonged to which account.\nThis morning, I logged into my account on icloud.com and saw that all my various devices were properly listed as I would expect.  Then I logged into my wife's iCloud.com account, and to my shock I saw my devices listed under her account!  And none of her devices!\nI promptly deleted all my devices from her account and made sure that \"Find my (device)\" was enabled on all her devices - it was.\nThen in the evening when I had access to her phone again, I checked her iCloud account on the phone itself, and there were two iPhone SEs listed, with different phone names (the device name you can set in Settings).  I deleted the \"stray\" phone from her account, and things immediately appeared to go back to normal again.  My Macbook's chat history now opens properly and as expected, and also a separate (or so I thought) problem I was having, seems to now have been corrected.  Messages sent from any of my devices to her, appear only once in a single chat on her side, and messages sent from her to me, also appear in only a single chat.\nNo idea how this happened, or even if my theory is correct, but at least the problem seems to be solved for now.  Will see how it does for a few days before I accept this as the answer.\n", "Q: Messages brings macOS to its knees with soagent and callservicesd When I launch Messages on macOS and attempt to do anything at all with it (or even, it seems, if I just wait a while until a message is received) the two processes soagent and callservicesd start maxing out CPU and don't stop until Messages and they are all force quit.\nMessages is in effect now unusable on my Mac. My iCloud account is the only one that syncs contacts and the only one used in Messages (the use of multiple accounts in either case is suggested as a trigger of the bug).\nWhat can I do to fix this? Deleting and readding all of my Internet accounts is not an option. \n\nUpdate: The trigger for this behavior seems to be Apple's (terrible) spell check. I can use Messages without soagent taking over my machine until I mistype. But one mistyping, and Messages hangs for a while, and then soagent takes off and can't be stopped except by force quitting. \n\nSearching for errors containing \"contacts\" I get:\nerror   08:33:58.523010 -0500   accountsd   \"Cannot check access to a private account type: <private>\"\nerror   08:33:58.526106 -0500   accountsd   \"Cannot check access to a private account type: <private>\"\nerror   08:33:58.561595 -0500   accountsd   \"Cannot check access to a private account type: com.apple.account.AppleAccount\"\n\nand\ndefault 08:38:32.371678 -0500   AppleSpell  Rebroadcasting external notification ABDistributedDatabaseChangedNotification from process accountsd (<private>)\ndefault 08:38:32.405900 -0500   suggestd    Rebroadcasting external notification ABDistributedDatabaseChangedNotification from process accountsd (<private>)\ndefault 08:39:33.801123 -0500   ContactsAccountsService There was an error while trying to load accounts.

I delete all the files that appear in the find with the word 'chat' in them in the Preferences folder.\nThen, I relaunched Messages and get:\n \nThen I reboot.  Messages rebuilds and soagent stops eating my MacBook battery.\n\nA: Tentative diagnosis: There is a corrupt record (or structure) in the Contacts database. Downloading the database completely from the iCloud version ensures that the local version is clean.\nSolution:\nSee https://appuals.com/fix-mac-running-slow-due-addressbooksourcesync/\nA simplified version of the above seems to have done the trick for me:\n0) Quit Contacts\n1) Delete (after making a copy) all the contents of ~/Library/Application Support/Address Book/. Reboot (don't know if that is really necessary).\n2) Uncheck Contacts in the iCloud settings. \n3) Open Contacts (the contents will be empty)\n4) Check Contacts in the iCloud settings. Sync starts (incl. the grouping of contacts into labeled groups)\nThat calmed everything down, including the soagent, callservicesd etc.\n\nA: Have you opened the console and filtered for messages from \"MCContactsManager\"?\nIn the details of the message, you can find a reference to the contact causing the issue. Export this contact to a VCF file. Delete the contact and check that there are no more messages from \"MCContactsManager\".\nCheck for soagent and callerservicesd to decrease CPU load.\nAfter you see the drop you can import the saved VCF into contacts again and everything should be back to normal.\n\nA: As the issue is related to the spell checking feature I would suggest you to reset text replacement.\nYou can erase (or save, if learnt spelling matters for you) all files in:\n~/Library/Spelling\n\nDo not forget to kill the spell process (something like AppleSpell) but remember to quit Message.app before doing so.\nAlso try to delete all the entries (if you ever added one) by hitting minus sign in Settings.app > Keyboard > Text Replacement\nNote that your problem seems to be closely related to this one (as pointed out in some answers). To sum up the solutions discussed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.soagent/Data/Library/Preferences and delete (Drag to Trash) the com.apple.soagent.plist and then Restart the computer.\n\n*The second solution was pointed out by Everett.\n\n\nA: i’m not running messages, but this happened on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, late 2012, macOS 10.13.6, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB) just now.\nafter quitting Notes, soagent’s CPU usage returned to normal, and the fans quieted down.\n\nA: I was observing high CPU with soagent, callserviceagent, and accountsd\nI tried the spelling suggestion above and still observed some issues.

I have a MacBook Pro Retina early 2015 8 GB and Intel 6100 1536Mb. \nToday I used an HDMI cable to my TCL 55\" TV (TCL U55S6906 / Chassis NT667E-EU) and when running Mac OS X the text is blurry and only at 30Hz. While running Windows 10 it looks better but is still at 30 Hz. \nAlso, sometimes it goes black for a second or two, and sometimes it shows green lines and plays a strange sound.  \nMy TV only has HDMI but I wonder if I could get 60 Hz with a Thunderbolt 2 cable to HDMI 2.0? Does anyone know why it shows those lines and makes those sounds (which remind me of interference). \n\nA: \nCan I do 4K@60hz with my early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina?\n\nIt's possible but not exactly fun. I'm using a Sony 43\" 4k TV with HDMI 2.0 right now.\nFor some reason the MBP insists it can only run it at 30Hz, but with a piece of software such as SwitchResX you can manually add your resolution/refresh rate combination to the list of \"supported\" resolutions. You'll have to disable System Integrity Protection (which normally prevents system files from being modified - mostly for security purposes) to add custom \"supported\" resolutions to the Mac, which involves a reboot once to turn SIP off and again to turn it back on, all the while being more vulnerable than normal to viruses, although probably not vulnerable enough to worry too much as long as you remember to turn it back on.\nYou'll also need an active (Mini-)DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapter. The HDMI ports on the MBP are 1.4 and not fast enough, but the Mini-DisplayPort ports are fast enough. The active part is needed because otherwise it will pipe the same 1.4 as the HDMI ports if you use a \"dumb\" cable/adapter.\n\nWhile running Windows 10 it looks better but is still at 30 Hz.\n\nYou may have a BGR panel. Most monitors have a pixel order of (from left to right) red, then green, then blue, but some do it backwards and OS X doesn't seem to be able to handle it sometimes.\n\nAlso, sometimes it goes black for a second or two, and sometimes it shows green lines and plays a strange sound.\n\nThis happens to me too. I think my cable is going out but I haven't bothered to replace it, but you could try that.\n\nA: I have a similar device (Early 2015 rMBP with 16 GB running macOS Sierra 10.12.6) and can confirm that it will power an external 4K display at 60 Hz - it's supposed to power two external displays at 4K (3840x2160) in addition to the builtin display, in fact. However, there are anomalies on my side when it comes to the refresh rate depending on my screen setup. Also, MacOS does not let me choose the refresh rate for the 4K screen when it's connected through the Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable - other than feeling the difference, I only see the refresh rate in the system profiler.\nHardware:\nrMBP Early 2015 with macOS 10.12.6 and 16 GB RAM;\nDisplay 1 (old): 900x1440 via mDP-DVI adaptor and DVI cable; Display 2 (4K): 3840x2160 via mDP-DP cable\nScenario 1 = 1 desktop:\nrMBP is closed,\nDisplay 1 (old) is disconnected,\nDisplay 2 (4K) is the only desktop displayed at 3840x2160 @ 60 Hz\nScenario 2 = 2 desktops with builtin screen: \nrMBP is open at 2560 x 1600 Retina,\nDisplay 1 (old) is disconnected,\nDisplay 2 (4K) is connected with 3840x2160 @ only 30 Hz\nScenario 3 = 2 desktops without builtin screen: \nrMBP is closed,\nDisplay 1 (old) is connected with 900x1440 @ 60 Hz, \nDisplay 2 (4K) is connected with 3840x2160 @ only 30 Hz\nScenario 4 = 3 desktops: \nrMBP is open at 2560 x 1600 Retina,\nDisplay 1 (old) is connected with 900x1440 @ 60 Hz,\nDisplay 2 (4K) is connected with 3840x2160 @ 60 Hz\nTo sum up, this means that my early 2015 rMBP 13\" will only display 4K @ 60 Hz on the screen capable of doing so if either all 3 displays are active or the 4K display is the only active display. The refresh rate on the 4K screen is dropped to 30 Hz if it's one of only two active displays. This result has persisted despite restarting my Mac but I do not know if this behavior is limited to my example. If any reader has a logical explanation and/or solution for this, please post your answer.\n\nA: According to Apple's Tech Specs page for that model MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDMI video output\n\n*Support for 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz \n\n*Support for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz\n\n*Support for 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz\n\n\nWhile that page does not specify 4K resolutions via the Thunderbolt port, given the limitations described from the HDMI port I'd say probably not.\nHowever, macOS High Sierra has preliminary support for eGPUs (external graphics processors), so with an external chassis and a supported video card you may be (eventually) able to drive 4K at 60Hz.\n\nA: I connected my Macbook Pro (Early 2015) to my new 4k Dell monitor using a mini-Displayport to HDMI cable, and only got 30 fps, which I found surprisingly annoying. I switched to using a mini-DP to DP cable and got the full 60 fps.\n", "Q: Increase Font size in Thunderbird I have recently purchased an iMac to replace my 13\" MacBook Pro and am gradually setting it up.\nMy eyesight is fading, so I intend to use the bigger screen to improve readability.\nOne application I am having problems with is Thunderbird.

Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, etc. all have a keyboard layout called US International, which turns the right Alt key into a modifer that lets you type common symbols from European languages, as well as adding various dead keys. \nIs there any way to use this keyboard layout on a Mac? Macs do have a layout called \"U.S. International - PC\", but despite the name, it doesn't match the keyboard layout used on other OSes. It makes \" and ' combine with certain letters but otherwise doesn't appear to change anything at all and in particular, holding the right Alt key doesn't work.\nI don't want to have to memorize a whole different keyboard layout just for Macs, or hold each key and wait for a popup or whatever.\nThe Alt level of Windows US International, which I am used to looks like this:\n\nBut the same level on Apple's US International PC is a lot different and looks like this:\n\n\nA: You can make the Alt/Option level of Apple's US International PC behave like the version you are used to by creating a custom keyboard layout with the app Ukelele.\nFor reference the Alt/Option behavior of Windows US International is here.\nNote that on a Mac both left and right alt/option keys normally do the same thing, i.e. create special characters.\nPS  If in fact your right alt key does not produce any characters at all, then something is broken with your keyboard or software.\nAn experimental keyboard that tries to conform to the Windows version can be found here.\nNote:  If you want something like one of the Linux versions of \"US International\" which have a dozen or more dead keys for making a huge number of diacritic and other characters, then the Apple equivalent is ABC Extended, whose layout is however quite different.  For that see this earlier question.\n\nA: The closest you'll find on macOS is the English - Irish layout for áéíóú, you don't need to type alt+e+a for á, just alt+a. If you want to match US_intl character by character, you'll need to create your own .keylayout with Ukelele and drop it under /Library/Keyboard Layouts.\n\nA: You can use a layout created by community members, for example\n\n\n*\n\n*U.S. International wo dead keys by Tobias Müller, or\n\n*Us no dead key by WillerWasTaken.\n\n\nYou may have to compare and try them out to find the exact variant you desire, or maybe tweak a detail or two using Ukelele yourself.\n", "Q: How to login when I can't enter my password because \"e\" key on keyboard doesn't work My \"E\" key on my keyboard stopped working.

For this to work, Finicky should be your default browser.\nFinicky rules are specified in ~/.finicky.js.

My 2011 dual core i7 mini developed a logic board issue. I've acquired a quad core i7 2012 mini as replacement. The 2011 has a new 1TB SSD running Sierra OS. I plan to move the SSD to the newer mini.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the 2012 mini run with the 2011's SSD as is?

(I'm sticking with Sierra for app compatibility.)\n\n*If I need to reinstall OS Sierra on my SSD in the newer mini, can I simply install the OS \"on top\" of the current drive leaving data and files intact? Will that tune the OS to the new hardware and leave my user files alone? Or will it erase all but the OS (see Bonus Question)?\n\n*Or, do I need to erase the SSD and install the OS \"fresh\" for it to recognize there is a new hardware configuration to match?

I heavily use my iPad Pro with pencil to go paperless. This works perfectly, but printing to paper from any Mac app is still much simpler than printing to the \"paper-replacement\", meaning to an iPad app. I am therefore looking for a mechanism to make this equally simple.\nCurrently, I open the \"Print\" dialog in any Mac program, click on \"Open PDF in Preview\", then in the Preview app \"Share via AirDrop\", wait a moment until my iPad appears, find it, click it and then select on the iPad into which application to copy the document.\nIs there a way to automate this? Automator on Mac has no \"share via AirDrop\" action (even though it was announced on the WWDC a while ago).\n\nA: If you actually use iCloud & iCloud Drive, Print to PDF and then save the PDF to iCloud and it will show on your iPad. Thats why iCloud Drive is there.\nOr if you just have to use AirDrop, then: \nWhy not print to PDF then share the PDF via AirDrop? \nIt appears to be much easier using either method than to create an automation to get the same effects.\n", "Q: USB Hard drive has very small chance of being recognized by Macbook Pro each time it is connected, but works with other machines I have a WD \"My Passport\" 1TB external hard drive.

I realized that every other device I tested it on that worked didn't support USB 3. I just tested it with a Windows device that supports USB 3, and while it is better than the Mac, it still has a problem recognizing the drive. Interestingly, the Windows computer shows the drive as not supporting USB 3.0.\n\nA: I had the same issue with a WD Elements 2.5\" 2TB disk on my retian macbook with macOS High Sierra.\nMy assumption is that the disk \"fell\" off the USB bus and macOS instead of gracefully retrying is just giving up.\nIn my case the disk worked for an hour or two, but then I got the error that I should eject Disks before unplugging them and the errors in the dmesg.\nI guess this is a combination of macOS being not very forgiving and the WD on-disk USB controllers being a little wonky.\nI was using a USB3 hub between the macbook and the disk, so maybe that was the source of wonkyness.\nI have no ZFS drivers installed.\n", "Q: How do you get monitor to shut off when screen is locked? When I lock my screen, the monitor does not shut off, even though the display is set to sleep after 10 minutes.  I suspect it is because one of the applications running is preventing sleep.  Is there a way to tell the mac to suspend the monitor in this situation?\n\nA: Locking your screen and putting your display to sleep are two totally different things.  Locking your screen is preventing others from accessing your desktop and does not necessarily put your display to sleep.\nThere are a couple options for you to immediately put your display to sleep and lock the display:\nKeyboard Shortcut:  If you want to put your display to sleep, use the keyboard shortcut  ^Control⇧ ShiftPower Button.\nHot Corners.  You can also set a Hot Corner.  Just move your mouse to the desired corner and it will put your display to sleep.\n\nThe key here, to get the display to lock and go to sleep  is to make sure that you have your security settings set to require a password (from \"immediately\" to \"8 hours\").\n\n", "Q: When running a script from the scripts menu, where is console output captured?

Every now and then, I’ll notice the back of my Apple Watch glowing with a green LED light. It seems to happen sporadically and usually only lasts for a few seconds.\nWhy does my Apple Watch glow green sometimes?\n\nA: It's taking your heart rate.\nPer Apple:\n\n\"Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light. Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist - and the green light absorption - is greater. Between beats, it's less. By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate.\"\n\n\nThe green LED's actually are flashing hundreds of times each second so to you it looks like it's glowing, but it's not.\n", "Q: Not receiving Messages on macOS I'm not receiving new messages in the Messages app on macOS (High Sierra).

So this problem sort of occurred 'out of the blue'. \nThis is what sudo fdisk /dev/disk1 outputs\n Disk: /dev/disk1   \n\ngeometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE    0   0   1 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n*2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 - 1641025168] HFS+        \n 3: DA 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1641696952 -  155242608] <Unknown ID>\n 4: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1796939560 -    1269536] HFS+   \n\nUPDATE:\nI've managed to reformat the partition doing the FAT32 filesystem, this time naming the partiion only in CAPS as per @David Anderson's suggestion.

There were some noticeable differences from what you posted in your question and comments.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can not name a MS-DOS (FAT) partition System2. You must use capital letters. You can name an ExFat partition System2. \n\n*There is no indication you created a Swap partition when installing Mint. The Mint installer will allow this omission. Unfortunately, when I tried this, the installer crashed before finishing. The result drive configuration was exactly what you have posted in your question.\n\n\nIt is possible you succeeded in installing Mint, even though I failed. This could be due to differences in hardware. Or, I might have chosen a different Mint installation ISO file. \nI believe your Mint installation should have included a swap file. Therefore, I recommend you should reinstall Mint. You can use the instructions given below as a guide.\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the amount of Memory installed in your Mac. From the menu bar, select ->About this Mac. The pop up will display the amount of Memory. The image shown below is a example of this pop up.\n\nNote: For a better view of an image, either click on the image or open the image in a new window.\n\n\n\n*Install Mint. In the images shown with this step, the sizes will differ from what you will see. Also, you will probably need to substitute /dev/sdb for /dev/sda.\nWhen the image below appears, select \"Something else\", then select \"Continue\".\n\nNext, select partition /dev/sta5, the select \"-\" to delete the partition.\n\nSelect the free space created by the previous step, then select \"+\".\n\nIn the \"Create partition\" popup window, select the options as shown below. Substitute a \"Size\" value equal to or sightly larger than the memory installed. In step 1, I determined a memory size of 16 GB, therefore I entered a value of 17 GB. Finally, select \"OK\".\n\nSelect the remaining free space after partition /dev/sda5, then select \"+\".\n\nIn the \"Create partition\" popup window, select the options as shown below, except do not change the \"Size\" value.  The default value is the maximum available space, which is what you want. Finally, select \"OK\".\n\nSelect partition /dev/sda1 for the \"Device for boot loader installation:\", then select \"Install Now\".\n\nSelect \"Continue\".\n\nContinue with the installation.\n\n*When the installation has finished, you will see the image shown below. Select \"Continue Testing\".\n\nWhen the image below appears, hit the keyboard shortcut control+option+T to open a Terminal window.\n\nThe result should appear as shown below.\n\n\n*Next, you will need to enter some commands. These commands will make Mint appear in the Startup Manager as \"EFI Boot\". In the Terminal window, enter the commands given below.\nmkdir  efi\nsudo  bash\nmount  /dev/sda1  efi\ncd  efi/EFI\nrm  -rf  boot\nmkdir  boot\ncp  ubuntu/grubx64.efi  boot/bootx64.efi\nch  ~\numount  efi\nexit\nrmdir  efi\n\nAn example is shown below.\n\nNext, enter the command exit to close the window. At this point, you can shutdown the computer.\n\nNote: To switch between OS X and Mint, you will need to hold down the option key at startup and restart. Holding down the control key before selecting the arrow below an icon, will make the associated operating system the default.\n\n", "Q: Reminders added as Chrome link instead of Safari As said in the subject, every time I add a to-do in Reminders.app from the Safari 'share' button, it gets created as Chrome Link, rather than Safari.

For these instructions, see the Apple website: Use Windows 8.1 on your Mac with Boot Camp. When using these instructions to install Windows 10, you might want to consider the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to burn the Windows ISO file to a DVD. Some Windows 10 ISO files are large enough that you will need a double layer (DL) DVD. Older versions of OS X used the Disk Utility application to burn the contents of an ISO file to a DVD. With the newer versions of macOS (OS X), you can burn the contents of an ISO file to a DVD directly from a Finder application window. You use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Boot Camp Support Software to an external drive.\n\n*You already have a BOOTCAMP partition. Assuming your external drive installer has the correct Boot Camp Support Software, you should be able to install Windows 10 with using the Boot Camp Assistant. Insert the DVD and connect the external drive, restart the iMac and then immediately hold down the option key. When the DVD icon labeled \"Windows\" appears, select the icon then the arrow below the icon. If during installation, you boot back to macOS (OS X), goto Startup Disk under System Preferences. Select the Windows partition, then restart the iMac to continue installation.\n\n\nIf you do not want to use a DVD, then you can use the accepted answer to the question: How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?. If you are using OSX 10.11.6, then you can skip step 3.\n\nTo be clear, Windows installations on this model Mac must use the legacy BIOS boot method. This requires the installation drive to contain partition entries in both the Master Boot Record (MBR) table and the GUID Partition Table (GPT). Windows will only see the MBR table entries and macOS (OS X) will only see the GPT entries. Therefore, Windows with think the drive is MBR partitioned, while macOS (OS X) will think the drive is GPT partitioned.\n", "Q: High Sierra restored from ISO to USB drive stops at the stop sign I've restored macOS High Sierra ISO file (downloaded from Torrent) to pendrive (16GB SanDisk's Cruzer Dial) using Disk Utility, however when booting from it (by pressing Alt and selecting the drive), it stops on the screen which shows the white stop sign on the gray background.\nSo I've booted with verbose mode enabled (by holding pressing CMD-V at the start), but the messages aren't clear on what it's failing.\nFew messages from scrambled screen are:\n\nIOUSBHostDevice::message: kUSBHostMessageRemoteWake\n  IOUSBHostDevice::forcePowerGated: kPowerStateSuspended completed with 0x00000000 after 15ms\n\n\nNote: The above black screen is showing booting still in progress.\n\n\n\nI don't know how to read these scrambled screens.

And on that panel, we can navigate around with the arrow keys and press enter to type in the selected emoji. I am wondering if there are ways that I can navigate through without having my hands leaving the main keyboard. Or in other words, to press the arrow keys you always need to move your right hand to the arrow keys, which is kind of inconvenient. I think the ideal case would be using vim's hjkl to navigate. But not very sure how to configure.\nAnd moreover, I have a touch bar on my mac, is there a way to have the emojis always displayed on the touch bar whenever I type? Because now I need to press the face icon first and then will the emojis show up on the touch bar, and this also seems not that convenient. I just hope the emojis could standby on the touch bar all the time.\n\nA: The quickest way for me is to simply search for the emoji. After you use the shortcut, just simply start typing keywords to find your desired emoji. \n\nA: Pressing Tab and Shift+Tab acts as page down and up.\n\nA: After searching for a while, I found something very interesting to use and perfectly suits my needs.\njsumners from github has built a alfred workflow which provides you with quick emoji access. The link to the repo.\nThis is super easy to use and loads way faster than the mac default emoji panel.\nAnd also do check this alfred emoji pack out! It provides emoji typing in an 'text-replacement' way. So you can type in some keywords in wherever in the system and alfred will replace that string with the corresponding emoji.\n", "Q: Securely erase all user data on an old iBook I have an old iBook (Model A1007) that I would like to donate, but first I need to delete all of the last user's data so that it is not recoverable. With Windows machines, I usually do this by running a live Linux USB or CD and then using the \"shred\" tool to overwrite the hard drive some number of times with random data.\nUnfortunately, I have been having trouble running live Linux on this Mac, as per this post: booting an iBook from a live linux usb drive. Booting from a CD instead hasn't seemed to have given me more useful results.\nIt seems that if I were to purchase the Mac OS 10.4 installer disk, it might be able to do what I need, though since I am doing this just to get rid of the computer, it seems like a bit of an excessive investment for what I am trying to do.\nMy problem is similar to this one: Securely wipe all user data from iBook G4 / OSX 10.4?. That user had three proposed solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the computer to another Mac. I'd rather not, as I don't have another Mac.\n\n*Clone the entire computer to an external disk and then run it off that. This seems like it is going to likely be a big project involving lots of debugging (and somehow finding a blank external hard drive, which I would prefer to avoid as well).\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there some free way to either run Linux on this old iBook and use that to wipe the data?\n\n*If not, is there some other free way to securely delete the data from the iBook?\n\n*If neither 1 nor 2, is there a way that will minimize hassle and expense to clean this computer so that I can get rid of it?\nI'm not above breaking this thing open and physically destroying the hard drive, if I must. I'd just rather use software means if its possible (and not too expensive).\n\nA: You can use the Disk Utility program supplied by Apple - and you can tell it how many overwrites you wish it to do, the last time I read that info it said one pass was not very reliable, 7 should be fine and 35 was overkill - bear in mind how long it takes to do one complete pass....\nA similar question is here : Selling a Macbook Pro - removing personal information from it\nEdit: You need to boot from a different media as it cannot work on itself so, either the original install disc or a newer install disk for a later version - as older ones don’t usually work forwards... Other bootable media may also work - but that I have not tried...\n\nA: You need to boot the iBook from supported boot media (like a compatible or retail PPC Mac OS X installer CD or DVD) to do this. Another way is using PPC compatible Linux, but an older version for the G4 CPU. Ubuntu 9.x is a good candidate, as is YellowDog Linux. Gentoo is known to have a working ISO image, ready to burn, but that probably is harder to track down. Booting from USB was not really supported, some OpenFirmware versions did make it available, but it was flaky at best. Machines that were the most reliable regarding USB boot were the G5 Towers and G5 iMacs.\nKeep in mind that before you do all this you may want to ensure you have the latest firmware updates installed. While there haven't been any updates for a decade, it is still possible that a previous owner has not installed them all, and you can't do it without a Mac OS installation.\n\nFor reference, a link to a known working Linux CD ISO image (I have a PPC G4 1.2Ghz white iBook here as well, works with that CD): http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/ports/releases/9.04/release/ubuntu-9.04-alternate-powerpc.iso\nThis is the 'alternate' image, which should allow you to boot a bit faster on low-memory machines and has a few extra tools to allow you to wipe the disk (I'd suggest just writing zeroes to the whole thing, or if you are paranoid use /dev/urandom and write that to the /dev/hda or /dev/sda). When it boots, you can just ignore the installer and move directly to 'recovery shell' to get going.\n\nA: Use srm (secure removal of files/directories) to securely delete the User folder with your personal data.\nsrm has been in OS X since 2004 so it's included with Tiger.  This will allow you to securely delete your files without affecting the rest of the OS.  This has the added advantage of whomever you're donating to doesn't have to go through the trouble of finding install media to get the machine working again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your iBook\n\n*Create a new user with Admin priviliges\n\n*Log out and log back in as the user you just created\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Navigate to the the /Users folder\n\n*Issue the command srm -rf [Username]\n\n*Close Terminal\n\n*Go into System Preferences >> Users & Groups\n\n*Delete the old user\n\n\nThat's it...  Your personal data is gone and you don't have to go though any convoluted steps to boot Linux.\nAs for srm and the level of security, you can add the following flags:\n\n\n*\n\n*-s = simple; overwrite with a single pass of random data\n\n*-m = medium; overwrite with 7 DoD compliant passes\n\n*-z = zero; after overwriting, zero the blocks used by the file\n\n\nYou can get more info on srm from the man page (man srm)\n", "Q: How to track stationary bike activity with the Apple Health App on an iPhone SE? I'm not great about setting aside time to exercise, but I am definitely a data nerd and just discovered my iPhone SE has a built in ability to track steps (pedometer) and other things.  Cool!  I also like to get in some stationary bike time while watching TV, listening to a podcast, etc.  I do not have an Apple Watch.\nUnfortunately, it appears that the Health app can't actually track anything beyond steps and \"flights\" on its own.  It has no idea when I'm on the exercise bike, and in fact is crediting me with steps instead.  This seems very odd since years ago Apple publicly claimed that the Health app would automatically know the difference between walking, cycling, etc. and track accordingly.\nI found many people complaining about this in forums and the only \"solution\" I've read is to install a 3rd party app such as iBiker.  I did so, but have also found that that app can't track anything meaningful on its own either!  It will track duration of ride, but without additional sensors it has no way to track anything more detailed.  So basically it's pretty much as useful as a stop watch.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to track exercise bike and other activity aside from steps, with an iPhone SE without the addition of 3rd party hard/software?\n\n\n*\n\n*If yes, then how?\n\n*If no, what is the simplest/cheapest way to automatically track exercise bike activity?\n\n\n*Bonus question:  Is it possible to get the Health app to stop counting exercise bike activity as steps?\n\n*Bonus #2:  How often does the Health app actually update the data on its dashboard?  So far it seems fairly random/inconsistent.\n\n\nA: There is a chart I found on the American Exercise Council...step conversion table...minutes of lots of activities at various levels of effort convert to so many steps per minute...such as stationary bike...I bike for 40 min at a time..( 2 programs that automatically change resistance)...this converts to 19 steps a minute of s bike activity....I initially Googled something like Step/Bike Conversion)\nSo, if you like that sort of thing (manually calculating) there are ways to do that without the Apple Watch or third party apps.\n\nA: I would get either Strava app or CycleMeter (or RunMeter - they are the same except for the icon) if you don't want to get an Apple Watch and do want your information on your device. They all have the concept of \"indoor workout\" so that they can record a workout.\nThey work well with bluetooth sensors from Wahoo if you want cadence / speed / power measurements or estimations and your cycle doesn't have this capability to feed iOS (many are in development and even shipping). I use all three of the items above in combination. The Wahoo sensor feeds RunMeter which also reads heart rate from my Apple Watch and then feeds all the data into both health app and strava.\nIt's quite a setup and you could probably simplify things and just use iOS 11 and Apple Watch to get 90% of what I've assembled. With iOS 12, the workouts app is going to be even better on the watch and phone so you could do away with most of the gear I'm using and be very happy indeed with your cycle workouts measured.\n", "Q: How to disable animation on opening Notification Centre in macOS? I couldn't find it here. Perhaps you can't disable it but if you can I would love to know how. \nMy preference is for Notification Centre to open instantly.\n\nA: Absolutely, if you are after a snappier mac by saving those precious seconds here and there, I believe the best option is to go into the System Preferences and turning on Reduce Motion in the Accessibility tab.\nTurning on Reduced Motion\n\n\nThis makes the Notification Centre slide-in animation instant. I hope that helps you out, it really makes a difference. Definitely, let me know how you get on.\n", "Q: How do people find out hidden UserDefaults Quite often I come across these online posts about these hidden tricks that, usually entered it Terminal, access the user defaults system and overwrites/creates new defaults which are not normally changed by the system GUI.\nWhat I'm wondering is how do folks \"figure out\" these so-called \"hidden\" tricks?\n\n\n*\n\n*Did Apple document all the usable preferences for their software?\n\n*Did these people know people that work for apple and therefor built these tricks?\n\n*Are these people just nuts and spend all their day punching in random defaults looking to see if any of them do anything?\n\n\nA: \nDid Apple document all the usable preferences for their software?\n\nYes.  The first place to look is, well, Apple's Documentation Site.  Virtually everything that has to do with your Mac and the OS will be documented here.\nAdditionally, macOS is built upon a core BSD kernel so lots of the Terminal commands you see referenced to here actually come from that space.  One of the best places to learn about BSD is from the FreeBSD Handbook; arguably one of the most comprehensive documentation source for BSD.  Personally speaking, coming from that space (and I'm still a \"resident\") to macOS was very straight forward.\n\nDid these people know people that work for Apple and therefor built\n  these tricks?\n\nThey're not tricks; it's Apple's framework.  Everything from how the user interacts with the desktop to what happens when you save a file is based on a well documented framework. \n\nAre these people just nuts and spend all their day punching in random\n  defaults looking to see if any of them do anything?\n\nNuts?  A very emphatic NO.  However, I can say for certainty we are a curious bunch and always on a quest for knowledge.  I know I have spent lots of time in front of the screen just \"see what something does\" in the pursuit to expanding my knowledge base.\nThat said, finding these \"defaults\" is usually from necessity (i.e. we have an actual problem to solve).  A good deal of it is done via research as well as trial and error.\nI have VM (virtual machines) running on my iMac with different versions of macOS just to simply try things so I can experiment without the fear of catastrophically messing things up.\nIf this is something you wish to explore, I suggest you start by surfing through this site and find \"issues\" that pique your interest.  From there, try the solutions to see what happens for nothing more than the sake of expanding your skill set.\n", "Q: Linux Mint VM crashes when MacOS sleeps? I'm running Linux Mint on Virtual Box (.vdi on my internal SSD) on my rMBP (macOS High Sierra).\nWhile I haven't pinned down a pattern, I think it breaks every time my computer wakes up from sleep. So, I assume its something to do with putting the SSD to some sleep-state which breaks Mint.\nWhat setting can I enable/disable to keep this from happening?\n\nA: This is expected behavior.\nYour VM is not going to continue to run when your Mac goes to sleep.  In this case, your VirtualBox will attempt to save the state of the machine.  I have found FreeBSD to be forgiving in these cases, but Linux (Ubuntu) has never liked it when the Mac went to sleep and VB attempted to save the state.\nThe most effective solution is to disable sleep when your VM is running.\n", "Q: Streaming media from Mac to VLC for Android I have few media files in my Mac which I want to stream on my Android phone. I have enabled File Sharing and enabled both smb and afp protocol. When I check in VLC for Android app, I can see my Mac's name there. However when I try to connect it, it shows me a login prompt asking me to enter username and password.   \nI tried my Mac's only username and password, but it didn't do anything. The username have spaces in it, so I tried some combinations (such as all lowercase, no spaces etc.), to no avail.\nFor eg. If my username on my mac is Abc Xyz, I tried Abc Xyz, Abc%20Xyz, abcxyz, AbcXyz etc. But it showed me empty directories.  \nSo is there any way I can make that login prompt work? I even tried with giving Everyone access to the shared folders, but it still didn't work. By not working, I mean, the VLC displayed error The directory is empty or a login prompt again.  \nPS: I am on macOS Sierra (10.12.6) and the user have admin access.\n\nA: You can just enable guests to access shared folders. Go to Users and Groups and give access to Guests to Shared folders/Sharing.\n\nA: TL;DR\nOn most *nix systems Android included to login with a a user name which has a space you'd escape the space with a \\, ie. John\\ Doe The \\ will allow the OS / shell to know that a special character, ie. a space ␣ or another special character will be next, thus the escaping with a \\.\n\nSo I was curious about how this could be done this afternoon as well, so I spent about an hour to get things setup, and I now have a working solution.\nFirst off, my situation is a little different from yours, but essential the same.  Instead of having an Android phone, the wifey  has an Amazon Fire TV Stick.  I have some vidoes on my MBP that I'd like to watch on our TV with the Fire Stick.  The Fire Stick uses Android OS as well, and also supports VLC with no side loading BS .\nI proceed to download and install VLC on the fire stick, and it appears to run fine.   There is a pretty accessible menu for accessing local network shares.\nNow, comes the fun part of setting up the Network Share, ie. my MBP MacBook Pro.\n\nI have all my local videos files stored in $HOME/Movies on my macOS box, so I could make that folder accessible by setting it up as a share using SMB or AFP which is \"kind of\" what I did but not really.\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a regular user on the system and give it read access to your $HOME/Movies directory.\n\n\nExpanded procedure\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user on macOS, I chose the username media.\na. From Apple Menu select System Preferences...\nb. From the System Preferences dialog select Users & Groups\nc. Click the ➕ within Users & Groups, and create a Standard User.\n\nCreate a new user.\n\n\n\n\n*Create a new group within the same Users & Groups dialog, I chose to name the newly created group media as well.\n\n\n\nCreate a new group\n\n\n\n\n*Add the user which the video's belongs to, ie. in my case that would be capin.  And also add the media user to the newly created group as well.\n\n\n\nAdding Users to a Group\n\n\n\n\n*Next turn on File Sharing from System Preferences within the Sharing button.\n\n\n\nEnabling File Sharing\n\n\n\n\n*Set the Shared Folders and Users within Sharing System Preferences with the users and permissions you want for your shared folder, and remove any unused shares if so desired.\n\n\n\nSetting Permissions for the Share\n\n\n\n\n*SMB settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple of notes, I was unable to get AFP to work properly, but I did have luck  getting SMB working.  And, another thing you'll have to input the username & password for the media account you setup.\n\nIMHO I can't help but think creating a separate user to access media shares is a much better solution that using your daily driver  account for obvious security reasons.\ncheers \nChris\n", "Q: How to delete infinitely recurring directories I have a strange issue with deleting items from the Trash. It appears that there are infinite nested directories which I cannot seem to remove. If I try to \"empty\" the trash I get an error which reads \"The operation can’t be completed because the item is in use.\". I tried using Terminal to cd into .Trash and the files are not listed, but I tried rm -rf * anyway, but to no avail...\n\nThe nested directories go on forever apparently (it shows 1-36 there in the image, but if I use the arrow to expand the last one then another, and another, and another shows up)... Does anyone have a clue how I can remove these from the Trash? Thanks.\nEDIT: After waiting some time I now also get another error \"You can’t open the Trash because it’s being emptied.\". Oddball behavior here.\n\nA: It is certainly interesting to see an infinite folder structure in the trash so naturally, the typical deletion process would take infinite time. Something went horribly wrong somewhere.\nWhat can you try?\nClose all programs (reboot if necessary to interrupt the current deletion process) and try Running First Aid on your boot volume. Be sure to disconnect any attached drives such as TimeMachine backups or network shares to eliminate them from the equation. \nYou mentioned having tried the sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash command to no avail, but how about sudo rm -rf /Volumes/*/.Trashes? The full article is here in case you are looking for a little background information. Your macOS system will rebuild the .Trashes folder next time it needs it.\nAs far as the \"You can’t open the Trash because it’s being emptied.\" message is concerned, this is usually fixed through a Finder restart or better yet, system restart.\nLet me know if that makes sense and how it works out for you.\n\nA: I was able to fix this by moving the top level of the recursive folder to the desktop (anywhere outside of the trash, really), then select the top level folder, then press option-command-delete to re-delete it without putting it back in the trash.\n\nA: There is an app you can find called Trash It and that usually sorts this type of thing out:\n\nWhat is Trash It?\nThis little Applescript-based App force-empties your Apple trash can, ridding it of files and folders that refuse to be deleted. It also supports Drag and Drop. If you have stuck files or folders in the Trash with permissions set incorrectly, locked items, want to delete a stubborn file(s) or folder(s) on your desktop or elsewhere, or delete items from other partitions, give Trash It! a try.\n\nI am not involved in any way with \"Trash It\" : standard disclaimer apart from having used it!\n\nA: I ran into this problem the other day and also couldn't get any third party apps or terminal to trash the trash. \nMy solution is\n\n\n*\n\n*Move folder from trash to desktop\n\n*Open terminal \n\n*Type following command rm -rf ~/Desktop/folder-name/ \n\n*Enter and this will remove the folder. \n\n\nIs this the answer to why it happened, no it is not. But hopefully it will help the next person who runs into this issue without using any third party apps. \n\nA: I ran into this problem a couple of times and I tried lots of different 'fixes' but nothig worked until I did these following steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Trash\n\n*Open one of the nested folders \n\n*Open another nested folder inside the previously opened one\n\n*Move the current nested folder into the first folder\n\n*Empty Trash\n\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra internet recovery is frozen I am using MacBook Pro 15 2015. I erased the drive and now I cannot complete the Internet recovery. It is stuck saying \nmacOS High Sierra will be installed on the disk \"Untitled\"\n \"About 17 hours 7 minutes remaining\"\n\nfor the past 10 hours. I did use Internet recovery in the past many times(with disk erase as well) and it was done usually in the matter of hours. This time for some reason it does not progress.\nInternet connection cannot be an issue, Wi-Fi bar is complete and other devices can stream 4k easily (what was just for testing - nothing else was using bandwidth most of the time).\nI tried to repeat the Internet recovery and it always eventually get stuck at some time \"16 hours 4 minutes\" or sometimes even just \"8 minutes\".\nIt does not become frozen, i still can click the option to cancel it (or change input language) - - just stuck with update.\nI highly doubt there is a hardware failure, because it was working absolutely fine just before the disk erase and there were never any issues with it in the meantime.\nGetting to apple store is very hard in my city (there are no apple stores). Is there anything else I could do to try to make it install?\n\nA: This is why it is better to first download macOS from the Apps Store to your Applications folder. You then can create a USB flash drive installer for offline installations. The instructions are given at this Apple website: How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\nYou have already erased your drive so this is no longer an option on your Mac. In your case, you would now need another Mac to download High Sierra and make the installer.\n\nFYI: I usually have two installations of macOS per Mac. Each installation is in separate partitions. I usually the edit the /etc/fstab file so each installation can not access the other installation, unless I do a mount. This way I usually can avoid having to use macOS Recovery.\n\n", "Q: AppleScript UI Scripting and click I would like to click and have automatic action with a software, \nI can refer to it and get the value of the text but can't manage to click \ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"app\"\n\n    click static text \"General Info\" of UI element 1 of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of front window\n\nend tell\n\nThis return missing value \nand if I do   select static text \"General Info\" of UI element 1 of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of front window then I have a return (but no click obviously) \nwhat can I do to click in this area ?\nI have a similar issue with a dropdown menu with I have to select and set a value \nset value of pop up button 1 of group 3 of group 2 of scroll area 1 of group 3 of front window to \"Open\"\n\nI can't manage to select a value (for example the second value inside the menu)\n\nA: You can try using Automator “Watch Me Do” and record your actions in that business application. When you are done recording your actions, you can select all of those recorded actions and copy them to your clipboard. You can then paste into a script editor document. From there you will be able to see the commands and UI elements then just backward engineer them to suit your needs\nFor example in this following image, the commented code was what I pasted into script editor from the copied commands of “Watch me do” in Automator.

The phone runs noticeably sluggishly, and it is not uncommon for apps to crash when attempting processor-intensive tasks.\nHow can I find out which app or process is consuming so much memory?  I wonder if there is one or more rogue processes which are out of control and should be killed?  Something akin to macOS Activity Monitor is what I'm looking for.\nIn an attempt to improve performance, I've tried all of the suggestions listed here, except a full backup and restore.  I am beginning to wonder whether an Apple iPhone 6 battery replacement may be beneficial, but before I do so, I would like to do some diagnosis to find out what the performance hog is.\n\nA: One thing missing from your question is the age of your iPhone 6 or, more specifically, the age of your battery. My guess is that a battery replacement is in order as the symptoms just fit.\nAlso, the high memory utilisation is not likely to explain the symptoms your iPhone is currently having. An ageing battery, on the other hand (and ageing could refer to its cycle count instead of its age in time), is certainly one possible explanation for your symptoms. \niPhone batteries are typically rated at having a maximum battery life of 500 cycles. However, this refers to the life of the battery and not to when you'll start noticing issues. In my experience, batteries can start showing signs of wear as early as when they reach about 65% of their cycle count and they start showing more serious signs at around 80% of their cycle count, so that's one figure you may want to investigate if you're still trying to make a decision.\nIt's not clear which version of the Lirum app you're using, but if you're only using the Lite version or aren't getting an indication of how many cycles your battery has had, you may want to consider coconutBattery (assuming you also have a Mac). \ncoconutBattery is an awesome app that you can install on your Mac (if you have one). You can then connect your iPhone to your Mac and this app will show you the battery's current charge, its full charge capacity, and its design capacity, its cycle count, and so on. \nIf you have a MacBook of some sort it'll give you a whole heap of info relating to your MacBook battery too.\n", "Q: Apple Mail stuck on \"Preparing to Move Messages\"? In the last two weeks, Apple Mail is starting to get \"stuck\" with increasing frequency, showing a \"Preparing to move messages: 1 of XXX\" message in the lower left corner. Apple Mail still allows me to read messages, but attempts to delete or move messages fail as described below.\nThis typically occurs when I'm in the process of deleting messages from my inbox; Apple Mail cheerfully removes the message from the window, but rather than moving the messages upstream using IMAP, the transfer simply bumps the count of messages that are being \"prepared.\" So, for instance, my Mail is currently stuck, showing \"Preparing to move messages: 1 of 22\". If I delete a message, that goes up to \"1 of 23.\" \nTurning network off and on appears to make no difference.\nQuitting and restarting Mail \"solves\" the problem in the sense that it's no longer wedged, but all of the pending transfers are aborted, and my inbox suddenly again contains dozens or hundreds of messages that I already \"deleted.\" Deleting then appears to work correctly... for an hour or two.\nRelevant facts about my mail setup:\n1) OS X 10.13.3\n2) I'm using IMAP...\n3) ... to communicate with a machine running Dovecot.\n4) \"Connection Doctor\" within Mail indicates no problems with the network connections, and I can refresh the status at will.\nMany thanks in advance for any advice!\n\nA: I deleted my imap account on my powerbook and then added it again. Apple Mail then downloaded about 4000 msgs and everything is back to normal.\n\nA: Not entirely sure if this qualifies as an answer, but it might be helpful for others with this problem: about a week after this behavior began, I happened to reboot my mail server, and the problem is no longer occurring. It would appear to me that the restart of dovecot solved the problem. Hope this helps others with the problem....\n", "Q: Can't prevent Preview from permitting copying content with Adobe Acrobat document security I create educational products and sell at an online marketplace.  I buy clipart and use this.\nI create using Pages on my Mac, I then press Print, PDF, open in Preview, grab the thumbnail and combine each page to form a document.  On completion, I export the document to PDF.\nI am currently trialling Adobe Acrobat Pro and have followed the steps to secure the document. I have included a screenshot of security options I have set.  I do save the settings and the PDF says by the file name SECURE. I then zip this with another secure file as I need to create my products in US letter and A4 so I zip together and then I upload to the website.\nHowever when I have downloaded I can still lift the clipart.  I have tried this on 3 different Macs and it still can be lifted.  Does Adobe not work with Pages, does zipping affect the security issues or is it that I open on macs and they can override the security settings?\nI have read somewhere that the Preview application overrides adobe security settings.  I have not bought Adobe is there another PDF application for Macs that includes security settings I must lock the clipart or I am liable for copyright.\n \n\nA: Preview on macOS, like many PDF readers, don't care about these kinds of obscure restrictions on what you can and can't do with PDFs. If you're displaying content to the user, they can copy it, it's as simple as that.\nPassword protecting the entire file encrypts its contents, and password protecting printing can be followed by PDF readers including Preview, but apart from that all the other restriction types are worthless outside of Adobe Reader.\n", "Q: Delete all files of a resolution Apple Photos I have recently, imported various photos from both iCloud Shared Album downloads and directly from my iPhone. The problem is that some of these photos are duplicates, however the iCloud Shared Album duplicates are exactly half the resolution.\nDuplicate scanners I have tried fail detecting these duplicates because of their different resolution. Additionally, I want to make sure I delete the low-res versions.\nIs it possible to batch-delete photos by resolution in Photos.app?\n\nA: You can identify low-resolution photos in Photos.app using AppleScript and collate them into a single album that would then allow you to select them all in one go for deletion.\nOrdinarily, this code snippet (run from inside Script Editor) would find the low-resolution photos (and videos) and put them into a new album called \"Low Res\":\n    tell application \"Photos\" to add ¬\n        (every media item whose ¬\n            (height > width and height ≤ 480) or ¬\n            (width > height and width ≤ 480)) to ¬\n        make new album named \"Low Res\"\n\nHowever, on MacOS 10.13 with the latest updates installed, it throws an error, reporting that it can't retrieve the specified album.  This is probably a bug in Photos.app.\nSo, I decided to assign a description to all of these media items instead:\n    tell application \"Photos\" to ¬\n        set the description of ¬\n            (every media item whose ¬\n                (height > width and height ≤ 480) or ¬\n                (width > height and width ≤ 480)) to ¬\n            \"Low Resolution\"\n\n    display alert \"Done.\"\n\nThen, within Photos.app, I created a Smart Album with the following search criterion:\n\nAfter clicking OK, the album was populated by the photos (and videos) that were marked as being of low-resolution.\nNow, assuming there's nothing in there you'd like to keep, you would simply press Cmd+A to select all of the items, then Cmd+⌫ to delete them all from the library (it actually moves them to the library's Recently Deleted folder, meaning you can retrieve any items you didn't intend to delete).\nA couple of notes:\nIf you don't want video files to be included in the cull, then use these criteria for the smart album instead:\n\nNote the match selection is set to all.  This excludes videos and gives you an album populated only by photos of low resolution.\nFinally, bear in mind that the AppleScript has to search through your entire library and compare the height and width of every item it comes across.  Depending on your library size, it can take a few minutes.\nMy Photos.app library has 8000 photos in it and it took about three minutes to on a MacBook 1.2GHz m5 to complete.\nIf Script Editor times out, wrap the code inside a timeout block and specify a length of time in seconds to allow the code to run to completion:\n    with timeout of 300 seconds\n        tell application \"Photos\" to...\n        ...etc...\n    end timeout\n\n    display alert \"Done.\"\n\n", "Q: What is the default \"cursive\" font for macOS? I am working on a Processing project for fun and I wanted to use the cursive font that is usually called in HTML and everything else, \"cursive\" or \"Cursive,\" but in Processing it does the default sans-serif (Arial I think).

Why? Why doesn't it work anymore in normal boot mode but still in recovery?\nAny insight on the above is appreciated. But the single question I like to have an answer to is: how can I set this NVRAM variable in either normal boot mode or at least in SingleUser boot mode?\n\nA: See this answer from @tubedogg.  \nIt would appear that the change from 10.10 to 10.12 is another step toward including all important security aspects within System Integrity Protection (SIP), meaning that you can't change these things without first explicitly setting privileges. SIP applies to all users on a Mac, including admins and root.\nI've just confirmed (because I'm reconfiguring a MacBook Pro with Sierra 10.12.6 just now) that:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Setting boot-args=\"-v\" in recovery mode will retain the setting in a normal boot mode.\n\n*Disabling SIP using csrutil disable in recovery mode will allow you to set boot-args in a normal boot session. WARNING: You should not disable SIP unless you really need to - and you should already know how and why!\nAgain according to @tubedogg, you can also leave SIP enabled, but allow nvram changes from your normal boot session. This might be more appropriate for your needs. In the Terminal in recovery mode type csrutil enable --without nvram and then restart. I haven't tried this option personally, as it's not something I need right now.\nI also haven't tried your agc=0 switch. It's not something I've come across, and it wasn't in a list of boot arguments I consulted, although I did manage to find a reference that appears to resolve a very specific GPU hardware problem.

At school, they DO NOT let you download any games.\nSo far, I have tried TweakBox, Tutu App and APKpure without any success.\nIs there a way to download games onto the iPad?\n\nA: Introduction\nAs @SteveChambers rightfully points out, devices are managed by the network administrator partly to prevent what you are trying to do but also because the school is probably liable for any harm etc. caused by \"incorrect/inappropriate usage\" of their devices.\nThe short answer is no, yet depending on the games you are talking about, it is actually quite possible to talk to your network administrator or somebody that does the I.T. work and tell them why you think it is beneficial to have the app installed. If you are lucky (and have compelling reasons), your idea is then discussed with the rest of the senior leadership team.\nHaving worked as a Network Admin in a school (though only 8th grade and up) for a few years, I have seen what happens if even the smallest devices aren't locked down to the max. I thought I'd share with you a little background information because when you realise the vast amount of nasty stuff that gets filtered out, you truly learn to appreciate that it is one thing you (the user) does not need to worry about - allowing you to focus on what's important, your education.\nWhy prevent app installations?\nUsually, iPads are safe in terms of infections and malicious content but with the introduction of Bring Your Own Device(s) (BYOD) in many schools, it becomes increasingly challenging to keep the nasty stuff out - on a global level.  \nExample:\nWhile the school may do its best to keep you save on their network, the moment you leave to connect at home (or another network for that matter) the filter/protection is no longer there, opening students up to all the nasty stuff (with or without the student knowing).\nThe next school day, those infections (now having bypassed the school's filter because they came through the home network) are inside the school network where the potential for spreading to more devices becomes much greater and very difficult to combat.\nHow does it relate to you?\nNow you are probably asking yourself what this has to do with not being allowed to install apps? Well, apps (especially those for educational purposes) go through rigorous testing and trailing by schools and independent organizations before they are \"approved\" as appropriate and meaningful to education. Perhaps it allows independent work to be made simpler, students to learn in teams etc...\nYou did mention having checked out some sites/AppStore alternatives whose content probably didn't pass those tests and (looking at it from a security point of view) are not the safest at all. They most likely get you banned from using the iPads for the rest of the year (due to breaching your Device/Cyber agreement that you and your parents probably had to sign at some point.  \nThe core problem is that when a student has the device, the teacher does not see the screen, meaning that there is no way of checking if work is actually being done or not. Hence, when the iPad was first set up, a set of standards where followed - similar to rules - which dictate how the school goes about keeping their devices/network and people safe and focused.\nConclusion\nAs you move through the grades, you learn to become a safer, independent, digital citizen who is able to better weigh the negatives against the positives and get a little more flexibility in the filtering. But just like the driver of the car has the final say on the type of music, your school has the final say on what's allowed.\nHopefully, that made for an interesting read, let me know if it made sense or if there is something you don't understand. Good luck with your quest in getting the game approved and all the best with your studies.\n", "Q: Does the Apple Remote (Aluminium) with IR still have a use? I'm wondering if I can still use the old Apple Remote (Aluminium) with IR to control some Apple devices?\nI have the Retina MacBook (without IR)(how?), an iPhone and an Apple TV. Perhaps it can also pair with other (non-Apple) products.\n\nA: Background\nThe Retina MacBook Pro does not have an IR sensor, just like the missing battery indicator. Apple really pushed hard to feature more Bluetooth heavy peripherals from that point. Looking back it seems like the right step forward. The Siri remote (just as an example) is able to transmit more complex data than the older, yet well-built aluminum IR remote ever could. The IR sensor has become obsolete because of features such as AirPlay and other mechanisms that put increasingly growing control into one place (the iOS device).\nWhat can you try? \n\n\n*\n\n*You may be able to pair the Apple Remote with your Apple TV if you\nhappen to have one that was released around the same time. This\ntutorial should demonstrate how the Aluminum remote can be paired\nwith an Apple TV (2nd generation).   I have to be honest\nin that I don't personally own an Apple TV or the remote for that\nmatter, yet at work, we have seamlessly paired various different\nremotes (from different 2nd or 3rd generation\nApple TVs).\n\n*You will however not be able to pair the remote with the iPhone because much like the Mac, the iPhone does not have an IR sensor.\n\n*I fail to come up with everyday things that have an IR sensor capable of receiving signals from the Apple Remote but are non-Apple products. Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think that there are any devices worth controlling, let alone capable of receiving the signal. Yep, that's Apple for you.\n\n\nLet me know if that was helpful in any way or if you come up with other ideas/products. \n\nA: There are a number of third-party IR receivers that can plug into a modern Apple product via USB and (supposedly) will allow you to use your old-style infrared Apple Remote with a newer computer.  For example, this website purports to sell IR receivers with either USB-A or USB-C connectivity.  A similar product is sold on Amazon here.  Finally, this YouTube video tells you how to make your own version.  (Disclaimer: I have not tested any of these products or methods and can't confirm whether they actually work.)\n", "Q: Message: This Apple ID has not yet been used with the app store I've set up billing information and address but still the laptop I am trying to use says \"This Apple ID has not yet been used with the app store.\"\nI am entering in my information correctly.

How can I free up more space in my iCloud Drive?\n\nA: Solar Mike's guess was correct. I had deleted stuff that was in my iCloud Drive and those \"deleted\" stuff was still taking up space.\nWhen you delete something on your Mac, it goes to ~/.Trash. However, when you delete something that was on iCloud Drive, that doesn't go to ~/.Trash.

I have multiple apps which I get notifications from but they are all in Hebrew. I was wondering if there is a way to let the notification go through a process in which something like Google Translate translates the push notifications and then I receive them. Is that possible?\n\nA: No, that is not possible on the iPhone as a user.\nHowever, the developer of the app can add automatic translation as a feature. This would require the messages to be translated in their backend before being sent as push notifications to your phone.\n\nA: If you’re able to tap on notification and select text in the app, you can use the app named Workflow. Just create a workflow for Actions Extension to translate the selected text and post it to Notes. Works for me. \n", "Q: Is there a menu bar tool which will let me eject external drives easily? I usually have a lot of external drives connected to my MacBook, such as flash drives, hard drives, and SD cards. It so happens that I need to eject them quite often.\nThe usual way I eject these is by either showing the desktop using a shortcut and dragging the drives I want to eject to the trash, or navigating to the finder and ejecting the drives from there, or by using a script which ejects all my external drives at once. However, when I want to do something simple like ejecting a flash drive or SD card (which I do quite often) I'd prefer not to break my workflow and simply be able to, say, click on a menu bar icon and select which volume I want to eject.\nI haven't yet seen a utility which can achieve this. Does anyone know of one?\n\nA: macOS included a built in menu bar item to eject removable drives. LifeWire has done a much better job than I could do providing instructions on how to add this to your Mac's menu bar. \nCheck it out here: Add a Menu Bar Item to Eject a CD or DVD\nUpdate: This answer is incorrect. While macOS includes an eject menu, it can only eject optical discs.\n\nA: Try Mountain. http://appgineers.de/mountain/\nNot only does it allow you to mount and eject drives, you can select to not mount a drive on restart. I unmount a drive after cloning and don't want it mounted again on restart. This app does exactly what I want.\n\nA: The Finder eject shortcut is Cmd+e, e for eject, easy!\nThis also works on the desktop. Click/select the drive, mash Cmd+e, give it a couple seconds to disappear, done!\nNote that this also works if you have a Finder window open to any folder on an external drive, Cmd+e and it will eject that drive.\nIf it’s a multi-partition drive, add Shift to eject the whole disk device rather than just the single partition.\n\nA: As Semulov is in maintainable mode, there is a paid alternative that works good for me: Jettison\n\nA: Try Semulov - it is designed to eject volumes from the menu bar. The author has even made the source available on GitHub.\n\nA: Elgato makes a dock eject utility for their Thunderbolt dock, which really only makes sense in context to disks.

I do a lot of shadow puppetry, and the iPhone's LED makes very crisp shadows, while in other LED torches the shadows blur.\nCurious if anyone has any leads, or if anyone knows about the specific kind of LED that is used in the iPhone's flash.\n\nA: Your request sounds unconventional. The iPhone flash is a specific part of the gadget that's hard to fake. But let me ask, for what purpose are you looking for this particular flash? I think it's much better to find a flashlight with multiple modes, like a flash, diffused light, and a well-directed direct white beam. Well, I can just show you my favorite flashlight. I always take mine https://www.amazon.com/Vont-Flashlight-Flashlights-Water-Resistant-Accessories/dp/B089T8HDBV when I go camping outdoors. Also, I use it when I need to photograph someone in the dark. Of course, I don't like the red-eye effect like in all digital photos.

I have got a MacBook pro with 500GB of total storage and an iCloud subscription for 2TB.\niCloud is synched with my MacBook, this means that any file in my desktop and documents will be stored automatically in iCloud.\nWith time, however, the MacBook storage is getting full and now I have got only ~2GB left (in the Mac) but >1.70TB available on iCloud.\nHow should I deal with this?\nI desire to keep iCloud on all my Mac devices...MacBook Pro included but how can I avoid to save files in both MacBook storage AND iCloud? I would like to save them only on iCloud.\nI still cannot get around this.\nAny suggestion?\nThanks\n\nA: As long as you're running High Sierra, you can have your Mac take care of this automatically. Go into the iCloud Drive system preferences and check the box for \"Optimize Mac Storage\". Your Mac will then remove local copies of old files when more storage space is needed, while keeping them on iCloud Drive.\n\nA: You need to free up space on your MacBook Pro.\niCloud is not additional space that you can use to supplement your hard drive.  It's space in the cloud for you to store/synchronize files.  It's more akin to a USB drive that you connect to your Mac - just because you connect it doesn't mean your internal hard drive instantaneously grow in capacity.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete unwanted files from \n\n*get a larger hard drive\n\n\n\nI desire to keep iCloud on all my Mac devices...MacBook Pro included\n  but how can I avoid to save files in both MacBook storage AND iCloud?\n  I would like to save them only on iCloud.\n\nUnfortunately, iCloud (Documents) is a sync all/nothing proposition.

I know Time Machine is a great backup system on Mac, but I don't like it when it starts backing up everything on a mac.My work is completely done on emails and these emails now need to be backed up as the mailbox is filling up quickly. I am using Apple Mail as well as Outlook 2016 for Mac, both with different email ids. I need to backup both of them so that I don't lose any emails and also if I need to access those emails in future I can do that easily. Here Time machine is a great app to backup but I don't want to backup other stuff, I just need it to backup my email database. Is that possible, if yes then how can I do that and if no then what are other possible options I have as an email backup system?\n\nA: The basics\nFirst of all, I would highly suggest backing up your entire Mac with Time Machine. (It'll include all your emails that aren't on the server.) After the first backup it only saves what changed, so if you don't change anything outside of mail, it won't have to spend time re-backing it all up.\nThat said, you can back up just emails. I don't know how to do this with Time Machine (although it's probably possible), but it's relatively easy to do with a tool called rsync. Your emails are stored here (assuming you're using the built-in Mail.app):\n~/Library/Mail\nTo back them up, you can just copy (not move!) this folder to an external drive. Unlike a Finder copy (as far as I know), rsync is smart enough to only copy the changes next time you back it up. To do one backup, run this command in the Terminal:\nrsync -rlptgDEHP ~/Library/Mail /Volumes/\"Some External Drive\"/\"Mail Backups\"\n\nThis will copy the folder to a folder called \"Mail Backups\" on your external drive. (The quotes are required if you have spaces in the folder/drive name.)\n\nAutomating this with launchd\nThere's a program called launchd that, in addition to running basically the entire system (it's the Mac equivalent of init), can run other programs at specified times. To tell it what to run when, you use a plist file (short for \"property list\").\nSo how do you do this? You'll need to put this into a plain-text file somewhere, like ~/bin/backup-emails:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\n# lines starting with '#' are a comment and have no effect\n# (except for the #! line above); you can leave them out\n\n# this is the rsync command from the section above\nrsync -rlptgDEHP ~/Library/Mail /Volumes/\"Some External Drive\"/\"Mail Backups\"\n\nThen open a terminal, type chmod +x and a space, and drag in the file you just created. Hit Enter. This will make the file \"executable\" -- the system will be able to run it as a program.\nYou can run the file you just made instead of typing the rsync command when you want to back up manually.\nNext, fire up TextEdit (or another plain-text editor of your choice) and paste in the following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.yourname.backup-emails</string>\n\n        <key>Program</key>\n        <string>/bin/zsh</string>\n\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>-f</string>\n            <string>-c</string>\n            <!-- wherever you put the script you made before -->\n            <string>~/bin/backup-emails</string>\n        </array>\n\n        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n        <array>\n            <dict>\n                <!-- run every week at 7am -->\n                <key>Hour</key>\n                <integer>7</integer>\n                <key>Weekday</key>\n                <integer>0</integer>\n            </dict>\n        </array>\n\n        <!-- replace your username appropriately -->\n        <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n        <string>/Users/username/tmp/backup-emails-stdout.log</string>\n        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n        <string>/Users/username/tmp/backup-emails-stderr.log</string>\n\n        <key>Debug</key>\n        <true />\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\nEverything between <!-- and --> is a comment and can be left out. (This includes the comment markers themselves, of course.) Replace yourname with your name (if you want to), and username with your username (the name of your home folder; this is required).\n(You can run man launchd.plist in a terminal to learn more about what you can do with these plist files.)\nSave this file as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.backup-emails.plist (replacing the com.yourname.backup-emails with whatever you used in the Label key above).\nThis step isn't strictly required, but it'll load it without having to log out and back in:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.backup-emails.plist\n\n\nUninstalling the launch agent\nSimply trash the ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.backup-emails file you made before. (To get to it, press ⇧⌘G in Finder and type/paste in ~/Library/LaunchAgents.)\n\nA: You can work out with Time Machine to exclude all the other folders except your Apple Mail Database Folder and Your Outlook 2016 mac database folders. As you haven't mentioned which version of Apple Mail you are using so here is how you can find your Mail Database Folder:\nFind and Open the Folder Where OS X Mail Stores Mail\nTo go to the folder that holds your OS X Mail messages:\nOpen a new window in OS X Finder.\nSelect Go | Go to Folder… from the menu.\nYou can also press Command-Shift-G.\nType \"~/Library/Mail/V3\".\nPress Enter.\nYou can find your folders and messages in sub-folders to the V3 folder:\nLocal mailboxes are in the Mailboxes sub-folder.\nPOP email accounts can be found in sub-folders with POP- in their name.\nIMAP accounts' mailboxes are in sub-folder that have IMAP- in their name.\nThe messages are stored in .mbox folders, one per OS X Mail email folder. Open and explore these folders to discover (and open or copy) the emails saved as .emlx files.\nFind and Open the Folder Where Mac OS X Mail 5–8 Store Mail\nTo open the folder where Mac OS X Mail keeps your messages:\nOpen a Finder window.\nSelect Go | Go to Folder… from the menu.\nType \"~/Library/Mail/V2\".\nYou can have Finder auto-complete the folder names by pressing Tab.\nClick OK.\nMac OS X Mail stores the mailboxes in sub-folders to the Mail directory, one sub-folder per account. POP accounts start with POP-, IMAP accounts with IMAP-.\nFind and Open the Folder Where Mac OS X Mail 1-4 Store Mail\nTo locate the folder where Mac OS X Mail 1-4 stores mail:\nOpen a new Finder window.\nGo to your home directory.\nYou can use the Home toolbar button or\nselect Go | Home from the menu to go home.\nOpen the Library/Mail directory.\nAlso there are multiple application available online for mac database backup as mentioned by Eric in the above post. There is one that is specifically for emails only and backs up all the email clients on Mac. Have a look: http://www.mailbackupx.com/how-to-scenerios/how-to-backup-apple-mac-mail-mails-o n-mac.html\n\nA: Emails should be saved via your email client (iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, Outlook/Hotmail/MSN, etc).\nIf you have one of those, they are web & cloud based email clients. Nearly all activities are saved automatically. If your email isnt similar to those then yes you'll want to save them via time Machine. \nAs seaturtle stated, you'll want to backup your entire Mac. Especially since emails are saved in the Macs Mail app inbox. \n\nA: If I understand you correctly :\n\n\n*\n\n*Your mailbox is filling up quickly\n\n*As a result you need to delete mails\n\n*But you also want to keep the option to access those mails easily in the future\n\n*Therefore you want to backup those mails, and then, delete them to save up space in the mailbox\n\n*When you, for some reason, need to access those mails in the future, you will search them in your backup\n\n\nAre you aware that you can make offline mail archives within the mail application, and move your old mails there? The mails will be transferred from your online mailserver to your local hard drive, cleaning up your online mailbox. But the mails will still be available in the mail application on your computer. Easily accessible and searchable like any other mailfolder.\nThat would in my opinion be a good approach if the free space on your harddrive is much higher than the free space in your mailbox.\nThis does not negate the need to make backups of your mails, for emergency purposes, but accessibility of these old mails will be much higher in my opinion.\n", "Q: How to manage company Macs? What is the \"Apple\" way of managing Macs in company environment? I've red about macOS server and Apple Remote Desktop which seems to share some management features.

Is there any option to have company controlled apple ids? We don't want private apple id's flying around ;)\n\nA: macOS Server and Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) are just two of the tools used to administer Apple computers in or organization.\nYou could use macOS Server to sync up with Active Directory, but in my experience, you can simply join each machine directly to your AD server without the intermediary (in other words....it's not required)\nAs for ARD....YYMV, but personally, I would rather use custom scripts to push out applications and updates\nApple has an excellent service called Apple Deployment Programs which helps you manage everything from AppleIDs to macOS and iOS deployments.  Contact your Apple business rep to help you set up this and your AppleIDs specific to your organization.\n\nA: Just to add to the other answers I would also be looking at an MDM or EMM, if you have lots of Macs.  \nSome examples are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jamf - Usually seen as ones of the best\n\n*Meraki - Free for up to 100 devices - not as full featured for Mac, better for iOS\n\n*Apple Profile Manager - This comes with macOS Server, I'm not sure about the newer versions but in my experience is less featured then the other MDMs\n\n*There is many more - need to research cost vs features\n\n\nApple seems to have been really pushing MDM's.  Some major benefits are Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP) and Apple's Volume Purchase Program (VPP).  These two help tons with setting up devices and pushing apps.  Also if you plan on imaging Macs, with APFS it makes it quite difficult.  I talked to an Apple Systems Engineer recently about it and it can still work on High Sierra but he speculates that it may not on future releases of macOS, so having an MDM to manager Apps and scripts is a step in the right direction.\nYou also get the benefits of pushing profiles to the devices where you can control lots of settings on the Macs, such as Wifi connections, restrictions, etc.  Each MDM has a different feature set.\n\nA: Just about the Apple ID :\nEach employee can make a unique id separate to their personal one AND without fixing it to a credit card : if you do the process on a mac when you get to the card bit there is the option “none” which is not visible on an ipad - how do I know - did exactly this last Tuesday...\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable key repeat for letter keys on the Apple Smart Keyboard for iPad Pro?

Is it possible to change this behavior to allow all keys to repeat like on a regular desktop keyboard? \n\nA: As far as I can tell this isn't possible, which is a shame. I was trying to use my iPad with remote desktop where I need to hold down keys and it just doesn't work. It seems this is a \"feature\" of iOS that only certain keys like space and delete are allowed to repeat.

Any idea on how to fix this or go around this?\n\nA: When opening an application with the open command, you should use the -a option, e.g:\nopen -a \"Safari\"\n\nFrom the man page for the open command:\n\n-a application\n       Specifies the application to use for opening the file\n\nNote: If you use the -a option, you typically do not need to specify the pathname or even use the .app extension. Just the format as in the example shown above should work.\n\n\nIn Terminal, the executable permission (and others) output of:\nls -l /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\n\nShould be:\n-rwxr-xr-x\n\nIf not, then in Terminal, run the following command:\nsudo chmod 0755 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\n\nThis will ensure the proper permissions on the Safari executable and should stop you from getting the error you've got.\n", "Q: Default audio to AirPods from iPhone Audio from my iPhone used to automatically go to my AirPods when I put them in my ear.

I have an iPhone 6 and would like to know if I could factory reset my phone and still be able to use all my data, minutes, and texts as soon as I set the phone up again?\n\nA: Typically a reset does not affect your contract, because the iPhone's state is independent of the SIM contract. Although it is best to verify that with your SIM provider, you should not need to worry about the contract falling apart because it is bound to the physical card itself.\nLet me explain:\nThat means that while a factory reset of the iPhone may sound like every piece of information linking back to you is permanently deleted, some data like the Serial Number, MAC address etc. is still unique to the device (hence doesn't change upon reset).\nAs logical links such as those created by the software (iOS) are prone to change, physical ones such as the unique identification mentioned above don't. If, and yes, only if the provider of the contract linked the SIM to your iPhone, it would most certainly be linked to the unique codes such as your iPhone's serial number - for greater accuracy.\nThe iPhone (or any phone for that matter) does not track your usage, the network provider does.\n\nA: Yeah that wouldn't be a problem at all.\nAs long as you have backed everything up prior to resetting you will be good to go.\nThe only thing you may lose is your current data use and other network related stats like that.\n", "Q: How to check if journaling is enabled or not on my disk? As usual the main internal drive on which macOS gets installed is journaled. I was going through some Ask Different posts in which there was something mentioned as Disk journaling which saves you from file corruptions but each time it registers the status of your file at the present time.These registrations might be having a huge impact on your CPU and Disk (My Assusmption), so is there any way by which I can check if my disk has journaling turned on or not and if it has how to turn it off via terminal?\nWhen I click on File Menu option via the menu bar after selecting my main Disk, this is what I get - Journaling is greyed out (I guess this option lights up if and only you are in recovery mode)\n\n\nA: You do not specify which version of macOS you are using. I will assume the current version (macOS 10.13.3).\nOpen the Disk Utility application and select the volume you wish to check. In the image below, \"MyFish\" has been selected.\n\nNote: For a better view of an image, either click on the image or open the image in a new window.\n\nNext, click on \"File\" in the menu bar. In the pulldown, you will see \"Enable Journaling\". If \"Enable Journaling\" is grayed out, then journaling is enabled, otherwise journaling is disabled. Below, the image shows the volume to have journaling enabled.\n\nThe older versions of macOS, would allow for journaling to be disabled directly from the Disk Utility application.

How?!\nAs a sidenote, I'm trying to make it easier to identify my ssh connections from within the cloud, as well as make my ssh connections not break between short sleeps; it seems there's an ssh_config(5) option called BindAddress, and it does appear to work (ssh -oBindAddress=2607:fb90:4b61:7474:8e29:XXff:feXX:XXXX …), but I'd prefer to have this configured without hardcoding the prefix that's still temporary in nature.  E.g., the solution I'm looking for likely involves system preferences; it's OK if it's not exclusive to ssh.\n\nA: A similar question on SuperUser prompted me to look into sysctl settings, with the following setting available to prefer the permanent IPv6 autoconf addresses to the temporary ones:\n% sudo sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.prefer_tempaddr=0\nPassword:\nnet.inet6.ip6.prefer_tempaddr: 1 -> 0\n% \n\nFor ssh sessions that aren't expecting any ongoing interaction, this would make it possible to go to sleep, and wake up within a number of minutes without any SSH connections suffering a disconnect (which would previously happen due to the prior IPv6 address being de-provisioned upon the wakeup from sleep).

So far, the only solution I could come up with is turning vibrations off in the sounds settings. Is there a better way to handle this situation? If not, who should I contact in this case? Apple or WhatsApp?\nThank you!\n\nA: This is intended behaviour. Do Not Disturb only enables Apple's features like phone and messages. It does not affect third-party applications.\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nIt has nothing to do with Apple's software. Do not disturb only affects Apple's core iOS features - the telephone app, the messaging app and iOS notifications service.  It does not interact with or affect third party apps.\n\nIf you want Whatsapp to implement the feature you need to contact them:\n\nIf you want WhatsApp to implement something similar, then you need to suggest it to the WhatsApp developers.  Or, close WhatsApp at night, and disable it in background app refresh in settings.\n\nTo provide a similar setting on Whatsapp you can close it at the desired time and turn on background app refresh which will prevent it from updating and receiving messages.\nTo turn off background app refresh\nGo to Settings -> General -> Background app refresh and turn of Whatsapp.\nTo completely turn all apps of from refreshing click at the top where it says background app refresh and click off.\n", "Q: What are the physical anti-theft protection for MacBook Pro (2015 Retina) Since the slot for Kensington cables has been removed from the MacBook Pro Retina: what are the possibility to physically protect a MacBook Pro (2015 and 15 inch model) against thieves? \nThe goal is to prevent the computer to be stolen in a library, coffee, conference room, hotel lobby when I am next to the computer, but not currently working on it (e.g. discussion with somebody else, looking for something in my bag...) and not to leave it alone in the open. \n\nA: You get a case with a lock.\nThe Ledge Case MacBook Pro Touch Bar Lock is a nice one that a relative showed me the other day, because he, like you tend to have their MacBook Pro out in the open in coffee shops and will leave it unattended. \n\nDisclaimer:  I have never used nor owned one of these because I simply won't leave any computer/device unattended.

The command man bash produces a lot of output. What I desire would be to either search the results or print the results to paper. So, is there a way to convert a man page to a html and/or pdf document.\nI would prefer the answer work for not only man bash, but rather for any man page.\nI know the output from man bash has been posted on the internet, but usually these posts are not current.\n\nA: Here is a function I added to my .bash_profile file to create a PDF of each BSD command I'd check the manual page for:\nmanp () \n{ \n    docDir=\"$HOME/Documents/BSD Commands\"\n    [[ ! -d $docDir ]] && mkdir -p \"$docDir\"\n    if [[ ! -f $docDir/$1.pdf ]]; then\n        man -t \"$1\" | pstopdf -i -o \"$docDir/$1.pdf\"\n        open \"$docDir/$1.pdf\"\n    else\n        open \"$docDir/$1.pdf\"\n    fi\n}\n\nSo, in Terminal, typing e.g. manp bash instead of man bash a PDF gets created, if it hasn't already been, and then opened by the app registered to handle PDF documents. The default is Preview, however on my system it's set to use Skim, as its search functionality is better then Preview and as a matter of fact will find the search string when Preview just will not.\nNote that the first time the function is used it will enumerate some fonts in the output in Terminal, however this is a one time enumeration of the fonts.\n\nAs a side note, typing just the command name in Terminal and then right-click on it and select Open man Page, displays it in a fully scrollable and searchable Terminal window, which is much better then typing e.g. man bash.\n\nA: Yes, there are numerous tools to convert manual pages to HTML and PDF.\nUNIX Approach\nConverting a man page to HTML, PDF, and text provides detailed instructions for macOS:\ncat /usr/share/man/man1/osascript.1 | groff -mandoc -Thtml >man_osascript.html\n\nIf the file ends in .gz, then substitute the following.\ngunzip --to-stdout /usr/share/man/man8/cupsfilter.8.gz | groff -mandoc -Thtml >man_cupsfilter.html\n\nFor converting from HTML to PDF:\ncupsfilter man_osascript.html > man_osascript.pdf\n\nFor other tool chains, see these related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I convert Linux man pages to HTML without using groff?\n\n*What's the easy way to convert all man pages to html?\n\n*Convert all Linux man pages to text / html or markdown\npandoc\nAnother approach is to use the popular pandoc tool.

This would be assessed on an app-by-app basis. You might get lucky with some, but you should research the requirements of the specific apps you'd like.\nYou could sync it with iTunes to listen to music and podcasts.\nYou could still make phone calls.\nYou can use iCloud for iMessage, Find My Friends/iPhone and syncing contacts etc.\nOverall the phone is still very much usable, but it may be frustratingly slow if you're used to newer models and I'd try to get one with at least 16gb if not the 32gb memory version. The 8gb model would have maybe 4gb of usable storage.\nAs a side note - there is still some stores that sell these phones, although most of them would be pre-owned/refurbished. €189 for a used one in Ireland from a reputable chain of stores. They seem to hold their value reasonably well, which shows that they are definitely a viable option.\n", "Q: Can /Library/Audio/ be safely deleted? After looking at How to completely remove Garage Band from macOS?, I was able to found /Library/Audio/Apple Loops/ and /Library/Audio/Apple Loops Index/ using ls and deleted them using rm -rf.\nBut I also found other folders:\n$ ls /Library/Audio/\nImpulse Responses   MIDI Configurations MIDI Devices\nMIDI Drivers        MIDI Patch Names    Plug-Ins        Sounds\n\nMy question is: can /Library/Audio/ and all its content be safely deleted?\n\nA: When you say \"safely\", I'm assuming you mean whether it can be deleted if you are not using Garageband, Logic, or any other DAW or audio software on your Mac. The answer is essentially yes. Even if you do use this software, the folder can be 'safely' deleted, as in it won't cause ill effects in the system - but naturally some functionality of the above apps may be impaire. If you were to open/run the Apple apps above, they'd likely just recreate the folder as needed.\nDeleting the folder will not affect your Mac's ability to play audio normally, such as alert sounds, music/audio on websites (YouTube and the like). It won't affect your Mac's stability or anything unexpected like that. While it appears to have a folder for 'Alerts', the actual alert sounds used by macOS are stored elsewhere.\nThis is one of the beautiful things about the logical, human-readable way that so much of macOS is laid out. You can go ahead and delete the folder without worry, but I might ask why you want to remove the folder? Personally, I would err on the side of caution and clear the contents of the folder, but leave the empty 'Audio' folder there, as a placeholder if nothing else. \n", "Q: Screen Color temperature flickers when watching a video on Safari when I'm watching a video on Safari (i.e. Netflix) every now and then the video momentarily becomes blueish or orange-ish.

See:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare for changes to macOS Server - Apple Support\n\nA: To answer the question(s)\n\nIs it possible to install LDAP on a regular mac running High Sierra?\n\nand \n\nCould my own iMac be the LDAP server for my organization in other\n  words?\n\nYes on both counts, though I wouldn't put LDAP server on a production workstation (if you turn off your iMac, LDAP goes down for everyone)  You could put it on a Mac mini (two would be better) and let it run as server 24/7.\nLDAP is just a service much like SSH, Apache, or DHCP.  You don't need a server version of an OS to run a server instance.\nOpenLDAP is available via Homebrew and you can run this on your plain macOS machine.\nThat said (non-Apple solution follows) I probably wouldn't run LDAP on a Mac - it's just too expensive (hardware wise).  I would get two cheap PCs, load up FreeBSD (what Mac is based on) and fire up OpenLDAP on each.  \n", "Q: Removing duplicate songs in an Apple Music playlist Is there any way to remove duplicate songs from an Apple Music playlist that I have?

Nope.\nSo with my understanding the only way to do this is to trick the OS into thinking the two projectors/monitors are actually one. So there is then the Matrox DualHead2Go. However that is expensive and for the amount I will use it I couldn't justify the cost.\nThus I was wondering, and I have looked, is there a Virtual Monitor Driver? Something that will do the same just in software? I did find two on GitHub but over 4 years old and will not work on anything > Mac OS 10.9.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: In your preferences, click display, arrangement, uncheck mirroring. That will extend your desktop across the two monitors. I do not believe that you can span your keynote presentation over multiple monitors the way PowerPoint can. If this is critical, a Windows machine using PowerPoint might be the easiest way ahead. \n", "Q: How to use the Terminal application to search or print a man page I often need to search or print a man page.

Grab can write a file too. \nThe issue occurs only with my user account but not with another (I created an new user to narrow down the failure area). My humble conclusion is that it must deal with my specific environment/configuration, but I have no clue how to narrow it down further or pin-point to the error prone configuration: \nSystem preferences → Keyboard → Shortcut does not give any hint: No error no warning. \nBoth shortcuts are assigned to the two system functions \"save picture of screen as a file respectively save picture of selected area as a file. \nI did disable/enable the checkbox, too;  no effect. I changed the target directory forth and back and restarted the UI Server; no obvious effect.\nAny idea how to figure out the root cause or better, how to fix the problem? \n\nA: tl;dr\nOpen the terminal and write\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture target file\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\n\nExplanation\nBeing on Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave), I ran into the same issue. At one point the screenshot shortcuts 'would not work' anymore. \n(I was able to save a screenshot to clipboard using Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+3, but it wouldn't work to save a screenshot to the desktop anymore.)\nLooking at the output of defaults read com.apple.screencapture in the terminal, I noticed a target = clipboard; being set:\n{\n    \"last-messagetrace-stamp\" = \"568547998.720744\";\n    location = \"/Users/kim/Desktop/\";\n    target = clipboard;\n}\n\nChanging the target back to file (defaults write com.apple.screencapture target file) and restarting the SystemUIServer (killall SystemUIServer) would restore the expected behaviour.\nIt looks like the new screenshot controls which were introduced in Mojave overwrite the target setting (Cmd+Shift+5, see the official apple support page for more information). When selecting \"Clipboard\" in the \"Save to\" menu, the target in com.apple.screencapture will also be set to clipboard. For some reason, this setting will then also affect the \"take screenshot to file\" shortcuts.\nNote: Of course, you could also reset the target setting in the new screenshot controls. Just choose any folder location in the \"Save to\" option (e.g. Desktop, Documents or any other location) and the target should be set to file again.\n\nA: That sounds to me like a misconfiguration of the target directory, perhaps it was changed at some point or the location is no longer valid. You mention having changed the target directory but didn't mention how. My guess is that the target directory was not entered correctly. Please verify it using the method below.\nDetermining the target location \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and type: defaults read com.apple.screencapture location\n\n*Check that the directory returned by the above command is a valid/accessible location on your mac by navigating to it through the Finder or using the command: open /path/to/returned/location - replacing the example path here with that which was returned by the above command.\n\n*If all was successful, you should see those screenshots from earlier, in that folder. If not, try the commands in the next section.\n\n\nWhat next?\nIf you had no success with the commands above, try changing the default location to which screenshots are saved.\nIn Terminal, type:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/to/new/location hit the enter/return key to execute the command. Note that it is best to drag the folder into the Terminal window for the correct path to be entered - this is where most mistakes happen. For changes to take effect, the SystemUIServer needs to be restarted with the killall SystemUIServer command.\nBy default, the target location for screenshots is the desktop at /Users/[username]/Desktop.\nAny unknown combination of events could have lead to the initial change so sometimes verifying and telling the system where to put the data once more is the quickest fix.\nI would be interested in following up with you on this, let me know if that was helpful or if you require any more information.\n\nA: My macOS refused to save to THAT custom folder (/Users/myuser/Pictures/Screenshot), no matter what I tried (deleting preferences, killing SystemUI, giving read&write permissions).\nThe system just decided it doesn't like that specific folder; anymore; while it used to work fine.\nThe only sane solution I found was to choose another folder and start to store screenshots there.\nIt's a senseless bug, not worth trying to fix it.\nSpare yourself frustration and choose simply another directory for screen-captures, via:\n\n*\n\n*⌘ Command ⇧ Shift5 -> Options -> Other folder..\n\n*or via defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/myuser/Pictures/ScreenCaptures (or whatever other folder you prefer)\n\n", "Q: How do I add space to my Bootcamp partition?

But now my Bootcamp partition doesn't appear when restarting holding Option. I also can't create an image of my Windows partition using Disk Utility in Mac, says I don't have permission.\nI read that you could just split the Mac partition, reboot into Windows and use Minitool Partition Wizard to add the split space into Bootcamp. How can I get this to work? Thank you for any help.\n\nA: You could try this : with Disk Utility, restore you Mac volume to its original size (no free space left between the Mac volume and the Windows partition), then launch Boot Camp assistant from Mac OS (in /Applications/Utilities), and use the Boot Camp assistant for redistributing free space between Mac OS and Windows partitions.\n", "Q: Is FaceTime Audio and Video encrypted? Is FaceTime audio and video really encrypted? So that we don’t have to worry about anyone listening to our calls when we call using FaceTime?\n\nA: Absolutely it is!\nOn Apple's Approach to Privacy page, you will find the following statement under the iMessage and FaceTime section:\n\nWe use end-to-end encryption to protect your iMessage and FaceTime conversations across all your devices. With watchOS and iOS, your messages are encrypted on your device so that they can’t be accessed without your passcode. We designed iMessage and FaceTime so that there’s no way for us to decrypt your data when it’s in transit between devices. You can choose to automatically delete your messages from your device after 30 days or a year or to keep them on your device forever...\n  ...and we never store the content of FaceTime calls on any servers.\n\nLet me know if that was helpful or if you have any further questions regarding that statement.\n", "Q: How to separate iCloud Drive from Desktop & Documents How do I separate iCloud Drive from Desktop and Documents?\nI accidentally clicked on an option to have iCloud store all of the desktop files, then all of the sudden, iCloud ran out of storage.\nI got rid of iCloud Drive but all my files disappeared off the desktop. Luckily, I was able to restore them through iCloud.\nNow I am looking for a way to have iCloud and the Desktop back to default behavior (separate) - without deleting all my files. How do I do that?\nSide question:\nIf I used TimeMachine with iCloud backing up my desktop, all files on the desktop would also be copied to TimeMachine, right?\n\nA: To answer your first question:\nDeactivate storing your Desktop & Document files in iCloud by doing the following:\nClick Apple Menu (in the upper left corner of the menu bar) -> System Preferences -> iCloud -> Click Options (next to iCloud Drive) -> Uncheck Desktop & Documents Folders -> Turn Off -> Done.\nWhat may seem counterintuitive is that your files are still stored in the iCloud ( which is perhaps why you thought you lost them). \nTo retrieve your files, you should open Finder and navigate to iCloud Drive, and then to the Documents folder within iCloud Drive. You should then manually transfer or copy the files from that directory to the local Documents directory on your computer. You should then do that same with your Desktop folder.\nAnswer to your second question here: Does Time Machine backup iCloud Drive files that are not stored locally?\n\nA: First of all: after ticking off the iCloud Drive box in iCloud preferences in macOS, you should be presented with the option to either delete the copies from your Mac, OR leave a copy on your Mac...\nIf not (which would be strange) you can, before disabling iCloud Drive, move you files from your Desktop and Documents folder to folders with the same names (to help you distinguish them) outside of the synced Documents and Desktop folders. That could be a newly made folder in your Home folder (a level higher).\nWhile moving, iCloud Drive will warn you that these files will be delete from iCloud (which is exactly what your want).\nAfter the proces, you can disable iCloud Drive.\n", "Q: iLife Slideshows screen saver not working after update to macOS High Sierra 13.13.3 My screen saver - that shuffles between a list of files in a folder - have stopped working after I updated to 13.13.3.

Based on the tip from @DocG, \n\n\n*\n\n*I went into my Hard Drive (at the bottom of the Finder left hand list) > Library > Screen Savers and moved that folder to the Trash. \n\n*Then I went into one of my Timemachine backups from a time when I was able to tap into my Photos and selected that same folder from within Timemachine and clicked Restore.\n\n\nAnd voilà! My own wonderful photos are back & flipping around my screen saver.\n", "Q: Timestamp display in macOS Finder I noticed some very odd behaviour in macOS High Sierra's (10.13.1) Finder.\nFor filenames that contain timestamps Finder changes the timestamp format, the two screenshots below illustrate the issue.  \n\nAny idea how to stop Finder from changing the time stamp?\n\nA: Explanation\nThat's because the file you created through the terminal using the touch command was named that way by you (not the system) upon creation. What happens is that upon creation, the system interprets your chosen filename and checks whether it contains any \"illegal characters\".\nIn macOS, the only \"illegal\" filename character is colon symbol (:). This is because macOS use these in path names e.g. Macintosh HD:Applications:Safari.app. Additionally, file and folder names may be up to 255 characters in length.\nThe replacement of : into / is an automatic function built-in to macOS to prevent file path corruption through inadvertently placing a colon in the middle of a file name - which would change the entire path. You will not be able to adjust this behavior.\nWhat about Screenshots?\nAs for the screenshots, their file names do not contain any so-called \"illegal;\" characters and are hence valid.\nAdditionally, changing the screenshot file name is also very easy in macOS. In Terminal, run defaults write com.apple.screencapture name \"Some Name\" - replacing Some Name with your own text.\n", "Q: How can I diagnose my MacBook Pro Start-up problem? I have a MacBook Pro 8,1 (Early 2011) / 8GB (2x4GB RAM) /256 SSD  and was running El Captain. One morning I couldn't boot it up. \nAfter doing the Apple Hardware Test which showed faulty RAM I put back my old 4GB (2x2GB) RAM sticks, retested and had no errors. I had all my data on an external drive so I did a complete restore back to Lion 10.7.5. After installing the system, the Spinning wheel of death appears very frequently, but I put that down the indexing which had a remaining time of 5 days. After rebooting the system once, I couldn't boot it again. \nI have done the hardware test multiple times since then and everything checks out fine. I have installed Lion twice since then also, but if I do a restart it never boots further than the grey Apple logo and spinning wheel  like the very first time. I have tried all start-up options. Safe-mode never boots. At the moment I am trying the \"Choose Startup Disk\" option and choose the partition but I only see the wheel of death. \nAfter doing a verbose boot, the system did infact reboot after approximately 3 hours. However, even just entering my login password brings back the spinning wheel of death which runs for a couple of minutes so that the mac is effectively useless and then \"kernel panic\".\nHow can I diagnose what is going on here?

I'm looking to save some space on my internal drive and noticed that com.apple.bird takes lots of space - 76 Gb to be exact.\nAs I understand from What is com.apple.bird? Why does it grow so big? it's part of the iCloud stuff and should only keep the data temporarily. This wasn't true for my machine in the past 3 years. No matter what I did to it it just kept growing to the same size.\nNow my question is whether it is safe to move com.apple.bird to an external drive and just create a symlink to the folder on the external drive?\n\nA: This process contains cache for Apps using iCloud-Backup. Might check to see which applications are using the most space in your Library/Caches/com.apple.bird folder. \nThere is a script available here https://github.com/bwesterb/blame-bird to help with that. \n\nA: The easy way to do this is to move your entire home folder to the external drive. Apple designs their OS to have the user home folder portable, but everything inside that home folder really derives from the location / storage of the folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move user folder (HDD) back to main drive (SSD)\n\n*Move Documents folder to different drive\nYou can sometimes override the location of things like iTunes Music Library or iPhoto Library (the parts that don't cache down from the internet).\nMoving bird and the sync data is one item that seems exceptionally hard to do technically and likely to cause breakage and errors. Have you considered reducing the storage or moving other files off the boot volume so your iCloud local cache can be on the same storage as the user folder (and optionally the OS itself?)? That clearly isn't what you hoped, but with this details - maybe you can move all user files or come up with a different accommodation.\nIf you boil this down to a yes/no question on macOS 10.13, I would say it's not safe to try to move that data elsewhere and you'd want to thin the data entering iCloud of you don't want 76 GB of it on the Mac where your home folder exists.\n", "Q: iOS Ad-Tracker blockers.

Touchbar breaks my external keyboard, and the option to use all fn keys as fn keys is gone. Is there a way to do so anyway? For me the whole touchbar thing is completely useless, and I'd prefer only having it while I hold the fn key, like it works when I add a single app in the settings\nSierra 10.12, 2017 model\n\nA: If you go to Settings > Keyboard, in the Keyboard pane, the box \"Touch Bar shows\" select \"F1, F2, etc. Keys\" as the option.\nThe touch bar will now just show Fn keys as if it was a normal keyboard. (They will dim and appear black sometimes.)\nThen, you can change the setting directly below, \"Press Fn key to\" and select \"Expand Control Strip\" or \"Show App Controls\". This will fulfill your request to \"only have it while I hold the fn key.\"\nHope this helps!\n\nA: In addition to Bens answer, I found a new option which is more to my liking: I can use F1 etc as usual on my external keyboard and leave the original setting on the macbooks keyboard. This is good for me, since I use fn keys only when coding, and I only code with a proper keyboard. When I am on the road, I usually write, so it's fine to have the touchbar as it was designed.\n\n", "Q: A1185 Macbook battery not charging because of low voltage (capacity is still good).

I am aware that I can set small-caps on and off by clicking into a menu.\nDoes anyone have a suggestion as to what I'm doing wrong or what I can do to make this character style possible?\n\nA: To create a new style, you need to have some text with ONLY that style selected: if in the style inspector the \"Characters Styles\" dropdown menu shows \"multiple styles\" or \"none\" or the name of an existing style WITHOUT a trailing '*', the \"new style\" button will be grayed out.\n\nA: As Gio Valerio said, it works as intuitively as you'd expect—except it didn't work for me when I tried originally.\nThe answer is: Edit text as desired and look at the character style menu, and hope that the \"new style\" button isn't grayed out.\n", "Q: Change equation font in Pages During a Pages update which was pushed out a few months ago, Pages obtained the ability to write equations using LaTeX or MathML commands. According to an Apple Support article, the size and color of the equation can be changed (source):\n\nThe equation appears at the insertion point in your document (or before the selected text). The equation is an inline object, the same size and color as the surrounding text. If you change the size or color of the surrounding text, the size and color of the equation’s font also change.\n\nThis does not mention anything about the font used for the equation itself, which seems to be something similar to a Times New Roman font.\nIs there any way to change the font used, preferably to something like Latin Modern Math?\nI was considering the possibility of replacing the font file Pages uses with a downloaded Latin Modern Math font file, but I'm not sure what to replace. Could I replace Times New Roman in /System/Library/Fonts/ or something like that?\n\n\nA: This very point has bothered me - I detest the fact that the font in my equations is so different to the rest of my doc.  I explored various methods for changing font but none worked.  Yesterday I stumbled across a brilliant hack for this (though not entirely fullproof).\nPages supports the /text{} command, which can be embedded anywhere.  The command is meant for including full words around equations so they don't look so odd.\nHow to use it within equations?  Surround characters, or groups of characters with the /text{} command.  Here are some examples:\nPut an overline over a character styled like the paragraph format:\n\\overline \\text{v} \\text{= ½(u+v)} ➝ v̄ = ½(u+v)\nPut correctly styled characters into a fraction:\n\\text{t =} \\frac{\\text{v-u}}{\\text{a}} ➝ t = (v–u) / a\nPut correctly styled characters into a squareroot:\n\\text{F =} \\sqrt{\\text{134.6}} \\text{= 11.6\\ N} ➝ F = √134.6 = 11.6 N\nHere is a visual example:\n\nCode for top equation:\nx + \\frac{y}{x} = 4\n\nBottom equation:\n\\text{x} + \\frac{\\text{y}}{\\text{z}} = \\text{4}\n\nA huge advantage of this is you select the equation object and do whatever font styling you like to the object and all the characters inside /text{} get styled accordingly.  It's great.  Makes it easy to add bespoke styling to different equations easily, e.g. choose a specific font, add italics, make one eqaution bold because it is a final solution to multiple steps.\nAnother benefit has been the ability to insert a correct degree symbol, º, which usually causes the equation editor to fail.\nOne main limitation that I am aware of is super and subscripts.  You can style the characters inside a superscript or subscript command, e.g. \\text{sin}^{\\text{-1}}\\text{(0.96)}, but the characters inherit their size from the paragraph styling so they stay normal size - doesn't look right.  In these cases I have resorted to either using the default font supplied in the equation editor or using Unicode (e.g. ⁻¹).\nAnyway, I hope that this method adds some value to your work if you decide to try it out.\n\nA: This is not possible to change the font as the LaTex panel as it is strictly in maths mode.\n\nThe LaTeX insertion panel in Pages v6.2 is strictly in math mode, and does not allow changing to another font (e.g. Helvetica), as one could do in the main Pages document body, or in LaTeX proper. You can change to a different style for the default font as outlined in the blahtex/blahtexml guide (direct link to PDF). The usage of these operators is not further documented, and though \\mathsf{x = y^2} works, this format does not apply for all in the following list.\n\n(source)\nSome of the fonts, not all are available:\n\n\nA: Pages uses blahtex to generate PNGs from the rudimentary maths environments. The following fonts are available out of the box with blahtex:\n\n2.12 Fonts\n\\mathbf \\mathbb \\mathrm \\mathit \\mathcal \\mathfrak \\mathsf \\mathtt \\boldsymbol \\rm \\bf \\it \\cal \\tt \\sf \\Bbb \\bold\n\nUnfortunately, Pages does not support all of these fonts, most notably mathcal. Pages does support:\n\n…and their shorthands:\n\n", "Q: Downgrade itunes in high sierra So I need to downgrade itunes to 12.0.1 for a jailbreak (6.1.6 on ipod 4g).

This is only when I launch a GUI Application.\n\nA: When I launched these Java programs (why only Java applications I honestly don't know...) I remember I inserted a network sharing shortcut in the Mac OS dock.\nI think MacOS as a side effect tried to analyse this folder (which is in fact a network storage) while it was in the dock ; which causes all these lags since the network shared folder is not all the time connected (when I'm not @ home, or even if I am at home and the NAS is sleeping).\nTL;DR If you have any kind of network shared / FTP folder as a shortcut in your Mac OS dock you may try to remove it to see if the lags are disappearing.\n", "Q: Can I calculate the size of HFS Time Machine local snapshots from the command line?

Is this possible on macOS?\n\nA: Take a look at the \"Storage\" tab of \"About This Mac\" from the Apple menu (System Information.app). It should show as one of the colored portions of the bar. The cool thing is, with APFS and its file-and-block level cloning, the answer is probably \"not a whole lot\". I know it can seem strange. If you haven't experienced this yourself yet: take a big file (5-6GB) and use cp -c to copy it 20 times. You won't see a byte more of storage used until you edit any of the copies. du doesn't look that \"deep\" (to the level of block allocation), so it will double count everything.\nIf you have a LOT of very large and very rapidly changing files (like you're editing a feature film or something), where lots of changes are made to very large files multiple times a day, it might be worth disabling local snapshots. But honestly, I wouldn't worry about it unless it's seriously impacting your work or something. Time Machine knows how and when to prune older backups and snapshots to make sure it doesn't overgrow itself.\n\nA: The info shown in \"About this Mac > Storage\" isn't exactly showing you the size of all Time Machine snapshots.  It includes other purgeable disk space that's marked that way for other reasons.\nI don't know how to find the size of an a particular snapshot, but you can find the combined size of all snapshots of a particular path using the undocumented sizelocalsnapshotsof verb on tmutil.\n$ sudo tmutil sizelocalsnapshotsof ~/.config\n283 KB (282,624 bytes) used by snapshots of '/Users/chris/.config' (126915 total blocks, 69 unique blocks).\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*It undocumented, so be wary.\n\n*If you pass in an invalid path you get an exception and a stack trace. You must pass in a path that's being included in your time machine local snapshots.\n\n*It takes a LONG time to run on large folders, so be prepared for the wait.  You could just run it on / and get the combined size of all snapshots, but when I did that it ran for 20 minutes before I just cancelled it and gave up.\n\n", "Q: How to run httpd on macOS without Apache I'm trying to build a BCHS application.

It has 12 lovely cores.\nBut, when I look at the CPU activity in the CPU History half of the rows are blank (image below).\nDoes this suggest one of my CPUs isn't working?\n \n\nA: Each alternate line is a hyper threaded core, not a real core - count the lines, there are 24, not 12.\nIf you're doing something processor-intensive, it makes more sense to use real cores, so tasks first share out to all the top line of each virtual pair.\nEdit for new image\nImage showing  \n\n\n*\n\n*to the left - 2 simultaneous [yet separate apps] 3rd party app video conversions, still only the real cores needed - presumably the app threads according to the number of actual cores, for speed.

There are 24 rows in your CPU history, and there's activty in 12 of them. I.e. every core is accounted for.\nThe reason that you have extra rows are probably that your CPU supports HyperThreading. HyperThreading does not mean that you have double the amount of cores, but rather that in some (rarer) cases, the system might be able to run two operations at the same time on a single core.\nSo everything is as it is supposed to be.\n", "Q: Change Local Admin passwords across the network Is there a way to change admin passwords for all my Macs connected to my network.\nI know the local admin password for all PC's in my network and I need to just to change password for Username: admin\nWhat I have to do is physically go to each Mac, login and change the password manually.

The downside to this is that decent performing apps like this will cost money - and they're quite expensive\n\n*Going to each machine and not just enabling the password, but turning on remote login and/or management as well.\nI prefer the latter option because it will ultimately give you much more control over your network connected nodes.  As for security, you can configure sshd on each machine to only allow logins from an SSH key.  See this answer on how to log in with keys rather than username/passwords.\nYou didn't mention how many Macs you have on your network and the project could be considerable.

I use several news apps on my iPhone X. When I read an article, I often want to search for a specific term within the article (similar to Ctrl-F, \"Find\", in a browser). How do I do that?\n\nA: Apple doesn't index every bit of text in every app (that's not their own app, like Notes).  It's up to the app developer to add a search function or to explicitly make their content searchable by Apple.  The latter part is becoming more popular because the iOS Spotlight function is getting better.\nFor example, if I do a Spotlight search on my iPhone for 'plex', the results include the Plex app that I have in addition to several emails I've received from Plex.  These emails are in the Spark email app, so that means that developer added the code to make their content available to Spotlight searches.\nAt this point, it's hit-or-miss if your app supports this.  Often, the developer will indicate if this feature is available on their iTunes page.\n\nA: As a workaround, I'd open that article in Safari and put the term in the URL bar and choose 'On this page' option.\n", "Q: How do I stop daghesh from moving when typing in Hebrew When typing in Hebrew on macOS 10.13, the daghesh sometimes 'jumps' from one character to another.

Anyone know of such a thing?\n\nA: I assume you mean kernel panic:\n\nKernel Panic, though sounding scary, is simply an occurrence when your Mac restarts for no obvious reason. Your Mac’s screen goes black giving you various warning messages like “You need to restart your computer.” Note that the presence of the warning message is what distinguishes Kernel Panic from usual Mac restarts and app crashes. In other words, Kernel Panic is just a Mac version of “blue screen of death” on Windows.\n\nTo start a kernel panic, you can issue the following command from Terminal:\nsudo dtrace -w -n \"BEGIN{ panic();}\"\n\nYou will need to disable SIP if you have El Capitan or later. You can find instructions to do it here. It works for any version of macOS that has SIP, but you should NOT do it unless you really need to, since it is a security risk.

So far, each Mac has been backed up on individual hard drives.\nI am trying to perform a backup of my internal SSD (500GB), as well as my my external HDD (around 1.1 TB of data). So, I am trying to backup 1.6TB at the moment via Time Machine as the initial backup.\nMy first attempt to get this to work, was by following Synology's instructions. I was able to discover the Time Machine folder on my NAS and TM started it's initial backup. After several GB of data transfer the backup stopped. No error message but not even near completion. Time Machine stated: 'Waiting to complete first backup'. Nothing happened after that. It transferred around 9GB of data but that was it. In case I did a mistake setting up the folder and user on my NAS, I reset the NAS and started from scratch. Same result... After a couple GB the NAS was again stuck and said 'Waiting to complete first backup'.\nAfter some research I found a helpful Synology thread. I disabled HDD hibernation, disabled AFP. In a nutshell these are my current settings:\nFile share configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use BTRFS\n\n*\"Advanced data integrity protection\" is enabled\n\n*Encryption is disabled (for now - would like to have it but want to be able to get backups working first)\n\n\nUser configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Standard user with a strong, random password.\n\n*Granted read/write access to Time machine file share and set quota of 3TB.\n\n\nFile services:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have SMB enabled only - AFP is disabled.\n\n*Enabled Bonjour Service Discovery and Bonjour Time Machine broadcast via SMB.\n\n*Selected the Time Machine Folder\n\n\nWhile all my first attempts were to get the initial TM backup to work over WIFI, I also tried connecting the NAS directly to my Mac. I enabled DHCP on my NAS, connected it via an ethernet cable to my Mac and started another backup. It got further than via wifi but again, it did not finish the backup. I let my Mac run over night, staying connected to my NAS, hoping the backup would finish... In the morning I was greeted by the same message again: 'Waiting to complete first backup'.\nMy Mac's power options are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when display if off [ENABLED]\n\n*Put hard disk to sleep when possible [DISABLED]\n\n*Wake for network access [ENABLED]\n\n*Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter [ENABLED]\n\n\nNow, I am stuck too. I cannot think of what else I could possibly try to get Time Machine to backup to my NAS. This really has been some struggle so far... Looking forward to hear any thoughts and ideas :-)\nThank you very much in advance,\njrn\n\nA: I've got a setup very similar to yours: a 480GB SSD and 1TB HD; both internal (718GB full backup reported in TM). I've been backing up to a DS213 successfully using AFP, and I'm setting up a DS418play using SMB. The Synology forums have conflicting posts regarding making TM work, including the one you reference. Another suggests TM has problems with DSM's SMB implementation, using SAMBA 4.4 (https://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=139097). Nevertheless, I have both working for TM backups: AFP on the DS213 and SMB on DS418.\nMy working config seems the same as yours.

(TM is full of strange arcanery -- don't put all your eggs in one basket) \nUpdate: I periodically see see an error saying \"The networked backup disk does not support the required capabilities.\" In this case, reset the SMB Cache in DSM's SMB advanced settings. This will allow TM to back up again. For a while. \n\nA: Check volume name for non-core-ASCII characters\nI experienced the same problem as the OP, and followed @jonathan-dagle's answers precisely. It got it working once, but when I wanted to change the settings slightly, I never got it back up (pun semi-intended).\nIn my case, it seems the name of the Time Machine volume on the diskstation was the problem. The Swedish translation of Backups is Säkerhetskopior, and apparently the ä caused problems, because as soon as I changed the name to something without that character it worked again.\n\nA: I had the same issue on Catalina (10.15.7). When the sparsebundle was created by Time Machine, for some reason it only created the plist file inside the of the directory and not the rest of the directory structure.\nWhen I tried creating a test sparsebundle with Disk Utility, that worked fine and created the proper structure with a bands subdirectory.\nEventually I found that the permissions for for shared folder were the cause:\nroot@NAS:/volume2/TimeMachine# ls -la\ntotal 12\nd---------+ 1 root  root   170 Dec 14 10:42 .\n\nI suspect that Time Machine performs some extra unneeded unix permission checks and concluded that the permissions are wrong, even though it did have all required permissions through ACLs (+ at the end of the permission flags).\nAfter changing these to my user account (replace 'myuser' with your username), the backup worked fine:\nroot@NAS:/volume2/TimeMachine# chown myuser .\nroot@NAS:/volume2/TimeMachine# chmod u+rwx\nroot@NAS:/volume2/TimeMachine# ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwx------  1 myuser root   104 Dec 14 10:48 .\n\n", "Q: Merge all space into one volume I wanted to delete all my partitions and merge all the space to the Macintosh HD but I made a mistake by taking the Macintosh HD volume out of the physical storage list.

So, whilst you can find photos in which persons X, Y AND Z all appear together, you can't easily find photos which feature either persons ［X AND Y］ OR ［X AND Z］ using a single Smart Album (you would need to go through the trouble of multiple Smart Albums and—depending on how complex your search requirements become—using the Smart Album(s) to make regular albums that can be referenced by criteria of any subsequent Smart Album to narrow its search scope.

Dual-link DVI refers to the number of data channels (double) that is available for more bandwidth meaning higher resolution.  It's not a \"second connection\" and you cannot \"split\" the signals.

This has given me an idea: ripping CD's with my iBook and bringing them over to my newer computer. \nIs there a piece of free software for classic Mac OS which is capable of ripping lossless audio files from CD's for free ?\n\nA: As far as I remember (AFAIR), no extra software is required to rip audio CDs lossless in Mac OS 9. You can simply open the CD and use the Finder to copy the music files to the hard disk.\nThe final data format is AIFF.\nThis probably won't work for copy protected audio CDs (non-Red Book).\n\nA: While I am a big proponent of of not throwing away useful tech, there is a point (for me) of diminishing returns.

I have also tried to create another login account but the keyboard/trackpad fail to work there as well.\nI have also tried SMC / PRAM reset multiple times and also reinstalled the OS from recovery mode, but again failure.\nThe only abnormalities that I have found are that 1) the multi touch kernel extension does not have a Plugins directory which is a different structure than all the other kext directories.\n\n~ Fri Feb 16 20:19:11\n$ ls /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBMultitouch.kext/Contents/\nInfo.plist      MacOS/          _CodeSignature/ version.plist\n\nand 2) there is no option to disable the trackpad in the accessibility preferences pane.\n\nDoes anyone have any guesses as to what might be going on ?\n\nA: It seems that somehow the bits in the registry had gotten flipped. I tried two things: 1) I changed the configuration settings and 2) I removed all bluetooth daemons \n## 1\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad USBMouseStopsTrackpad 0\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad USBMouseStopsTrackpad 0\n\n## 2\nkillall blued\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.bluetoothd.plist \nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.bluetoothaudiod.plist \nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.bluetoothReporter.plist \nkextcache -system-prelinked-kernel\nsudo kextcache -system-prelinked-kernel\n\nBased on the fact that the keyboard did not work even in safe mode, it seems that the first thing worked, since the keyboard and trackpad are working now after I restarted the computer.\n\nA: hello guys if someone still has to suffer from the same problem I have the solution worked for me. You have to open your Mac:\n1 - disconnect the battery\n2 - remove the keyboard and mouse connectors\n3 - make a small cleaning in the region and reconnect the connectors\n4 - With the battery still disconnected, connect the charger and do the nvram (option + comand + P + R).\nHugs, I hope I have helped\n", "Q: Answer a phone call from iPhone screen with airpods in without disconnection from airpods Sometimes my Airpods do not respond to my taps, so I have gotten into the habit of answering phone calls from the iPhone screen if a call comes in while I am wearing the Airpods. However, if I answer from the phone, the device seems to think I want to talk through the phone itself, and automatically disconnects me from the Airpods. I have to then press the  \"Speaker\" button, and then choose my Airpods from the list, and only then am I able to talk through the Airpods. \nMy question is, is it possible to answer the phone from the screen while the Airpods are connected without being disconnected? With the wired Apple earphones, this does not happen. I.e., if you have them plugged in and answer a call, the earphones are not suddenly bypassed for the device speaker and mic. If this is not a bug, I am sure Apple has their reasons for this behavior, but I wonder if there is a workaround or a setting I can tweak. Thanks!\n\nA: Apple assumes that wherever you answer from is where you want to hear the audio.\nThe fact that your AirPods are unresponsive to your taps is a separate issue (maybe Apple will address in future updates). The expected behavior is that if you want to answer on your AirPods, you'll tap on them.\n"]
