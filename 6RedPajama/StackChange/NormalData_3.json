["Q: How do I migrate my Aperture library from my primary HDD to an external drive? I have about 53GB of photos in my Aperture library which is stored on my internal HDD. I would like to move this library onto an external hard disk and continue to use Aperture without any loss of images, etc. \nIs there anyway I can do this? \n\nA: Yes you can, here are the steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your external disk\n\n*Open Finder and go to <your home folder>/Pictures\n\n*move the Aperture Library.aplibrary file to a location on your new disk\n\n*Open Aperture and go to preferences ( from menu or by pressing ⌘+, )\n\n*On the General tab, change the location of the library to where you copied the Aperture Library.aplibrary file\n\n\nThat's it, the library is now on your external drive.\n\nA: Or before opening Aperture, hold down the Option/Alt key then click o Aperture to open. Aperture will ask you where your library is, then you can point it to your external drive.  \n", "Q: How can I write a tab character in Safari? I tried using the tab key with the modifier keys, but I didn't get Safari to write a tab character in a text field shown in an HTML page.\nIs it possible to do it? If it is possible, how can I do it?\n\nA: Enable the \"Unicode Hex Input\" input method from System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources and then type Option 0009.\n\nA: Press Cmd-Alt-T to bring up \"Special Characters...\" in the Edit menu.\nSearch for \"tab\" and click Insert. You're looking for the one named \"Character tabulation\"\nThe website may not display it correctly,\nbut it will indent code.\n\n\nA: I usually wind up typing a tab in TextEdit or Stickies and copy-and-pasting it in Safari.\n\nA: The Wikipedia article titled Control key reports the following text:\n\nUnder Mac OS X, the Control key allows the use of Emacs-style key combinations in most text entry fields. For example, Ctrl-A moves the caret to the start of the paragraph, Ctrl-L vertically centers the current line in the editing field, Ctrl-K cuts text to the end of the line to a kill ring separate from the normal clipboard, etc.\n\nThe table before that note reports that Ctrl-Q works as \"Literal insert.\" I tried entering Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-I in Safari 5.0.4, and I get a tab in the text entry. \nIt doesn't work on SE sites, as those combinations are used, respectively, to start a quoted text and emphasized text.\nIt doesn't seem to work on Safari 5.1, or Firefox 4.\n\nA: You can use control-option-tab.\nIn other applications you can use option-tab, but in Safari tab and option-tab are used to select elements in web views.\n", "Q: amplify sound output on Mac \nPossible Duplicate:\nDo you know a simple sound booster app for Mac? \n\nIs there an app to amplify sound output on Mac OS X, I've put the volume to max and it's still quiet.\n\nA: Boom is a simple program that does nothing except boost the system volume past its maximum. It can also increase the volume of audio files, although iTunes can also do this. It does cost money, but only $5.\n\nA: VLC can boost the volume for stuff played through it by 400%.  Your internal speakers might not like being pushed that hard though.  You could also try the preamp on the iTunes equalizer.  To use the equalizer, in iTunes, click Window > Equalizer and slide the preamp slider upwards.  Also, for a system-wide solution there's Audio Hijack but you need to pay for the full product.\n", "Q: Are There Any Text Browsers for iOS? I want a text-only browser on my iPod. It is not jailbroken (nor do I wish to do so), and it is running iOS 4.2.1. Does anyone know of a way to install any text browser on iOS without jailbreaking? Any of these text browsers would be awesome;\nLynx, Edbrowse, w3m, Elinks, Links, Emacs/W3, Net-Tamer, WebbIE, etc\n\nA: You could go on your iPod to a website like http://pizzaseo.com/tool-lynx.php to emulate the behavior.\n\nA: You could use Atomic Web Browser and turn on Web Compression (uses Google mobilizer). This should leave you with a minimum of graphics on the page.\n", "Q: Is there an application that moves menulets from the menu bar, and shows them in a little window? Is there a utility that shows the menulets in a window in the style of the old Control Strip (which means a window that automatically shows and hides)?\n\nA: It's not exactly the style used by the old Control Strip, but Bartender hides the menu extra icons, and show them in a little window that appears when clicking on its menu extra icon.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Lets you tidy your menu bar apps how you want.\n  \n*See your menu bar apps when you want.\n  \n*Hide the apps you need to run, but do not need to see.\n  \n*Have the clean looking menu bar you want.\n  \n*Rearrange your menu bar items as you wish.\n  \n\n\nFor each icon shown in the Menu Bar, it let you decide where the icon should be shown (Bartender Bar versus Manu Bar), and how long the item should be shown when it is updated.\n\n\nA: Short answer is no.\nThe menulets are controlled by SystemUIServer, a system application in charge of a number of things one of them being the right side of the menu bar. Unfortunately SystemUIServer is not replaceable, and its behavior cannot be changed.\nNote that there are multiple kinds of 'menulets':\n\n\n*\n\n*System provided menus (the clock, airport signal, time machine...). These do use a private API as they run code inside SystemUIServer and Apple doesn't like people loading code in this sensitive piece of software. Those are present on disk with a '.menu' extension. Those are sitting on the right of the menu bar.\n\n*Third party menus using the private API without Apple blessing. Those usually use a hack to bypass Apple protection (most common hack is MenuCracker, code is on SourceForge). Some of those menus are good and respectful of their environment, some of them are not. Those menulets are freely mixable with the system ones, you can ⌘-drag and drop them to reorder them.\n\n*Applications deciding to provide a quick access menu on the menubar. Those do run in their own process and use a public API to place themselves on the menubar. You cannot reorder them and they always sit on the left of the system menus. SystemUIServer control those icons placement.\nIt could be possible to write an application capable of loading menulets by emulating the private API, but a number of things will not work as expected (toggle in preferences will not toggle in this app, I'm not sure that some menulets do not use some of SystemUIServer internals...). And anyway, no matter what you do there is no way to control the application positions.\n\nA: A quick Google search landed me on this: Return of Control Strip [macworld.com]\nI am not really sure whether this will help you because I have never used Mac OS Classic.\n\nA: Although I do not know of any utility that shows the menulets in a little window, I do know how to move the menulets.\nHolding command while pressing down on any of the menulets will allow you to move them.\nYou can try it on any Apple-made menulet products except Spotlight.\n", "Q: AppleScript or Automator Workflow for Bulk-Converting Powerpoint Presentations to Keynote I have a large set of Powerpoint presentations that I would like to convert to Keynote. I can convert each one manually by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, right-click Powerpoint document and select Open With... -> Keynote\n\n*In Keynote, choose Save As..., check the Save copy as checkbox, select iWork '08 as the format, and click OK.\n\n\nHowever, doing this for each document is tedious. I'd like a way to convert them all at once.\nI've been trying to create an Automator workflow for this, but have been completely unsuccessful.  (I think being a programmer actually makes it impossible to understand the for-the-rest-of-us tools like Automator and AppleScript.)  Can anyone help me out?\n\nA: I couldn't figure out how to get Automator to do it, but I was able to beat AppleScript into submission.  Just save the following as an Application in the AppleScript Editor, then drag the files you want to convert onto the icon.  It will prompt you to choose a folder where the converted files will be placed.\non open droppedFiles\n    set theDestinationFolder to (choose folder with prompt \"Choose destination folder\") as Unicode text\n    repeat with theFile in droppedFiles\n        tell application \"Keynote\"\n            open theFile\n            set theSlideshow to slideshow 1\n            set theDestinationPath to theDestinationFolder & (name of theSlideshow)\n            save theSlideshow in theDestinationPath\n            close theSlideshow\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend open\n\n(I don't really know what I'm doing with AppleScript. If there are improvements that can be made here, I'd like to know about them.)\n\nA: Did you try to create an Automator workflow using the feature Watch Me Do (which seems appropriate here) ? What problems did you encounter ?\n", "Q: How can I transfer iPhone + iPad data to a new computer? I have iTunes installed on my old computer (Win XP) and all iPhone + iPad apps + all backups are done on this computer.\nNow I would like to use iTunes on my new computer (Win 7) and retire the old one.\nMy experiments so far went really bad. If I do the obvious thing and install iTunes on the new computer, then try to sync the iPhone, it completely wipes the iPhone and all app data. That happens even though the iTunes account is the same as on the old computer.\nMy goal is simple: I want to be able to sync/backup both iPhone and iPad on the new computer without having to completely install all apps again and loosing all the app data on the devices.\nThis seems to be such an obvious thing - to switch to a new computer - am I just not seeing the easy way to do this?\n\nA: There's an Apple guide to this process \nThere's also this guide on HowToGeek.com\n\nA: From my experience, unless you use Time Machine or Migration Assistant, it's not that easy task we'd expect it to be. Here's a very complete guide, here's a very simplistic one and here's another one that envolves hacking iTunes library and isn't exactly about just copying.\niTunes is a very messy program and it can easily become hard to keep it clean on just one machine. Transferring it to another machine is adding one more layer of mess.\nAs last resource, try some third party tool, such as syncopation. I haven't tried any myself, but seems very promising and most of them have free trials.\n\nA: Recently dealt with this problem with my parents upgrading from an iPad 2 to an iPad 3.\nThe iPad 2 was synced to one laptop, the iPad 3 was destined for another.  We synced the iPad 3 to a backup of the iPad 2 and then went to plug it into the new laptop.  (NOTE: the new laptop had all files from the old library synced via home share first.)  iTunes asked whether to leave it alone or erase the iPad and sync.  After playing around and much googling we went ahead and tried hitting erase and sync.  When you do this, if the two iTunes libraries have the same iTunes account, it will actually make a full backup of the iPad BEFORE it \"erases and syncs.\"\nOnce it was done, all files were there, even each app's files and settings.  (Such as PDFs saved in good reader).\n\nA: I didn't have any trouble with this when I migrated Macs I copied my iTunes library across manually (iTunes was set to manage the library, so this included everying, apps etc) making sure that the latest iPhone back up was included. I just plugged my iPhone in and it synced as normal.\nObviously make sure you have backed up your iPhone on your old system so that if it doesn't work for you, it can be fixed with a restore on your old system. \n", "Q: Where are Apple's default desktop images stored? When I go to System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver, I see many images in folders such as \"Desktop Pictures\", \"Nature\", \"Plants\", etc. Where are these images located?\nI want to use them in an application such as SpaceSuit to set them as background images for different spaces.\n\nA: As of macOS 12:\n\n*\n\n*Desktop JPEG wallpaper are located in /Library/Desktop Pictures\n\n*Pre-installed dynamic wallpapers (HEIF) are located in /System/Library/Desktop Pictures\n\n*Any dynamic wallpapers downloaded by the user (from the \"Desktop & Screen Saver\" preferences) are located in /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/com.apple.mobileAssetDesktop\n\nA: As of macOS 10.15 (Catalina) the location is /System/Library/Desktop Pictures. I'm unsure what version the location switched.\n\nA: They're in /Library/Desktop Pictures/\n\nA: For future reference: up to macOS 12, you can get macOS to show you the folder by opening System Preferences > Desktop and screensaver then double clicking the folder name on the left where it says Apple > Wallpapers. It will open the folder on Finder (which is on /System/Library/Desktop Pictures).\nI couldn't find a way to get the folder from System Settings on macOS 13 Ventura.\n", "Q: router suggestions Any suggestions on buying a good router for my macbook?? I currently have a trendnet router. the wifi(WPA security) keeps dropping on a regular basis.\ni am contemplating buying a apple airport extreme...but it costs 179$ ..is it worth the money??? \n\nA: You can get the Apple AirPort Express for $100 on Amazon. It's a nice router, with some nifty bonus features like music streaming.\n\nA: The Extreme is an expensive router.  But my experience of it is that once set up correctly, it performs flawlessly until the day it dies (several years).  On the flip side, you may go through several $80 routers in the mean time instead.\n\nA: Unless you're going to use all the features available from the Airport Extreme then it's probably not the best value for money.  You could buy a cheap router which is supported by one of the open source firmware versions which would allow you to 'flash' the firmware and therefore enable options which are normally only available on more expensive products.  \nTake a look at the following three open-source firmware pages for supported routers and have a read about what features they offer and compare to what you need.  \nDD-WRT \nOpenwrt \nTomato \n\nA: Our host, Jeff Atwood, wrote about that here.  I went with the Buffalo one; the stock DD-WRT-based firmware is nice as-is.\n", "Q: iMovie: Crop and letterbox (ignore aspect ratio) I have a project in iMovie and I want to crop part of one of the included clips to a rectangle that isn't 16x9 or 4x3 or any standard aspect ratio. As far as I can see, iMovie will only let me crop in the shape of the current ratio.\nHow can I get iMovie to let me crop part of a clip to a nonstandard aspect ratio and letterbox the result?\n\nA: There is not any reference to custom aspect ratio on iMovie's manual, neither any setting in the project's or crop tool's properties.\nIf custom aspect ratios would supported from iMovie, I believe that Apple would make them easy to find.. \nAfter all, iMovie is a consumer product, and they have excluded such \"advanced\" features in order to get more customers to the Final Cut Suite.\nThe only solution to your problem, would be to crop your footage prior importing to iMovie. \nYou may use free apps such as MPEG Streamclip or VideoMonkey (which is the open-source version of VisualHub).\nAlthough I haven't used any of them for cropping, they do support custom aspect ratios! \nI hope this helps!\n\nA: I came across this page because I had a similar situation and think I have found a solution that worked for me will work for others in the same situation. I was doing a screen capture video and my screen res is 1440x900 (imac). In the video I was making I was doing a tutorial on photoshop and when I opened it up in imovie it only offered 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2. All those aspect ratios would not work for me as it would crop certain tools out of the frame and the viewer would not know what I was clicking on. I chose 16:9 and once I placed the video in the project field I clicked on the small settings box at the beginning of the clip and chose \"Cropping and Rotation\". Over in the viewing window to the left I chose \"Fit\" and it changed the aspect ratio to 1440x900 eliminating the unwanted crop. Hope this is helpful to someone.\n\nA: Yes!  I figured out how to do this. \nThe trick is that you must crop the clip BEFORE you drag it into the timeline.  If you try to crop after the clip is dragged into the timeline at the bottom, you can only used a pre-formatted rectangle size.\nHope this helps somebody!\n\nA: Leaving this for future reference: now you can crop a video from the imported media section before adding it to the movie. \niMovie will add black bars automatically to fit the video, which you can control using the cropping tool on the clip after adding it to the movie.\n\nA: Actually, you set the aspect ratio, or more accurately the video resolution which determines the aspect ratio, when you export your finalized movie.   For instance, I created a video for my Kickstarter.com project (you can see it here: http://kck.st/h0aufg) and I was switching between aspect ratios on export between 4:3 and 16:9.  What you see in iMovie is just the source footage.  It's the export that matters.  You just have to play with the advanced settings for the exported type.\n\nA: The newest iMovie 10.1.9 has a fix.  Select the clip.  Above the viewing window click the crop icon.  Select \"Fit\".  Your clip will revert to the original format.\n\nA: You can crop to any size you like (custom aspect ratio) if you select the video in the 'browser' (the My Media section on the top left panel of iMovie) before importing it to the project (the wide panel at the bottom of iMovie). From there you can zoom in using the chosen aspect ratio\n", "Q: AppleScript - Changing Width of Dialog Box and Adding Text I have a normal display dialog working using AppleScript within the Editor. How would one increase the width of the display dialog and add text under the input field and above the buttons. In advance, thank you for your time.\ndisplay dialog \"EXAMPLE\" with icon alias ((path to me) & \"Contents:Resources:ICON.icns\" as string) default answer (do shell script \"SHELL SCRIPT HERE \" & quoted form of (text returned of (display dialog \"Enter String:\" default answer \"\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"EXAMPLE\"))) buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"EXAMPLE\"\n\n\nA: Regarding \"Changing Width of Dialog Box\", I know of no method to decrease the width of a dialog box.\n\nHow would one increase the width of the display dialog\n\nOne unsophisticated method to increase the width of a dialog does exist.\nA dialog will automatically widen to accommodate the full width of (so as to not truncate) a button title. Consequently, you can add space characters to the button text (spaced out evenly on both ends for a symmetrical appearance) to increase the overall dialog width.\nUsing your sample dialog:\n\n\nIt looks funny to have such a broad button, but this is better than nothing, I suppose.\nUsing this method, you can make an AppleScript dialog as wide as your screen.\nI'd prefer that this trick worked with the dialog title instead. But, if a dialog title exceeds the length of the dialog, the dialog title will simply be cut off, and an ellipsis will be appended. \n\nA: You can't control this with vanilla AppleScript. There may be a plugin/hack that lets you do this, but I haven't found one.\nThe best way to accomplish this is to use Xcode and AppleScriptObjectiveC.\nTutorials and a book on that are available here.\n", "Q: Use hdmi equipped TV/projector as a Mac monitor I have a TV with hdmi inputs, and I have an old Mac Book Pro with DVI output, and I'm going to buy a new Mac Book Pro which has mini DVI output.\nWhen I want to use TV/projector with hdmi inputs as an external monitor, is it just simply connect them with dvi to hdmi connector? \n\n\n*\n\n*If so, what vendors are favored with reasonable price?\n\n*If not, what equipment do I need to connect them? \n\n\nA: New MacBook Pros don't have mini DVI; they have mini DisplayPort. You'll need a mini DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor (third party; Apple don't make one), and it will need to also have an audio connector since mini DisplayPort doesn't include an audio signal.\n\nA: It is that simple.  However your resolution will be 1920 x 1080, so the benefit of a larger than 27\" monitor is minimal at the distances you would typically have a monitor.\n\nA: Yes you just need a mini-DisplayPort to HDMI converter cable for new Macs and a mini-DVI to HDMI converter cable for older MacBooks.  There is no evidence to support that expensive HDMI cables (or DVI cables for that matter) with gold-plated contacts etc. are better than cheap ones.  As long as the cable is built to a reasonable standard where it meets the appropriate safety regulations it should perform flawlessly unless you're buying the cable in lengths of 30 foot or more.  There are plenty of tests out there to support what I'm saying, I've provided an image and link below to explain further.  \n\nhttp://www.40tech.com/2010/05/13/never-buy-expensive-hdmi-cables-buy-lots-of-cheap-ones-and-still-come-out-ahead/\n\nA: Newest Macbooks appear to only come with Thunderbolt, thus no displayport connections.\nEDIT: Thunderbolt accepts Mini Displayport cable connections.\n", "Q: Selecting buttons with keyboard \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I select buttons with just the keyboard? \n\nI have been using OS X for only a while now and am finding certain things a bit hard to do. Consider an option box shown below :-\n\nPressing an enter key would shut down the system, however how do I select the \"restart\" or the \"cancel\" options using they keyboard alone? Whats the keyboard shortcut for that? Arrow keys just dont work.\nComing from a Linux/Windows background, this is really confusing.\n\nA: Use the Tab key to switch buttons then return to activate that. \nI think all GUIs I have used - Windows, OS X, X11, old Mac all have this.\n", "Q: What are the differences between /usr/bin/login and /usr/bin/bash? Terminal.app has a setting to select which shell it uses, and the default setting is \"Default login shell (/usr/bin/login)\".\nWhat are the differences between /usr/bin/login and /usr/bin/bash?\n\nA: Griffo is correct. Now in your scenario, the difference boils down to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you pick /bin/login, then this program will check in the user database what your default shell is and run that shell as a login shell, thereby invoking the rc files that are run only when the shell is run as a login shell (in case of bash those are /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login and , and ~/.profile.\n\n*if you pick /bin/bash, that shell will be executed as a login shell, independently of what shell is set in the user database. This can come in useful when the shell in the user database does not work properly, or you want to be able to use different shells.\n\n\nAs per the comment by Chris Page, the shell is run as a login shell in both cases.\nIf you have not changed your login shell from the default, which is /bin/bash, and you have not changed the rc files of this shell, then the difference will not be noticeable.\n\nA: /usr/bin/login is a program used to login to the system and is not something you invoke manually under normal circumstances.  Have a look at the info/man pages by issuing one of the following commands:\ninfo login or man login \n/usr/bin/bash is a shell and its job is to interpret input from the user and invoke programs.  You can also see more info on bash by using the commands below:  \ninfo bash or man bash\n", "Q: Is it possible to disconnect a bluetooth connection using Applescript? I want to disconnect a connection to a bluetooth device through an Applescript.

It was easy, but annoying to have to pair it again constantly.\nBasically, I am wondering if there is a phone out there that can remain paired with my iPhone while my iPhone is paired with a headset.\n\nA: I have had good experience with Uniden. They make a range of phones that pair to your iPhone via bluetooth.

Movies start, but a few times per movie, returns an error: \"An error occurred while loading this content\".  It will allow me to start it again, but it's really frustrating.    Internet connection seems solid enough- movies in hd start almost instantly, and nothing else on the network hiccups when it occurs.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had this problem with comcast internet. I believe their \"speed boost\" traffic shaping tricked the Apple TV into thinking I had something like a 22 megabit pipe - so the movies started playing instantly. When the boost expired, the data rate was much reduced and eventually the movie played past the delivery of the content which means my overall download wasn't fast enough to get the whole movie to my set before the movie ended.\nWhen I changed internet providers the issues have been resolved for me. I stumbled on this by realizing I never got this error when taking my Apple TV to a friend's house with \"slower\" internet. The confusing part was most of the time - comcast was fast enough - but when it wasn't I still got a great initial \"boost\" but couldn't really watch the rental due to poor bandwidth.\n", "Q: What processes run while my Mac is asleep? What processes, if any, run while my computer is put to sleep (not hibernation mode)?\nFor example, if there's an application which prints a line every second to a file, will it print lines while the computer is asleep? If I have an application running doing video conversion, would it continue its process while the computer is sleeping? If I have an IM application running, will I receive messages while the computer sleeps?\n\nA: Nothing will run while the computer is asleep. Unlike humans, where sleep is different than death, when a computer sleeps it is essentially equal to being powered off. \nThere are a few subtle differences, the primary being that it wakes up faster than from a cold boot. This is because there is enough power supplied to the RAM (memory) to keep it active, but this does not mean there is power supplied to the CPU (heart), or that any processes are active.\nAny processes that are active are below the operating system, in the BIOS of the computer. This is where the \"Wake On Lan\" feature resides, for example.\n", "Q: Pdfs on my iPad to my pc I have downloaded some pdf files I need them for school but would like to read them on my PC at home. how do I get them to my PC. \n\nA: Email might be the most noob-friendly.\n\nA: If you have opened the pdf in ibooks on your iPad then when you sync the iPad they should appear in the books section in iTunes. You may need to turn this section on. From the menu bar click iTunes > Preferences (on a mac) Edit > Preferences - then in the General tab tick the box next to books.\nIt doesn't separate them out into ebooks and pdfs like iBooks does, but if you know what it's called you should be able to find it easy enough.\nIf you need to find in on your hard drive then right click the file and click 'show in finder' (on a mac) - not sure what you'd click on a PC.\nhope that help\n\nA: I would highly recommend Dropbox.

You'll want to have an internal dns server that knows to route *.example.com to your server's internal address and forward everything else to a public dns server like 8.8.8.8, and make sure your dhcp service hands out this dns server.\nIt could also be an ipv6 issue, as Apple products are configured to very strongly prefer ipv6 whenever they can.  If you have partial ipv6 support somewhere on your network (very possible to have without even knowning) it could be confusing the iPad.\n", "Q: How often does Google Notifier check for email? I just installed Google Notifier (Mac), and I noticed that it's a bit delayed in when it reports an email has arrived.\nIt seems that it polls the server every X minutes instead of using push technology. How often does Google Notifier check for mail, and is there any way to modify it?\n\nA: I believe by default it checks every ten minutes.  To adjust the interval, click on the mail icon, then hold down the Command and Option keys and click on Preferences.\nA box will pop up asking for a key and value. Use AutocheckInterval as the key and type the number of minutes in the value box.  Then click Set and you're done.  You need to restart it for the change to take effect.\nNOTE: AutocheckInterval is case-sensitive\nYou can also do the following in Terminal  \ndefaults write com.google.GmailNotifier AutocheckInterval # \nReplace the # above with a number to represent minutes between checks\n\nA: In addition to @Griffo's suggestion of using AutocheckInterval, you can also undo this change by typing the following in terminal:\ndefaults delete com.google.GmailNotifier AutocheckInterval\n\n", "Q: \"System Builder\" Windows on VMWare Fusion? I am a web developer, and I want to buy a copy of Windows 7 to use with my currently-existing copy of VMWare Fusion for easier testing of web sites in Internet Explorer. However, the overabundance of Windows versions is confusing me. I believe I want the Professional version, since from what I understand, the Windows XP emulation feature will let me install IE 6 and 7 for testing alongside 8 and 9. However, Amazon is offering me two versions of Windows 7 Pro; a normal boxed one, and a \"System Builder\" one for half the price. Obviously I'd rather purchase the latter, but I haven't found any clear information as to whether it can legally or technically be used under virtualization or not. Can anyone shed some light on this?\n\nA: The \"System Builder\" version is intended for OEMs.\nBasically, the difference boils down to the fact that microsoft will not provide support (e.g. tech support calls or live-chat) for the OS.\nIt is perfectly legal, will still receive all the patches and service packs, etc...\nHere are more details. It's worth noting that I have transfered OEM versions of Windows XP (though not 7) between multiple computers without any significant issues, and generally if it's not activating, you just call Microsoft and they give you a new code.\nFurthermore, since you're sticking it in a VM anyways, you should never really have to worry about windows thinking you swapped the mobo, and trying to reactivate anyways.\n\nOff-topic a bit, have you tried running Internet Explorer under WINE? I know WINE supports IE6, and you may be able to finangle IE7 or 8 into working as well.\n", "Q: Moving files >4GB from a Mac to a Windows box Normally, when I want to take video files from my Mac to friends who use Windows, I move the files on a FAT32-formatted flash drive or external hard drive, but FAT32 cannot handle files larger than about 4GB.\nI could archive the file into some multi-part format (e.g., RAR) or I could use some not-quite-perfect userspace filesystem drivers (MacFUSE) on the Mac to write to an NTFS-formatted disk, but it seems like there should be a better way.  What other options are there?\n\nA: You have five options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network transfer through FTP or\nSamba directly to a NTFS drive on\nthe windows machine\n\n*External drive with NTFS filesystem, which of course is the\none of the best ways to do it on an\nexternal drive, [edit-add] though you would need some additional software on the Mac's end to be able to write to the NTFS partition. \n\n*Multipart archive, like you said above. \n\n*Use some software on the windows machine to read HFS\npartitions. In the past I've tried\nthe trial of MacDrive and it\nworked quite well, but is paid software. There may be some alternative to it.\n\n*(bonus) Do a hackintosh setup on the windows machine, so you can\nread HFS partitions :)\n\n*(edit-add) With an external harddrive with NTFS partition and a VirtualBox with linux on it. You can then upload the files through virtualbox, as linux supports writing to NTFS partitions through NTFS-3g. This would be the the \"hackiest\" way, but it would come at no money cost, because all of the software is free (virtualbox, linux(easiest is ubuntu))\n\nA: If you are under 10.6.5 or later and Windows Vista or above, you can format your memory stick or usb hard drive to exFAT, a newer version of FAT with large file support and almost unlimited partition size. It has no permissions to speak of so it's perfect to transfer files around.\nOlder systems will not see it however.\nI use this file system on my external 1TB WD hdd and it works beautifully.\n\nA: Y'could use ext3 and then install Ext2Fsd in Windows, though you're still using a userspace filesystem driver in that case (albeit one maybe better than MacFUSE's NTFS driver?)...\n\nA: My solution to this is to partition a drive into two partitions: one for actual data formatted as exFAT and one small partition for variants of exFAT driver for WinXP, latest 10.6.x combo update and 10.5.8 Combo update and Paragon beta exFAT driver for 10.5.8 (I've got it during their beta test and since I've never used don't know if it has any time limit=). And I format that small partition in NTFS under Windows so it will not become corrupted with improper eject like FAT32 usually do.\nProbably I should cover Linux also but I'm not knowledgable about it.\n", "Q: White on black without inverting colors? When using Mac OS X, is there a way to have white text on black background without inverting the other colors? \n\nA: Create a Custom ICC Profile\nTheoretically this is possible by creating a custom ICC profile for your monitor. However, creating an ICC profile is not trivial.\nYou can see this ability by looking at some of the specialised profiles in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/. The Gray Tone profile for example compresses all the colours into a single black to white strip.\n\nThe Lightness Increase profile's 3D representation demonstrates how any colour can be mapped to any other colour.\n\nThere are a number of problems to this approach. Mac OS X's text is anti-aliased. Inverting just black with white will likely result in outlined text; the gray pixels surrounding each letter will not be inverted.\nAn Alterative Approach: Editing System.clr\nAn alternative approach is to alter the colours returned by Apple's NSColor class. This class provides the colours and patterns used across Mac OS X. The file that stores the Developer colours is located at /System/Library/Colors/System.clr.\nLooking at Apple's Color Programming Topics guide, I suspect a developer may be able to load the file into a NSColorList instance, alter the colour, and write back the file.\nThis goes against Apple's advice not to alter files in /System, but it is probably your best solution. The modification task requires someone with Objective-C knowledge and available consulting time.\n\nA: You could turn on both color inverting and grayscale mode in Accessibility preferences - that would give you white-on-black without weird inverted colors, but everything would be grayscale.\n", "Q: How can I leverage multiple iTunes libraries in a LAN to create an office jukebox? Well, we all have Macs, we all have iTunes, and we want to be able to democratically enqueue songs on one of our Macs while being able to choose from everyone's iTunes libraries.\nIs there such a tool?\n\nA: You should be able to do this using shared libraries, which would probably be the easiest way and not cause any problems with permissions or anything like that, however it would probably end up with number of separate libraries rather than just having a one large library.\nUPDATE:\nHaving had a bit of a look into the shared libraries feature it could be a decent option if combined with iTunes DJ - which can be turned on in preferences if currently off.\nEssentially you would require everyone to turn sharing on for their iTunes library (or specific playlists) then have one of your computers acting as a master which has iTunes DJ setup. You can then add tracks from any of the libraries and have requests and votes for next tracks sent via the Remote app for iPhone or just shouted across the office.\nMay still not be quite what you're after, but essentially uses features already available in iTunes rather than a 3rd Party app to do it for you.\n--\nYou could try having one folder for music and all linking to it, but you may hit permission issues or DRM or something silly like that.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1203\nThis tells you how to move the library to a shared folder for one computer to allow multiple users to connect to it, the actual library is still per user, so you may get duplicate files or have to update the library if new files are added. In theory this would allow multiple computers to connect to one collection of music, add to it and play the files others have added. Though my theory is untested and may be flawed (like all good theories).\nOn a different note:\nI was able to have one library (so viewing the same apps, podcasts, music etc. without the need to update it each time you logged in or downloaded new stuff) for multiple users on one computer by copying the whole iTunes folder to the shared folder and then adding an alias to the shared iTunes folder in the Music folder for each users Home folder - which is a bit of a convoluted sentence - which may be of some help, but probably not as the library gets locked when it's accessed by a user, so i can't imagine it'd help for multiple computers. Just another way of doing things.\nHope that helps in some way, let me know id it's absolute guff though.\n\nA: Would MediaRover solve your problem? It creates a shared repository of all your songs, and allows them to be synced, but i don't see why songs couldn't be played from there directly. I'm guessing it might not strictly solve your problem (as i suspect you don't want to have to copy the songs to a new 'library', only enqueue them), but if you want to add them, then it would work.\n", "Q: What's the advantage of buying an iMac over building a Hackintosh? I'm not looking for a flame war or anything like that.\nI am looking at (once I have some money, the hardest part) buying a iMac. Let's just assume one could build a fully working Hackintosh with one's current hardware.\nWhat would be the advantage of buying a new 21\" iMac running the same Mac OS X version vs. building a Hackintosh with better hardware?\nThe chances of me building a Hackintosh is low as I am, well, lazy. :) Just looking for reasons to buy a new iMac.\n\nA: If, as you say, you are \"lazy\", then you will certainly want to go with the iMac.  Building and maintaining a hackintosh is not for the faint of heart.  The first one I built took me over a month of trial and error and scouring google before I had what I would call a \"functioning\" system.\n\nA: The only (as I see it) reasons to build a hackintosh instead of buying an iMac are listed below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cost: A hackintosh with the same specs as an iMac will be substantially cheaper.\n\n*Expandability: Let's see, an iMac lets you change the HDD/SSD, and the RAM. If you're good, you can swap the optical drive for a disk drive or a SATA port. If you build it yourself, you can put whatever you want in it and change it as often as you want. Note: Yeah, you could buy a Mac Pro, but they start at $2500.\n\n*Nerd Cred: Building a computer: +10. Circumventing an operating system and its copy protection: +25.\n\n\nA: Seriously, the most important advantage with Hackintosh will be the knowledge about OS X internal workings which you will get by tinkering with your Hackintosh. \nIf you do not find messing around your Hack to be exciting then I do not recommend to waste time on it.\nAnd do not expect things working 'out of the box' with some \"distribution\".\n\nA: The ability to login to the MAS with your Apple ID and download/install Lion from scratch over the internet without requiring any media/recovery partitions etc, just straight through the EFI firmware.  That will never happen on a hackintosh.\nWe had to wait a year, but finally, a genuine differentiator!\n\nA: I own an 2008 iMac, but just recently built a Hackintosh, running 10.7.3 for my girlfriend who couldn't afford a real Mac. I figured if everything doesn't work right, it's no big deal as it will more than likely be used to surf the web, play on facebook, organize photos, etc. What I found out is, the $400 Hackintosh I built runs circles around my $1400 iMac. Granted my iMac is getting old, but the Hackintosh is posting Geekbench scores around 7500, which is the equivalent of a high end 27\" 2011 iMac for a quarter of the price (my 2008 iMac scored a 3500 by the way). I've (so far) have had no major problems. I also have working HDMI video out and USB3. It did take some setting up, but now that I know what I'm doing I feel I can confidently build a new one in under 2 hrs, that's building it and installing the software. One side note, the $400 does not include an internal HDD, as I used an old one I had laying around the house. Another thing you will have to add to the price is a monitor and a copy of OSX, if you don't have them. So, when you factor in the price of the monitor and HDD, you could easly double your price.\nAlso, the argument of a good warranty with the iMac is flawed, in that I get a better warranty on my individual parts. I believe my motherboard alone gets a three year warranty. Also, I can upgrade my computer to future proof it if I need to. It wouldn't take much (time or money) to upgrade the CPU or graphics card compared to buying a new Mac. \nI'm going to play around a little more with my girlfriends Hackintosh, including running real software on it, like Adobe Creative Suites and see if I encounter any problems with it over the next few months. If everything works out, I think I'll be building one for myself here soon.\n\nA: If your intention of buying a iMac/Hackintosh is to use it for a long term, then go for the iMac (or the Mac Mini/Macbook/Macbook pro with an external monitor). If it is for just playing around, experimenting or learning OSX internals(as @shpokas\n mentioned), or using for a relatively short term, the hackintosh is just fine.\nIf you think the iMac is too expensive for you, then hackintosh is definitely not the way to go, IMHO, I do not see any ROI in the hackintosh.\n\nA: Some things nobody mentioned: warranty, one of the best cases/constructions money can buy both from a funcional and aesthetical point of view, that sudden peace of mind coming from the realization that you don't need drivers anymore.\n\nA: If you get an iMac you will be somewhat future proofing yourself in terms of future software compatibility.  There's no guarantee that something like MacOS X 10.7 will work on your Hackintosh.\n\nA: If you are assuming that you can get (and keep) a hackintosh working properly, the main difference is that the iMac will probably cost you more and looks prettier.  The difference is that getting the hackintosh to work will be a massive pain and if it breaks, no one will fix it for you.  The iMac will work out of the box and Apple will fix it for you when it breaks.  Basically, you pay a bit more money (at least in the 21\" case -- the larger screen iMacs are actually pretty cheap for the screen you get) and save a massive amount of time and worry.\n\nA: One of the unique benefits of buying an iMac is their strong resale value. With a hackintosh, the only practical option would be to sell off the pieces one by one, which is both a larger undertaking and less likely to make you as much money.\n\nA: Another thing to consider is desk space.  The amount of space an iMac occupies is minimal compared to a hackintosh (assuming the hackintosh is a tower).\n\nA: The guy who built the $400 Hackintosh makes some excellent points.  When you break it down, its really unbelievable how much people pay for Apple computers.  There is nothing special in that box!  With an iMac you have an all in 1 with almost zero upgradability.  A smart buyer buys a motherboard with a newer chipset so they can upgrade the CPU/ram/video card easily over the next 2-4 years.  Everything about Apple is just a ripoff.  Another problem with Apple Minis/iMacs and even the Mac Pro:  Temperatures.  They are high.  Apple is incredibly poor at cooling their machines.  You will notice in the new Mac Pro literature there is not one peep about real, measured temperatures.  Nothing.  Because its a cooling disgrace.  Higher temps result in far more hardware failures.  I just cannot fathom how any thinking person would want to support such a company.  \nNow we come to resale value of the Hackintosh:  Is it not going to be worth far more than the parts if it flawlessly runs OS X?  I bet that $400 Hackintosh could be sold for $600!  Strange as it may seem, there are people out there not seduced by Apple style, that value functionality and efficiency, and could care less what a metal box looks like; this is, after all, the center of their informational life.  I used to sell computer parts and the Apple buyers were consistently the most clueless by far as a demographic.  They knew almost nothing about what they should get or why they should get it.  It was quite fascinating to witness over and over.  As a group I believe you could say they were very poor at general analysis (say about 90%).  Sure there were some bright ones but it was very rare.  \nToday you need the following used parts to build your OS X/Windows/Linux computer:\n$50--Motherboard, newer model, full size or smaller ATX, 4 x DDR3 1600mhz ram slots, USB3, built in HDMI/DVI out, 1 or 2 x PCI-Ex16 / 2 x PCI-E / 2-4 PCI slots, from a good manufacturer like Asus, Abit, Gigabyte, MSI or a few others.  \n$40--CPU Here is where you economize a bit as CPUs drastically devalue once they are a year or 2 old.  Use the newest motherboard and an older CPU for maximum value.  Today $40 puts you around 3ghz dual core speed.  Shipping costs for CPUs are almost nothing as they can be stuffed in an envelope.  Insure with U-Pic.com.  Never insure with your shipper!  Never put the description of the item on the outside of the box - just an invitation for theft if its valuable.\n$30--2 x 2gb DDR3 1600mhz ram.\n$15--30gb SSD for your OS and a few programs that need the speed. Or use a mSata if the board has the slot.\n$40--1tb Sata drive for everything else.\n$20--Power supply, around 500 watts.  Without a video card you do not need much power.\n$10--Case\n$205 total.  Get OS X going and you could flip it for $400-500 to someone that sees the inherent problems in something like a Mac Mini.  \nOh the monitor:  Look at the price now!  24inch used ones are going near $100!  But the main thing is you get what you need, not what holy Apple deems you worthy of.  Want a triple monitor setup?  Want a monitor arm?  No problem.  Not so with with the iMac.  No Vesa bolt holes in the back so you are stuck with their idiotic, zero vertical adjustable stand.  All it does is tilt.  \nYou will find that people that know talk in specifics, laying things out in a clear fashion as I hope I have done here.  \nNow ask yourself:  What is the point of using OS X anyway?  Its very substandard to Windows and Linux.  Its a complete mouse centric OS that often ignores keyboard shortcuts vastly slowing down the user.  Its for grandmothers.  Very old grandmothers whose idea of technology is a newer design of candle holder and they got that because of the color.  \nThink and choose well.\n$15--Case\n", "Q: Reading academic papers on the iPhone I frequently want to read academic papers while on the go. They're usually in PDF format, so I sync them to my iPhone with iBooks.\nThe problem is that most of the papers I want to read are in a two-column format that's extremely difficult to read on the phone's screen - I have to zoom in on a column, scroll down, then scroll up to the top of the next column and repeat.\nIs there any software that will \"flatten\" out the PDF? I love Instapaper for web-based information; something that could turn a two-column PDF into a long stream of text and images would be great.\n\nA: Goodreader for the iphone extracts text and images and fits them to your iphone screen and can be customized to your liking.\n\nA: Calibre can be used to manage eBook libraries including PDF, and has the tools to transform them to other formats, including re-flow of text.\n\nA: For academic papers I would recommend Papers by Mekentosj.\nThe app is available for iOS and Mac, so you can read, annotate or mark your papers on the go and have all papers in sync with your Mac. At home you can easily work with your papers, because Papers is also reference management software and gives the ability to directly search within your papers and cite within Word, Pages and several other editors.\nI have the iOS and the Mac app and I love it.\n\nA: I agree heartily with the answers about GoodReader and (somewhat less heartily) Calibre.  This is not the answer you’re looking for, but for academic articles, especially with LaTeX’s wide margins, my iPad is much, much better than my iPhone—usually the entire non-empty part of the page can fit onscreen in portrait mode.  (For everything else I use landscape mode.)  For reviewing my own LaTeX articles, GoodReader is much better than iBooks, since you can annotate.  One gotcha:  Apple’s Preview doesn’t display all annotations, so I (reluctantly) use Adobe for this.\n", "Q: How can I tell if a QuickTime movie is prepared for streaming? I have been given a QuickTime file to place on a web site for my client. I requested the file be prepared for streaming using \"Fast Start - Compressed Header\" so that the video with start to play as soon as QuickTime player has buffered enough. (We will not be using a QuickTime Streaming Server for this video)\nI am unsure if the file provided to me meets my request. For one, it seems to be am MPEG4 file, not an MPEG4 video file wrapped in a QuickTime .mov container. But even when I export a short ~10 second clip using \"fast Start - Compressed Header\" and open that in QuickTime player, nothing I can see under Movie Properties or Movie Information shows me that I have added a fast start header.\nHow can I determine if a QuickTime movie file is prepared for streaming using Fast Start, Compressed Header?\n\nA: You may want to try QTIndexSwapper by Renaun Erickson. It's an Adobe AIR app that detects if a movie is ready for web and if not it tries to move the index (header) to the beginning of the file thus allowing a simultaneous download and playback.\n", "Q: Issue with floating windows and Spaces This problem has been bothering me since I switch to Snow Leopard.  When I use applications that have some floating windows (Maya 2011, Adobe After Effects), Spaces seems to bring the floating windows along for the ride.  The main application window stays in it's appropriate space.  When using an app like Maya, this could be 5-10 windows.  A workaround is to click the desktop twice and then jump to a new space, but that is getting old. This was never a problem in Leopard. \nThanks,\nMark\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't think there is a general solution to this problem. I think each application can behave slightly differently with spaces - either by design, or because the developers haven't configured things properly.\nThis thread suggests that an earlier version of Maya works better with spaces, for example, while others report that the current version works fine.\nHowever, from my experience with different applications on Leopard, Snow Leopard and Lion, each application can behave differently. I also know that (at least prior to Lion), developers could instruct different windows to do different things when switching spaces.\nMy best recommendation would be to contact the developers of these applications, and suggest a better way of handling certain windows. You should also check through the application's preferences beforehand, as some applications may allow you to customise the behaviour.\n", "Q: I cannot connect to my workplace VPN My workplace has VPN and it works great for me in Parallels Windows XP and Bootcamp Windows Vista. However, with the same config, I can't get it to work in Snow Leopard. I don't know what type of server they are using, but PPTP works for Windows. Any ideas why it may work for Windows and not OS X?\nUpdate: I should also mention that at one point it did work. I couldn't tell you if anything changed at the server between when it did work and when it stopped.\nMore information: I can connect just fine, but I can't access any resources. I try to ping a known internal IP address and the destination can't be reached.\n\nA: I've had trouble with VPN before on my setup. I fixed my problem, but I had to do a couple of weird things first. Could you tell me more about your settings?\nUnder System > Preferences > Advanced... \n\n\n*\n\n*Under (tab) DNS > DNS Servers: Do you have your DNS servers set?\na. If so, are they something like 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.4?\n   You may need to change your home router's IP address if so.\n\n*Under (tab) DNS > Search Domains: do you have a search domain set?\nie. domain.local\nI hope changing those settings helps. If not let me know and I'll try to help. VPN has been enormously frustrating for me in the past.\n\nA: In my experience, this is usually due to authentication or encryption.  Double-check your settings.  Also I wonder if the server may be on an encryption scheme unsupported by OS X.\n\nA: @Am1rr3zA Had the answer in this case, though I have tried this in the past and have had it fail. \n", "Q: Graphical Ping Plotter, similar to Perfgraph? On Windows, I use a program called Perfgraph, which, among other things, showed a visual graph of ping latency to various hosts in my Task bar. Here's an example:\n\nThe ping metric is the graph on the far right.\nDoes anyone know if something like this is available for OS X? I use it to ping my router and my DNS name server so that I always have a graphical indicator on my connection quality, and if there are problems I know if the source is inside or outside my router.\nSo far, the only \"alternative\" is the CLI ping command, which just doesn't present the information in as easily digestible format as Perfgraph.\nI don't need all the other functions of Perfgraph, I just want that ping plotter!\nThanks all!\n\nA: I have a nice CLI solution - it's called mtr.

It works only with one host, but should work for you.\n", "Q: Share the clipboards automatically when using Apple Screen Sharing? Is it possible to share the clipboard of my local machine and a remote machine automatically when using OS X's built-in Screen Sharing utility? The whole Edit -> Send Clipboard, Edit -> Get Clipboard routine starts to feel a little cumbersome if you're doing any regular copy and paste work between your local desktop and a remote session.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the clipboard can be shared automatically. However, instead of going Edit->Send Clipboard and Edit->Get Clipboard, you can use the get/send clipboard buttons:\n\nThey're usually hidden by default, but you can get them to appear by clicking this button in the upper right hand corner of the window:\n or going View->Show Toolbar\n\nA: This feature seems to now exist in Apple Screen Sharing Version 1.5 (481.1)\nEdit > Use Shared Clipboard\nOr View > Show Toolbar and then select Use Shared Clipboard\n\n\nA: Maybe you might want to switch to JollysFastVNC, which supports pasteboard sync out of the box: http://www.jinx.de/JollysFastVNC.html\nNote that it is not free of charge.\nYou can also get it in the Mac App Store, where the home version (up to 7 computers) costs US-$ 9.99.\n", "Q: What control character do I send to the terminal to make it delete a full word at a time? I recently discovered that sending \\033[5D and \\033[5C sends the character to move a full word at a time, making mac os x terminal almost as awesome as the default ubuntu and debian terminals. \nSo then, the one thing I'm missing is: the control key to bind option-delete and option-backspace to deletion of full words. \n\nA: ctrl+W will delete the previous word.\n\nA: *\n\n*Select \"Preferences...\" from the Menu \"Terminal\"\n\n*go into \"Settings\" and select your default window configuration, go into the tab \"Keyboard\"\n\n*Have a look at all keybindings, (eg. forward delete is bound to \\033[3~ ) and note you can change them by double clicking (thats easier to use than bind in your ~/.bash_profile). \n\n\nIf you choose to use ⌥ as meta-key, ⌥+backspace will work immediately, though this setup might break special characters you can only input by pressing ⌥ together with them (depending on your keyboard layout).

I noticed that Safari has an Extensions Gallery page. I'm wondering how I would search all the extensions to find the one I want.\nDoes that page list all of the extensions available, meaning I should use Edit > Find...? Or are there many more which aren't listed on the page?\n\nA: There are many extensions not listed on Apple's page. However, if they're not on the main page, they're not on Apple's site at all. Your cmd-f solutions is the best option if you want to search just the extensions that Apple has listed.\nIf you want to broaden your search to more of the extensions available, turn to third-party sites: http://safariextensions.org/, http://safariextensions.tumblr.com/, and http://www.pimpmysafari.com/category/extensions are all good, more-comprehensive lists.\n\nA: The Missing Safari Extensions Gallery Search Engine is hosted at hakore.com now. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be operative enough to give any search results any longer. Meanwhile Apple has added a rudimentary search to the extension gallery page that at least works and gives some results. This only works for extensions listed by Apple.

I would like to backup my data to two external drives. That way I would like this to work is that both disks should have have a full backup of my internal disk. Is this the way TimeMachine would work?\n\nA: I haven't tried it, but since mountain lion, it just works.\n\nA: I don't think time machine will backup to two separate disks simultaneously, but I can give you my backup solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine to external drive. Easy and I don't ever have to think about it. Just plug it in and BOOM! backup. \n\n*Second, bootable backup to a second external drive using CarbonCopyCloner. This one runs on a schedule and it's a free program. \n\n*Dropbox. I have the 50gb account, and I store all of my current projects, important documents, and anything else i may need at any time, whether I'm in front of my Mac or not. Using the Dropbox iPhone and iPad apps along with the web interface, I can always get to important files when I need to.\n\n*Finally, I use Arq to backup a copy of my library folder to an Amazon S3 bucket. This one is a paid app, but worth it because I'm paranoid and it makes me feel comfortable that even if both of my backup drives fail, between the S3 Library backup and my documents on Dropbox, I can recover from a disaster quickly and with minimal hassle. \n\nA: You might consider 1 Time Machine disk and 1 disk that is using CrashPlan. The CrashPlan disk can be offsite too.\n\nA: This has always worked well to cycle drives in to back up your files to more than one place. Mountain Lion can now track two drives at once, so you don't need to keep setting up a new preference, but I have used this for several machines since day one with Time Machine.\nBefore Mountain Lion, you needed to enter the Time Machine preference pane and select each drive as you connected the new drive to break the expectation that the system should back up to a drive that's now not mounted.\nI have seen this work well for using multiple drives and cycling them manually for weekly, monthly and more sparse rotation schedules including if you place a drive off-site or keep one drive mostly in a fire safe (in a waterproof container) for enhanced protection in case of a fire (and/or flood).\nWith Mountain Lion, you can tell the system to alternate between two drives so a simple A/B rotation means you can set it and forget it. If both drives are connected, each backup will alternate between drives, but if only one drive is connected, all backups will go to that drive. When you reconnect a drive that has missed several backups, it's only an hour or two away from being updates.\nOf course - you now have two (or more) locations to find any one instance of a file, but again, the longer a file lives - the higher chance it's on both drives. Files you download and delete could only get backed up to one drive, but if a file sits on your mac long enough to get saved to both drives, you'll have at least two copies of it should you delete it and need a recovery later.\n", "Q: Sync used iPhone for first time My wife received an 3G iPhone from her sister after her sister bought a newer version.  My wife has already had the iPhone switched over to her AT&T account but has not synced it with a computer.\nI am PC guy and don't know much about Macs in general.\nFirst I want to know how to sync it for the first time. She does not care about any music/pictures/apps etc. What is most important are the contact/addresses/phone numbers. \nFurther. I want her to be able to sync with her laptop on a regular basis but I want to be able to restore from my computer in case her laptop gets stolen/destroyed/corrupted.\nHer laptop is a Windows 7 and my computer is also a Windows 7.\nThe first time I tried to sync I received an ominous warning about all data being removed or something to that effect. So what is the best way to go about this?\n\nA: The data being deleted is in reference to the data already stored on the phone (e.g. the sister's contacts). An iPhone can only be synced to one PC at a time, and if you want to setup syncing with this new PC, you will need to delete all of the data on the iPhone.\nIf your wife wants her sister's contacts, then she shouldn't sync and wipe the data before she has a copy of all that info. One way to to get the info on to the iPhone is to sync it with outlook (via iTunes) on the sister's PC. Then export the contact's from Outlook, copy the file to the wife's PC, import into Outlook. Then proceed ahead with the sync that will wipe all the data, and set it up to sync with Outlook. This way your wife will have all the original contacts.\nIf your wife does not care about her sister's contacts, then you can go ahead with the initial sync that wipes all the data.\nWhen the phone is synced with Windows 7, it will use the following folder for backups: \\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\. Therefore, you should back up that folder if you want to keep a second copy on your computer.\nIf the most important data that will be used on the phone is Contact information, I would recommend that instead of using Outlook, that your wife use Google Sync. This will allow her to store all of her contacts in Gmail, such that if anything happens to the phone, the contact info can easily be accessed again online, all without ever having to sync or backup (or double backup) the phone. Google Sync can also sync your Calendar. If you setup a Google account as IMAP, you could even have the Notes synced to the cloud as well.\nKeep in mind that when the data gets wiped, everything on the phone will be deleted. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Music\n  \n*Videos\n  \n*Podcasts\n  \n*Address Book and Address Book favorites.\n  \n*App Store Applications and their data.\n  \n*Application settings, preferences, and data.\n  \n*Autofill for webpages.\n  \n*CalDAV and subscribed calendar accounts.\n  \n*Calendar accounts.\n  \n*Calendar events.\n  \n*Call history.\n  \n*Camera Roll (Photos, screenshots, images saved, and videos taken.)\n  \n*In-app purchases.\n  \n*Keychain (this includes email account passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, and passwords you enter into websites and some other applications.)\n  \n*List of External Sync Sources (Mobile Me, Exchange ActiveSync).\n  \n*Location service preferences for apps and websites you have allowed to use your location.\n  \n*Mail accounts.\n  \n*Managed Configurations/Profiles.\n  \n*Microsoft Exchange account configurations.\n  \n*Network settings (saved wifi spots, VPN settings, network preferences).\n  \n*Nike + iPod saved workouts and settings.\n  \n*Notes.\n  \n*Offline web application cache/database.\n  \n*Paired Bluetooth devices.\n  \n*Safari bookmarks, cookies, history, offline data, and currently open pages.\n  \n*Saved suggestion corrections.\n  \n*SMS and MMS (pictures and video) messages.\n  \n*Trusted hosts that have certificates that cannot be verified.\n  \n*Voice memos.\n  \n*Voicemail token.\n  \n*Wallpapers.\n  \n*Web clips.\n  \n*YouTube bookmarks and history.\n  \n\n(This list was slightly modified from Apple's page)\n", "Q: Best approach for enterprise integration I found information from Apple regarding managing a business with a large number of iPhones and iPads. It looks to me like Apple just builds the libraries, and expects vendors to build applications that actually manage these devices. Of course all of the options that Apple mentions are the typical \"call us for a price\" places.\nAny advice on a simple way to manage iPhones within an enterprise? Recommendations on reasonably priced software? I want to do the standard stuff. Deploy applications, create restrictions, etc.\nJust looking for someone with experience that can point me in the right direction.\n\nA: While Apple puts their iOS Enterprise Deployment documentation in their developer area, it doesn't mean that you need custom software to handle iPhones and iPads. It's all pretty much what I think of as standard sysadmin-type work, so while it does require some knowledge of XML files and scripting, it's fairly well documented.\nHere are some places to start:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone Configuration Utility \n\n*Distributing Enterprise Apps for iOS 4 Devices\n\n*Over-the-Air Profile Delivery and Configuration\n\n*iPhone Configuration Profile Key Reference\n\nA: With more and more companies deciding to go with iPhones and iPads, enterprise deployment of iOS devices is becoming a new focus Apple. In my mind, it's broken up into two segments. \nThe process Dori outlined is 100% end user driven. You can setup the architecture to have end users navigate to iPCU generated Configuration Profiles via Apache, which will then prompt the user to install them. The same with OTA Application installations. But at the end of the day, you have to either A) Get the user to follow you instructions or B) Do it all by hand. And even then the end user can just go and remove the profile at their will. This is fine for things like VPN and Exchange where the end users want the profile. But if it's something like a passcode or a restriction on App Store content, then you don't have a great way to keep it on the device.\nOption B is something called MDM. That's what you were referring to in the beginning. And yes, the last time I check there is absolutely nothing on Apple's developer portal about it. But if you have access to last years WWDC session you can catch a demo of it. It allows for over the air management of iOS devices. Things like the ability to push configuration profiles to devices. But since Apple's not telling anyone how to do this, it looks like you'll have to rely on a vendor for it. Check out a quick  Google search  for some examples.\nSo my take is if you're cool with everything be end user initiated, go with A. But if you need to enforce things, I think your only option is B.\n", "Q: Look Up in Dictionary with \"All\" filter I like the fact that I can launch the dictionary app by highlighting a word in any any application and then going to (Application Name) > Services > Look Up in Dictionary.\nHowever, this selects the Dictionary filter (instead of All, Thesaurus, Apple, or Wikipedia). I would prefer if it selected the All filter instead. Is there any way to create such a global menu item/shortcut which would do the same thing as lookup in dictionary but have it select the All filter instead of the Dictionary filter?\n\nA: The only way I could get this to work is by creating a new service that looks up the word and than tells Dictionary.app to use the \"all\" filter.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /Applications/Automator.app and select the services template\n\n*in the top right part of the screen, you should see that the default input parameters Automator has selected (\"Service receives selected text in any application\") is just what you want\n\n*in the left hand search field, search for an Action called \"Run Applescript\" and drag it into your workflow\n\n*replace the part \"(* Your script goes here *)\" with the following Applescript, and than choose File->Save.

The problem is that all my old voice memos aren't added to my iTunes library, but they're still on the iPhone. \nSo I wonder how do fix so I can get all my voice memos to sync with iTunes?\n\nA: Voice memo's didn't sync like music with older versions of iTunes. With any current version of iTunes it should sync properly.\nI doubt that this question is still active, but for future problems I've added an answer.\n", "Q: How do I convert a suitcase font? I have a font set - Type: Font Suitcase\nI am sure I have used a terminal command to convert it to a TTF or OTF. I don't really want to pay for software to do so. What is the best way of converting these types of font?\n\nA: Font Suitcases can potentially hold 2 different kinds of fonts: bitmap fonts and TrueType fonts. Normally, font suitcases that hold bitmap font data are only one half of the font; to be usable you need to have the additional PostScript Outline font files (these will have an LWFN icon).\nOtherwise, the font suitcase can represent a TrueType font, which compared to a \"PostScript Type 1 Font Suitcase\", is truly self-contained.\nI'm not aware of command-line font converters for the Mac. The only type of conversion I could imagine using command line tools would be converting from a resource-fork-based Font Suitcase to a Datafork TrueType font (.dfont), and possibly from a Mac TrueType to a Windows TrueType font (basically you'd need to extract the 'sfnt' resource entries).\nTo try to figure out if the Mac Font Suitcase is a TrueType font, you can use the following command:\ngrep -c sfnt /Library/Fonts/BankGothic/..namedfork/rsrc\n\nWhat this does is return the number of times 'sfnt' is found in the resource fork of the file in question. If this returns 0, the file is most likely not a TrueType font.\nNote that by default, terminal command will only act on the data fork part of files. For example:\nls -la /Library/Fonts/BankGothic\n-rw-rw-r--@ 1 root  admin  0 Mar  7  2007 /Library/Fonts/BankGothic\n\nThis shows that the file is empty (has a file size of 0). To specifically target the resource fork, you append /..namedfork/rsrc to the filename as in the following example:\nls -la /Library/Fonts/BankGothic/..namedfork/rsrc\n-rw-rw-r--  1 root  admin  346937 Mar  7  2007 /Library/Fonts/BankGothic/..namedfork/rsrc\n\nEDIT:\nIf it is a Mac TrueType font, I can convert it to one or more Windows TrueType fonts (.ttf) for you. (For this particular type of conversion, there's no need to use font software; a simple Mac resource editor (and knowledge of this process) should be sufficient. If I do convert it in this manner, I'll provide screenshots of what I'm doing for the record).\nEDIT 2: See my answer on StackOverflow for \"Using OS 9 resource fork fonts with CSS\" for a tool I wrote that would allow drag and drop extracting of sfnt resource entries to individual ttf font files.\n\nA: Font Suitcases can also contain PostScript Type 1 outline fonts. The current highest voted answer above does not mention this. And the solution proposed there does not work for these types of suitcases.\nHere is a screenshot of what a Type 1 suitcase looks like in OS X:\n\nThe steps for converting these to OpenType OTF are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install FontForge as per http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/downloads/mac/.\n\n*With each suitcase file, you will find one or more font data files that are part of the suitcase set — usually with a similar name; these are the files you need to open. For example, the suitcase might be named \"Gadzooks Family\" and Finder will show its type as \"font suitcase\"; and with it you might see files called GadzooIta and GadzooMed (the italic and medium styles) which have the Finder type of \"PostScript® Type 1 outline font\". There is no standard naming convention, unfortunately, but it should be pretty obvious.\n\n*Open one of the PostScript outline font files. FontForge will probably not show the file, since typically they do not have a file extension. Set the file filter in the Open dialog to show all files. This should allow you to open the font. If it worked, you should see a grid of all the font characters.\n\n*Import the kerning data. Go to File > Merge Feature Info… in the menu, and choose the file that is the font suitcase. You should then be prompted with a list of data sources within the suitcase, and you need to choose the corresponding font data from the list. Unfortunately this is more art than science, but the font data should have a name similar to the name of the font style you are editing.\n\n*To verify that the kerning data was imported, choose Metrics > New Metrics Window from the menu, and then in the bar at the top type a couple characters that should have a kerning setting (such as “AV” or “WA” — these are likely suspects, but every font is different), and you should see a value in the Kern box below (for example, maybe \"–20\"). \n\n*Save if you want, using FontForge native .sfd format.\n\n*Choose the File > Generate Fonts… menu command to export the font in the format desired. I got a bunch of warnings when I did this, but it still worked.\n\n\n*When using this method, I found that a few kerning pairs were lost. I don't know why, but it was usually the same several kerning pairs in each font that went missing. Out of 30-100 kerning pairs per font, maybe 3-5 would be missing. But these can be restored manually. Using the commercial font management app FontExplorerX Pro, for example, you can see all the kerning pairs in a font and their values. You can then manually enter any missing values in FontForge's metrics window before exporting the font.\n\nA: Try Fondu:\n\nA set of programs to interconvert between mac font formats and pfb, ttf, otf and bdf files on unix. Fondu will read a series of mac files, check their resource forks and extract all font related items into seperate files.\n\n", "Q: How can I clean up 'Other' storage on iPhone 3G? My iPhone 3G is currently showing 3.1GB of 'Other' disk space in iTunes, and this amount seems to be growing by about 0.1GB every couple of days.  I can't find any good references for what this space could actually be getting used for.  \nI've heard of doing a restore to clear it up, which works, for about a day, but then the 'Other' space starts to quickly accumulate again.\nI've also done all the Internet history clearing, turning off of indexing and removing of disabled mail accounts, still no success.  I'd love to know how to either clear this stuff up, or see a decent explanation for why my phone is using all this extra space.\nHere's a snapshot of what my disk usage bar in iTunes looks like:\n\nUPDATE: My phone is not jailbroken.  It is stock IOS 4.2.1.\n\nA: If you are jailbroken you could use iFile (not free, but worth the $4) from Cydia to find out how much space is used by which folder on your iPhone.\nIn iFile press the blue arrow after each folder and take a look at Size under Attributes. Do this for all the folders and sub-folders until you can zero in on what uses up the space on your device.\n\nA: I had this same exact problem until 2 days ago followed the procedure outlined on this page: http://www.ipodrepublic.com/iphone/fixing-issue-other-files-iphone-memory/2010/03/31/ and it worked well.  Re-created below.  I haven't seen my Other size grow since.\nStep 1: Turn of sync music in iTunes\nWhen you have synced your iPhone and noticed that “other files” have taken up a lot of storage space on the iPhone, un-tick the “sync music” alternative in iTunes before un-connecting your iPhone.\nStep 2: Install DiskAid software on computer/mac  (Instead of using DiskAid (paid), I used iPhone Explorer (which is free.))\nDiskAid is a neat little software that allows you transfer files to your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, treating it as a USB drive. They offer a free trial of the software so no need to purchase it first time you have to use it at least.\nMake sure your iPhone is connected with the USB when you open up DiskAid. When the program is running, at the bottom left corner it says “DiskAid folder”, click on the drop down list and choose “media folders”.\nStep 3: Go into iTunes Control folder and then the Music folder\nIn DiskAid you will see an overview of all the folders and files on your iPhone. Go to the iTunes Control Folder and then the subfolder called Music. Under the Music folder you will likely see a lot of subfolders starting with “f”.\nStep 4: Delete/remove all subfolders in Music\nDelete all the subfolders under the Music folder. They include the files that are hogging your iPhone memory under “other files”.\nStep 5: Open iTunes and sync your iPhone\nWith “music sync” still turned off in iTunes, sync your iPhone. This will remove all music files from your iPhone, but keep all other content. Don’t worry about this though, as in the next steps you will sync the music back onto your iPhone.\nStep 6: Unplug iPhone and reboot it\nOnce the iPhone has finished syncing, unplug it and perform a reboot. The reboot is done by holding down the “power down” button at the top right at the same times as holding down the control button. Hold both of them until the iPhone has switched off and the Apple logo appears on the screen before releasing both buttons. This action will reboot your iPhone.\nStep 7: Reconnect your iPhone to iTunes and recheck “sync music”\nThis will put your music back onto the iPhone, and you should not see any of the “other files” taking up any of the iPhone memory. Once the sync is complete your iPhone should be all sorted again.\nIf you still see “other files” taking up memory on your iPhone you have likely done something wrong or left out subfolders in step 4.\nAlso, delete the same type of sub-folders in the PWNTunes Itunes Control folder as well if you are jailbroken and have PWNTunes installed.\n\nA: See here for a similar question. Most likely the \"Other\" is your jailbreak (Cydia or other)... are you jailbroken?\nIf not, the other ideas found there are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete Contacts\n\n*Delete Notes\n\n*Delete Calendar Events\n\n*Delete Saved E-Mails\n\n*Delete Old Texts\n\n\nA: Apart from bookmarks, calendars, contacts, emails, and notes, I noticed that the \"yellow\" bar increased after I updated to a newer iOS version.\nIn the first case, it's easy to decrease the memory usage by removing the items that are not necessary (starting from email messages); for the last case, I don't really know how to free the memory.\nI don't have much memory taken for other items; it's probable that in your case, the memory is used for email messages, contacts, calendars, or notes.\n\n\nA: Click Reset Warnings on your device's icon in iTunes, then Sync.  This will allow you to see if you have a bunch of apps crashing and leaving crash logs behind.\n\nA: Any app that stores information- Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Dropbox, VLC, Goodreader, etc...- stores those files in \"other\". If you have opened attachments (documents, PDFs, etc...) in your Mail app, those are also stored in \"other\" for a short time. Next time you sync your iPhone, check under the \"Apps\" tab way down at the bottom in the \"File Sharing\" section. If you have a bunch of apps that have documents in that area and you aren't using the documents, clean them off and see how much smaller your \"other\" is.\n\nA: I tried some of the solutions here, but nothing worked. So here's what almost worked for me. I have 5.5GB of 'other' that wouldn't go away.\nSo i connected my iphone to my ubuntu box (10.10) and was able to browse through the folders. By right-clicking each folder and selecting 'properties', i was able to pin down the offending Safari folder, and the file 'goog-phish-shavar.db' within. I couldn't find much info about this file, but it appears to be a sqlite db of domains, possibly for the purposes of fraud control (anti-phishing).\nI deleted the file, then re-synced, but found the 5.5 GB still there. So I rebooted, still there. Turned off Fraud warnings, resynced, still there. Rebooted, resynced... still freakin' there! plugged back into ubuntu, found and redeleted, rebooted, verified it was really, really gone in ubuntu.. reconnected and what do you know - it's back again! I can't seem to get rid of it. but at least i know what's taking up all the space. I'll post back here if I can figure out how to get rid of it once and for all. \n\nA: If your phone is not jailbroken, then the only remaining option may be doing a Factory Reset, and set up the phone As a new phone, not from a backup.  My Other data appeared to be backup related.  This is what I had to do after trying just about every other option mentioned. \nBefore you do a Factory Reset, do the following first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transfer your iTunes purchases. Make sure all your apps, books and music from your phone are on your computer. Also that your computer is Authorized to play those purchases so they can be reloaded.\n\n*Back up your photos. I sync with iPhoto, but if you use Photo Stream, make sure to backup your cloud data.\n\n*Sync your notes, contacts and such to the cloud. When I did the reset, I lost my daughters notes, but her contacts were still in the phone. I think this was because I did not have notes synced with the cloud.\n\n\nFactory Reset\n\n\n*\n\n*After performing these steps, go to the Summary tab and click\n\"Restore iPhone\"\n\n*Instead of choosing from backup, select \"As new phone\".\n\n*After the setup completes, you can begin adding back your apps,\nmusic and photos. \n\n", "Q: Is there a way to reduce the swappiness of OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard? I have 6GB on my old Macbook, with an SSD.  I would like to avoid writing to the swap file as much as possible.  Ever since my upgrade, I have always had at least 1 to 1.5GB memory \"free\".  Yet, I have always had 2 to 25MB of used swap space.  (Out of 128MB total)  How do I get this to be 0MB swap used unless I run out of \"free\" memory?\nOn Linux, there is now a \"swappiness\" parameter that controls the tendency to use swap.  I'd like to crank OS X's \"swappiness\" down very very low, but not deactivate swap entirely.  I'd like to know that my machine will just run slower if it ever runs out of memory instead of having a kernel panic.  I'm pretty close to where I want to be, but I'd like to get rid of these writes to a large file that (slightly) shorten the life of my SSD while doing me no benefit whatsoever.  \n\nA: I'm not sure that a swap file of 2MB to 25MB is really something to worry about. It might be more useful to look at the values for Page In and Page Out to determine how often data is being written to the swap. The number of page events can be found using the System Memory tab of the Activity Monitor application.\nThere are a couple of other options that you could try but I think you're probably way out of warranty if you try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling dynamic pager\n\n*Creating a new paging system\nI would just suggest putting up with the existing system since the wear on your SSD is probably minimal especially since SSD wear is a bit of a myth anyway or maybe it's not.\n\nA: For temporary solution, you can run sudo purge to force disk cache to be flushed and emptied which may reduce the swappiness a bit (if you had several large swap files in /private/var/vm, e.g. I've got 17G of them at the time of writing). If won't work, remove the files manually, they would be recreated.\nYou can also disable dynamic pager (swap daemon), so run in Terminal (restart is required):\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nTo re-enable:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nUnfortunately in the latest OS X you've to also disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) which is actually not recommended. See: How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA \"rootless\" on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?\n", "Q: What's the most complete calendar app for iPhone? I (and I think many of you) would like to find an iPhone calendar app that lets the user add an new event by touching the hour (no the day-view mode) and delay an event, instead of needing to enter, edit, change the time and finally save.\nIs there such an app? \n\nA: I'm a big fan of Calvetica, which can do the things you're looking for. And it's much prettier than the default iOS Calendar app.\n\nA: Pocket Informant is probably the most full featured I've seen - almost too full-featured, as it can be a bit overwhelming initially.  I use it's built in Google Sync functionality to sync directly to my Google Calendars from within the app itself.\nBonus points for the fact that it actually turns the location field of an event into a map link (Still can't understand why the built-in Calendar.app doesn't do this...)\n", "Q: Is there an xkeymacs equivalent in Mac? In PC, the utility of xkeymacs.exe enables one to use emacs key in every case. Does Mac have the similar utility? For example, is there a utility that I can use key 'C-x C-s' to send the key 'Command-S'?\n\nA: You could configure some of them in ~/Library/Keybindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict. See hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/cocoa-text.html and this sample file: Emacs Opt Bindings.dict.\nAnother option would be to use KeyRemap4MacBook. It supports over 1000 preconfigured keybindings, including an \"Emacs Mode\" section.\n\nA: Edit: It looks like there is a solution described here.\n\nI don't know of a solution, but I'd bet if anything could do this, it would be Ukelele.\n\nUkelele can assign multiple-character\n  strings and can create \"dead keys\",\n  where a keystroke sets a new state\n  that modifies the output of the\n  following keystroke.\n\nPossibly combined with an Automator app. The initial keystroke C-x initiates the app, it captures the secondary keystroke (C-s), uses a lookup table to convert C-s to CMD+s, and then passes that to the foreground app.\n\nA: I don't know xkeymap, but it sounds like you want to do keyboard mapping.

It has XSD validation, autocompletion towards this schema. Also, it offers a graphical XSD designer.\n\nA: IntelliJ IDEA is overall a good IDE, it's available on Mac, and it supports editing XML in ways such as syntax highlighting, collapsing a given scope, and validating XML. I haven't used it much for XML, but I've had good experiences with that IDE for other purposes so thought I would mention it here.\n\nA: And of course Emacs with psgml-mode or nxml-mode will edit XML.\n\nA: Testing this and that, I settled down with Text Wrangler, with XML Tidy script. It's free and pretty useful for my purposes. \n\nA: OS X Software for Editing XML\n\n\n*\n\n*EditX (commercial)\n\n*oXygen (commercial)\n\n*XML Edita (commercial)\n\n*XMLMate (free/open source\nplugin) for TextMate (shareware)\n\n*XMPlify (commercial)\n\n\nA: If you have the Apple Developer Tools installed, then you have Xcode and this includes the \"Property List Editor\" application (Apple plist files are in XML format, hence the name).\nYou can find the application here:\n/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Property List Editor.app\n\n\nA: I found a simple and free software to view, no editor: XML Spy\n\nA: TextMate.\nYou can download the source code from GitHub and compile it locally. Then in the preferences install the appropriate language bundle. https://github.com/textmate/textmate\nIf you like the application I would recommend buying the commercial version to show your support to the author.\n\nA: As an alternative to XMLmind XML Editor there's QXmlEdit It is also free and quite feature rich. It's written in Qt and runs on Mac as well as the other platforms Qt supports.\n\nA: I always believe that an open source is the best and simple solutions. You can try BlueFish, or Brackets, I strongly advise you to try it, you won't lose anything. \n\nA: I'm looking for the same thing, and I just came across XMLmind XML Editor. I like how it can load my files pretty quickly.\n@rds: I've tried using Eclipse to open my XML files, but it would hang with my files (>15MB).  I've come to notice any editor built with Java hangs upon trying to open my file, or at least takes an unbearably long time to load it.\n\nA: I like the look of http://www.sublimetext.com/2\nas seen in a Daniel Shiffman tutorial\n\nA: Another option is Microsoft VS Code with an XML extension...\nI'm using:\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DotJoshJohnson.xml\nYou can Cmd+Shift+P and type \"XML\" to find the utils provided by the extension.\nSome keyboard shortcuts are provided, e.g. Ctrl+Shift+Alt+B to format nicely.\nOr find elements by XPath query, or display the XPath of the highlighted element.\n\nA: You can try all in one JSON viewer or all in one XML viewer.\n\n", "Q: I have to turn off and on my WiFi every hour or so. What's wrong? In my home network, my Apple TV, iPad, and Macbook Air all have the same problem. The WiFi network works fine, but after about an hour or less, the Wifi stops working. Things just hang when I try to things like open a webpage or ping yahoo.com. The WiFi signal icon is still on, however. The fix for me is to turn off my wireless on my Apple device and turn it back on again. \nBut this is annoying. How can I fix this? I'm using a Zonet Wifi router with WPA2 on. My ASUS Ubuntu netbook has no problems staying on the WiFi network.\n\nA: I agree that since your problem occurs over many devices it is unlikely to be a problem with the Apple devices. I appreciate your point about the Ubuntu device still appearing to work, but it still seems more likely to be a router problem (it could be for example the router is producing multiple errors that the Apple software is catching).\nI'd suggest a hard reset of the router as Step 1 (before you do so however make sure you know ALL your current router settings, not just your name and password. I take a screenshot of each setting page)\nMost routers have a Reset button you have to press with a paperclip.\nPower off the router for several minutes, then apply power and do an immediate reset.\n\nA: Networking problems can be a little bit of hit and miss when troubleshooting. My first guess is that this is not related to your wireless router, but to the way the Apple devices are renewing their IP address from the router (I presume that you are using standard settings and are handing dynamic IP addresses via DHCP). I say this because you mention that your Ubuntu laptop has no issues and because all devices continue to show an active Wi-Fi indicator. \nMy recommendation would be to first make sure that there are no IP conflicts between your devices. First, turn off the Apple TV, iPad and all Apple devices except for the MacBook Air. Then use the MacBook Air as you normally would to find out if you still loose your connection to the Internet after an hour or so. If you don't loose your connection to the Internet, then turn on the next Apple device and pay close attention to who is the first one to loose connectivity and when. \nI have seen this problem happen to me whenever I use the my Clear Wi-Fi hotspot when I am on-the-go. I will get messages from the MacBook (not the iPhone, although I know they both are having the same problem) telling me that the IP was lost because another device is using it. This problem does not occur when I am at home using the Wi-Fi network served by an Apple AirPort Express rotuer. \nI highly recommend the AirPort. However, if you want to keep using your existing router and you confirm the IP conflicts I suspect of on the paragraphs above, then I suggest configuring your router to not hand out IP's with DHCP, but rather to have your devices use static IP's and see if that helps. It is a little bit of a pain to do so, but it may be the only way your devices can co-exist. \nHope these thoughts help. Good luck. \n\nA: Since it affects multiple devices, I suspect it's a problem with your router. On the official Apple discussion board someone had a similar problem with a Zonet router and the issue resolved itself when they replaced it. Fortunately, routers aren't that expensive - the extremely solid and reliable WRT54GL is available on Newegg for $50 and won't cause any problems for your Apple devices.\n\nA: I'am using an Airport router along with another router (modem). I had no problem for years and it recently become so annoying my experience tell me that the router need to be retired.  I do a hard reset first - if it works I will keep it.\n", "Q: Mail.app and multiple copies of emails I start using Mail.app today. I have two Gmail accounts (one free hosted and one on Google Apps). In Mail.app I created two IMAP accounts according to the official Google manual.\nBut when somebody send my a mail, I receive two copies of it: one copy in each inbox. Could somebody please explain me what's going on here?\nThanks in advance for your help.\nBest, Andrej\n\nA: To flesh out an answer from your comment in case other people encounter this problem...\nYou need to provide the full e-mail address as the username. If you have two accounts with different domains and the same local part and you only specify the local part as the username, it can cause problems. \n\n\n*\n\n*First.Last@gmail.com\n\n*First.Last@company.com\n\n\nIt may appear that both accounts are 'working' (as in no connection errors) but really it is just connected to the same account twice causing the double messages as you described.\n", "Q: Ethernet and Airport Problems We have one canon copier machine which is connected to our LAN router via Ethernet cable. Currently, we are connecting to the Internet using a different router. To work with the printer, I need to manually configure the Ethernet connection as follows.\nIp Address: 192.168.1.19\nSubnetmask: 255.255.255.0\nRouter: 192.168.1.1  \nWhen set with the above settings and connected to both the Ethernet network and the Airport (Internet) network, I can print, but I cannot browse the Internet anymore.\nCould this be caused by an ip conflict ?\nI can setup like this in windows and can use both printer and Internet at the same time. Should I use the same router for both Internet and LAN connections?  Is there any way to solve this?\n\nA: I'm guessing here, but it your network settings may have the ethernet interface prioritized above the AirPort (this is the default setting), meaning that when both are connected it'll try to reach the internet through the ethernet connection.  You can check this easily be looking at the order the network \"services\" are listed in the sidebar of the Network system preference pane.  If Ethernet is prioritized above AirPort, change it by selecting Set Service Order from the action (gear) pop-up menu below the service list, then dragging AirPort above Ethernet.  Note that you need to click the Apply button for the change to take effect.\n\nA: I suspect the issue might be that your routers probably have the same IP address on both networks.  So if your printer router and your internet router both have an IP address of 192.168.1.1 then your Mac may not know which interface to choose for traffic to that network.  So it will probably pick the network which is listed first on the list in System Preferences > Network.  \nYou could try reconfiguring the printer router to have an IP address of 192.168.2.1 and setting it to use DHCP with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.  Then your Mac could have an IP address of 192.168.2.19 and it would know that traffic for the printer should go out on the wired connection.\nJust as a note, you can change the order your Mac selects networks by clicking the gear wheel button beneath the interface list and choosing 'Set Service Order' but I don't think that's going to help you in this case.\n\nA: The ideal solution is indeed to simplify your home network by only having a single router (likely the existing Airport router).  Using a single router and it's DHCP server will assure that all of your home devices are assigned IP addresses that are within the same IP subnet and can therefore all communicate with one another.\nYou could consider replacing the second router near the Canon copier with a WiFi-to-Ethernet bridge to provide available wired Ethernet ports but simply bridge them to the existing Airport network.  A bridge keeps all the devices on the same IP subnet (unlike a router in it's default configuration).  If the router near the copier also has wireless capabilities you may be able to configure it as a bridge instead of a router by looking through it's web configuration screen.\nOnce all of your wired and wireless devices are on the same IP subnet and using the same router (default gateway) then they will all be able to both see each other on the network and also get to the Internet.\n\nA: Got the Network preferences pane in System preferences. Drag Airport to the top of the list.\n", "Q: Why do iPhone App Store ratings and reviews seem to get processed so slowly? I'm trying to figure out what's going on with Apple's ratings/reviews system on the App Store. I've had issues with my own app (ratings/reviews not showing) now I see a major app with similar issues...\nThe Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2011 free app was released just 2 days ago (Feb 14). It now has 29 ratings and 9 reviews (one review is mine posted from night of 2/15). But this has got to be a well downloaded app right? I'm talking 1000's probably just in the first day, so where are the other reviews/ratings?\nDoes anyone know if:\n1) Apple has humans approve all ratings/reviews before letting them show?\n2) Apple has an algorithm for passing/rejecting ratings/reviews?\n3) What is the exact time delay between posting a review/rating and it appearing on the App Store?\nAlso-> Have you had any experience with a review or rating not showing in the App Store ever or only after a long delay?\n\nA: Ratings appear very quickly, and do not appear to require approval (can't imagine that they would). The reality is that almost no one rates the apps they download, and since \"rate on delete\" was eliminated with iOS 4, even fewer ratings will appear. (The removal of \"rate on delete,\" where the OS asked you to immediately rate an app when you deleted it, is generally a good thing, since someone deleting it is much more likely to dislike an app than someone keeping it, which resulted in significantly skewed ratings).\nReviews sometimes appear very quickly -- within minutes of submission -- and sometimes take up to a day to appear. Last year there were some significant abuses of the review system that became public, including mass reviews submitted by marketing companies (through individual accounts set up for that purpose), so it's likely that Apple changed their policies at that point. From what I can tell, if an account has a long history of ratings across multiple developers, reviews can appear very quickly, but there seems to be a delay for new accounts or those with few reviews, which may well be approved by humans.\nHowever, as Phillip wrote, the actual process is entirely unknown, and Apple intentionally keeps it that way.\nPersonally, its never taken more than a few hours before my reviews appeared, and it's usually within minutes.\n\nEdited to add\nJust wrote another review and noticed that below the entry area it says,\n\nIf a review is deemed inappropriate, it will not be posted to the App Store.\n\nwhich implies potential review, and after the review is entered it says,\n\nYour review has been successfully submitted. Please note that it may be reviewed and will not appear in the store immediately.\n\nThe \"it may be reviewed\" at least partially supports my \"depends on your account\" theory.\n\nA: I think the time for ratings to show in the store is directly affected by the number of ratings submitted and not at all related to time passing.\nOnce your app hits a (unknown / undisclosed / and perhaps time dependent) critical mass of ratings - the data gets exposed to everyone.\nI know nothing other than as a user - sometimes I have left ratings and reviews that never showed up for obscure apps. I have no insider insight and know of nowhere (even inside the NDA discussions) where this is actually documented.\n\nA: This comes up from time to time and, like always, it's probably safe to say that any algorithms related to the App Store rankings, comments, reviews are all company secrets that no one is going to divulge. The same goes for the number of downloads for any app. Unless SI states publicly how many downloads they have so far, there's no way to really find out as Apple treats that information with the strictest confidence. I would be very surprised if anyone had viable (actionable) answers to your questions.\n\nA: I have rated many major apps, mostly with positive feedback, such as GarageBand, The Simpsons Tapped Out, and Bejewled, and I have never seen one of my reviews appear on the App Store.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone support TRIM for flash memory? I'm asking if TRIM is enabled on iOS because, ever since I ran out of memory on my iPhone (have since cleared a few GB back), it seems to be slower than it was before. My suspicion being that, with most flash memory \"sectors\" now partially used, every write operation now takes longer…\nRelying heavily on flash memory, I wonder if the iPhone implements TRIM (or any \"trim-like\" feature) to maximize flash memory performance and specifically if that will let me troubleshoot a slow phone and/or know if I would want to jailbreak the device to enable TRIM or otherwise control storage more tightly than iOS is delivered.\n\nA: Since I'm just a generic curious who can do some research on the web, I'll make here some assumptions so we can be on the same grounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*TRIM is an SSD technology and, as such, can mean too many  different things.\n\n*iPhone uses MLC NAND memory, which is indeed a SSD.\n\n*We, people, (such as dhy8386 and maybe even Mr. Brian Klug) love to talk big about things we don't know deep enough. To know more, trust less.\n\n*Apple mostly does not disclose anything technically meaningful about their technology. And it does use many proprietary technologies nobody else does.\n\n*Even today, the iPhone will work way more flawlessly under deep stress (filled memory, many applications, etc) than any Android or Windows Phone. (yes, I've used them all and I currently own a S3)\n\n\nIf you follow every link above deep enough, you may realize it's just not that simple. Even Android's TRIM support probably isn't the same TRIM as a notebook uses on its SSD.\nSo, it doesn't matter if it supports TRIM or not. The whole point of going with an iPhone is trusting Apple and letting them do the hardcore tech work. And the whole point of jailbreaking is being able to do things Apple can't allow for any reason, such as unblocking carriers. Anything else on JB is doing it wrong (specially now we have android, even for iPhone) - and I'm saying that from my heavy experience using jailbreak from iPhone 3 to 4.\nNow, to address your main and unannounced question, best thing you can do to test if your hardware is malfunctioning is to backup your iPhone and reset to factory. Then fill it up with music or pictures, since you suspect a full disk is causing the malfunctioning, and avoid installing  applications at all. You probably won't see any problem and, if you do, just send it to warranty. You can also send it to warranty directly, but you risk of it coming back and just losing few days there.\n\nA: It is not a question that can be answered with yes or no as it depends on both which kind of iPhone (model) and version of iOS, you're interested in.\nIn general I can say that TRIM is not used, simply because TRIM is a specific command found in the SATA protocol. As no iPhone uses a SATA storage interface, they cannot ofcourse implement TRIM.\nThe disk on the iPhone is actually a NAND flash directly soldered to the PCB in the phone. This means that there's no SATA-connector or PCIe connector or similar. However the actual electrical and logical protocols used for transferring data differs depending on model and iOS versions.\nNAND flash chips work differently than an old fashioned hard drive. In order for the kernel and application software on an iPhone to treat them as a linear space of \"blocks\" or \"bytes\" something needs to happen.\nOn iOS 1 and 2 this was done through a flash translation layer called VFL. On iOS 3 and 4.0 Apple switched to using YaFTL and VSFL. On iOS 4.1 and later, they changed again to PPNFTL for those phones that had physical hardware with PPN (Perfect Page New NAND flash). Only on the PPN hardware is there are an actual controller inside the NAND flash. However most of the flash translation work actually still takes place in software.\nIn addition to handling the conversion between actual \"flash realities\" and the \"linear space of blocks\" logical view, the FTL is also responsible for doing wear-levelling. The functionality you know as TRIM is actually deeply rooted in the wear-levelling system.\nThe short answer is that the use of a \"TRIM-like\" functionality is very much dependent on your actual iPhone hardware model, the iOS version used and on whether or not Apple has actually decided to use the functionality. It is however clear that Apple designed the NAND layouts and flash translation layers to actually support a TRIM-like functionality, and they did this many years ago. So it would make sense that it is also being used. However it is not documented publicly whether or not Apple actually uses this TRIM-like functionality in practice.\nYou can read more about the layouts and flash translations layers in iOS/iPhone here:\nhttp://esec-lab.sogeti.com/posts/2012/06/28/low-level-ios-forensics.html\n", "Q: Is there a way to connect my iPod touch to the internet without wireless connection (say, by usb)? If I have no wireless connection, can I connect to the internet using the usb on the computer, or some other way?\n\nA: Not that I know of however you could try turning internet sharing on on your computer. This will create a wireless network that you can use on your iPod Touch. \nThis is easy to do if you are using a Mac. Assuming that internet comes in over Ethernet, go to the Sharing tab in the System Preferences application. Click the internet sharing tick box and configure it to share over Airport. (this is from memory as I don't have access to a Mac right at the moment but you can probably work it out.\nSome further details are available here.\n\nA: Interesting question. It is like tethering but in reverse. :)\nI don't think you have other options beside WiFi if you are not jailbroken. If you are, you could use MyWi to connect your iPod to an iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth. Costs $20 though.\n", "Q: If iPhones/iPads don't support Flash, how do they play YouTube? Which technology do iPhones and iPads use to play YouTube without supporting Flash?\n\nA: Nivas said all there's to know about H.264, the format used by YouTube to stream video. But that's how the video is encoded and decoded and it's used by flash, iOS (iPhone operating system) and HTML5.\nThe real difference is how the request for the video is done. In a nutshell, iPhone requests it the same way HTML5 and Flash do but grab the answer from youtube and plays it elsewhere instead of the browser or flash.\nOn a desktop, when you get to youtube.com it identifies you're on a desktop browser, because the browser informs YouTube about it. Then YouTube points you to the Flash version and all its code is already programmed to play the video in its own way. That also envolves HTML and H.264. So picture the path a byte of the video do from YouTube files to your screen. It'd be something like this:\n\nYouTube streaming server -> your browser -> Flash -> screen.\n\nWhen you point your browser to the HTML5 version of YouTube, the code in there just expects your browser will be able to play it using no Flash. So the video byte path would be:\n\nYouTube streaming server -> your browser -> screen\n\nIt's funny how simple it is to think about it now, but HTML4 never had any code to communicate \"play video\" on its own, and no browser were expected to be able to do so. So HTML5-enabled browsers actually are video players on their own as well.\nBoth that new browser and Flash have basically the same source code to be able to decode H.264 and both need the codec to be available from the operating system. But each one have their own implementation of it.\nOn iOS, whenever it identifies \"YouTube\" while you're browsing, it looks for either code, HTML5 or Flash embedded, grabs the video reference from that code and just ask YouTube for the video directly. Much the very same way HTML5 does. But instead to play it within the browser, it calls an iOS API to play it from the video player. So the video byte path is:\n\nYouTube streaming server -> iOS video player -> screen\n\nOf course, there's a whole lot more beyond that, but those are the basic concepts. So the technology iPhone uses is all the same and practically transparent to YouTube servers.\n\nA: YouTube also has HTML5 players - they recently changed their embed code to an iframed method which allows HTML5 and Flash to be shown depending on your browser setup, which the iPhone supports.\nEssentially, the Flash player is a way of playing a video file, so the file is available in a readable format (as Nivas was saying) that the iPhone/iPad can open in its media player.\nSoundcloud also works on the iPhone, which I think is down to HTML5.\n\nA: They use a format called H.264. YouTube and other video sites deliver content in this format also (so that their videos are viewable on iPad/iPod touch).\nOne advantage of H.264 is that hardware based encoding/decoding can be used.\nSee also Steve Jobs's Thoughts on Flash\nH.264 is one of the formats for video support in the latest version of HTML, HTML 5. Apple supports this in Safari and Google in Chrome*.\n*Google recently announced that it will no longer support H.264 in the future versions of Chrome.\nBecause of this H.264 is kind of hot of late. See these articles.\n\nA: When you upload a video on Youtube, it is converted into multiples formats, sizes and codec (not only FLV/VP6 flash video!).\nDoing this, Youtube can serve you the best compatible option when you request a video depending the application / web browser (mobile or not) / bandwidth you have.\n\nA: What does H.264 encoding technology to do with Adobe Flash and applications for embedding content?\nH.264 is a protocol codec. This means you use this protocol for \"creating\" a movie. Once you have the movie, you need an application for playing the movie. \nThis is what Adobe Flash does (and many other applications). \nSee the Wikipedia page for more information.\nWhat mr andyface says make much more sense. So I suppose Safari supports HTML5.\n", "Q: Can't boot Mac, only shows a Folder with a Question Mark? How do I start up a Mac when all it shows is a Folder with a Question Mark, even with a DVD in the drive?\n\nImage courtesy of Loïc Wolff\n\nA: A folder with a question mark means your Mac can't find the system startup software.\nFollow the troubleshooting steps in this Apple Support technote: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2570\n\nA: I just went through this my self!\nYour Mac can't find anything to boot from. Or more specifically, it can't find the system folder on your primary boot device.\nTry booting from your OS X DVD and running Utilities -> Disk Utility to check your boot drive for errors.\nTo boot from your DVD, insert in to Mac, turn off Mac, and hold C while you turn it on. You have to hold it until it chimes IIRC. That'll tell it to boot from the DVD.\n\nA: I find both the answers from Ian C. and ghoppe correct and accurate, so I gave them both a +1, because they're both right.\nIf it was me I'd try the Disk Utility tactic first because you may have nothing more than a case of index corruption on the hard drive and that might fix it up. The next most likely cause, in my opinion,  could be that the drive has developed bad sectors in the boot code and it can't even read the startup stuff. Finally, it's possible that the NVRAM/PRAM has become corrupt. This can happen, but not as frequently as the other two. I've seen indexing problems induced into Mac's when the power gets cut on and off quickly during the boot process. If this has happened to you it might be a good possibility, and Disk Utility might be able to clear it up.\nIf you use Disk Utility and it does a semi-recovery of your HD, it might be rendered read-only, meaning it can't completely reconstruct your index files, but what it can recover will likely be rendered read-only. In this case, a tool such as Disk Warrior may be of use to you, but it's expensive. \nIf you have an external hard drive that's bootable, you could obtain Scannerz (http://www.scsc-online.com) and scan the drive for bad sectors. Scannerz can also, if used skillfully, determine other problems on your system but it requires a bit of knowledge as to how a system functions. I could teach my dog to do basic drive testing on a drive with Scannerz, but using it to isolate other faults, like bad cables, connectors, or logic board problems requires at least a little knowledge about basic systems and hwo they work. The company that makes this product has some troubleshooting procedures about the process in their downloads section of their web site.\nIf your a hard core techie, once again with an external hard drive, you could download smartmontools (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki), run it off the externally bootable HD and see if your drive is even working. Both Scannerz and Disk Utility only report what I'd call \"threshold\" S.M.A.R.T. data (i.e PASS/FAIL) but this can report a lot more. Unfortunately, S.M.A.R.T. can often miss some problems with a drive until an actual write operation occurs and fails, so problems may exist that such tools may miss. smartmontools is command line only and needs to be run via a terminal. Newer versions of Disk Utility also provide better S.M.A.R.T. reporting, but IMHO it's still not stellar.\nWith luck, it will be something simple.\n\nA: *\n\n*Power off by pressing the Power Button for few second\n\n*Press the Power Button- after the beep sound - Press Command + R\n\n*Connect Internet (it will download the Disk Utility Manger)\n\n*Select Reinstall OS X\n\n\nA: The temporary solution i have found is to boot in safe mode. Press and hold the Shift key when you turn the mac on, before hearing the boot sound.\nThis will spare you the recovery procees, cause i dont wanna réinstall everything yet.\nThen in safe mode you can launch disk utility, repair some stuff, and then reboot. Beware, do not turn off thé mac, just select \"reboot\"\n", "Q: How do iPhone apps push notifications when the app isn't running? I've read some docs about notifications and background work, but there is something I do not understand.\nYesterday, I upgraded to iOS 4.2, rebooted my phone many times, and did not launch any apps. Then this morning I received a push notification from PandoraBox to inform me that an app I've placed in favorite had its price changed.\nI wonder how this app, that is not launched, not in background, that cannot know in advance when the price of an app in MY favorites will change, can alert me with a notification this way?\nIt HAS to run some methods, some code… But I understood that that is not possible. What did I miss?\n\nA: You must have launched PandoraBox before the reboot of your iPhone, right?\nWhen you launch apps that send notifications, they keep the way to identify you and throw notifications to your phone. \nSo the answer to your question is : \"the code is running on some PandoraBox machine, not on your iPhone\".\n", "Q: How can I check ethernet card? I doubt a hardware problem with my ethernet device. I'm unable to connect to Internet. How can I verify if it's a hardware issue or not?\n\nA: If you have access to a second computer, connect it to the same ethernet cable and port.  If that computer gets internet access (be sure to disable wireless, so you know it's connecting via ethernet), the first computer's ethernet device is faulty.  If the second computer does not get internet access, try swapping the ethernet cable for another (the first could be badly crimped or faulty in other ways), and try another ethernet port.  \n\nA: Full hardware testing is difficult. There is an application Tech Tools that can do pretty decent hardware checks on OS X.\nHonestly, I you can see information about the NIC under Apple Menu, About This Mac, More Info, Ethernet Cards I would say the device is good. This isn't a 100% guarantee but with the frequency or hardware failure vs network issues I would say validating this would make me look into the network issues first.\n\nA: I think simply connecting the network cable to the ethernet port and turn on the computer. Now it's not turning no the LEDs which means the hardware seems gone!\n", "Q: How can I convert an AI file to a CDR file? Assume I have an AI file, Adobe Illustrator CS 5 and no CorelDraw. How can I convert this AI file to CDR file? What is the fastest and cheapiest way?\n\nA: What version of CorelDRAW? What's the workflow? \n.CDR is a proprietary format, so I'm not aware of any proper supported exporters. The sK1 project reverse-engineered the format, and claims to have the best support. But since recent versions of CorelDRAW can import Adobe Illustrator CS4 files, I think you would get the best results to just save it as .ai and import it into CorelDRAW.\n\nA: This answer may be what you are looking for:\nhttp://en.allexperts.com/q/Adobe-Illustrator-1027/Converting-Illustrator-Corel-Draw.htm\n", "Q: Security hole in firmware password by installing another boot loader? I set up a firmware password on my MacBook. One thing I don't understand is how I can install a tool such as rEFIt, and effectively bypass the entire firmware password (i.e. installing it never asked for my original Firmware password).\nIt says on their website:\n\n[...] since “refit.efi” is configured as the legitimate boot loader, it effectively circumvents the firmware password protection.\n\nIsn't that a huge security hole in setting up a firmware password? Doesn't that mean that the securing a computer by setting up a firmware password is only as strong as an admin account's password (i.e. someone that has privileges to install a tool such as rEFIt)?\n\nA: Yes, but this is not particularly a problem with rEFIt, it's intrinsic to the way firmware password and admin access relate to each other -- if you have either one, you can take control of the other.  For instance, if you have admin access, you can disable or change the firmware password with nvram command,  You can also change the boot volume with System Preferences, effectively bypassing the firmware password protection.\nBasically, the firmware password is there to protect the integrity of the computer until the OS starts and can start enforcing its idea of access controls, at which point admin passwords are the relevant control.  Don't think of firmware password as a higher-level control, it's more of a supplement.\n\nA: Yes that is correct sadly, although you do need admin access to install an EFI loader to circumvent this most accounts don't have root access and as such you can have an admin account with one password but a different root password altogether. Or you can simply deny your account root access and make another root password.\nTo add on to this, firmware passwords are not very strong to begin with. If I had physical access to your laptop I can simply reset the PRAM and your password is null and void. It's not supposed to be very strong (to be honest I see no point in it).\n", "Q: What does a firmware password protect? If I create a firmware password on my MacBook, what does that protect me from?\nDoes it protect from any of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformatting the hard drive.\n\n*Switching OS to boot from (e.g. if Boot Camp is installed).\n\n*Restoring the laptop to its original factory settings (i.e. reinstalling OS X).\n\n*Installing another boot loader such as rEFIt which bypasses the firmware password\n\nA: Installing a firmware password will prevent anyone without the password from selecting a different boot disk to start up the computer. It will also disable some startup key sequences, like getting into single-user mode. I don't know how the firmware password interacts with something like rEFIt.\nHowever, if someone can open your computer, they can disable the firmware password by pulling one of the sticks of RAM and/or just access your hard drive directly and do what they want with it.\n\nA: All of the above can be performed if the person has physical access to the computer.  \nSee the Apple support page I've linked to below, it explains that resetting the PRAM or Open Firmware will reset the password and allow someone to do any of the things you've listed above.  \nApple page on firmware password protection\n\nA: Setting firmware password protects the computer from access to the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Blocks the ability to use the \"C\" key to start up from an optical disc. (Power PC + Intel)\n\n*Blocks the ability to use the \"D\" key to start up from the Diagnostic volume of the Install DVD.

I'm using VMWare Fusion with my Boot Camp partition. Are there any problems with installing Windows 7 Updates through VMWare Fusion, or should I boot up into Boot Camp in order to install these updates?\n\nA: It's been a while since I've used Windows, but I seem to recall that Microsoft does provide driver updates with the Windows Update, and whether or not you get the update may depend on the hardware that Windows detects you're running. To be on the safe side, I'd suggest running Windows Update both virtually and natively.\n\nA: I have used Windows updates through BootCamp with no problems.\nAs for drivers I think they all come from BootCamp so the Apple update would do these and I would do that from BootCamp.\n", "Q: Mac OS X keeps to ask me if I want to allow iTunes to accept connections Every time I open iTunes, Mac OS X keeps to ask me if I want to allow it to accept connections, even if in the Firewall settings iTunes has been set to accept any connections.\nI am not using a beta version of iTunes.\nHow can I avoid this issue?\n\nA: That's unusual because applications created by Apple should be automatically permitted access through the firewall.  Have you modified iTunes (added plugins for example) in any way?  You can check if iTunes' digital signature is valid with the following Terminal command:  \ncodesign -vvv /Applications/iTunes.app/ \nYou should get two lines back looking like those in the image below  \n \nIf these don't match with what I have or even if they do, a reinstall of iTunes or removal of any plugins should fix it.  \nUse the following steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall iTunes.  \n\n*Empty Trash.  \n\n*Restart the Mac.  \n\n*Reinstall iTunes\n\n", "Q: Tool or trick to require doubleclicking to launch apps from dock? Is there a way to make it so that launching an app from the dock requires a double click instead of a single click?  I find myself accidentally launching apps and then needing to force-quit them.  \nI'm hoping for some OS hack or third-party app.  Yes, I already have the dock hidden.\nthanks!\n\nA: You can move the dock's location and size by going to System Preferences > Dock. Rather than keeping the dock at the bottom, where the mouse needs to be often, move it to either the right or left sides of the screen. \nI auto-hide the dock on the left side of the screen (I'm on a 13\" MacBook Air, so my vertical space is limited too). You could also use @VxJasonxV's suggestion of removing the apps from the dock. Most of the programs I launch are via  spotlight (the ⌘+Space shortcut is very useful). And the last trick I use is BetterTouchTool. I bound five-finger-click to ⌘+Q, which makes it very easy to quit applications, but not so easy that it accidentally quits applications I didn't mean to quit.\n\nA: *\n\n*Don't hide the Dock. You'll be less surprised when it pops out at you and eats your click.\n\n*If applications must be \"force quit\" when you accidentally open them, get them out of your Dock! Use a launcher like Alfred, LaunchBar, Quicksilver, or Google Quick Search Box.

I have 3 files about 40 KB each. When I combine them using Preview and save them as a single PDF file, instead of having a size close to 120 KB, the size is closer to 500 KB.\nWhy does this happen, and is there any way to retain a small file size when the files are combined?\n\nA: PDFs are funny creatures because Postscript is a very \"fat\" language; the same PDF can be written multiple ways. I would say that the extra code is probably glue code to put those three documents together and extra bits placed there by whatever utility was used to combine the three. \nThe best way to get rid of this would be to open the PDF in Acrobat Professional (not Reader) and run it through the \"Reduce File Size...\" command. This strips out any dead or unnecessary code, optimizes fonts (if two instances of the same font exist, the PDF is rewritten so that only one instance exists), and the like. \nGhostscript probably has a function that does something similar, but off-hand I'm not sure which one that would be.\n\nA: Preview's \"Reduce File Size\" feature takes a 512KB file down to 254KB, but makes the text very blurry and difficult to read.\nOn Acrobat Standard (Windows), the \"Reduce File size...\" feature takes the 512KB file down to 418KB, but maintains the exact same quality that the original had.\nTherefore, reducing the file size after the file was combined is not a good option. A better option is to use a more efficient program to combine the files...\nI found out that Acrobat Standard is better than Preview at combining PDF files and maintaining a small file size. For example, if you have two 61KB files to combine, Preview will produce a 311KB file, while Acrobat (with the \"Default File Size\" option enabled) will produce a 106KB file.\n\nA: This is similar to Nate Stevens' answer. For anyone who still has this problem, I had used the \"insert\" option from the edit menu, and got a file size about 6 times larger than the sum of the individual file sizes. \nHowever, when I simply dragged and dropped the pdfs into the sidebar (thumbnail view), I got just a little larger than the sum of the individual file sizes.\n\nA: I suspect this is caused by images rendered by Preview and re-encoded in a lower compression level. How was your PDF created in the first place?\nAnother possibility is that characters where seen as character in the original file, but are rendered as bitmaps in the produced PDF.\n\nA: I know that I am years too late to help the author of the original post but I just had this problem and figured it out. I had combined multiple PDF files in preview and they were appearing all different sizes. To fix the sizing go to print the document and instead of printing save as PDF through the print menu. This will give you a new pdf with all pages sized correctly but you will no longer be able to edit any of the text so make all the changes you need before you consolidate the sizing.\nGood luck to anyone having this problem. I hope that I have helped.\n", "Q: Replacement DVD drive for MacBook Pro Howdy. I have a MacBook Pro 15\" (MB133LL/A) with a Matsushita UJ-867 DVD drive. The DVD drive is failing and I'm looking for a replacement.\nAre there any other supported drives for this machine than the UJ-867?\n\nA: There are some variations in the drives supplied in Apple's products. For example, often Apple will have multiple suppliers for a part, and products often have hardware options.

Note that I'm NOT talking about clock/timer alarms.\nI've rebooted the iPhone, and it's still alerting me both ways.\nWhat else should I check?\n\nA: The calendar alert is something that you asked for so will not be suppressed by the Silent switch. According to the HIG the switch is supposed to indicate that you do not wish to hear unsolicited sounds such as incoming call ringtones.\n\nA: A firmware update resolved the issue for me.

I'd like to to add an icon to my homescreen that takes me directly to a specific note. What I was thinking was doing it by having a bookmark in safari that triggers that note, and adding a shortcut to that bookmark to my homescreen. This would open safari, then open notes, to that note, similar to how an iTunes link in Safari opens the app store or iTunes app. Is this possible or is there an alternate solution?\nis there a syntax like apps//notes.app/noteid or something to accomplish this? \niPhone 4 \niOS 4.2\nWhy I want it: I use a specific note frequently and I'd like quick access to that one, without opening notes, scrolling to, and selecting it.\n\nA: Unfortunately there's no url scheme for the Notes app, so there's no way to jump to a specific one. \nThere are two good sites for finding iOS app url schemes, handleOpenURL and the iPhone URL Schemes page on Akosma's wiki. The former has many more urls, but the latter occasionally has something the other doesn't.\nA quick search in handleOpenURL for \"text\" and for \"note\" only shows one app that appears that it can do what you want (which doesn't mean it's the only app that does so, just that it's the only one listed in the site), though even then I'm not certain you'll be able to create the shortcut by hand. \nI'm completely unfamiliar with the app and have no idea whether it's worthwhile, but I figure it's worth passing on: Notebooks for iPhone.\n\nA: If you want to open only the same note every time there is an app for that: DraftPad.

I was trying to create a symbolic link using the following command:\nln -s \"~/Foo Bar/\" Foo\n\n... but it didn't work (i.e. when I go into finder and try double clicking it, it says that it's pointing to an invalid path and prompts me to delete the alias or fix it). I had to rename the folder to FooBar and then run the following command:\nln -s ~/FooBar/ Foo\n\nHow can I create the link without having to remove the space from the folder's name?\nI'm looking for a way to do this in Terminal and not in Finder's UI.\n\nA: The quote marks are preventing ~ from being expanded to your home folder, so you need to either quote just the part with the space in it:\nln -s ~/\"Foo Bar/\" Foo\n\nNote: exactly how much is quoted doesn't matter, as long as the space is in the quoted portion and the ~/ isn't. ~/Foo\" \"Bar/, ~/\"Foo Bar\"/, ~/Fo\"o B\"ar/ etc are all equivalent. Also, single- and double-quotes have the same effect on spaces (although they differ on other characters), so ~/'Foo Bar/', ~/Foo' 'Bar/ etc would also work.\nYou could also use an escape to prevent the space from being treated as a separator:\nln -s ~/Foo\\ Bar/ Foo\n\n\nA: I tested it myself. I don't have a problem with a space in it:\n    $ ln -s \"/Users/joe/test/foo bar\"/ linkToFoo_Bar\n\nls shows:  $ linkToFoo_Bar -> /Users/joe/test/foo bar/\nand it works in terminal and finder without any problems. \n", "Q: Where are Services stored?

How can I fix it? I've noticed that my iPhone 4's home button does not work very well. Sometimes I have to press it multiple times, or press it very hard to get it to register a click. Sometimes it will detect a double-click even though I only press it once.\nAfter several clicks, the button seems to loosen up and work fine for a while.  But the next time I take it out of my pocket, it will be flaky again.\nThe obvious solution is to take it in to the Genius Bar at the Apple Store and ask for repair/replacement. But there are a couple of problems with that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple Store is 90 minutes away, so I'd rather not make the trip unless I'm pretty sure I'll get a resolution.\n\n*Due to the \"loosening\" effect described above, I'm concerned that it will appear to be working just fine when I show it to the Genius.\n\n\nSo, does anyone else have experience with this problem? Did you get it fixed at the Apple Store, and if so, did it seem to be a common problem? Is there any way to fix it other than by taking it to the Apple Store?\n\nA: Take it to the Apple Store. Tell them exactly what is going on and that it's a real problem for you. Even if they can't recreate the problem there in store, they will replace the device. I had a similar issue with my iPad. I took it in and explained everything and even though they couldn't replicate it they replaced it. \nIf anything, they will help you get a resolution. I've never gone into an Apple store with a problem only to have them tell me \"Sorry, nothing we can do.\" \n\nA: I know this question has been answered, but I wanted to offer up some useful information that I learned from the Apple Store. The home button on my wife's iPhone 4 was acting flaky, so I brought it in to a technician. After asking me whether I've tried a soft, hard and factory reset, he notified us that the phone was out of warranty, and it would cost $149 to replace it. But then, he also offered a workaround that I was not aware of: AssistiveTouch.\nBasically, this allows you to access some system-level functions from an onscreen menu. In particular, this gives you a software home button, and it's baked into iOS5! It even responds to double and triple taps. If your home button is flaky or broken, this is a robust workaround. This also comes in handy if any of your other hardware components are broken; you can mute/unmute, do a \"shake\", adjust volume, rotate/lock screen.\nTo access it, go to Settings->General->Accessibility:\nhttp://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/bentsai/wZUCuTIWcGqdve7tyuOeYmP5utpmcgzZ6p6a6S4g5ZONmN7cc79L5BPeIYV5/photo.png\nScroll down to the Physical & Motor and tap AssistiveTouch:\nhttp://getfile5.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/bentsai/oFVIebHqAK4LQPjKdqCRFKaOGLfo6fNJjExdRm1bPN7J0Qofth6U44CLm93y/photo.png\nYou will get an overlayed touch target, which opens a menu where you can operate the home button, among other things:\nhttp://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/bentsai/5JiHhvpXUUtyFmec4Tli1xabng39mHeP1jLcL9No97i0TlnGxnQ3kiXiCw9L/photo.png\n\nA: I've seen many \"flakey\" home buttons be a problem with the software and not a real hardware issue. Getting it into the hands of a Apple Store technician is great as they are trained to work with you to isolate the issue to hardware or software and reach resolution or a plan to isolate it further. I would be prepared to let them erase the device (have a portable or backup made at home before leaving for the store) so they can eliminate software as a cause while you are in the store. That saves both of you a return trip or loss of data/contacts/apps.\nSince they see hundreds of devices a week and have no incentive to not swap your phone if it's really a hardware issue, they will often see minor physical things before most end users will.\nAs to flakey software, oftentimes a physical home button press gets delayed or lost due to the OS doing a task (garbage collection / memory warning) or a runaway process taking lots of CPU. \nHere is the procedure I use to be sure it's a bad home button hardware if I'm on the fence taking an iOS device in for service and it's not convenient to simply erase the device and set it up as new to get the cleanest OS setup possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on airplane mode - this\nisolates the phone from wifi and\ncell tower.\n\n*Do a clean shutdown\nwith \"slide to power off\" and the\nred slider - then reboot the phone\nand don't slide to unlock.\n\n\nThis creates a very minimal system with only the core system running. You can repeatedly alternate the sleep/wake and home buttons. Play around a while - light presses, slow presses, firm presses. Find how little pressure is needed to activate the home button.\nIf the button is failing - you will get failures in this minimal system. One out of ten or one out of 100 or 50% of the clicks will fail. You will be able to quickly determine a spring failure from a contact failure from any other hardware failure in 10 minutes of testing. You also have a repeatable test case to show/demonstrate the failure and not get to the store with a \"ghost\" problem that can't easily be reproduced.\nIf the button isn't failing - you will know it in your bones - the hardware button on the iPhone doesn't just get tired or fail - it's a very simple contact and spring mechanism. When it breaks, the most normal failure mode is total failure.\nIf it's not failing - then you have a software issue - something is bogging down the system so that the hardware signal is getting delayed. Perhaps a call to AppleCare or a visit to the Genius Bar is also very good for fixing software too.\nSo to sum up - do get help either way. Your phone should be responsive to home button presses. With a little knowledge, you'll quickly figure if it's one bad app - the phone needing a restore and set up as new - or a hardware repair. I wouldn't restore the phone just before taking it in - that will erase two weeks of error logs that might help point to the problem - but be prepared to let them wipe the device if needed to rule out software.\n\nA: You may want to read this fix:\n\nFix:\nTurn off ‘Triple-click Home’ (this feature is off by default) > Settings > General > Accessibility > Triple-click Home.\nIf does not work\nReset your device by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time for at least 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo.\n\nThis is how I fixed my problem.\n\nA: You mentioned the following symptoms, which I've been noticing on my iPhone as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Sometimes I have to press it multiple times, or press it very hard to get it to register a click.\"\n\n*\"After several clicks, the button seems to loosen up and work fine for a while. But the next time I take it out of my pocket, it will be flaky again.\"\n\n\nSince I ruled out the unlikely event that something is broken, I suggested that I must be some dirt or dust.\nThe little area around the home button can get dirty - just like the slots for the speaker at the top and bottom.\nI fixed it fast by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutting down the iPhone. (Not really necessary though.)\n\n*Applying WD-40, a \"penetrating oil and water-displacing spray\"1\n\n*Pressing the home button multiple times during cleaning in order for the liquid to get distributed quicker.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with my iPhone 4, having to press the home button very hard and many times to get it to respond.\nI fixed the problem by applying Isopropyl Alcohol to the edges of the home button.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the phone\n\n*Apply the alcohol to the edges of the button\n\n*Rapidly press the home button in and out 50 times\n\n*Roll your thumb over the home button for 20 seconds, ensuring that the alcohol gets worked into the contact points of the home button\n\n*Leave the phone to dry for 20 minutes\n\n*Switch it back on\n\n\nWhen I did the above, my home button works perfectly like the phone was brand new again.\n", "Q: Can all music and playlists/ratings be transferred back from an iPod Touch to a PC?

For example, a process writes to a directory, or a sandbox violation gets logged.  (Ideally when it occurs, the sandbox violation). \nIs this possible and if so how? Growl seems to work well for apps that already tell me things, but how about access of a directory?  Checksum change in tripwire? That sort of thing...\n\nA: Growl comes with a commandline tool, 'growlnotify', that can send notifications. You can use that in scripts or from tripwire to send notifications to Growl.\n", "Q: buffering location /tmp? I was a long time Ubuntu user before I moved on to a Mac; so I'm used to seeing videos on YouTube and copying the buffered files from /tmp to another place for later viewing, if I like the video.\nI tried doing the same on my Mac but its not working. Are the videos being buffered to a location other than /tmp?\n\nA: Likely they reside in the Application's Cache directory.\nLook into (HOME)/Library/Caches and (HOME)/Library/Application Support\n\nA: As an alternative, you can use something like Tooble to watch videos and later download them in the format of your choice. It has a free and a pro version as far as I know.

For example, did you add a new account recently?  Install any applications recently?\nNormally, when weird stuff happens on OS X such as crashes, repairing permissions can be a good place to start.  Try opening Disk Utility and select your computers Hard Drive on the left hand side, then click 'Repair Permissions'.  This will take a few minutes and may solve your problem.  Try a restart after the repair before you go back into Accounts.  \nHave you tried this under a different user account?  I've come across instances of people having this only occur on one account.  You could create a new account and restore documents etc from a backup.\n\nA: It may causes due to corrupt .plist file. Try removing SystemPreference plist file from ~/Library/Preferences/SystemPreference.plist(Close the Sys Pref before doing this). A new file will be created when you start System Preferences again.\n\nA: Are users authenticating with a Directory Server like OpenLDAP or Active Directory? Also, what version of OS X is being used?\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nAs suggested here, I removed the folder ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCloudHelper and that fixed it.\n", "Q: Some apps I'm finding only on iTunes, isn't there a way to buy in directly on my iPhone/iPod touch? Some apps (e.g. Angry Birds) I'm finding only on iTunes, isn't there a way to buy in directly on my iPhone/iPod touch?\n\nA: It is very likely that the iTunes store in your country (Brazil after your profile) does not have all the apps from the US AppStore. Developers can choose if they want to make their app available in all or just some countries. Since the website of Apple shows the content of the US AppStore by default it might have led you to believe that you can buy the app with your account.\n\nA: If @Andris got your problem right then, if you live in Brazil, you have the same problem I have. :-)\nI mitigate it having a second account in the US Store. That allows me to download free stuff that is only available there (games and music apps like Shazam), and when I wish to buy an app I buy an iTunes Gift Card in eBay.\nAnother solution is moving your account to the argentinian store, which has a more \"relaxed\" policy and allows apps that doesn't appear in the brazilian store. I've never tried that, but I was told that you can create an account there with a credit card that has a billing address in Brazil. That is not accepted in the US and UK stores, for example.\n\nA: Have you checked that you are logged in with the same account in both stores? Itunes sometimes doesn't have all apps available in all regions and you can have more than one account in the same library. If you are not logged in with the same account, I'd suggest you do login with the same account in both devices.\n", "Q: Default installation folder I am unhappy with the inherent insecurity of having to type in my system.install.root.user password when installing some applications.\nI realize this is necessary to install to the system wide Applications folder.\nDoes anyone know how to set the default installation location to be the Applications folder inside my home directory?\nThanks,\nTeo\n\nA: First of all, they do not (should not) require your root password, but your admin password (superuser privilege). Secondly, if you happen to be working as a standard account (so no admin privileges) on your daily basis, than yes, installing to /Applications requires an admin´s authentication; if you have admin rights, then installing something into /Application/ (and only there) should not be a problem (if it is, you need to fix permissions).\nMore in general, if we assume that the application developers know what they are doing (which unfortunately is sometimes not the case), then no, installing the ApplicationName.app bundle into your userfolder would still require admin rights. Because if they really need admin-rights to install their software, it´s probably (hopefully) because they need to install stuff other than the ApplicationName.app bundle; this can range from kernel extensions (say, you install a VPN software like OpenVPN, Hotspot Shield, etc.) to simple utilities that display your network traffic and even some Adobe Tools that all need to go into folders that are owned by other users (not in your group) to enhance overall security. And even if they just place an application into /Applications/ , they might still want to play nice and fix the permissions to root:wheel 755 .\nBasically, the Applications you install per drag&drop should be free to go where ever you want, but Installers for software that (even just for add-ons) require more than your daily userrights to run need to be run with admin rights, and thats an actual security feature. \nOr even shorter: If you do not trust the installers source, do not install. With or without admin rights, your personal data might be endangered. \n\nA: If I'm not mistaken, the default installation location is determined by the author of the installer package and not by the operating system. See the Apple Developer \"PackageMaker User Guide\" for more information.\nIn a perfect world, only Applications that require system level support files (mostly files in /Library like plugins and drivers), or absolute paths (XCode), or have complex post-install scripts, should be PackageMaker installers. Obviously we aren't in a perfect world and some folks build restrictive installers even when not 100% necessary.\nIf there is a particular application who's installer bugs you -- you might want to contact the maker and see if they can explain why they are using an installer that requires the admin password.\n\nA: Although it may not solve the security problem, and in fact will make it worse, changing permissions on the /Applications directory to make it world writeable would then allow a non-admin user to install applications in it without entering a password.\n", "Q: Is it possible to omit password from fast user switching and/or login screen? I'd like to keep user passwords and require them when doing any administrative tasks as they are required in the default installation on Mac OS X.\nIs it possible to be tweaked/hacked so that OS X won't ask for password when switching users? Or so that OS X won't ask for password in the login screen?\nIt is also essential that password is required for any remote login attempts — as they're in the default installation — be it SSH, SMB, VNC or the like.\nI'm using OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6\n\nCase example (added after first answer):\nI have two administrator accounts which I would like to allow log in and switch to locally without entering password. With \"locally\" I mean the login screen that is shown when computer is booted or user has logged out; and also the fast user switch password prompt, which is shown when the password-protected user is selected via fast user switch menulet.\nPassword should be entered if an administrative task is initiated. (I would rather not want a one common administrator account, but separate users and separate passwords.)\nIf user wants to login in, for example via SSH, the password should be entered. (I would rather not want separate \"remote-access accounts\", because I would like to use my accounts' resources hassle-free.)\n\nA: \nIs it possible to be tweaked so that OS X won't ask for password when switching users? Or so that OS X won't ask for password in the login screen?\n\nAs long as they are not administrative users, yes. (Since you indicated you still want passwords for administrative tasks.)\n\nIt is also essential that password is required for any remote login attempts — as they're in the default installation — be it SSH, SMB, VNC or the like.\n\nIn that case, you must only allow logins for administrative users.\n", "Q: Why are applications (like Adobe Fireworks and Appcelerator Titanium) crashing on startup?

If that checks out fine I'd recommend deleting the appropriate preference files from your Preferences folder (eg. com.adobe.Fireworks.plist from your Preferences folder) and see if that sorts things out.\n\nA: Try 'Repair Permissions' in Disk Utility, that's a generic fix for some problems so it's worth trying.  Sometimes files in /Library/Application Support can get corrupted during a crash, you could remove the applications causing the issues and then remove their folder from /Library/Application Support, then empty the trash and reinstall those apps.\n\nA: I had a somehow similar problem before, where InDesign CS5 would crash on startup right after I installed it for the first time. It turns out that the Adobe installer program had left all of the Adobe-related Library files as read-only. Very odd behavior, indeed. According to the Adobe support forums, I was not the only one to have had this problem. \nMy suggestion is to open a Finder window and go to a path that will look very similar to: \n/Users/YOUR-USER/Library/Preferences/Adobe InDesign/Version 7.0. \n\nOf course, you must replace YOUR-USER with your user account and Adobe InDesign with whatever Adobe program you are experiencing problems with. Also, your version number might be different. On this example, InDesign CS5 is Version 7.0, but that might be different for your version. Browsing to the Adobe-named folders within your Library, it should not be hard to find which is the right one. \nOnce you have found and selected your folder, open the File menu, and then select File/Get Info. On the last pane you will find the Sharing and Permissions options. Expand this pane, unlock the settings for this folder by clicking on the lock button, then press the plus sign (+) button. Add your user account and assign it Reading and Writing privileges. \nReopen your Adobe program and it should be able to start succesfully. The problem is most likely that it is not being able to write to its settings files within the Library special folder. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: Called Apple, they suggested I re-install the OS. Originally being a PC guy that sounded like I was going to have a couple days ahead of me to backup, format, re-install my apps etc.\nNOPE. With OS X you can re-install the OS and not affect any of your programs or user data/documents. So it just copied over all the core OS files and that seemed to fix everything.\n\nA: I had the same problem with Fireworks CS5. After starting the program, it tries to build the menu structure, but freezes while doing that.\nThe thing that worked for me was to remove the folder 'Macromedia' from /Users/YOUR-USER/Library/Preferences/. The only trouble with that folder is that it will reincarnate quite fast...\n\nA: Try the following solution that someone else posted over at Adobe:\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/3929927\nIt looks like the issue is that if you've ever installed flashfirebug, it will create a flashfirebug.cfg (possibly mm.cfg in an older version?), and this will prevent the launch of a few programs.  This seems to be also what Peter/patrix is saying above.\nFireworks CS5.1 will crash on launch; Extension Manager (I've heard) has problems launching; and it would make sense that the Updater might fail to launch as well.\n\nA: If you are near an Apple store, book an appointment with a Genius.\nThat's what they are there for.

It claims they can't be converted (I rip as Apple Lossless). Unfortunately there's not much in the way of detailed information in the error messages iTunes is giving me.\nDoes iTunes maintain a parallel, down-sampled, library on disk when I check this option? Could I downsample my Apple Lossless files myself, save them in this parallel library, and stop iTunes from trying to do the conversion on sync? I took a look in my iTunes Media folder for a parallel library but couldn't find anything.\nIs the conversion done as the songs are transferred to my iPhone and the converted files live no other place than on my phone?\nThis is iTunes 10 on OS X 10.6 with an iPhone 3GS.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with few of my tracks. The conversion is done live, while syncing. Basicly the problem is with the particular sound track, not the lossless codec (ALAC) itself. I used a third party utility to re-encode the original (keeping it to ALAC) and then iTunes managed to re-encode the track back to 128kBit AAC. Hope this helps.\n\nDoes iTunes maintain a parallel, down-sampled, library on disk when I check this option? \n\nNo - re-encoding is done live, that's why it's so slow.\n\nA: I just had this problem too, and it fixed itself when:\n\n\n*\n\n*I went to the Music/Songs view and searched for the offending song.\n\n*I noticed there were 2 copies of that song listed: one in my library, and one with an iTunes-Store download icon next to it\n\n*I clicked on that download icon and deleted the copy in my library.\n\n\nUpon re-syncing my iPhone, that song copied without issue.\n\nA: I had two songs that did not work.

In the past, we've kept a fairly open wireless network, but recently a few throughput issues have made us consider locking it down a bit more, in a play we predict will potentially preserve packet-passing performance for peers. Students would still be able to do almost anything over the wired connection available in each room, but the wireless would for the first time require authentication and be limited to only certain ports. Currently we're considering 53(dns), 80 & 443(web), 143, 587, 993, and 995 (email), and 1935 (flash video).\nThe big issue here for us is that we also give each new full-time on-campus student an iPod Touch, and so we need to make sure these devices (which are wireless only) continue to work for our students as expected.  So can anyone share any iOS apps or services that use other ports that we would need to open?  For example, if iTunes purchases, Location Services, Push Notifications, FaceTime, or certain well known apps require other ports, which apps and what ports do they use?\nThe main push behind this is density in the dorms: at certain times of day we just have too many radios active in too small a space at one time, and throughput really suffers.  So the idea is to force certain traffic (especially games and torrents) to the wired connections, which can handle this much better, and thus leave the air waves more open for other devices that don't need this capability.  So this is about making things work better rather than being more restrictive just because we can.\nNote that this will all probably come to nothing, but I do need to at least investigate it thoroughly.\n\nA: Have a look at the ports commonly used by Apple (on all devices, not only iOS) here\n(Though these are only the ones used by Apple and other Developers might use other ports) and look for specific Services (FaceTime uses many ports, so does Game Center and so on…)\n\nA: This is a bit off topic but have you considered traffic shaping instead of completely blocking ports.\nIf you limit the bandwidth lets say after a certain MB downloaded or uploaded via WiFi in a given period of time the students would soon figure out that they are better of using the wired network for their bandwidth intensive tasks.\nAs you have suggested in your question blocking ports would be an endless wack-a-mole game of user complains and port openings and if a new popular app comes along or Apple changes something in iOS (like Game Center) then you would have to re-analyze your firewall settings every time.\n\nA: As a sys admin, you would most likely want port 22 open in order to be able to use an iPod Touch SSH app.\n\nA: Cutting down peer-to-peer traffic is not an easy thing to do. Most of torrent clients support encryption and dynamic port assignment. Since it's hard to cut the crap from invading your network, you can easily make a pirate's life a nightmare by adding some basic traffic rules.  \nInstall a firewall (any Ubuntu box with two Ethernet ports will do it) and set a rule to limit the number of simultaneous connections from a single peer. \nTorrent clients gain speed by establishing multiple connections to a pool of seeders. By limiting the number of possible connections you'll make sure that none of your young guns' will be able to download faster than 15-20 kb/sec, which should be enough to release the pressure on your WiFi and discourage users from using WiFi connections to do their nasty stuff. \nI won't go through technical stuff here. Just Google it: Ubuntu gateway firewall rules, etc. \n", "Q: Mixing Two MP3s in GarageBand 09 I have two MP3s. One is an instrumental and one is an acapella.\nI want to mix the two in GarageBand, but I can't seem to find a way to change the tempo of the tracks individually.\nIt looks like the new GarageBands Flex Time would work, but I would really like to be able to do it in '09.\nIdeas?\n\nA: What you're asking could be done but chances of failure are too high. The reason is you could use a plugin to alter the tempo of one of the MP3s but that will introduce two big problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you change it beyond certain threshold, pops and clicks will start to be heard.\n\n*It will be really hard to sync them. It may look in tempo at the beginning, but a very small tempo difference will be noticeable as the tracks advance, which will require lots of micro adjustments (not good). \nMy advice is to take the tracks to an Apple Store and ask the guys there if you can use a Garageband for a couple of hours. They will rarely have any problem with that. There you can use Garageband or even a Logic Express (or pro!), that have a better Flex feature. \n", "Q: New digitizer stopped working after 30 seconds I plugged a brand new digitizer into my 2g iPod touch and I wanted to test it before I clip it in. It worked great at first and I managed to click with it for about 30 seconds, while not moving the digitizer or the iPod.\nSuddenly, it stopped working and I have been unable to get the digitizer to work again, despite reseating it numerous times. The iPod works otherwise normally.\nWhat happened? \n\nA: Make sure that both sides of the connect cable a plugged in, then make sure that the center button works.  The center button has broke for many of my friends and myself.\n\nA: I've had a digitizer die on me after a few weeks of use. I replaced the digitizer in my iPhone 3GS and it worked like a charm until one side of it just stop responding one day. (Being an iOS dev, I whipped together an app that had number buttons on only half the screen, so I was able to still use it.)\nI'd suggest checking the cables. Be sure that you didn't loosen anything while \"testing before refastening\". \nAlso, considering the fragile nature of both the device and the non-apple digitizer, it could be broken. If the cables are all connected, you might need to send it back to where you bought it.\n", "Q: Changing airport connection preference algorithm Airport connects to the network in order of preference that I have set. Is there a way to make it connect to the network that I was last connected to, instead of the one higher in the list.\nFor eg. I have 3 networks, in order, Wifi0, Wifi1 & Wifi2. If I am connected to Wifi1 and close the lid, open it back, it will connect to Wifi0. I want it to connect to Wifi1.\n\nA: You can set another location (also called configuration) in the Network preference panel. In the Location1 configuration, you only keep the Wifi1, and do the same with a Location2. (I know this isn't what you're searching for, but it's a workaround).\n", "Q: The caret is moved in an expected place when I add/remove a space in text I before entered in a textarea field I notice this behavior all times I move a sentence on a separate line: I delete a space character between two words with the backspace key, and the text cursor is moved to the next space; when I press Enter, the first word is left on the old line.\nIs this a bug, a feature of Safari, or neither of them? (Therefore, it is a bug in third-party software)?\n \n \n\nI noticed that something similar is still happening with OS X 10.8.3 and Safari 6.0.4: When I edit something I have written before, adding a space moves the caret to the end of the sentence I am editing. It doesn't happen all times, and I am not able to understand when it happens.\nI don't have any utility that intercepts the pressed keys or the mouse clicks; the settings for symbol and text substitution and automatically correcting the spelling are disabled.\n\n\nA: I wasn't able to reproduce this on a MacBook Air running Mac OS X 10.6.6 and Safari 5.0.3. When I press backspace (it's called delete on my keyboard), it doesn't cause the carat to jump to the next word.\nPerhaps it's some 3rd party software interfering with your keyboard?\n", "Q: \"Enter/Return\" with, or without \"Fn\" Does Mac OS X, and any Mac application, handles Fn+Enter differently from Enter?\nAs optional question, does any application handles Fn+Return differently from Return?\n\nA: \nDoes any application handle Fn+Return differently from Return?\n\nYes!  In iTunes 10.5, Return will make a highlighted song start playing but Fn+Return will allow you to rename the song.  This was revealed to me at How can I rename a song in iTunes with a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: I guess since fn+return equals enter, the fn+enter-combination would equal fn+fn+return which does not make much sense, so my vote is: no, there is no app that can receive this combo. \nTo prove, you'll need to read the key codes sent from keyboard to the system when it´s pressed (ie. Full Key Codes could do this for you)  - since I don´t have a keyboard with a physical enter I unfortunately can´t do that.\n\nA: This is not hard to find out.\nOpen vim and enter insert mode \n( Note: I just hit 'j' several times to move the cursor.

Anyone know which video cards are available/supported/will work on the Mac Pro (Original)  from December 2006 also known as MacPro1,1 in the system profiler?\n\nA: \"Available\", \"supported\", and \"will work\" are three very different things.\nThe officially compatible video cards for the original (1,1) Mac Pro are:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT\n\n*ATI Radeon X1900 XT\n\n*NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 (and family)\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT\n\n\nThese are the only cards that are supported in an original Mac Pro. Unfortunately, most are not particularly available any more. Apple no longer sells any of these cards, except the Quadro FX family (which is super-expensive and not consumer-oriented). I believe most, if not all, of the above officially supported cards are all Apple-specific variants. There are various non-Apple versions of the above, which may or may not work in a Mac Pro, depending on firmware compatibility (sometimes it is possible to program a Mac-compatible version of the firmware into a non-Apple card's non-volatile flash, thus enabling the use of a non-Apple version in the Mac Pro). But the bottom line is that it is not really possible to purchase these cards anymore (except for the super-expensive Quadro FX and maybe a small quantity of the others that can be found used on Amazon or eBay).\nThat said, there is at least one other card that is currently (as of Summer 2011) available that will work in an original Mac Pro. Although it is not listed as being officially compatible (and therefore not officially supported), there are numerous accounts in the Apple online store from customers who have reported that the ATI Radeon HD 5770 works just fine out-of-the-box in their original Mac Pros. I too purchased one from a local Apple Store and installed it in my original Mac Pro (running OS X 10.6.7), so I can state for a fact that this card does work just fine, and it doesn't require any hacking (no drivers to install, no firmware to be flashed) -- it just works right out of the box. It also performs quite a bit better than the older officially compatible cards. It also works just fine in Windows under Boot Camp (after downloading and installing the Boot Camp drivers from the ATI/AMD website).\nThe only caveat (and it is a very minor one) is that the installation instructions that accompany the card deviate somewhat from what is actually required in the original Mac Pro, due to minor variations between the internals of the older Mac Pros and the newer ones. For instance, the instructions mention sliding a PCI cage (to move a retention bracket), but the bracket is not present, and the cage doesn't move in the original Mac Pro (each PCI slot has it's own small retention \"clip\" instead). Also, the power connector on the motherboard is in a different location in the original Mac Pro.\nIf you do some research, you will find various other reports of users having success with other cards (especially various ATI Radeon variants). Oftentimes, it involves updating the firmware (flashing). However, the Radeon HD 5770 is the only currently available card I am aware of that will work out of the box.\n\nA: I can confirm, out of the Box AMD, Asus EAH 6850 DC/2DIS/1GD5, work\non Mac Pro 1.1 OS Lion 10.7.5.\nI do have Apple ATI 5770 that dose all my video editing on FCPx.\nBut looking for more GPU power.\nI should Note that a Evga GTX570 will also work, i do have some problems\nwith open gL.

I utilize the Voice Memos feature on my iPhone and have noticed a recurring problem of iTunes duplicating my recordings.  Note that the recordings appear duplicated only in iTunes and not on my iPhone.  I haven't figured out how to prevent this but have provided steps below for removing duplicates and synchronizing the proper recordings as I've found the process not very intuitive.  I appreciate any insight into the cause and/or solution for this problem.  I also welcome a simpler cleanup process.  I'd love to be shown that I'm overcomplicating this.\nMacBook Pro\nMac OS 10.6.6\niTunes 10.1.2\niPhone 3GS\niOS 4.2.1  \n\n*UPDATE*\nIt appears something has changed regarding how iTunes synchronizes Voice Memos with an iPhone in 10.2.2 because the tedious method I mapped below no longer works properly. I had to switch to managing music manually and delete all Voice Memos from my phone manually via iTunes. Then, changed back from manual manage and synched. All Voice Memos returned to my phone but not timestamped correctly. Also, iTunes changed the naming convention of all my memos to the inferior method.\nMoral of the story:  record nothing.\n\n*Make necessary backups prior to making any changes and proceed at your own risk.*\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone to computer\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Open Phone Disk (Free)\n\n*Open Finder window and select mounted drive for iPhone\n\n*Navigate to \"Recordings\" folder and copy entire contents to a folder on your desktop\n\n*Navigate to \"Macintosh HD\\Users\\YourUserName\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Music\\Voice Memos\"  and copy entire contents of \"Voice Memos\" to a separate folder on your desktop\n\n*Open iTunes and select iPhone from DEVICES category\n\n*Remove tick from \"Include voice memos\" on the Music page for you iPhone\n\n*Add tick for \"Manually manage music and videos\" from the Summary page for your iPhone\n\n*Select OK/Apply/Sync when prompted (this will not delete your recordings)\n\n*Expand iPhone under DEVICES in iTunes and select \"Voice Memos\" playlist\n\n*Delete all contents of \"Voice Memos\" playlist on iPhone\n\n*Identify duplicate Voice Memos in iTunes (this can be laborious)\nVoice Memos can be accessed from two locations in iTunes.  Your phone will be listed by name as an album in your music library regardless of whether or not your phone is connected.  iTunes also creates a \"Voice Memos\" playlist.  Deleting duplicates from a playlist will not delete audio files from your computer.\nControl+click any recording assumed to be a duplicate and select \"Show in Finder\" to review the actual file name.  It may be helpful to choose File -> Display Duplicates.\nI'm not sure why iTunes has two separate naming conventions for voice memos or how/when it chooses one over the other.  Below are examples of these naming conventions:\n20110203 183525.m4a    (preferred naming convention)\n20110203 183525 1.m4a  (duplicate)  \n2_3_11 6_35 PM.m4a     (duplicate/old naming convention)\n\nI prefer the first naming convention listed above as it allows for proper chronology listing from the year all the way down to the second.  The third convention listed above makes locating a file by date/time rather cumbersome.  The first is a much neater and efficient naming convention.\n\n*Delete all duplicate Voice Memos from iTunes and Finder (path provided above in #6)\n\n*After deleting duplicates, repeat step 6 to prevent having to sort duplicates in the case of a problem\n\n*Open Finder window and select mounted drive for iPhone\n\n*Navigate to \"Recordings\" folder and delete entire contents (first confirm backup folder on desktop is good)\n\n*Confirm Voice Memos app is closed on iPhone\nDouble tap the Home button revealing recently opened apps.  If Voice Memos app is listed touch and hold until apps begin to \"wiggle.\"  Tap the red close circle in the top left of the app icon.  Press the Home button again.\n\n*Synchronize iPhone with iTunes\n\n*Open Voice Memos app on iPhone to confirm all memos are deleted\n\n*Close Voice Memos app (see step #16)\n\n*Open iTunes and select iPhone from DEVICES category\n\n*Remove tick from \"Manually manage music and videos\" from the Summary page for your iPhone\n\n*Add tick for \"Include voice memos\" on the Music page for you iPhone\n\n*Synchronize iPhone with iTunes\n\n\nSome of these steps may be able to be omitted but after wrestling with this for a while, I decided to be thorough.  Also note that switching the tick back and forth for managing your music synchronization manually will apparently enable synchronizing movies, TV shows, and books.  So, if you don't want those synced, you'll need to uncheck those.\nAgain, any help is appreciated.  This is more work than it should be for such a stupid issue.\n\nA: I am not sure if I have resolved the issue, but I managed to delete my duplicates fairly easily by sorting them by date added and selecting all the ones that were created during a certain sync. I then sort by name or duration and pick out those that aren't duplicates. Still tedious but better than brute force\n\nA: This has happened a lot to me, and I have no idea how to get it to stop. It got so frustrating that I ended up switching to DropVox to record voice memos, and I haven't looked back.\nOnce I switched to DropVox, I moved all my memos out of iTunes, and I wrote a one-off script to delete exact duplicates. If you decide to use it, be careful - I only developed it enough to meet my needs and I never intended to distribute it.\n(Incidentally, the script will miss some duplicate files - there are cases where the same voice memo has been changed in some way so that the md5 hashes no longer match)\n\nA: Sometimes duplicated content in the library can be caused by the actual iTunes Library file having problems, as it is the database referencing all the files being created and indexed. You can check http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1451 to regenerate it. \n\nA: Those who are fine with downloading and afterwards deleting all voice memos from the iPhone, they can also use the same method like I got my safari pdf prints from Books to pc, using 3rd party apps that can read the files in the backup, where all voice memos are saved. Those apps will cost you some small amount though. Afterwards, you can delete all voice memos in your data management on the iPhone and do the organisation of your duplicates “at home”, in the “no-iTunes” environment.\nSee iphone: move (IN ONE GO!)

I have a MacBook Air Late 2010. I notice that sometimes when I press the decrease brightness button, it causes the brightness to increase and only after subsequent presses it starts to actually reduce the brightness (from this now higher brightness setting).\nI was just wondering why this happens, and if it's related at all to an ambient light sensor similar to the one that the iPhone has.\n\nA: The Air does have an ambient light sensor. Try disabling it in the Displays System Preferences pane and see if it fixes the problem.\n\nA: If the Air is not used for a while, it will dim the screen to save power. If it detects any user action, such as pressing the \"decrease brightness\" key, it will return the screen to its original brightness, and taking that one notch down because you've pressed the key will still be brighter than it was.\n\nA: You might need to \"recalibrate\" your light sensor. I do this by placing my thumb over the camera area to cover the light sensor. Then I max out the brightness. It seems to work because afterwards the brightness control works as its supposed to. \n", "Q: How to control the right browser based on used workspace? My default browser is Chromium.  I tend to use different browsers and assign them to a Space.  So for example Chromium is space 1 along with an item, Firefox in space 2 with terminal, Safari 3 with virtualbox, and so on.

So when I click on a link from some other app, it opens in the default browser in the current space, not only Chromium.\nAlso acceptable would be \"open in the browser based on space number\"  or similar.  \nHow can I make this happen?  \n\nA: You could try Choosy.\n\nA: Perhaps involving less low-level coding than my other suggestion...\nAnother possible approach would be to create your own browser and set that as the default, and your browser passes URLs off to other browsers depending on what space is the active space.\nIf you can create an Automator app or AppleScript that accepts HTML files in such a way that you can set it to be the default browser, then this solution becomes fairly easy.\nYour app can detect the current space using AppleScript. Then, just hard-code which browser the request should be forwarded to.\n\nA: I don't know of an officially supported way to do this, but if I really needed it done I would hack it together by detecting when Spaces changes spaces (hint, hint), and then change my default browser each time that happens.\n", "Q: Is there a way to test my iPhone for any potential rogue apps Is there is a way I can test my iPhone for any potential rogue apps that someone may have installed on it?

This page tells how to enable NTFS for writing from Snow Leopard.\n\nA: CrashPlan is great for Mac backup. But it dose NOT officially support NTFS Drives. There is a workaround. and I have made it work.  See here:\nhttp://support.crashplan.com/doku.php/recipe/back_up_windows_mapped_drives\n\nA: I have no experience using the Mac client at all.  So I can't say for sure whether it specifically works with an NTFS formatted drive.  But CrashPlan has a client that can theoretically do what you want for free.\n", "Q: Always prompt for Boot Device on Startup? I have a MacBook where I have to dual boot Windows and OS X. When I hold the Option Key on startup, I get the nice \"Select Boot Device\" screen.\nIs there a way to permanently enable this, so that I don't have to remember to hold option every time I restart?\n\nA: One way to do this is to install a boot loader such as rEFIt.\nThis will present you with a menu similar to the following when you start up your computer:\n\n\nA: On Intel-based Macs, this supposedly works (unverified):\nsudo nvram manufacturing-enter-picker=true\n\nNote that this reportedly is not supported on ARM-based Macs.\n", "Q: Is there an attribute that can show which process created a file? Now, I can find out which processes are opening files dynamically.

Much of what my id does should be via applications, or from a terminal.  I'd like to find out more.  Suggestions?\n\nA: Darwin is open source. I'm guessing you'll need to modify OS level things, a kernel extension, etc. and add this ability. \nOr you could modify the dynamic-view tools you know (fs_usage and/or lsof), have them check if a file is being created, and append the process chain that created it into the Spotlight comment, etc.\n", "Q: Suppress load screen when using rEFIt? I have rEFIt installed.  Is there any way to choose a default OS to launch which would in turn suppress the load screen from showing up when you start up the computer?\nI'm looking for a way to make it more like the native boot loader of Mac OS X's. Where by default it will launch the last OS you ran without showing you the menu. The menu will only be shown if you hold down option while the computer starts up.\nIf there's no way to do this, is there a way to customize the time it automatically selects the OS to boot? That is, by default I believe you have 20 seconds to choose an OS. Failure to do so will cause the highlighted OS to launch. I would like to change this 20 second interval to something like 2 seconds.\n\nA: At the moment there is no such option in rEFIt. It has been requested, but there has been no acknowledgement of implementing it.\nYou could always participate in developing the application and thus getting the feature implemented :)\n\nA: With version 0.7.8 (if not earlier), OS boot timeout has been implemented in rEFInd. Download the package, run ./install.sh, and then edit the configuration file at /EFI/refind/refind.conf.\nIt also supports hiding of the menu, but I don't think it can launch the last OS you selected.\n", "Q: Running flash on MacBook Air V1 I run applications that use Adobe Flash.\nThis causes my MacBook Air (1st generation) to heat up and end up becoming unusable. \nSomeone suggested running flash after creating a new Windows Partition, because Mac OS-X does not support Flash very well.\nWill it help to run Flash that way?\n\nA: I have found that Parallels and VMWare are painfully slow on a 1st gen MBA. You could use Chrome when you need Flash as it runs a browser-specific instance of Flash rather than calling the system Flash instance. Flash is very CPU-intensive so it may very well heat up the machine more than normal — I seem to recall mine always being pretty hot on the bottom.\nJohn Gruber has a great article on removing Flash from OS X and then just using Chrome when you need it here - http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome\n\nA: It's actually Flash that does't support OS X very well.\nBut simply running Flash can't make your MBA so hot, what kind of applications are you using with Flash that demand such huge heat-ups?\nYou could try installing a Windows partition, but I suspect that it won't lessen your problem.\nI think your problem are the applications oyu are using with that laptop, as it doesn't have active cooling and can't handle too much CPU/GPU heat.\n", "Q: Swap key €->$ permanently I have a Macbook Air with a Swedish keyboard and when I type Shift+4 I get this: €.

They work if I change the User Agent to Safari 4.0.3 using the Developer menu, but this is not permanent.\nFlash Player 10.1 is no longer downloadable, so I don't know how to downgrade. User agent setting are not permanent, or I don't know how to set them fixed.\nMaybe, it is a bug in YouTube embedding, because Flash sites like that from Adobe work. I am relativly sure that the new flash plugin is the problem, because I have to macbooks with OS X 10.6.6 and Safari 5.0.3. The only difference if the version of the flash plugin: 10.1 shows youtube videos, 10.2 not.\nI'm not sure the flash version is the reason. ALso the working mac has been installed with OS X 10.6 from scratch, the not working has been updated from an 10.5.\n\nA: I had this problem while running ClickToFlash 1.6b9 (the original general browser plug-in, not the Safari 5.x extension). Even with ClickToFlash  disabled via the checkbox in ClickToFlash's preferences, it still happened. I ended up dragging the ClickToFlash plug-in out of /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ and restarting Safari, and it went away.\n\nA: Try to start Safari in 32Bit mode (right click on it, chose \"information\" and check \"32-bit mode\". \nAnother idea: uninstall flash completely so safari should display HTML5 videos in youtube without a plugin.\nHope, that helps!\n\nA: I can't fix the bad version of Flash that you have, but I can offer a solution to get YouTube working. YouTube supports formats other than Flash. If you are using Safari, download and install this Safari 5 Plugin called YouTube5\nOnce this extension is installed in Safari 5, when you go to the YouTube site, instead of getting flash videos you get a custom HTML5 player. Works great and I don't miss flash.\nHere is a screen shot of how I have it setup in my Safari 5 Extensions panel of Preferences.\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Toggle Ink's WriteAnywhere with AppleScript How can you easily toggle the Ink preference pane setting \"Write Anywhere\"?\n\nA: With this script you can toggle the Write Anywhere setting on and off, however it opens the System Preferences in the background:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal (pane id \"com.apple.preference.ink\")\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n            tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n                click checkbox \"Allow me to Ink in any application\" of group 1 of tab group 1 of window \"Ink\"\n            end tell\nend tell\n\nI use it for toggling WriteAnywhere from the \"Radial Menu\" of my Wacom tablet.\n", "Q: The browser doesn't show videos on Youtube Today I noticed that Safari doesn't show anymore the videos shown on Youtube; I just see a black rectangle, and when I try to use the popup menu in that area, it doesn't appear.\nAs far as I can remember, one week ago I was able to see videos on Youtube. Something is changed in this week; for what I can remember, Safari has not been updated, in these days.\nHow can I find the reason of the problem, and eventually resolve it?\n\nA: I have the same problem and the only solution I have in the moment is to change the User Agent using the Developer Menu. Safari 4.1.3 - Mac works for me. But this is not permanent! You have to change it every time yu start Safari :-(\n\nA: Are you using flash or html5 youtube?\nI recommend to try the html5 version, if you are not using it already.\n\nA: Could it be that Adobe Flash has crashed? Are you running the latest version? \nAlso in this time have you restarted Safari/your Mac? If not that may get Flash working again.\n", "Q: Tablets and SSD degradation Does the iPad use any type of controller for drive wear leveling? It seems like Sandforce is the only player in the field. \n\nA: Apple iPad does not use an SSD. It uses a flash based drive. \nUPDATE: In response to the differences between SSD's and Flash Drives, here is the following excerpt explaining the difference.\n\n‘Flash Drives’ are a generic term which used for anything from USB memory sticks to SSDs. An USB flash drive uses lower quality low performance NAND flash with just 1 or 2 channels. Its durable, cheap but slow. An SSD on the other hand uses high performance NAND with mutliple channels. ( 12 or 8 is not uncommon), and there is a  memory controller on a SSD which is much better and both can store data even if its not powered.\nFlash drives (USB) are slow storage devices where as SSDs are high performance drives. They’re much faster than normal HDDs.\nA USB flash drive uses USB, which is generally a slower interface than the Serial ATA interface. A USB flash drive is generally thought of as a removable device by the OS and is managed as such. A SSD is treated similarly to a hard drive, and is often recognized by your OS as a type of fixed disk.\nUSB flash drives and solid-state drives are both based on flash memory. Most of the flash memory use  NAND memory, which are available as single-level cells (SLC) and multi-level cells (MLC). Single-level cells store a single bit in a single memory cell, whereas multi-level cells store more than a single bit in a single memory cell. The MLC accomplishes this by allowing each memory cell to store multiple electrical states, therefore, allow one MLC cell to store more information than one SLC cell. For example, a MLC that uses 4-levels can store 2 bits of information.  MLC are cheaper, as they can store more information per memory cell than SLC. Cheap, large SSDs and USB flash memory use MLC disks, although not necessarily. MLCs sounds great in terms of storage density, but it does have a catch. MLCs are  slower than SLC. Therefore, the large capacity USB flash drives and SSDs tend to be slower. Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have no moving parts, high reliability and longer life-span than traditional hard drives\nTaken from here\n\nA: This isn't a big concern since you will likely be writing to flash less than you would on a desktop.  Streaming video will go to DRAM.  I'm an electrical engineer who uses flash and I would be ok buying an iPad; I expect the battery will fail long before the flash.  Additionally when a sector goes bad, it will be skipped on future writes.\n\nA: Whether Flash is used in an SSD (SATA interface) or just as a Flash memory hanging off any other internal bus, the Flash wearing out issues are the same. Unless Apple has done something in system software to minimize write cycles (caching schemes?) the wearing out risks are real and only Apple can explain how it is mitigating it. Yes, SandForce controller is the only one that claims Write cycle reduction and thus extend the Flash endurance by minimizing the write cycles.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set a Custom quick look preview image in OS X? Is there any way to set a custom quick look image in OS X? I'd like a command line tool or applescript to change or embed a custom preview for a file using a jpeg.\n\nA: No. The way Quick Look works is that a plugin, which recognizes your file, is required. Only such plugins can supply images to QL.\n", "Q: How to interact with programs when names read from a list I have a script which checks for loads of applications if they are open, and closes them if yes, and opens them if not.\nUntil now I had a simple:\ntell application \"System Events\"\nif exists (process \"Caffeine\") then\n    tell application \"Caffeine\" to quit\nelse\n    tell application \"Caffeine\" to activate\nend if\n...\nend tell\n\nTo go through the programs. Today I had to edit some programs and I figured \"this could be so much simpler with an array and a for-loop\"\nSo I tried this:\nset theList to {\"Caffeine\", ...}\ntell application \"System Events\"\nrepeat with prog in theList\n    if exists (process prog) then\n        tell application prog to quit\n    else\n        tell application prog to activate\n    end if\nend repeat\nend tell\n\nBut now for some reason I get an error, each time I run the script: \n\nerror \"System Events got an error: Connection is invalid.\" number -609  \n\nThe error pops-up always from a different point in the script.\nI'm really confused why this doesn't work.\nCan anybody assist me in getting this to work?  \n\nA: \"Connection is invalid\" means that the script cannot communicate with the application. Perhaps it has been quit during execution… perhaps there is a duplication in your list? My best guess is that there is more than one process spawned by an application.\nAnyway, I think your methodology could be improved. One of your problems is that you're checking the process for each item in your list. You should compile a list of processes, and check that. This avoids the problem of duplicate processes for the same application. It also deals with the issue of the process list changing during script execution.\nset appList to {\"Caffeine\", ...}\n\ntell application \"System Events\" \n    set procList to (name of every process)\nend tell\n\nrepeat with appName in appList\n    if (procList contains appName) is true then\n        tell application appName to quit\n    else\n        tell application appName to activate\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nIf you still get errors, you might have to enclose the tell application statements in try blocks.\nOne more thing: the approach you're taking doesn't work well if only some of the applications are open, and some are not. You're checking each individually and quitting if it's open, launching if it's not. So your list of applications will still be split between open/shut down. It sounds like you want to open a \"set\" of applications and close a \"set\" of applications using the same script.\nTherefore, you may want to consider splitting this into two scripts, \"open set\" and \"quit set\", and/or checking whether your \"main\" application is open and cascading the open/close of your application list depending on that one application's state.\n", "Q: Free OS X utility to scrape web sites? I want to scrape all the pages and subpages of a web site (by scrape, I mean save all the online content to local HTML files).\nWhat is the best utility to crawl all the pages?

Can I stream video to an Apple TV without using iTunes? iTunes is good, but if I can have another way to stream video, it would be great.\n\nA: Indeed there is. You can try AirFlick - it encodes video on the fly and sends it straight to your AppleTV. I've used it for a while now, and although it can be a little unstable from time to time, it really is very useful.\nOf course, you could always install XBMC following this guide and control it, play all sorts of video, and make tons on neat customizations however you see fit.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Airvideo is another option, but requires another iOS device to act as an intermediary between the atv and the machine where your video is stored.\n\nA: Firecore is brilliant, it allows almost any sort of video to be streamed from a networked drive directly to the ATV without the need for ANY intermediary device (I have only tried it with a Time Capsule). BUT it requires a jailbroken ATV and is currently in Beta. Easy install with a very simple bundled jailbreak package. Still, does away with the need for iTunes or an 'always-on' computer.\n\nA: I use Beamer ($19.99, free trial). It's got a flat, Yosemite-native theme, and is 100% reliable if your network and the AppleTV on it are configured correctly. Dragging files to the Beamer icon will immediately start playback on the AppleTV.\nIt works with every format except WMV that I've run into thus far, including DivX, MKV, and all the native video types. In addition, you can play, pause and scan using either the AppleTV IR remote or the app window, which I thought was a pretty nice feature.\n\nA: If you have an iPad, it can stream to an Apple TV via AirPlay.\nAirPlay works with any app that supports it, including Video, Pictures, YouTube, and others. I've even seen workout apps that stream how-to videos.\n\nA: For those who live outside US like me, you can access Netflix, Hulu and similar media stations on your Apple TV by using UnoTelly or similar tools.\n", "Q: Mac os X - locked outside my account (language!) Today I was cleaning my MacBook keyboard (OSX 10.6.6) while the user was locked.\nDue to some random key-presses, the language of the login changed from English to Hebrew (I use both in MAC, but only English for login).\nWhen in the login menu, the cmd-space shortcut has not effect, and it does not change the language.\nI didn't have any way to change it, and was practically locked outside my account.\nWhat is the magical key-sequence that can change the language back to English?\n(for completeness - I did a hard reboot, which brought me back to the main login screen, and luckily the language reverted back to English...\nNow I have changed the login preferences so that the language selection appears in the login screen anyhow, but the question is very important for anyone who found himself locked out.)\nsee also\nQuestion in superuser stackexchange\nand also This Question, that is very useful if you are not already locked - so you can set the language drop-menu to appear also in the login menu.\n\nA: This adds the language selection to the login window:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.\n\n*Click Users & Groups to display the pane (or choose User & Groups from the View menu).\n\n*If the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the window is closed, click it, then enter the name and password of an administrator to unlock it.\n\n*Click Login Options.\n\n*Select the \"Show Input menu in login window\" checkbox.\n\n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4099\n\nA: The keyboard shortcut is customizable, just as almost any other action.\nThe place to customize and thus find the shortcut is:\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Keyboard & Text Inputs > \"Select previous input source\" & \"Select next source in Input menu\"\n\nThese are cmd+space and opt+cmd+space as defaults on my OS X 10.6.6\n\nA: A Heard reboot might not always help.\nClick on \"Guest\", it will boot up a new window.\nYoull see all users and \"guest\"\nClick (not tap) on your account\nEnter your password (by default, the language is English)\n", "Q: Hiding home shares on file sharing computer Due to my email backup software, I had to create 'real' users on my 10.6.6 install rather that create 'share only' users.\nNow when users connect to the shares, they see a full home folder as well as the shares I have setup.  \nIs there a way for me to turn off sharing home folders?\nEDIT:\nWhen a user logs onto the server, I only want them to see the assigned shares, not the automatically made 'home folder' share.  For instance, I make a user on the server called 'Bob', and three shares called \"One', 'Two', 'Three'.  When Bob logs onto the server from another computer via finders 'SHARED' list, he sees four shares 'Bob', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', I do not want 'Bob' to show up on that list.\n\nA: If you set up their accounts in the Accounts pref pane on the server as \"sharing only\" then they will only get access to shared folders set up in the Sharing pane of System Preferences.\nSee the Apple docs on creating a sharing only account.\nSince you say the email backup software requires that the user has real folders, then you can't remove them as \"shares\", they have full access to these folders and the server will advertise that.\nWithout knowing why the email software requires the user to have folders then a workaround is difficult to find.\n\nA: I'm not sure if I understand your question :)\nThere is an option to select which folders are shared, in:\n\nSystem Prefences > Sharing > File Sharing\n\n\nA: This is the behavior of the server one connects to when a home directory is specified in the local user database.  So, my local account is created and by default I have a home folder.  When I connect to that server remotely, it will present me with that home directory as a Sharepoint.\nYou can go into Workgroup Manager, select the user, and select the \"Home\" tab/button.  You should have a few options there, one of which is \"none.\"  Select that and the user will no longer see a home directory when connecting to the server. \nThe only problem with this is the Preferences User & Groups app isn't smart enough to figure out this was done in workgroup manager, and it prevents you from looking at the Advanced Options for the user.  Shouldn't be a big deal if you have WM though. \nt\n", "Q: Why are my Macbook's internal speakers not available? My Macbook (the unibody aluminum version) has lost its internal speakers. When I open System Preferences -> Sound -> Output, all I see is \"Digital Out\". If I plug in a pair of headphones, this switches to \"Headphones\". I don't see \"Internal Speakers\" at all any more. Headphones seem to work fine.\nIn System Profiler -> Audio -> Available Devices, I do see \"Speaker: Connection: Internal\". \nI just clean-installed Snow Leopard, so it appears to be a hardware problem.\nIs there anything I can do to fix this, short of taking it back to Apple? It's out of warranty.\n\nA: Samething here, I plugged in my headphones and jiggled them a little bit while inside and then pulled them out halfway.  Once I did that I could see the volume slider appear and the volume could be adjusted up and down.  I pulled them out all the way and they volume went grey again.  Pushed the headphones back in and then pulled them out and now everything is fine.\n\nA: I had this problem and solved it by plugging in (and then unplugging) my iPod headphones. \n\nA: If you look in your headphones jack, is there a red light on?\nIf yes, then you have Digital Out on, and this messes with the speaker configuration.\nThere is a thread here, which has some possible fixes.\nUpdate\nThere is switch inside the jack that is stuck.  Plug the speaker jack in and out several times while watching the Sound-output system preference panel.  The internal speaker option will come on if the switch is unstuck. \nTaking a toothpick and fiddling around inside the jack has solved the problem for some, you should try this. (Don't break the toothpick inside :) )\nFrom: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=239287\n\nThe problem is actually caused by a little switch inside the jack that gets stuck. When you stick in an audio cable, it pushes the switch down. If it's an analog cable, the end is made of metal. If it's optical, the end is made of plastic. If the switch is pressed down, the computer checks to see if the plug inside is metal or plastic based on conductivity. When it gets stuck and nothing is in there, it thinks an optical cable is plugged in since the switch is down but nothing conductive is in there. That's why it works with headphones or external analog speakers.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue but with most likely a different cause to the other answers. None of the above helped me. I also couldn't get sound through HDMI and I didn't even have a Big Sur boot chime from the UEFI.\nI fixed the issue by resetting the SMC (shut down, hold power button for 10 seconds, release, press power button again to boot up).\nHope this helps someone at some point.\n", "Q: Is there a way to add To-Do's to iCal from the iPhone?

I realise there are dozens of photo-sharing sites, but I'm looking for something that has\n\n\n*\n\n*native iPad compatibility\n\n*syncing / auto-download\n\n*offline viewing\n\n*access control\n\n*simple interface\n\n\nThis is aimed at grandparents keeping in touch with their new grandbabies, so simplicity is important. The offline viewing is also key as I expect they will want to take their iPad on the go as a 'brag book' to share with friends when/where internet is not available (or too slow).\nOne option is MobileMe Gallery. I'm not crazy about the subscription fee, but it is acceptable. It caches photos when they are viewed which is acceptable, but not as great as sync / auto-download of new photos.\nI've also checked out Dropbox which has the advantage of not requiring a subscription fee. It caches photos on the iPad the same as MobileMe Gallery. But it doesn't have an easy export from iPhoto which is a drawback. \nThe questions are... Is MobileMe Gallery fit for purpose? Are there alternatives? Are there better solutions?\n\nA: Dropbox would probably do this. Or at least some of this. \nIt is possible to set up several Dropbox accounts (i.e., one for you and one for different family members) and share folders between those accounts. This would enable you to upload photos and they would be shared immediately in the shared folder. \nDropbox provides a Photos folder which can be organised into a web album for viewing via the web page or in the iOS app. The most recent release of the iOS app has just included photo cacheing so that it doesn't need to be online to show photos. \nNot entirely sure that this would be a great solution but it might solve some of the issues. Also, not entirely sure that the sharing and photo features work quite as I have described but would be worth experimenting with.\n\nThis link explains how to set it up: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/quickly-set-share-beautiful-photo-galleries-dropbox/\n\nA: Perhaps the most awkward answer, but this is how I do it. I view the photo online and take a screen grab of it.\n\nA: Picasa from Google might solve this. Picasa offers a Mac application which allows you to easily upload photos stored in your iPhoto library to the Picasa web site. They can either be made private, public or shared with friends.\nThere are also a number of iPhone/iPad apps that can be used to access Picasa. They seem to all be third-party apps and seem to charge and I can't really comment on the quality of any of them.\n\nA: I've used MobileMe Gallery for the last year which ticked most of the boxes.  However, with it coming to an end, I've had to reevaluate my solution and thought I'd update this question with my latest answer. \nI've gone with Flickr as a photosharing service and the FlickStackr iPad app.\nOne of the primary reasons for selecting Flickr was the integration with iPhoto. It makes it easy to upload and manage albums. Flickr is also a robust and powerful service with API access allowing other developers to write apps that use the service which provides many options. I evaluated many apps and selected FlickStackr primarily for its offline capabilities. It will queue up and automatically download photos and display them without issue while offline. \n\nA: There are two great apps that do this for you, one is called CameraSync the other is called PhotoSync. Sorry you'll have to search the app store for them as im on my phone so I can't copy the links (maybe someone will be good enough to edit this answer and add the links).\nAnyway, they both sync photos to your iPad and they're made even better as they both sync with services like Picasa and Dropbox! Meaning you can use Picasa or Dropbox on you computer to sync and use one of these two apps on your iPad.\n", "Q: Does Adobe Photoshop CS (version 8) run on Snow Leopard?

Rosetta is needed to run PowerPC applications on Intel Macs.\nYou can install Rosetta from the Snow Leopard disk. I believe you will be prompted to do this when you try to run Photoshop.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade from Mac OS X Tiger 10.4? If I buy a regular retail Snow Leopard disc (i.e. the £25 version), can I use it to upgrade a Mac from Tiger (10.4)?\nThis answer on the Apple Store’s Q&A site suggests it’ll work, but Apple seem to imply that you need the (significantly more expensive) Mac Box Set (“the Mac Box Set is the best way to upgrade your Mac experience, especially if you're still using Mac OS X Tiger.”).\n\nA: Apple wants you to buy the Box Set in order to upgrade from Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 to Snow Leopard. Technically, you the Snow Leopard retail package will upgrade intel based Macs running Mac OS X Tiger 10.4, however it is against the terms of the End User License Agreement (EULA).\nThe Box Set includes additional software that typically comes with a new Mac (and some that doesn't) and it is recommended by Apple to 'upgrade your Mac experience' because it is more like buying a new Mac than just upgrading the operating system.\nTo hear it straight from Apple, here are the answers from Alan Eyzaguire, director of software product marketing at Apple Europe to this question.\n\n\"We just think that Apple customers could really benefit from having those. They're great software.\"\n\"it's great when people get the full experience\"\n\"if you have Snow Leopard it's great to have the latest iWork and iLife\"\n\"we wanted to make that [upgrade] as attractive as possible\"\n\"you get it almost for free\"\n\"it's a steal!\"\n\"Technically, yes, it would upgrade a Tiger install, but in the licensing, no.\" (citation)\n\n\nA: My suggestion is not to upgrade this way.  Back up your data manually, and do a manual restoration after reformatting your hard-drive, and doing a clean install of Snow Leopard.  As a tech, I've seen these migrations go sideways more times than I care to admit.\n", "Q: How to set a refresh rate in a Subscribed Calendar using the ical on the iPhone / iPod Touch / iPad how can I set the refresh rate?\nor does it pick the refresh rate that I had set up in the Mac iCal App?\nIf no refresh rate was given in the Mac iCal App, what is the default refresh rate? 30 minutes?\n\nA: In \"Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Fetch New Data\" you can setup what to do. Depending on the account you can Fetch or Push updates to your iPhone - or choose to do it manually.\n\nA: As of 2019/iOS 12.3.1, these settings are under Passwords and Accounts → Fetch New Data → Fetch. It looks like fetch settings are applied globally to all fetch accounts - you can't set different fetch options for individual calendars or mail accounts.\n\nA: When viewing Calendar, click on Calendars button in top left.\nDown at bottom left corner you'll see the refresh circular arrow.  Click it and it will refresh all subscribed calendars.\n\nA: I can't find any option to set refresh rate's of calendars on my iPhone.\nI checked my Google Calendar subscription in iCal and it had refresh of 15 minutes as default value. This value might vary depending on the provider of the calendar.\nBut AFAIK, calendars on iPhone don't refresh unless synced from iTunes.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 restarts every 3 min My iPhone 4 restarts itself exactly every 3 min, whether I use it or not (screen off). More precisely, it's respringing its springboard; I don't need to unlock my SIM card after each respring. Seems like a software issue as it restarts at such precise intervals, but a firmware restore has not helped.\nWorth mentioning is that it's running iOS 4.2.1 jailbroken, and the problem started after a color swap I did myself. Everything else (all the hardware parts including cameras, antennas, Wi-Fi, etc.) works just fine—which makes it hard to believe that this problem would occur only because of opening the iPhone up. Because of all this, I can't rely on my warranty, so returning the phone is not an alternative.\n\nA: Did your iPhone was jailbroken before the color swap?\nIf so, I'm afraid you broke something inside the phone. Something the OS is trying to access and since it's broken, respring the springboard (maybe that's a bug, but since you're not supposed to fiddle with the inside of the phone, it's not something you could use to replace it).\nAs a last resort, you could try to reopen it and see if there's anything that looks broken.\n\nA: In my case it was the battery. I got a friend to lend me his iPhone and after switching the batteries, the problem was gone. Thus, make sure there aren't any scratches on the battery or the battery cable.\n\nA: You said you did a firmware restore, what I believe is like a hard reset and having all software and firmware brand new and even without jailbreaking it still shows same issue - restarting every 3 minutes.\nSo it must be a hardware issue and you'd have to send it to repair. Replace possible broken parts, figure out which one is the culprit and fix it. That's a lot of work but there's not much else that could be done, unless whoever opened the iPhone knew exactly what as done and then you could optimize which parts to try out. Yes, this can cost you good money both for the replaced parts and the labor work.\nIn the small chance that it turns out to be some part not related to damage caused by opening it, I would try to repack everything as new and returning the phone to warranty.\nFair is fair.\nIf you ask me and I'd have opened my iPhone and then broken it, I'd save my self the headache sell it to someone who do handle this stuff and buy me a new one.\n", "Q: What is the best way to set up multiple iPod / iPhones on the same computer? I have an iPod sync and my wife just got an iPhone.  Before I set up her iPhone, I want to make sure I don't mess anything up.  I have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I create a separate Apple ID for her, or have her use my id?\n\n*Is there anything else I need to worry about to make sure it recognizes her account and sync info and mine and doesn't get confused?\n\n\nI see a few horror stories on the web and just want to make sure I do this right.\n\nA: You can do the Apple ID any way you like. If you use the same ID on both devices, then you can sync all the Purchased apps to both devices.\nI'm using my iTunes to manage and backup the iPhone of my girlfriend and my iPhone. We have separate ID's and iTunes never got confused.\nUpdate\nOh and remember, if you setup up separate ID's then you still can sync all apps from both accounts, but you can't update the apps from your Wife's account on your iPhone, because your phone is set to your account.\nThis can be avoided by updating all apps through iTunes, though.\n\nA: While there are (too) many ways to setup multiple iDevices on the same machine, the simplest way and most headache free is having a single account on all devices synced to the same machine. That way you can sync everything everywhere easily.\nIf you want to have separate accounts, set separate users on the machine and then you can setup different iTunes/Apple accounts on each computer user. But that will give issues with syncing contents. Apple is not very good with sharing content with other people - but they're trying to get better on it at least with family members.\n\nA: For me, the least confusing way is to setup both separate iTunes accounts and separate computer logins for both people. That way \"your\" iTunes will only see your iPad and know about your iTunes account, applications, data, etc. and \"her\" iTunes will only see her iPhone and know about her iTunes account, applications, data, etc.\nThis also gives both of you your own space on the computer -- not to keep secrets, right -- but so you can have your stuff organized and she can have her stuff organized.\n", "Q: itunes seems to sync my wife's iphone with  all of MY apps my wife just got an iphone and she did her first sync and its syncing all of my applications (i have an ipod touch).  Is there anyway to have us sync to a separate list of apps? \nif i delete these apps off my wife's iphone, are they going to be removed from itunes (and then my ipod next time i sync ?? )\n\nA: Anything removed from an iOS device is not removed form iTunes.\nSecondly, iTunes sync's all apps that are specified to sync, no matter whose App it is.\niTunes determines the owner to be the Apple ID, which downloaded the App.\nHere is an example o the app sync window:\n\nHere you can choose the apps to sync. And remember it will upload apps belonging to either of you, but it won't change ownership of them.\n\nA: I am assuming that you have one account on the machine with iTunes. @deiga is correct. It will sync all apps that are selected regardless of who \"owns\" them.\nA way around this that may work is separate logins on the machine. On either Mac or Windows, you just create a separate user account and then login as you and 'your' instance of iTunes. I have not tried this on Windows but it works fine on a mac. \n", "Q: Installation failed when attempting to reinstall MySQL in OS X 10.6.6 I had earlier installed mysql-5.1.50-osx10.6-x86_64.dmg and then uninstalled it using the below command (found on Stack Overflow):  \n$ sudo rm /usr/local/mysql  \n$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*\n$ sudo rm -rf Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM   \n$ sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*   \n$ rm -rf ~/Library/PreferencePanes/My*   \n$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*   \n$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*   \n$ sudo vi /etc/hostconfig   \n$ sudo rm -rf /var/db/receipts/com.mysql.mysql*   \n$ cd /Library/Receipts/\n\nThen I have tried to reinstall from mysql-5.5.9-osx10.6-x86_64.dmg.\nHowever I am getting the following error:\n\nThe installation failed\n  The installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.\n\n\nA: This might be a little late, but Homebrew for Macintosh is a stellar way to install software such as mysql. There is information on the their wiki on how to install and then once brew is installed, it is just brew install mysql in your terminal window.\nGood luck!\nUpdate: DOH. I fail at reading. Problem already solved. Anyway, for people in the future, if you have trouble installing mysql, give brew a try.\n\nA: Try to install MySql from the CD that come with your computer. It is part of apple developer tools. Once that is installed, try to install the dmg you downloaded from the official site. \n\nA: I am able to instal MySQL at last. Details can be found @\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5067787/re-install-mysql-in-mac-os-x-10-6-6\n", "Q: Keeping the dock visible without affecting window size? Is there any way to keep the dock visible without it affecting the size of windows?\nOn my MBP 13\" I have the dock hidden since it simply takes to much screen real estate, but working with a tablet I feel the need to have it visible at times. And I don't want to hide/unhide with a shortcut, I just want it to show on top of my windows.\n\nA: Most apps dont allow that. Some, like excel, allow you to resize the window as you like... even if you dont like the shortcut, you can use it to achieve what you are looking for... although its not very convenient.. you can hide the dock, maximize the window and then unhide it.. it will show ontop of the window.\n", "Q: iPhone Dead, No Charger Someone dropped their iPhone near my door. The neighbor picked it up, phoned me, and told me it has my number in it so it's probably someone I know.\nBut now, the phone is dead, and I don't have an iPhone charger to charge it. How can I turn this thing on?\n\nA: Go to the nearest Apple store and ask to use one of their chargers. From my previous experiences, they are usually very helpful.\n\nA: As popular as iDevices are I would think that you would be able to find someone with one that is close by... heck I can think of 5 people at work, off the top of my head plus myself...\n", "Q: Is \"ignore volume ownership\" the default for non-system partitions? I realise it is the default for external drives but not sure about other partitions on a users system drive. I don't have separate partitions on my machine so I can't look for myself ;-)\n\nA: I only have an NTFS partition next to my HFS+ partition, so I can't verify this. But all my external's have \"ignore volume ownership\" disabled and I'm pretty sure I didn't set those.\nWhy do you need to know this? It's hard to help without some background information.\n\nA: I haven't tested this properly, but my impression is that it defaults to respecting ownership on internal drives (including additional partitions on the boot drive), and ignoring ownership on external drives.  I do not know exactly how it makes the distinction.  My guess would be that it's based on whether the drive was present at boot, or attached later, but I could easily be wrong about that.\nIn any case, the default can be changed with the Finder's Get Info window, or the diskutil  or vsdbutil commands.\n\nA: From OS X Support Essentials 10.6:\n\"The Mac considers any locally mounted volume that is not the system volume to be an external volume.  Thus, other partitions on your internal system disks will still be considered external volumes.\"\n", "Q: deactivate growlmail rss notification Is it possible to tell growlmail to stop notifying me on RSS feeds and just show me the new mails I get?\nIt is getting really disturbing when I get some 30 or more RSS Notifiers when I'm working!\n\nA: If you want just notifications on the new mails you have in your Inbox(es), then there is a setting for that in GrowlMail configuration tab. Not in Growl System Preferences, but in Mail.app Growl Mail preferences.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of multiple “purchased on ” playlists? When I got my first iPhone and bought something via the iTunes app, I got a playlist in the iTunes source list underneath the “Store” heading for all the songs I purchased on the iPhone.\nI’ve had a few more iPhones since then, and each phone has also been given its own “Purchased on” playlist in iTunes. They’re now taking up quite a lot of space in the iTunes menu.\nIs there any way I can consolidate, or just get rid of, these playlists?\n\nA: You can't consolidate them, but you can delete them. Just right click and click \"Delete\".\n\nA: To consolidate them into one play list, you need to go into the other otherplay lists, slect all the tracks, then you can right click and select \"Add to playlist\" and select one of the other \"Purchased on iPhone...\" playlists, repeat for all the extra playlists, then when they are consolidated delete the spare ones.\nA similar process is detailed in this Apple KB.\n", "Q: Does the developer of a Mac OS X app get the crash reports when the app crashes? If an app crashes while I'm using it in OS X I get a little (apparently) OS-driven dialog that lets me \"report the crash to Apple\". It sends along a stack trace and some other system information. \nDoes this crash information get shared with the app developer of the app in question at the time the crash occurred?\n\nA: Mac OS X Reference Library Technical Note TN2123 states:\n\nCrashReporter performs two useful\n  actions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*When a program crashes, CrashReporter will record a crash log\n  (typically into\n  ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/), and\n  inform the user by logging a message\n  to the system logging facility.\n  \n*In addition, if the program that crashed is running as a logged in GUI\n  user, CrashReporter will present the\n  user with a dialog asking them whether\n  they want to submit a bug report to\n  Apple (see Figure 1). If the user\n  clicks the Report button,\n  CrashReporter displays another dialog\n  that shows the details of the report\n  (see Figure 2) and allows them to\n  comment it before submission.\n  \n\nAnd not much further along, states:\n\nIn this technote I explain how to interpret crash logs that you have obtained from end users.\n\nI believe this implies that the information is not automatically shared with the developer.  The developer needs to \"obtain\" the crash logs from the end users' ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/ folder.\n\nA: Recently announced by Apple (Dec. 17, 2010), the iTunes Developer Guide [PDF] illustrates how a Mac App Store developer may receive crash log reports for their apps. This isn't true for apps downloaded outside of the Mac App Store, unless the developer has coded that functionality in manually.\n\nA: I think Apple is currently preparing a system for developers of apps in the Mac App Store.\nThe iTunes Connect interface already shows a \"Crash Logs\" button, so I guess it will be possible this year.\n\nA: The crash reports seem available in the Crashes organizer. See the guide Analyzing Crash Reports for details.\n", "Q: What could cause this sporadic cursor problem? I've got this problem where my cursor is jumping left and right all on it's own. I'm not touching the computer at all, I've rebooted the system, and the only way to get it to stop is to use a mouse and disable the trackpad when a mouse is connected.\nHere is a video showing the problem\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXUGwhv7h8I\n\nA: Seems I had damp fingers when using the trackpad. Caused the sporadic issues for about 3 days. Then it all went away.\n\nA: Unexpected input when the trackpad is enabled? Unfortunately, it seems like physical damage to me. Aside from giving the trackpad a rigorous cleaning, I don't think there's much that can be done without voiding your warranty. I'd recommend taking it into an Apple store and getting it checked out by a hardware tech.\n", "Q: OS X menubar/dashboard/dock utility for monitoring a server? Is there any desktop utility for OS X that would periodically monitor a (non-osx) server and display a status icon?  Something as simple as attempting to visit a URL every 5 minutes and turning red if it does not respond would be enough, although anything more detailed is interesting too.\n\nA: GeekTool (free)\nGeekTool will let you set up a simple icon or show more detailed information, embedded in or floating over your desktop, based on whatever programming you want. \nIf you can write a script to check the server and return either a binary status or more detailed information, GeekTool is the way to display it.\n\nA: ServerSiren ($15 with 10 day free trial)\n\nWith Server Siren, server downtime is a thing of the past. It runs as a menu bar item, so a quick glance is all it takes to see that everything is A-OK. If a server goes down, Server Siren alerts you immediately so you can fix the problem and get your site up and running again.\n\n", "Q: Sending push notification to iPhone via AppleScript Is there any combination of iPhone and/or Mac apps that I can use to send a push notification to my iPhone?\nFor example, let's say I want to create a service (invoked via (Application Name) > Services) which sends the highlighted text on my Mac to my iPhone as a push notification message.\n\nA: I think a combination of Growl (OS X notifier) and Prowl (an iPhone app that forwards Push Notifcations from Growl) with your AppleScript interacting with Growl directly would be the way to go for this.\n\nA: The free app Boxcar allows you to forward Growl notifications to your iPhone. You can also use their API to send custom push notifications from any app or script. I use it with Growl (never used their API, though) and it works great.\n\nA: *\n\n*Register at Prowl\n\n*Install the Prowl iOS app on your iPhone\n\n*Use this script in OSX ('sendClipboardAsPush.sh') to send your clipboard to your iPhone as push notification:\n\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nset -x\n# Posts growl notifications to iOS device using prowl & curl\n\n# Fill in with your own Prowl API key here and remove 123456789\nAPIKEY=123456789\n# Make up a cache filename in /tmp/ based on our PID\nCACHE=/tmp/$$.cache.txt\n\n# clipboard -> temp file CACHE\npbpaste > $CACHE\n\n# Post notification to Prowl using curl\ncurl --globoff https://api.prowlapp.com/publicapi/add \\\n  -F apikey=$APIKEY \\\n  -F application=RSS \\\n  -F event=\"\" \\\n  -F description=\"`cat $CACHE`\"\n\nrm $CACHE\n\n\nYou can find your Prowl API key here.\n\nA: I would just like to point out that I recently wrote a script, and have it posted at http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=41045\n\nA: Yes, agreed, thank you for note:\nThe original intent was to link to that thread, since this was the first hit in google, and I had a solution \nI have recently written an applescript to send boxcar notifications. It would be accessed via a Terminal command:\nosascript /path/to/script boxcar_username \"Title of Notification\" \"Body of Notification\" \"URL/to/54x54icon\"\nThis in turn maps to:\non run {BoxcarUSER, boxcartitle, boxcarmessage, BoxcarICONURL}\nThe BoxcarUSER variable is the only required one, the rest will use defaults.\nIf you have your own provider, you can open the script in script editor and change the property at the top of the script(I currently have it setuo with a provider I created, so feel free to change that)\nOther defaults could be changed within the  set { in the run{} handler.\nSome of the error catching is rough, as if you do not have an internet connection, cURL will fail with a non zero status (I think, no real expert there) so the script can't catch the error message.\nSome ideas I have thought about.\nSince you can map the icon that shows in boxcar, you could use different 57x57 icons to show the user different things that are happening.

I'm a desperate owner of a Sony HDR-XR520V and an avid Mac user.\nSony + Mac users know that the supplied footage management software—Picture Motion Browser (PMB)—is only for Windows.\nSony's advice for importing footage into the Mac is via the transfer feature of iMovie or Final Cut's \"log and transfer\". \nBoth applications cost money, but more importantly, the footage is being transcoded, so the initial AVCHD video will not be transfered/stored into your computer.\nMy last attempt was to try to use PMB inside a Parallels virtual machine. \nPMB may be bloated but it has a really nifty feature for footage syncing:\n\n\n*\n\n*At first sync, it transfers all data into your machine.\n\n*Then you may organize the imported footage into folders, however you like via the software or even Finder.\n\n*On every following sync, it transfers only the new videos.\n\n\nUnfortunately, those last versions are buggy and the program crashes every time I try to sync the camcorder. I've contacted their support but they said, \"the camcorder was only tested with original OSs and they do not support virtual machines.\" \nIn conclusion: is there a tool or process that mimics PMB's sync?\nI've looked into file management tools, and even rsync, but I cannot find a way to sync only the new videos, keeping in mind that the imported footage has been organized/moved into subdirectories.\nI know that instead of copying I could move the videos out of the camera, so no syncing would be required but I need to keep the footage in the camera because it's being used as a playback device as well.\n\nA: The new Final Cut Pro X natively supports AVCHD. The old Final Cut Pro Studio did not.\nAnd the new Final Cut Pro X is much less expensive at only $300. \nYou really should evaluate if it will meet your needs, and if your system has the specifications to run it.\n\nA: I realise this is quite an old question, but as per @WheatWilliams answer, the new iMovie also now natively supports AVCHD and resolves this problem (much cheaper!).\nAs best I can tell this started from iMovie 10.x and OS X 10.9 Mavericks (and up).\nThe H.264 stream from the ACCHD/MTS container is remuxed into a MOV container, the file size increases only minimally (maybe 2-5%?), and its very fast to import.\n\nA: I am just brainstorming here, but I think that at this point you are probably going to write your own software, and since you said you are familiar with rysnc, lets try something that sits on top of rsync. \nHow about a script that remembers each file you transfer and filters for you each time you transfer information?\nMy idea works out fairly simply. A program is clicked, this program is a python script which called rsync on the directories specified(The target camera volume and whatever end directory), and then\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync checks the filter list\n\n*rsync gets its commands from the python program and starts the transfer\nfiles are synchronized across the camera and folder\n\n*rsync's list of files to transfer are added to the filter list by the python program, or a log file is created/interpreted by python and then updates the filter file\n\n*files can now sit in the camera, and it will only transfer new files recorded that have new names, even if we move them out of their destination folder, rename them, or edit them.\n\n\nI am going to work on this tonight since I am not that familiar with rsyncs log file parsing, but it would be a fairly trivial solution.\nCheck out the filter file rules on the rsync manpage to check out what I am talking about.\n\nA: Try the free AVCHD to MOV Lite on the App Store.\n(Hat tip to How can I convert .MTS file (AVCHD) to .mp4 by ffmpeg without re-encoding H264 video stream?\n).\n", "Q: How to eject disk in osx before booting?

Previously before, I didn't touch apps like GeekTool because I was afraid that it would slow down my system performance severely. (MacBook Pro 15\" C2D 2.4ghz Late 2008) However, I have decided to use it as a clock on my wallpaper.\nHow much CPU % would GeekTool use? I only have the measly 2 hour battery for the MacBook Pro, so conserving as much CPU cycles as possible would be my aim.\n\nA: I have the same machine as you do and have GeekTool running.\nMy GeekTool atm uses 0.0% CPU and 19.9MB of RAM.\nI have several geeklet's running which poll different websites or system processes. (9 Geeklets)\n\nA: I used to have it as a clock until I realized that the console command used for getting the time took about 10% CPU. At first I had this run every second but quickly realized that wouldn't work. Then I changed it to every 1 min but then I had a clock that was off from time to time.\nMy tip is to go with the top bar clock. I do however not know if it requires less to load t\n\nA: I use geektool heavily for a lot of automated background tasks and that brings it to around the 70 megabytes area. Before you worry about any memory issues though, one of my best geeklets was specifically built to actively clean the ram when things get tight. \n\nA: Geektool is well suited for displaying static content with occasional refreshes - and you should stick to this usage model on a portable.\nA couple of 1 second refresh geeklets can noticeably reduce your battery time.\nFor example, I have rather complex Geektool setup (23 geeklets), but \"GeekTool Helper\" using 0.0 CPU in average. The secret is to set refresh value in seconds for geeklets as high as possible.\n\n\n\nA: GeekTool itself uses minimal CPU as shown by the other answers.\nHowever, GeekTool really just facilitates running other scripts. It's the frequency and impact of those scripts on your system you want to worry about. By tuning them in their runtime and CPU load you can have GeekTool present useful information with minimal system impact.\nI would focus less on GeekTool itself, and more on what you're running with it.\neg. on the clock example above, have it update the time once a minute, rather than every second.\nWeather geeklets can be run once every 15-30 mins as you feel is appropriate.\n", "Q: How to enable AirPrint on iPod Touch after iOS 4.2 Upgrade? I have an iPod Touch (Model MC086FD) and upgraded to iOS 4.2.1 - all works fine. But I do not find the AirPrint Software on the iPod. Can I install it? How do I make my iPod print (emails etc.) when connected by WLAN?\nI have a MacBook Pro with 10.6.6 Syncing with the iPod using iTunes 10.2.1. The printer is a Samsung CLX-3175FN connected by network.\nI have no Print button in the share menu. Also I tried AirPrint Activator to enable for my network printer. Nothing helped.\n\nA: My iPod touch is an 3. generation 8GB model (Model MC086FD).  As I found, Multitasking is needed to use AirPrint! But multitasking is not available for this model - even iOS 4.2 installed!\n\nA: AirPrint doesn't require an extra App. It works directly from the print-menu, if your printer has support for the feature.\nHere's a list of supported printer's and other notes for AirPrint:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4356\n", "Q: Move to Start of Line in Terminal.app Is there a quick key combo that will allow me after typing some stuff in the OSX terminal to move back to the beginning of that line?  I have tried different things, and was wondering if there is a way without setting up something that is custom.\n\nA: CTRL+a moves to the beginning of the line, CTRL+e to the end of the line.\n", "Q: How can I mirror my iPad display wirelessly? I am looking to display my iPad screen wirelessly to an external display to demo applications.  I found this video showing exactly what I want to do with an iPhone but no explanation as to what the hardware dongle used was.\nThe main thing is that there isn't a wire tethering the user to the external display.\n\nA: Edited to clarify: On the iPad 1, unfortunately there's no way to mirror the display without jailbreaking. Even the new Airplay iOS feature only allows the streaming of things specifically sent to the stream by an app, much like the hardware iPad video-out.\n\nA: Jailbreak, then install Veency.\n\nA: I'm curious to find out which of these devices are actually certified by Apple and has a Made for iPhone/iPad stamp.  I've yet to jailbreak my iPad so it's not convenient for me to use a product that will require me to download additional software or hack my iPad.  \nIt seems out of these solutions, only the Air Shuttle from CyWee is \"the first and only MFi-certified accessory that enables real-time audio and video transmission from an iPod, iPhone, or iPad.\"   Found this on their site at: http://cywee.com/products/wireless/air-shuttle/\n\nA: This is possible using iOS 5 and an Apple TV using AirPlay.\nThis only works with iPhone 4S and iPad 2 and all video and sound are mirrored wirelessly to any TV that is connected via HDMI downstream from the Apple TV. You do need a wireless network for the two devices to communicate. \n\nJust double-click the Home button, swipe all the way to the right, and\n  select AirPlay Mirroring.\n\nReference: http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/airplay.html\n\nA: What you're looking for is in the making, it just isn't here yet. \nSupposedly there's a gaming peripherals company out of the UK named Blaze that will be coming out sometime this April with a wireless TV-out setup that will mirror what's on an iPad screen. \n\nA: We made something that might be what you are trying to do.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnM8ciByJps\n\nA: You can download veency on your iPad2 and chicken vnc on your laptop, connected to the external display. Works great for flipping through pages or pics.\n\nA: An app came out just about a month ago called Reflector that mirrors the iPad display onto your Mac providing that all devices are on the same Wi-fi network (which is easy because with a Mac you can broadcast your wifi and create a network.\nYour iPad sees the iMac as an AirPlay compatible device which means that you can mirror everything. Best part of this is that you can use screen recording software on the Mac to capture your content.\n\nA: Hey we are a young Cupertino based start-up and we wanted you to take a look at our product Prijector. We are Airplay for all your devices and works very well for presenting wirelessly inside conference rooms.

I need this function in Finder. \n\n\nA: The idea in OS X is, that you open an Application and create the file while you are working. This simply because creating the file beforehand is kind of awkward:  \n\nCreate file > open file > edit\n\nOf course if you just need dummy files, then you can make those from Terminal.app, but I'd be careful with that if you are not used to it already.\nThe command is: touch filename\n\nA: proseek you can add to finder the extension \"shellhere\", that's great!\n", "Q: Should I virtualize Windows on Mac OS X using Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion? I have a MacBook Air and would like to install Windows Vista in a virtual machine, so I can use both Mac OS X and Windows at the same time.\nI have tried with VirtualBox, but it performed very bad and Mac OS X crashed sometimes.\nIt seems that Parallels Desktop 6 and VMware Fusion 3 does the job better. I will mostly do .NET development using WPF and some other software development.\nAs of 2011 what virtualization software, Parallels Desktop 6 or VMware Fusion 3 gives me the best Windows Vista user experience? \n\nA: I was in the exact situation as you 2 weeks ago. I have developer friends who have used Parallels in the past for their Windows development VMs, and they had since moved to VMware Fusion 3.\nI started off with a trial of Parallels Desktop 6; in a nutshell, I had issues virtualizing some of my physical machines, but overall it ran my VMs well. However, I did find the Coherence mode a little cumbersome in the UI. There were too many shortcuts created for my various VMs and the start menu used to launch Windows apps felt clunky.\nSo...I moved on to a trial of VMware Fusion 3. Despite all the performance reviews that say Parallels kills Fusion, running a VM in Fusion feels smooth and polished and starting, suspending and resuming a virtual machine are all very fast operations thanks to the SSD of the Macbook Air. The product overall is high quality and requires very little resources - I run 1 to 2 VMs for several hours at once during development. On my 4GB Macbook Air I only ever use half of that memory, including the operating system. (I have set my development VMs to use 1GB of RAM each).\nAnd those problems I had virtualizing my physical hardware with Parallels? Gone with VMware. All my hardware was virtualized on the first attempt, and VMware even flawlessly imported the Parallels VMs I had been working with.\nSo, I licensed VMware Fusion 3 and you can even get a  rebate on it like I did. That was the clincher for me.\nI'm happily using VMware Fusion 3 every day to run my Windows 7 development box with Visual Studio 2010, Oracle 10g Express, SQL Server 2008 Express, and other tools installed.\n\nA: The best advice. Trail both and then decide. I was a long time fan of VMWare, however recently moved to Parallels. Side by side, Parallels gave me a 5.1 experience index for Windows 7, and VMWare Fusion gave me a 4.9. Performance wise both are solid on my hardware, however I prefer the interface and coherence features of Parallels over Unity. This is however a personal preference. Full disclosure: I run a MacBook Pro i7, 8GB's of RAM and a 500GB 7200RPM HDD.\nBoth product does the job, and both work well. They are also in the same price bracket. You also can't compare features since both have the same functionality, just the method of implementation differs. The choice between the two is really up to you and how you use Windows virtualised. I game in Windows, and Parallels provided me a better experience. I also had issues running Expression Web, Silverlight and WPF in VMWare due to the graphics card, but this has apparently been resolved in the latest update.\nMy wife however prefers VMWare and finds it easier to use then Parallels. Moving machines between the two are fairly easy. Use one for the full trail, and then transfer your machine to the other and trial it. Do a comparison on which one works for you.\n\nA: I have now used VMware Fusion for over a year and been very pleased with it.\nI have Windows XP Home installed in a boot camp partition, so I can boot into it if needed, but - which is the real killer - vmware fusion supports booting the same Boot Camp partition into a virtual machine.\nThis means that for simple stuff, I can just boot Windows inside vmware and do what I need (Remote Desktop for Mac does not like ssh-forwarded ports, Remote Desktop for Windows does).  For complex stuff I can boot into Windows - this happens quite rarely.\n\nA: I use both Parallels and Fusion. For Windows 7 (sorry I stopped using Vista over a year ago) I use Fusion. It seems like it supports the hardware better. For example I need to plug in a USB smart card reader to access some resources at work. Fusion works just like I was running on real hardware. I never did get Parallels to recognize the reader correctly.\nIf you want to run Ubuntu in a VM, Parallels is a much nicer experience than Fusion (or VirtualBox for that matter). Parallels supports the full range of Compiz UI features. Fusion does not.\n\nA: I've used VMware for the exact purpose you describe, doing .NET development. (In my case, for Silverlight / WCF rather than WPF --- but that's moot)\nIn the end I opted for the bootcamp alternative.  At best, you'll get access to about half the memory of your machine, if you're lucky.  True VS may work on an OS with as little as 1GB of RAM but you'll find 4 GB a lot better.\n", "Q: How to get MacVim to autoload ~/.vim/syntax This might be something quirky about MacVim, so I'll ask here.\nI put a syntax file in ~/.vim/syntax, but it doesn't load. I have syntax on in my .vimrc.\nWhen I open the editor, :scriptnames doesn't include the syntax file. \nIs there anything else I need to do to make sure it loads?\n\nA: In addition to relying on the detected filetype, which may be incorrect, there are at least two alternative ways to force loading of a particular syntax file. \n\n\n*\n\n*Manually run the command :set ft=lesscss\n\n*Add the previous setting to a modeline near the beginning or ending of the file.  See :help modeline.\n\nA: Figured it out. It seems like files in $VIMRUNTIME/syntax are loaded based on the detected filetype when the actual file is loaded.\nhttp://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html#syntax-loading\nSo I just renamed the file to the detected filetype, lesscss, and it loaded fine.\n", "Q: Missing Faces When Creating iPhoto '11 Smart Album I am having trouble creating a Smart Album based on Faces in iPhoto '11. Whenever I set up a Smart Album condition using \"Face IS\" the third drop-down menu is populated with a list of my Faces. This list contains many of the names of faces I have set up, but there are names missing from the list that always appear if I go directly to the Faces corkboard.\nAny idea why some of my Faces are missing from this drop-down list?\nThe other weird thing is that there are several duplicate listings in the drop-down list that I have merged within the Faces corkboard and are now listed as a single person.

Is there a Quick Look plug-in that works with ZIP files, and that lists all the files contained in the archive? It is also fine if it lists at least some of the files.\n\nA: There's also the open source qlZipInfo that works for .zip, .jar, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.Z, .xar, .pkg, .deb, .rpm, .7z, .xz, .cab, .gz, .lha, .hqx, .sit, .iso, .cdr, and .toast files.\nInstall instructions are given on its GitHub page; it supports macOS from 10.6 to the current release (12.6). It provides a simple list of files and directories (if present) with totals.\n\nA: Well, Better Zip  does a fair job.\n\nA: WinZip installs one but BetterZip's is better, although includes an advert for BetterZip each time you use it. \n\nA: Another alternative is The Archive Browser.  It is a commercial tool as well but will show the contents of various file types.\nFrom the site:\n\nThe Archive Browser lets you easily peek into the archive, find the files you need, preview and extract them without unarchiving everything.

It's surprisingly robust, and it's made by Apple.\n\nA: You can also use Preview, go File -> Import from iPhone.\n\nA: You can also try apps like DropPhox which will sync your pictures to Dropbox as soon as you click them. Very handy!\n", "Q: Why does Reply All also reply to me? I've setup an Exchange account to point to my work address and it works pretty well.  The only annoyance is that if I receive an email that has several recipients, pressing Reply All, also includes me on the To or CC list.  \nWhen I do the same operation in Outlook, I am not included in the To/CC list.  \nHow can I get the iPhone to stop including me on the Reply All?\n\nA: A coworker pointed out an inconsistency with my email account and that led to the resolution of the issue.  \nOn our corporate server, there is a main email address and you could also make any number of aliases.  So for instance, my email address is frankrizzo@mycompany.com.  But if you send me an email to frank.rizzo@mycompany.com or frank+rizzo@mycompany.com, it will reach me as well.\nIn the iPhone, I entered my account as frank.rizzo@mycompany.com (with the dot).  However, people kept sending emails to my main account - frankrizzo@mycompany.com - without the dot.  The iPhone saw the one without the dot as not mine and thus was including it on the Reply All screen.\n\nA: I think this only happened on older versions of the software.  I just tested it on iOS 4.2.1 and it didn't happen to me but I remember it used to happen.  I don't know which version fixed it but you could update to the latest version of iOS and that should fix it.\n\nA: I had the same issue and discovered the email address in my iPhone Mail app account was different from my actual email address. \nTherefore Mail.app did not recognize my address in emails sent to me as my own. I changed the email in account on Mail app and it works now\n", "Q: How do I undo overwriting my /usr/local/bin folder? I think i overwrote my /usr/local/bin folder - any way to undo this?\nI was installing MacVim and did the following command:\nsudo mv mvim /usr/local/bin\n\nNow instead of copying mvim into my /usr/local/bin folder, i think it replaced that folder with a file called 'bin'...\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Well, it's not a complete disaster.  You could have done it to /usr/bin.  The obvious first answer is restore it from a backup.  If you don't have a backup then you can take some comfort in the fact that the /usr/local/bin directory isn't in the default search path for command-line executables without extra steps being taken so the damage you've caused is likely to be limited.  Really, without a backup all you can do is reinstall apps which had files there.  Without knowing what they were, you'll probably need to wait for apps to misbehave or crash and then you can try a reinstall to see if that fixes them.  Hopefully you have Time Machine set up in which case it's a simple matter of following the procedure below:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal to run the following commands\n\n*defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\n*killall Finder - this restarts Finder so it will show the hidden system files\n\n*Open a Finder window for your Hard Drive\n\n*Open usr, then local, then bin\n\n*Launch Time Machine\n\n*With the bin folder selected, scroll back in time in the time machine interface to your last successful backup of the /usr/local/bin folder and click restore in the bottom-right corner\n\n*In a few moments, your folder will be restored.\n\n\nAlso, in future be very careful what you do with sudo and especially sudo mv.  You can use sudo mv -i mvim /usr/local/bin/mvim and the -i will warn you instead of just overwriting whatever it finds at /usr/local/bin/mvim.  \nAfter you're done, you can hide the hidden files again by running the following commands in Terminal  \n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE  \n\n*killall Finder\n\nA: You have Time Machine running, right? Just go in your Time Machine back a few hours and restore the file from there.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Kernel Panic on Boot - even without a hard drive installed My (Discrete, not Unibody) MBP (2007-ish) just started to kernel panic on boot.  \nPulled the HDD, which boots via USB on my Mini - hopefully ruling out a HDD or data/OS issue.\nI've disconnected the Airport card as well as removed the memory SO-DIMMs and booted with one at a time.  Still kernel panics.\nTried the Apple Hardware Installer/Diagnostic DVD and it froze near the end (logic board testing...)\nWasn't able to get it to boot to try Tech Tool Pro diagnostics.\nAll signs are pointing to a logic board failure - am I missing anything?\n\nA: I don't think you're missing anything. This all makes sense if you assume a dead logic board.\nWhat makes you think that isn't the problem? Seems like plenty of evidence for it to me.\n\nA: Turns out it's a known nVidia GPU related issue, which is covered under a recall.\nIt appears to be related to this service notice: http://support.apple.com/kb/ts2377 , although it doesn't talk about Kernel Panics as a symptom.  \nThe Apple 'Genius' ran a video diagnostic and confirmed that the GPU had failed - he likely knew it was the issue as the whole diagnostic took about 5 minutes.\nThankful as it means a new logic board for free!

The phone displays the green battery meter indicating it's charging, System Profiler detects an \"iPhone\" connected to the USB bus, and I can even open iPhoto and pull some pictures off of it. \nIt doesn't appear under \"Devices\" in iTunes at all, nor does it appear in the Organizer window in Xcode.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a different sync cable.\n\n*Using a different USB port.\n\n*Restarting the phone.\n\n*Restarting the computer.\n\n*Connecting the phone to a different computer.\n\n\n(I'm on OS X 10.6.6 and iTunes 10.1.2)\n\nA: I had this problem on Lion, which doesn't allow the deletion of iTunes through the UI. Therefore, it was necessary to force the uninstall of iTunes from Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /Applications\n\n*sudo rm -r iTunes.app\nI then pulled down the latest iTunes installer from Apple.\nAll my iTunes settings were maintained and my iPhone and iPad showed up again under devices. \n\nA: This worked for me on my Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n\n*Open Image Capture (located in Applications).\n\n*Select your device from the Devices list.\n\n*Select \"iTunes\" in the pop-up menu in the Device Settings.\n\n\nSometimes iPhoto recognizes the iPhone and overrides iTunes. Not sure why Image Capture is the middle-man, but something to do with recognizing the iPhone as a camera rather than a phone, I'm guessing. This is a simple fix!\n\nA: The other answers to this question as of writing this answer are now somewhat outdated – you can't manually uninstall iTunes without disabling SIP on El Capitan and newer macOS versions, and I would not recommend disabling SIP to delete iTunes. Continue reading this answer for an updated method.\nReinstall iTunes\nIf your iPhone isn't showing up on iTunes on macOS, you may reinstall iTunes by downloading the installer from here. Note that this will work on newer macOS versions such as El Capitan, Sierra, and High Sierra. You do not need to disable System Integrity Protection to do this. \nAs a matter of fact, this is what solved my issue on a Mac with High Sierra. My iPhone wasn't showing up in iTunes or Xcode, but reinstalling iTunes allowed it to show up again.\nIf, however, you issue isn't solved by reinstalling iTunes, there are a myriad of things you could try. In order to diagnose my own issue I made  a list of things you could try, which you can find below. Some of these points may solve your issue. Some allow you to diagnose what might be causing the issue; these will thereby help you to isolate the cause and hopefully be able to fix it.\n\nFor macOS and Windows\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a look at Apple's own guide for troubleshooting the issue (advice for both macOS and Windows is available here).\n\n*Try a different, certified lightning cable. A lightning cable might stop working (even if your device charges). Using an uncertified (non-MFi) cable can cause unexpected behavior such as preventing your iPhone from showing up in iTunes.\n\n*Try connecting your iPhone to a different computer. Connect it to another Mac; does it show up there? What about on a Windows PC? If it shows up on another computer, there might be something wrong with your own computer. Try looking at Apple's guide above if this is the case.\n\n*Try connecting another iPhone to your computer. Does it show up? If it does, there might be something wrong with your main iPhone. If it doesn't, it might mean that iTunes on your computer doesn't want to display any devices. You can confirm this by checking the previous point.\n\n*Try restarting iTunes. If that doesn't work, try restarting your iPhone or your computer. Perhaps it'll show up after a reboot.\n\n*Try different USB ports on your computer, in the case that one is faulty.\n\n*If you have any third-party iPhone managers installed such as AnyTrans, iMazing, or iFunBox, try seeing whether the device shows up there. You may also try other apps that work by detecting your iPhone and see if they can still detect it (such as coconutBattery).\n\n*Unlock your device and see if any computer trust popup shows up.\n\n*Is the iPhone or computer running on beta software? If so, that might be causing unexpected problems. Either upgrade to the latest beta or downgrade to the latest stable release (usually the latter will work).\n\n*Put your iPhone in DFU mode (if you have an iPhone 7, you need to see the special instructions on the bottom of that page). After putting it successfully in DFU mode, does it show up in iTunes? If it does, then your cable most likely works. If it doesn't, try plugging it in (while it's in DFU mode) into another computer, with another cable, or into a different USB port.\n\n*Reset your iPhone privacy settings, which resets computer trust settings. Warning: this is not guaranteed to solve the issue, and will cause all your privacy settings to be deleted. I recommend your open your essential apps (camera, GPS apps, communication apps, etc.) and allow permissions so that you don't have to deal with them later (I once reset my settings and the camera location popup didn't show up, which meant a lot of pictures weren't geotagged).\n\n\nFor macOS only\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System information (located at /Applications/Utilities/System Information.app) and click the USB tab on the left. Does  \"iPhone\" anywhere in the USB tree view? If it does, your Mac recognizes that an iPhone is connected to it, even if iTunes doesn't.\n\n*Open the Image Capture (located at /Applications/Image Capture.app). Does it recognize your device?\n\n*If you have Xcode installed, try seeing if your device is recognized by it.\n\n\nFor Windows only\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your iPhone show up as a device in Device manager?\n\n*The best advice I would suggest on Windows would be to follow Apple's guide on troubleshooting this issue on Windows which I linked above.\n\n*If nothing seems to work, try reinstalling iTunes.\n\n\nEven if these suggestions don't help you fix your problem, they'll give you an idea about what's causing the problem. Is it your device, your cable, or your computer? What about these may the problem be? Hopefully with the new information you'll be able to come to a better informed decision as to how to go about fixing the problem.\n\nA: Run Activity Monitor (Applications/Utilities);  do you see the iTunes Helper service running?  Make sure you set the view to \"All processes\", not \"My Processes\".  If it's not running, that's your problem.  Re-install iTunes and away you go.\n\nA: this worked for me. \nI managed to fix this problem by opening the device manager and plugging in the device. the computer recognized the hardware but said there was a problem with the driver then I went to > Universal serial bus controllers > apple mobile device USB driver > update drivers.  It worked!!!\n", "Q: How to resolve repeated emails asking for verification of my Apple ID? I have received my email to verify my Apple ID, but when I click on the verify now it will not open a verification window in Internet Explorer 8.  I receive the error \"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage\".  \nI do not know what else to do.  I can log into my Apple ID and resend the verification email over and over, but I continue to receive this message.\n\nA: I have seen this problem where internet explorer doesn't open certain web pages. It may be an issue with internet explorer not having SSL enabled. In internet explorer go to the Tools menu and click internet options (you can also get to internet options from control panel). Click on the advanced tab and scroll to security, make sure there are check marks where it says SSL 2.0 and 3.0 and then click apply.\nIf that doesn't work just install another browser like safari or firefox.\n\nA: There isn't anything special about visiting https://appleid.apple.com than any other web site that uses SSL.\nCheck the date on your computer, turn off extensions, allow cookies - you generally get a message that your account has been disabled if that's the issue - so unless your browser suppresses that message, it's likely a browser configuration issue.\nGoing to another computer to make sure your account hasn't been locked due to too many attempts might be prudent if you're confident your browser isn't somehow blocking the web site from doing it's job.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/appleid/ really does walk you through the things to check.\n", "Q: Transfer file between iPhones using Bluetooh Can I transfer data between two iPhones via Bluetooth?\n\nA: Yes. \nThere's an AppStore app called Bluetooth Fileshare ($0.99), but it has very low reviews. Also, check out Bluetooth Photo Share (free) if you're only interested in transferring photos.\nIf you have a jailbroken iPhone, you can use iBlueNova ($5.99), but there might be better/free ways to do file transfer if you're already jailbroken.\n\nA: If you jsut want to transfer images/contact details etc Bump is a good app, it also works cross platform too.\n\nA: Why not use AirDrop? You can transfer a lot of information pretty fast and don't require any new software to be loaded?\n", "Q: How do I get the latest drivers for boot camp and windows 7 I have read the setup guide, but what is either not clear or I just missed, is how the updated drivers that I download via the apple update get to my windows partition.  All I read is that I have to have the original Mac OSX DVD and that I get the drivers from that.\nI know that my Mac is up to date and I have both my windows 7 ultimate and OSX 10.6 DVD in hand and USB keyboard and mouse.  The partitioning is proceeding as advertised.  But I am skeptical of what should happen next. \nHow do get the latest apple drivers.\n(mac mini 4gb from 02/2010)\n\nA: Ralph - drivers are on the OS X DVD.  So once the OS is installed, boot into it and if you need drivers, you can point your OS to the OS X DVD.  Win 7 however, does a lot better with drivers than XP - I would think it will auto-update as needed.  You will have fewer problems than it seems you're currently expecting;  don't sweat it.  :-)\n\nA: Snow Leopard was released to retail before Windows 7. It didn't come with Windows 7 support on the DVD.\nApple don't give very detailed descriptions of their updates, but I'm guessing they are recommending 3.1 before attempting to install Windows 7 because of something other than drivers. Perhaps something to do with the partitioning or the boot loader side of things. One difference I'm aware of is that Windows 7 creates two partitions by default where previous versions only created one.\nTo answer the original question, once you are in Windows you insert the Snow Leopard DVD and Windows will launch the setup.exe from the DVD. This will install the drivers and Apple Software Update, and create a Scheduled Task in Windows to launch Apple Software Update once a week to check for updated drivers.\n", "Q: Why are USB devices drawing power, but not being recognized by the OS? I have an issue with the USB ports on my Macbook Pro. When I plug a device in, the device draws the power, but nothing else happen. This is what I know about this problem:\n1- USB Prober can see the connected devices and identify them\n2- VMFusion it's able to connect the device into the guest OS but nothing happens\n3- If I reboot in windows all works good (no HW fault)\n4- I tried to reboot in safe mode, login, reboot\n5- I tried to reset SMC, nothing.  \nLater on I realized that apparently this issue it's related only to the composite devices, a simple USB disk work. An iPhone, iPod or Broadband Modem will not work.\nAny idea ?\n\nA: Well - if the port works, and you can plug in multiple other devices into the port it sure looks like the problem lies in the composite device and not the mac.\nThe only way to know if that type of device is broken or is just not compatible (and the mac is shutting it off immediately on detection to protect itself) is to take that device to another mac of the similar hardware and test.\nExperience would say just that device is broken - but you'll have to test to know for sure.\n", "Q: How do I connect my Mac to Wi-Fi automatically? I have a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X, but it doesn't connect to Wi-Fi automatically. If I turn Wi-Fi on, I then have to manually select the network. Is there some way to change this behaviour?\n\nA: I have spent about 6 years with 3 Macs with this kind of problem unresolved. I did not have it \"in the very beginning\", with some ancient versions of Mac OS X etc. Finally decided to look closer and it looks like it could be some \"bug\" that is related to the extra network settings that programs like VMWare Fusion, VirtualBox etc. leave on the Mac.\nEssentially, OS X thinks the Mac is connected to these networks and does not need the Wi-Fi. Luckily, the automation service cron from the very old days seems to be still working in current Macs (I've read some complaints it doesn't), and I got it to execute a script to connect to Wi-Fi if disconnected. It is a two step process. First, run sudo crontab -e in Terminal, and paste in that editor:\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\nMAILTO=user\nHOME=/\n*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/macWiFireconnect.sh\n\nThe most important line is the last, which executes macWiFireconnect.sh every one minute, you can change the 1 if you want. Then, the executable script macWiFireconnect.sh looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nSERVER=8.8.8.8\nping -c2 ${SERVER} > /dev/null\nif [ $? != 0 ]\nthen\n    networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 WifiName WifiPassword\nfi\n\n\nAlso enable the script to be executable.\nsudo chmod 700 /usr/local/bin/macWiFireconnect.sh\n\nSo, the script runs the networksetup command if it cannot connect to Google.\n\nA: Mac OS X should automatically join any known networks, as reported in the network applet.\nAfter you select the Airport service in the list of the network connection, you can click on the Advanced button, which will show a dialog that allows you to select your preferred networks, and to sort them.\n \n\nThe Mac will not automatically connect if it doesn't find any of the preferred networks, or if the preferred network requires a \"password\" that is unknown to the Mac.\n\nA: In the Wi-Fi preferences, go into the advanced tab and drag your home Wi-Fi network to the top of the list. Remember to lock your settings once you are done.\nThis should auto-connect once you switch on your AirPort.\n\nA: This helped for me... On the list of networks, my home network was actually listed twice. One instance was on the top, and the second way down the list. I moved the second instance to the top (both instances now at the top) and it now connects to the home network automatically.\nI couldn't figure out how to delete the old instance, but it seems fine so far for both of them to exist.\nHope this helps\n\nA: macOS Ventura 2023\nSystem Settings > Wi-Fi > Choose ... of the network you wanna connect automatically > Choose Auto-Join\n\n", "Q: How can I add a private key to my keychain? I am trying to add myRepositoryKey to my Mac keychain utility so . I exported this item in OpenRSA format from Putty. When I try to use Import Items, the file is unselectable. What do I need to do to import into my keychain? Does the file need a specific extension?\n\nA: I've tried to import a .p12 using Keychain's GUI just to be silently ignored under Lion. So just for completeness, I'd like to this post in Stephan's Blog\nhttp://www.arlt.eu/blog/2009/12/01/importing-iphone-keys-p12-and-pem-into-snow-leopards-keychain/\nIn short, this should do the trick every time:\nsecurity import priv_key.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\nsecurity import pub_key.pem -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n\n\nA: You have to create a .p12 file. In order to do that you need your private key and a certificate for that key. Then run the following on your console:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -out MyPKCS12.p12 -name \"Your Name\"\n\nwhere private.key is your existing private RSA key, certificate.crt is your existing certificate and MyPKCS12.p12 is the name of the file to create. This file can then be imported into your keychain.\nIf you need your key for SSH access (SFTP, SCP or similar), it doesn't have to be in your keychain. Simply copy your private key to ~/.ssh/ and edit/create the ~/.ssh/config file. There you would put something along these lines:\n# replace the host, location of the private key and the remoteUserName\n# with valid values.\nHost remote.domain.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private.key\n    User remoteUserName\n\n\nA: Well I don't get that \"need a certificate for the key\" either...\nI just do ssh-add -K /path/to/private/key.\nHowever, make sure you're using Mac's built-in ssh-add and not Macports' one (if you ever needed to upgrade OpenSSH).\nSo, just do /usr/bin/ssh-add -K /path/to/private/key.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Considering all in PEM format, private key file is server-key.key and certificate file is server-cert.pem. \n# create .p12 formatted file with key and certificate using openssl. \nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in server-cert.pem -inkey server-key.key -passout pass:password -out certificate.p12 -name \"SCProxy\"\n\n# should use -T appPath. -A means this key is accessible for all apps. \nsudo security import certificate.p12 -A -P password -k \"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\"\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k \"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\" server-cert.pem\n\n", "Q: Turn off Anti-Aliasing on Mac This is a followup to the Stack Overflow question, Why does there appear to be a different number of unique colors available on the Mac as compared to Windows?\nHow can I turn off anti-aliasing on a Mac, either through manual settings or, more preferably, while doing a screen capture (i.e., when I capture the screen, I need the raw data without anti-aliasing algorithms applied)? \n\nA: You can manually turn off font-antialiasing with this terminal command:\ndefaults write CoreGraphics CGFontDisableAntialiasing YES\n\nto turn antialiasing back on again use this:\ndefaults write CoreGraphics CGFontDisableAntialiasing NO\n\n\nA: Does the Command + Option + \\ helps?\nThis option keys disable the Anti Aliasing when doing the Zoom (using Ctrl + Scroll)\n", "Q: How to open FrameMaker files on a Mac with OS X? I have some old FrameMaker documents on my Mac (Intel Core Duo, OS X 1.6.6). Is there any way to open this files (readonly would be ok)? I cannot use the FrameMaker 10 trial from Adobe, because it is windows only. There has been a reader/viewer app in the past but I cannot find it anywhere.\nThere are two file formats:\n\n\n*\n\n**.mif is Maker Interchange Format (an XML dialect)\n\n**.fm is FrameMaker binary\n\n\nA: Adobe provides an online pdf creator which they state handles FrameMaker files.\nHowever, it costs $10 a month to use it, but it might be worth a shot.

On my 2010 MBP, I want to encode several hours of video, which will end up with the CPU used at 100% for a long time and the MBP heating quite a lot.\nIs this considered as normal use (I would say yes, isn't it what computers are made for! :)) ? Could it end up with a too high internal temperature and could it damage some components? (The aluminium case will be hot but the hand is not a good thermometer).\nIn case this could be a problem, is there a way to cap the maximum cpu% a process can use. I don't really care about the time it will take, I just don't want to kill my MBP...!\n\nA: 100% CPU utilization will not directly be harmful to your laptop.  Heat, however, can be.  Your MacBook Pro does have several internal temperature sensors that will turn on the internal fan and finally halt the machine should it get too hot.  You can see the temperature each sensor is reading by using this free program:\nhttp://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html\nYou should still use some type of cooling stand if possible.  My 2007 MacBook Pro suffered a broken display from what I believe to be a heat related issue.  After heavy use and high CPU utilization the bottom of the display would get very hot.  Then, the screen would start to flicker slightly (but only when the laptop was running hot).  Eventually, the screen had to be replaced.  Using a laptop stand with multiple fans kept my machine running cool enough to prevent the issue from happening again.\nAlso, you do have some control over how much CPU a process gets.  For that you can use BeNicer, another free piece of software:\nhttp://frozenheads.com/page/benicer\n\nA: i would assume that 100% usage doesn't really mean that it's at it's full capacity and about to explode, but more that the CPU is does as much as it has been limited to do at one time, so it's kinda already capped.\nThe concept of overclocking is to push a computer to it's absolute limits and squeezing out as much \"power\" as possible, which has more chance of causing issues with overheating that could potentially cause damage.\nAs you said the CPU should be designed to be used upto 100% and shouldn't cause itself serious harm and as SomeOtherGuy said, it should protect itself from damage should it start to overheat.\nIncidentally, my MBP gets ridiculously hot from being sat on charge all day, so I have resorted to having an external keyboard to stop my palms sweating while typing. The computer itself hasn't been affected by this obviously - any slow down is more likely to do with how much guff is on it and that I don't really maintain my computer. It'll be getting a reformat soon to clean it up and back to full speed.\n\nA: Defocusing from the percentage … \nHeat\nSomeone (not me) reported 90° C using Lion (not with the released version — some time before the golden master of 10.7 was seeded). \nHere without worry I sometimes see peaks above boiling point. I trust the fans to cool things appropriately. \n\nA: Before components are damaged, the MacBook Pro will shut down, they have heat sensors and shut down if they get too hot. You may loose some data, but the MBP should be fine.\nHowever, I would put it on a laptop stand with good ventilation, just to be sure.\n\nA: On the multi core CPUs that are used in recent MBPs the processor load can go up to \"cores x 100 %\".\nSo for a dual core processor 200 % would be maximum.\n", "Q: Detaching from Active Directory and keeping mobile accounts I have a MacBook Pro which is attached to an AD domain.  The user has a domain account which is Administrator, Managed and Mobile - the home directory is on the local machine.\nThe company is closing and the user is keeping the Mac, so I want to change the account to be a local account, or recreate a local account with the same name and change ownership.\nWhen I remove the machine from the domain, I don't seem to be able to delete the user from the Accounts panel.\nI presume I can remove them from the machine if I rejoin the domain, and then change ownership of the home directory with find; is there a cleaner way?\n\nA: There's a simpler way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as a different, admin, user.\n\n*Delete the account in question; select the option \"Don't change the home folder\"\n\n*Go to /Users and rename the home folder from username+deleted to the original, desired, short name.\n\n*Add a new local user with the same short name; you will be asked would you like to use the existing folder. Agree to this and it 'adopts' the previous folder, and fixes permissions. Nothing else to do.\n\n\nJust tested this successfully on OS X 10.9\n\nA: Create a new user account and move/copy the files from the old account to the new one.  After they have been moved reset the ownership using chmod -R  .  I'm guessing there is a way using NetInfo that this account could be change but I wouldn't recommend it.  \nIdeally, you might just want to backup your data and reinstall all the software because you may not have ownership of some of the software (the company may have sold it off when they closed).  :-)\n", "Q: Has anyone ever tried to use an iPhone as web server? Yeah, it makes no sense to use an iPhone as web server, although the hardware could be used in some interesting ways if this would be possible. You could, for example, set up the iPhone to send a phonecall or SMS with pre-recorded message to someone who, for example, send his phonenumber through it's web interface to be included in it's address book.\nAgain, it's not very useful, but it would be cool to be able to communicate with an iPhone-based web server. Who knows? Maybe someone does come up with a practical purpose for this!\n\nA: Yes, this has been done. Here is some articles about one of the ways it has been done:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone Becomes a Web Server\n\n*iPhone ‘Personal Data Center’ Debuts in US\nAnd this is the product:\nhttp://serversman.com/index_en.jsp\n\nA: Although it is fixed function and not exactly what your looking for (but does show the concept in action), the HanDBase iPhone application includes a web server -- that's how you upload and download databases, by pointing your host web browser at the iPhone.\n\nA: Yes, I set it up on my iPhone to serve up voicemails.  It was a pain getting voicemail through WinSCP, so I made a small web interface that would let me download them by going to myiphone.local.  I can also get my photos from there as well.  \nI used lighttpd as the webserver (you can get that from cydia), sqllite, and php to serve the pages.\nThe bad thing is that it only works when the iphone is on.  Once its off, you can't access it anymore.\nThere is also a dynamicDNS app called iDNS you can use to set a domain name for your iPhone.\n\nA: Developers can easily add web server functionality to their iOS apps using the CocoaHTTPServer library. Apps that implement it often use it to allow users to transfer data between their phones and any computer with a browser that's on the same WiFi network.\n", "Q: How to jump to a location using mouse on iTerm/terminal? I work on a terminal most of the time. \nIs there an application / plugin over iTerm or any other terminal like application using which I can control the cursor location of my terminal using a mouse ?\n\nA: At least in Terminal.app you can hold down option while clicking to jump within your current line (that actually means just the line, so if your current prompt is so long that it wraps to a second line of input you'll have to option-click to the beginning of the \"second\" line and then hop with the arrow keys to the \"first\" line where you can  option-click again.)\n\nA: The keyboard is often your best friend. In a default configuration, your shell controls much of how you navigate around the command prompt.\nOption + b goes back a word (the cursor will end up at the first letter of the previous word).\nOption + f goes forward a word (the cursor will be at the non-letter character AFTER the next word).\nShift + Fn + Left Arrow (←) will put the cursor at the very start of the line. (Ctrl + a will also do this.)\nShift + Fn + Right Arrow (→) will put the cursor at the very end of the line. (Ctrl + e will also do this.)\nSo if I have a long command, for example:\n$ rsync -avz --progress ~/Sites/Development/My/Project web@server:/deployment/output/area\nAnd I start hitting Option + b, the cursor will stop on the a in area, the o in output, the d in deployment, etc.\nIf I go to the start of the line, and start hitting Option + f, the cursor will stop at the space after rsync, the space after avz, the space after progress, the / after Sites, etc.\n\nA: If you are specifically interested in movement in Vim, then you can add set mouse=a to your ~/.vimrc file.\nIt does work in iTerm for movement. It also allows you to mark sections as if you had entered visual mode, so that you can yank or delete it or comment out code depending on your plugins.\nVery conveniently it also lets you quickly scroll through a large document using a two-finger slide or mouse wheel.\nThe only drawback is that it makes it difficult to select text that you want to copy for use in other applications—though all you have to do is press option while you select.\nAlso: note that, if you add something like vimpager (also on macports), then you can also scroll through man pages once you add:\nexport PAGER=/opt/local/bin/vimpager #or wherever vimpager is installed\nalias less=$PAGER\n\nto your .profile or .bashrc.\n\nA: It's quite a time since this question came up and I did already mention the below on this platform in Option-click in iTerm and the issue tracker of iTerm2 but maybe it's of help for one or the other:\nHi, just wanted to let you know that I implemented that feature in iTerm2. It's not yet in the official iTerm2 repo but if you'd like to give it a go, you can find it at github.\nSince it's tested only by me consider it not-stable. I did test it with bash, vi and emacs and did my best to resemble Terminal.app behavior.\nThere's a precompiled binary on github too iTerm_v1.0.0.20120312.git-b919985b.zip (for i386/x86_64/ppc).\nOf course any feedback is welcome.\n\nA: In iTerm2 you hold down alt (left or right) and click to move the cursor to any position on any line.\n\nA: When option click doesn't work, it seems that it's possible to do this with the fn key. Over an ssh session in iTerm2, I was able to hold fn and click where I wanted the cursor to move in vim normal mode, for example.\n", "Q: Why can my Mac charge my iPad but other computers can't?

While it's very subjective, I'll put the one that I think is better on top\nHiding windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*M: Individual windows can be minimized.\n\n*H: All windows must be hidden.\n\n\nAccessing windows via Expose:\n\n\n*\n\n*M: Windows can be accessed via Expose on the bottom row.\n\n*H: There's no way to access the app's windows via Expose.\n\n\nAccessing windows via Application Switcher:\n\n\n*\n\n*H: Windows are restored exactly as they were when using the Application Switcher.\n\n*M: Windows cannot be restored via the Application Switcher.\n\n\nAccessing windows via Dock:\n\n\n*\n\n*H: Clicking the dock icon (or any window in the icon's menu) restores all of the app's windows, except those that were minimized.\n\n*M: Clicking the app's icon in the dock only opens up the last window minimized, and only if there aren't any visible windows.\n\n\nApplication Switcher icon location:\n\n\n*\n\n*H: The app's icon moves to the right-hand side in the Application Switcher, moving it out of the way.\n\n*M: The app's icon stays in the same place, even if all windows are minimized.\n\n\nIndication of hidden windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*M: Minimized windows are displayed in the dock, and diamonds are displayed next to each window's title. (There's a setting is System Preferences to hide the windows from appearing in the dock.)\n\n*H: No indication that the app/windows are hidden whatsoever, not even diamonds appear next to the window's titles. (This can be changed by running the following in Terminal: defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES; killall Dock. You can undo this by typing: defaults delete com.apple.Dock showhidden; killall Dock.)\n\n\nSwitching focus to a new application:\n\n\n*\n\n*H: After hiding an app, the focus is sent to another app.\n\n*M: Even if you minimize an app's last window, it will still remain focused.\n\n\nOther Differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*H: You cannot hide all open applications. At least one has to remain visible.\n\n*H: As @Ian pointed out, some apps will use up less resources when they are hidden.\n\n\nA: One more thing to consider: when hidden, apps can be brought back with CMD-TAB combination. But when you do it, you will bring up all open windows of that application.\nWhen minimized, this is not possible. In a clean OS X there is no way to do it without using the mouse, at least in my knowledge. Using a mouse is considered a slow-down by a number of users.\nIn general, OS X is application-centric (and windows are of second importance), as opposed to Windows, which is window-centered. I prefer window-centered approach (since I need a window to interact with the machine, therefore windows are what I care about), but this requires 3rd party tools, such as Witch.\n", "Q: Suspending VMWare Fusion instance that uses Boot Camp partition? I run my Windows 7 that's installed on Boot Camp via VMWare Fusion. I like keeping it open so that I don't need to wait 3 minutes until it starts up and so that I don't need to login every time I close the application. The only problem is that it uses up lot's of resources (e.g. 1GB ram) even when I'm not actively using it.\nWhat I would really want is to have it running in the background, but not consuming any resources. Sort of like hibernating the virtual machine, such that when I start it up, ideally the same exact state is restored very quickly and doesn't require a login.\nI thought that I might be able to do this with VMWare Fusion's Suspend command, but it's disabled on my version. Is suspend really the feature I'm looking for? If so, how can I enable this feature?\nUpdate: According to the help, it seems that this is the feature I'm looking for, however it's not supported with boot camp partitions. Is there any similar feature, hack, or do you have any other suggestions which can produce similar results as VMWare's suspend feature for Boot Camp partitions?\n\nA: I know that Parallels 6 can 'pause' the boot camp partition. It suspends the virtual machine and frees up system resources without actually suspending the machine i.e. hibernation, however I don't know of any hack/workaround for VMWare Fusion.\nAlso Parallels can suspend the machine very quickly (around 5 seconds) so you can quit the app freeing up resources. I use it quite a lot as my computing class requires Windows.\n\nPausing a Virtual Machine\n  Pausing a virtual machine releases the resources, such as RAM and CPU, currently used by this virtual machine. The released resources can then be used by the host computer and its applications or by other virtual machines running on the host computer.\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Does powertop work with Mac OS X Snow Leopard or are there other power profiling utilities? I recently came across a blog post highlighting powertop for Linux (see: http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/).  Based on the FAQ, powertop relies on the fact that the Linux kernel is now tickless.  Given a specific Linux kernel requirement, I am doubtful that it will work with the Darwin kernel.  Freshmeat also mentions powertop, but they have a tag suggesting that a POSIX compliant OS can use powertop.  Since FreeBSD is POSIX compliant, I was wondering if anyone had tried powertop on Snow Leopard ?\nIf not, does anyone know of similar, power profiling tools for Snow Leopard ?  Specifically, power profiling tools that highlight processes consuming power.\nThanks,\nScott\n\nA: Using dtrace and counting which processes wake and the reason and time, you might be able to get some of the information provided by powertop\n", "Q: What is the difference between console.log and system.log? I am checking system logs via the Console utility.  I am wondering what the difference is between the console.log and system.log file?\n\nA: Console.log is usually written to by calls to Apple's NSLog() function call. (I can't find any other way to write to it so might be the only way) This writes to the log of the user that the app is running as\nsystem.log is written to by the unix call syslog. syslog can be configured to write to different files and machines. system.log is a central file written to by all users.\nThus only code written specifically for OSX will write to console.log and only by the current user.\nsyslog is used by pure unix apps and if you want central logging.\nOSX since 10.4 actually writes the logs to a database using asl\n\nA: Generally, the Console log contains log messages from processes owned by the currently logged-in GUI user, whereas the System log contains log messages from system processes owned by root or other \"system accounts\" (e.g. \"nobody\", \"www\", etc.).\n", "Q: How can I format Time Capsule?

Boehj’s answer provides a decent scripting option, but I personally prefer to use FFmpeg, so this is the Bash script I came up with to handle this task. Tested and works great in macOS Sierra (10.12.2).\nPerquisites: You should have ffmpeg and lame already installed on your Mac. The easiest way to do this is via Homebrew. First make sure you have Homebrew installed like this:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nThen run this command to install ffmpeg and lame:\nbrew install ffmpeg lame\n\nOnce that is done you are ready to run this script. This script will look for FLAC files in the directory path/to/FLAC/files but that can be changed to simply be . if the FLAC files are in the same directory you are running this script in.

For example, Pavement has a song titled “5-4=Unity” and if only the second chunk were selected via cut that title would have been truncated to “5-4”.\n\n*For track—and total track—numbers I added an extra pipe to sed which gets rid of leading zeros: sed 's/^0*//'.\n\n*In similar scripts around the Internet, the FFmpeg output is something like -f wav and that would actually compress the FFmpeg output which makes no sense in a pipe setup where LAME is going to re-encode it. Instead the output here is set to -f s16le -acodec pcm_s16le which is basically RAW output; perfect for piping audio to another process like this.\n\n*To deal with RAW output on the LAME side of the pipe, I had to add the -r option.\n\n*Also note the --tt, --ta, --tl, --tn and --tg ID3v2 tag options for LAME. When audio is streamed/piped from one process into LAME the the metadata from the source file is lost. One suggested option is to get FFmpeg to save the metadata to a text file by setting the option with -f ffmetadata \"[metadata filename here]\" and then running FFmpeg again with the something like this: -i \"[metadata filename here]\" -map_metadata 1 -c:a copy [destination mp3 file] id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1. That works, but note the requirement for a destination file. Seems like FFmpeg only imports metadata when it can copy the file which seems like a very wasteful process. Using FFprobe to get values and then setting them in LAME with --tt, --ta, --tl, --tn and --tg options works better; all the metadata is written in place so duplicate file needs to be generated.\n\n\nA: ffmpeg would preserve tags (but not cover art) by default.\nfor f in *.flac; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -aq 1 \"${f%flac}mp3\"; done\n\n-aq 1 corresponds to -V 1 in lame. -acodec libfaac would convert the files to AAC:\nfor f in *.flac; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -acodec libfaac -aq 200 \"${f%flac}m4a\"; done\n\n", "Q: Parallels Desktop is using my home directory for a VMs home directory I have installed Windows Vista on a Parallels Desktop virtual machine on my MacBook Air.\nBut it seem that my Windows Vista home directory is stored in my Mac OS X home directory.\nE.g. at my Mac OS X home directory /Users/jonas/ I also have my Vista folders:\nDocuments/\nApplications/\nDesktop/\nDownloads/\n\nI don't want to mix the environments like this. I want my Windows Vista files isolated to the virtual machine.\nHow can I keep my Windows Vista files to only exist within the virtual machine?\n\nA: I am assuming you did an Express installation. There is a few places in Parallels where the settings can or need to be changed.\nThe first place is under Configure -> Options -> Sharing.\n\nThis controls where and how Parallels can see the folders, and where and if they get mounted. Shared Profile is most likely enabled which is why you are getting the current result.\nAnother place to check sharing options would be under Configure -> Options -> Applications.\n\nThis controls which applications are shared between the Mac and Windows Virtual Machine and how they interact with each.\nLastly to completely disable sharing between the VM and Mac look under Configure -> Options -> Security\n\nThis will completely isolate the Mac from the VM, and nothing can be shared between the two.\n", "Q: Automatically move files when inserting SD card?

There is no problem in QuickTime. Why would there be in Final Cut Pro. Final Cut tells me that all files are 48,0KHz, 16-bit integer.\n\nA: What do the original files show up as in a media app such as VLC? Does this info match what Final Cut says about the ProRes copy? The video frame rate, audio sample rate, and other information should match exactly.  Then, your FCP sequence settings should be identical. \nAnother way to address small sync drifts is to razor-cut the audio and manually re-establish sync a few times on the project.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Is this true for the 2011 MacBook Pros?\n\nA: I replaced the stock 500GB 5400rpm hard drive in my Early 2011 Mac Book Pro (MacBook Pro 8,2) with a 120GB OWC Mercury Electra 6G SSD a few weeks ago. There was no thermal sensor attached to the stock drive. So far the replacement has worked fine, no issues at all. \nHardware Monitor application reports the temperature of the SSD, so the computer must be properly polling the internal temp sensor in the drive (over the SATA interface,) and/or there may be a permanent sensor attached near the drive on the inside of the MacBook Pro's case. (But not actually attached to the drive.)\nScreen capture of output from Hardware Monitor:\n\nThere was no difference in the software install process (vs. a regular hard drive.) In fact, I used 2 external cases (and a 3rd, separate, bootable drive) to do a block copy from the original 500GB to the new 120GB SSD. No issues.\nAbout TRIM support:\nThe drive itself is capable of it (See \"TRIM Support\" at the bottom of the specs page for this drive.), however, Mac OS X 10.8.2 does not support TRIM for this drive, at this time.  The drive vendor OWC says you don't need TRIM anyway because SandForce's firmware makes it unnecessary or even counterproductive. I agree with their explanation.\nScreen cap from my System Profiler:\n\nAs another data point on SSDs -- I had a 60GB OWC Mercury 3G SSD in a 2009 Mac Mini for about 3 years, never had any problems with it whatsoever.\n2013-04-30 UPDATE -- I had some firmware problems with the new 120 GB OWC Mercury 6G drive. The drive would not be recognized at system startup time without doing multiple (10 or more) PRAM & SMC resets. Finally it would \"catch on\" & then start up and run fine for weeks. Eventually it stopped responding altogether.  (OWC had suggested that I apply a firmware update, but I wasn't able to do this because I don't have a working DVD reader / writer.)\nI am returning the drive to OWC for a warranty replacement.

This has always been a big want for me. I love using multi-monitor setups but only want a single laptop. Does the 2011 MBP Thunderbolt support chaining multiple monitors together? I know that you can add a monitor and say, a few hard drives, but can you connect it to 2 27\" monitors and your flat screen TV (for example)? Thanks!\n\nA: It is possible now with the new MBP's and the new Thunderbolt displays.\n\nA: \"Any DisplayPort 1.1 device needs to be the last in a daisy chain.\"  So you will need some newer monitor (which doesn't seem to exist yet) in the middle.\n\nA: The MacBook Pro allows two Thunderbolt displays to be hooked up. apple.com/displays\n\n\nA: Apple maintains a knowledge base article listing which Mac models support either one or two external thunderbolt displays.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4885\nThe technology does allow for multiple monitors to be daisy chained. In fact, the devices you daisy chain doesn't matter, nor does the order they are in. However, like with the Display Port and eSATA, the problem at the moment is finding actual devices that support this feature. Until Apple or another manufacturer provides monitors with the ports needed for daisy chaining, this will not be possible.\nThe advantage here is unlike eSATA and Display Port, the bandwidth available will make this more then manageable from the port itself. The biggest obstacle will be the ability to provide enough power to run all these daisy chained devices. Therefore just getting a cable will not be sufficient. Each device will be required to have its own incoming and outgoing port.\nGive the technology another year or so it will be more then doable and more mainstream. Apple would most likely also add these ports to their monitors fairly soon, I suspect during the next iMac/Monitor refresh schedule.\n\nA: Now that the Thunderbolt Display has been released, we can safely say Yes! It even has a picture of it being used this way on the Thunderbolt Display's features page on Apple.com =D\n\nA: Talked to Apple reseller today, and they seemed to confirm that at the moment no such displays are available. There is also the challenge of providing power, and also how to mix different units (and also what about older standards which can be connected to Thunderbolt?), so I guess a lot has to happen in the time to come.

Is it OK to use my iPhone charger for charging other USB powered devices like the Kindle or a digital camera (with a rechargeable battery)? Can it cause any damage to the charger or to the device being charged?\n\nA: Yes, you can. It converts the AC power to the standard USB power, so anything that charges with USB will charge with the iPhone's adapter.\n\nA: Regarding to USB charging, there are two kinds of USB devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dumb ones that doesn't check if they are connected to a charger and always use less than 100 milliamperes. Some use up to 500mA, but they are out of USB specs.\n\n*Smart ones that check if they are connected to a charger and try to use full power of the charger (up to 1800mA or 2100mA).\n\n\nApple USB chargers (1000mA to 2100mA) are of the second type but doesn't follow the USB charging standard (1800mA) and aren't compatible with other smart devices that follow that standard. Only with dumb devices and other apple devices.\n\nA: Most standard USB charges for 0.5A. But not all USB are standardized - there are some that go for up to 1.8A and even the MacBook Pro is said to raise up to 1.1A when relevant. iPhone's charger do little more than 1.1A and it's pretty decent. That's why iPhone charging on regular USB usually take double the time to fully charge. iPad's charger are roughly 10W and 5V which translates to 2A.\nThere's nothing wrong that can happen with the charger because USB devices are made to work with the same standard voltage (about 5V). The USB hosts are only outputting the maximum energy it can provide up to what the client can receive. A 10W energy source will only give up to 10W and just 1W if the plugged device can only take 1W.\nI'm no electrical specialist but...\nHaving bigger power supply (measured in watts) or bigger current (measured in amperes) on itself can't break any system because what puts them in movement is the difference of potential measured by volts.\nThink of a light bulb and picture all USB devices are prepared to receive about 5V (actually little more). If you get a 220V and put in on a 110V nothing wrong happens, but it will be very weak. Apple's chargers only go up to 5V, which is within the USB standard. So yeah, it's all good and safe.\n\nA: Usually you can use the charger for other devices.  But check the power requirements of the device in question.  For instance an iPhone charger can't charge an iPad that's not sleeping (because it requires 10W and your iPhone charger is probably rated for 5W).\n\nA: This isn't always safe.  I tried charging a Kindle Fire with my Apple iPhone chargers and ended up burning out 2 of them. \n\nA: I have a Nuvi nav system with a mini-USB charging/sync port.  It hangs when plugged into a generic charger.   My theory is that the nuvi gets confused for some reason and tries to go into sync mode when it should just charge.  I don't know how the nuvi charger or cable is different than a generic USB charger or cable.\nSo caveat emptor.  But I would expect that it usually works across devices.\n\nA: My brother charged his Blackberry just great using his USB cable and my iPhone prongs-to-USB wall cube.\n\nA: My iPhone cube overheated when I used it to charge an external battery which wants 2.0 A. Using USB current meter the battery was pulling 1.5 A from the cube which caused it to quickly overheat. iPhone connected to cube pulled 0.7 A.\nWhen the external battery was connected to USB port on an old XP computer it pulled only 0.7 A during initial charging and even dropped to 0.6 A when 75% charged.\nIt seems that connecting the iPhone cube to a non-Apple source which wants 10 W (2 A) rather than 5 W (1 A) can cause the cube to attempt to deliver too much current and cause it to overheat and fail.\n\nA: Actually, all technicalities, manufacturers systematic operating schedules, and voltage/ amps/mA/ohms or any other current measurement aside...ALL COMPANIES manufacture product specific hardware and accessories ESPECIALLY Apple!! Otherwise what would be the point in manufacturing, buying, or choosing between different brands. In general vocabulary terms, all brands are different and work different. Putting too much or not enough current through any device in any manner is detrimental to that equipment. Broken down even more, YOU WILL BURN UP YOUR DEVICE/ BREAK IT!! They're may be a few cases that it will simply hinder performance, but why risk it?? not to mention, if you can afford Apple products in the first place, why are you cutting corners on cost of regular upkeep accessories ;) \n\nA: There is no doubt that  you can't because iPhone charger is not even the same as iPad charger. The full info about this you can read here\n\nA: Yes, you can and it is a very good charger. See:\nhttp://www.righto.com/2012/10/a-dozen-usb-chargers-in-lab-apple-is.html\nand:\nhttp://www.righto.com/2012/05/apple-iphone-charger-teardown-quality.html\n\nA: I have interchanged my chargers and devices for several years.  Not experiencing any problems, except my blackberry which has been finicky lately, only a few chargers work for it, and blackberry charger isn't one of them.\n", "Q: Restore iphone backup to windows A few months back I sold my Iphone 3G because I was going to get 4 instead. Unfortunately my windows machine crashed and I was forced to reinstall from scratch. I now plan to (finally) purchase the new one and I want to restore from my old backup. I copied everything from My Music folder on the old HDD to a the new one and I also copied everything from:\nAppdata\\Roaming\\Apple Computer to the new one. I though that would be enough but the backup is not showing up in Itunes.\nWhat can I do? I lost the old HDD completely after this.\n\nA: There is nothing you can do about it, if the HDD is really gone. If you don't have a backup of your old phone, then you just need to gather all the lost data from your memory.\nOf course, if you still have the HDD, you could try and take it to a shop that restores data from broken drives, maybe you'll get lucky.\n\nA: The backups are stored in this directory (I think it is the same for XP and Windows 7 but haven't checked):\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup \n\nYou could try some NTFS (assuming that was the format) recovery tools to try and get the data back. If you get the all the data from the backup you need you should be able to restore from that.\n", "Q: What manufacturer and model SSD drive are in the Early 2011 MacBook Pro? Thinking about getting the new MBP but cannot decide if the SSD upgrade is worth it; $100 dollars to bump to the 128 is small money but SSD drives vary widely in performance. trying to decide if I spend the $100 with apple or pick something better up at NewEgg.\n\nA: According to Anandtech it's a Samsung brand SSD.\n\nThe largest SSD maker in the world is Samsung. Samsung makes the drives offered by Apple in its entire MacBook/MacBook Pro lineup. Samsung makes the drives you get if you order a Lenovo X300. In fact, if you're buying any major OEM system with an SSD in it, Samsung makes that drive.\n\nI spoke with a few of the guys at work that replace these and they told me that they don't really pay attention to the brands, It's OEM. But the ones that he could remember where Samsung and Seagate.\nNow this doesn't speak to the brand that ships, but just what is replaced (if needed) when you bring it in for repair.\n\nA: My recommendation would be to not spend the money on the SSD from Apple and get the standard drive that it comes with. As well as Apple typically places a premium price on parts from them.\nThen you have the time to research the best SSD for your needs and at your own leisure pace. You will also have the original HDD to fall back to if you ever need it. \nOr you could choose to remove the optical drive and install a drive cage and use both the SSD and HDD. I think that OWC sells a cage for that option.\n\nA: Toshiba in the MacPros, and according to anandtech, the MacBookAir has the same controller as the Kingston, which is by Toshiba.  No reason they'd still be using samsung\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/3991/apples-2010-macbook-air-11-13inch-reviewed/4\n\n", "Q: Jailbroken iPhone dead; What firmware \"load\" options do I have? I jailbroke my original iPhone first gen to version 3.14 (I think) and since then I'm unable to use the phone. \nI've done this before and never once had an issue (so I'm semi-experienced with this).\nSymptoms\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes says the phone is in recovery mode.  \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The screen looks like a newly loaded (not activated phone)\n\n\n\nAttempts to fix\n\n\n*\n\n*I've loaded almost every original (not jailbroken) ipsw from 3.0 to the latest one (for this model) and am not able to get back to defaults. I get the following error:\n\n\n*I've loaded many different Jailbreak programs and none of them can make the phone work.\nI'm OK if I don't ever get cellular service and just use it as an iPod Touch.  Anyone know how I can get past this screen in either jailbroken or original mode?\n\nA: From every piece of literature I can find on the topic, and my own past experience, this normally indicates a hardware failure. Your best bet would be to take it to your nearest Apple store and they might be able to assist.\n\nA: if I remember well, since 3.1.3 you can't reinstall firmware on jailbreaked phones with itunes. I had the same problem and 3.1.2 restore worked without problem.\nneeded for iphone 2g:\nBL-39.bin and BL-46.bin boot loaders files\nresdn0w-win_0.9.4 - to jailbreak - other versions were not working with the restore file below\niPhone1,1_3.1.2_7D11_Restore.ipsw - restore file worked with itunes 10\nI'm sure you can find these files easily for download.\n", "Q: Swapping existing hard drive into new laptop I'm currently running 10.6.6 and my MBP has a nice and speedy SSD in it.\nMy plan is to replace my current laptop with one of the new ones just announced today.\nIs it possible to simply take the SSD out of my current laptop and plop it into the new one having to do nothing other than that?  I know the new MBPs have different graphics cards, the new thunderbolt port, etc...  Does any of that hold me back from my swap idea?\n\nUPDATE:\nBased on some of the comments below my thinking is now:\n\n\n*\n\n*SuperDuper! backup of my existing system to external HD (I still have a firewire disk I can use for this since I don't think TDM works over USB)\n\n*Boot to that backup via target disk mode \n\n*Update to the latest OS X 10.6.6 on the firewire disk using the combo update\n\n*Boot the new laptop to the same disk via TDM and test\n\n*If all goes well, run the combo update on the SSD in the old MBP\n\n*Swap\n\n\nGood idea?  Too much?\n\nA: If you are moving to a MBP with a different chipset than what you currently have, and since it's a new revision it will be all new hardware, then you can do the SSD transfer but you will get a lot of issues with driver and system compatibility.\nThe best thing would be to do a Time Machine backup of you current system, install the SSD, fresh install of OSX, and during the user registration restore your data from a Time Machine backup.\n\nA: On the contrary.\nEven if your system is fully updated, force apply the latest combo update before plopping the SSD in the new MBP. All drivers for the new hardware are in there. \nI did this some time ago with a 500Gb 7200 rpm Seagate drive, with 10.6.0, moved from a mini model A1176 to a then new mini model A1283.\nThe first boot in the new system was rather slow, then the system rebooted by itself, before reaching the login page. After that all was normal.\nJust to be on the safe side, you may want to have a backup of vital data.\n\nA: All the new devices would be the only problem you might face. I would think that as long as both machines have the same version of OS X there won't be a problem. As a test you could start your old machine in target mode and use it as the boot disk in the new computer. Assuming it boots and there isn't a kernel panic the new hardware (thunderbolt, GPU, etc) should just add themselves to the system.\n", "Q: How to make a KVR1333D3S9 work with a MacBook Pro 7.1? I recently bought a couple of memory modules from Kingston to be used on my MacBookPro 13\" 7.1, they are KVR1333D3S9/4G which should work fine with the computer as the frequency and latency is supported, but when I installed them OSX will never boot, it stops on DSMOS as arrived.\nThe only way I fount to make it work is using one of the KVR and one os those that the computer originally had. But then the memory works at 1067 and worse,I don't have 8GB but only 6.\nGoogling I found that I should had to buy a certified memory, and I know, I should googled a bit more before buying this memory, but I don't want to give up, not now.\nDoes any of you have a \"trick\" for this kind of memory to work.\n\nA: There really isn't any trick for running RAM that your Mac doesn't like. It appears that Mac OS X is more forgiving of RAM problems in Safe Mode (which makes sense, when you think about it).\nBut it sounds as though one or both of the Kingston memory modules is bad. I suggest that you install one of the modules, then boot normally and run Memtest, then swap that module for the other one, and run Memtest again.\nYou can get Memtest for free at this link:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=788590\nIf one module is bad, then exchange it. If both modules test OK, then you are still best off returning them to where you bought them for an exchange.\n\nA: The problem is that the 7,1 chipset supports 1333mHz, but the onboard video crashes. Here is my answer to a similar question. Basicly you should do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Combine 1333 & 1066 MHz DIMMs (and system will run fine on 1066MHz)\n\n*Flash the DIMMs SPD (to make it report 1066 MHz speed). (I did that successfully).\n\n*Buy new 1066MHz DIMMs\n\n\nA: I've the same problem. Identical modules reference. I think that Kingston needs more power to run properly, so now I'm going to try with another type of memory like Corsair.\n", "Q: iPhone Music Playing App That Uses Album Artist? I have a lot of compilation albums where each track is by a different artist, but I have the Album Artist tag set to \"Various Artists\" (or in the case of some soundtracks, the main artist's name).\nHowever, when viewing my music by artist in the iPhone's iPod app, it lists all the track artists, creating a miasma of artist listings with only one or two songs under them.\nIs there an iPhone app out there that lists by Album Artist instead, which would be a lot more manageable and frankly, makes a lot more sense?\n\nA: Since there are no answers to this question yet, and all the discussion took place in comments, let's write a summary. And please, up vote the relevant author in their comments on the question itself. Please please please.\nPer @ghoppe;\nWhen using the iPod app in list view (list view = the view with selections for your chosen category), the \"More …\" category on the very bottom right hand side has a few additional options, name there is \"Compilations\" view.\nThis view is identical to Album view, except it only shows albums that have two or more unique artists in it.\nIf this is a view you use often, you could put it on the category bar so it's quick/easy to get to. Perhaps a customization like: \"Artist - Compilations - Songs - Videos - More …\"\nThis of course does nothing to prevent seeing compilations when in an Artist entry.\n(More is required and cannot be replaced nor moved.)\nMy suggestion was to default your browsing habits to using Album view instead. Instead of picking a song by an artist, you will always see a track-ordered list of songs after picking an album.\nThere's also the search box you can use to type in an artist/album, and pick the relevant view you want from it (scroll to the top of any view, or if you're already at the top swipe down once more to pull the top down, and the search box will be revealed).\n", "Q: TFTP Server on 10.6.6 How do I enable an existing TFTPd within 10.6.6 ?\n\nA: Do you need to run it with any special settings?  By default, it runs chrooted in /private/tftpboot; if you want anything different in the setup, edit /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist as appropriate.  Then, activate it with:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist\n\n", "Q: Tap to click only on Magic Trackpad Is there a way to configure the Magic Trackpad with tap-to-click without having tap-to-click on the built-in trackpad of a MacBook Air?\n\nA: Have you already taken a look at MagicPrefs (free)? It lets you assign custom actions to various gestures and touches, maybe this will let you realise what you want. Since I don´t have a Magic Trackpad near me, I can´t verify this though.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to have tap to click on the external magic trackpad only. First disconnect the magic trackpad and ensure tap to click is disabled in system preferences. Then run\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool true\n\nWhen you reconnect the magic trackpad, it should have tap to click enabled without the internal trackpad having tap to click.\nFor reference, to enable tap to click on the internal trackpad you can do\ndefaults read com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad Clicking\n\nBut this will require a reboot. Disclaimer that this was only tested on 10.9.5 (with magic trackpad v1)\n", "Q: How do I temporarily exclude a folder from a search? I often use spotlight to locate documents quickly.

Is there any free RSS reader client for Mac that can give me a notification if there are new posts to read?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, NetNewsWire does this.\nIt's free, but ad-supported; you can pay extra to remove the ads.\n\nA: Use Mail.app and set it up as a filter in Mail Preferences->RSS.\n\nA: Vienna.\n\nA: Though it will eventually be a paid app in the Mac App Store, the Reeder beta is currently free. It's a very well-designed, highly polished app that's actually gotten me back into reading RSS feeds:\n\nIf you need a notification for new posts to read, you can configure Reeder to display a count of unread RSS items in the dock:\n\n\nA: Or you can use Google Chrome and the Google Reader Notifier.\nHopefully Google will build this in reader in the next update.

Without individually setting the ringtone for each contact in that group. \nMaybe there are other apps that manage contacts and have this feature. \nBasically, I want my iPhone to ring the same when contacts from a group call. \n\nA: This is a feature that I want Apple to support, but hasn't yet. The \"Group\" mechanism in Contacts is a distribution list and only allows you to group contacts but has no editable meta information for you to change (for example, to change the default ringtone).\nOn an un-hacked iPhone, your only option is to edit individual contacts, and assign the new ringtone for each of them.\nI have never hacked my iPhone, so there might be alternative methods available that I am not aware of. I will let someone else with a hacked iPhone answer that part.\n", "Q: Can I use my iPad to organize photos that are stored externally?  I would like to organize my photos with iPad (remove, edit, create albums etc).\nI have the synology NAS and I can run the Photo app on the NAS (server) and I can use the DS Photo+ app on iPad (client) but this app can be used only as a viewer (I can't organize photos).\nI also have the Aperture on the Mac and I can use the iTunes to sync the photos to the iPad but it is the same problem as with the NAS. I can't delete the photos or organize them in any way - it is only a viewer.\nI have around 100k photos and I have to keep them externally. Thus, I have to use the iPad only as a remote viewer (client).

This is even when using the IP-number as the host to connect to.\nAny idea why this happens and how I can work around it?\n\nA: Don't forward local port 3389, various versions of Remote Desktop are too smart for their own good.\nMy usual steps involve forwarding local 3390 to remote 3389. Then, in MacRDC I use: localhost:3390 as the address to connect too.\nI don't know if you're using anything to assist in the ssh connection setup, but from the command line, it would be something like:\nssh -L 3390:172.16.5.32:3389 jason@remote.net\nWhere;\n - 3390 is the local forwarding port on my box.\n - 172.16.5.32 is the remote windows host. and;\n - 3389 is the Remote Desktop Port (obviously).\n\nA: On your mac, perhaps try out this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*install sshuttle ( implements ssh tunnel/proxy, but also implements some routing changes ) ( https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle.git )\n\n*configure sshuttle to only route for the ip address of the windows box you want to reach:\nsshuttle --dns -r YourUserName@YourSSHBox.com 1.1.1.1/32 \nReplace:\n1.1.1.1/32 with the ip address of the windows host. If there are a number of hosts you need to access and they are in the same subnet, you can just change the /32 to something wider, say /24. \n\n*Fire up your Mac RDP client and attempt to access the IP address of the Windows machine. Perhaps can use the hostname if you are also forwarding DNS queries to the box you are using as a bridge.\nThis is a variation of the -D3389 method, but employs the socks proxy features of ssh.\n\nA: The Windows Remote Desktop implements more authentication and encryption algorithms specific to Windows. This happened to us often, in fact we're forced to use Windows Remote Desktop by our network administrators as we're using authentication methods OSX doesn't implement. Let's cross fingers and hope Microsoft releases a match for the Windows-grade Remote Desktop asap.\n\nA: Did you try to disable requirement for \"Network Level Authentication\" from \"Control Panel -> System -> Allow Remote Access\" on the target machine?\n\n\nA: Try CoRD: enter link description here\nI've found it works better than the official RDP client and tends to handle imperfect setups smoother.\n\nUpdate to this answer from the CoRD site\n\n2020-04-13: This project is defunct. Most people will be happy with Microsoft's clients. There's also an excellent free and open source project called FreeRDP that has great protocol support for multiple platforms. A sincere thanks to everyone who used CoRD over the years, reported bugs, donated, or contributed code - Dorian\n\n\nA: The OSX Microsoft Remote Desktop client does not seem to support the default authentication method used by Windows 7+\nThe solution is to do the following on the Windows machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start -> Edit Group Policy\n\n*Computer configuration \n\n\n*\n\n*Administrative Templates\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows Components\n\n\n*\n\n*Remote Desktop Services\n\n*Remote Desktop Session Host\n\n\n*\n\n*Security\n\n\n*\n\n*Change 'Require use of specific for remote desktop (RDP) connections' to Enabled and choose RDP from the dropdown.\n\n*Change 'Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentications' to Disabled\nNow you should be able to connect using the OSX Remote Desktop Client without any problems through the SSH tunnel.\n\nA: Forwarding to port 3389 is bound to give you trouble. The system will recognize what you're trying to do and basically short circuit itself. This is the drawback of DIY Remote Desktop, imho.\n", "Q: Why are iChat and FaceTime separate programs? What might be the idea behind this?\n\nA: First and foremost because they use different protocols. \nFaceTime was created as an implementation of a new protocol for video calls. Apple has pledged to release this protocol/format in the future with hopes of other software vendors adopting it so there is opportunity for interoperability.\niChat uses a variety of protocols for chat interaction, most of which were originally designed to carry text as a payload. Video in most cases was something added to these protocols after the fact.\nConsider iChat the 'legacy' way of handling video and FaceTime the new way.\n", "Q: I just bought the wrong album on iTunes.

In older versions of iTunes (for Windows at least), there used to be a way to Deauthorize all computers associated with an account. \nNow it appears the only option in 10 (10.1.2.17) is to Deauthorize this computer... and removes only the one I'm on. Has the option to Deauthorize All disappeared or has it been moved somewhere else?\nMy reason behind needing this: One of the authorized computers had a hard drive failure and I just wanted to clean up the computers I have authorized.\n\nA: From this Apple Support article you can do it from your account.\n\nIf you find you have reached 5 authorizations, you can reset your authorization count by clicking Deauthorize All in the Account Information screen.\n\nThe process works as follows\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Click iTunes Store in the menu on the left side of iTunes.\n  \n*If you're not signed in to the store, click the Account button, then enter your account name and password.\n  \n*Click the Account button again (your ID appears on the button), enter your password, and then click View Account.\n  \n*In the Account Information window, click Deauthorize All.\n  \n\n\nAlso note the following:\n\nYou may only use this feature once per year.

I had always thought the answer to this was no. I have an app that was pulled from the iOS App Store (VLC) still on my non-jailbroken phone and thought this was proof that Apple can't remote wipe an app. But I just heard a claim that they can remote wipe apps installed via their app purchase portals if they choose.\nIs this true? True for just iOS apps or just App Store apps?\n\nA: Yes, it's true Apple can remotely delete apps. This is a failsafe in case a nefarious app accidentally makes it past the review process. Not sure about Mac App store, I doubt the ability exists there. It's a different installation/update process.\nI don't think it's been done before, and I wouldn't worry about it. It's a good thing. I would want an app that say sniffs my credit card numbers or is actually a trojan horse of some kind to be removed from my iPhone post haste.\n\nA: I think it might be possible. \nYou never know until it happens. If I were in a company that screened all sold applications so closely, then I'd keep the option available. Someone could slip a harmful app through the screening process, and if you could remote wipe all the bad apps, then you wouldn't loose rep for it. :D\nBut as you say yourself, they haven't deleted apps like VLC, I have it too on my iOS. \nBesides, if you sync apps to your itunes, you always have a hard copy of them in your iTunes library, so don't know if wiping would help :D\n", "Q: 3ds Max alternative for Mac Is there a good alternative to Autodesk's 3D modeling software 3ds Max that works on a Mac? \nI like 3ds Max because it's very powerful and easy to use for someone who is not an expert in 3D modeling.\nI tried Blender, but it was really hard to understand and control, and I found its commands to be very counter-intuitive.\n\nA: Autodesk's Maya has a Mac version.\nI can't say I've used it, but it's quite popular.\n\nA: It's not as feature-laden as 3DS Max, but like Blender, Art of Illusion is free and cross-platform, so it can't hurt to have a look.\n\nA: I was always a big, big fan of Carrara back when I was working with 3D software, and it looks as though the non-Pro version still packs a lot of punch.\n\nA: You can give Cinema4D a try. Personally I find it even easier to understand than 3dsMax.\n\nA: I'd second Maya if you want a professional app that natively runs on a mac. I use it for architectural visualization.\nHowever if you already own a 3DS Max Version why not run it on your mac via Bootcamp or Parallels. Autodesk even supports this kind of usage of their software.\nhttp://usa.autodesk.com/products/mac-compatible-products\nA license of parallels + windows might be cheeper than spending the extra money (and time training) on a new software.\n\nA: You can Use Archicad, is for Architecture but it has a powerful tool called morph that works just fine to me, then you can export the file to 3ds or c4d. You should give a try with that one.\n", "Q: Change Spotlight's Top Hit? Say I have two apps that match a search in spotlight (e.g. utility), it seems that Spotlight chooses the first application (sorted alphabetically) as the Top Hit. Is there any way to change this so that a different application appears on top?\n\nA: Just use some other launcher. Alfred is also good at learning new associations. If for example you select \"Disk Utility\" after typing \"ut\", it will become the new default suggestion for \"ut\". Very low-maintenance.\nYou could also try Apptivate. It allows you to assign 2-letter shortcuts (like ⌥UT) for launching applications.\n\nA: Try adding a Tag to the item to see if that helps.\n\n\n*\n\n*focus on the item and cmd+I to Get Info.\n\n*In the \"Add Tags\" field, add something like utility.\n\n\nIn my experience, the Tags seem to bump up the item in Spotlight.\n\nA: One way is to drag the application into the Applications folder (if it isn't already there), and rename it so that it appears on top (e.g. - My Utility).\n", "Q: Can I daisy chain multiple displays with Thunderbolt? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDoes Thunderbolt support chaining multiple monitors to a MacBook Pro? \n\nThis question is a follow up to this question I found on this site.\nIf I have a monitor that supports DisplayPort, will it be possible (with a Mini Display Port to DisplayPort cable) to have my monitor (Dell U2711) at the end of a Thunderbolt daisy chain?\n\nA: Currently the port on the MacBook Pro is both a DisplayPort and a Thunderbolt port. The limitation, as already explained in the other question, is only relevant to DisplayPort, which has to be the last device in the chain, if daisy chained. \nSo in short, and in theory, it should work. According to the Thunderbolt page, you can plug in any adapter for DisplayPort and it should work, as long as the device also supports it.\nThe only time this gets really complex, is when you need to both power the device and use it using just the one port. If the device has external power, it shouldn't cause any major problems daisy chaining, however, the DisplayPort device still needs the last device in the chain. Simply because it cannot transfer data at the speed and rate the Thunderbolt can.\n\nA: Only if you don't have a Thunderbolt display in the chain.  According to Apple, you can daisy-chain two Thunderbolt displays on compatible systems, but not non-Thunderbolt displays (such as the LED Cinema Display, which uses Mini DisplayPort, or others via a Mini DisplayPort adapter).\nOtherwise, it works fine.\n", "Q: Battery Life on Macbook Pro I've got a 15\" macbook pro, i5 2.4ghz which I've inherited. When I use it to watch video -- with the notebooks monitor turned off, video piped to an external monitor - the battery dies in 90 - 120min. \nIs this normal? Does that mean its time to replace the battery? What sort of life should I be expecting?\n\nA: You can check the battery's capacity to see if there's a problem with that. I use the free CoconutBattery. It will give you the percentage of the battery's full capacity (what it had when it shipped) that it has at this point.\nIt's possible that you may have some errant process running that are eating up your battery. Open Activity Monitor and click the CPU column head so that it sorts by CPU usage. Is there anything there that shouldn't be?\n\nA: If you're powering a large external display, it's possible that the GPU is having to work harder than it would for the internal display, which might lead to reduced battery life.\nAlso, if I recall correctly, since Mac OS X 10.5 it's not possible to only drive an external display on battery power - the steps required to do so (connect display, close clamshell, wake with USB) don't work unless power is attached. So if by \"turning off\" the internal display you just turn down the brightness, be aware that your Mac is still using GPU power to put content on that display even if you can't see it.\n\nA: I recommend CoconutBattery too. For a battery refresh (with perhaps better capacity after that) you have to run your MBP in battery mode until it turns out itself. Then you have to wait until the white LED doesn't pulse. Then you should recharge your MBP to full capacity and keep it at the power for some more hours.\n", "Q: OS X Downloaded File Warning Example at bottom.\nHow does OS X apply this warning and what's the best way to disable it? \nI'm a Web Developer and more than understand the risks of teh interwebs.\n\n\nA: Use the Terminal and this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO\n\nThat will disable warnings completely after you restart the system. To reverse it, run it again with \"YES\" instead of \"NO\".\nOr you can create a custom listing of safe files with the method described here:\nCustom assessment file for downloaded files\n", "Q: Loose light up apple logo on unibody macbook case The light-up Apple logo inset into on the back of my 13\" Unibody MacBook (this thing) has come loose and is recessed into the lid.

I upgrading my version of windows and I forgot to backup my iTunes music, is there a way I can re-download it from iTunes without buying it all again?\n\nA: Send Apple a support email to the iTunes Store (e.g. by using this form). Tell them what happened and they should allow you to redownload all of your old purchases. That's what they did for me. You won't be able to redownload content that has changed on the store. It seems as though some songs get removed and then readded so their IDs won't match the same ones you purchased. I was able to redownload about 95% of my purchases.\nRegardless of whether or not you agree with their policy of not allowing you to redownload purchased content; please don't abuse their generosity, and try to back it up yourself next time.\n\nA: No.\nSend them an email about your sob story, you never know.\n(Lesson learned. Backup always. Especially before upgrades.)\n\nA: As per http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519, you can redownload any music you have bought on iTunes by going to the \"Purchased\" page in the iTunes Store and downloading them from there. \nIf the item is still in the iTunes library (for instance, if for some reason you backed up iTunes' library files but not the actual media), you need to delete them from the library before you can download them again. \n", "Q: What is a good program for timing activities? I am looking for a program to time projects and activities, both computer- and real life-based, allowing me to tell him to start and stop timing this or that activity, in a very light, background, non-invasive way, and possibly keping past data about time intervals spent on various activities.\nI have been trying out such a program called TrackTime, but it is (at least on my 10.5 MacBook) quite slow to react, and cannot show easily data for more than five or so activities.\nAny suggestion for such a program?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everybody for your answers, but I am not sure I have yet found what I am looking for. For instance, while I appreciate the usefulness of these features, I am not interested in iCal integration, nor in the ability to create invoices.\nBasically, what I am looking for is just a sort of \"multi-timer\", in which each timer can be easily started/stopped, and which logs the timings in any readable form. It may well be, as someone suggested, that it can be done with just some script.\n\nA: I am listing the apps I have looked at so far. I must emphasize that none of them really solves the problem stated above perfectly.\nHere's what I have looked at so far based on my google doc list\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Job looks great, but the developer seems to have abandoned it. At least he does not really fix bugs and is very slow to respond to his user base.\n\n*Timings light-weight but the UI to create clients, projects and tasks can be confusing. I am testing it right now. A friend uses it and says it crashes sometimes though it has not happended to me yet.\n\n*Harvest looks good, it does have a desktop client itself and an API that is used by lots of apps. But it is subscription-only which is a no-go for me and costs at least $12 per month.\n\n*The same goes for Toggl: looks good, but is subscription-based and costs $5 per month\n\n*iBiz and timeEdition have been discontinued\n\n*Klok is an Adobe Air app. The UI feels weird. Small typography, limited support for keyboard shortcuts and complex interface.\n\n*OfficeTime feels like the best match so far but the UI is very cluttered (see this screenshot of the Generate Bill dialog as an example). It feels a bit like a Windows app that has been ported to Mac but I am not sure if that's true.\n\n*Timecop is a very minimal approach. There is no way to test it without paying the $6.99 price. Has not been updated for 9 months, twitter account has been inactive for 5 months.\n\n*Tictoc seems very similar to Timecop. No way to test without buying either. \n\n\nA: I haven't found the one I like and I created it myself, Qbserve.\nIt fits most of your requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*native stand-alone macOS app\n\n*detects idle time\n\n*comes for a flat fee ($40)\n\n*supports projects and tracks time for them automatically (based on opened documents and web pages) but it's also possible to assign time manually\n\n*generates invoices from the tracked time\n\n\nIt also automatically recognizes productivity for sites, apps, and chats (you can assign Skype chats and Slack teams to different categories).\nPlus all the tracked information is stored locally on your machine in an SQLite database.\n\n\nA: I'd like to recommend my own app Timing (see the screenshot below). It automatically tracks which documents you edit, which websites you visit and which apps you use, so that you can later review what exactly you have done. You can also manually add offline activities so that they don't get lost.\n\n\nA: I like/use Billings.\n\nA: Been using Tyme for quite a while and pretty happy about it. Available for OSX ($9.99) and iOS($3.99).\n\nA: Not sure it'll do everything you've asked for, but Time Sink is pretty powerful and can generate a variety of reports. Its almost free at $5 and you can try it for 14-days. It can also run in a menu bar only mode so its out of the way.\n \n\nA: TimeLog, Chronories or TaskTime4?\n\nA: I strongly recommend Minco, which has tons of customisation features, but sits quietly in the menubar.\nIn fact, it's SO unobtrusive that I sometimes forget to use it! \nBut it's very slick app, and has a free trial if you download from the developer's website.\nIt's also available on the Mac App Store. \nI'm not affiliated -- I just think it's a great product because it looks awesome, works very well and has plenty of hooks into iCal (and options for logging activities to calendars and even dynamically writing a text-file that can be imported into a spreadsheet or other apps later)\nVery nice app. \n\nA: OfficeTimer (app)\nSlife (web-based)\nRescueTime (web-based)\nOther good time-based apps (that dont answer the question):\nAlarmClockPro, Cuppa\n\nA: As an associate of Touch Studios, an app developing company, I recommend our time-tracking app Finch. Finch does time tracking in an automated way: With the option to start the program on login, it runs in the background, records what windows you have open, and learns how to tag them based on your customized preferences and past behavior. At the end of the day, you get a bar chart showing where your time went. It's a really great app if you have trouble with the traditional 'stopwatch' type apps.\n\nA: WakaTime is an open-source Xcode plugin for automatic time tracking.\nFeatures:\n\n*\n\n*Fully automatic\n\n\n*Detects project name from revision control software\n\n\n*Language breakdown showing your most-used programming languages\n\n\n*Monthly, weekly, or daily email summaries\n\n\n*Open-source text editor plugins available on GitHub.\n\n\nA: I use Time Track Pro available in the MAS and more information is available from the vendor site at http://bloop.it/timetrack/ .\nThe application is efficient, using minmal CPU resources, sits in the menubar (low visual footprint), can automate emailing of weekly reports if you like, and more. \nI've used it for two months and it is great to track the particular documents and projects I'm in. At 9.99 it may be a little more cost than other tools, but I'm happy supporting a good developer here so I've no issue with the value of this software.\n\nA: My personal favorite is Paymo Plus \nit tracks everything you do, even the individual tabs. On the upside it's great to know how much you're actually working, on the downside, it makes you work harder. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I've started looking at TimeLime. It's a paid app available on the Mac App Store. I've heard a lot of good things about it from other users I've chatted with.\n\nA: You should have a look at Caato Time Tracker. http://www.caato.de/timetracker\n\nA: If one is interested in a more basic (and hackable) solution there is selfspy - a Python command line tool that tracks keystrokes, active applications, mouse activity and other stuff. Reports are comprehensive and can be email to you automatically. Everything is stored in a sqlite database file. The tool is well documented and the source code comprehensible. \nhttps://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy \n\nA: I've personally been using RescueTimefor a long time now.\nThe Premium version is based on a subscription (monthly or annually), so it may not fit your need, but there is also a free version, which is enough in my case.\nThe data is collected automatically from a Desktop application, the dashboard and settings are web-based.\nI used TimeSink which is a Mac application available on the Mac App Store. It is a \"buy once\" application, cheap, light, but does not have so many features. \nI like the way activity is displayed: every application has its own timeline, so you can really keep track of your day.\nI also used Time Track Pro for some time. I like the way data is displayed with vertical stacks. The Application is cheap, light, and available on the AppStore, but it hasn't been updated in a while.\nFinally there is Timing, also available on the M.A.S.\n\nA: I'm using ActivityWatch for about half a month and it really like it. So I recommend you try it :)\nBy the way, there you can use the Stopwatch tab to manually track anything ;)\n                     \n\nActivityWatch is an open-source automated time tracker that’s\ncross-platform, extensible, and privacy-first.\nWe started building it years ago because we wanted highly detailed\nautomated time tracking without having to run a proprietary app (that\nmight not work on all platforms) or worse, sending it off to some\ncompany server.\nFeatures:\n\n*\n\n*Tracking – Tracks active application and window title out of the box, more with watchers.\n\n*Categories – Get a better overview of your usage by breaking it down into categories.\n\n*Browser extensions – Track the active tab using the extensions for Chrome and Firefox.\n\n*Editor plugins – Track how you spend time writing code with editor watchers.\n\n*Privacy – Data is stored locally and doesn't leave your device, we put local and privacy first.\n\n*Cross-platform – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.\n\n\nOriginaly posted by Erik Bjäreholt on Quora\n\nIf you want just to track computer activites, another option is to use the built-in Screen Time app, which is however only available in macOS Catalina or later...\n\nA: ChronosX\nI've only been using it for less than a full day, but it seems to work well, tracking precisely how much time you spend in each app and, most of the time, telling you which document or web page was foremost at the time.\nThe downsides are that it only seems to store stuff in iCal, which has been pretty awkward so far; it exports in .odf which is a useless format unless you install Open Office or something similar; and it crashes at the end of the export.\nStill, it seems to track time well and it has a 30 day free trial, so it's worth a try.\n\nA: I use rescuetime. It categorizes applications, websites and documents on how helpful these are towards your productivity.\nIt also shows how much time you've spent on distracting applications, documents and websites like facebook, games and such.\n\nA: I've been looking at TimeTrack 2 for a similar reason, though I like it because it's supposed to report time intervals back to FogBugz for me. While the FB integration is somewhat broken right now, the actual standalone timer functionality of the software is pretty good. The price seems a little steep and if you read through the GetSatisfaction posts for the app the support and feature updates aren't great (I was the first person to generate any activity in their bug DB in 25 days and the outstanding bug reports have been stale for quite some time).\n\nA: As the FAQ seems to allow, I add an answer to my own question.\nI have had a look to Time Tracker (free) and Cronograph (€19.95), which seem to have some features in common. Both are quite non-intrusive, allow creating projects and tasks within each project, and to time single tasks (no more than one task at a time). No invoices, client handling and the like, which are things I personally do not need.\nI have been trying out mostly the first one, with good results so far. \n\nA: I use TimeThis (http://timethis.merryfools.com/). I'm a lawyer, so I use it all day everyday. It's $30 flat fee. The primary use case seems to be integration with various services (for me, it's the old basecamp with time tracking). It has a built-in feature that recognizes inactivity, but I'm not sure it's tied to screensaver/sleep at all. The killer feature for me was that it pulls Project/list/task info from Basecamp so I don't have to type my entry each time.\nI previously used Klok (http://www.getklok.com/features.html), which is similar. It's been a while, so I'm not certain if they cleaned up the spreadsheet export feature that was just clunky in the past. The visual metaphor helps identify untracked time as it happens, which is very helpful.\n\nA: I'm an author of Litt time tracker application - maybe you will find it useful for you.\nApplication website is http://satorilight.com currently. \nIt has features that you mentioned - ability to stop tracking on idle intervals.\nAlthough it is not tied directly to screensaver stop/start events.\nApplication is freeware and in beta stage now - but I use for few months already. \nApplication is not signed yet - Gatekeeper will warn on it.\n\nA: I feel you, none of the apps out there fit me either, so i built my own. It works by taking timestamps when an event happens, like git commits, looking in the browser and computer sleeps. It can read the calendar as well. At the end of the day it will calculate how long did you spent on your tasks. Then it can save the report to Jira. http://www.jirassic.com For now is a free time tracking mac app.\n\nA: I have tried three time tracking apps in total.\nHubstaff, Staff Timer App and Time Doctor. All of them works perfectly fine in windows but for Mac OS, I find Staff Timer App \nmost easy to use the app. You can add different team members and assign each task to each member and in the end see the total time spend on each task.\n\nA: Check out TimeXchange. www.timexchange.net\n\nA: I recommend you try using Time Doctor. It’s a good tool for measuring how much time (automated) you spent working on the computer. It has multiple ways to confirm if the time tracked was real and the time was a genuine working time such as checking websites visited and software applications used on the computer.  I’m one of the satisfied users of this software that’s why I am recommending this to everyone…\n\nA: https://hubstaff.com does this but you need to select the project manually.  At the end of the day, you can see all the projects that you've worked on for that day, week, month, etc... and the exact amount of time spent on each.\n\nA: I would suggest you to go with the advanced version of apps, the cloud based app which could help keep track of the time in an hourly format and the lost of data which might be a risk in desktop app will be quite less. \nBut still if you are looking for some desktop app then \n\n\n*\n\n*rescuetime\n\n*timedoctor\n\n*replicon\nwould be good choices.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Windows 7 boot with BootCamp? I installed Windows 7 (from MSDNAA) with BootCamp on my MBP (late 2008). After using the BootCamp utility on OSX I restarted the computer and the installation of Win7 began. This first time, there were no partitions to choose as destination. After a restart, I could install Win7 on the Bootcamp partition.\nNow every time I try to start Win7, a black screen appears and nothing happens anymore. I tried it with hitting \"alt\" and choosing windows from the boot menu, I tried rEFIt and choosing windows, I tried selecting windows from the startup disk menu in OSX...

Tried everything and it turned out to be the RAM.  I put back in the factory RAM, installed boot camp, then put back my newer RAM after it worked.\nIt may not be your issue, but thought I would try.\n\nA: Sounds like a display driver related issue, try booting windows into Safe Mode by pressing the F8 key as soon as Windows starts.\n\nA: Do you have a CD/DVD in drive when trying to boot to Windows?

Just try and remove all external devices (also USB mice etc) and discs and see if it works.\nI haven't found a way to alter the boot preferences for the emulated BIOS yet.\n\nA: It will work in OS Lion. It was reported that the developer build of OS Lion will ONLY work with Windows 7 in Boot Camp.\nI know it doesn't solve the issue right now, but it's good to know about.\n\nA: I have had this multiple times, I had to connect an external display because it was some driver issue with the iMac's display, and update the drivers within windows to resolve.\nGood thing I had a projector handy.\n", "Q: How can I scroll down to the bottom of document (HTML) in Safari?

Is it possible to delete any of the default apps in OS X? I suppose it is possible, but will anything break if I do?\nThere's some, such as Stickies, iChat, Dictionary, etc. that I either have no use for, or have replaced with my own apps that provide similar functions.\nThanks guys!\n\nA: Sure, you can just delete them. When system updates are applied, though, they may \"reappear\" and not function as the updater may just blithely write the files, assuming the apps have not been moved or deleted. \nWhy delete them? They don't take up much space and you can remove them from the Dock. I don't use Dictionary or Chess either, but it's not an issue sitting there unused.\nOn second thought, you may not want to remove Dictionary, as there are some system-level things that get definitions, and the definitions might only be in the app bundle.\n\nA: Instead of Uninstalling these apps, you could just hide them.\nDoing this in Terminal:\nsudo chflags hidden /Applications/Chess.app\nWill hide the application from sight, but will still be there.\nHere is the link for the source:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20091229093051878\n\nA: It's also pretty annoying to try to reinstall them if you ever do need them. Most aren't available on Apple's website or any (public) torrent trackers. You have to do something like use Pacifist to dig around .pkgs on the installation disk / image.\nI've split my Applications folder into subdirectories, using a ridiculous Windows drive name-like naming scheme.

Apparently you download it from the Mac App Store, but I don't understand how that would work, because it's not an app.\nCan a developer who has installed it explain the process to me?\n\nA: May as well add my setup:\nI am installing 10.7 on a second partition on my main computer.\nTo start with, I cloned my 10.6 system to the second partition, so I have (in effect) two identical copies of my computer's state. On one of them, I'll install Lion (as soon as everything finishes downloading). I use Dropbox (free) for syncing my important stuff between partitions (and computers). Or at least I will, as soon as it's updated for compatibility (it won't open). That way, I can always fall back to a good, current system if something breaks.\nYes, you do download from the App Store.\n It downloads an installer. It appears in your dock with a progress bar. When the progress bar fills up, the icon bounces. Click the icon, and it opens an installer much like the 10.6 one found on a disc. You choose the disk/partition to install to, and it chugs away for a half hour.\nNote: I'm not technically a developer; I was invited to the customer seed project. I don't think the install is any different; I was told to download from the app store (I got a code to redeem). Correct me if I'm wrong that the processes are the same.\n\n\n[Disclaimer: Yeah, that link to Dropbox will get me extra storage if you sign up. You'll also get the same amount of extra storage yourself. Win-win. If you don't like that idea, here's the standard link: www.dropbox.com.]\n\nA: I did it. (Apple Developer).\nI have a second computer that I use for all beta testing, running OS X 10.6.  I used the app store on that computer to download the Lion Beta Installer.  It downloads and installs just like any other app.  You then run the Lion Beta Installer app and it reboots and installs Lion as if it came off a CD.  After another reboot, you are running Lion, with all your apps and settings working just fine.\nHope this does not defy the NDA.\n", "Q: Where to find 3.5mm (male) to 3.5mm (male) cable that can control iPhone/iPod volume Bonus if it has a mic and can handle iPhone calls\nBasically I have a snowboarding helmet that has speakers built into it and has a 3.5mm (female) connection to the speakers.\n\nA: There are such on ebay.com, I saw one today searching for \"4 conductor 3.5mm [extension] cable\" - I agree, they are rare. (You might have to build it yourself by buying two iPod earphones and then soldering the four cables, but I hope that's not necessary!)\n\nA: I can't vouch for it, but it looks like what you're asking for :-)\nhttp://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-built-microphone-iPhone/dp/B003QNIBBS\n\nA: If you'd also want to skip the cable itself, I would suggest taking a look at the Jabra BT3030 Bluetooth \"Headset\", which you could connect with any male-to-male cable.\n", "Q: Can you upload programs you write to the iPad without involving the Apple store? I understand that you need to pay $99 and get the SDK to write applications for the iPad, but do you really have to upload them to the store to get them to work on the iPad, or is there a way to get them onto your own device for \"testing purposes?\"\nFailing that, I understand that Apple now has some way for corporations to distribute enterprise applications without involving the Apple store.  What if you wanted to write an application that is to be distributed to a handful of people in a corporate environment.  Could this alternate mechanism be used without involving the Apple store and its approval process?\n\nA: Yes, there is Ad Hoc distribution that lets you install your app on 100 iPods or iPads. There is something similar for corporations which allows more than 100 devices.\n\nAd Hoc Distribution\n  Share your application with up to 100 other iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch users with Ad Hoc distribution. Share your application through email, or by posting it to a web site or server.\n\n\nA: Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but Test Flight is a great little web app for installing and updating your \"beta tests\" on-the-fly.\nUpdate: TestFlight has been acquired by Apple and is now tightly integrated into iTunes Connect.

I just bought a new hard drive for my Macbook and want to install a fresh OS X 10.6. I looked through all the CDs that I have and I could only find the Mac OS X Install DVD that came with a new Mac Mini I bought a couple of months ago.\nCan I use that disc to install Mac OS X 10.6 for my Macbook?\nNormally I would think it'd be no problem, but the install disk prominently says \"Mac mini\" on it. I'm wondering if the OS is specially tailored for Mac Mini's and won't have the drivers necessary for Macbooks.\nThe rest of the disc says:\nMac Mini\nMac OS X Install DVD\nMac OS version 10.6.4\nDisc version 1.0\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: The installation disk coming with a computer is for that computer model only, and I would not expect this to work.\nIf your MacBook runs 10.5 you are eligible for the 10.6 upgrade for $29.  I can highly recommend it, if nothing else, for the fixes in Time Machine.\n\nA: If your model of Mac mini came out AFTER your model of MacBook, then it will probably work, although your Mac mini's specific flavor of 10.6.4 was probably never tested/qualified by Apple for that model of MacBook. YMMV. Use at your own risk. \n\nA: Apple would tell you that install disks are linked to the computer you bought it with, but it wouldn't hurt to try.\nAlternate solution: Copy everything over from the old drive with something like Super Duper.\n\nA: There is only one version of Mac OS X (as opposed to Windows which is riddled with countless variations). Even if the ignite disc that you have doesn't work, buying a copy of 10.6 is cheaper than a week's worth of Starbucks: MacSales.com/SnowLeopard - $27.99 + tax & ship.\n", "Q: Using caps lock key instead of right click (contextual menu) I'd like to remap Caps Lock to right click - for the cases where I can focus on objects with cursor keys, or tab. \nFor instance after selecting files in Finder I'd like to hit Caps Lock and get the contextual menu you'd get on right click.\n\nA: The 3rd party tool http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/ seems to be able to do what you need to remap your keys.\nOne possibility is to remap Caps Lock to Control and thus pressing Caps Lock + left-click would open the context menu.\nSure, this doesn't remove the need for a mouse click, so the right-click might be a better solution :)\n\nA: You can use BetterTouchTool for this. Just create a keyboard shortcut which is bound to right-click.\nThere are to caveats, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*The right-click command will be sent to wherever the mouse is, not on whatever is focused via the keyboard.\n\n*To bind the CapsLock key, you may need to use a combination of KeyRemap4MacBook (to rebind CapsLock to some other key), as well as PCKeyboardHack (to improve CapsLock rebinding support).\n\n\nI'm not sure if there is any way to invoke the context menu on the focused element rather than wherever the mouse is. However, if you do find such a way to do this, you can use a combination of KeyRemap4MacBook and PCKeyboardHack to rebind it to CapsLock.\n", "Q: MacBook freezing? While I was working with my (unibody, 10.5) MacBook, suddenly the display was covered by a grey shade and a message - in four languages - appeared, ordering me to restart the computer, and of course nothing else was working.\nWhile I know that I should describe in detail all programs running etc., does anybody have an idea about what kind of problem could possibly have caused this? I don't believe it ever happened in almost three years with the same computer.\n\nA: This is called a Kernel Panic, and it probably wasn't your fault. They usually aren't a huge deal. \nThis Apple doc has information about what happened, and directions about what could have caused it and how to fix it.\nIn says about the problem:\n\nThis message indicates that an error\n  occurred in the core of the operating\n  system, which is referred to as a\n  “kernel panic.”\nA kernel panic can be caused by\n  damaged or incompatible software or,\n  in rare cases, by damaged or\n  incompatible hardware.

Lion has a lot of bugs already \"enjoyable\" and quite possibly a lot more to be found in the following weeks. You'll have to reinstall your OS/Xcode quite often when new releases become available. \nIt's nice to try things (\"new\" AppKit stuff) and investigate if certain things work in Lion or how will they react to new tech like \"Versions\", Full screen, apps being resizable from any corner, etc. All these new things will require new code and current devs will certainly want to add these capabilities. That's what this is all about. \nOther OS X betas in the past were certainly stable (especially after a couple of releases) but I can't recall a \"first\" one being barely usable beyond experimentation. \nLaunchbar is buggy as hell at the moment. \n", "Q: How to set up equal height columns with a title on top?

Applied some padding to it and it's perfect.\n\nA: I don't have access to Pages at the moment (I'm on an old Macbook on a travel) but a quick fix to your problem would be to set up a text box on top that doesn't allow text to be under it and expand it to cover both columns. \nWith that said, I'm sure there's a way to set up the columns to behave like that in a more \"correct\" way, but you'll have to wait until tuesday for me to get back, been offline for almost 30 days and I haven't touched Pages in a while :)\n\nA: page layout- page breaks- continues\n", "Q: How to remove unfinished Boot Camp Partition? When I tried to create a new partition using Boot Camp it suddenly crashed and my computer restarted. Apparently the partition was created because the 50GB I specified during creation are gone from my HDD but the partition never got registered. How can I remove the partition and begin from scratch? \n\nA: One option is to boot from your Mac OS X Install CD and edit the partitions using the Disk Utility (found in the menu). This can be very handy for removing partitions that just won't die.\n", "Q: Remove Storage iOS Apps on Mac Is it possible to remove the Mac copy (iTunes/Mobile Applications) of all synced iOS applications (they are already installed on my iOS device)? They are currently taking up about 6 GB of space on my hard drive. I'm talking about the .IPA files. Thanks!\n\nA: Quit iTunes.  Then you can go into your \"~/Music/iTunes/Mobile\\ Applications/\" directory, and manually delete apps using the Terminal or Finder.  Before the next Sync, in iTunes control-click to hit the \"Reset Warnings\" menu item for your device.  During the next Sync, iTunes may ask if you want to (re)copy purchased files from the device.  Just say no.  iTunes will be confused, but the apps will remain on the device, and not on your HD.\nIt would be better to first make a backup copy of your Mobile Applications directory with Time Machine, or to another HD, before messing with iTunes internal data like this.\n\nA: If you remove the .ipa files (hopefully not from the OS X Finder, but through iTunes), you'll reclaim the storage space, but iTunes won't be able to alert you if there's a new update for that iOS app (which may be important if you get your updates via iTunes on your desktop/laptop Macs).\n\nA: You could try changing the location of your media library's files to an external drive in advanced tab of preferences. Make sure to also uncheck \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\". This will prevent imported music from duplicating itself in that iTunes folder.\n", "Q: Why did the Sparrow dock icon stop bouncing on launch? The Sparrow mail app icon had been bouncing fine on launching the app till a few days ago but has stopped doing so recently. Any reasons why it might be so? I miss the bouncing dock icon.\n\nA: This is mentioned in the release notes for 1.0.1:\n\nBe aware that implementing the ‘Menu bar only’ mode breaks the usual bouncing behavior of the dock icon. We know no AppStore compliant workaround for the dock icon to behave properly when the ‘Menu bar only’ is implemented.\n\n\nA: Have you set the \"Show Icon In\" option on the General tab of Preferences to \"Only in Menu Bar\"? If you have then the dock icon won't bounce anymore and when you have Sparrow open you probably won't see the little hightlight at the bottom that normally indicates when an application is open.\nActually I just set that option back to \"Dock and Menu Bar\" and my Sparrow dock icon doesn't bounce either.\nThis might be a bug in the 1.0.1 release they issued fairly recently.\n", "Q: Can I manually connect my Facebook contacts to my AddressBook contacts? I have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Facebook friends\n\n*iPhoto faces\n\n*Address Book contacts\n\n\nFaces and contacts are already linked. Some friends are also linked to the contacts. There is a problem with the friends that don't use their full name in their Facebook profile. They just don't.\nIs there a way to link them manually, so when I tag someone in iPhoto with his/her full name it will appear in Facebook (given the photo is shared from iPhoto) as tagged with the correct friend?\nPS: I have the iPhone Facebook app, if that helps (I think it has some kind of sync function).\n\nA: Your question is really confusing but let me try to answer it the best I can.\nLet me start by mentioning that this is why I hate Facebook contact syncing. People (like myself) don't use their real info and when you sync data you end up with a mess in your address book. I personally would suggest that you don't do it that way. My contacts that I set up manually are waaaay more accurate than merging info from Facebook into my address book. It takes more work, but it's worth it.\nTo tag someone in Facebook you have to connect it to their Facebook account and use their Facebook name. You can tag photos with your own name but it won't link up to the person's FB account.\nAlso are you using the newest version of iPhoto? And are these photos that you are tagging being uploaded and shared from the iPhoto app itself? You can tag people in iPhoto and then upload the photo album from iPhoto and it will bring over all of the data for the people you tagged to FB. But like I said, you have to tag them using their FB name and not their real name for it to be able to link to their FB account.\nAs far as I know, there is no way to accomplish what you are trying to do at this point in time.\n\nA: I have noticed that you can add the Facebook profile manually.  See details on this web page.  http://www.macworld.com/article/1161225/lion_address_book.html.  Basically, when editing the card, select Card.Add Field.Profile to add Profile to your card.  Change this to Facebook and then use the Facebook unique identifier (found at the end of the profile URL on Facebook).  However, it does not seem to be updating my image yet.\n", "Q: iTerm2.app stopped working Since a couple of hours, when I try to run iTerm2.app, it opens a window, says \n## exec failed ##\nlogin No such file or directory\n\nand closes rather fast. Running Terminal.app works and if I run /Applications/iTerm2.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm from it it works just fine. Any ideas what's going on or how to fix it?\n\nA: Sounds like your Default terminal has it's initial working directory set to some directory that no longer exists.\nTry trashing your iTerm2 settings and starting from scratch. To delete your bookmarks and all other settings move the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist to the Trash.\n\nA: The problem was .MacOSX/environment.plist. I didn't expected it to be the problem because I changed several days ago, but it seems it doesn't get re-loaded until you reboot.\nI'm not 100% sure, but I think the problem was that I was trying to use the PATH variable to define it, I had this:\nPATH => $PATH:/another/one\n\nI've replaced that with a complete path and no $PATH variable, rebooted and now it's working.\n", "Q: Copy an application over to another phone? I have a very old demo application on my iPhone. It was on the app store a long time ago (1 year) the guy who developed it works with me. He's since taken the app off iTunes, however our boss wants to demo it tomorrow. Anyone know how I can go about getting the application onto his phone bearing in mind the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*We can't deploy from the developer's computer\n\n*It's not on iTunes\n\n\nA: You can't just copy it, because it won't match the profiles. \nYour only hope is use a provisioning profile and set your boss' phone as a development device\nHere's how.\n\nA: I did a blogpost which details how you can copy an application from one iPhone to another. Not sure if it's an exact fit with the constraints you have placed but still worth a try. Here's the link- http://www.gauravgupta.in/blog/2009/08/share-iphone-apps-with-multiple-iphones/\n", "Q: Common Lisp on Mac OS X? Is there a comparison between the different versions of Common Lisp for Mac OS X? Is there a clear frontrunner?\n\nA: For comparisons, see: http://common-lisp.net/~dlw/LispSurvey.html\nAgreed with the others: yes, use SBCL or CCL.  \nCCL makes it easier to invoke ObjC libraries, such as for writing native Mac Apps.  That becomes the tie-breaker for some.  (Personally, I've enjoyed using both but tend to stay current on SBCL as my main compiler for server software.)\nFor completeness: \nCCL is Clozure CL (not to be confused with one spelled using \"j\" in middle, which is another dialect than Common Lisp).  SBCL compiles to faster code, and CCL has shorter compile times.  Both are solid compilers.\nFor targeting iOS/iPhone/iPad, there's been some success with ECL.  See: http://funcall.posterous.com/tag/iphone  But I wouldn't consider this a front-runner and haven't actually used it myself yet beyond samples posted on that blog.\nAlthough MacOSX thread support is considered experimental with SBCL and self tests will fail if you compile from sources (which is required to enable threads), threads work well enough for most cases.  I've deployed heavily threaded production code by developing on MacOSX then releasing to servers running FreeBSD (which also has similar issues with threads) and Debian/Ubuntu Linux (very stable).  This has served me well for the past 5-6 years, including at a few start-ups.\nQuickLisp (for obtaining libraries) is very stable on SBCL/MacOSX.  Haven't tried it on CCL but should be rock solid there too!\n\nA: A friend of mine who is an avid Lisper recommends SBCL. It's easy to install/maintain with Homebrew (my preference) or MacPorts.\n\nA: Not sure about objective comparison sites but I've used clozure in the past a sort of  off spring of digitool's mcl (dead by now, but code is open sourced I think).\nI think there a are other possibilities as well, emacs being the first to come in mind but that is not common lisp while giving it a second thought.\n", "Q: iPod Touch 4G case recommendations What is the best iPod Touch G4 case that clips on a belt and covers the screen?\nThe main annoyance I have with my current case is that I can't always reach the edges of the screen.\n\nA: I've been using this case since the day I got mine back in June of 2011.\n\nIts very robust, it completely covers the screen, and I have never had problems tapping the edge.\nOne thing you do need to be aware of though is the clip. In the picture its shown as being on the back, however I've found that to be somewhat unreliable. If you switch it around to the front (so the clip is covering the screen), its much better.\nOne of the (in my opinion nice) side benefits of using this case is it adds enough mass to it that you don't have to worry about the iPod just slipping out of your hand - for the week I used mine without a case, I found that it was almost too light and thin, and I kept fearing that the iPod would just fly out of my hand. Its a full body case (as you can see), so while you can't drop it into water (or a blender) and have it be fine, you can drop it a few times and it'll still be OK (handy for those first few times the belt clip fails until you learn the best way to use it! ;)\n", "Q: How can one copy photos off an iPad onto a Windows computer (prior to syncing)? My father wants to sync a bunch of photos from his Windows PC to his iPad for a presentation.  But he's never synced photos before.  And he's downloaded a number of photos from his camera directly to his iPad.  I fear his iPad contains the only copy of some of his photos, and he doesn't want to loose them.  When my father turns on photo syncing in iTunes, he gets a warning that photos on the iPad not previously synced will be lost.\nIf my father was using a Mac, I would tell him to open iPhoto and download the photos from the iPad before syncing.  How can he do the equivalent with Windows (or perhaps with an app)?\n\nA: http://blog.laptopmag.com/how-to-quickly-transfer-images-from-an-ipad-to-a-pc\nA PC, like a Mac, will see the iPad as a camera. Instead of using an application to load the photos, you can just browse to them in Windows Explorer and copy them to a local folder.\n", "Q: Conditional SUM() based on text of a cell using iWork I have some basic data\nName | Amount\nJake | 10\nJake | 12\nJake | 13\nBen  | 1\nBen  | 14\nAli  | 9\nAli  | 4\n\nI want to total up the amount for each person so I end up with something like\nJake | 35\nBen  | 15\nAli  | 13\n\nRather than specifying which cells are Jake's, Ben's and Ali's I want to do this using a function.

Where can I find a list of most purchased iPhone / iPad apps WITH the number of buyers?\n\nA: Nowhere, unfortunately, because the information isn't reported anywhere. Individual publishers sometimes announce their sales and/or number of purchases, but it's uncommon and there's no reporting at all from the majority of the most successful publishers.\n\nA: There is no official list (available publicly).\nCheck the blogs of the various developers of popular apps.  A few developers release this very private financial information.\nThe typical (median popularity ranking) or random paid app usually sells around 0 units per day.  \nAccording to reports from some analytics aggregators, an app has to get somewhere in the top 10% to 20% in popularity rankings to average $10 or more in sales per day.  The apps in the top 2% make most of the money.\n\nA: There aren't a lot of details around on the web. Camera+ seem to have some fairly detailed sales data on their blog. Have a look here and here. \nAs the other answers note, it would only be individual developers releasing data rather than Apple.

I am trying to work with some CD and hard drive images that I will run inside of QEMU. On Linux, I mount the images using the losetup command, but I notice Mac does not have this.\nIs there something similar I could use instead?\n\nA: Mac OS X has the Disk Images Framework for live mounting disk images. Although it primarily works with its own native formats such as .dmg, I believe it can also work with .iso's and other formats. You can use Disk Utility or the hdiutil command to mount disk images. \n\nA: You can use hdiutil for that. Basically, it does the same as losetup on Linux.\nIf you are planning to work with images with non-standard layouts or filesystems (for example, live CDs), make sure to pass -nomount to hdiutil attach, as otherwise it will complain that it couldn’t mount it (it tries to mount everything by default).\nAfter the image is attached, it will appear in diskutil list as an ordinary disk. You can work with it just like with a physical disc.\n\nHere is an example of mounting a live CD:\n$ hdiutil attach -nomount path/to/file.iso\n/dev/disk2              FDisk_partition_scheme\n/dev/disk2s2            0xEF\n\nIt prints the name of the new disk.

You can’t mount it using diskutil, you have to use a special tool:\n$ mount_cd9660 /dev/disk2 ~/tmp/mnt\n\nWhen you are done, unmount and detach:\n$ umount /dev/disk2\n$ hdiutil detach disk2\n\"disk2\" unmounted.\n\"disk2\" ejected.\n\n", "Q: What part do I need for my broken iPhone 3G?

Then it will increment the integer (without the leading zeros) and write it back into the file.\nThe leading zeros part works, but for the life of me I can not figure out how to store the value of the 'counter' variable in a file so that, later, when I call the script again, it will pick up where it left off.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nHere is the error message I get:\n    error \"Can’t make \\\"z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter\\\"  \n    into type file.\" number -1700 from\n    \"z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter\" to file\n\nAnd here is the code:\n    set theFile to \"z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter\"\n        open for access theFile\n        set fileContents to read theFile\n        close access theFile\n\n        set counter to fileContents as integer\n\n\n        on add_leading_zeros(counter, max_leading_zeros)\n        set the threshold_number to (10 ^ max_leading_zeros) as integer\n        if counter is less than the threshold_number then\n            set the leading_zeros to \"\"\n            set the digit_count to the length of ((counter div 1) as string)\n            set the character_count to (max_leading_zeros + 1) - digit_count\n            repeat character_count times\n                set the leading_zeros to (the leading_zeros & \"0\") as string\n            end repeat\n            return (leading_zeros & (counter as text)) as string\n        else\n            return counter as text\n        end if\n    end add_leading_zeros\n\n    add_leading_zeros(counter, 2)\n\n\n    open for access newFile with write permission\n    set eof of newFile to 0\n    write counter + 1 to newFile\n    close access newFile\n\n\nA: Add a .txt extension to the file you're saving to. If counter is the folder, do this:\nset theFile to \"z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter:save.txt\"\n\nAssuming that you have a valid path, this should fix the problem. Otherwise, you're trying to save to a folder.\n\nA: The result of open for access is a \"file reference number\". You must use this number with the read, write, and close access commands. For example,\nset handle to open for access theFile\nset fileContents to read handle\nclose access handle\n\nAlso, the script ignores the result of add_leading_zeros(counter, 2). You can put the result back in counter with\nset counter to add_leading_zeros(counter, 2)\n\nbut if you do counter + 1 after that, AppleScript coerces counter from text to integer, and you lose the leading zeros. You want to add 1 before you put the leading zeros, like\nset counter to add_leading_zeros(counter + 1, 2)\n\n", "Q: How to clone CD or DVD from the CLI so it can be accessed in VirtulaBox Windows VM How can I clone a CD or DVD to an ISO or DMG, using just the CLI, so that I can attach it to a VirtualBox VM.\nI often clone CDs or DVDs using the following commands:\ndiskname=`df -kh /Volumes/* | grep -o Volumes.* | cut -d\"/\" -f2`\ndiskname=`echo $diskname | sed s/\\ //g` # remove spaces\ndevice=`df -kh /Volumes/* | grep Volumes | cut -d\" \" -f1`\n\nsudo umount $device\ndd if=$device of=~/Desktop/$diskname.iso bs=2048\nhdiutil eject $device\n\nThe result is a .ISO on my desktop that is, as far as I can tell, a bit clone of the CD or DVD.\nHowever, when I boot a VirtualBox Windows XP VM and attach the ISO, Windows says it cannot read it.\n\nA: You can use hdiutil to create the disk image, then convert to a hybrid format:\nhdiutil create -srcdevice $device $diskname\nhdiutil makehybrid -o $diskname.iso -joliet -iso $diskname.dmg\n\nNOTE: this method does not require unmounting the device first.\n", "Q: How can i have makefile/shell script call /Applications/application.app? OS Mac OS X 10.6.6\nemacs 23.2.1\nI'm currently trying to install magit on carbon emacs using their proposed make solution. I'm an almost complete makefile newby so I might be on the complete wrong path altogether.\nMakefile displays:\n%.elc: %.el\n$(BATCH) --eval '(byte-compile-file \"$<\")'\n\nwhich gets expanded to:\nemacs -batch -q -no-site-file -eval \"(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name \\\".\\\") load-path))\" --eval '(byte-compile-file \"magit.el\")'\n\nWhat I do understand. However it comes back with:\nCannot open load file: subst-ksc\n\nWhat after a bit of googling reveals some missing libraries. I also realized that the emacs referenced in the expanded command is pointing to /usr/bin/emacs which is one big file, I don't see the normal lisp / site-lisp / etc directories. I also know that my prefered emacs is carbon emacs located in /Application/Emacs.app which just opens when clicking on it, or alternatively, I can open it in with the terminal:\nopen /Application/MyApp.app\n\nFinally the title question: How can I make Makefile using the Emacs.app on the applications directory? I hope someone here knows the answer, or can point me to alternatives.\nregards,\nJeroen.\n\nA: To use the Emacs.app from shell you need the unix executable embedded inside it. It is at Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs (I don't have this version of emacs so the capitalisation might differ)\nAn alternative is to use open to start any app from the workspace using open.\ne.g. \nopen -a Emacs.app --args <all those passed to emacs>\n\n\nA: I'm answering an older question in case anyone else happens across it via Google like I did.\nAs Mark pointed out, to byte-compile a file using the Emacs.app executable you need to replace emacs or /usr/bin/emacs in the Makefile with /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs. I believe that in general byte-compiled files are not compatible across different versions of Emacs, so when installing a package for use with Emacs.app you should byte-compile it using this executable, not with the default Apple-installed /usr/bin/emacs (which is a version 22 emacs on my 10.6 system).\nIf you do need to run the /usr/bin/emacs for some other reason, take care that EMACSLOADPATH doesn't contain files belonging to a newer Emacs. This is one potential cause of error messages such as\nCannot open load file: subst-ksc\nInvoking emacs from the shell as\nEMACSLOADPATH=/usr/share/emacs/22.1/leim:/usr/share/emacs/22.1/lisp:/usr/share/emacs/22.1/site-lisp emacs\nshould do the trick.\nHope this helps someone else!\n", "Q: Slow loading/transparent menu bar during startup Sometimes when I startup my Mac, I notice that the menu bar doesn't load fully.

It doesn't even have the Apple logo on the top left side.\nHere's a picture of what it looks like:\n\nAny idea what causes this or how to fix it?\n\nA: This happens to me too sometimes. A guaranteed solution: Restart the menu bar. Here's how:\nOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities).

I followed the procedure, and I saved of my iPhone with iTunes, then restored it, then restored the backup with iTunes (last version). I didn't do anything special but followed the path given by iTunes on a reset / restore procedure.\nAfter the restore procedure, some apps that I have been using for months did not get installed. According to iTunes the two reasons are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Missing signature, \n\n*or Resources modified. \n\n\nThis also happens with newly downloaded applications after the reset.\nMy iPhone is not (and wasn't) jailbroken, and I don't understand what happened.\nHow may I solve this problem, without loosing datas, apps, music or photo libraries, or need to reinstall everything from scratch app per app ?\nSome additional notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any app that I download now that doesn't want to install from iTunes, can be correctly installed when downloaded directly on the iPhone. And no sync problems with iTunes.\n\n*Even updating a working and installed app can cause the problem.\n\n*New error with an app download from iTunes : \"Unknown error 0xE800000B\"\n\n*No music (nor anything else) is displayed in the iPod app, but iTunes shows the music, podcatsts, ... as present on the iPhone.\n\n\nWith BitDefender fully deactivated (as it cannot be quit), and ZoneAlarm shut down, it does not change anything.

How would I go about transferring iTunes credit between accounts? \nThe question pretty well speaks for itself. I have two accounts, one for my iPod, one for my iPhone, I have passwords to both accounts, I can handle talking to Apple Support if that's what needs be, but I was curious if I can transfer the funds without going through customer service. Should I just \"gift\" myself purchases?\n\nA: This totally will not work. iTunes explicitly says gift certificate balances can not be used to purchase other gift certificates. I will call apple tomorrow to find another work around.\n\nA: You can not transfer allowance you have already redeemed onto a separate account - I am having just this problem at the moment and I am seriously pissed off with the difficulty and the lack of help ITunes give\n\nA: Gifting content from one account to the other would be the simplest way to accomplish what you are looking for (albeit, this means you have to do the gifting from the device with the funds).\n\nA: IIRC, you can use your account balance to send another user a (virtual) gift card.\n\nA: Have you tried making an allowance to the desired account? That works between $10 and $50 so you should be able to drain any amount more than $10 this way over time by making sure the last month balance is at least $10. It doesn't involve purchasing a new gift card which is explicitly not allowed and may just work.\nYou can gift apps for the last $10 if the balance is initially less than $10 or the math doesn't work out nicely.\nYou might want to remove your credit card temporarily from the sending account in case it charges the allowance instead of spending down a store credit.\n\nA: By the way, it's totally possible to call and get a credit issued as a check, if the balance was put there by a credit card or the like. This was how I ended up with such a balance, and I did not know you could do this. :D\n\nA: In lieu of transferring an iTunes balance to another account, I have used dollars on my iPad to Purchase an app on my grandson's iPod, by using my iPad apple ID on his iPod.  The problem with that is that to update the app, he has to have your iPad apple ID.  Another way is to purchase apps on the iPad, back up to my PC, then connect his iPod to my PC and Install the app on the iPod.  You still have the same problem if he wants to update the app on his iPod, he has to have my iPad apple ID and password.\n", "Q: Auto Pairing of iPhone with Toyota Prius Every time I want to connect an iPhone to the Toyota Prius, I have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Prius, go to the audio screen, then select the bluetooth tab.\n\n*Press the connect button.\n\n*On the iPhone, go to Settings > General > Bluetooth and tap the connection to the car.\n\n*Wait until the two pair, then exit their respective screens.\n\n\nIsn't there a way to have the two pair up automatically as they detect one another?\n\nA: (Our Toyota RAV4 is not at home right now, otherwise I would go look in the manual to see what I did).\nI know for our Toyota RAV4, that I was able to automatically pair my wife's iPhone with the car so that each time the car is turned on (and the iPhone is in range of the car), the bluetooth system takes over and lets us answer the phone through the car. \nMy suggestion is to look in your owner's manual and look up how to affect a default pairing. When my RAV4 comes home in a few hours, I can look up the steps we used.\n\nA: Yes, you can just keep your iPhone in your pocket (or wherever you like) BUT MAKE SURE BLUETOOTH IS ON. Then inside the car, just touch the monitor and select bluetooth. You will find your iPhone already registered there (you can register up to 10 Phones in the Toyota Prius).\nSo once you click bluetooth, choose your iPhone name, and it will automatically pair.\nUnfortunately, the car doesn't provide any other easiest option than this.\n\nA: I paired my iPhone 6+ without problems. I upgraded to a 7+ and I too could not get it to work via Bluetooth.\nI learned, besides pairing my iPhone which did work, you also have to push the Setup button and configure the AUDIO to work with Bluetooth.\nOnce I did that it worked like a charm after I push the AUX button. \n", "Q: How can I make Apple menu shortcut keys work more like Windows? I recently converted from Windows to Mac, but one thing that I really liked on Windows was how easy it was to traverse the menu bar and the associated submenus with the keys.  Effectively, I would push the magic menu button and then type letters corresponding to menu options.  With Mac the analog is an awkward button combination followed by repetitively hitting up, down, left, and right.  \nSo, is there any way to make my Mac behave like a Windows computer in this respect?\n\nA: It works pretty much as you describe Windows.\nIf you want a better key combo to access the menu bar, you can customize it under System Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Keyboard & Text Input > Move focus to the menu bar. \nThen type to select which menu you want, hit enter, then type to select the menu item.\nNote that most menu items have keyboard shortcuts. These are written next to the menu item, often a single character preceded by the CMD key.\n\nA: The fastest way to access the menu items is just by hitting  Command   Shift   ? , and typing the menu item you want in the search box that appears\n", "Q: Why can't I resize my existing partition? I just finished downloading my copy of Lion and wanted to install it on a new second partition. I freed up just over 50 GBs from my hard drive and am now stuck trying to shrink my existing partition. I'm using the Disk Utility, but am continually getting:\n\nPartition failed\nPartition failed with the error:\nThe partition cannot be resized. Try\n  reducing the amount of change in the\n  size of the partition.\n\nI've tried just resizing by 1 gigabyte and it still fails. Any free tools to fix this? Thanks.\n\nA: You've probably got fragmentation of your free space. For some reason, Disk Utility can't figure this out on its own; it just fails.\nI found a stunningly simple way to resolve this: create a new disk image with Disk Utility that's a little bit smaller than the remaining space on your drive.\nIt took several minutes on my SSD, presumably while OS X moved things around. I imagine it would take significantly longer on a hard drive.\nWhen it's done, delete the disk image you just created. You should now be able to resize your partition!\n\nA: The GUI for Disk Utility has always had problems with resizing volumes.\nYou could try diskutil from the command line, if you trust your skills enough.\nI'd start the Terminal and write diskutil list to see all devices connected.\nTo resize a volume from the list you'd write something like this (Let's assume that disk2s2 is 100GB):\ndiskutil resizeVolume disk2s2 50g HFS+ Lion 0b \nThis should create a secod partition with 50gb size, HFS+ format(mac format) and the name Lion\n\nA: When I ran into this problem, I used iDefrag to defragment the volume, and that let me shrink it.  Unfortunately it's not free.\nIt has since occurred to me that it might work better to dismount the partition before shrinking.  If you want to try this, you'll need to boot from something else, like your O S X install DVD.\n\nA: I don't mean to open up an age old thread, but simply running fsck -fy from single user mode fixed it for me.\nFrom the man page:\n-f     Force fsck to check `clean' filesystems when preening.\n-y     Assume a yes response to all questions asked by fsck; this should\n       be used with great caution as this is a free license to continue\n       after essentially unlimited trouble has been encountered.\n\n\nA: This is what worked for me, and avoided backing up and restoring the volume.\nWhile you are resizing your partition, do tail -f /var/log/kernel.log or run the Console application and select kernel.log.\nThis will tell you why the resize is failing.\nUnfortunately, it will only give you the inode number for the file or directory that is preventing the resize.\nTo find the file name corresponding to this inode, you can use the find command from the terminal:\n$ cd /Volumes/<volume you are trying to resize>\n$ find -x . -inum <the inode number from kernel.log>\n\nOnce you find the file, copy it to a different volume, if you want to save it, and then delete it on the volume you are resizing.\nThen rerun the resize operation and it should succeed.

I know FAT32 is writeable by both systems but am I correct to remember that it has limits to partition size (32GB if formatted from Windows or 2TB) and file size (4GB)? If that's the case then it's not good for me as I use it to transfer files over 5GB.\n\nA: According to this answer, you can use exFAT if your version of Mac OS X and Windows are new enough. That would be at least Mac OS X 10.6.5 and Windows Vista SP1. \n", "Q: Port forwarding on iPhone? I'm using iPhone as a modem.\nIs there a way to port forward to my computer because I'm using it as a development server.\n\nA: Short answer\nUntil now (iOS 9.1) there has been no way to configure port forwarding in Personal Hotspot\nLong Answer\nActivating Personal Hotspot on an iOS device enables it's built-in NAT router. Other devices that connect to this iPhone (using USB, WiFi or Bluetooth) get an IP in the 172.16.0.0/12 subdomain.\nThere are no NAT settings in iOS, nor does it provide UPnP or NAT-PMP for remote NAT configuration.\nWhy?\nNobody knows Apple's reasons.\nWild guess: Knowing that availability of the Personal Hotspot feature on an iOS device depends on it's carrier, Apple may have disabled further features as way to play nice with the carriers.\nPossible Workarounds\n\n*\n\n*On the device that needs to accept incoming connections: connect to a VPN that provides a public IP and incoming connections\n\n*If you have access to the remote device you could create a tunnel (e.g. with ssh)\n\n*If the remote device is connected to the same iCloud account, enabling Back to my Mac will put you on the same private IPv6 network\n\n*Using a 4G modem instead of your iPhone will give you a direct internet connection accepting incoming connections\n\nEdit: BUT...\nEven you could bypass NAT on your device, your cellular IPv4 internet connection is very probably also behind a carrier-grade NAT.\n\nA: There is no way to do port forwarding on an iPhone when using it as a Wi-Fi hotspot.  This is by design.  (IMO) the iPhone hotspot feature was to allow users to access the Internet via their phone's data plan so the user could check email, surf the web, chat, etc.   It wasn't designed to serve as a router with more advanced features.\nThere are no ports open on either \"side\" of the iPhone hotspot in which to interface for management.  I did a portscan on both the public side and the private side (from a Mac and a PC) to see if I could access a management page - it's locked down and doesn't respond (though it does respond to a ping).\nHowever, I just tested and verified that my dedicated hotspot - AT&T Unite Explore does support port forwarding (page 60 of User Manual).  I was able to forward port 22 to my laptop and successfully connected via SSH to it.  \nOne last thing - while I was able to do this successfully on AT&T, your provider may not allow you to open ports on your device - check with them first.\n", "Q: Why are my browsers only downloading some files but not others? My 12 month-old MacBook Pro just suddenly seems to not want to download certain files. \nThis sounds like a silly noob PEBKAC but it's not! For the past few weeks, most files that I click on in my browser which are not viewable in the browser (DMG, ZIP, etc) do not prompt me to save them. Instead of the Open with/Save File dialog appearing I just see a blank page and get the spinning wheel in that browser's tab. The status bar at the bottom reports \"Transferring data from \" but the download never completes, no matter how long I wait.\nI've done some initial troubleshooting. Here's what I've ascertained:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can use my web browser to view HTML pages, PNG images, JPG images, Flash sites, and even sites that load Java applets.\n\n*The issue is not specific to a file type (extension). I can download some ZIP files, but not others (see below).\n\n*The issue is not due to any ISP level filtering. My wife's computer, on the same network (older version of OS X) does not have this problem.\n\n*The issue is not related to the size of the file. See examples below.\n\n*From doing some digging on the mozillazine knowledgebase, I thought perhaps that my problem was a corrupt localstore.rdf file. I deleted this, both manually and using the \"Safe mode\" option, but it didn't seem to make any difference.\n\n*I've also tried resetting options related to browser.download in about:config, but this hasn't made any difference either.\n\n*It was at this stage that I tried other browsers, and came to the conclusion that it was something at the OS level. Yes, this problem occurs in ALL browsers that I have installed (Firefox 3.6, Opera, Safari and Chrome).\n\n*The issue happens regardless whether I'm connected to my home wi-fi network or a different wi-fi network (e.g. at work).\n\n*I currently have my firewall disabled in System Preferences.\n\n*(edit) After posting this question, I installed a download manager called Folx. Entering the URL of a file directly into this app seems to download any file just fine. However I'm stunned why the default browsers are behaving like this, and would prefer the lightweight browser default to a heavy, feature-rich third party download manager.\n\n\nHere's an example of a file that I can download just fine.

Also apologies for removing hyperlinks that were added for me by a mod — I couldn't update the post without removing them :(\n\nA: Have you tried to ⌥-click a link to a download?\nThis usually guaranteed to download the file.\n\nA: The two thoughts that come to mind for me are:\nProxy settings\nMaybe you're set up to use a proxy server for some reason?  Most browsers automatically use the OS proxy settings.\nGo to System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced (make sure Airport is selected) -> Proxies\nCustom DNS Provider\nAre you using OpenDNS, Google DNS, or something other than your ISPs default DNS server?  If so, you might want to try switching back temporarily to see if that fixes the problem.\nGo to System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced (make sure Airport is selected) -> DNS\n\nA: Are these downloads from a particular site (or sites)? \nThis could very possibly be a misconfiguration on the web server you're downloading the files from. If it's sending an incorrect or unrecognized MIME type, your browser wouldn't know how to handle the file. I've seen cases where the browser happily downloads files from one site and throws up completely on the same kind of file from a different type.\nWhen that happens, I usually find that Right-click > Save as gets the job done.\n\nA: Are you running low on hard disk space? Does the download fail immediately or does it get all the way to the end and then fail? Even if you don't see a Save/Open dialog and you click on a link, you can use the \"Show Downloads\" window of whichever browser you are in to see what it is currently downloading and the progress that's been made.\nI was just wondering if you were really low on space (a few gb or less of free space), then some applications (and the OS) tend to act funny. The OS uses quite a lot of disk space for swap files. Perhaps if you are in this low-space zone, the browsers are trying to download the file for you but then bailing at the end because of a (possibly) erroneous low-space message from the OS.\nNote: This is pretty much a hail-mary pass with little expectation that this will be the solution, but I wanted to put it out there in case it helped you.\nOne other thing to try is to create a brand new user on your Macbook and then log into that user and try to download some of these same files and see if it behaves correctly. If so, then you definitely have a configuration issue and I would focus on trying to either \"clean\" or \"reset\" your account to a more pristine state (one change a time) so you can isolate what the problem might be. At the very least, try running Disk Utility to fix any invalid permissions or disk errors that you might have.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Have you tried downloading from another user account on the same Mac?  That'd at least isolate it to a user vs system issue.  If it's only a problem in your user account, try pulling out ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist, then log out and back in and see if it changes (I'm guessing that it could possibly be a messed up handler for some protocol/mime type/whatever, and those are Launch Services' responsibility).\n\nA: This is a known issue with OS X, but luckily there is a easy fix.

Every new window should now use this new setup as a default.\n\nA: Before you resize the open window to your desired size, close all other Finder windows. If another Finder window is open, then your adjustments won't stick. Then close the adjusted window and try opening a window by switching using the File > New Finder Window command or by clicking on the Dock > Finder icon.\nNote that it doesn't matter for me whether I select an item within the window before adjusting it. I'm running 10.6.6.\nAnd if you're opening windows from a CD/DVD, then all bets are off.\nFinally, if I resize the window and then rm .DS_Store, the new window still uses its most recent size/location.\n\nA: OK, I'm not a 100 % sure about that one, but based on my experience, Finder save the window size/look for each folder. Probably in the ._DS_Store file.\nSo, it seems Finder has trouble accessing this file, or that the file is corrupt.\nTry to delete the ._DS_Store file in your home folder (or whatever folder is opening when you \"Open the Finder\") and reopen the window.\n\nA: First off, each directory has a ._DS_Store file. Each one has a \"memory\" of how that folder was last displayed. Apple does have a tendency to open it at a \"default\" size. Any reason the \"green\" button isn't working?\n", "Q: What are the empty home and net drives? I have two drives on my Mac which are always empty (I've enabled show hidden files in the Finder):\n\nWhat are these drives for?\n\nA: Not sure why you're always seeing them -- I don't, even with hidden files enabled -- but they're the root directories commonly used by the automounter when you connect your Mac to an NFS network (which generally means a Unix/Linux network). Users' home directories are usually mounted under /home, and other shared filesystems under /net.\n", "Q: iTunes library sync between two computers I have two computers (iMac and a Macbook Air). Whenever I try to sync my iPhone to the Air it will remove all my data. \nIs there any possibility to have a common sync mechanism in between my two computers (or especially iTunes libraries) so that I can sync my iPhone without any problem. \n\nA: The only way to do this, according to Apple, is to set the devices to manually manage content. If you have auto-syncing enabled, it can only be connected to one computer.\n\nYou can manage your iPhone, iPad, or iPod with multiple computers1,2 as long as you have set the device to \"Manually manage music.\"\n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1202\n\nA: I use ChronoSync from http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html.  Their tip for syncing iTunes is at  http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_tips25.html.\n\nA: When I manually synchronized my entire user profile from my MacBook Pro to my MacBook air, the next Sync on the new MacBook Air behaved normally, and didn't remove anything.\nYou might be able to get by by just copying your ~/Library/MobileDevice , ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync , and your ~/Music/iTunes directories to your user account on your new Mac, but you'd have to do some experimentation to find the required set of directories to keep in sync between the 2 Macs.\n\nA: Here is a posting about how to sync your iTunes on 2 machines. http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040927151426616 \nI imagine this would also solve your iPhone sync problems.\n\nA: I don't do this with iTunes, but I have a method for syncing apps between machines that works very well.\nFirst, install Dropbox or an equivalent file-syncing solution.\nThen, create a directory for the configuration and library files of the application (I use ~/Dropbox/config/appname/). Move the relevant config directories in there. Usually, this would be ~/Library/Application Support/Appname/ and possibly some .plist files in ~/Library/Preferences/. Then you also need to move the actual library into dropbox.\nThen, create symbolic links to those new locations from the places where the application expects them. Since iTunes can be configured to place its library (the actual music files) in any folder, you don't need to accomplish this by means of a symlink. The command for creating symlinks are as follows and must be executed in a terminal:\nln -s newlocation expectedlocation\nE.g.:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Config/iTunes ~/Library/Application\\ Support/iTunes\nIf you do this on both machines (on the second - delete all the config files, you should have copied the library you wish to replicate into dropbox) and you don't open the software at the same time on both machines, you should be synced.\n", "Q: Which 13\" MacBook Pro 2011 is right for me? I'm completely new to Mac (OS X) and I want to buy a 13\" Macbook Pro 2011. I'm not sure if the \"2,7 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7\" is worth the +300€.\nI want to order one of the two with a 128GB SSD for fast boots. I'm a developer (mainly web) so I need the book for programming and for the university later this year. I'm not going to install Windows or Linux on the machine. I need Mac OS X.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any advantage of a SSD in the Mac as long I don't plan gaming? Or do they boot up fast from some kind of sleep mode? I need a Notebook which starts really quick and does not loose battery when off (sleep mode etc.).\n\n*Is the i7 much better than the i5? I mean the only difference between the two books is only CPU and HDD.\n\n*Is 13\" enough? I can't visit an Apple store since there aren't any in my region. My current notebook is a 15\" one running Ubuntu and I think it shouldn't be much smaller. But the 15\" Macbooks are too expensive for me and a 13\" might be more portable. I'll connect the book to a larger screen @ home anyway.\n\n*Thanks.\n\n\nA: I've ordered the cheapest 13\" as my first mac.\nI already have a 80 GB SSD which I will put in it immediately when it arrives. An SSD is beneficial to about everything you can do on your mac because the hard disk is usually the performance bottleneck.\nDon't worry about the screen size and resolution if you'll hook it up to an external monitor anyway. I've played around with a 13\" a lot this week and the screen size and resolution are fine for normal pc usage.\nI would not pay extra for the upgraded CPU.\nRemember that the cheapest 13\" has about the same cpu speed as the previous generation's 17\" flagship! (see benchmarks posted below)\nSo either way I would go with the cheapest version.\nIf you are unable/unwilling to open up your mac yourself I would take the SSD option. You can always get a nice little external HD with 1TB disk space for not much money, if you run out of SSD space. \nHere are CPU benchmarks:\n\n\nA: I can only really answer question #3:\nAs a developer/photographer I think 13\" is a good size for a laptop, as long as you are connecting it to an external monitor back at base. The 13\" laptops are a lot more portable than the 15\" ones, ideal for taking to uni!\n", "Q: Aperture vs Photoshop I already have a lot of experience in Photoshop because I normally use it to edit my photos, but I've heard that Aperture is far better (or easier to use) than Photoshop. I started using the trial version but it's not that good. It's just like Lightroom. Is there any difference if i buy the full version? Also, does Aperture support plugins?\n\nA: I'm currently making the transition from Lightroom over to Aperture. You are right in that Aperture is more like Lightroom than Photoshop. Its primary use is as a digital library for managing your photos, and videos. Much like iPhoto.\nLightroom and Aperture both have good editing functionality and both have the ability to use plugins for expanding the editing functions.\nBoth applications also allow non-destructive editing. Meaning you can always go back to the original image no matter what changes you do to the image within the application.\nAperture, like Lightroom, is designed with the photographer in mind. Digital assest management, photo editing, and exporting abilities for printing etc...\nIt's best to use either (or both) of these alongside Photoshop. I use Photoshop when it comes down to the heavy editing, or when I\"m trying to do something more creative with the image outside the abilities of the other two applications.\nI'm still learning Aperture so I cannot comment too much on its strengths and weaknesses vs Lightroom. Here is a post by Scott Bourne as to why he uses Aperture over Lightoom.\nHope some of what is here helps.\n\nA: Using Aperture/Lightroom require a different way of thinking to Photoshop.\nPersonally I use Lightroom as it is more like the traditional darkroom process. It's also quicker for getting lots of images out the door, which works well with my style of photography (motorsport), the editing functions aren't as deep, but they are pretty much the same as Adobe Camera Raw in Photoshop. Aperture is slightly different, but the same sort of style. Both Lightroom and Aperture have great image management databases which help my workflow a lot.\nIt is down to personal preference, although at 1/10th of the cost of Photoshop, Aperture is a bit of a bargain, if you can live without the extra editing features.\n\nA: The Aperture trial is the full version so if you're not happy with it buying it may not make you any happier.\nWhen you say Aperture isn't that good, just like Lightroom you imply that both Aperture and Lightroom aren't that good (compared with Photoshop) for your needs. You may have answered your own question.\nMany photographers shoot RAW and Aperture and Lightroom are built for editing RAW files. You can do this with Photoshop too but the Adobe RAW converter is needed to get a similar workflow to Aperture and Lightroom.\nSimply put, if you shoot RAW the deeper EXIF information isn't stripped out of your image by the jpeg compressor and a RAW image editor like Aperture or Lightroom will display that deeper EXIF information and allow you to control it after the image is taken.\nFor example, if you make a series of RAW images of friends in a room with incandescent light, those images will probably look a bit too warm or red. Lightroom and Aperture (and Photoshop with ACR) will allow you to quickly and easily use a pull down menu, choose \"tungsten\" and alter the white balance, usually perfectly on one or all of the images. Lightroom and Aperture both allow you to do things like this to batches of images with the same corrections needed. These kinds of batch processing tools speed up the processing of large groups of images.\nYou don't have to shoot RAW to change things after the fact in an image but the amount of control you'll have over a RAW image will be greater as it will contain more information for the RAW editor to latch on to and offer tools for.\nIf you routinely do heavy editing on individual images, HDR, cutouts, and use images in larger graphic design projects you'd certainly want to have Photoshop or other image editing software.\nIf you routinely do lighter editing on photographs, want to edit in batches, want better control of fine art printing, and want more of a photographer's workflow/process on working with images, Aperture and Lightroom are tools to consider.\nAnd, as others have said, it's not all or nothing, you can use Photoshop on top or (or underneath) Aperture and/or Lightroom for occasional heavy editing.\nAs for which is better, Aperture or Lightroom, that's a personal preference having more to do with UI and tools and feelings about Apple and Adobe.\nI use Lightroom even though I've had Aperture for years. I used them side by side for a while and while I prefer to use Apple products than get sucked into the Adobe world, for me, Lightroom is the better product with better image editing tools and a faster user interface on a wider variety of computers. It's noise reduction tools are so good they're worth the price alone. But, it goes much further with lens correction tools built in that correct for pincushion, barrel and lots of other distortions that many lenses (even high end lenses) make. I do a lot of architectural photography and the lens corrections are a spectacular feature for me.\nAnd, while I'd prefer to stay within the Apple fold, Apple has a checkered history supporting and/or updating their \"pro\" products. People's unhappiness with what Apple has done with Final Cut Pro is an example of this.\nI also have iPhoto on my computer and use it to capture my iCloud photo stream and while Apple products are better integrated into the Lion/iOS ecosystem, I still use Lightroom because it works better as an image editor for me.\n", "Q: Does it make sense to use Aperture 3 in combination with iPhoto or can you drop iPhoto? I've just ordered my first mac and as an impatient hobby photographer I've already been reading up a lot on Aperture and iPhoto.\nI've seen the iPhoto '11 presentation and was very impressed with the usability and cool features.\nBut I know that I will need Aperture eventually to work on my photos as I like to tweak a lot of things.\nI currently work with Adobe Lightroom and while I like its advanced stuff, I don't like the basics much such as the organizing, sorting, etc. What I saw in the iPhoto demo certainly looked a lot better.\nI'm still reading up on aperture but I think (this is only a guesstimate) that it will be less enjoyable and less easy to sort/browse/organize your photo's in it than iPhoto. I don't mind using something dumbed down, consumer grade to do this basic stuff, but I do like something more pro to do the actual editing.\nSo my question is..\nWhat's the workflow that other hobby/pro photographers here use to organize/edit their photos? Do everything in aperture? Start in aperture and export to iPhoto? Start in iPhoto and switch to aperture to edit individual photo's?\n\nA: You should consider Aperture to be a replacement for iPhoto. When you switch to Aperture, you will import your iPhoto DB of photos into Aperture and work with your photos exclusively in Aperture. The features that you are used to in iPhoto will be available in Aperture.\nAperture still have a 30-day free trial available from Apple. \nWhat you can do is make a backup of your iphoto library (because backup are good, right), import the photos into Aperture and give it a try. Over the next 30 days, when you import new photos, import them into both Aperture and iPhoto. This way, if you don't like Aperture, you still have an up-to-date iPhoto library. If you are going to switch to Aperture, then you can delete your iPhoto library to get back that space.\nI am a terrible photographer and I don't mind Aperture's way of organizing v. iPhoto. Trying to keep two applications in sync with photos, however, is not an ideal solution for long-term use, IMO.\n\nA: I use both\n\n\n*\n\n*Aperture to store and manage my hobby photography and any pro work I do\n\n*iPhoto to hold my family and friends snapshots (and manage my personal flickr, facebook and web gallery sites).\n\n\nIf I use the pro camera for any personal stuff, I process in Aperture, copy the final selections to iPhoto and remove them from Aperture.\nFor me, its best to separate hobby/business from pleasure.\n\nA: I see Aperture/Lightroom as pro versions of Lightroom, they do the same things. If you are happy with the iPhoto way of working, but want to do edits in more detail, I would suggest Photoshop Elements rather than Aperture.\nFWIW I occasionally go from Lightroom to iPhoto, but only if I want to do a photobook.\n", "Q: Can a 2nd Generation iPod Touch be upgraded past 2.2.1? I've got an iPod Touch 2nd Gen.  It has Software Version 2.2.1.  When I click 'Check for Update' in iTunes it says it's already running the latest version.\nIs iTunes right?  I thought I could update to iOS 4 (I only want to upgrade so I can get Bluetooth on the thing so I can use it in the car).\n\nA: Yes, it can. My 2nd gen touch is running 4.2.1 just fine and dandy. (It appears that, like the iPhone 3G, they won't get 4.3, though.)\nI'd recommend to download the 4.2.1 update from Apple directly and option-restore the update to your device.\n", "Q: Why can't I install OS X 10.6.6 combined updates? To be clear, I can't install any Mac OS X update at the moment.  I reformatted my disk and installed fresh off my Snow Leopard disk.

I have spent the last 2 days looking at this issue, trawling through forum posts, re-installing, verifying and checking my disk, trying 10.6.1 instead, reformatting again, doing a zero fill, the works.

I also zero-filled.\n\n*Ran the disk repair utility\n\n\nMy system ran updates absolutely fine before this.  Anyone got any ideas at all?\nCheers\n\nA: Sounds like some sort of silently corrupted download (I had an old router that did this occasionally).  Try a different connection using completely different modems, routers and access points.  Maybe even a different internet provider at a friend's house or office.\n\nA: This really sounds like a corrupted download problem -- the \"invalid checksum\" and \"The file couldn’t be opened because it isn’t in the correct format.\" errors strongly point to this.  Check the image file's size and SHA1 hash (note: Apple includes the hash in their download pages, e.g. here).  Here's what I get on the 10.6.6 combo update (in disk image format):\n$ ls -l MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.6.dmg \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  staff  1054916500 Jan  6 04:10 MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.6.dmg\n$ openssl sha1 MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.6.dmg\nSHA1(MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.6.dmg)= 868768cbc88db1895161f74030e98e8ce2303151\n\nIf your downloaded files don't match this length and/or hash, start digging into what's going wrong with the download.  Do all of you downloaded files have the same lengths and hashes as each other (i.e. how consistent is the damage)?  Try downloading with different browsers, via different internet connections, etc  (you might want to use a smaller test file, like the 10.6.1 update, if you find one that shows similar errors).  Look for a pattern in the errors and try to isolate where the problem's coming from.\n\nA: The issue is \"The file couldn’t be opened because it isn’t in the correct format.\".\nI would try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download using the \"Software Update\" program, not manually. Perhaps \"Software Update\" will do something differently, or the manual version is including something that shouldn't be included\n\n*Find out the md5 hash of the DMG you are downloading. Verify this. If the md5 hash doesn't match, then there is a problem with the download. Try downloading with a different browser. Try downloading via a different ISP.\n\n*If the md5 hash matches and you get this error, that means one thing. If the md5 hash doesn't match, then this error is expected, and this means something else. You need to know which it is. Leave a comment and further debug steps can be considered at that point.\n\nA: It wouldn't hurt to run Apple Hardware Test from the disk that came with your Mac.  I had this happen once with an Apple update back in the 10.4 days and it turned out that I had a bad RAM chip.\n\nA: hello Go to this webside and download the upgrade, then install it as an dmg file..\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1349\n/stefano\n", "Q: Automator choose finder folder and run shell script I've got a simple shell script that I would like to incorporate into an automator workflow.

I've found how to do this as a service, but I'd like it to work as an application.\nHow can I get to run in the chosen folder? Optionally a drag and drop onto the application would be nice as well.\n\n\nA: You can simply pass the selected folder to the shell script by selecting \"as argument\" from the \"pass input:\" dropdown-menu and then adding \"$@\" at the point in your script where you want the folder path to be used. \nTo use drag&drop, just remove the \"ask for finder items\" action and let the \"run shell script\" receive the input from \"application can receive files and folders as input\".\n\nA: The way I do this is define the path to a variable, then open up the workflow in a text editor, search for the variable, copy the string, then use $(string) anywhere in the workflow whatsoever (including shell scripts).\n", "Q: How do I run a cron job on a Mac? How can I make my Mac (running the most recent OS) do a task automatically once a day?

I have a feeling that some combination of wget and cron should work, but, after googling and reading the cron documentation, I just couldn't get it to work right.\n\nA: The cron daemon can be activated by a simple:\nsudo touch /private/etc/crontab\n\nThen it's advisable to enter the full path of your /usr/local/bin/wget (or wherever it lives). Cron does not know of your user's $PATH.

Its advantage is that when you set a job to run once a day, it runs whenever your computer is on, regardless of the time. So you won't miss a job because the computer was off at the specified time.\n\nMacaroni is a tool which handles regular maintenance for Mac OS X, including the Mac OS X repair privileges process as well as Unix-style maintenance.

Currently, I launch Screen Sharing app, and a window appears asking for a host to connect to. I'd like it to already have the host field populated with my last connected host. Is there any way to enable such functionality? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Don't know of a way to specifically do that, but you can set up browser bookmarks and/or desktop icons that will connect to specific hosts, if that's any help.  \nFor the former, create a bookmark that points to vnc://hostname.blah.com rather than the more usual http://hostname.blah.com.\nFor the latter, create a text file with the .command suffix (e.g. 'myvnc.command') that contains the single line:\nopen vnc://hostname.blah.com\n\nwhich will start the screen sharing session when you double-click it in Finder. You can also drag it to your dock if you wish.\n\nA: I used to put the ScreenSharing app icon in my dock, but I found a better way.\nFinder's general \"Connect to Server\" capability is wonderful. Click Finder, or Command-Tab to it, then in the \"Go\" Menu, choose \"Connect to Server\". Alternatively, if you're a keyboard freak like me, make Finder active then press Command + k.\nLike Calum's suggestion above, the vnc://hostname.local. URI is correct. However, this method (using the Connect to Server window) remembers the last server you connected too :).\nAs an aside, the Connect to Server dialog is infinitely flexible. You can put paths to Samba Shares (smb://), AFP Servers (afp://), VNC/Screen Sharing entries (vnc://), and almost anything with a protocol (except http/https, oddly enough) in there and it'll use it. FTP (ftp://) works, http:// works for Webdav sites, NOT websites, and more.\n\nA: Another way could be the following: \nOnce you are connected with screen sharing, take a closer look at title bar of Screen Sharing´s main window. Next to the name of the host you´re connected to, sits a little proxy icon that looks like a document. Click exactly on this tiny icon and drag it to your dock. This will create a file called hostname.vncloc in your dock which you can now click to directly connect to your host. \nFor additional comfort (if you haven´t done so already), while on the VNC connection prompt, make sure to check the checkbox prompting you to add the username and password you use for VNC to your keychain.\n\nA: Every time you open a screensharing location, Lion puts an .vncloc file in ~user/Library/Application Support/Screen Sharing.\nCopy that to your programs folder and make a shortcut in dock. Done!\nNote: Lion has Library folder hidden in default.

How long is it usually between when Apple releases a refreshed product and when authorized retailers like Best Buy and Target get the updates?\nI feel like when the last iPod refresh happened it took about a month before Target got the new ones. I ask because my wife is a Target employee and I'm debating how much I want to wait to get the new iPad vs saving 15%.\nUPDATE 3/4/11\nMy wife talked to the analyst, and she said Apple doesn't work with vendors before a release, and it's up to the specific vendor to scramble for orders once the product is announce.  Bestbuy and Walmart will be getting it on the first day.\n\nA: Authorized retailers can order the new units from Apple more or less at the same time the Apple Stores get the new stuff. But while Apple Stores get the new stuff out on the sales floor at launch, the other retailers, for whom Apple gear is a small part of their business, may take longer to get the new stuff shipped from Apple, into their inventory systems, go through their internal distribution, and get it on their floors. \n\nA: Some food for thought: I have been purchasing and using Apple hardware since 1994. I always like to wait for the 2nd (or sometimes 3rd) release of hardware products so that I avoid any design and/or manufacturing issues that they discover and fix in the first few months. I know it's mostly arbitrary and that there can be flaws and defects at any point, but in my experience, there tend to be more at the beginning of a product's life cycle than towards the middle and end. And yes, the iPad is not new, but the new iPad that Apple is minutes from announcing (hopefully) should be considered a new product since it mostly likely has some redesigned and/or new hardware elements.\nSummary: I wait 6-9 months before I consider buying the new hot product from Apple (anywhere, really) to make sure they have time to fix the initial problems.\nLike I said, food for thought. Good luck with your buying decision :)\n", "Q: How to force a diff format for TextMate? I have this alias:\nalias hgd='hg diff|mate'\n\nThe problem is that for some reason the temporary file thus created will be a .txt, while I'd need it to have the diff syntax highlight.\nIf I manually change the highlight to diff, then every .txt I'll open in future will use the diff highlight too.\nWhat can I do to fix that?\n\nA: TextMate can use either the file extension or the first line of a file to divine what filetype it is.\nFor my diff bundle (I think it's the original), this is:\nfirstLineMatch = '(?x)^\n        (===\\ modified\\ file\n        |==== \\s* // .+ \\s - \\s .+ \\s+ ====\n        |Index:\\ \n        |---\\ [^%]\n        |\\*\\*\\*.*\\d{4}\\s*$\n        |\\d+(,\\d+)* (a|d|c) \\d+(,\\d+)* $\n        |diff\\ --git\\ \n        )\n    ';\n\nI don't have mercurial, but it appears as though its diff's first line may look something like diff -r 2278160e78d4 hello.c.  As such, you can add another line to that big OR switch:\n        ...\n        |diff\\ --git\\ \n        |diff\\ -r\\ \n        )\n    ';\n\nNote that the final character in the line is a space.\nAs another alternative, it appears as though you may be able to define your alias as alias hgd='hg diff --git|mate' to use the same format as git, which is already recognized by TextMate.\n\nA: I don´t have any mercurial project myself, but if you do this in svn (eg. with svn diff -r 100:099) it generates a .txt too, but it uses the diff highlighting - maybe there is an update to the diff bundle available in your installation? \nIf not, you can still re-write your alias to something like hg diff > /tmp/hg.diff && mate /tmp/hg.diff\n\nA: Doing this with an alias won't work, but you can write a bash function that will handle this. Something like:\nfunction hgd {\n    T=`mktemp /tmp/hgdiff.XXXXXX.diff`\n    hg diff > $T\n    mate -w $T\n    rm $T\n}\n\nin your .bash_profile will work. This acts closer to what you're trying to accomplish in that it leaves no trace of the temporary file on disk when you're done looking at it with TextMate.\n", "Q: How can I email multiple camera roll images at once on an iPod Touch? When looking at my photos, I see that I can view a picture, click on the button the bottom left, and then click \"Email Photo\" but I now want to be able to email multiple photos into a single email.\nIs this possible on the latest iPod Touch?\n\nA: Assuming this works the same as on my iPhone 3Gs, you´ll want to go into the photo roll (not show an actual photo) and then tap the \"share\" button in the upper right corner (the one that looks like an arrow pointing out of a square) - you will then be able to select up to five images and tap on \"send\" to send them as an e-Mail.\n", "Q: How to get a notification when my commands are done I'm running a series of commands on the command line that takes approximately twenty minutes to complete.  I'd like to see some sort of notification on my Mac when these are finished so I don't need to monitor the terminal for when it finishes.  Is there a way to do this?\n$ svn update . && ant clean build start && *notify_me_somehow*\n\nEdit:\nI could use xclock but this seems like a hack.  Ideally I could send the notification anywhere, like my phone, screen, etc.\n\nA: I present in this answer two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The option of using afplay, which plays sound files, for notification.\n\n*my tools for reporting exit status along with the notification.\n\n\n\nI have this script, ~/bin/donebeep:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ \"$@\" = 0 ]; then\n  afplay -v 2 /System/Library/Sounds/Blow.aiff &\nelse\n  afplay -v 2 /System/Library/Sounds/Sosumi.aiff &\nfi\n\nThis plays a different sound depending on whether the argument is 0. Then I have an alias:\nalias donebeep='(savestatus=$?; ~/bin/donebeep $savestatus \"$@\"; exit $savestatus)'\n\n(That they have the same name is irrelevant and probably a bad idea.)\nTo use it in your example, svn update . && ant clean build start; donebeep. Note that I am using ; rather than &&, so that it can notify me on failure as well as success.\nBefore I learned about afplay, I used say to speak messages instead. The role of donebeep was played by this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nsay -v Bruce \"Done $(basename \"$(pwd)\"), $@.\" &\n\nThis script speaks the exit code directly instead of having two different messages. It also mentions the name of the current directory (to help clarify which task is done), and can be given additional text to say by passing parameters to the alias (that's why the alias has \"$@\" in it). Note the trailing & so that you do not need to wait for the speech to finish before getting a prompt.\n\nThe man page for afplay is incomplete; afplay -h lists all options:\nUsage:\nafplay [option...] audio_file\n\nOptions: (may appear before or after arguments)\n  {-v | --volume} VOLUME\n    set the volume for playback of the file\n  {-h | --help}\n    print help\n  { --leaks}\n    run leaks analysis  {-t | --time} TIME\n    play for TIME seconds\n  {-r | --rate} RATE\n    play at playback rate\n  {-q | --rQuality} QUALITY\n    set the quality used for rate-scaled playback (default is 0 - low quality, 1 - high quality)\n  {-d | --debug}\n    debug print output\n\n\nA: You can use the built-in osascript command to run an Apple Script that shows a notification, e.g.\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Command done\" with title \"Your title here\"'\n\nYou can string it together with a simple semicolon, e.g.\nyour-command ; osascript -e '....'\n\n\nA: (svn update . && ant clean build start && say done) || say error\n\nA: In Mac OS 10.8 and above you can send yourself Notification Center messages. There's a tool called terminal-notifier that you can download or install using Homebrew or Rubygems, e.g.:\nbrew install terminal-notifier\n\nCheck out https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier for more on this tool.\nTo simplify the common use-case of just caring about the fact of something in the terminal being done, add an alias to your .bash_profile:\nalias notifyDone='terminal-notifier -title \"Terminal\" -message \"Done with task! Exit status: $?\"' -activate com.apple.Terminal\n\nOr, incorporating Austin Lucas' answer, you can add a sound and icon badge with tput bel:\nalias notifyDone='tput bel; terminal-notifier -title \"Terminal\" -message \"Done with task! Exit status: $?\"' -activate com.apple.Terminal\n\nThen you can simply do:\n$ <long-running task> ; notifyDone\n\nOnce the long-running task finishes you'll get a nice modal popup:\n\nWhen you click the notification, it will activate Terminal. If you go to System Preferences > Notifications > terminal-notifier and change the alert style to \"Alerts\", the notification will persist until you dismiss it.\n\nA: You could also use the build in say command for notification, e.g.: say \"ant: build: done.\" See: man say in the terminal.\n\nA: I create a simple tool that does exactly this. https://github.com/vikfroberg/brb\nInstallation\nNode.js needs to be installed: http://nodejs.org\n$ npm install -g brb\n\nInstructions\n$ sleep 3; brb\n\n\nA: I wrote ntfy for exactly this purpose. It is cross-platform and can automatically send notifications when long running commands finish.\nIf you have Python's pip (most Linux distros and MacOS have it), here's how to install it and enable automatic notifications:\n$ sudo pip install ntfy\n$ echo 'eval \"$(ntfy shell-integration)\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n$ # restart your shell\n\nCheck it out at http://ntfy.rtfd.io\nIn addition to that, it also can:\n\n\n*\n\n*supress automatic notifications when the terminal is in the foreground (X11, iTerm2 & Terminal.app supported and enabled by default)\n\n*send cloud-based notifications (Pushover, Pushbullet, and XMPP) \n\n*be used to send notifications when a process ends (not the aforementioned automatic support)\n\n*manually send notifications (good for use in scripts!)\n\n\nA: Use Growl.\nIn the .dmg file, look for the extras, there's a growlnotify binary. Install it, something like in /usr/local/bin. Then you can use this command\ngrowlnotify --sticky --appIcon <icon> --message <message> -t <title>\n\nto show a popup, like that:\n\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal has some new status indicators to help with issues like this:\nIn tabs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activity: an activity indicator (spinning progress indicator) is displayed when there's been recent output to the terminal. This enables you to see whether it is currently busy or has completed a long process. (Or, of course, you can use it to tell when it has begun producing output after silently performing work for a while.)\n\n*Unread: an ellipsis \"…\" is displayed to indicate new, unread text in background tabs. When you select the tab, the indicator is cleared.\n\n*Alert: a \"bell\" is displayed to indicate when a BEL has been written to background tabs or background windows. In addition, Terminal displays a red badge on the application icon, indicating the number of \"unread\" alerts/bells in all terminals. If Terminal itself is in the background, it also bounces its Dock icon when a bell is played.\nIn minimized window Dock icons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activity: activity is indicated by displaying the name of the foreground process.\n\n*Unread: unread text is indicated with an ellipsis.\n\n*Minimized terminal windows show live content in their Dock icons. This can be used to see whether there's activity, or even to determine what the terminal is doing, if the output you're looking for is identifiable (e.g., a \"top\" display is fairly easy to recognize even at small sizes). This is especially useful when Dock magnification is turned on or you have room for a large Dock.\nIn addition, you could display something in the terminal to catch your attention (which would be visible even in minimized windows). For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display a large asterisk: banner \\*\n\n*Invert the display: printf '\\e[?5h'\n\n*Paint the display red: tput setab 1; tput clear\n\n*Sit in a loop, flashing the screen: while true; do printf '\\e[?5h'; sleep 1; printf '\\e[?5l'; sleep 1; done\nThere are also escape codes for manipulating windows (move, set size, zoom, minimize, etc.). You could zoom the Terminal window, for example:\nprintf '\\e[9;1t'\n\nSee \"window manipulation\" at http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html for details.\nAnother approach is to use AppleScript to display an alert in a separate window:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to display alert \"Build Completed\" message \"The checkout and build have completed.\"'\n\n\nA: I know I'm late to the question but I think there's a little missing piece that may be helpful. I've found that, while it's neat, having your terminal talk with you isn't exactly functional. What's better is something more subtile like this: \n\nAs Chris pointed out, Lion has added little notification badges when a BEL is thrown. You can throw it yourself this with the command: \ntput bel\n\nSo, if you're doing some work in the background and want a notification when it finishes you can try something like: \nping -c 5 www.google.com && tput bel &\n\nThis runs the ping command as a background task (the hanging & accomplishes this) and has it throw a simple alert when it finishes. Historically BEL has been used to make that [horrible] hardware beep, however Lion has tastefully replaced that with the \"invalid command\" sound effect, a notification badge, and the terminal icon bouncing twice in the dock. \n\nA: Here is my bash function (just put it anywhere in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:\nwatch(){\n  cmd=$@ # Somehow interpolate $@ directly doesn't work.\n  $@ && say 'Watch Completed!' && osascript -e \"display notification \\\"Completed: $cmd\\\" with title \\\"Watch Alert\\\"\"\n}\n\nTo use it: \nwatch echo 'hi there' \nYou can also customize the notification sound as documented here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115373/9622\n\nA: My problem with sounds and modal windows is that I cannot tell where they come from.  I currently work with a bunch of spaces, and sometimes upwards of 20 terminal windows.\nMy solution is portable to the unix side, and should work with anything that supports ansi escape sequences. This solution works with Snow Leopard, and will probably work with more ancient versions of terminal.\nSingle line in .bash_profile\nfunction watch { $* ; echo -n -e \"\\033[41m\" ;  echo $* DONE ;  date ;  echo -n -e \"\\033[0m\" ; }\n\nBreaking that down:\n$* expands to the original command I want to watch.\nfirst escape sequence changes background color to red\necho repeats the command (with red background, the word DONE.\nRunning Date tells you when it finished.\nlast escape resets the terminal to what it was.\n\nIf you don't like red, google ascii escape codes background color.  Note that this does not change the whole screen red, but just anything output after the command has finished.\n\nA: iTerm2 has a built-in mechanism to get notifications but you have to install the Shell Integration.\nWhen you start a long-running command, select:\nEdit > Marks and Annotations > Alerts > Alert on next mark (⌥Option+⌘Command+A)\n\nWhen the command prompt returns you can select between:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show Modal Alert Box\n\n*Post Notification (example screenshot)\n\n\n\n\nA: On macOS Monterey, one can issue from the terminal or a shell script:\nosascript -e 'display notification \"text\" with title \"text\" sound name \"default\"'\n\nTo allow such notification one must go to System Preferences > Notifications & Focus > Script Editor and select Allow Notifications and Alerts (display for three seconds) or Banners (display until closed). For silent ones, omit 'sound name \"default\"'\n\nA: Ubuntu ships the following alias in ~/.bashrc:\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n\nWith this, you can then do things like:\nmake; alert\nsleep 10; alert\n\nPerhaps there's an equivalent to notify-send in Mac OSX?  I've seen similar popup Windows in both Mac and Ubuntu.\n\nA: I made a script to solve this which is here. You don't need any extra software for this.\nInstallation:\nbrew install akashaggarwal7/tools/tsay\nUsage:\nsleep 5; tsay\nFeel free to contribute!\n\nA: I do that sort of thing all the time.  My command line might look like\n$ rm Gemfile.lock && bin/setup && bundle install --binstubs && say \"All\"; say \"done\"\n\nIf the bin/setup and bundle install commands complete successfully, I'll hear the system/dictation voice say \"All done\". If either of the first two error out, then the && chain won't be followed, and all I'll hear is \"Done\".\n\nA: I run into this issue a lot, not only with shell commands but anywhere else I need a notification when some process finishes. I found this site that gives you a URL, that when hit, sends you a text message. So you can run your command as such\n<some command> && curl <url> and you'll get a text when it finishes. Its at https://www.comunicake.com\n\nA: As others have mentioned I use && say done since it's the most simple.\nBut since you mentioned that you want to receive notifications on your phone, I'd recommend something we use at work - Nudge Notifier.\nIt's pretty neat and can send Mac, Slack, and Discord notifications for terminal commands. Even commands running over ssh.\nComes in handy when I'm out of earshot of my computer or just don't want to make obnoxious sounds at the office.\n\n", "Q: Count the number of open windows Is there a tool to count the number of windows I have open, including on all Spaces?\nI am curious and too lazy to do it manually. :)\n\nA: I guess this AppleScript should do:\nset numberOfWindows to \"0\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set allProcesses to application processes\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of allProcesses\n        tell process i\n            set numberOfWindows to (numberOfWindows + (count windows))\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Service Battery Warning I have a 13\" Macbook Pro (2009) and I randomly get the \"Service Battery\" warning.

Drag a window until the mouse cursor enters one of these zones then drop the window to have it cinch into place.\n\n\nA: Cinch ($7) works a lot like Aero Snap.\nMost of the time it's more convenient to use keyboard shortcuts though. For that I'd recommend ShiftIt. It's free, extremely simple and also has an action for Windows-style maximize.\nFor those possibly looking for snapping windows to screen elements: Zooom/2.\n\nA: Magnet, available on the Mac App Store for $7.99 by CrowdCafé is pretty good\n\nA: Since Spectacle from the top answer is no longer actively maintained, i would recommend Rectangle as the closest replacement for the Snap feature from Windows.\nBy default you could snap windows to the sides, top/button or in the edges.

I own an iPhone 4 and I am planning to buy an iPad. I am wondering whether I'll be able to use the tether feature in the iPhone to access the internet from the iPad over Bluetooth. If this works, I won't need to get a 3G-enabled iPad; if it doesn't, I'll need a 3G iPad. Any ideas? Thanks.\n\nA: iOS 4.3, available for free download on March 11, 2011, includes the Personal Hotspot feature introduced with the Verizon iPhone 4. You can get Internet access via 3G on the iPhone, then use your iPad via a WiFi connection to the phone to share the phone's Internet connection. It doesn't use Bluetooth, but it effectively works as well (better, in fact, since Personal Hotspot supports multiple connected devices and WiFi is faster than Bluetooth).\nHere is a story from Macworld that discusses how the Personal Hotspot feature works. It's pitched to the feature on the Verizon iPhone, but it should apply to the GSM iPhone 4's running iOS 4.3 as well. \n\nA: iOS doesn't support getting internet via tethering, so it won't work via Bluetooth. But iOS 4.3 brings WiFi hotspot to iPhone 4 so you can use that to get internet to the iPad. \n\nA: a note: This wifi hotspot will cost you more money through AT&T, as I understand it.\nIf I am correct, and you currently have an unlimited data plan grandfathered in from an original iphone plan, that change will change your data plan too! Be careful what you do and call and/or talk to an AT&T rep in person to confirm/negotiate what you want!!!\n\nA: I too have no internet via bluetooth when Iphone4 (4.2.2 and 4.3) is tethered to Macbook .  This appears to be broken in OSX 10.6.6 and 10.6.7.  10.6.5 was fine.  Wifi tethering with 4.3 works from Macbook.  However for Vista (Sony) and XP (Acer mini) I get wifi tethering but no internet connection.\n\nA: Bluetooth tethering is available via \"MyWi\" for iPhone/iPad (Requires jailbreak on both devices) Though it works great.\n", "Q: Screen Record my browser I need to record just my browser and nothing else on the desktop. Does anyone know how I can do that?  I know I can do a screen recording with QuickTime, but it takes the entire desktop. \nI want to stick a demo of something into a presentation, therefore just want the browser visible.\n\nA: Quicktime 10 (Lion) now allows you to record an area of your screen, not just the entire screen. Select \"File → New Screen Recording,\" click the red \"record\" button, and Quicktime will tell you:\n\n\nA: Screenflow is an excellent screencasting tool. It always records the whole desktop, but you can use its Crop Canvas tool after the recording is done to crop to just the browser screen.\n\nA: I used Snapz Pro X for a long time (now on OS X 10.6.6). It allows you to select the size of the screen you want to capture before you start capturing. I like the software and more importantly the support (once I misplaced the serial number after upgrading OS).\nIn my opinion, worth every penny. \nLink: http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/\nHope this helps. \nPlease mark your question as answered if this helps, thanks.\n\nA: Jing Basic is free and excellent.\n\nA: In the end I did the screen recording in quicktime and edited it in imovie. This had a cost of 0 which was pretty important for me as this isn't something I'd of typically done.  \n", "Q: Does the iPad 2 Support the iPad 1 Dock? I'm thinking about selling my first generation iPad, but was wondering if I should sell the dock with it. I know that they are coming out with a new iPad dock specifically for the second generation. Will it not fit on the first generation dock?\n\nA: It's possible to use the first generation dock, but it's a bit difficult to get the iPad 2 connected, because of the tapered edge: See this link.\n\nA: Hard to say for sure if the original iPad Dock will work with the iPad 2. Apple is selling an iPad 2 Dock, however, that is different than the original model.\n\nA: I would recommend waiting to sell the dock.  I would venture a guess that it will, however, not perfectly. eg, I use my iphone edge dock with my iphone 4 and I think it is great!\n", "Q: I have a keyboard that always comes up at unrecognized.

USB Overdrive?\n", "Q: Can I transfer and view xvid (avi) videos on an iPad? What type of video files can I watch on my iPad?\nI usually only have .avi files; is there an app that will allow me to play them?\n\nA: You could also try AirVideo, which will convert and stream xvid (and other formats) from a local PC.  You can connect to it via local network or remotely as well.http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/index.html\n\nA: You can use OPlayer HD to watch your video on your iPad. There's also a free ad-supported version available\n\nA: I usually use Handbrake to convert everything to .mp4 or .m4v (iTunes-friendly extension) before importing it to iTunes and syncing it to an iDevice.  Just open it up and give it a source file, pick the proper preset, and press Go.\n\nA: Another idea is converting your videos using Macroplant's Adapter. Quite simple to do.\n\nA: Use VLC for the iPad (link is directly to the apple store for VLC)\nQuicky guide through here\n", "Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of iBooks and Kindle books for my iPad? Even though I have had an iPad for a while, I haven't taken the plunge to buy any ebooks yet. I'd like to make a decision on whether to prefer buying iBooks or Kindle before I buy any so that I can keep my collection in one place.\niBooks or Kindle: What are the reasons to choose one or the other?\nI also have an iPhone for some reading, and don't imagine I'll ever buy the  Kindle hardware (as nice as they are at present).\n\nA: I use both. I use whichever one has the book I want for cheaper, and since I really only use the iPad to read with, I am not fussed by which one is cross platform. Since they are both free, and the books still have to be bought, and feature wise they are both fairly much the same in usability.\nOne large advantage of Kindle store books is that you can read them on your mac (or PC) whereas there is no good reading solution for iBooks on a mac (or PC). You can take both reading software through their paces using similar free books and sample chapters from the respective stores.\nIn general, the effort taken to digitize the books has far more influence on how they look than does the conduit / store used to buy them. Both companies have very good customer support and both have refunded me when a purchase was problematic or unintentional. I feel like both Amazon and Apple are looking to take care of me as a customer as opposed to a \"all sales final\" approach.\n\nA: iBooks for iPad is free. Amazon Kindle Reader for iPad is free. Both systems have free books that you can download and read. So install both, get some free books for both, and try them out. Then decide if you want to buy some books from one or both services.\n\nA: Kindle, because you can then read your books on any platform. If you buy them through iBooks, you can only read them on iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. \n\nA: My thoughts given the new iBooks Author release and the like:\nGenerally, not much has changed.\nThe iBooks reader app remains the superior app for reading on an iPad, and the introduction of the slick, interactive eBooks that will be coming out with the introduction of iBooks Author just solidify this.\n...but...\nThe Kindle App remains far more flexible if you care about having your library readable on multiple platforms. I didn't didn't think I cared much, but I've used both the cloud and Mac readers for the Kindle, and appreciated their availability. Apple has had more than enough opportunity to come out with clients - I think it's clear by now that its not a priority for them to do so.\nSo if you can only see yourself reading on an iDevice, go with iBooks. If you see yourself switching, dabbling, or going back and forth between an iDevice and any other format, stick with Kindle.\n\nA: I have both an iPad and a Kindle 3, and iBooks and Kindle books.  I find I read the Amazon ebooks more, since there currently seems to be a wider selection of ebooks to browse on Amazon, and more devices on which I can read Kindle content.  Just finished another Kindle book, mostly read on my iPhone 4, not the Kindle 3.\n\nA: I use both but generally find iBooks more capable. I have many pdf documents and iBooks handles them well (imported through iTunes on the Mac). Also the ability to almost effortlessly check a word definition with ePub books in iBooks is very useful (double tap and select 'definition'). This is a significant advantage over physical books where a dictionary offers the same functionality but is just not as likely to happen. Kindle has a much larger selection of books and I use it to get free samples.\n\nA: Get some sample chapters and see. I prefer the reading experience of the iBooks app, but it doesn't extend beyond my iPhone and iPad. Kindle books can be read on many more devices. \nIf you are prepared to fiddle, you can convert a purchased Kindle book into a normal ePub file which is readable in iBooks. You cannot do this the other way around.\n\nA: If the Price of the book is the same. Then I would go with the iBook version. \nYou can use the kindle app with no issues that I have found, but the iBook is a bit more refined and smoother in page turn animation (curl of page).\nOn the Kindle, I have turned off the page curls an set it to slide side ways. Because its not that great.\nBut both are good to read with and at the end of the day I do not hold a e-book in the same regard as a real paper one.\nWhere as with real paper books I will Try and by a Hardback as apposed to a Paperback. Price only coming into it if I am feeling skint.\n\nA: Without a doubt, iBooks. Apple created iBooks to work seamlessly with their own products. With that in mind, iBooks is sure to deliver the best reading experience on your iPad as opposed to any other reading app. For simplicity, choice, and integration between devices, iBooks is definitely the way to go.\n\nA: The iBooks app is better. But Amazon Kindle Store is cheaper and has a superior selection.\nThe books\nPublishers are responsible for creating and making available the books in each store. Sometimes a book is exclusive to one store. In that case, you have no option of where you purchase it.\nWhen a book is available in both stores, you must compare the price and quality on a book-by-book basis. This is easy to do because both stores offer free sample chapters. Books tend to be better formatted in the iBooks Store than in Kindle's Store. This can be critical for some genres, such as technical/programming books with graphics, code samples, and tables.\nThe ecosystem\niBookstore purchases can only be read on iPhone/iPod touch/iPad/Mac. Kindle purchases can also be read on Amazon's dedicated Kindle devices, Microsoft Windows, iOS, BlackBerry, Mac OS X, Android, webOS, Windows Phone, as well as in a web browser.\nThe apps\niBooks app:\n\n\n*\n\n*better interface (you even can turn off the skeuomorphic design features, if you prefer)\n\n*it has less features, but the features it does have are better: dictionary, highlighting, type/fonts, footnotes, navigation, look and feel\n\n*better PDF support\n\n*iBookstore built-into-the-app for convenient browsing and purchasing\n\n\nKindle app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sharing feature where you can publicly publish snippets from your book to kindle.amazon.com for linking-to in Twitter/Facebook. Example.\n\n*Amazon creates an email address for you to send documents to your Kindle via email. E.g. yourname@kindle.com\n\n*Con: You have to jump out to the web browser to browse and purchase content.\n\n\nOn an iPad, I prefer reading in iBooks because Apple executes the fundamentals better. Amazon's Kindle app has some nice differentiating features, though. All that said, at the end of the day, nothing's better than reading a basic novel on a standalone e-ink Kindle device.\n\nA: iBooks: Looks better, nicer store - feels more like a book. Books can also be interactive.\nKindle: Often cheaper, and crucially for me - works across devices from nearly all manufactures: My Windows 8 laptop, Kindle Paperwhite, Nexus 7 - you name it, there's probably a Kindle app for it. There's even a web based reader.\n\nA: You cannot easy annotate iBook pdf and I use Goodreader.  But iBook present better.  Hence sometimes I have to get to the PDF I send to iBooks.  \nIf you turn on the iCloud sync, it is in the iCloud drive but hidden.  You may like to use the following procedure to retrieve it.  \n\nIf you do not want to go through terminal (and use ls -al etc.) try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy a named pdf say \"a=pdf.pdf\" to ibook\n\n*search for a=pdf.pdf\n\n*if there is no such second copy, try this further\nadd pdf as a kind into the search field (whatever the search is) \nsearch for \"a\" instead of \"a=pdf.pdf\" (or any other possible filename)\njust a your file would appear (as the original copy) \nclick the open the enclosing folder\nIt works under El Captain just a moment ago.\n", "Q: Did they increase RAM in iPad 2? Since there was no hint about more RAM during the presentation yesterday, did anyone find out if they stay with 256 or (like iPhone 4) increased it at least up to 512?\n\nA: Apple never releases information about memory. The current rumour is 512 MB. You should wait until some opens it up (e.g. iFixit).\nAnd there you go . iPad-2-Wi-Fi-Teardown. 512 MB of Samsung manufactured RAM.\n\n\nA: You know, I know how much RAM is in the devices I choose as well. I used to be such a predictor of how well a device functions, but I have to admit that Apple's latest round of iOS devices make me not really care anymore. Why worry about when it functions so smoothly. I for one hope more hardware manufacturer's adopt this philosophy, \"Make it work well as an integrated device, not as a combination of desperate gadets\".\n", "Q: On connecting device - iTunes or iPhotos must not open Whenever I connect my iPhone/iPad/iPod to MacMini, It automatically launches iTunes & start syncing every time. I am a developer & I frequently need to connect/disconnect different devices. So, whenever I connect device, I force quit iPhone & iTunes. \nCan I eliminate the initial launch of iTunes and iPhoto when iOS devices connect over USB?\n\nA: You just have to change the prefs of those 2 apps. For instance, iPhoto you have to choose \"No application\" in the pop-up menu show hereunder :\n\nAnd you adjust the settings of iTunes the same way : just check the checkbox \"Prevent ...\". \n\n\nA: If you don't want iTunes to launch whenever you connect an iOS device, under your Account preference, in the System Preferences app, go to the Login Items tab and remove iTunesHelper.app.  \nThis is the app that monitor iOS device connector to launch iTunes.\nThis works when you don't control all the iOS devices that connect as you have to set each to not launch iTunes.\n\nA: You could also un-check the box \"Open iTunes when this i-Device is connected\".\nYou'll find this setting in iTunes, with the device connected and selected in the left hand side info bar. Then at the top, select summary (should default), then de-select that check box under options.\n\nA: If you are using Mac OS X Yosemite, you'll have to do another step. I followed these steps but it did not prevent Yosemite from opening iPhoto. Here is a link to preventing just the iPhoto launch from happening in Yosemite. \nDisable iPhoto auto launch when connecting an iPhone in Yosemite\n\nA: Perhaps this article should be updated with the new process for Photos? Launch Photos, Go through the setup process, select the import tab, next to the device deselect \"Open Photos for this device\".\n", "Q: iPad 3G A-GPS without contract Is A-GPS also working without an active 3G contract?\nSay I buy an iPad 3G with an operator SIM card in place but don't pay for 3G service, will A-GPS still work or not?\n\nA: The GPS will still function, but it will take a bit longer to lock onto your location. Also, note that the built-in maps app doesn't have maps stored on the device. It downloads them real-time. This will work fine if you have WiFi, but not if you're offline.\nTo use the GPS for offline navigation, you'll need an app that stores the maps locally.\nHere are some options:\nNAVIGON Mobile Navigator has pretty good reviews. It's $59.99 in the US Store, and it also works with the iPhone.\nCoPilot Live HD is half the price, but the reviews for it are pretty bad.\nMore info from Apple: (Click for source)\n\nVerify that you have a cellular or Wi-Fi network connection. This allows the Assisted GPS (A-GPS) on the device to locate visible GPS satellites faster, in addition to providing initial location information using the Wi-Fi or cellular networks.\n\nSo, in essence, it works with our without a cellular connection or WiFi. It's just faster with it.\nOne more source: A thread on this very question in Apple's support forums.\n", "Q: How can I reduce the resolution and storage size of photos synced to my iPhone? I want to sync many photos from my MacBook to my iPhone, but I realize that they really take too much space.\nI'm not exactly sure what resolution photos are scaled to when syncing with iTunes, but I would like to know if it is possible to lower it so that I can fit more photos in less space.\nIs there an automatic way to do this? I would like to avoid creating and storing lower resolution copies of the original images.\n\nA: Unfortunately your iPhone already does this with a majority of your photos, and maintains a specialized cache for this purpose, so I doubt there will be any programs to help with this. You can see this via http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1314 \nIf you want to rescale your photos in an automated fashion, and you are using your macbook, you can easily create an automator action to create smaller images with entire folders of images. However it seems like you don't want to maintain a second set of lower resolution images. \n\nA: It depends on the source of the photos.\niTunes has a default downsampling setting that isn't settable by any user control (and I've never seen any hint of a hidden command line preference to twiddle with that knob) however, you can control the source of the photos.\n\n\n*\n\n*Aperture allows you to change the default resolution for items in the Media Browser and that is where iTunes pulls the aperture photos - not directly from the original. You can even override the settings for just the photos you care to sync. You have control over maximum pixel dimension for the previews as well as JPEG compression.\n\n*You can export those pictures to a folder and sync from a folder on disk, but that involves the \"duplication\" work you referred to as cloning in the question.\n\n", "Q: how to quickly reboot from OSX to Windows and back From Windows back to OSX is fairly easy.  What I would like is a few less steps to get from OSX to Windows.  Currently I launch system preferences -> startup disk - then select the bootcamp partition and press restart.\nBeing completely new to OSX it seems to me that a one-click action on the dock should be possible with some sort of automation scripting.  Howerver I know nothing about OSX (yet) and how that works. First, is such a thing possible, and second please provide some tutoral links for such automation system.\n\nA: Here is an Automator workflow I wrote to accomplish rebooting to Bootcamp automatically:\nhttps://github.com/ryanmcginnis/Restart-to-Bootcamp\nAs of El Capitan, it is no longer possible to programmatically set the startup disk, even with SIP disabled.\n\nA: \nNote: This does not work on systems with System Integrity Protection enabled\n\nWrite a shell script that does this \n#!/bin/sh\n# tell OSX to change the boot disk \n# nextonly just for the next time - without the default would be Windows\n/usr/sbin/bless -mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP --setBoot  --nextonly  \n# reboot\n/sbin/shutdown -r now\n\nThis can be called from a terminal window \nsudo bootcamp\n\nThe use Automator to call this via an apple script and save as an application\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    do shell script \"/Users/mark/bin/bootcamp\" with administrator privileges\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: I'm really fond of rEFIt.\n\nrEFIt is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines like the Intel Macs. You can use it to boot multiple operating systems easily, including triple-boot setups with Boot Camp. It also provides an easy way to enter and explore the EFI pre-boot environment. \n\nThe OP seems to be interested about an OSX-to-Windows only command, so I guess this is not exactly what he wants. Still, I find rEFIt much easier to work with: if I want to go from one OS to another, I just need to reboot and then choose the OS I want.\nAnd if you ever need to work with 3 (or more) OS'es, you will see rEFIT is a much better option...\nIt also allows you to boot up from an external hard drive or a pen drive, which is a very nice bonus.\nEdit From the rEFIt page:\n\n2013-03-29: As you may have noticed, rEFIt is no longer actively maintained. Please check out rEFInd, a fork that is maintaned and under active development. \n\n\nA: It seems this script from SuperUser handles the closing of open windows (and stopping the scheduled restart if user presses 'cancel'):\ndo shell script \"hdiutil unmount /Volumes/<Windows_Partition> -quiet\"\ndo shell script \"bless -device /dev/disk0s3 -legacy -setBoot -nextonly\" with administrator privileges\ntell application \"Finder\" to restart\n\n\nA: Quick boot does it nicely. It's in the menu bar.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25414/quickboot\n\nA: What you can do is creating a shortcut to System Preferences / Startup Disk on your dock in which you can quickly change the startup disk to boot into Windows, directly.\nFor this, drag the StartupDisk.prefPane from /System/Library/PreferencePanes/ into the right side of your dock:\n\nNow, you can click it, unlock it, select BOOTCAMP and hit restart. This works especially well on newer MacBooks, because you can use Touch ID to unlock.\n\n\nA: Another way to get from OS X to Windows quickly is to use Bootchamp, which adds a menu bar item like this:\n\nFor my Windows-booting needs Bootchamp has worked well. \n(I learned about it from a similar question on Super User I once asked.)\n\nA: Hold ⌥ while booting, you'll get a prompt to choose which OS / drive you want to boot from!\n\nA: I wanted to use AppleScript instead of BootChamp since I had a problems with an always-running webapp when it resumed state when returning to OS X instead of launching regularly. Trying to bless the volume from an AppleScript did not work on my iMac with a 3TB fusion drive so rebooting after the bless would lead to an error screen \"NO BOOTABLE DEVICE - INSERT BOOT DISC AND PRESS ANY KEY\".\nWhat I had to do was bless the HDD's EFI disk id with the -device switch, mount the BootCamp volume with the -mount switch and skip the -legacy switch. For me the HDD's EFI partition disk id was disk1s1 but you can verify yours by running diskutil list in terminal and look for the EFI device from the HDD (not the SSD).\nI also wanted to do a \"clean\" restart so my applications would not resume when returning to OS X so I created an AppleScript that quits specific apps before continuing to the bless and reboot:\ntry\n    set apps to {\"Safari\", \"Google Chrome\", \"Mail\", \"Twitter\"}\n    repeat with thisApp in apps\n        tell application thisApp to quit\n    end repeat\nend try\n\ndelay 2\n\ndo shell script \"bless -device /dev/disk1s1 -mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP -setBoot -nextonly\" password \"YourPassWordHere\" with administrator privileges\ntell application \"Finder\" to restart\n\nYou could skip the part about the password if you don't want to store your admin password in the script in plaintext.\nIf you put the script or an alias of it to ~/Library/Scripts and enable the Script Menu from Script Editor's preference you get an easy way to run it like with BootChamp.\n", "Q: Why are apps purchased on iPhone and iPad being deleted from device when synced? Apps that are purchased on my devices are deleted from the devices when I sync them with my desktop. iTunes states that the purchases are being transfered, but they are still deleted and do not show up under the iTunes app list. What is causing this?\n\nA: For some reason when it syncs, it sometimes only remembers the iTunes information and doesn't read the device information. So you may find that after syncing it will deleted apps you'd installed and install apps you'd deleted. It's very annoying. To get around that, I have set my devices to not automatically sync when plugged in. When I do plug them in, I right click the device name, click Transfer Purchases, and after that has been completed then I sync. \n\nA: There's not enough information to diagnose what's wrong with your iTunes and/or iPhone/iPad. \nThat's definitely a bug, since transfer of apps into iTunes should happen, did you seek customer support?\nPS: Make sure your computer is authorized to have those apps.

I'm using Spaces, and opening a link in some application outside of Google Chrome while being on a different Space than the last used window of Chrome results in Chrome switching to the last focused window.\nThis behavior is just bad.\nI want to change this behavior. On Windows, this is possible: How can you configure Chrome to open new browser instances in new windows rather than in a tab?\nSadly, I don't think this is possible on OS X Snow Leopard.\nI'm already using a tool called RCDefaultApps. This is a system-control panel where I can specify default applications for different protocols. It just lacks the feature to specify additional command line arguments for the default application.\nCan anyone help me there? Every hacks (aside from creating a custom Chromium build) are acceptable.\n\nA: You can try using the AppleScript found on this page.\nI just tried it out and it perfectly works fine in Chrome 12.0.742.122.\nIt's extremely easy to set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the Bundle archive\n\n*double click it to unpack it\n\n*double click on OpenUrlInNewChromeWindow\n\n*open Safari and set the new \"Browser\" as the default browser in the Preferences.\n\n\n\n\nA: Starting at Dave’s answer, I found that with Chrome 45, running osascript is no longer needed, and that with OS X 10.10, the Apple Script is not selectable in the system preferences. Here is how I solved it.\nCreate an Apple Script using the Apple Script editor, and export it as an application.\non open location theURL\n   do shell script \"/usr/bin/open '/Applications/Google Chrome.app' --new --args --new-window \" & theURL\nend open location\n\nInstall RC default app.\n\nRCDefaultApp is a Mac OS X 10.2 or higher preference pane that allows a user to set the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types, MIME types, and Uniform Type Identifiers\n\nIn the system preferences, open the new default-apps screen, go to the URL tab, and set the exported Apple script as handler for http and https.\n\nA: I've been unable to make it work too. \nWhat I was trying to do was to use the following command:\nopen Google\\ Chrome.app/ --new --args new-window www.google.com\n\nBut that opens a new Chrome that instantly closes (if Chrome is already open). I was planning on wrapping the above command within a bash script and then let it have arguments (for the URL). \nBut since the above command failed to work, I'm still thinking about this. So far I believe it's not \"possible\" without some modification to Chromium, but I might be overlooking something. It's early and I haven't had coffee yet. ;)\n\nA: This works on Mavericks:\nopen /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --new --args --new-window https\\://www.google.ca\n\nfollowed by:\nosascript -e 'activate application \"Google Chrome\"'\n\nTested in sh, bash and zsh.\nFor some reason, if I try to put them on the same line like so:\n/usr/bin/open /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --new --args --new-window www.google.ca; /usr/bin/osascript -e 'activate application \"Google Chrome\"'\n\n...the second part doesn't complete.  I assume that's because it's too close on the heels of the first command.  So try this:\n/usr/bin/open /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --new --args --new-window www.google.ca; sleep 1; /usr/bin/osascript -e 'activate application \"Google Chrome\"'\n\nNote that you don't need to specify the http:// part of the url at the end for it to work, but if you do, you need to escape the colon (:).\nTo make this script my default browser, I created an applescript and exported it as an application and then opened Safari Preferences and set the application as my default browser.   Here's the Applescript code:\non open location theURL\n  do shell script \"/Users/[myusername]/bin/openUrlInNewChromeWindow.sh \" & theURL\nend open location\n\nReplace [myusername] with your actual username.\n\nA: Security addition to the other answers [1]\nOne should quote the URL for security reasons and as it might contain special characters which need escaping when used as a string in bash (e.g. '&' and '$'). \nOtherwise the opened URL might be wrong and a maliciously crafted URL could even run an arbitrary command on your machine.

For example, searching for a specific keychain item in the example above using name contains instead of name is does not work. You would have to use a repeat statement similar to what @Philip posted:\ntell application \"Keychain Scripting\" to tell keychain \"login.keychain\"\n\n    repeat with x from 1 to (count every Internet key)\n        if name of Internet key x contains \"Google\" then\n            return {account, password} of Internet key x\n        end if\n\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIf you´re okay to use the command line and just want to look up stuff, I´d rather use:\nsecurity find-internet-password -g -s www.google.com and then grep what you want.\n\nA: Keychain scripting is pretty well broken in Lion, so the security command-line tool is your best bet.

It's a kind of ticking noise. This is happening since a few months ago. I have not changed any hardware. I have never encountered any other problems with my iMac and it has never crashed. My Mac is running normally and fast.\nHere is what iStat says:\n\n\nI have an Intel iMac (iMac9,1), Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.66 GHz, 2 GB RAM, running Mac OS X 10.6.6.\nI have tried to reset the SMC but this did not help.\nHow can I make this noise go away without opening my iMac or sending it back to Apple?\n\nA: Your fans are running at speeds appropriate for that model. Even using a stethoscope on the rear of an iMac, good techs have been confused between hard drive and blower noise unless you can change the noise by increasing or decreasing the fans or the HDD.\nRhythmic blower ticking is one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Failing or failed bearings in the blower.\n\n*Foreign object (paper, hair, other) lodged in the blower.\n\n\nChoice #2 is less likely since the airflow around the unit usually precludes things getting stuck there. Also the design makes it unlikely things large enough to make noise or stick can enter the blower area.\nI wouldn't recommend shaking an iMac (running or not), but tipping it on a side or upside down with a friend's help and then powering it on would let gravity and the airflow dislodge all but the most unlucky piece of debris from a blower. Be aware that succeeding to move debris may land such debris in a worse place than a blower, so do use caution. \nIf the bearings are the cause - you might try a fan control software to run the fans faster (sometimes higher speeds are less noisy) but do get ready for a visit to the shop as bearings don't fix themselves and the noise will get worse as it wears. A technician is the best person to get debris out and truly resolve a ticking noise whether it's a hard drive, optical drive or a blower.\n\nA: I haven't checked to see if smcFanControl will work with your particular mac, but I have used it for several MacBook (pro and consumer) and even on my desktop tower mac (all intel) to control the fan speed. For example, when I was playing WoW in full-screen mode, I would increase the fan speed manually to keep the temp down and then reduce it when I was done. It has a nice menu bar widget that shows the current RPM and temp. \nYou might be able to use this widget to manually set the speed lower to reduce the noise. I would recommend you try to further investigate the cause of the issue so that you don't inadvertently burn out your computer. One activity you can do to narrow down the cause is when you see/hear the fan increase in speed, check your Activity Monitor application to see what is taking the most CPU. You will find this application in your Utility Folder. Once launched, use the popup to see All Processes and then sort by %CPU column.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If there is a \"ticking noise\" when the fan runs, then I am willing to bet you have an object of some kind that somehow got stuck against the fan and the fan blades are hitting as they rotate. Crack open the shell and give it all a good blast with some canned air. But, if it's not something visible, then I would say take it to an Apple Store.\n\nA: These are all good ideas so mine is just a shot in the dark.  Try vacuuming the vents along the bottom of the display.  The loose item may pull clear if there is one and worse case, you've removed some dust and the fans may not run as often.  \n\nA: Well, granting you haven't restored your OS, you should still have the Apple Hardware Test on your system. Give that a whirl and see what it comes up with. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509\n\nA: Have you been excessively playing games/running the Fan before that? I had the problem of a rattling Fans as well on a MBP, but it started quite subtle and then went on to sound as well like a piece of cardboard. However it was not related to anything beeing stuck in the Fan, but it was simply the lubricant dying. So I went to Ifixit.com disassembled my macbook. I was also able to disassemble the Fan by opening the screws on it,  and pulling out the rotor. Then I cleaned the rotor shaft and applied silicon oil to it and put it back in. (I tried other oil as well but it would not work like silicon and the fan would start to rattle again (motor oil, \"special\" electronics oil, etc))\n", "Q: Can I update an existing Apple ID with a newly created MobileMe email address? I've had an Apple ID for a while now and have many iTunes purchases associated with the account. Yesterday, I created a MobileMe account. I tried updating the existing Apple ID account e-mail with my new MobileMe address, but get an error about the MobileMe address already being associated with an iTunes account (I'm guessing it's automatically created when you create a MobileMe account). Is there a way to update my existing Apple ID to use my new MobileMe address so that I don't have to repurchase all of the apps and things I've downloaded on my original account?\n\nA: As I have attempted to do this myself, Im pretty sure you cant combine the two. You can try contacting Apple Support but they will probably tell you the same thing.\nApple doesn't allow you merge AppleIDs or in other words use a mobileme AppleID for an iTunes account AppleID ( AppleIDs are just the username/email address I think). This sounds reasonable though because mobileme is a  yearly paid service and in the instance you canceled the mobileme account, it might lead to account problems (ie if you needed to reset your password for your iTunes account but it still had the mobileme email address as the AppleID/email)\nYou should still be able to make iTunes purchases, app purchases, etc with the original iTunes account you had set up. \n\nA: You can call AppleCare as suggested and merge all your purchases from the old Apple Id to the new Apple Id.\nI have multiple Apple IDs. Is there a way for me to consolidate them into a single Apple ID?\nSorry, but this is not possible at this time via our online tools. You can speak with an AppleCare representative, who can help you consolidate your registered Apple products. They can also help register your iPods, iPhones, or Mac computers under a single Apple ID.\nOther links that could offer some insight: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleid.apple.com/html/en_US/faq.html\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/appleid/\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HE40\n\nA: Log onto your newer MobileMe account and change the email address to something else, say one of your temporary email addresses.  Wait a bit.  Then change your old account to use the MobileMe email address.\n\nA: I doubt that it is possible to merge a mobile me account with your apple id, but try contacting the support - I think they are the ones to know for sure.

Do the new (2011) MacBook Pros work with Apple's Remote Control?\nI'm little confused because the Apple Store offers me an Apple Remote when I try buying a new MacBook Pro, but I don't see any information about support for that remote in the MacBook Pro's description.\n\nA: From the Manual for the 13inch, here is a picture that shows you where the IR port is located.\n\n\nA: Yes it does support it. You can verify this information because when you go to the apple store and select a new model, one of the accesories you can add to your purchase is the apple remote. They wouldn't add that if you couldn't use it :)\nI assume the IrDA port is there @ the front of the machine, possible hard to see in the official pictures. \n\nA: Yes it does. If you have the dock which supports it try not to put them close as it's the closest IR connection to you that picks it up!\n", "Q: Universal method to record calls via Bluetooth in OS X 10.6? I am a freelance journalist who needs to record calls for accuracy and legal reasons -- I inform every person I record that I am doing so, so *PLEASE* do *NOT* post asking about the legality of recording calls. Don't even mention it. I don't give a rip. I've sat through more lectures on this topic than you — trust me.\nMy phone runs Android 1.5, and all of the call recording software sucks. Like, it isn't even serviceable -- all calls are recorded via the internal microphone, resulting in one needing to use speakerphone to even hear the other side in recordings. Apparently my HTC Dream uses two different circuits for each side of the conversation, making full-duplex recording on the phone itself impossible.\nGiven the general crappiness of these apps, I've started to look for workarounds. One idea I had was to use my laptop as a Bluetooth handsfree device, then using a separate program like Audio Hijack to record audio. I've tried Phone Amego and BluePhoneElite2; Audio Hijack somehow receives no audio data when hijacking both (and both inexplicably have no recording function).\nIs there a piece of software that is able to record audio from Bluetooth handsfree? \nI don't even need a full Mac OS X telephony suite; ideally, I'd be able to use my phone as normal, but record the call via Bluetooth on my Macbook Pro.\n\nA: Returning to this question several years later, it's still a pretty sad state of affairs. The only reliable answer is some sort of hardware solution.\nIn practice, this is what I ended up buying:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Olympus-TP-8-Telephone-Pick-Microphone/dp/B007OXMHDE/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1400147804&sr=8-11&keywords=voice+recorder+microphone\nIt works really well; you connect the jack to a voice recorder and put the earbud in your ear, which has a microphone and sits between your ear and the phone's speaker. The quality isn't bad (albeit not broadcast quality) and the ability to use an external voice recorder means I'm not having to deal with moving files off my phone or expend extra battery power on a recording app.\nThat said, this looks really interesting (Though I'm unsure whether you just connect it to your phone and use normally, or whether you connect some sort of hands-free headset to the other side):\n\nhttp://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/05/12/15-quirky-gadgets-accessories-buy-today-2/2/\nConsidering the question is ultimately about finding a cheap or free software-based recording solution, I'll leave it open in case anyone comes up with something workable.\n\nA: Audio Hijack grabs audio at the OS level—anything coming out of the speakers has to go through the OS at one point or another—so I'm surprised AH can't grab the audio of those apps, but maybe it's a Quicktime thing that those apps are bypassing. Maybe give AH's devs a shout and see if they know a trick that will work. But, enough nerd talk...\nIf Audio Hijack can't do it, then I would go with a hard hack. Griffin has a cable that can redirect a call to external speakers and has a microphone to speak into. You should be able to output the receiving caller's audio to speakers and then capture that and your voice with your laptop's microphone. It will take some futzing with speaker placement to get the mix right, but it should work.\nNone of this is nearly as clever or convenient as hands-free Bluetooth, but that whole notion seems pretty well shot down anyway.\n\nA: Routing your call through Google Voice or making your own hardware are the best options for someone that will make a lot of recordings. Most of the apps that do this are subscription or ad-encumbered and not something you can buy.\nAnd there's the place the iPhone in speaker mode on the table and record the room with any old microphone based recorder. The H2 Zoom is really amazing and will time stamp your recordings for you. If you want good quality and it to stand up legally, you'll want something that's not an app or hacking together signals through a computer. Who is to say you didn't record things later or switch in a second edit?\nGood luck - it will be nice to see what else is out there. It would be nice it there were a small lead that would tap into the in-ear microphone / headphones and plug into the stereo input - each party on one channel - but I'm not aware of anyone selling that commercially yet.\n\nA: Here's an idea\nPay for Skype or Nimbuzz out, so that you are using Mac software that should work with Audio Hijack.\nTheir system is the one that integrates with the POTS. Your Mac would just be receiving digital audio data.\n", "Q: Printopia (AirPrint): turn it on/off via command line? I love Printopia - this allows my iDevices to print to a printer attached to my Mac. The problem is I usually don't leave it on all the time. Whenever I want to print from my phone, I'd turn it on via System Preferences app.\nQuestion: is it possible to do so via command line? This way I can ssh in my Mac and turn it on/off (or even better, write some simple script to automate the process).\n\nA: There's no real reason that I can think of not to leave it on all of the time, but you can easily turn it on and off by loading or unloading the launchd plist:\nThis will turn it on:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ecamm.printopia.plist\nThis will turn it off:\nlaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ecamm.printopia.plist\nOr you could just run the server directly:\n/Library/PreferencePanes/Printopia.prefPane/Contents/MacOS/Printopia Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Printopia Server\n(that's all one line)\n", "Q: How to add e.g. Chrome permanently to Guest account's dock?

I've now got an iMac and I'm using iPhoto to manage all my photos (linked to the server, not managing the files locally). \nHow can I still use iPhoto to import my photos and videos from my iphone and camera, but keep the files on my server for backup purposes? I don't want to fragment my collection over many machines\nThanks\nJames\n\nA: You can move the iPhoto archive in your Photos folder in your Home folder to a location on the external drive, create an alias in Mac OS X from the new location, and drop that where the archive used to be in your Photos folder in your Home folder. iPhoto will automatically redirect to the external drive. I do this at home and it works great. As long as that external drive is backed up, you're all set. \nOtherwise, you will have to use backup software (not Time Machine in this case) to ensure backups are made from the internal HD to the external hard drive on an automatic, ongoing basis.\n\nA: I keep all my photos on a storage server, organised in folders by year, month, date of capture. So my file structure looks something like this:\n - 2009 \n - 2010\n - 2011\n  - 2011.01\n  - 2011.02\n  - 2011.03\n   - 2011.03.01\n   - 2011.03.02\n\nThis is for storage of originals only. You would need to import photos from your phone and camera with something other than iPhoto (for example OS X built-in Image Capture app), then copy the files over to your storage server. This could be automated, but i do it manually, reviewing the photos and removing duds.\nI then use iPhoto to grab the photos from the storage server, so they're stored in the iPhoto library of my main machine. \nSome or all of the iPhoto library can be shared in Preferences > Sharing, so that other iPhoto machines on the network can see the contents of the library.\nThis should work for you as well, i guess. It's not really elegant -- what i'm looking for server version of iPhoto -- not sure that day will ever come!\n\nA: This is a one-time sync, but might be part of the puzzle:\nIn iPhoto, select the photos you want to move to the Windows server, File -> Export and choose a memorable folder, like Desktop/iPhoto.\nMount your windows volume, say through Finder (which will mount it to /Volumes) or some other means.\nOpen terminal and perform the following command:\nditto ~/Desktop/iPhoto/ /Volumes/Users/your_username/Pictures/iPhoto/\n\nAdditionally, you can find the iPhoto library under the following directory. Problem is that it's not structured in a simple format.\n~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.photolibrary/Masters/\n\n", "Q: What activities cannot be interrupted? Time was, Macs crashed a lot. (Maybe PCs did too, but I've only ever used Macs). And over time, I became wary of doing two things at once.\nToday I wouldn't interrupt a back-up but I'm wondering -- is it okay to touch the keyboard during other long-running stuff like a big delete or download? Are there times when one should just leave an activity alone?  \n\nA: Well, first of all, touching the keyboard will not crash you computer, even if you're doing heavy process.\nSo if you're deleting a big number of files or downloading a big file, you can still go ahead and browse the web or write on a text editor, or whatever.\nAnd even if Safari or Pages would crash, the OS is robust enough not to let this crash affect the download.\nTo sum it up, go ahead multi-task! Mac OS X is a really strong OS and you shouldn't worry about asking him to do multiple things, he's great at it.\n\nA: Software still crashes a lot, but moderns OSes (Windows too!), are much better at Sandboxing, a OS software technique which prevents a piece of software which crashes from affecting other running software, or the system stability.\nRealistically, the only processes which absolutely cannot be interrupted is hardware interfacing, which is almost invariably confined to drivers.\n\nIt's worth being aware that it was never Macs or Windows Hardware that crashed a lot, it has always been mac or windows applications that are more or less buggy. Indeed, the era of windows 98 BSODs was largely due to the popularity of windows spawning many thousands of poorly written, buggy pieces of software, together with Win98's poor ability to prevent software crashing from affecting overall system stability.\nHowever, both OS X and Windows have come very far since then, so ther really isn't any task during which multitasking is likely to cause crashes, unless the task itself is composed of poorly written/buggy software.\nThere are certainly processes which are slowed down by multitasking (sometimes more dramatically then one would expect, hard drive intensive tasks come to mind), but there are no tasks which would be damaged or broken by multitasking, only delayed.\n\nA: There are a few things that should be done more-or-less alone.  A backup is a reasonable example (although Time Machine tolerates it well), and an even better example would be verifying the structure of the boot volume (this'll abort if there's too much disk activity), or live repartitioning of the boot disk (similar).  There are also some combinations that should be avoided, like switching network connections or settings during a download.  For the most part, though, OS X is set up to multi-task cleanly and safely, so don't worry about it too much.\n", "Q: iOS RSS reader App for offline browsing? I am looking for an iOS app (iPhone and/or iPad) that lets me store read articles permanently for easy offline browsing.\nI have tried a bunch of the ones out there, but somehow they just don't work.\n\nA: Reeder will do just what you ask for.\n\nA: In the title you ask for RSS reader offline. But you also request for \"offline browsing\" and say nothing about RSS in the body.\nSo, I guess, what you really want is Read It Later (RIL). It doesn't offer offline RSS, but for a good reason: RSS is meant to feed in content, and RIL is content you hand-pick for later offline access.\nBut if you want specifically RSS, then you should probably pick Byline, as @Weirdo suggested.\n\nA: I like Byline\nIt does not store articles forever, however, but it caches up to 250 articles and Web pages they link to for offline reading; very handy for crippled RSS feeds that do not include the whole article, but just a teaser and a link to the Web page.\nIt syncs with Google Reader and there is a free, ad-supported version and a reasonable priced app without ads.\nYou can download it from the App Store.\n\nA: I use Reeder coupled with Instapaper: see something I want to salt away for offline reading, tuck it into Instapaper which caches it nicely.\nInstapaper also displays pieces in an \"iBooks-like\" way for easier reading with typographic control and more.\nhttp://www.instapaper.com/\nThe nice thing about this combo (one could also use Read Later) is that Reeder lets you set up a simple button to do the salting away on its services panel. Very slick.\n", "Q: How do I extract the audio signal from displayport? I have a macbook pro with minidisplayport (MDP) out.  It's plugged into an external monitor.

I want a cable that goes from MDP to MDP+Audio so that I can feed the audio into something other than my Apple Cinema display (which has cruddy speakers).\n\nA: Since I don´t assume anyone to ever build a mini DisplayPort to miniDisplayPort+Audio Adapter, and the option of going mini-DP<>Dual DVI<>mini-DP seems to be quite expensive and bulky, why don´t you simply use the optical audio from your MacBook Pro´s audio output?\n", "Q: Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver I'm trying to install \"Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver\" and I'm getting message:\nYou can't open the application Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver because the Classic environment is longer supported.\nWhat can I do in order to get it to work?\n\nA: Look for updated drivers.\nThis is an app written for Mac OS 9, so there's really no way to get it to work with a computer running OS X.\n", "Q: Is there a C compiler for iPad? I would like to study C using iPad. Just simple programs. So, is there a C compiler for iPad?\n\nA: If you have an internet connection, you could use codepad.org. They let you compile many different languages from code you paste into a web form. Supports a lot of formats and has some nice sharing features.\n\nA: If you're willing to jailbreak, the answer is yes. You can install GCC (the same open-source C compiler included with XCode) on your iPad.\nThe process is a bit complicated, but it's certainly possible. You can find instructions here. The instructions I've linked only mention the iPhone, but the same process should work on the iPad.\nIf you're not willing to jailbreak, then the solution VxJasonxV suggested might be your only option.\n\nA: Apple does not allow running any executable (machine) code other than that approved by the App store review process to run on an iPad.\nIt might be possible to port a C interpreter to the iPad, as long as it was disabled from downloading C code.\n\nA: There are no C compiler App Store apps for any iOS device due to a clause in the iOS Developer Program License Agreement which basically says that:\n\n\"Apple's iOS SDK prevents any software on the iPhone from downloading or running external executable code\"\n\nThat is taken from wikipedia. I believe I can't link to the agreement for some reason or another.\nIf you just want an editor you might look at Project Edit.\nEDIT:\nLooks like the terms were updated but maybe only interpreted code is allowed like what the Pythonista app does for Python but not for compiled code.\n\nA: A cursory look at the iTunes Store reveals CodeToGo (iTunes Store Link). Since you cannot compile on the iPad itself, this app leverages a web service (IDEOne) in order to run the program and return the results to your device. The app is USD$3 and a universal binary (iPhone+iPad). The web service appears to be free, if not just a little ugly :).\n\nA: The CppCode ios app supports code-complete and does not require jailbreak and internet connection\n\nA: PowerC++ is an alternative to CPPCode if your iPhone does not support iOS 8 which CPPCode requires. But PowerC++ only uses a C++ Builder installed in a DOS environment customized for iOS. It seems a bit out of date and doesn't support newer versions of the C++ standards.

I use Firefox on my Mac and have hundreds of website passwords saved in its password store. I don't even remember my passwords half the time for the various sites that I use. How can I sync the usernames/passwords between the two devices? I'd also like to be able to sync my bookmarks if possible. I use Firefox Sync to keep my various computers in sync, but of course this will not work with the iPad. \n\nA: For passwords, I highly recommend 1Password.\nIt will enter the passwords into Safari for iPad and it will sync your passwords with your Mac (if you setup the sync), and then you can search for what you need on the iPad.\n\nA: You can synchronize your Firefox bookmarks with your iPad using iTunes:\nhttp://www.softsailor.com/how-to/47239-how-to-sync-firefox-internet-explorer-safari-bookmarks-with-your-ipad-iphone.html\n\nA: Since nobody else mentioned it, I'll suggest LastPass -- it's another password manager very similar to 1Password. Lastpass acquired Xmarks (a bookmark synchronizing engine for all four major browsers) and you can get a LastPass + Xmarks bundle to sync both your passwords and bookmarks.\n\nA: Firefox Home is intended to sync as much data from Mac Firefox to the iPad as possible. If that's not enough, you'll need a desktop program to get firefox syncing data to Safari and then through MobileMe or USB to the iPad.\nI'd go with 1Password for passwords and Firefox Home for the rest.\n\nA: If you create a Firefox account, you can sync your bookmarks and passwords across all devices. I created an account so I could access all my bookmarks and password across an android, iOS, windows, and Mac devices. It works brilliantly to sync everything and back up your information. \n", "Q: Any way to get more powerful rules for Mail.app? Is there a way to enhance Mail.app with better rules?\nWhat I'm missing most is regexps and the ability to group conditions and not only get \"If all rules match\" or If one rule match\"\nAlternatively is there a way to use apple-scripts as rules?\nNote:\nI'm not after Junk Mail Filtering\n\nA: There is no way I can think of to use AppleScript to filter messages directly, but I guess you could go the ugly route of redirecting \"All Messages\" to an AppleScript and then handling them from there back to Mail.app.\n==== Update:\nTo give you a better idea of what I´m talking about, you´ll have to create a new rule with condition \"All Messages\" and execute an Applescript. For example to check for the subject, you´ll want something similar to this:\nusing terms from application \"Mail\"\n    on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n\n            repeat with eachMessage in theMessages\n                set theSubject to subject of eachMessage\n\n                if theSubject contains \"test\" then\n                    -- do something here, like move message to a folder\n                end if\n            end repeat\n\n        end tell\n    end perform mail action with messages\nend using terms from\n\nNote that of course you could easily use a do shell script statement here to use whatever command line tool you want to compare the subject with a regexp, like if (do shell script \"*your regexp that returns 'true' if matched*\" ) is true … and so on. \n\nA: You might try MailActOn. I have not personally tried it, but it has been recommended to me (For the record, the price tag is what stopped me from trying it out). From what I've heard/read, this plugin for Apple Mail might provide you the extra depth you are looking for in managing rules.\nThere might even be competitors out there as well. But this is the only one I have heard about.\nGood luck!\nUpdate: This part of the functionality was what I was referring to. The ability to combine multiple rules (albeit, via key-stroke)\n\nHowever, you are right. This is probably not what the OP was looking for. This is what happens when you recommend products that you haven't tried :)\n\nA: There is a mail filter rules system called 'sieve' which allows you to go as crazy as you want. Usually this is implemented on the mail server side, and either configured there, or from the mail client using a plugin. While technically not a correct answer, this would be your best bet.\nAn Apple Mail for OSX plugin exists called SpamSieve which is as the name suggests targeted at filtering mail for spam, but it can be used for mail sorting and organisation just fine.\n", "Q: Keyboard failure, possibly software fault I've got a MacBook Pro (17\", 2010 model), and recently I've been having a few issues with the keyboard.  Frequently, some keys on the keyboard fail to respond.  These are mainly on the right-hand side of the keyboard (P, O, ;, return, F11, plus others).  An external keyboard does not have any issues.\nAt first I thought it may be a hardware issue, but (a) there seems to be no issue when I boot into Windows 7 (Bootcamp), and (b) I can temporarily fix the problem by pressing F12 (Volume Up).\nDoes anybody have any ideas of what to try?  I could reinstall OSX, but that seems drastic at this stage.  It's still under warranty, but since I need the machine for work, I don't really want to send it in for repair until I've tried everything else.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I would try a Genius Bar at a local mac store if you are located near one. I have seen them fix some weird s/w issues right there.\n\nA: That remind me of a problem MacBook had a few years back. But that was solved through a software update.\nAre you updated to the latest version?\nAlso, can you tell us any (background) app that is running on your computer?\n\nA: I had these problem for 9 months now, some keys won't work, TAB, space, Down Arrow... while external keyboards always work, both USB and Bluetooth.\nSo I presed F12 key and the problem solved I Don't know if will last long, but the fix happened instantly after F12.\n\nA: Ended up taking it in to the Genius Bar.  They suggest reinstalling Mac OSX, which I did, but the problem was back within half an hour.  Took it back and they replaced the Logic board and the Top Cover (including the keyboard). Not sure which it was, but the problem's gone now.\n", "Q: Can a standalone JDK 1.5 run on Snow Leopard? There's a bug in JDK1.6 in Snow Leopard that's affecting Netbeans. I could solve this issue by using JDK1.5, but I noticed that /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5 links to JDK1.6.\nIs there a true JDK 1.5 for Snow Leopard that can be downloaded and installed rather than just one that points to the newer JDK 1.6?\n\nA: You can successfully add a true 1.5 version by following the instructions here:\nInstalling Java 1.5 on Snow Leopard\nI'm not guessing about this. I've actually employed this technique for some of my tech support clients.\n\nA: Question is a bit old, but may still be relevant to some. \nI have just succesfully installed JDK1.5 on Mountain Lion by using this script. The nitty gritty details of the script are outlined at http://www.s-seven.net/java_15_mountain_lion.\nThis makes JDK1.5 available at /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.5.0/Contents/Home.\n\nA: According to this Technical note: TN2110, J2SE 5.0 (which is synonymous with JDK 1.5) is only available with releases for 10.4 and 10.5 (see table 3 about three-quarters of the way down the document). On Apple's Developer site, you can still download Java packages from the past (note: you will need a developer or iTunes or apple account to see this page).\nI have not tried to install an older Java install from Apple, so I am unsure if any of these installs will give you a JDK 1.5 that is \"unlinked\" from JDK 1.6 or if these old installs will place nice together or just replace. In your Utilities folder there is an application called Java Preferences. If you launch that, you can see all the Java runtimes that you have installed already. Before you try downloading past Java installs, perhaps you can use that tool to see if you have a more complete JDK 1.5 installed.\nSorry I cannot give you a more concrete answers, but I wanted to at least give you some leads to try.\nAlso, have you tried checking the various support forums available for Netbeans? Perhaps another Netbean Mac OS X Snow Leopard user has already found and published the answer...\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Drag and drop items as attachment in Entourage I find it little tedious to drop items in new email and make it an attachment. I need to resize both, source and destination window, so that I can pick and drop the item. This takes time. Yes few seconds more, but it matters.\nIs it possible to drag an item from source window and then press command+~ (or command+tab) to chose a destination window and then drop it there? Any other easier solution available?\n\nA: For most Macintosh applications that accept drag and drop, you can drag and drop files to their Dock icon. So your \"flow\" might be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the finder window with the file you want to send\n\n*Drag it to your dock\n\n*Drop it on the Entourage icon\n\n*Entourage will launch and should give you a new message, with that file attached\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You can also begin your drag in the Finder (or your source), trigger Exposé, then drag the file onto the (shrunken) destination window. The window will flash a few times, and then Exposé will close with the destination window frontmost so you can drop your file.\n", "Q: Is there a way to limit the size of the Trash?  I just ran out of disk space and I have like 15GB in my trash. Is there a way to not keep items older than say 7 days or limit the size of the Trash? \nI need a way to automatically keep this managed.\n\nA: Hazel can be configured to both keep files only for a certain amount of time and to keep the trash under a certain size. You could also add custom rules for deleting large files immediately or deleting files in the trash folders of other volumes.\n\n\nA: The Trash is just a special folder (directory) that Apple creates and manages via the Finder so that you have some ability to easily \"undelete\" items (by removing them from the Trash) before you full-on delete (Empty Trash). Since this mechanism is just a directory on your startup disk, you technically have your entire startup disk's space to use up for Trash if you wanted to.\nIf you wanted some measure of \"auto-magical\" removal files older than 7 days, you can use a simple bash script:\nfind ~/.Trash -mtime +7 -exec /bin/rm -rf {} \\;\n\nUsing your favorite text editor, paste the above line into a new file and then save the file as empty_trash_older_than_7_days.sh. In the terminal, be sure to use the chmod command to make it executable as such: chmod +x /path/to/empty_trash_older_than_7_days.sh\nThis command, when executed in the terminal, will find all the files in your Trash (files from your Startup volume only --more on this in a minute) that are older than 7 days (from the time you run this command) and pass each file to the rm -rf command. Since rm is a unix command and has no notion of the Trash, it just does a unix delete which for our purposes is real delete (like Emptying the Trash).\nYou could then use cron (if you are unfamiliar with Cron, check out the fine Cron entry on wikipedia) to setup a recurring execution of this script.\nPersonally, my vote is to just train yourself to use the Empty Trash menu item every few minutes, days, weeks?\nP.S. if all this unix-ese is too frightening, I'd wager there are simple Mac Applications that people have written to do just this sort of thing. Hopefully someone with some knowledge of one ore more of these types of applications can offer up an answer or two as a counter balance.\nGood luck!\nP.S. I forgot to talk about the non-startup volume... If you delete a file from a volume OTHER than your startup volume, this file will go to the .Trash folder on that volume. For example, if you had a volume named Foo, there would be a .Trash folder at /Volumes/Foo/.Trash. What I have documented above will not delete those files. You'd have to setup something similar for each volume you have.\n\nA: John Wiegley's dirscan, in particular the cleanup.py example, is designed to deal with the issues identified with the approaches using find. dirscan provides a more general purpose solution in that you can set it up to scan/clean up different directories in different ways.\n", "Q: Permanently swapping option and command keys on a non-Apple keyboard Whenever I plug my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard into my MacBook Pro, I have to swap the Command and Option modifier keys.  How can I prevent these keys from reverting to their default settings whenever I unplug the keyboard?\n\nA: I assume you already know about the Keyboard Pref Pane. I had exactly the same problem with an Ergonomic and an Arc. The settings didn't stick with external keyboards.\nInstall KeyRemap4MacBook. It works for any Mac, btw. It remaps keys on all keyboards of a Mac - try to use Enter as Right-Cmd, e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Cmd to Alt etc. for all keyboards in KeyRemap4MacBook (both right and left). \n\n*Switch the keys in the Keyboard Pref Pane for the internal keyboard.\nEt voilà!\n\n\nI figured out that weird hack some time ago.

Grab KR4MB here: http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/ - No need to worry about it not getting updated as the dev is super responsive and is constantly tinkering with the app making it better with every release. Another note is that it's open source so if you know your way around you can make changes yourself but I doubt you will need to. It's great software, I have been using it for years and on a wide variety of keyboards with no problems that could not be easily amended by reading the prepared docs. Give it a try, if you use Safari check out his extension \"keystroke.\" I wouldn't be able to use safari without it.\n\nA: KeyRemap4MacBook is now Karabiner (currently 10.6.0); still available at the links above, and also https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\nNever used it before, so I can't speak to what changed with the name.  It's consistent with the previous descriptions; I used the settings exactly as described in TitaniumDecoy's answer, then also mapped the Application key to Fn.  Suddenly, my ancient KeyTronic LT Designer is much more OSX-friendly.\nThere are lots of options, so I can understand the frustration with configuring it.  On the other hand, there are lots of options.  Maps can depend on which application you're running, and there are a lot of preconfigured settings that take advantage of that feature.\nThe only thing I'd like to see added is to have different maps for different keyboards, automatically and simultaneously.  You can disable mapping on Apple keyboards, and/or integral keyboards.  But I can't swap CapsLock for Ctrl everywhere (yup, I <3 Emacs), while swapping Option and Command on only the PC-101 keyboard.  However, you can create several profiles, and switch between them easily, so that's a 90% solution.\nJoe Bob says \"If you're suffering with a Windows keyboard, check it out.\"\n", "Q: How can I open a text file with TextWrangler from the Terminal (command line)? Often when I work in the Terminal (the command line) I need to edit some text files. I prefer to edit text files using TextWrangler.\nHow can I open a text file with TextWrangler from the Terminal?\nI tried with /Applications/TextWrangler.app/ my_text_file.txt but it doesn't work since TextWrangler.app/ is a directory.\n\nA: As a one-time thing,\nopen -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app myfile.txt\nopen -b com.barebones.textwrangler myfile.txt # same thing by ID\n\nYou can also create an alias for opening TextWrangler, that you would put on the .bash_profile file, which is an hidden file by default that is usually in your home directory. \nThis is the command that you could insert:\n# Type 'tw' on the terminal to open TextWrangler\nalias tw='open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app'\n\nTo make TextWrangler the default:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Get Info\" on a text file in the Finder.\n\n*Change the \"Open with:\" program to TextWrangler, in the fifth information pane.\n\n*Click the \"Change All...\" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\n\nA: If you have the TextWrangler command line tools installed, you can just type\nedit my_text_file.txt\n\nin the terminal and it should open. \nIf this doesn't work you have to install the TextWrangler command line tools. \nIf you installed the MacApp store version, download the installer from this page:  http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/cmd-line-tools.html\nIf you downloaded from the BareBones Software site, there should be an \"install command line tools\" command in either the Application (TextWrangler) menu or the help menu. I think it's in the Text Wrangler menu. \n\nA: If you have the TextWrangler command line tools installed you can use 'edit' to open files in TextWrangler from the command line. You should have been prompted at the initial install to install the tools, or you can go to the preferences and the \"Tools\" section and click the installer button. It also gives you twdiff, a TextWrangler-based diff tool. You can 'man edit' if the tools are installed to see all the switches available.\n\nA: IMO, using open is the correct approach. However it requires a bit of typing, so you may want to consider creating a shell alias for it. This approach is also good if you don't want to change your default editors.\n$ alias tw='open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app'\n$ tw myfile.txt\n\nTo have the alias available in every shell you open, just add the line to .bashrc in your home directory. If you don't have a .bashrc yet, just create it yourself and add the line. Then open a new terminal tab to try it out.\n\nA: Another way to edit the text file:\n/Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS/TextWrangler my_text_file.txt\n\nNot all applications contain a binary in the MacOS directory the same name as their .app though, so replicating this for another program might be different.\n", "Q: How does finder show a pc computer name but I can't ping it? I have a MBP running 10.6.  This is my first mac.\nIn finder, it sees the windows 7 machines and windows home server just find.  I can click on those computers and see their shares.  If I open up terminal and try to ping the computer name, it doesn't resolve.  I have had to add the computers to the host file.  I don't understand why finder appears to associate the name with the correct server from the terminal doesn't.  Can somebody explain it or explain how I can get the same behavior from terminal?\n\nA: If a machine is found via Bonjour/multicast DNS, you may need to add a .local suffix to use the hostname in Terminal.  If it was found via NetBIOS (either broadcast or WINS), you may need to use nmblookup to get an IP address:\nrushlight:10120 Z$ nmblookup mress\nquerying mress on 10.0.204.255\n10.0.204.14 mress<00>\n10.0.204.14 mress<00>\n\n\nA: ping on Mac OS X uses basic host lookup via DNS or Bonjour, but your Windows machines are (most likely) being advertised on your network by NetBIOS which ping doesn't consult.\n\nA: If the ping can't resolve the host, then it's a DNS issue; your computer doesn't have a way to translate the computer name into an IP address.\nWhen Finder looks for computers to share files with, it probably sends a packet to what's called a \"multicast\" address, which just means it goes to all devices on the network/subnet.  It'll say something to the effect of \"Hey, do you want to share files?\"  Any computers with file sharing enabled will respond.  This can also be accomplished through Bonjour.\nAs far as how to get Terminal to do the same thing, I don't think you can link it with Finder's list of file-sharing partners.  When given a computer name, ping will need an IP to send its request to, and that has to come from either DNS or your hosts file.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade my mbp internal hard drive (160 gb) with a 64 gb SSD? \nPossible Duplicates:\nDoes the use of SSD give one a dramatic performance boost?\nReplace MacBook Pro hard disk with SSD\n\nShould I upgrade my mbp internal hard drive (160 gb) with a 64 gb SSD?

The performance improvement will be very noticeable.\n", "Q: Why use the terminal in daily non-programming life Disclaimer: I'm a Windows boy awaiting his first mac. I never bothered learning/using command-line interfaces.\nI've been looking at the Terminal Tips and Tricks topic and I don't see how any of those commands would be faster than using the GUI.\nFor example, someone explained how to search with spotlight, using the terminal. How is this better than just using spotlight?\nCould you guys give some real-life examples of situations where you really benefited from your terminal knowledge ?\n\nA: Many people coming over to Mac OS X come from a Unix-ish environment and prefer terminals, so for them there are command line interfaces to many things. If you prefer to stick with the GUI, no problem.\n\nA: Aside for development-related purposes, the command line is an excellent tool for automating actions, scripting, and a host of other things that are probably faster than doing them in say, the Finder.\nFor instance, sometimes I'll be in a folder and want to remove a certain set of files (say, Hello-1.jpg, Hello-2.jpg, Hello-3.jpg, and so on). In the Finder, I'd have to manually select all these files (my Finder is normally set to icon view, so it's a pain to select many files), then move to the trash (granted, I do use the shortcut), and then empty the trash (again, shortcut). For some people, this is convenient enough, but when you get used to using the Terminal, you find that simply typing rm Hello-* is a much faster way to do it.\nOf course, this is only one example (a complicated process like moving files to a server or batch resizing photos will gain even more from using the Terminal), but the more you'll look into the topic, the more useful you'll find it. If you're willing to adopt using the Terminal, there's really no reason not to (you'll get slightly less productive in the beginning, but you'll get much better fast).\n\nA: The command line often has more (and different) options than the GUI tools.  Apple's done a good job of giving you the capabilities and tools a normal user needs in the GUI.  If you want to do unusual things, it's often missing capabilities you need; for example, I do a lot of sysadmin type work, and often need the additional options that shell commands give.\nHere's a specific example: if I need to move someone else's files to a different disk, I want to keep them as the file owner.  If I use the Finder, I'm going to wind up owning the copied files; if I use sudo cp -Rp, it preserves ownership and permissions.\nAnother example: not all preference settings are available in the GUI, but the defaults command can set anything that's stored in the Apple-standard plist format preference file.\nMind you, there are plenty of things that're easy to do in the GUI, but hard/impossible in the terminal.  If you want all of the capabilities of OS X available to you, you need to be fluent in both GUI and terminal.\n\nA: Personally, I don't think using the command line for searching is better than Spotlight. As with most of these, they are personal preferences. One thing I like to do in the Terminal is when I have a large directory of stuff to delete and I just don't want to deal with the two-step Move to Trash and Empty Trash, I will just use the Terminal to rm the files. \nAs it happens, I am a developer and I end up using the Terminal quite often in that context. But truthfully, you can very easily use a Macintosh without ever opening a Terminal window. A large potion of my extended family is in this group and they do quite a lot with their Macintosh computers.\n\nA: Some things are just a bit easier to do from the command line.  For example, lets say I wanted to find every mp3 on my system, and copy it to /Volumes/MyMP3s  unixish way of doing this  (works well, takes a while)\nfind / -name \"*.mp3\" -exec cp {} /Volumes/MyMP3s \\;\nWorks great.  15 seconds of typing vs. quite some time hunting and clicking.\nWhy would you want to use spotlight from the command line?  It can make operations like the above faster.  Since spotlight is using an optimized database (rather than scanning inodes) it will be faster to find the list of mp3s on your system.  You can then do something like this  (pseudo code, not tested)\nforeach file `mdfind -name mp3`; do\n    cp $file /Volumes/MyMP3s\ndone;\n\n\nA: For many typical tasks, the command line is merely an alternative for people who prefer typing to pointing and clicking.\nUsing the command line is also a good way to learn what commands can go into scripts containing long sequences of things to do automatically, which one can then start without having to spend a lot of time repeatedly clicking around for all the individual actions.\n", "Q: Optimizing system for installed software What does it actually do when showing this message on the end of a installation?\n\nA: During the \"optimizing\" stage, the system is \"prebinding\" executables. As per Wikipedia:\n\nPrebinding is a method for reducing the time it takes to launch executables in the Mach-O file format.\nPrebinding looks up memory addresses of symbols in libraries that the program is using before the program is launched, and stores this information ahead-of-time, so that the computer need not look up (bind) addresses on each launch.\n\n", "Q: Clearing contents of my iPad I would like to back up and clear the contents of my iPad before I sell it off and buy an iPad 2.\nWhat is the best way to do this?\n\nA: You can remove all settings and information from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch using \"Erase All Content and Settings\" in Settings > General > Reset.\nFrom Apple's site.\nedit:sorens is correct.

They appear to be just .icns packed in the resource fork  (%file  returns empty, and %cat  prints nothing, which is fine, I understand why).  My understanding is the way to use these was:  \n\n\n*\n\n*open the icon file info (cmd-i) \n\n*select the icon in the upper left, copy it (cmd-c) \n\n*select the drive you want to change pull up info (cmd-i) \n\n*paste icon on top of icon on drive\n\n\nMakes sense to me.  Doesn't work.  Checked from shell, .VolumeIcon.icns doesn't exist on the drive.  Any thoughts?  I feel dumb, I've done this before, can't make it work now.  (10.6.6)\n\nA: Did you click on the icon to select it before pasting?  I found I needed to do that or it would ignore my paste.\n\nA: sigh figured it out.  Should have tried this first.  I needed to give myself write permissions to the drives.  Just added my account as read-write to the drive itself from the info pane.  Everything worked after that.\n\nA: For anyone coming to this page for help with changing the icons of applications, it might be helpful to know that a similar solution is needed.  \nSelect the Application you wish to change the icon of, press cmd i, and look at the bottom of the window.

Don't forget to change the permissions back to read only for \"everyone\" when you're finished.\n\nA: Check to make sure you downloaded the correct version. I just went to interfacelift.com, selected an icon set, chose Mac OS X download. The icon set downloaded and unpacked as folder with the icons as folders.

It works extremely well\nAlso, I think I have used the CD drive in my desktop about twice in two years, so I don't really need one, particularly in a laptop.\nWhat I would Ideally like to do is simply replace the CD drive with a big HD, and use a SSD for the OS.\nIs this possible? I can make up a custom bracket to hold the SSD in the CD-drive enclosure. However, I do not know what kind of interface the CD drive uses.\n\nA: System Profiler is an application that will show you hardware information to determine which bus the CD drive is connected. Once you know your hardware specifications, you can shop better. \nCheck MCE optibay and OWC Data Doubler for housings that work physically with SATA connectors. Also check Remiel's article on the issues you might face moving to an SSD / HD combination.\n\nA: Other World Computing offers the Data Doubler bracket ($75) that allows you to do this. It allows you to replace the optical drive with a second drive, either a hard drive or an SSD (Solid State Drive). The internal optical drive uses a SATA interface. They offer various bundles with combinations of hard drives/SSDs, or you can simply get the bracket kit and supply your own drives.\n\nA: Here is a good How-To Guide from Stammy http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-apple-macbook-pro-raid-0-array-with-2-intel-x25-m-ssds he describes how he had done the job with two Intel X25-M SSDs \nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Center Window on Screen I'm creating a few screen casts and wanted to exactly center my windows in my screen. Any good way to do this on the Mac? I found an Apple Script example (and a few linked screens) but none of them support centering 'Terminal' vertically (although they do support centering other applications vertically).\n\nA: I enjoy using SizeUp to manage windows, one of which is a center on screen option. Good luck.\n\nA: Not sure if this might do what you are looking for as well, but Divvy is also a neat piece of software for arranging windows. \nI suggest you watch the screencast on their website to see if it does what you are looking for, but basically it has a grid where you can change the size and position of the frontmost window. \nYou can also change the grid it displays to have finer control over the size of the windows you are working with.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Kevin. I’m the author of the post that you linked to on incrementalism.net.\nThe reason the Terminal window moves to the top is just a bug in Terminal’s AppleScript support.\nThis version does the vertical centering and works around the Terminal bug:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set screenSize to bounds of window of desktop\n    set screenWidth to item 3 of screenSize\n    set screenHeight to item 4 of screenSize\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set myFrontMost to name of first item of ¬\n        (processes whose frontmost is true)\nend tell\n\ntry\n    tell application myFrontMost\n        set windowSize to bounds of window 1\n        set windowXl to item 1 of windowSize\n        set windowYt to item 2 of windowSize\n        set windowXr to item 3 of windowSize\n        set windowYb to item 4 of windowSize\n\n        set windowWidth to windowXr - windowXl\n        set windowHeight to windowYb - windowYt\n\n        if myFrontMost is \"Terminal\" then\n            set bounds of window 1 to {¬\n                round ((screenWidth - windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬\n                round ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬\n                round ((screenWidth + windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬\n                round ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2 + windowHeight) rounding as taught in school}\n        else\n            set bounds of window 1 to {¬\n                round ((screenWidth - windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬\n                round ((screenHeight - windowHeight) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬\n                round ((screenWidth + windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬\n                round ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2) rounding as taught in school}\n        end if\n\n        set the result to bounds of window 1\n\n    end tell\nend try\n\nI hope that helps, if you haven’t already paid for one of the other options.

I've used my Time Machine drive to back up my main machine, and also a friend's mac. Her machine is now being backed up on another Time Machine drive, and she'd like me to delete her backup.\nI'm familiar with the (perhaps obscure) way to delete a particular time machine backup, or how to delete all backups of a particular file, but I have no idea how to delete another machine's backup.\nIf I had access to her machine, I'd plug in the drive and delete the entire backup of her drives using time machine on her computer.

Disclaimer: It's kinda hard to search for this question, as Google would give me mostly iOS programming topics.\nI'm planning on buying an iPad2 and I wonder if other programmers have found it to be a practical, and hopefully, better replacement for books.\nDespite the availability of online tutorials I have found the times I have learned best and made the most progress is when I forced myself to sit down and read through manuals, from start to finish.\nI guess the crux of my question is: as a developer, have you been able to use an iPad for reading programming books in a way that it is more convenient than Cmd/Alt-Tabbing between a PDF viewer and other apps on your computer?\nAlso, does the iPad PDF viewer remember the last viewed page of every PDF file? (Like Skim does on Mac OS)\nThanks!\n\nA: I use iBooks on the iPad to read all my development books, and if your doing iOS development you'll even find the Apple development books in eBook format. It's the main purpose I bought my iPad, and it definitely works for that purpose. Since iBooks can import PDF's even my older books I have scanned works.\n\nA: I use GoodReader for reading Apple manuals, synced via Dropbox.\nGR remembers positions in all PDFs I read.\nIt also keeps all my annotations and highlights in sync with PDFs on my Mac.\nOverall, very convenient solution IMHO.\n\nA: Ipad is more convenient than a kindle , ESP for reading programming ebooks.....

I have configured my wireless airport extreme to use client mode (hint: if this is not available in \"manual configuration\", start the assistent and it will appear in the menu ...).\nThis is working fine and I can access APX via my default wireless connection. However, I have a few systems attached to the LAN ports and these are not accessible. \nI read that the APX is disabling the LAN ports in this configuration (why?) - is that true? Someone knows a way to have this configuration running in bridge (or routed mode, I don't care ...) mode?\nThanks a lot\nsven\n\nA: Short Answer\nThis is a security-related limitation of the 802.11 standard. The 802.11n-capable AirPort Express has a fancy feature to work around this limitation, but the AirPort Extremes and Time Capsules do not.  \nLong Answer\nThe IEEE 802.11 standard requires the Access Point (AP) to require each wireless station (STA) to authenticate and \"associate\" to the AP before the AP can process real network traffic from the STA. STAs are identified by their wireless Media Access Controller (MAC) address (a.k.a. \"AirPort ID\", hardware address, etc.).\nSimple network bridge devices don't change the MAC addresses on network frames.  So if the AirPort Extreme tried to simply bridge traffic from the wired Ethernet devices on its LAN ports, those frames would still have those wired devices' source MAC addresses on them, and since those MAC addreses had never authenticated and associated with the AP, the AP would drop those frames for security reasons. Because this mode of joining an AP doesn't allow the Extreme to bridge frames from wired clients on its LAN port, the Extreme disables its LAN port to help users get the hint.\nThe 802.11 spec provides a standard way around this. It's called Wireless Distribution System (WDS). But WDS was under-specified in the 802.11 spec, lacks several important mechanisms, and various vendors' implementations aren't guaranteed to interoperate. So Apple chose to only officially support WDS between Apple AirPort Extreme, Express, and Time Capsule devices. So this isn't a solution for you if your AP is non-Apple. It's possible you could set it up manually and it may happen to work just fine, but Apple won't help you if it doesn't.\nWith the 802.11n-capable Extremes, Expresses, and Time Capsules, Apple provided an Apple-enhanced version of WDS that they just call \"Extend the network\", to provide the needed protocol mechanisms that bog-standard 802.11 WDS lacks. But again, no third party devices do this, so it's just and Apple-to-Apple thing.\nThe 802.11n-capable AirPort Express (note: not Extreme, just Express) has one special advantage here. It can do something an 802.11 engineer might call \"Proxy STA\" mode, where it not only joins a third-party AP was a STA, but it also spoofs the MAC addresses of all the wired Ethernet devices out its LAN port and performs 802.11 authentication and association as a proxy for those wired Ethernet devices, which allows the Express to bridge frames from those clients without the AP dropping them for security reasons. To the AP, all those MAC addresses looks like separate wireless clients; it has no idea that the Express is actually proxying for them all.\n", "Q: Best, or best supported, USB-Serial adaptor for OSX I have various devices to connect to my iMac using good-old RS-232.\nOf course, I only have USB connectors on my machine.\nI have a couple of Prolific PL2303-based cables, and they seem to work OK, but the kext provided seems a little flaky and I'm not sure about long-term support.\nWhat is the most-stable, best-supported USB-Serial chip-set or cable?\n\nA: I have two Prolific USB-to-serial adapters but they are made by different Vendors (one is Prolific, the other ATEN).\nI've used their supplied drivers just fine. Note that there are open source drivers for these devices too available here: https://github.com/failberg/osx-pl2303 FYI my use case is actually patching them through to a VirtualBox Windows VM and using them in Windows, so I have two layers of drivers and have not had any problems yet.\nHowever, I think the best supported USB-to-serial devices are those made by Belkin. This is subjective, but I've used them for years without problem, and they are a large company with a reputation. They will likely be around in the future.\n\nA: Just to be clear, I have not used this device myself.\nStewart Cheshire, creator of ZeroConf (the basis of Bonjour), gave a Google Tech Talk on the subject of ZeroConf, and presented a couple of embedded devices (Cameras, and an RS-232 unit).\nI've always wanted to try this out, but have never had a good enough use to cough up the money to do so.\nStewart presented an RS-232 over Ethernet module from SitePlayer. They have a built in web interface used to set up the ethernet and serial parameters, and if I understand correctly, you simply telnet to the device's IP address in order to be presented with the serial interface. (See their pdf on the subject.)\n\nA: I'm professionaly using a\nRoline USB to Serial 0.3 m long adapter.\nI'm using the PL2303 OSX driver.\nWhen I plug my cable, this driver dynamically create /dev/tty.PL2303-0000nnnn. I use it from a Terminal or xterm window with:\nscreen /dev/tty.PL2303-0000nnnn.\n0 problem with hundreds of connections on network equipments and servers (Brocade, Cisco, Extreme, Oracle (ex. Sun)…).\n\nA: Both Prolific PL2303 and FTDI devices work fine.\nI'm using a TrendNET TU-S9 v2 currently (PL-2303). Other than the vendor provided driver or driver from Prolific's Taiwan website, options include https://www.mac-usb-serial.com (fairly inexpensive driver), and the nice Mac app https://www.decisivetactics.com/products/serial/ (not free but works well) which has built-in drivers and doesn't require a separate driver installation.\nI have also seen claims that FTDI drivers are built into MacOS now but haven't personally tested since I don't have a FTDI device.\nOne thing to be aware of - to connect to PC's and certain PC-like devices with serial ports (some routers/firewalls etc) you need a null modem adaptor or null modem cable between your USB-serial device and the PC/device you're connecting to, usually with female-female connectors.\n", "Q: How do I find my CPU's temperature?

My girlfriend says she dragged the USB disk from the sidebar in finder into trash and  I have since emptied the trash.\nIs this plausible? How do I show/display a USB drive using the command line or finder?\n\nA: Following up @mankoff's answer, I understand she dragged the USB from the Finder's sidebar, which means she actually removed the Volume's icon from the bar, causing the puff's effect. In order to restore the icon, you can't just simply unplug-replug the removed volume, you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the USB Drive again.\n\n*Open Finder's Preferences and check/uncheck the corresponding's option (that will refresh the sidebar and the drive will reappear)\n\n*Profit…\nHere's an easier way to see it:\n\nThat'll refresh the sidebar and devices will reappear. \n\nA: Dragging a drive into the trash just means \"eject\", not \"delete contents\". Since USB can't be physically ejected, it just unmounts it. Emptying the trash has no effect in this case.\nUnplug it, wait a few seconds, plug it back in, and it should show up.\nIf you don't want to unlpug and plug it back in, see hdiutil attach for CLI solutions, or /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app for GUI.\n", "Q: Disable special function keys on Apple Wireless Keyboard when connected to iPad I'm currently using an Apple Wireless Keyboard connected via Bluetooth to my iPad.

Is there anyway to disable the function keys without turning off the entire keyboard?\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to manage the function keys connected to an iPad. Your better options would be to shut off bluetooth when you stop using your iPad (which is better for battery life too!), or shut off the keyboard itself.\n\nA: Same problem. similar, but quicker and easier solution: going into system preferences to turn off (and later turn back on bluetooth) takes too long.\nSimply hold the keyboard's power button long enough to actually turn the keyboard off (not just put it to sleep).

I tried to pipe the output from leave to say by typing the following in terminal, but it didn't work.\nleave +5 | say\n\nWhat is the correct way to do this?\n\nA: Based on mankoff's answer, this works:\nleave +1 2>&1 | while read line ; do echo $line | say ; done\n\nalthough leave no longer vanishes into the background and lets you carry on typing. Similarly:\nleave +1 2>&1 | while read line ; do echo $line | say ; done &\n\nwill make it vanish into the background, but will also speak a (harmless) process ID number as well. So neither is quite perfect, but both work.\n(I was looking for a solution to:\nping google.com | say\n\nwhich suffers a similar problem, and someone suggested the above as a solution. I didn't add this as a comment to mankoff's answer because I can't work out how to put spaces and newlines in comments.).\n\nA: Your example is, in general, the correct way to pipe normal output to say:\n cat file | say\n echo \"hello world\" | say\n\nThe specific issue is that the | (pipe) character transfers STDOUT from the command on the left to STDIN to the command on the right. say then speaks whatever is on STDIN.\nHowever, leave does not print the output directly to STDOUT. It is either using STDERR, or some other message mechanism. You can pipe STDERR through the |, but the syntax is shell dependent. For bash, you would do it like so, although I'm not sure that this will make leave work with say, as I don't much about leave.\ncmd 2>&1 |cmd2\n\n\nA: As an addition to this - if you want to pipe an ongoing file to say, the \"recipe\" also works with tail:\ntail -f ~/Documents/activity.log | while read line ; do echo $line | say ; done\n\n\nA: I think you simply can´t use leave for that, rather use sleep with the correct amount of seconds (put it into a short script to convert seconds to minutes, hours):\nsleep 60 && say -v Vicki 'Time to leave!' &\n\n", "Q: Clear thumbnails for renamed files I ran a batch of images through an AppleScript Finder script that replaced text substrings in the filenames and did so once more to change the extensions to something other than .jpeg. As expected, some of the images, lost their thumbnails, but others didn't and when I CMD+i to view info for these, they still show up as JPEG image files to be opened in Preview.app, even though they are now .info files.\nAny subsequent attempts to rename them or change their extension fails to remove their thumbnail or JPEG association.\nWhy is this? And how can clear the thumbnails?\n\nA: \nAny subsequent attempts to rename them\n  or change their extension fails to\n  remove their thumbnail or JPEG\n  association.\nWhy is this? And how can clear the\n  thumbnails?\n\nThese image files might have the thumbnails saved as resource-fork-based custom icon resources.\nImages saved from apps like Photoshop, Graphic Converter, etc. will sometimes generate a thumbnail that becomes part of the file. For example, here's a look at an image file in an app that shows the different fork sizes:\n\nWhile the data fork is less than 4 KB, the resource fork is 44 KB.\nInside the resource fork is all kinds of stuff, like:\n\nand then the custom icon resource:\n\nWhile image apps can do this, you can also give a file or folder a custom icon by opening a Get Info window for different files, and copy and paste the icon from one file to another.\n[EDIT] NOTE: See the AppleScript that I mention below, which will do everything you need. I'll leave the following step by step instructions FWIW.\nSo, you may be able to clear the custom icons by using the following method:\n1) Open up the Finder's Inspector window by pressing Command-Option-i (the Inspector is basically a dynamic Get Info window).\n2) In a Finder window, select the files that still have their thumbnail icon.\n3) In the Inspector panel, click on the icon of the documents, as shown in the image below:\n\n(The icon will have a blue outline when selected).\n4) Press the delete key to delete the custom icons.\n————————————\nRegarding the following comment you posted above:\n\n\"I was merely renaming the extensions\n  so the thumbnails would not show. Now\n  they are all of the form \"123.info\",\n  but some still show thumbnails and\n  even open as if they were still .jpeg\n  files.\"\n\nWhat's most likely happening here is that the files were saved in an application that set a file type of 'JPEG'. In Mac OS X, Launch Services uses a combination of the file's filename extension (if any) along with its file type (if any) to determine what type of content the file represents. \"info\" isn't a normal filename extension that's built-in to the OS, so if there's no application on your Mac that claims that filename extension, then the Finder (Launch Services, really) will regard the file as a JPEG image.\nI created a combination AppleScript that will both clear any file type and creator code information, as well as delete the resource fork. (Contrary to common belief, file type and creator codes aren't stored in the resource fork, but in the disk directory information (FSCatalogInfo), so deleting only the resource fork isn't sufficient. Also, when a file has a custom icon, there is also a flag that is set in the FSCatalogInfo to that effect. This flag needs to be cleared in addition to deleting the resource fork).\nClearCustomIconFileTypeAndCreatorCode.zip \nDrop a selection of files onto it to have the custom icon, file type, and creator codes cleared.\nThe contents of the script are as follows:\non open droppedItems\n    repeat with i from 1 to count of droppedItems\n        set droppedItem to item i of droppedItems as alias\n        set droppedItemInfo to info for droppedItem\n        if (folder of droppedItemInfo) is false then\n            do shell script \"/usr/bin/xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo \" & quoted form of POSIX path of droppedItem\n            do shell script \"/usr/bin/xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork \" & quoted form of POSIX path of droppedItem\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend open\n\n\nA: In the general unix world, files don't need extensions to function. This is why binaries are extension-less. Instead, extensions are used for clarification/organization purposes, which is more intended for the user than anything else.\nIf you change a filename or an extensions, you haven't changed anything about the file. If OSX already has the thumbnails cached for the file, it already knows it's a JPEG file, and renaming them may not change anything about it.\nI don't know the entire answer to your question, because I couldn't explain why some files are JPEG image files and some aren't. I suspect it has something do with files that have their extension versus files that don't.\nTwo things to pay attention to:\n(1) You can globally enable all extensions via Finder Preferences.\n\n(2) Pay attention to the \"Hide Extension\" property in the File Info Dialog:\n\nIf you're interested in more details on this subject, you can read up on the .DS_Store files page, if you've ever seen them before, and the Extended File Attributes page on Wikipedia.\n", "Q: How to fix gray files in Finder? Is there any way to force Finder to refresh its in-use information for gray (inaccessible) files?\nDetails:  \nI move infrequently used files from my Mac (OS X 10.6) to a Windows Server 2008 file server.  I have recently found a large number of files which OS X's Finder shows as gray (like it would if the file was in the process of being copied).  The files in question are all valid and complete: no corruption or missing data; in fact, I can access the files from Terminal or from a Windows computer without problem, but Finder still thinks they should be considered inaccessible.\nI can \"fix\" the problem by copying the original file to a new name, deleting the original file, waiting a minutes or so, and then renaming the new file to the original name (if I don't wait long enough, the new file will become gray when it is renamed to the original name).\nBasically, it seems as if the Finder has failed to clear some \"in-use\" or \"incomplete\" flag [conjecture].\nSo, back to the original question: how can this be fixed?  Ideally, I would like to be able to scan the network drives and find and fix all the gray files via Terminal or Recursive operation, so I can fix them all without wasting a lot of time.\n\nA: This solved it for me!  http://macadmins.psu.edu/news/2011/06/grayed_out_finder_folder \n\nSo, what happened? It appears that the folder's creation date was set\n  to a random date in 1943.  While we are unsure of how it happened, we\n  did figure out how to fix it. \nWe used a few binaries that came with the Developer Tools, GetFileInfo\n  and SetFile. GetFileInfo showed us the creation date of the folder. We\n  overlooked it at first, but with closer examination it caught our eye.\n$ GetFileInfo Test/ directory: \"/Users/user/Desktop/Test\" attributes:\n  avbstclinmedz created: 06/13/1943 06:13:00 modified: 06/13/2011\n  15:07:33\nWe then could change the creation date using the SetFile tool.\n$ SetFile -d 06/13/2011 Test/\nAfter seting the date back to a reasonable time, we can see that it\n  has truly changed.\n$ GetFileInfo Test/ directory: \"/Users/userid/Desktop/Test\"\n  attributes: avbstclinmedz created: 06/13/2011 06:13:00 modified:\n  06/13/2011 15:07:33\nThe folder then showed properly in the Finder and was again usable. We\n  also found that if you created an alias of the folder, you could see\n  the data and move it out. Once it was moved out into another folder,\n  the old folder could be deleted.\n\n\nA: I solved this by using the duplicate command on the grayed out folder. The new folder will be accessible and the files can be moved to another folder. After moving the files, delete both folders (gray and copy), now both empty\n\nA: Use ls -la to check if the file has extended properties. That will look similar to:\n-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 user1  staff  439734882 Aug 16 21:34 myfile.zip\nLook at the @  at the end. That stands for extended properties.\nTo view the extended properties, you'll need to use xattr -l filename command. \nIn many cases, the greyed out files have com.apple.FinderInfo attribute, that looks like:\ncom.apple.FinderInfo:\n00000000  62 72 6F 6B 4D 41 43 53 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |brokMACS........|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020\n\nTo remove that attribute, run xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo filename, and the file will get back to normal.\nIf you need to remove that attribute from all files recursively, you can run: \nxattr -dr com.apple.FinderInfo .\nDon't miss the dot . at the end that means the current directory.\nOriginal post: https://tangentlin.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/greyed-out-files-in-mac-osx/\n\nA: Try deleting your caches (~/Library/Caches) and restarting.  My experience has been that this usually fixes odd icon-related issues.\n\nA: You can try to rsync the files again by using rsync tool:\n$ rsync -aut /source/* /destination\n\nor (if there are too many files):\n$ find /source/ -name \\* -type f -exec rsync -at {} /destination/ \";\"\n\nHere are the arguments for BSD rsync:\n-a, --archive               archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)\n-u, --update                skip files that are newer on the receiver\n-t, --times                 preserve modification times\n\nIf you're using GNU rsync, consider adding:\n-N, --crtimes               preserve create times (newness)\n\nNote: You can install GNU rsync by brew install rsync.\nIf this won't help, also try without -u.\n\nA: Eureka!  I figured out what is causing the problem.\nThe files are being copied to a Windows Server 2008 network share with DFS replication (to another server).  Somehow, Finder is caching the \"busy\" status of the file; and this sometimes occurs while the file is being replicated.\nThe work-around is to use terminal to duplicate the file, delete the original, WAIT!!!, and then rename the duplicate to the original name.  (If you don't wait, the duplicate my become grey when it renamed.)\nThat is the \"what\"; I'm still hoping someone can explain where the information is cached.\nIf anyone can figure out where the information is cached and how to identify which files are affected in a script, I will accept their answer; otherwise, I'll mark this as this answer and write the problem off to OS/X & Windows interoperability weirdness.\n", "Q: How to get MacBook Air to automatically connect to company guest network? My company has a guest wifi network for use by non-company issued machines. Since getting my MacBook Air recently, I've wanted to bring it in and use it around the office. \nI can easily connect to the (unsecured) guest wifi network but then the first time I try to access a website I get a login page where I need to use my company userid/password to gain access. This is kind of like it works in a hotel. \nThis works fine except if I put my machine to sleep and wake it up again, I need to re-login again. This re-login happens all day long. Very annoying. I'm wondering if I can configure my Mac to automatically login for me. Is there a way of configuring the wireless networking on my Mac to automatically pass my userid/password for when upon connecting?\n\nA: If the login functions through a Webpage, it's probable that the closest you could come is to write a script to fill in the form for you.\nIf you're lucky, the login form might use a HTML GET request so you could to bookmark the page that logs you in. Pay attention to what redirects occur once you login. If you see something like this:http://example.com?name=fred&pword=qwerty, you can bookmark that and go to it to log in automatically.\nThis is unlikely, though, because it isn't a very secure choice for your company. The form probably uses a POST request.\n\nA: It is possible to do a POST request using curl from terminal. You need to figure out the key/values pairs that are being passed, and the action url, and then submit to that url.\n", "Q: Will a MacBook7,1's SuperDrive work in a MacBook2,1? A friend of mine has a MacBook2,1 mid 2007 with a dead Combo Drive (long story short, someone at the Apple Store put the wrong drive in), and I have a MacBook7,1 (mid 2010) that I tore down for parts.\nNormally I'd just try this myself but the drive is at my parents house an hour away and gas is $3.49 a gallon. Does anyone know if they're interchangeable?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this isn't possible. The MacBook7,1 has a SATA connection for the optical drive, whereas the MacBook2,1 has an ATA connection for the optical drive.\n\nA: As far as the drive goes, it's a standard ATA DVD drive, however it may have a different case (for the screws/connectors). \nYour best bet (unless someone can come up with the exact answer) is to check iFixit and find the tear down of the models and compare the pictures. I'd say they are, but Macbook internals have changed a lot and you might have to disassemble the whole SuperDrive. \nFor example here's the guide to replace the SuperDrive on the mid-2010 model. \nFind the other model and compare. But remember, the drive itself may be faster/better but it's the same drive you'll find in any other PC, no matter how Super Apple makes it sound ;)\n", "Q: How do I clean out dust in the fans of my MacBook Pro? How do I clean out the dust in the fans of my MacBook Pro? (I'm perfectly comfortable with opening my MacBook Pro up (Unibody 2008 edition with removable battery cover), but I'm not exactly sure how I would carry out the dust-cleaning procedure. \nRecently my lower left part (In typing perspective) of my MacBook Pro had a really odd sound coming from it. I remember seeing a fan on that part and had saw lots of dust on it, but never did anything much about it.\nWould I use my fingers to scrape out the dust in the fans? Or a can of compressed air? (Wouldn't that be counterproductive? I would be blowing all the dust into the MacBook Pro/the unibody case itself/onto the other components on the motherboard?)\nThanks in advance. :)\n\nA: At least, you will be able to have access to your fan without breaking your MacBook Pro. iFixit has a step by step procedure that you can follow to take off the parts of your computer so that you have access to the fans.\nAs far as I'm concerned, I would use a can of compressed air.\n\nA: I used the IFixit guide that OGenius linked to. I had a small piece of paper stuck. I did not actually have to remove the fans, I just opened the laptop, blew a bit and used a vacuum cleaner a bit too.\n", "Q: Can XNA & Visual Studio be run in VMware Fusion on Mac OS X? Is it possible to run XNA & Visual Studio from a machine under VMware Fusion running on Mac OS X?\n\nA: I have done the setup before. You won't get hardware acceleration but the setup does work and if your not doing any work that requires hardware acceleration it should be fine.\nI previously did demos for Tech-Ed on gaming development using this setup without any problems.\nFor hardware acceleration you will need to use Boot Camp.\n", "Q: Will Lion X be downloadable for everyone? I'm new to the Apple world. I was wondering if the update to Lion X will be free for users that has recently bought a new MacBook Pro (like me). If not, how much will it cost?\n\nA: No, the update will not be free (though it is yet unclear what the price will be, possibilities ranging from $29 to $129), and will only be free for those who purchase computers within 2 weeks of the update coming out (this is usually the time window for the free upgrades that Apple offers) in the summer. If you've purchased your computer recently, sorry, but you'll have to pay for it.\n\nA: If you just bought your MacBook Pro, you won't be a recent buyer when Lion comes out (it's going to be a few months at least). \nLion will probably cost $129 like almost all OS X updates. (Two versions were less than that: Snow Leopard [10.6] was $29 and 10.1 [Cheetah, I think] was free if you had 10.0, but I doubt the reasons for those two scenarios are the case now.)\n", "Q: Is there a way to hide all file extensions in OS X? Is there any way to globally hide every single file extension in OS X? I've seen the option in the Get Info menu to hide the selected file's extension, but I'd like to never see a file extension unless I chose to.\n\nA: In the Finder, selected the Preferences menu item from the Finder menu. Click the Advanced Tab. Make sure to un-check Show all filename extensions. Close the window.\n\nI had thought this was unset by default, but perhaps not.\n\nA: The only correct answer is that you should not be doing what you are trying to do.\nHidden file extensions is a serious security hole.  If you allow file extensions to be hidden, someone can create an application and name it:\nMyFile.pdf.app\n\nand on your machine, you will see a file named:\nMyFile.pdf\n\npossibly even with a PDF icon.  Your first thought will not be, \"Why is the extension showing?\" but rather, \"Oh, that's just a PDF file.  It's safe to open it.\"  And that's when your machine becomes a zombie in a botnet.\nYou should always leave the \"Show all filename extensions\" checkbox checked.  It's really the only way to be completely safe from those sorts of trojans.\n\nA: I use Hazel with an applescript to keep my filename extensions hidden.  Hazel is just a way to make sure that anytime I create a new file, the applescript gets run on it.  The applescript is pretty easy -- you can see all three lines of it in the screenshot below.  I also like to set the color labels by file type, thus the selection of only PDFs and the red color labels.  You can skip both of those if you like.\n\nJust to be clear, you don't need to use Hazel.  You could use folder actions or an automator workflow to initiate the applescript on the files you want to change.\n", "Q: Media player that plays .m4v files?

For the past few years, when I have wanted to archive something from the TiVo to my Macintosh, I used iTiVo. However, this application has many issues (crashes, freezes, very, very slow) and has not been updated in almost 2 years. My frustration with its \"quirks\" has prompted me to seek another solution. The only other Macintosh OS X software I have found via google is a Dashboard Widget (ick) called TiVo NowPlaying. This widget (versioned 2.51) has not been updated since Oct 2007. It's usable, but not ideal (slow, sometimes needs to be restarted and doesn't support mpeg4).\nI am using fairly modern Macintosh (intel) computers, updated to the current version of Mac OS X (Snow Leopard).\nWhat are other Macintosh + TiVo owners using to move content from their TiVo to the Macintosh? \nI am hoping someone has some information on something better to use than the options I have listed above.\n\nA: kmttg is a cross-platform Java program that does what you're looking for.  Personally I've used it on Windows without issue to copy shows off my Tivo onto my computer, do a batch convert of the video files, along with batch rename.  It's a very powerful and handy tool for any owner of a Tivo Series 3 or more recent Tivo.   It should run on modern Macs without issue.\nYou can grab it off Google Code here.  The Tivo Community forums have an extremely long-running thread about the tool here.\n", "Q: Where is the Xcode installer located? When I browse the Mac App Store, the buy button of the Xcode app is shown as \"installed\" so that I can't buy it. But I can't find it in my Applications folder either.\nHow can I locate the app? Or how can I change the \"installed\" button to \"buy\" button?\n\nA: FYI, I had a similar problem but eventually noticed (via spotlight search for 'xcode') that rather than installing the actual app, it had downloaded an app in /Applications called, \"Install XCode\" which was 4.58 GB.\nRunning that does the actual install of XCode 4.\n\nA: You could try inspecting the output of\n$ pkgutil --pkgs\n\nto see if any of the names look like the package that claims to be installed, then\n$ pkgutil --pkg-info thatpackage\n\nto see where it was installed.  If it's not actually found there, you could try\n$ sudo pkgutil --forget thatpackage\n\nand see if the App Store will let you re-download; but at that point I'd probably contact App Store support first, as mucking with the package database might cause bigger problems (like, conceivably, forgetting that you ever bought the program — although I would hope Apple's programmers were smarter than that).\n\nA: Did you already have a non-App Store version of the app installed?  When I installed Opera from the App Store, it replaced my existing version of Opera, which I had not installed in Applications.\nYou can locate the app by using Spotlight.  Click the magnifying glass in the top-right corner of your screen and type the name of the application in.  Click \"Show all\", right-click on the application, and select \"Open enclosing folder\".\n", "Q: Why won't wget work with cron?

I am considering getting an iPad 2 because of the support for inputting an electric guitar in via an Apogee JAM device. However, part of my bigger picture is to take an MXL .009 USB Condensor Mic into the Garageband app. But I just read that the iPad 2 does not have a USB port on it.\nIs there a way to take the audio from a MXL .009 USB mic into the iPad 2 similar to the way the Apogee jam works via the dock connection?\n\nA: My concern would be if the MXL USB mic expects to draw electrical power through the USB port. In that case the iPad 2 and the iPad Camera Connector Kit certainly would not provide enough power for the microphone. You should go to the MXL web site and check their support information.\nThe Alesis IO Dock Pro, US$200.00, provides professional-quality audio and MIDI interfaces to the iPad 2, but only interfaces MIDI over USB, not audio over USB like with the MXL microphone you describe. The Alesis is designed to work with conventional condenser microphones with an XLR audio cable, and it provides phantom power.\n\nA: As stated by Wheat Williams, the iPad 2 does not allow much power through the USB port found on iPad Camera Connector Kit (the first iPad had different specs), and even most thumb Flash drives require too much power. A work around that might suit under some recording circumstances is to use an AC powered USB hub, and let the MXL USB mic draw its power from the wall rather than straight from the iPad 2. The requirement of access to an AC source is the obvious drawback, but it does work well. Here's a link to a video about the various uses for iPad Camera Connector Kit. (I did not do the video.)\n\nA: I think I can use an ipad camera connector kit as shown in this video.\n", "Q: Headphones that look good on a desk next to a MacBook I'm looking for some headphones that will be aesthetically (and acoustically) pleasing when combined with my MacBook Pro (2011, aluminum unibody). \nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Over-the-ear style (not earbuds or ear-canal buds) \n\n*Closed design (in order to block out some outside noise and avoid leaking noise.) \n\n*Pretty (I realize this is subjective)\n\n*Great-sounding \n\n*Durable\n\n*Under $400 \n\n*Wireless optional (I'm not sure if there are any great-sounding, great-looking wireless headphones)\n\n\nI'm currently considering:\n\n\n*\n\n*V-Moda Crossfade, ~$175\n\n*Sennheiser RS-160 (wireless), ~$195 \n\n*Bowers & Wilkins P5, ~$300\n\n*Denon AHD2000, ~350\n\n\nNotes:\nThe transmitter for the Sennheisers takes batteries, so there's no extra wire or wall wart, but it is kind of bulky. \nI haven't seen any nice Bluetooth headphones that support A2DP (stereo audio profile for bluetooth). That would be ideal -- no wires, no transmitter required.\nBottom Line:\nIf you have experience with any of the headphones I'm considering, I'd love to hear it. If there are headphones I've overlooked, please let me know!\n\nA: Beats by Dr. Dre SOLO HD\nThey sounds amazing, looks nice and got a clean look. Here is a review.\nPrice: ~229.95 USD.\n\nA: Seriously, I´ve never felt more comfortable then when wearing the AKG K701 (Amazon.com link) headphones, I´ve worn them for 6 hours straight without getting red hot, sweaty ears. They are a piece of beauty (in my perspective) and offer a neutral, nearly analytical soundscape. \nJust have a look at the reviews - they are an immediate buy recommendation!\n\nA: Have you looked at the Bose QuietComfort 15?\nI have been using these headphones for a few years now and they are excellent and very comfortable. With the noise canceling engaged and some quiet music playing, almost all outside noise goes away completely. They are comfortable enough that I can wear them for several hours and feel no discomfort. They cost about $300. The only negative is that in order to play music, you must have the noise canceling feature turned on which requires a battery. So if you happen to be on the road (say, in an airplane) and your battery dies, you are SOL. So definitely make sure you have a spare charged AAA battery nearby.\nAesthetic looks were never that important to me, but from comparing the other products you list, the Bose headset looks very similar so it should satisfy you in that department. \nGood luck with your decision!\n\nA: For casual listening you just can't beat the comfort and sound from a pair of Grado headphones. At your budget the SR325iare a great choice. They are open air so some sound will be heard in the vicinity near you, but they're not that loud to others around you.\nThey happen to look nice as well.\n\nA: I got the following advice from ghoppe:\n\nI bought the B&W P5 when they were on\n  sale on the Apple store and do not\n  regret it. They sound amazing, look\n  amazing, and so far have been very\n  durable. One of my fave tech purchases\n  ever.\n\nBased on that advice, I bought the Bowers & Wilkins P5. They look great, are comfortable, don't leak noise, and passively block out a reasonable amount of background noise.\nWhen I'm not using them, they sit on a Woo Audio Aluminum Headphone Stand.\n", "Q: Is there a performance issue with GNU Screen, Tmux, and other similar development tools on the MacBook Air?

Is it the monitor or the Mac? I just bought an old Mac Mini to start developing for iOS. The Mac Mini has a DVI port, so I connected it to my Dell 24\" display which has a DVI connection. But it appears that my Mac wont boot. I dont even know if it is booting or not because my monitor does not show anything, as it did not get any signal and went to standby mode immediately. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to connect a keyboard and mouse to the Mini in order to boot?\n\n*Even if I don't connect a keyboard and mouse to the Mini, will I still see something on the monitor?

To be clear, my display works fine with my PC.\n\n*I tried with my Microsoft USB keyboard and an IBM USB mouse, but I did not see any difference, i.e. nothing could be seen on the display.\n\n*Does this mean I have to buy a keyboard and mouse from Apple to make it work?\n\n\nCan someone help me and give me some hints? Thanks a lot in advance!\n\nA: The Mac will boot with or without a mouse and keyboard, and you should see something on the monitor either way.\nYou do not need to use Apple mice and keyboards.\nSo, the problem has to be either the monitor or the Mac Mini.\nYou can look at the power light to see if the Mini is running. If it is steady white, the computer is on. If it is pulsing, the computer is sleeping. If it is off, the computer is off.\nIf the computer is on but nothing is coming up on the monitor:\nCheck all connections. Try with a different monitor, if possible. Make sure the correct input is selected on the monitor.\nIf the computer won't turn on:\nCheck all connections. Make sure it's plugged in. Make sure you've pressed the power button all the way, without holding it down too long.\nIf you can't get it to turn on at all, take it back to the people who sold it to you and get your money back; they sold you a broken machine.\n", "Q: How to browse the iBook store without owning an iPad? I am considering purchasing an iPad and one of the uses would be to read books. But I can't find a way to browse the iBook store and see what books they have available without actually owning an iPad. Is it accessible via iTunes? \n\nA: Although there is no way to browse the store directly, there is this website which searches the iBookstore for a particular title or author. It also searches the Kindle and Nook stores.\nhttp://www.leatherbound.me/\n\nA: Even since iTunes 10.3 this browsing is possible from a Mac or a Windows OS. Browsing(filtering by rating and so on) iTunes is not as pleasant an experience as on the iPad, so you might also choose to browse the store from an iPod touch or an iPhone if you lack an iPad for browsing the store \"natively\".\n\n\nA: Pre iTunes 10.3, the iBookstore was only available from the iBooks app on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. If you know someone who has any of those, you could ask to look, but you cannot see in iTunes.\n", "Q: How do external storage devices work with the iPad? The Apple iPad is a sexy little device, but I have no clues on how the OS on that thingy works, and since it does not come with a USB connection I'm having some problems with how data is moved around on that thingy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple sells a USB converter that you can plug into the iPad so you can connect it with a camera.

In some cases also be able to transfer files over the the NAS\nIs this possible? Someone has told me the iPad is only a \"viewer\", and I understand it is not a creational device... the the simple scenarios described are my minimum spec  \n\nA: You'd need a computer to do those things.\nI.e. you're be able to load the image directly from the camera, and edit them in an appropriate app, but then cannot move the image to the external drive (at least not with another app that allows you to do that). You can transfer the image back to your computer using iTunes, or share it e.g. using Dropbox and access it from there.\n\nRegarding NAS access -- this might be possible (again) using an app that connects to the NAS and allows you to browse and open files there. The iOS itself doesn't expose any file system to the user, be it internal or external.\nYou'd need to use iTunes Home Sharing to do this without any additional software, requiring the NAS files being added to iTunes and your computer to be running.\n\nWhat's possible on iPad (and any iOS device) is rather closely tied to the applications available for it. The system itself doesn't expose a lot of \"power-user\" features like (gasp) file system access to the user.\n\nA: The simple answer to this is: use a cloud solution. There are a couple of free cloud storage service which are fantastic: dropbox.com and box.netfor example. They serve as a wireless NAS and many apps support in-app direct save and open files from those services.\nDropbox.com for example, allow you use your PC or Mac to download a small program, after you install and login, it creates a folder on your desktop. Now, go to your iPad and search for the \"dropbox\" app. After installing and log in, your iPad/iPhone now is sharing an online storage with your PC or Mac. Any files that are put in the Dropbox folder will show up on the iPad/iPhone.\nMost files I share between iPad and iPhone are PDF and Word Files. There is an app called GoodReader, which supports dropbox. You can put the pdf/word into the dropbox folder on your PC or Mac, and then they will be accessible through GoodReader app. \nTry the free dropbox app first and then search for other free apps that supports those services.\nBy the way, another great side benefit for using dropbox or box.net is that you can access all those files from any browser after logging in your account.\n\nA: If you are willing to jailbreak the iPad, and are willing to live within the inherent limitations of the device, then yes, you can do this to some degree. It would require jailbreaking, then getting iFile from the Cydia app store. At this point you can manage the files on your own device. Next, to connect to other devices via USB, you will need to have a powered hub that all those devices are connected to, and then connect the hub to your iPad. Voila!, the iPad, iFile, and the devices should talk to each other just fine.\n(You have to have a powered hub because the iPad does not deliver enough power to hard drives or similar USB devices directly.)\nAs far as a NAS, there may be an app already built that would permit management via the iPhone or iPad without jailbreaking, but to connect to a USB hard drive and manage any of the files you want will require a jailbreak and iFile and a powered hub.\n\nA: I have a Synology DS213J and an iPad. I live in the Uk. Whilst visiting Chile, my photo 'workflow' was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Camera to iPad via Apple USB converter\n\n*Upload to NAS via the free Synology DS File app and QuickConnect (which enables direct connection to the NAS from elsewhere in the world - with decent Wi-Fi).\n\n\nJob done. Photos safe.\n", "Q: Cold temperatures cause finger resistance on  iPad screen I have an issue that I've been experiencing: semi-cold fingers, iPad, and/or room make for a very stubborn drawing experience (I'm an artist that uses the iPad).\nI'm talking indoors, and it doesn't have to be that cold to trigger the problem: even slightly below normal room temperature.\nThere's a real resistance that happens. My fingers don't seamlessly glide around. Slows me down like heck.\nI can't figure out how to fix it (I can rub my fingers quickly on my pants to create friction for a very quick fix).\nCould this be a humidity or a room pressure thing?\nIt's not about too little oil on one's fingers or if the glass is clean. I can't find anything online, although I've talked to some folks who say they sometimes have this problem with their smartphones.\nAnyone know anything about this; and, more importantly, how to circumvent it in a reasonable way?\n\nA: I've had similar issues, and my guess has been that it's due to poor circulation when the temperature drops.\nThe solutions I've come up with are to buy either:\n\n\n*\n\n*a stylus\n\n*a pair of gloves with conductive tips (like these)\n\n*something like the GloveTips 3-Piece Touchscreen Texting Glove Tips (which you can apply to an existing pair of gloves).\n\n\nA: Use some hand lotion or wash your hands and then try again. Dry fingers may cause that.\n\nA: A lot people find anti-glare screen protectors do the trick! They're slightly textured.\n", "Q: Can I tell iTerm 2 to change color when I'm root I would like to tell iTerm2 to have red text whenever I'm root when logged into a server.\nNote:\nI'm not able to change any configuration on the remote server.\n\nA: Not as part of the iTerm 2 configuration. iTerm has no way of knowing you've gone to root in a remote session -- it's not watching what you're doing that closely (and what you're asking it to figure out is actually really complicated to program).\nYou can create an iTerm profile that has red text on whatever background colour you want and you always use that profile when you're going to go to root on a machine. It requires no changes to the root environment on the remote machine. But it does require you remember to use that profile for your rooted session.\nEdit: while digging around I found this interesting article that talks about how you can change the background image in iTerm to show the hostname of the host you've ssh'ed in to. Notice how it's all based around the environment in your client's Mac shell -- once you're on the remote machine there's not a lot iTerm can do. The changing of a tab title does appear to be controlled by $PROMPT_COMMAND, as set in the remote session's environment, but there appear to be no documented hooks in iTerm 2 that let you extend what iTerm does when it changes the tab title. Pity.\nI tell ya: mad props if anyone can figure out how to do this. It'd be handy for sure.\n\nA: I really don´t understand why you say you can´t change any configuration, yet you´re able to use the root user…\nBut anyway, you could run the following line every time you log in to your remote server, which will color your prompt red (and show it as \"root@hostname | /current/directory\" , once you´re root´ed with sudo -s: \nexport SUDO_PS1='\\[\\e[41m\\]\\u @ \\H | \\[\\e[7m\\] $PWD \\[\\e[0m\\] \\n > \\[\\e[0m\\] ' \n\nAssuming the remote server´s sshd configuration has PermitUserEnvironment set to \"yes\", you could hand the PS1 over when you instantiate the ssh connection, something along the lines of (haven´t tried this, though):\nssh user@server -t \"SUDO_PS1='$SUDO_PS1'; exec bash\"\n\n", "Q: Missing glyphs from some fonts Some international fonts (such as Devanagari and others in that area) are apparently missing some glyphs.\nChecking the lower left of wikipedia I get squares (\"missing glyph symbol\"), and going into that site I get only squares too; however, checking in other sites it appears many glyphs are there, but a few are missing.\nWhat can I do to fix this? What could be the problem?\n\nA: This is like asking \"Why is my dictionary missing some words?\"\nJust like no dictionary contains every possible word, no font contains every possible unicode glyph. Remember that someone has to actually create the font, and they aren't going to spend the time to get every possible glyph from every possible language. Especially when the number of glyphs defined is always increasing.\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nNo single \"Unicode font\" includes all the characters defined in the present revision of ISO 10646 (Unicode) standard, as it is continually adding more & more languages and characters. As a result, font developers and foundries are also incorporating those new characters in newer version or revision of a font, and correcting their previous errors if there were any.\n\nIf you are interested, you can see on Wikipedia a comparison of some common Unicode fonts together with the code blocks that they cover. \nYou might try installing Gnu unifont, which seems to have the most complete coverage. To install, just download the font from the site, click on the file, which opens a font preview in FontBook. Just click \"install\" and you are done.\n\nA: The solution is simple: Install fonts that have those characters or force your browser (or viewer) to use fonts, that have those characters.\nUse Font Book application to check what fonts (installed) have it by simply changing the Preview text (Preview->Custom) and then scrolling trough the fonts.\n\nA: Now I've upgraded to 10.10 and it works.\nI also upgraded to 10.8 before that, but I didn't notice if it was already fixed or not.\n", "Q: Why can't some images in the pdf be viewed on iBook of iPad or iPod Touch? I have iPod Touch and iPad (version 1).\nI noticed some images on pdf cannot be viewed on the iBook.\nWhy?\nEdit\nThe following are my pdf ebooks  that cannot be viewed by iBook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro ASP.NET MVC 2 Framework (Expert's Voice in .NET)\n\n*Learn JavaScript and Ajax with w3Schools\nto be continued...\n\nA: I'm going to attempt to answer this as best I can without detailed examples...\nThe screenshots and illustrations (which were most likely placed as EPS or Illustrator files) could be in some format or be corrupted in some way that the iBook PDF engine simply chooses to ignore the image (and is unarguably better than simply crashing).\nPDFs are surprisingly complex documents that can be made in a number of different ways. Essentially, PDF documents are streamlined Postscript, which is a programming language unto itself. Support in PDF viewers for various features varies according to who the developed that particular viewer. \nWe (I) don't know what engine Apple uses to read PDFs (i.e., open source, licensed, homemade), but I would be willing to bet that if those PDFs were opened in Adobe Acrobat, that there would be no problems viewing the art (but please don't ask me how to open iBook-sourced books in Acrobat because I'm not suggesting you do that and I have no idea if for no other reason that I don't use iBooks).\nUpdate: @Jadasc points to a definite possibility to the problem. If the art was, indeed, placed in the layouts as JPEG2000 files, then that's either bad prepress practice or the books you are looking at are ePub files. In either case, without direct access to the books to fix them, I'm not sure what can be done about it.\n\nA: The trouble is in the handling of JPEG2000 image files. Some solutions are offered here. If this was your problem, it was solved with the release of iOS 5. Those images should be viewable now.\n\nA: You can now download the Adobe Reader for iOS. You will be able to view all .PDFs using this free app.\n", "Q: Is there an app that lets you code and send HTML e-mail from your Mac? Apple Mail doesn’t seem to let you edit the source of HTML e-mails (customised stationery workarounds aside).\nIs there a Mac app that lets you send HTML e-mails?\nA bit of Googling turned up HTMLMailer, but it looks like it’s no longer available.\n\nA: Direct Mail will do what you're looking for. You can edit the HTML source code of your message by hand, or use the WYSIWYG editor to manipulate your message. Works with Apple Mail stationery, too.\nWhen you send the message, Direct Mail will also automatically inline your CSS and apply some tweaks so it renders properly in Gmail, Hotmail, and other \"HTML-challenged\" email clients.\nDisclaimer: I'm a developer for Direct Mail.\n\nA: MS Entourage sort of supported this, I don't know if its replacement (MS Outlook) still does. Either way, you'd need MS Office to use it, which probably isn't what you want.\nThis article also suggests a way to achieve something similar to it with Mail.app and Safari, but I haven't tried it to see how well it works.\n\nA: I had some difficulty using the CMD + I method from Safari however you can also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your html file in safari\n\n*CMD + A (select all) \n\n*CMD + C (copy)\n\n*Compose a new message in the Mail app\n\n*CMD + V (paste) in the body of the new message\n\n\nA: There is an app called Direct Mail that has both a \"lite\" and \"pro\" versions. http://ethreesoftware.com/directmail/\n\nA: I routinely use Mozilla Thunderbird for this purpose.\nYou can use the menu item Insert > HTML to either insert a blob of HTML or edit the entire source of your message (CMD + A, Insert > HTML)\n\nA: You can code and design your Mails as HTML(+CSS) documents, open them in Safari.app and then press cmd+i to have the content automatically transferred into Mail.app\nKeep in mind that not all CSS-styles are supported by all Mail-clients, a good overview on that can be found here.\n", "Q: iCal with Google CalDAV issues I currently have iCal syncing to one Google account with 1 main calendar and 3 sub-calendars (selected on Delegation tab). Let's say that this account is example@gmail.com.\nThis is the only one account set up in iCal.\nAdditionally I have 4 email accounts defined in Mail.app in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*example1@example.com\n\n*example2@example.com\n\n*example@gmail.com\n\n*example3@example.com\n\nProblem 1 - iCal will not send out invites to attendees\nI cannot make iCal send invites when creating an event within a calendar that's synced with Google.\nI have to create a local calendar on Mac, create an event there - invites are sent out \"correctly\" (see Problem 2), then I simply move the event from one calendar to another and this seems to do the trick.\nThis seems to be a bit troublesome though (obviously, really). Is there anything I can do to make it work properly - so the invites are sent out from Google's CalDAV calendar?\n\nProblem 2 - iCal invites email addresses\niCal seems to be totally inconsistent with using email addresses when sending invitations.\nConsider the setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 CalDAV account in iCal (example@gmail.com),\n\n*1 local calendar (as mentioned in Problem 1),\n\n*4 email accounts in Mail (as described above).\n\n\nNow iCal seems to be sending invites using the topmost email account set up in Mail.app - in this case example1@example.com. Is there a way to use different email account to do this?\nAlso, it seems that iCal creates invites using the email account defined in iCal accounts - in this case example@gmail.com, even though I use local Calendar and not the CalDAV one!\nThis means that invite is sent from example1@example.com, but people replying to invites send them back to example@gmail.com. This really is plain wrong. Any way to sort it out?\nNOTE: Ideally I'd like iCal to send invites from the second Mail account - example2@example.com.\n\nA: iCal doesn't send invitations - Google Calendar do.\nYou need to set up Notifications for each Google Calendar - main and sub-calendars.\n\"Google Cal->Calendar settings->Calendars->[select calendar]->Notifications->[set check mark at Email and/or SMS for each type of invitations]\"\n\n\nA: Someone needs to read the help files on google's page... Just because you've sync'd your google cal w/ ical doesn't mean you can go & send invites to anyone willy nilly. Have you told google that your going to \"share\" your cal w/ this other person who may or may not have a google account? Did they accept your ical share? As far as \"sending out\" invites, that'll happen off your \"default\" email account. Generally iCal will send out a \"link\" to your event & lots of people just click on that to go to a page where they \"accept\" or \"deny\" or \"reply\" to your invite, so auto received from your gmail account. You could set up a rule to forward them to your other email account if you prefer?\n", "Q: What can I use to enable-disable a ssh tunnel with port forwarding?

I'm Korean and don't have a US address or credit card, but I want to buy content from the US iTunes store.\nI have a PayPal account connected to a Korean bank. Is it possible to add funds to a US iTunes account with PayPal?\n\nA: Yes, you can only use PayPal with iTunes US, and in that PayPal, you'll need to have a US bank account or have your locations and any credit cards/debit's on there will have to be located in the US as iTunes checks for that as well. It all has to be in the US, and cannot have any other bank or CC company for any other country.\n\nA: I don´t think using PayPal with a Korean bank is possible (haven´t tried this, of course), but if you still want to do this (even though this is probably not legal!), you should look on eBay or similar Sites for iTunes gift cards. Then you could theoretically create a new account in the US Store by trying to buy something that is free and then clicking on \"create new account\". Only this would enable you to create an account not associated with any credit card. Next you could activate your Gift card and buy from the US store. Note that you would have to lie about having an actual US address, which will make this probably illegal (or at least breaking the terms of service).\n\nA: As an alternative solution, shop the iTunes US Store whilst in an oversea country with Jerry Cards. Receive high quality scan of the gift cards in your email upon verified payment in your email account, with Paypal or most international credit cards.\n\nA: Use ebay.com and ask seller to email code. I have done this many many times.\nBe warned do, in the last year or so also scammers have found a way to make money by buying cards on eBay and then telling the seller it doesn't work (when it did). This has raised awareness on eBay sellers and is one of the reasons people have stopped with just emailing you the code making it much more expensive and time costly to buy this way.\nI found out that mailing the persons who just added the action telling them your intentions and stating you want to pay with PayPal and are willing to pay the full amount, works the best. Too bad in one way (no more US iTunes Cards from $100,- for $80,-) but seems to work the best. Going after a cheap one takes much more time and hassle (on selling you the code instead of the card with code by airmail).\n\nA: Change your \"store\" in iTunes to Korea since that's where your bank is located. Your money will sit on your \"account\" not in that \"country\". Then change your store to the US store and tada, your in biz. It's completely LEGAL people trade cash like that all day long. But I do warn you to check exchange rates, the Korean currency doesn't equal the US currency value. Having an \"address\" just means the place your at now. ie apartment is fine, just no po boxes, I know several people that have used the local apple store as their \"address\". This is far from lying & it's none of Apple's biz anyway.\n", "Q: Can't add or change custom images of address book entries Sometimes I'm not able to change any of the custom images associated with contacts in the address book. If I quit and restart several times, it eventually works again. \nWhat would cause this sort of thing to happen? I'm running on Snow Leopard.\n\nA: Type in terminal:\nchmod -R 777 /private/var/mobile/Library/AddressBook\nchown -R mobile /private/var/mobile/Library/AddressBook\nIt worked for me\nfrom: http://www.hackint0sh.org/f126/33674.htm\n\nA: Not all address books support custom images.  If the default address book is set to something other than iCloud (ie. Exchange), the contact may not support custom images when created from another application like Messages.\nTo see which account/group a contact card belongs to:\n - Find the contact card using the search dialog.\n - Highlight the contact card by clicking it in the list.\n - Press the Alt key.\n - All groups that the card belongs to will be highlighted (in blue).\nIf you have a card that was created in an account other than iCloud, you can enable the ability to add custom images by also adding that card to iCloud.  To add a card from another account to iCloud:\n - Find the contact card you wish to move using the search dialog.\n - Drag the card to the \"All iCloud\" group under the iCloud account.\n - Select the contact and press edit.\n - You should now be able to add an image to the contact.\nTo change the default address book in which contact cards are created:\n - Open Contacts and select Contacts->Preferences->General from the\n   menu.\n - Change the \"Default Account\" pulldown to \"iCloud\".\n\nA: I had similar issue now with Mavericks.   Looked like it was just an issue with the one contact.   Think I originally created it from mail item that I received.   Deleted the contact and created a new one from with contacts seemed to do trick.   Something in the create from Mail seemed to lock the picture.   No time to investigate just posting my solution in case it helps someone.\n\nA: I have that issue - pictures on Address Book (10.8.x) won't sync with my Exchange server.  The ones that WILL let me change the photos, it turns out, are the contact cards stored in iCloud.  That seems to handle everything just fine.\n\nA: Easy solution: Select the bad contact in the list, copy it, paste it (while it is still selected). For me, that replaced the bad contact with one in which the photo can be edited.\n\nA: Having the same experience on El Capitan, some contacts I can edit the picture, other's I can't the copy and paste routine from Dave worked great. To add a bit more detail.This appears to happen when the contact is stored on an account that doesn't support pictures, eg some exchange accounts.\nOpen the Contacts application on your mac, search or click on the contact you can't edit, then copy and paste without deselecting the contact. Easiest way I found was Ctrl-C then Ctrl-V \nThis recreates the contact in icloud but only shows as one contact. The picture can then me added to the icloud version of the card.\n\nA: To change the picture \nOpen text edit, do command-shift 4 and place the cross hairs over the center of the white page, drag till you have an avatar-sized box and release.\nGo to your desktop or wherever your screen shots are saved, rename and save the file somewhere useful, then go to system prefs/accounts and change the image to the \"white\" picture.\n", "Q: How do I install Eclipse? I just downloaded the .tar ball and unzipped it. It seems to run as a standalone from the folder that was unzipped in my Downloads folder. However, I want to install this so it is in applications, but there are so many other files like configurations. Where do I put those? I tried dragging just the eclipse.app to the applications folder and when i try to run it, it says the shared dependencies are missing.\n\nA: The main Eclipse application needs to be kept in the same folder as its support files otherwise it won't start. What I have done is to keep Eclipse in its own folder, somewhere out of the way, then right-click on the main Eclipse application and select \"Make Alias\". This will create a file called Eclipse alias. You can then move the alias to wherever you want it to be, without worrying about the rest of the Eclipse files. You can move this alias to the Applications folder, and then rename it back to Eclipse.\n\nA: Unfortunately Eclipse is not a well behaved app. Yo need the Eclipse.app and the other files in the downloaded directory to keep the same relative directory structure. Thus you need to move the whole directory from Downloads as is. I moved it to ~/eclipse.helios and then dragged the Eclipse.app into the Dock.\n", "Q: How can I read full song title on my iPod touch or iPhone? When I play or select songs on my iPod touch 4G I often can not read the full title of the song when it is very long. In all views (Coverflow front, coverflow back, now playing portrait mode, playlist) it is always truncated. Especially for classical music this is really annoying because the titles are something in the lines of \"Beethoven: The Complete String Quartetts\" -  \"String Quartett #3 in D Op. 18/3 - 1. Allegro\". Is there some trick to view the complete title?\n\nA: As of iOS 5, this problem is even simpler. Many views will scroll overflowing information, but you can also simply tap and hold on many sources of text in order to view them in a significantly smaller font size in a back pop-up tooltip, which greatly expands the amount of text that can be fit in the width of the iPhone's screen size.\nNote that my previous answer still applies (below), but this tooltip is usually quite a bit faster and much more direct.\n\nFor all iOS versions before iOS 5:\nMy answer on the View Full Podcast Title Question covers this as well. You can use Cover Flow view (rotate your device to Landscape while in the iPod/Music app after selecting a song) in order to greatly increase the amount of room used to display song information.\nYour title is particularly large, I don't know what the landscape/Cover Flow view limit is. I don't have any songs that exceed it yet :).\n", "Q: Insert signature into threaded mail in mail.app When I get a threaded message in mail.app and want to insert my signature under my reply text, then the signature gets inserted at the bottom of the email content.\nIs it possible to insert the mail signature just below the reply text I wrote?\n\nA: Here's the setting you're looking for.  It will always put your sig above quoted text.\nMail -> Preferences, Signatures.\n\n\nA: As a follow-up to this question (apologies, can't comment w/18 rep), why is it not possible to choose to have the signature at the top or the bottom for individual replies? For some, I would like the signature before the quoted text; for others, I'd like the signature after.\n", "Q: Change Mac OS X Wireless Card Country Code I have problem connecting to a wireless router using Mac OS X which is on channel 13. This is because there is some other router nearby which is broadcasting the US country code. The only way around this i have found so far, is to each time go to the router and restart the computer.\nI have asked google and it seems to be a mixture of people who think that it is setting the locale changes it, or that it is fixed in the router firmware. Both i have shown to be wrong. man ifconfig also has not been too enlightening. \nDoes anyone know of another way to force the card to use a different country Code or channels? \nI would rather not change to another channel, as there is alot of interference near by (shown with KisMAC).\nThanks \n\nEdits\nFound \n\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport\n\nWhich appears to allow for an arbitary channel to be set on the card, but not county code. This seems to have no effect.\n\nA: 802.11d is the protocol that wireless access points use to broadcast (among other things) the regulatory domain (i.e. country codes) in which it is supposed to be operating. It seems that there may be no clear rule for what to do when various equipment is broadcasting conflicting regulatory domain information.\nThe ideal solution would be to disable/replace/reconfigure the equipment that is broadcasting the incorrect information.\nI found an (oldish) Apple Discussions thread that indicates that indicates that a Mac’s AirPort hardware will use the first country code it hears after powering on or waking from sleep. Later postings in the thread (on the second page) indicate that it is sufficient to just power off/on the AirPort hardware itself and not the whole system. A couple of people reported success using a script to repeatedly turn the AirPort interface off and on (using networksetup) until it happened to acquire the desired state (as reported by system_profiler).\n\nBased on TA25972, it seems that older equipment (presumably models that do not listen for 802.11d information) may not even be able to switch “country codes”.\n\nA: I got this problem to, and I solved it!\nAll I wanted to do is to disable the 802.11d beacon function. This is impossible to do in any available settings on the Mac OS X. \nHowever you can binary patch the network card driver thinking the country code is always X2.\nSo apparently, what I would have to do is change/binary patch the network driver with the string 0x81 0x78 0x30 0x6B 0x10 0x00 0x00 0x0F 0x85 to 0x81 0x78 0x30 0x6B 0x10 0x00 0x00 x90 0xE0. This forces the driver to use country code «X2» whatever beacon is being sent, so it will never change. \nYou could either change this with a hex-editing utility or copy and paste the following very handy one-liner in the terminal application:\nsudo perl -pi -e 's|\\x81\\x78\\x30\\x6B\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x0F\\x85|\\x81\\x78\\x30\\x6B\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x90\\xE9|' /System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AirPortBrcm4360.kext/Contents/MacOS/AirPortBrcm4360 && sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/\n\nThis solution works for Mac Book Pro Retina 2013.\n\nA: the problem come from the implementation of 802.11d : wifi location and country ID conflicts.\nif there are different wifi Access points broadcasting mixed countries ID, Mac OS may shut down certain frequencies.\nSolution at the end of the post   :)))\nJust after a restart my MacBook Pro 16 is set to locale ETSi and country code X3\nAll channels and frequencies are opened.\nIf i stop and restart the wifi, or the Mac goes in power save mode and turn off the radios. When it wakes up i got this: Country code ID, and most of the supported channels are gone.\nThere's a lot of posts about this on the internet, about either adding another AP and setting county code.\nSome APs (like mikrotik don't broadcast country codes)\nSome posts are about modifying the wifi drivers.\nDon't do any of that, the solution is quite simple !!!\nI'm now on MacOS 11.0.1 Big Sur.\nBut i assume the solution is the same on previous MacOS Versions\nGo to:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Menu -> System preferences\n\n*Security & Privacy -> Location Services\n\n*Scroll down till you find System Services\n\n*Click on Details...\n\n*Uncheck WiFi Networking\n\nThis will bypass 802.11d implementation and 5ghz will show up right away\n\nA: Easiest solution to conflicting country code - your MAC is picking up the incorrect country code from the 'nearest' broadcasting router.....so if one of your close neighbours has an incorrect country code your own router assumes it is in that 'wrong' country - and it messes up your internet connection - SOLUTION - get an old router that you no longer use - and just plug it into the power supply and place it near to your live router.....make sure your old router is set-up with the correct country code but DO NOT connect it to the internet. Then your MAC will pick up the country code from this 'dummy' router and adopt the correct country code.....problem solved. This appears to work for me, and I have been bugged with this problem for so long.....I live in China and there are about 60 neighbours  routers all around my apartment broadcasting many different country codes NIGHTMARE. \nIncidentally, this solves one of my problems - but if anyone knows how to beat the Great Firewall and solve the problem of randomly high latency when using VPN that would be a bonus........just be grateful you are not working in China.....its internet is evil.   \n\nA: Here was my issue:\nI brought my iMac over from the US to Canada. In Canada, I could not connect to my home network and noticed Wireless Diagnostics reporting a conflicting country code issue. ( I could still connect to my US based iPhone hotspot without issues). It seems my iMac's network interface was still set to \"US\" and it was complaining about all the other routers in the area, including my home router, as being \"CAN\".\nOpening Wireless Diagnostics -> Scan, I could see that there was one network that was broadcasting \"US\" region. This network was probably what was preventing my iMac from automatically changing region to \"CAN\" (I had previously brought this iMac back and forth between US/CAN without issue). Despite multiple restarts to the iMac and the home router, I could not get the iMac to change its country code.\nThe offending \"US\" network was a weak signal, broadcasting from somewhere in the neighbourhood. I figured if I could get the iMac to stop detecting this network, it might notice all the surronding as being \"CAN\", and automatically switch over to \"CAN\" as it's supposed to. So I relocated the iMac to the basement. Upon restart, I still had problems connecting to the home router. However, looking at the wireless diagnostic on the \"conflict country codes\" issue, I could see now though that the iMac's country code had changed to \"CAN\" and the \"US\" network was reported as being conflicting!\nDespite the iMac now having the correct country code, it took me a couple more restarts of the iMac and a restart to the router before WiFi finally started working.\ntl;dr try to weaken the signal of the offending network by temporarily relocating your Mac until the Mac fixes the country code\n\nA: I had faced a similar issue with my 2020 MacBook Air M1 series Big Sur laptop.\nThe scan showed me a result which showed my default CC for 2.4G, but CC - DE for 5G network.\nUpon connecting to Apple support chat, I was provided this page https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202480 which made me to connect the 5G network without any issues.\nHowever I am still able to see the CC as DE, but I do not have any issues in connecting to the 5G network and switching it between 2.4 to 5 or vice versa.\nLooks like this is a workaround. However for now I am happy with it.\n\nA: If you use AirPortBrcm4331 driver on El Capitan:\n\n\n*\n\n*restart in Recovery mode (CMD+r while booting), open terminal and run csrutil disable\n\n*restart, open terminal and run\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo perl -pi -e 's|\\x30\\x6B\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x0F\\x85\\xEA|\\xFF\\xFF\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x0F\\x85\\xEA|g' /System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AirPortBrcm4331.kext/Contents/MacOS/AirPortBrcm4331\n\n*sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/\n\n\n*restart in Recovery mode (CMD+r while booting), open terminal and run csrutil enable\n\nA: So I had this issue where my Macbook Air sets the country code to \"cn\", thinking it's in China, not being able to connect and even see my 5GHz Wi-Fi because apparently my router doesn't support any Chinese channels.\nSo as it turns out, the Wi-Fi adapter doesn't have a hard-coded country code but instead sets the country by sniffing around for specific packages to determine in which country is(This is supposed to help when travelling since the routers would not usually cross borders but your MacBook will). This means if there's network hardware which broadcasts packages indicating that this is China and it first picks that one, my Macbook will set the country code to \"cn\" and limit my Wi-Fi channels to Chinese ones.\nTo find out about the BSSIDs and the county codes they are advertising run the following command in the terminal. A TextEdit window will open with a list of the networks.\n/S*/*/P*/*/*/*/*/airport -s | open -ef\n\nIn My particular situation, the culprit was the Xiaomi Mi range extender in the corridor and turning it off before enabling Wi-Fi on my Macbook allowed it to pick the correct country code. \nCredit goes to Linc Davis: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6665548?answerId=27085786022#27085786022\n\nA: My problem is a bit different then the question, but I felt that I need to share as it is a bit related. \nI can confirm that https://github.com/alessandro893/MacOS-WLAN-Driver app worked, I have MacBook Pro 13 Retina from 2013 that stuck in ID country code, I bought my MBP there. Long story short, I move to Israel, turn out they have different channel for 5Ghz, none of allowed 5GHz channels in Israel matched 5Ghz channel in Indonesia. \nAfter a year trying to figure it out what to do, I decide to run that app. I was a bit skeptic as the previous answer was not the promoted one, but I have nothing to lose. The apps just recently updated to allow manually country code typed. So as previous answer suggest, I change to X2 country code, and now I can see all the available AP around me, including previous one that was unavailable. \n\nUpdate: Sadly SIP (System Integrity Protection) need to be disable all the time for this trick to work, this make your Mac less secure. Today I tried to enable SIP (csrutil enable), and the trick stop working. I also notice that this trick didn't work in recovery mode and boot loader. I wish Apple provide a real way to change country code because it seems like it just driver problem.\n\nA: I very much prefer Rich Freed OM's solution, but for what it's worth:\n\n*\n\n*I set up my iphone as my hotspot.\n\n*The Mac connected to my iphone bypassing the country check.\n\n*I then selected my actual wifi connection and it worked.\n\nHowever my iphone is now having the same problem \nHonestly I don't know why it doesn't either:\nallow disabling, or choose the country based on ALL routers rather than the first\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my wifi router but when I set the router to 5 ghz and the channel to auto the problem was solved. \n\nA: I found a slightly bizarre solution. I tried all the solutions Google comes up with, none worked but I saw an article that mentions KisMAC can see channel 13. Installed it and then suddenly my country code changed from US to X3 and now I can connect on channel 13.\n\nA: All I had to do on my mid 2010 MacBook Pro is to change the kext name from AirPortBrcm4360 to AppleAirPortBrcm43224 and I finally got my location right! \n\nA: https://github.com/alessandro893/MacOS-WLAN-Driver\nMay be this helps, you can ask author for modifying US country code in os x driver\n", "Q: MAMP installation change password I changed the root user password in phpMyAdmin and now it cannot connect to the database. Does anyone know where, in the MAMP folder structure, where to hardcode the new password in?\n\nA: Inside: /Applications/MAMP/bin/phpMyAdmin, there is a file named config.inc.php.\nInside of that file in your favorite text editor, you should be able to search for $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] and then modify the text in single quotes. (Which is 'root' by default.) Change that to whatever you changed your password to, ensure it's quoted as necessary, and refresh. You should instantly be connected!\n", "Q: iPhone Application for Email Address Shortcut Does anybody know of an iPhone application or shortcut that allows you to save your email address access it via a shortcut?  This would be super useful when filling in forms in Safari or in when your email address is required in an application.\n\nA: An excellent application for shortcuts is Smile Software's TextExpander touch. Because of limitations in iOS, it doesn't work to expand shortcuts in every app (including, sadly, all of Apple's apps). From the manufacturer's site:\n\nGiven the current feature set of the\n  iPhone OS, TextExpander touch cannot\n  work in the background (as it does in\n  Mac OS X), expanding text snippets\n  while you work in other apps, except\n  for apps with TextExpander-integration\n  built-in. You must first compose your\n  text in the TextExpander touch Compose\n  screen, and then transfer it to\n  another app.\n\n\nA: If you are willing to jailbreak, Action Menu does what you are looking for. I have put my e-mail address in the favorites tab of that program and I can now reach it anywhere.\n", "Q: Force a file to overwrite instead of appending I've got an application that won't overwrite a file with the same filename. It will only append the filename with a 'space 1'. If I write a file more than once I get something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*filename.jpg\n\n*filename 1.jpg\n\n*filename 2.jpg\n\n\nWhat I need is to only ever have the newest file without the extra space and number.\nIs there anyway around this? Perhaps an applescript running in the folder?\n\nA: The application is in complete control of how it saves files (overwrite v. append). The answer is to pre-clean your destination before you start whatever work flow you are doing in Capture One. There are any number of ways to accomplish that. \n\n\n*\n\n*use the rm command from the terminal\n\n*write a bash script that does something more complicated\n\n*write an applescript\n\n*create a new folder each time to point the application at\n\n*create a disk image via Disk Utility that you can clone and throw away when finished\n\n\nThese are just some of the ideas. I am sure there are other ways as well. Just need to find one that works for you.\nA final thought, contact the makers of Capture One and make a case for why you would like them to change the software. Perhaps they will listen. :)\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Excel from opening recovered files? I unfortunately tried to open a few Excel files that have huge amounts of data. After 20 minutes they were not opened yet, so I did a force quit.\nThe problem now is that when I launch Excel, the program wants to open all the files that were opening when I did the force quit, which hangs Excel and brings me back to where I was. Arghh!\nI tried logging out and then in again but it didn't help. Something somewhere remembers everything.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: You are probably dealing with an AutoRecover issue. The Office programs will try to reopen documents that are open when the programs crash (a Force Quit is essentially a crash to the programs).\nThis link explains what's going on and how to recover from the problem. To quote the relevant part:\n\nAutoRecover saves files in the ~:Documents:Microsoft User Data:Office 2008 AutoRecovery folder. These files are hidden, and their file names starts with ~ar.\nYou can see hidden files if you navigate to the folder above in Finder, type ⌘F, and choose FIle Invisible from the Kind dropdown - if that's not an option, choose Other..., and check the  File Invisible checkbox - and set it to Invisible.\n\nTry making the hidden files visible, then moving them to the Desktop, then start Excel. Of course, if you're using Office 2004 or Office 2011, they will have their own AutoRecovery folders.\n", "Q: How do I prevent my MacBook Air from forgetting my Remapped Caps Lock Key? As someone who doesn't like to shout, I have Caps Lock remapped to Control on all of my computers. A second control key is far more useful to a guy who spends most of his time in Terminal.app. This was set up in System Preferences under Keyboard and Modifier Keys.\nMy MacBook Air (MacBookAir3,2) keeps 'forgetting' this setting every couple of days and reverting to SHOUTY CAPS LOCK. I haven't yet pinpointed when it is reverting.

I have an iPhone 3G and I may be upgrading to an iPhone 4 tonight. I'm on AT&T. Once I get up and running on iPhone development, I'm thinking I want to keep the old phone around to test how apps run on the older, slower phone. \nAfter moving to the new phone exactly how does the process with the old phone work? As in, is it now just a phone without a SIM card (so, an iPod Touch essentially)? Do I have to jailbreak it to keep it active? Is there anything else to look out for?\nThis might be a \"duh\" question so go ahead and close it if it is.\n\nA: When I upgraded from 3 to 4, after I setup the iPhone 4 to sync with my computer, I took the iPhone 3 and used the reset-erase function on the iPhone and then when I connected it to my iTunes, I gave it a new name (so I could setup different sync options). I use it as an extra ipod-like device for the kids to play with or watch movies on when we are traveling.\nNote: the iPhone 4 has a different sized SIM card than the iPhone 3 so you won't be just swapping them. I had to go to the AT&T store to affect the move from my iPhone 3 to iPhone 4. The iPhone 3 just has an inactive SIM card in it.\nI didn't have to Jailbreak it to keep using it. And you can still use it with XCode Organizer to install applications that you are developing for testing purposes.\n\nA: If you just remove or deactivate the SIM card, and don't upgrade or restore the OS, an iPhone 3G will function normally and act like an iPod Touch (or iPhone 3G with no cellular connection).\nBoth my 3G and 3GS are being used for iOS development (sans cellular) this way.\nIf you do upgrade or restore the OS, you may need a SIM card to reauthorize the iPhone, but the old deactivated SIM card (don't throw it away) seems to still work for this purpose.\n\nA: Apple has a support article that lets you turn your iPhone into an iPod:\n\nFollow these steps to use your iPhone without a wireless service plan:\n\n*\n\n*Insert the SIM card from your new, activated iPhone or one that was previously used to activate the original iPhone.\n\n*Connect the iPhone to iTunes on a computer connected to the Internet.\n\nOnce iTunes activates the device, you're free to use the iPhone as if it were an iPod touch.\n\n", "Q: Is MacBook Pro warming during gaming normal? I have a 2010 MacBook Pro MC371 (Core i5, GeForce 320M, 4Gb RAM). \nWhen I launch a game either new one (i.e. Starcraft 2) or rather old (Unreal Tournament 2004, bootcamped) my MacBook gets rather warm, even hot in the top left corner, around the place where magsafe charger is plugged in. The temperature is more than 40C. The fact that confuses me is that this warming occures even when I play old games.\nIs that OK?\n\nA: Yes. That's normal. As for \"okay\" -- it depends. The heat is coming from the extra graphic activity and CPU activity you're asking your machine to perform when playing the games. The MBPro is vented at the back, along the hinge between the screen and the keyboard, you want to make sure that area is free of obstructions and the hot air can leave escape unimpeded. Long-term exposure to high operating temperatures can certainly be detrimental to the components in your machine. But for the most part, if your machine's venting is unobstructed, it should be able to cool itself adequately.\n\nA: Have the same MBP as you and it happens to me as well. As Ian C. says your MBP uses discrete gfx card for games and they tend to heat quite a lot. They use a lot more power to render graphics and using power has a side effect which is heat - normall stuff.\nWhat you say was 40C was more likely to be something around 60-70C. 40C is about normal working temperature for it.\n", "Q: Can I make my Mac OS X Terminal color items according to syntax, like the Ubuntu terminal?

Looks like the Ubuntu color scheme has changed since the post by @sorens above, as what that post suggests doesn't match what I have on Ubuntu at all.\nAdd this to your .bashrc or .bash_profile:\n# Use default ls output on Ubuntu\nalias ls='ls -Fa'\n\n# Use Ubuntu coloring scheme (as close as it gets)\nexport CLICOLOR=1\nexport LSCOLORS=ExGxFxbaCxbabahbaDacec\n\nI believe it's as close as it gets to Ubuntu. I compiled this manually, based on the original dircolors -b output from my Ubuntu (dircolors is the util used to generate coloring of various file/dir types there).\nI tested it for a while, but if you happen see any mismatches, please write a comment.\nA couple of mismatches that I believe cannot be fixed on Mac:\n\n*\n\n*A couple of colors are not an exact match (orange background -> yellow as Mac's ls doesn't have orange, orange foreground -> red) but it looks almost the same on my computer.\n\n*Unfortunately Mac's ls doesn't allow coloring of file types, so images, video, audio files and archives aren't colored as in Ubuntu. I see no way to distinguish those files in Mac ls. Which is a huge miss indeed.\n\nReferences\nThis may be useful if you want to tweak the colors.\n\n*\n\n*My original dircolors -b output (I trimmed the big part with file extension coloring, as I don't believe it can be used on Mac).

Is there a combination of math functions I could use in spotlight to accomplish change of base ? I know I can do it on a case by case basis with normal algebra.\n\nA: The algebraic way to do it is logbx=logax/logab. In spotlight, the log(x) function is log10x and the ln(x) function is logex. So taking logbx would be log(x)/log(b). However, rounding is significant enough to have the answer off even if it should be a whole number. For example, I tested log(4)/log(2) and got 1.9999999997 when it should be exactly 2.\n", "Q: Can you lock your screen on OS X? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a quick way to lock my Mac? \n\nDoes OS X have the option to allow you to lock your screen?\n\nA: Yes set System Preferences->Security->General to require password after screen saver begins\nAnd in System Preferences->Desktop & Screen Saver->Screen Saver hit the hot corners button and choose  one or more of the corners to Start Screen Saver\nThere are also Dashboard Widgets to help here.

Is there any app like NitroDesk's TouchDown Android email client for iOS?\nJust for background info, many companies force you to have the latest version of iOS installed to access Exchange Server, or you can have a secure client like TouchDown. That means you're out of luck if you're on an unsupported phone such as iPhone 2G which cannot have the latest version of iOS and cannot run TouchDown since it's Android only.\nEDIT:\nI know the latest version of iOS Mail App has similar features to TouchDown. I'm asking this question because some users may have an iPhone 3G which will not be upgradeable to iOS 4.3, hence they will not be able to access Exchange from their iPhone unless there is an app similar to TouchDown available.\n\nA: how about the iOS version of TouchDown? :-)\nhttp://nitrodesk.com/touchdown/ios/\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchdown-for-ios/id560596861?mt=8\n\nA: I wish. I am running Touchdown on three android devices, and cannot get Exchange 2003 to work on a single iOS device. \nThe problem? Apple does not support anything but EAS (Active Sync) so, if there is no Active Sync on your exchange server, you're toast - or you need to deal with your IT staff - and I bet security will be an issue.\n\nA: Try Outlook Web Email - http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outlook-web-email/id428974099?mt=8\n", "Q: How to backup Bootcamp partition via Time Machine? I just started using Time Machine for backup of my late 2009 MBP.\nSo far it's backing up only OS X partition and ignoring Bootcamp partition.\nI also see the point Time Machine completely ignores NTFS and FAT32 partitions.\nLooking for solution/ hack to include Bootcamp partition also included in my Time Machine backups.\n\nA: This may well be too late to be helpful, but it is quite possible to back up a Boot Camp volume via Time Machine. (And the previous answerer clearly didn't even understand the question, since he appears to be talking about writing backups to an NTFS drive.)\nIn fact, it's really easy. Rename the 'BOOTCAMP' volume to anything other than 'BOOTCAMP' and Time Machine will recognize it as a back-up-able drive. Then go to the Time Machine preference panel and click on 'Options...'  You should now be able to select your NTFS volume and remove it from the exclusion list. Next time you run a backup, it will back up the NTFS drive.\nHOWEVER: It may not be possible to restore a bootable NTFS drive from a Time Machine backup, due to permissions issues, metadata, etc. (Restoring would involve installing NTFS-3g or otherwise mounting an NTFS volume as read/write, and then restoring files to that, too, so remember there's an extra step.) Given that, though, it's a good way of saving your data files on Windows, if you have enough room on your backup drive.\nIf I have time, I may try a full restore from my backup to my boot camp partition. If I do, I'll record the results here.\nEDIT: This may only work with 10.6, and/or may only work if you have MacFUSE and NTFS-3G installed.\nEDIT: As far as I can tell, this has not worked correctly since 10.7. I have not yet tested it with 10.9, but in both 10.7 and 10.8 the boot camp partition is not backed up no matter what it is named.\n\nA: Time Machine relies on extended attributes that can't be stored in FAT32, and since OS X doesn't come with NTFS support Apple hasn't defined a way for Time Machine's extended attributes to be stored in NTFS, so even with NTFS-3g Time Machine wouldn't know how to keep its metadata.\nAny hack to add this support would have to hook into the guts of Time Machine, and as far as I know Apple hasn't provided any way to do this.\n\nA: What I ended up doing is using an external USB drive, but partitioning it into 2 pieces, one with HPFS+ for Time Machine and the other with NTFS for Windows 7 backup.\nThis actually makes it where you have 2 different backups. One for OS X through Time Machine, another for Windows 7 through Windows 7 Backup. Make sure to make a restore CD from Windows 7.\nWhen you go to restore, first you will restore OS X, then go through the Boot Camp partitioning process. When it's time to boot from the Windows CD, wait for it to boot, then shut it down and put the restore CD in (making sure the backup drive is attached). Then go through the restore process for Windows.\n\nA: It sounds like you want Winclone, which will generate an image from your Windows partition, and allow you to restore that image to another partition.\nAs others have said, Time Machine only works with Mac partitions, by design. But Winclone is a package designed for Mac users to take clones of Windows partitions from within OSX.\nIt is not free (it costs $30), but you did not explicitly say that you needed a free solution.\nI am not affiliated with the people that produce Winclone, but I am a satisfied user.\n", "Q: iWork '09 Keeps asking to be Registered I'm a teacher in a classroom with 8, 9 10 and 11 year olds who each have a macbook or a macbook pro.

Will it last or will it break? Does anyone have experience?\n\nA: Anecdotally, I attended the Detroit Auto Show this year.  Audi had cleverly embedded iPads into the information stands next to all their cars, running their own information app. The home button was covered by the stand, so the app couldn't be exited. It made for a very impressive display.\nI was there during the final weekend of the (very high traffic) two-week show. All of the iPads were functioning marvelously, and the screens were all in very good shape. That said, there was no well to tell if any had needed to be replaced. Take it as you will.\n\nA: My university's computer store has had three iPads on display since launch, probably hundreds of people per-day using them. They're all in perfect condition.\nI will give this tip: Make sure that they're physically locked down such that they can't move. The reason being that if you have them simply tethered to a security cable and to the dock connector, the dock connector cable will eventually begin to fray. It happened on all three iPads. Those cables just aren't designed to be permanently attached and constantly twisted, so make sure that the iPad can't move.\n\nA: Well Apple stores have thousands of people handling iPads every day so I think it should be fine.\nI would probably have a 2nd one on call just in case you do have to replace it.\nMatt B raises a good point though about the Home button. If you jailbreak the device then you could possibly reprogram that button, however as it is you'd have to cover it.\n\nA: We just recently created a large wall of 24 iPads for a particular event show.\nThe iPads were fine and lasted for between 9-10.5 hours displaying constantly.\n", "Q: Programmatically/Script-atically changing the default Open-With setting Is there a way to change what app opens a file type programmatically/with a script?\nBasically, sometimes I'm working on a web site, and I want to set all web files to open with a text editor (*.php, *.html, *.htm, etc...).\nHowever, other times, I want to just view the files, so I want them to open with a browser.\nRight now, I'm dragging items onto dock icons, which works, but is slow, particularly when I'm going through a large number of files with the keyboard only. \nBasically, what I want is a small applescript/whatever that changes all the open-with settings.\nThat way, I can have one script for each open-with program, and change back and forth.\nThanks.\n\nA: One option is to edit ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=com.adobe.pdf;LSHandlerRoleAll=net.sourceforge.skim-app.skim;}'\nYou can use PlistBuddy to check if entries already exist, but I haven't found any way to apply changes without restarting or rebuilding the Launch Services database.\nUsing duti, you could run duti ~/.duti after saving this as ~/.duti:\nnet.sourceforge.skim-app.skim .pdf all\n\n\nA: This is doable, but probably isn't as straightforward as you might think.  You'll need to get very familiar with Uniform Type Identifiers.  Look at Wikipedia's Uniform Type Identifier page.\nOS X stores information on preferred file associations in a preference file with the name com.apple.LaunchServices.plist.  Before you go try to find and modify that file, I suggest you familiarize yourself with OS X's domain hierarchy for defaults (a.k.a. \"settings\").  A decent article on this can be found here. (Disclaimer: they seem to be selling something on that site. I don't know what it is and have no association with them, the explanation is just a good one.)\nNow that you know all about defaults and UTIs (er, not the medical kind), now we can talk about setting file associations from a script/command line.\nFirst, you'll need to know the proper way to identify the files for which you want to make an association.  \nRemember how I said UTIs were important?  There are multiple ways to identify a file.  It depends on if the type has been formally declared on your system or not.  For example, decent text editors like TextMate or TextWrangler will add quite a few type declarations to the type hierarchy when you use them on your system.  If, however, you don't have those applications, you may not have those types declared.\nOK, enough talk.  Examples:\nGet the UTI for a file:\n$ mdls myFile.xml\n...\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.xml\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.xml\",\n    \"public.text\",\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.content\"\n)\n...\n\nOk, cool.  An explicit content type we can use.  Write that down somewhere.\n$ mdls myFile.myExtn\n...\nkMDItemContentType             = \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8048pftb4g6\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.item\"\n)\n...\n\nOops.  OS X doesn't know about \".myExtn\" files.  So, it created a dynamic UTI that we can't use for anything.  And the parent types are too generic to be useful.\nNow that we know what our files are, lets look at the LaunchServices.plist file and see what we can do:\n$defaults read com.apple.LaunchServices\n{\n    ...\n    LSHandlers =     (\n                {\n            LSHandlerContentType = \"public.html\";\n            LSHandlerRoleAll = \"com.apple.safari\";\n            LSHandlerRoleViewer = \"com.google.chrome\";\n        },\n    ...\n                {\n            LSHandlerContentTag = myExtn;\n            LSHandlerContentTagClass = \"public.filename-extension\";\n            LSHandlerRoleAll = \"com.macromates.textmate\";\n        },\n    ...\n    );\n    ...\n}\n\nSo, when you have a \"good\" content type to use, the first construct is better.  Otherwise the other construct.  Note, there are other constructs in that file, but they aren't relevant to what you asked.  Just know they are there when you look through the output.\nAs you can see, you'll need to find the UTI for the application you want to use.  The UTIs for Safar and TextMate are in my example above, but to generically find the UTI for an application:\n$ cd /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents\n$ less Info.plist\n...\n        <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>\n        <string>com.apple.Safari</string>\n...\n\nNOTE: I have no idea what constitutes the difference between LSHandlerRoleAll and LSHandlerRoleViewer.  I can't find documentation on that anywhere.  What I do see is that 99% of the time LSHandlerRoleAll is the only one set (i.e. there is no LSHandlerRoleViewer at all) and that it is set to the UTI for the application that you desire to associate the type with.\nHaving brought you this far, I'm going to leave HOW to set the values you want as an exercise for the reader.  Messing with these things can be somewhat dangerous.  It is entirely possible for you to screw up a file and not have ANY of your file associations work.  Then you have to throw away the file and start over.\nSome hints:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read up on defaults write and its syntax\n\n*Take a look at PlistBuddy.  man PlistBuddy and /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h\n\n*Skip all this nonsense altogether and use RCDefaultApp\n\nA: It doesn't really answer your question, but might be a solution.\nThe Inspector in Finder presents information for the currently selected file, or files:\n⌘+⌥+I \nThe Summary Info window of Finder is useful when multiple files are selected: \n^+⌘+I\nIf you select multiple files of the same type, then either method above will allow you to easily switch the Open with: property for those files.\n\nA: Not an answer to your exact question, but another possible solution. You can open a document with a specific application from the command line with the -a argument to open. \nFor example, open all the html files in the current directory.\n> open -a 'Google Chrome' *.html\n\nOpen index.html and the javascript controller files in the Atom text editor:\n> open -a 'atom' index.html js/controllers/*.js\n\nDepending on your needs, you could modify this to be an Automator service which could be assigned a shortcut key, taking in the selected file paths as an argument.\nHere's an example Automator AppleScript that receives files as input and opens the selected files in Chrome:\non run {input, parameters}\nset openFiles to \"open -a 'Google Chrome' \" --note the trailing space\nset filePaths to {}\n\n--covert the filePaths to posix style\nrepeat with i from 1 to count of input\n    set aFile to input's item i as alias\n    set aFile to quoted form of POSIX path of aFile\n    set filePaths's end to aFile\nend repeat\n\n--convert filePaths list to a string delimited by spaces\nset tid to text item delimiters\nset text item delimiters to \" \"\nset filePaths to filePaths as text\nset text item delimiters to tid\n\n--Open files via commandline\ndo shell script openFiles & filePaths\nreturn input\n\nend run\nObviously, you could change the app name \"Sublime\" text editor, save it as another service, and assign them both shortcut keys. \n", "Q: i need to charge my ipod while connecting to an accessory I'm looking to charge my iPod via USB or car charger while still being able to use a sync cable accessory with the iPod.

So if you type \nvi /some/long/path/to/a/../../name  that's what the tab will show, or at least as much of it as will fit.\nAt this time I have not found a way to set the title bar differently from the tab.\n\nA: You could install xtermcontrol (also via fink, macports, etc.), and then use that to set the title to whatever you want. I have the following cd in my .bash_profile, so that any time I change directories the directory is in the xterm window title:\ncd() {\n  if [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n    builtin cd \"$@\"; xtermcontrol --title \"$@\"\n  else\n    builtin cd ~;  xtermcontrol --title \"~\"\n  fi\n}\n\nYou can also set up aliases or customize your ssh settings so that hostnames are added to the title when you leave this host, etc.\n", "Q: Keeping the GIMP tool bar on top? I've seen a lot of discussion about this through googling, but found no answers. In GIMP for Mac, I just want to keep all the dialog windows above my main document window. Is it possible?\n\nA: You could use the SIMBL extension, afloat. I use this tool all the time, especially when working with reference images and the like.\n", "Q: Is there a way to evaluate OS X without purchasing Macintosh hardware? I'd like to play with OS X to see what makes it tick under the covers for the purpose of IT support - at CWRU here we have a lot of Mac-using professors. However, I can't justify spending twice as much on hardware as I would purchasing from any other vendor. Therefore, I'd like to avoid getting Apple hardware. I know you do get something for that money (nobody else does anything like Apple's aluminum unibody), but I don't need that for what I'm doing.\n(Even the cheapest MacBook Pro is $1,199.00 -- compare to Lenovo, which itself is one of the most expensive PC makers, $809.00 for the same specs. [Okay, the Lenovo has a bit smaller hard disk, but it has a faster CPU and discrete graphics, so it's kind of a wash.])\nIs there any (supported) way to do that or am I forced to purchase Mac hardware?\n\nA: If you live near an Apple Store, you can always take an afternoon or evening to \"evaluate OS X\" and the machines in the store.  The employees seem to be very gracious and happy to let you evaluate for quite a while.\nWhat do you want to \"Evaluate\"?  Whether it runs the programs you need it to run?  Whether it runs quickly? How long the battery lasts?  How much they weigh? \nAlso - you can speak with the sales team - I've never had any problem returning a Mac that I bought to an Apple store and getting a refund if it's not what I needed. When there is uncertainty of the fit of the product, I've long had them say they will waive a restocking fee and I believe there is no return fee chain wide at present.\n\nA: The OP is asking for a \"supported\" way and I guess that means \"Apple approved\", but I still want to point out that it is very possible and actually quite easy to run OSX on commodity hardware. There's a whole community out there dedicated to making it as easy as possible. My workstation (Intel core i7, Nvidia graphics) has been running the latest version of OSX for two years now, with no problems.\nThe installation procedure that once was more of a hack is now down to booting from a USB stick and installing from an original (bought) OSX DVD.\nThe relevant term to put into Google is \"OSx86\".\n\nA: You can get a refurbished Mac starting at $599 for a Mac Mini. You can usually find even lower prices for older Macs on eBay or Craigslist.\n\nA: You can't run Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware. It's not allowed by the EULA for OS X and it is technologically enforced by having key parts of the OS in the copyrighted hardware ROM installed in the Apple hardware.  Furthermore, all versions of OS X prior to Leopard and non-server versions of Leopard and Snow Leopard had architectural issues that prevented virtualization even if you wanted to hack something like VirtualBox or VMware to virtualize them in violation of the EULA and copyrights. \nIncidentally, while you can virtualize OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard Server as well as both versions of OS X Lion, the license still limits this to Apple Hardware. \nVirtualBox supports virtualizing OS X Snow Leopard Server. You can find instructions for doing this here.  VMware Fusion supports virtualizing OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard Server as well as OS X Lion client and server versions.  \n\nA: Obviously this is already marked as answered, but you can always hire a Mac or find a very cheap second hand one to buy. \n... For example I have an old 15\" MacBookPro that I'd hire out for $20 a day plus deposit, I'm in Sydney, Australia though so that's probably not a great deal of use to you.\nBut try a want ad on the bulletin board at CWRU, or wherever works best in your locality.\n\nA: The author of the question appears to work for a huge academic institution.\nBig institutions are usually compelled to obey legal terms and conditions in ways individuals are not.  For that reason I would strongly recommend he bite the bullet and buy a real Mac.  A Hacintosh could put him in big trouble with his supervisors/administrators.\nYou can buy used Macs, incidentally, but they are not generally that good a deal - they hold their value too well.\nThe cute 11\" MacBook Air is $999 and the cool factor's off the charts - I might suggest that as a good thought.  And you'll save a few bucks with the academic price.\n\nA: You can run a version of PureDarwin that corresponds to MacOS 10.5 under an emulator under Linux or Windows. This is the core Unix operating system, and does not include the Mac OS UI or tools.\nIf you are in IT Support at a site that uses Macs, you should have one. It's just not feasible to support them competently without access to testing things out.\nI'm not sure what the purchasing policies are there. Are they personally owned computers that people are using? If they are university-supplied, surely there's a closet somewhere with old machines that you could grab one from.\n\nA: You can rent a hosted Mac for a single day commercially and be official and licensed. The three commercial offers below can supply M1 as well as Intel systems for rent.\n\n*\n\n*https://macminicolo.net/\n\n*https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/\n\n*https://www.macstadium.com/\nLeasing and counting on a high resale value also can be attractive if you believe you need more than a few days to perform your evaluation.\n", "Q: Can I use the RAM from my new MacBook Pro in my 4-year-old MacBook Pro? I just bought an i7 MBP with 4GB RAM. I'm upgrading it to 8GB with this: http://www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=8C4DD5E1A5CA7304\nSo I'll have the brand-new 4GB RAM I'm removing. Can I put it in my old MBP? Here are the specs of the old one:\nModel Identifier: MacBookPro2,2\nProcessor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo\nProcessor Speed: 2.16 GHz\nNumber Of Processors: 1\nTotal Number Of Cores: 2\nL2 Cache: 4 MB\nMemory: 3 GB\nBus Speed: 667 MHz\n\n\nMemory:\nMemory Slots:\nECC: Disabled\nBANK 0/DIMM0:\n  Size: 2 GB\n  Type: DDR2 SDRAM\n  Speed: 667 MHz\n  Status: OK\nBANK 1/DIMM1:\n  Size: 1 GB\n  Type: DDR2 SDRAM\n  Speed: 667 MHz\n  Status: OK\n\n\nA: No, you can't. The largest DIMMs the 2.2 will take are 2GB ones, and it can't address more than 3GB, so it's already maxed out: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/inside-the-macbook-pros-3gb-ram-limitation/321\n\nA: In addition to what Mike Scott said (you're already at the maximum), the RAM from your new Mac is DDR3, while your old Mac uses DDR2, so the sticks probably won't even fit.\n", "Q: How can I create a gmail pop account in mac mail in Mac OS 10.6.6 I have enabled pop at gmail and successfully used it on other PCs. \nOn my mac (10.6.6) I go into Mail, I press the + to create a new account. There is no option to choose the Account Type anymore. Just the Name, email addr, and password. If I put in my gmail address, it just defaults to imap. I don't see a way to change it to pop anywhere.\nI want to use pop as a way to backup my gmail to my mac.\nHow can I create a pop account for gmail?\n\nA: Mail searches an online database to see how to connect to an account; it defaults to IMAP for GMail because that can work better than POP, but you can override it later.  Tell Mail.app not to take the account on line immediately, then edit the account to switch it from IMAP to POP.\n(Personally, I'd switch GMail to IMAP instead.)\n\nA: The only way I could convince Mail to show me the screen where I could change the account type was to put in a bogus non-gmail email address (literally the string bogus). This way, it can't automatically setup anything. Then, it will bring you to the screen to manually configure, where you can set the account type, configure the other gmail pop settings, and uncheck the \"take account online\" checkbox.\nAfter it's created the account, edit the account settings and put in the real email address. Also, go in the advanced tab and uncheck \"remove copy from server...\".\n\nA: Hello you may want to try the following: When adding the NEW ACCOUNT add the:\n FULL NAME\n EMAIL ADRESS\n PASSWORD \nBefore pressing the create button press the alt key, it will change the Create button to Continue and there you can set the account to POP or whatever setting you may want different from the default IMAP that Mail.app uses.\nDont know why apple choose this hidden behavior to set mail settings, it took me some time to find it also. But at the end after all i went to an IMAP option since i need to sync across multiple devices .\n\nA: Go to \"Add other mail account\" where you will be able to set up as POP\n", "Q: Is there a comparison of networks and costs for iOS 4.3's Personal Hotspot? Is there a comparison of networks and their cost for the new Personal Hotspot feature?\nAlso, how does the hotspot feature differ from internet tethering in previous iOS versions?\n\nA: The hotspot feature is, in essence, very similar to the Internet Tethering feature. The differences are that a) there's no cable required and b) you can connect up to 3* wifi-capable devices, so you're not restricted to tethering only devices that have USB or Bluetooth.\n*See the below comments for the correct answer.\n\nA: Jeff Carlson, writing in TidBITS, has a comprehensive comparison of the Personal Hotspot fees in the US for AT&T and Verizon. Even for non-US users, I think the article will be useful for its discussion of how the feature works.\n\nA: Just jailbreak it and do it for free like most people have been doing for a few years now. MiWi works great!\n", "Q: Apple RAM for MacBook Pro vs other brands \nPossible Duplicate:\nApple-Certified RAM? \n\nApple RAM for the unibody MacBook Pro's typically has a large markup to it. I am wondering if it's different than Crucial or other brands in quality..\n\nA: I have also used Crucial memory in my MacBook Pros and have never had an issue with it.\nApple's support doc gives the memory specs to match against and does not require \"Apple\" RAM.\n\nA: No different from a brand like Crucial. In fact I have had the experience in the past of adding Crucial RAM to a Mac system and the system profiler reporting the exact same manufacturer code and part number for the new module as the already existing ones\n", "Q: Recall windows to the current space Is there a way to recall an app to the current space?\nThis is possible by turning Spaces off, but that recalls all apps. I just want one.\nSometimes a Safari URL gets opened, and since there is a Safari window open on some desktops somewhere, there it goes. It takes a few minutes to find where the link opened. If I could just recall the browser to the current space, it would be nice.\n\nA: I don't know how to fetch that window to the current space, but if you switch to the appropriate space where that window is located, you can click on the window title and while holding down the mouse button, press control + 1 to return that window the first space (or hold down control + whatever number space you want to drag it to).\n\nA: I'm not aware of any gathering feature. You can quickly move windows between spaces by activating it with the F6 key (or whatever you've set it to in Exposé & Spaces Preferences) to display all of them at once and, in that mode, drag windows from one space to another, pressing F6 again to return to normal viewing.\n", "Q: iPod touch 4G internal microphone? Based on the specs page, Apple seems to indicate that the 4th gen iPod touch has an internal microphone. Is this true, or are they merely indicating its compatibility with the headphones-with-remote-and-mic?\n\nA: It has a microphone. It is the little hole beside the back camera (no idea why they put it there).\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for minimizing Mac OS X windows? Is there a (hidden) keyboard shortcut for minimizing the frontmost window (that works in most apps)?\n\nA: ⌘+M works in most applications.\n", "Q: What is the most reliable ATSC TV tuner for use with OSX? I'm looking for an OTA (over the air, eg. no cable) ATSC USB tuner to use with a Macbook. There appear to be a few options, all of which seem to have ugly hardware and buggy software. Does anyone have a recommendation? Elgato seems like the biggest manufacturer, but I'm reading mixed reviews.\nI would primarily be using this in the US.\n\nA: I have an Elgato EyeTV 250, and it works great. I think Elgato may be the best (if not the only) option.\n", "Q: unzipping split zip files named filea, fileb, filec, file1, file2,  I got my first mac today and Im really going crazy trying to do something quite simple\nI have some split zip files called\nsomefilea.zip somefileb.zip    somefilec.zip somefiled.zip ... to     z.zip somefile1.zip somefile2.zip ...\nI'm trying to merge these into the same folder and let the files they contain join into one folder.\nI've tried app \"the unarchiver\" for this but I failed. It kept making new folders for every part.\nIs there an unzip tool in which I can do this? \nOn windows I'd select them all, right-click, select \"extract\" in the winrar menu and it would do what I want.\n\nA: I managed to do it with StuffIt expander\nI did have to click \"merge\" and \"skip\" 32 times but it eventually did the trick..\n\nA: If you open Terminal (in Applications > Utilities), you can use unzip from the command line.\nThis Macworld article tells how to change preferences for the Archive Utility (10.6 is the same), but there doesn't seem to be a setting to stop it from creating a new directory for the unarchived files.\n", "Q: How can I check the health of my SSD disk I replaced my disk with an SSD. Smooth transition, everythng fine. Now, I want to keep the disk health checked, since I know that SSD tend to degrade over time. Which utilities can I use for this task ?\n\nA: DiskTester from diglloydTools and its \"Recondition\" seems like one of the only options.\n\nA: there is no one way to diagnose this info because it depends on the controller type used in the SSD. It is possible that the vendor for your controller or the manufactureer of the controller chip have released software, and this is where you should look. What might they tell you? Summary:\nan SSD (made with NAND Flash) is composed of \"blocks - each one from 4k to 16k usually - that add up to the amount your SSD can hold. Each block can be erased or read from all it once, (although it is possible to write them little bits at a time) but only a certain number of times. It is common to see NAND that has 5,000 to 10,000 times it can be erased. That doesn't sound like a lot (when we are used to talking about gigabytes and gigahertz) but the way in which the SSD writes data to itself - called \"wear leveling\" - can make this 5k to 10k last a very long time. \nThe only metric worth measuring becomes how many times each cell has been written to (and which cells are dead altogether, which controllers expect and anticipate),  but because each controller is different how to get that number (if possible) and what that number means in terms of percent depleted becomes a highly specific question.\nBottom line, ask your manufacturer for diagnostic tools.\n", "Q: Can I use Automator or some other method to extract EXIF GPS data from batches of photos on my Mac? I need a way of extracting EXIF GPS data, using my Mac, from a bunch of photos taken on an iPhone.  So for example, if I put 1000 photos into a folder, I want an easy way of extracting all the GPS data for each photo into a text file.\nA solution which gets me close will probably be good enough.  I've looked at Automator but don't see a built in way to do what I need.  I have Aperture, iPhoto and Photoshop CS4 on my Mac in case someone knows a way of incorporating those applications.\n\nA: With Commandline tools this is easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew\n\n*brew install exiftools  in the Terminal\n\n*find ~/Pictures/ -iname '*.jpg' -print  -exec exiftool -DateTimeOriginal -GPSLatitude -GPSLongitude {} \\; in the Terminal\n\n\nA: There are a number of CLI utilities and scripting libraries available in Fink, MacPorts, and Homebrew available to extract and manipulate EXIF data.\n\nA: exiftool can also be used to generate a GPX file which can be processed by other GPX-aware programs. You can download the gpx.fmt template from the exiftool website:\nexiftool -p ./gpx.fmt *JPG > output.gpx\n\nSome useful options:\n\n\n*\n\n*-if makes exiftool only process files with a gps tag,\n\n*-fileOrder allows processing in a forced order,\n\n*-d allows formatting the datatime string.\n\n\nFor example:\nexiftool -if '$gpsdatetime' -fileOrder gpsdatetime -p ./gpx.fmt -d %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ *JPG > output.gpx\n\n", "Q: Camtasia, Screenflow, or \"Other?\" I want to start recording professional quality screencasts on my Mac and I've narrowed it down to two apps (that I know of): Camtasia Studio and Screenflow. I considered Camstudio, but since I will be doing this professionally and frequently, I would much rather pay a premium for a well-designed and fully-featured app. Which brings me to my question: \n\nIs there a clear winner between\n  Camtasia and Screenflow, or perhaps a\n  third, better app, that I haven't\n  listed?\n\nAs an additional and partly related question:\nFor post-production video / audio editing, an example of the editing I would be doing is: adding small tweaks and transitions, adding basic graphics like captions/dialog boxes, and possibly doing video inside a video (a scaled down video of me talking, synced with and placed somewhere on top of the screencast video). This brings me to my second question:\n\nWill either of the screencast apps be\n  able to handle these post-production\n  edits, or will I have to invest in\n  additional software that specializes\n  in video/audio editing like\n  Soundbooth or Final Cut?\n\n\nA: Both Camtasia Studio and Screenflow are full-featued screencasting solutions. Both allow you to capture, edit, and distribute screencasts. In the US at least, they cost the same (though Camtasia has a $99 \"introductory price,\" I would be surprised if they raise it to the $149 \"list price\" as long as Screenflow is priced at $99).\nBoth programs have extensive editing capabilities, and will handle the kind of edit tasks you describe.\nOne (minor, in my opinion) difference is that Camtasia allows you to capture part of the screen, while Screenflow always captures the whole screen. But it's easy to crop to part of the screen in Screenflow during the post-recording edit.\nIt boils down to which program's interface and workflow you prefer. Both have free trial versions; I suggest you download both and produce a sample video in each. Then buy the one that feels right for your working style.\n\nA: ScreenFlow can do all the basics, and it works well. You can download a free trial as well before buying to make sure it meets your needs (http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm).\n\nA: I have used Snapz Pro X in the past. $69 from Ambrosia Software. They do have a trial so you can try it.\nUnfortunately, I have not sought or used the features you are describing, so I can't say if Snapz Pro X will do all of what you asked. I just wanted to point out that there was a (possible) third alternative.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: iTunes Home Sharing: Shares Entire Library Instead of Selected Playlists I have my master iTunes library on a Mac Mini, and I set up Home Sharing to stream my music and videos to my MacBook Pro.  When I had iTunes 9, I selected certain playlists to share and not others, and things worked fine.  When I upgraded to iTunes 10, now the entire library shows up on the MacBook Pro.  But I still only want the selected playlists.\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've gone into Preferences and double-checked that I'm only sharing selected playlists.\n\n*I've quit iTunes on both machines and re-launched it.\n\n*I've turned off Home Sharing on both machines, then turned it back on.\n\n*I've switched the setting on the Mac Mini to \"Share my entire library\", applied the change, then switched it back to \"Share selected playlists\" and applied the change.\n\n*I've right-clicked different playlists on the Mac Mini and verified that Share is unchecked when desired.  But it still shows up on the MacBook Pro\n\n\nI'm using iTunes 10.2.1, so it's the current version.\nSo: how can I convince iTunes on the Mac Mini not to share only the playlists I've selected?\n\nA: Confusingly, the Sharing preferences have no effect on Home Sharing, which is a separate sharing mechanism altogether.\nThe main advantage of Home Sharing is that it allows copying from one Library to another; the disadvantage is that as yet, you don't get to control which playlists are shared.\n", "Q: Anything in iOS 4.3 for the iPhone 3GS? I was reading up on the update and it seems that most changes are for either iPad2 or iPhone 4 (e.g. the personal hotspot).\nIs there anything in this update for the iPhone 3GS?  Any performance improvements? Any reason to install it?\n\nA: Personal Hotspot (using bluetooth or USB, but not WiFi).\n\nA: Major javascript performance upgrade (over twice as fast), airplay in 3rd party applications, streaming music from iTunes through home sharing.\n\nA: I just updated to 4.3.1 yesterday and so far I'm not impressed. My phone is jailbroken though so I already have tethering with MyWi (side note, MyWi On Demand is totally worth the $25 if you have a jailbroken iPod or non-3G iPad). The multi-tasking gestures are pretty cool once you go through the hassle of re-enabling them.\nThe home sharing is pretty cool, but requires iTunes to be open. You can use the free Audiogalaxy app to do the same thing without iTunes being open on 4.2 and other iOS versions.\nSafari does seem to be a little quicker and the phone itself doesn't seem any slower, so unless you care about an unlock or jailbreak (it is now jailbroken but still annoying to reinstall all your Cydia apps after upgrading), I don't really see any compelling reason to upgrade or stay on 4.2 unless you need one of the new features and can't find an acceptable work-around or third-party solution.\nIf you like messing with your phone, do it but you're not missing out on anything spectacular not in 4.2.1.\n", "Q: Updating iPad- Error message: \"Could not start session with iPad\" When I try to update my iPad from my Win 7 desktop, I get this error message which says Could not start session with iPad and then the iPad disconnects.\nEven during normal syncing I have noticed that my iPad disconnects a few seconds after doing the backup. It's for this reason that I have never been able to do a full sync of my iPad.\nNote that the same usb cable/port works just fine for syncing/updating my iPhone 4.\nI even tried reinstalling my Apple USB drivers as mentioned here but to no avail.\n\nA: Several things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Soft reset your iPad by holding the power button and home button at the same time for a few seconds. The iPad will reboot. You won't lose your files so don't worry. When it completely boots up, try the sync again.\n\n*If the problem persists, then you may try to use iTunes to restore the OS. Be cautious when using this method because you may lose data. Maybe you should try syncing on another PC/Mac computer before you do this restore:\n\n\nConnect your iPad to your Windows 7 (cancel sync if you know it won't go through), then click your iPad in the \"device\" list; Press the restore button and follow the prompts. \n\nA: Last time I had a similar error the connector in my iPhone was blocked by a small \"stone\". \nI could see that the plug was no longer fitting \"perfectly\".\nAfter I cleaned it with a small piece of plastic it worked perfectly again. \nBefor you continue searching for software errors - can you confirm that your connector fits fine and is clean?\n", "Q: Can I combine the address bar and the Google search bar in Safari? The only reason I am using Chrome over Safari is the cool feature Chrome has namely the address bar acts as the search bar as well. Is there a way I can enable this feature in safari as well?\n\nA: Unless you want the Google-suggestions to appear, too, I think you might be looking for the free (SIMBL) plug-in Keywurl.\n\nA: SafariStand also offers this functionality, using the same SIMBL hack as Keywurl.\nOn the face of it, the main advantage of Keywurl over SafariStand seems to be its backward compatibility with Sogudi extensions, which is why I would recommend following Asmus' recommendation and use Keywurl.\nOn the more general point of browser selection, I switched from Safari to Google Chrome for the alleged speed improvement, smarter tab behaviour and search-in-addressbar functionalities. The two last functionalities seem more robust in Chrome than Safari to me (not sure about speed).\n", "Q: is there free OS X equivalent to Total Commander? is there free equivalent to Total Commander for OSX?\n\n\n*\n\n*two panels\n\n*drag & drop \n\n*tabs\n\n*etc ect\n\n\nI found DoubleCommander the best but OSX port has its bugs. muCommander is nice too but not as good as DoubleCommnader.\n\nA: TotalFinder became a commercial solution not long ago: the full beta development stage was free and gave me plenty of time to test the software. It's an excellent solution, and I have seen almost every single bug disappear progressively.\nEven if not a free solution anymore, its source is available on GitHub. I would recommend it on the grounds that it already works wonderfully well, and definitely deserve some support in my (otherwise freeware-oriented) opinion.\nIf freeware is yet a compulsory feature for you, Geekosaur's link has a few options.\nEdit, 2013-01-07: as mentioned in another answer, XtraFinder looks like TotalFinder, but free.\n\nA: Try XtraFinder. Is like TotalFinder, but it's free\n\nA: I am satisfied with Forklift. Although it costs $20 after trial period, it is a simple yet powerful replacement of Finder/Total Commander.\nWhat I value the most over other alternatives: \n\n\n*\n\n*Simple and clear UI: power is under the hood\n\n*Easy switch between 1 or 2 panels (mostly I use only one)\n\n*Option to setup shortcuts: Enter to open file, backspace to move up\n\n*Regular Expression for filters\n\n*Renaming multiple files\n\n*Sync folder: showing added/deleted/modified files\n\n*WebDav is much faster then in Finder\n\n\nSee http://www.binarynights.com for all features and screenshot. \n\nA: Path Finder or TotalFinder, perhaps?  (Both are commercial.)\n\nA: I'm writing an app similar to total commander, Mover - http://themaninhat.com/mover\n\nA: You should probably take a look at Disk Order. It was created as a Total Commander equivalent for OS X. http://likemac.ru/english\nHowever it's not free either...\n\nA: DCommander is a good alternative but it is not free.\nSee http://www.devstorm-apps.com/dcommander-mac/ or itunes directly: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dcommander/id583622672?mt=12\n\nA: FastCommander supports all file operations. Fast, stable, small, lightweight.\nCan be freely downloaded and used - no restrictions, just nag screen.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to mount a webpage? My professor requires me to go to the website and login and check the individual folders for updates. It is using http and I am wondering if there is a way to mount it as a drive similar to SSH and macfusion.\n\nA: You can't mount a http/https server as a filesystem since it won't provide a directory table for you. (I left a comment on why httpfs isn't what you need)\nThe best way to do the task is to make a list of the URLs you need to check and use a shell script (run from Automator for convenience perhaps?)\nYou will need to USE curl or wget which will do the http downloading for you (they both provide post and http basic auth support for sending login info, however you probably need to install them on Mac Os X, off the top of my head I've forgotten.)\nYou can get fancy and use diff to check automatically for changes in the files, so that you only need to get personally involved with the process when you really have to.\nNeed more info, I'll happily expand on this.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wget and Curl\n\n*Diff\n\nA: http://httpfs.sourceforge.net/\nThe webpage doesn't appear to have been updated since September 2006, but the downloads area has a release from a year ago.  Source code only, but reported to work on 10.4+.  You'll also need to install MacFUSE.\n", "Q: Why is there a duplicate entry for my TextMate? I was changing the default program to open .txt files with and I noticed 2 entries for TextMate. Its one of those little things that annoy me. How can I fix it? I didn't see 2 directors of TextMate.app in /Applications.!\n\n\nA: Mac OS X automatically keeps a database of all applications and their corresponding file-types called the LaunchServices database. You can examine where both of your TextMate executables are located by opening Terminal.app from /Applications/Utilities and entering:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump |  /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/mate\n\nThis will open a long file full of all Applications that your LaunchService DB \"knows\" on your Mac in TextMate. Examine this file for the \"path:\" of your duplicate entires of \"TextMate\". \nIt´s quite likely that you´ve already removed the second \"TextMate\" but your LaunchServices still remembers it. I guess you should tell the Datatbase to rebuild by entering:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\ninto the Terminal and then restarting your computer. This may lead to your Mac forgetting some custom \"open with..\" assignments though.\n\nA: Or, it could mean that you have two different versions of TextMate installed.

Throw the old one in the trash and you should be good to go.\nI get the same thing with Numbers as I still have the '09 and '10 versions installed... :)\nPiko\n", "Q: Is there a way to purchase an app from the Mac App Store as a gift? Is there a way, in the Mac App Store, to buy an app and to give the license to a friend who has no way to pay for that app?\n\nA: No, Apple didn't implement the gift feature in the Mac App Store. I imagine it will happen eventually, but it isn't there right now.\nYour only option would be to buy your friend an iTunes gift card, which can be used to buy apps.\nHere's my source\n\nA: I have not seen the option to gift apps in the Mac App Store like you are able to do for apps on iOS devices and in iTunes. However a workaround you could use would be to get your friend an iTunes gift card to cover the cost of the app. The Mac App Store uses the same accounts you would use to purchase content from iTunes or the AppStore on an iOS device.\nIf your friend does not have a credit card to set up an account, it is possible to set up an account without a credit card. To set up an account without a credit card. All you have to do is attempt to download a free application from the Mac App Store (this works in iTunes and on iOS devices as well), when prompted to sign in, click on the button that says \"Create an AppleID\". This will take you to a page to enter your email and choose a password, security question, etc.. After filling in that information, the next page is the where you enter your payment info. The section where you choose your Payment Type will have an option for none (This \"None\" option will not appear unless you attempt to download a free application and then create your AppleID). On that page you can also redeem the gift cards, promos etc. Hope this works for your friend\n\nA: If you love them a lot, you can log into your account from their computer, download the app, and then after the app has installed, log out of your account by going to the Store < Sign out.\nIt worked for giving my little sister FaceTime.  :)\n", "Q: Disable Safari plugin without (re)moving the file I've been Flash-free in Safari (5.0.3, my primary browser) for a while now, using Chrome with its bundled Flash Player whenever I have to.\nI'm also developing a little bit in Flash for school, and have ended up using the Flash Debug Player, since it's really convenient to use trace for debugging.\nI tried just putting the Debug Player inside my Google Chrome.app, similar to how the existing Flash Player is located, but Chrome refused to detect this, so I had to put it in /Library/Internet Plug-ins, and now Safari detects it too.\nIs there any way I can get Safari to ignore this plugin, or something that makes sure Chrome can find it, and not Safari?\n\nA: Maybe just use the clicktoflash extension (also available from Safari Extensions Gallery)?\n\nA: You have to rename the Flash debug plugin, in order to be available to Chrome.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to 'Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/10.0.../Internet Plug-ins' \n\n*delete the 'Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin'\n\n*put there your debug 'Flash Player.plugin'\n\n*rename it to 'Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin'\n\n*restart Chrome\n\n", "Q: If I install more RAM should I boot into 64bit Kernel?

I prefer to install each OS on its own partition and be able to boot it without virtualization or to boot it virtualized while I am under OS X.\nThe question is what virtualization solution does support this. Please answer only if it worked for you and also include some guidances. \nSo for, I was able to boot Ubuntu VM using Parallels, but I was not able to add a real  partition to VM under VirtualBox or VMware Fusion.  \n\nA: I've used raw disk access under VMWare Fusion.  It's less than intuitive, but it works.  The helper app (and google-fodder) is /Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/vmware-rawdiskCreator.\nImportant: Consider this a \"from-memory, basic idea of what the process requires\", rather than a howto - please do google for \"fusion vmware-rawdiskcreator\" to find a proper walkthrough if you choose to go this route.  I can't promise my memory is accurate enough to trust your partitions to.\nThe biggest catch is that it won't find the partition unless it's been previously booted with Boot Camp, or you've used rEFIt's partitioning tool to sync the MBR. vmware-rawdiskCreator reads the partition list from the MBR, which isn't otherwise kept in sync with the GPT  (bios partition tables vs EFI partition tables).\nTry:\n$ /Library/Application\\ Support/VMware\\ Fusion/vmware-rawdiskCreator print /dev/disk0\nNr      Start       Size Type Id System                   \n-- ---------- ---------- ---- -- ------------------------\n 1          1  976773167 BIOS EE Unknown\n\n(disk0 is your first disk).  If you get similar results to mine (one big partition type'd BIOS), you don't have the MBR synced with GPT.  rEFIt (refit.sf.net) is my preferred way to do this, but bootcamp will do it for OSes it supports.\nIf you do get a list of usable partitions, you then need to create a vmdk (VMware's disk format) pointing to the right partition.  This is done with\n$ sudo /Library/Application\\ Support/VMware\\ Fusion/vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk0 n Filename lsilogic\n\nWhere /dev/disk0 is the physical disk containing the partition, n is the partition number listed by the first command (print /dev/disk0), and Filename is what you want to call the resulting disk image.\nYou can then change ownership of the two files it creates (Filename.vmdk and Filename-pt.vmdk), and use them as existing disk images when creating a VM.\nNot so straight-forward :) It does work though; I've used this method to install linux on a machine that has a dead optical drive.\n", "Q: How to draw a curved arrow in Keynote 09?

They list two variants that differ $400 in price. As far as I can tell, these are the only differences between them.\n\n\n*\n\n*2.0 GHz i7 processor ($1800 version) vs 2.2 GHz i7 processor ($2200 version)\n\n*500 GB hard drive ($1800 version) vs 750 GB hard drive ($2200 version)\n\n*6490M (with 256MB GDDR5) graphics card ($1800 version) vs 6750M (with 1GB GDDR5) graphics card ($2200 version)\n\n\nOption #2 doesn't make a huge difference to me, so my question is this: for what types of applications will the difference processors have an observable effect in performance? For which types of applications will the different graphics cards have an observable effect in performance?\n\nA: This question is so subjective because there is nothing specific being asked. Let me break it down for you.\nHow much does the move from 2.0 GHZ to 2.2 GHZ improve performance?\n200 MHz is the obvious answer here. Improve performance, depends, chances are you probably won't notice any difference in that aspect.\nHow about the different graphics cards?\nObvious difference being the 768MB difference in memory in the cards. Subjective because who knows what your use is going to be, i can tell you for browsing/email/office type products you'll never see the difference. \nAre these improvements limited to certain types of applications?\nWhat certain type of applications? Once again how can you answer this if you don't give anybody a specific area/application that you plan on using.\nWhat do I need to keep in mind when comparing these specs?\nKeep in mind in terms of what? Obviously you know the cost difference and some of the numerical differences, but what is it that you are actually asking here?\nSorry if this comes off harsh, but it's too vague and subjective right now to give you any type of concrete answer.\n\nA: If you will use your mac for daily basis (not programming CUDA or compilers or so) then you will not feel the difference at all. Investing in better equipment especially in CPU will pay off when your mac will get older (>3yrs?). At that point it will still have a value for you.\nI have 4yrs old 2.6GHz Core Duo and it still works great for me (I use it all the time). It was investment for me, because I calculated that if I save only a 30 minuts a week by faster program compilation the money are worth it (3.5k$ at that time).\nI have 3yrs macbook 2.0GHz and it starts to be clumsy. \nIt is limited by the performance of the memory subsystem.\nThe question therefore is if the 400$ spending now will have value for you after 2-3 years? If you think that you will replace the computer earlier then do not bother. \n\nA: The two processors Seem to be:\nhttp://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=50067\nhttp://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=52219\nand the differences are more than just clock speed - the faster one also has faster memory bandwidth, along with plain old 'more features' such as VT-d Virtualization for directed IO, Execute disable, Quicksync video, wireless display, mywifi, 4G wimax... but what it means for those things to have built in support in the CPU, I don't know.\nI'd predict that the memory bandwidth, which is about 20% higher in the faster chip, would have more of an observable effect than the 10% faster CPU, but that unless you have an intensive use planned the difference wont be worth much worrying about.\nFar better to look at an SSD instead of a normal hard disk, that will provide a big shift in the feel of how responsive everything is - the hard disk is the biggest bottleneck in normal computers these days. (Where a hard disk can shift 20-40Mb/s sustained, an SSD can shift 100-200Mb/s sustained. Where a hard disk can handle 100 operations per second, an SSD can handle many hundreds or a few thousands).\nFor which types of applications will the different graphics cards have an observable effect in performance?\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphics heavy games, racing and running around shooting, flying and the like (not cards, dice, board, web/flash games, etc).\n\n*Graphics heavy apps like architecture modelling, 3D scene rendering, Pixar style film rendering.\n\n*Currently niche apps which make use of the graphics card as a spare processor - at the moment this means things like distributed computing project SETI@Home, and PowerDirector 7 video encoding software. However, there is a push in the industry to make this more widespread, but that's probably still too far away from every day uses to bother about for another year or three.\n\n\nMy vote is that unless you have a particular intensive workkload or unusual use which you haven't mentioned, the 2.0Ghz will be fine, and if you can spare the money then see if you can find a machine with a good SSD to compare, and consider one as an upgrade, for an everyday snappiness boost.

So, What will happen if I restore my iPhone from itunes?\n\nA: Your iPhone will return to factory settings as if you had a new iPhone.\n", "Q: Deleting a user account from a OSX machine Is the best way to delete a users information on a macbook pro just to do a clean reinstall or is it safe to just delete the user account from the machine?\n\nA: It is safe to just use the System Preferences -> Accounts dialog to delete the user account. You always have to have one active account on the machine. You will need administrator access to the machine to delete the account. When you delete an account you'll be asked if you want to save the account's home directory or just delete them. Up to you which way you go there.\nNow, if the user had administrator access to the machine, deleting their account may not remove all traces of the user from the machine. If they installed software in to /Applications or made system-level changes via /Library or any other means, those changes are going to persist on the machine. But if they weren't a privileged user, everything they could have changed on the machine was in their home directory and deleting their account got rid of it.\nIf you want to get rid of any trace a privileged user may have left on a machine you can delete the user account and then roll back to a point in time using your TimeMachine drive when that user didn't exist. Or, before deleting the user account, you can find all files that are owned by that user and manually deal with the ones that fall outside the user's home directory, then delete the user account. Or you can reinstall the entire OS -- but frankly that seems like a sledge hammer for a nail type of solution to me.\n\nA: Delete the account with the Accounts system preference pane, then run Disk Utility's Erase Free Space function (the Zero Out Deleted Files option is sufficient) to remove leftover traces of the user's files.\n\nA: In the past I've gone through System Preferences > Accounts to save their home folder as a disk image (or just delete the home folder outright) and ensure all of the OS stuff that needs to get done gets done (just in case there is any), and then simply trash the disk image.\n", "Q: Restore from backup on iPod touch issues Here's the story:\nI recently tried to update my iPod touch 4th Gen. to iOS 4.3. I did make a backup yesterday at 6:30PM, then I clicked update in iTunes. That's when everything went to hell.\nThe first update didn't work. There was an error (I don't remember the exact error) and the update failed. I could still use my iPod, but none of my apps would open. I tried the update again and, after some more trouble, it seemed to work. However this time I couldn't get to my music. It said \"You must sync your iPod with iTunes first before you can use Music.\"\nI tried this, but no matter how many times I synced, this problem would not go away. So I figured I would just restore it from my backup. This doesn't work. I keep getting this error: \"Could not restore because the backup failed.\" It says this for every backup.\nI've tried completely restoring the iPod to both 4.3 and 4.2 and nothing works.\nIt seems to me like there is a communication issue between the iPod and my (crappy) PC. When I click \"restore from backup\" this weird little window pops up in iTunes with an indefinite progress bar. Its title is \"Restoring from backup\" and under the progress bar it says \"Estimating time remaining.\" The real interesting part is that the iPod is unaffected. It doesn't change to the \"Restore in Progress\" screen or \"Sync in Progress\" or anything.\nI'm really at a loss here. \n\nA: With iOS devices there are a lot of issues that can be happening between iTunes and the iPod. Backups can take a very long time depending on the amount of application data or the size of the camera roll at the time of the backup. Troubleshooting these issues go from very simple troubleshooting steps such as updating iTunes and restarting your computer all the way to the more advanced troubleshooting steps. If you are getting an error code, this can help you determine the exact issue, there is a really great article for troubleshooting the iPod on apples support site @ http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1275 \nSome steps that you can take to help isolate the issue would be trying a different USB cable (if you have one) or different USB port (should be USB 2.0), if you are connecting to USB through USB hub or extender try plugging it directly in to the computer, creating a test windows user account can also save a lot of headaches by letting you know it is something specific to that user account, and trying to sync music on another computer. I would try walking through that article and if your still having issues after that to try contacting apple or setting up an appointment at an apple store to make sure there is nothing wrong with the actual hardware of the iPod.

What is the complete list of iOS devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad) that are unable to update to iOS 4.3 or higher?\n\nA: According to Apple, (scroll to the bottom of the page) only the two most recent generations of each device can upgrade. So both iPads, the iPhone 4 and 3GS and the 3rd & 4th generation iPod touch. One exception: The CDMA (Verizon in the US) iPhone 4 is staying on 4.2.6 for a while. It has some, but not all, features of iOS 4.3.\nThat leaves the first two generations of iPod touch and the original iPhone and iPhone 3G unable to use it.\nThe 3G and second-generation iPod touch got stripped-down versions of 4.0-4.2.1. (No multitasking, homescreen wallpapers, or printing.) The other two devices left out (1st-gen iPod touch & iPhone) didn't even get 4.0.\n", "Q: Viewing dollar sign shares over Samba on OS X? I love Finder's built-in \"connect to server\" functionality. It's great, if not a bit hidden! (Those of you that don't know about it, right-click the Finder icon in your dock and hit Connect to Server) So I use it to connect to Windows shares on several computers; I type in the address of smb://computername and hit Connect, and it prompts me which shares I want to mount, and mounts them. It Just Works, as is typical of Mac.\nHowever, I know that on Linux, you can browse a server and see the shares that end in a $; these, of course, are supposed to be hidden (e.g. in Windows, you wouldn't ever see them) but Linux breaks through the illusion of security (or at least privacy) and shows them all.\nUnfortunately, using the Connect to Server method above, I am not able to see any dollar sign shares of my server. I know this particular server has about 20 shares ending in $, and yet I only see these few public shares.\n\nIs there a way to configure the OS X version of Samba to show these \"hidden\" shares?\n\nA: I'm not aware of a way to make them show in the list, but you could just type smb://servername/sharename$ in that box, if you know the name of the share.\nIn that initial Connect to Server window, you can also click the + icon to bookmark it in the list below the text field. That way, you don't have to type it every time.\nAlternately, if you have a bunch of them that you mount together, you can create an Automator script that will mount them for you, provided you know the share name for each. I wrote about that option in an answer to another question back in October.\n", "Q: Alternatives to, or benefits of, AppleCare for a MacBook Pro? I have a 17\" MacBook Pro. I bought it in November 2010, so it is still under the one-year warranty and thus I have the ability to buy AppleCare and extend the warranty. Thing is, I'm having second thoughts as to whether this is worth it, or if there are other third-party warranty services that might be just as good at parts replacement for a lower cost.\nEveryone I've talked to has touted AppleCare as being great, just walk into the Apple store and they help you with anything, etc. etc. But I can say pretty confidently that I'm never going to have a software question for the people at the Apple store. So I guess the only thing I would ever use it for is if there is a hardware issue with my MacBook Pro. Is this worth buying AppleCare for?\nWhat are my options in this regard, and what else would I get from AppleCare that I might care about?\n\nA: In general, extended warranty plans are a healthy-sized profit center for the company offering them.  This implies that unless a product turns out to be less reliable than predicted, on average (mean average) customers will be better off paying for their own repairs without the warranty.  However, if one can't afford to self-insure for abnormal or even normal deviations from the average, something like AppleCare will lessen the downside financial risks.\nThus, I suggest (and buy) AppleCare only if an Apple product seems to be getting numbers of reports of below average reliability (e.g. the Duo 2xx and PowerBook 5x00 product lines).  For other Apple products, maybe put the money in a savings account instead, and there is a good likelyhood that you'll end up ahead after a decade or two of Apple products.\n\nA: AppleCare is totally worth the money. Case in point: I recently had to take my older MacBook Pro in for service. It seemed I qualified for that Nvidia video card recall (the one where they shipped cards that died after a couple years of use), but never actually did anything about it. The card finally died on me and I had to take it in. \nWhile I was there, the tech noticed on my keyboard that one of the keys had the numbers worn off and I mentioned that another key had gone \"soft\" and wouldn't work every time. Because the laptop was under warranty, they replaced the card and the keyboard free of charge. \nI used to fix laptops way back in the day, and the keyboard was the worst because you typically had to take out the entire innards of the laptop to replace it. if laptop design is still the same, then that work was money in the bank as far as I'm concerned. My laptop is like new again.\n\nA: I always bought AppleCare for my MacBooks and I never regret it. If there was a problem (and in 2 of 3 cases there was), the support folks repaired my device without any problems. Even smaller problems (not working  key on the keyboard) are very expensive on a laptop, I think.\nAs I am writing from Europe, it is much cheaper to buy AppleCare via ebay.com (at least it was about two years ago), than to buy it in the online shop. And the alternatives... some resellers have their own warranty plan.

Is it safe to delete these files?\n\nA: These look like most of the (recursive) dependencies of GnuPG 2.x (except those that are likely included with the OS or the development tools: zlib bzip2, perl, curl, openssl, autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.).\nHere is a rough overview of the structure of those dependencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*libiconv: libcharset, libiconv\n\n*gettext: gettext, libasprintf, libgettextlib, libgettextpo, libgettextsrc, libintl\n\n*gpg-agent\n\n\n*\n\n*libassuan: libassuan\n\n\n*\n\n*pth: libpth\n\n*libgpg-error: libgpg-error\n\n\n*libksba: libksba\n\n*libgcrypt: libgcrypt\n\n\n*libusb-compat: libusb (0.1.4)\n\n\n*\n\n*libusb: libusb (1.0.0)\n\n\n\nI wonder if maybe they are from installable packages of the macgpg2 project (it even includes a charset.alias its iconv package).\nBesides /usr/local, these packages also write to these locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/start-gpg-agent.app/\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sourceforge.macgpg2.gpg-agent.plist\n\n*/private/etc/paths.d/MacGPG2\nNote: I only scanned through the Info.plist files and the BOMs from the packages, there may be other files elsewhere. Pacifist might be useful if you want to try to go through your /Library/Receipts/ entries to try to find all the files it might have installed.\n\nIf these all came from some installation of GnuPG, and you no longer need it (Homebrew only seems to have GnuPG 1.x, otherwise you could rebuild it yourself), then it is probably safe to delete the files. Though I would start /usr/local/ from scratch instead of just clearing lib and include (probably by mv /usr/local /usr/local.old like geekosaur mentioned).\n\nA: That's kinda the problem; Homebrew doesn't know what they are either, and randomly sourced libraries tend to break builds.  (MacPorts makes the same recommendation.  In fact, I was under the impression that was one of the things Homebrew relaxed.)\nIf you don't know what they are or if they're used, the simplest solution is\n$ sudo mv /usr/local /usr/local.keep\n\nand watch to see what breaks.  Chances are they're used by whatever's in /usr/local/bin, though, so look there first.\n", "Q: Options to use iPad as remote photo viewing client As it says here, I can use an iPad as a remote photo vieing client if I buy the WD My Book Live NAS. But I have an old NAS already and I wonder if there are any generic iPad apps that give similar function, but without restriction on a specific NAS?\nThanks.\n\nA: I use Remiew\nI can view any photo I saved on my PC from iPad as it gives full control on folder navigation, i.e. I can browse all folders of my pc without any restrictions.\nOne restriction it that it shows images only, no other file types are shown.\nIt was a bit tricky to set it up at first, but it works fine for me and it's free.\n\nA: Try using a free cloud storage solution such as dropbox.com or box.net. For example, you can install the Dropbox application on any of your PCs / Macs, and upload images to a folder. On your iPad, download the Dropbox app and you will see those files show up. \nThose solutions serve as an online NAS and it is free to use if you only use <1-2GB of storage space. Many other apps also support them so you can transfer files from and to your iPad.\n\nA: Soon, with iOS 5, the new 'Photostream' feature will more than likely fill this need for you:\nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html\n\nA: This app claims to view iPhoto libraries remotely, and this discussion suggests Zumocast and Plex for doing the same. It also implies Zumocast can show folders full of files.\nSeveral sites suggest publishing your photo folders as a website in Apache and browsing them in Safari on the iPad, with or without some kind of pleasant web front-end / gallery site.\n\nA: I use Cinq for this, it works fine on iPad and iPhone. You'll need to run the helper app on a Mac or PC, and it will drag the photos from your hard drive or NAS and display them.\nIt also allows you to send your photos wirelessly from your iPhone (and i guess iPad 2) to your Mac or PC.\nZumocast does something similar, but i preferred Cinq. It seems that Zumocast has suspended downloads for the moment, not sure what's going on.\n\nA: AirPhotoViewer Can lets you view photo form your pc over wifi with out sync  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airphotoviewer/id524118762?ls=1&mt=8 \n", "Q: How to enable the iOS spell checker in Mobile Safari? The iOS spell checker works for me in all the iOS applications, but it doesn't seem to work for text I type in a text area in Mobile Safari. For instance, spelling errors are underlined in red for emails I type in Mail, but they are not underlined in red in the web-based Gmail. I am not talking about completion feature, but the red underline of misspelled words, which is new with iOS 4, as shown in this screenshot:\n\nHow can I get spell checking to work for form fields in Mobile Safari like it works in other applications?\n\nA: It looks like it's indeed a hole in iphone's safari. I'm not sure if it was always like that or if it's a new undocumented feature that might soon go away.\nBut meanwhile you can try using Inspell if you're willing to jailbreak. There's just no other way to fix such an issue: it's either apple or cydia.\nAnother option, if the error occured only in safari, is using another browser. But that doesn't seem to be this case.\n\nA: I think that has more to do with the way that Google coded their website, than it does with the iPhone itself.\nSpell-check works everywhere else on the internet that I have seen while using my phone.\nIn fact, I just went on my phone and confirmed it works properly on a couple websites including the web version of Facebook.\nI would be sending a bug request to Google instead of posting here. That would be much more effective.\n\n\nA: On my iPad Air 2, iOS 9 (it goes back many revisions), I experience the same issue.\nI can only report that the situation is slightly different when you are talking mobile Safari on iPad.  No, words are not underlined in red in Safari, quite sadly. \nIt works exactly as you would want it to in Chrome on the iPad; However the iPhone 6s/ iOS 9 Chrome text entry experience seems to be exactly the same as that of Safari.  I guess that is due to different design paradigms and parameters, small screens, tiny keyboard, etc.  Highly assisted text entry, autocorrection, predictive text, etc. seem to be more important than underlining spelling errors.\nChrome's spell check works just like you would expect, but only when you're using an iPad.  This is what I have found in testing today.\n\n", "Q: Can a Mac Mini drive three monitors? I'm the owner of three Samsung SyncMaster 245BW monitors (resolution: 1920 x 1200). I'm interested in getting a Mac Mini and was wondering if I'll be able to connect the Mac Mini to all three monitors such that I can have a separate desktop on each. Does the Mac Mini come with the hardware / software to do this? Thanks!\n\nA: Alot depends on what Mac Mini you have. Early Mac Minis only had a single DVI out, later versions had mini DVI out, still newer versions had a mini DVI and a mini DisplayPort out, and the newest all metal version has a mini DisplayPort and HDMI out and comes with an HDMI to DVI adapter.\nNegrino was correct in saying that you could get a USB to DVI adapter but you might only have to get one of them, depending on your Mac Mini's video out ports. If you have an early G4 or Core Solo Mini, you would have to get 2 adapters.\nFor a little clarification, are you planning on mirroring your desktop 3 times or having 1 desktop extended over 3 monitors? If it is the first option then you could simply get a VGA or DVI Y adapter that would mirror the image coming out of one port to 2 or more monitors.\n\nA: I have exactly the setup you describe, with a 2010 Mac Mini, with three Samsung 245BWs even. The same setup will work with a 2011 Mini as well. Just don't get anything older.\nIn my rig, one monitor is connected to the Mini's mini-DisplayPort port (with a mini-Displayport to HDMI cable), one is connected to the Mini's HDMI port (with an HDMI-DVI adapter), and the third is connected using a DisplayLink USB dongle of dubious Chinese manufacture.\nAll three run at the monitor's default 1920x1200 resolution. The two 'real' connections are fast and great for video and games, but the USB one is noticeably slower for video, so I deliberately use that one for e-mail, web, iTunes, and all those other 'on the side' applications.\nThe same would work with a 2011 (current) Mini, just sub in \"Thunderbolt port\" for mini-DisplayPort above.\nWhen choosing a USB/HDMI adaptor, the key word you want is DisplayLink, and you must watch the specs VERY closely to be sure that 1920x1200 is supported. Many only work up to 1080, which is not quite enough. It took me three tries.\n\nA: You can use the Mac Mini's built-in Mini DisplayPort port for one monitor, and use a USB to DVI adapter like the $99 unit from IOGEAR for each of the other two. That may not be financially attractive, of course. There are several other units from other manufacturers that also claim to do the job, so shop around.\nIf the Samsung monitors have HDMI ports, you might be able to use the Mac Mini's HDMI output with them. Or possibly use an HDMI to DVI adapter.\n\nA: \"Mac Mini 2.3 GHz (Mid 2011):  Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics, supports only one one connected Apple Thunderbolt Display\nMac Mini 2.5 GHz (Mid 2011): Mac mini with AMD graphics can support an HDMI compatible device on its HDMI port when using two Thunderbolt displays.\nMac Mini (Late 2012): can use an HDMI-compatible device on it's HDMI port while using one Thunderbolt display, or they can use two Thunderbolt displays.\" \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219?viewlocale=en_US#dispnum\n\nA: I have a 2012 i7 Mac Mini with three displays, none of them mirrored. \nYou can read more in my review of the J5 Create USB adapter. It doesn't have a refresh speed like a native display using the iMac GPU but for web browsing or light productivity work, the lag drawing to the third screen is observable but acceptable. \n\nA: Updated info: if you get the current (2011) Mac Mini with AGP graphics (the higher-end version, not the one with built-in Intel graphics) it can drive three displays right out of the box: two from Thunderbolt and one from the HDMI port.\nNote footnote (3) on this page:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4885\n", "Q: What are some Textmate alternatives that have the completion key feature? I am slowly beginning to fear the worst with Textmate and the impending release of Lion and how stable Textmate might be on it.\nSo my question is, are there any Textmate alternatives out there that supports the completion feature (Esc key autocompleting) in the same way that Textmate does?\nIt must be as similar as possible to textmate implementation ideally.\nMeaning:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can autocomplete various language keywords, based on existing language\n\n*It can autocomplete nearby words. \n\n*It doesn't generate a dropdown showing options, you should just keep pressing the key to cycle through the options.\n\n\nA: The Cocoa build of Emacs 23 is very good and has a ton of extensions and virtually limitless scope for customisation.\nThe learning curve can be a bit steep, but it's well worth the investment in time once you get over the initial hump.\nIf you are comfortable with TextMate, the Terminal and these sorts of things, you will be fine, http://emacswiki.org is a great resource.\n\nA: Sublime Text 2 is proceeding nicely. Reminds me a lot of Textmate\nOverview: http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-public-alpha\nDownload for ver. 2: http://www.sublimetext.com/2\n\nA: One option is Smultron, which is available from the MacApp Store for 4,99. It offers exactly what you need (really good autocompletion). You find more information on it in the first comment on this post. There is also a free fork of it named Fraise. I didn't try Fraise yet, but it seems to be as good as Smultron.\nAnother option you have is Vim. But getting to Vim is not easy. If you are coming from TextMate I would recommend MacVim in combination with Janus. It is developed by Ex-TextMate guys that came to Vim and they did a really good job to provide some functionality that TextMate Users love. The Janus Page is btw. a good starting point for a Vim Transition.\n\nA: My guess is that TextMate will be updated for Lion so you should be just fine. Textmate has paying customers that expect to be able to use in on the latest version of OS X, and I don't see why the developers would risk losing customers by not updating their software.\nI would even go so far as to say that the update to Lion might be an ideal time for them to release TextMate 2.0. Admittedly, the release was named in 2009's top ten vaporware by Wired, but then again, so was Starcraft II. Let's cross our fingers because let's face it, TextMate is simply the best.\n\nA: Another recommendation for Sublime Text 2 (its in beta, but already more stable for me than Textmate ever was to have switched over to full-time).\nIt has a similar auto-complete behaviour to Textmate that you mentioned you needed, triggered by the tab key by default. However, it doesn't cycle through the different matches with this key - it actually just selects the best match. As pointed out by koiyu above, if you hit ctrl-space it will open the auto-complete drop-down with all the matches that you can choose from.\nMore info on its completion behaviour can be found here\nOther notable features if you are interested:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text is highly configurable. Everything from the default key-mappings mentioned for the auto-complete behaviour above, down to the colour of the tabs in the interface can be easily changed by modifying the JSON-format configuration files. A lot of things don't have a pretty GUI at the moment but it was easy enough for me to get in there and tweak everything I could possibly want -- ST is a tweaker's dream.\n\n*Textmate-compatibility. As an ex-Textmate user, I love that ST is compatible with Textmate snippets, language files and colour schemes. I couldn't find a CMake bundle in Sublime Text by default, so I just copied across the language file from the CMake bundle from Textmate and it worked perfectly.\nIt's definitely one to watch as development has been rapid.\n\nA: Vim seems to fit your requirements: http://code.google.com/p/macvim/\n\n\n*\n\n*See this: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip91 for dictionary completions\n\n*Ctrl-N autocompletes with the words in the files currently open\n\n*It does not generate a drop down menu, but you can add it as an option if you change your mind.\n\n\nIn addition to that it has macros support, syntax highlighting and many extensions.\n\nA: TextMate is probably the most awesome mac text editor, so I'm not sure you'll be able to find a better one. It's tagged at around $50 so, if you take that into consideration, there might be another one up to the challange - but I haven't tried it: BBedit costs $39 until October 2011, when it goes up to $49.\nHere are two editors I find quite amazing as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Text Wrangler - free and made by the same guys from BBedit, BareBones.\n\n*SubEthaEdit - simple and powerful its main feature is collaboration.\n\n\nI trust if none of those 3 satisfy your needs, you're in tough luck. But there are more alternatives.\n", "Q: How can I get Gmail Chat to run in background on my iPhone? For my iPhone, is there anyway to have gmail chat ping me, when a new chat occurs, and I am on another app?  Unlike Android or Blackberry, I am amazed that I have yet not found anything that works well on the iphone for chatting with friends.  Am I missing something here?  Or is this just one of the greatest overlooked features that my iPhone does not have.  \nAnd any solution offered can be either from the app store or cydia.  Thanks.\n\nA: Trillian for iPhone works great for this.  Supports push notifications and multiple other IM networks besides Google Chat.\n\nA: I'm a rather large fan of Beejive (iTunes Link). Supports push notifications, e-mail notifications, and server side idling up to 7 days without re-opening the app.\nThe (admitted) downside, is that the iPhone/iPad versions are different, not one universal app. For example, the above link is the iPhone ipa, and this is the iPad iTunes link.\n$10 each. But they don't get any better. High quality app, great feature set, no ads (go figure), highly recommended.\n\nA: You can try eBuddy for iPhone; signup then add your google account. It works the way you like.\n\nA: Answering your question, iOS 4 allows apps to run in the background, but that doesn't work the same way as on the desktops. Background running apps should use very low memory and will be purged as soon as enough apps need the memory in front of it. So what you really need is pushing chat notifications, which helps save your phone battery because it's less power intensive and handled by the system.\nNimbuz is another great free option that also supports voice calling, many IMs, push (from experience I think it lasts between 24 hours and 3 days top), and used to work even with skype voice. now there's no third party client that works with skype at all as far as I know.\nIt is my current favorite and I've tried many options, tho I haven't tried Trillian nor Beejive.\nFring is the first one for iPhone and is still great as well. It features video calling (between 2 frings). I prefer Nimbuzz because of little details, such as fring doesn't show from which protocol the specific profile is in the list.\nIn the end, the app you choose will be the best one for your personal taste, as there are plenty of good options.\n", "Q: How do I install Windows 7 without BootCamp and keep the OS X installation intact?

I do not want to destroy osx partition by mistake.\n\nA: You'll probably need to redo this setup and install Windows 7 before Ubuntu. I am pretty sure if you install Windows 7 it will take over the GRUB bootloader. There is an article on lifehacker that gives instructions on how to set this up http://lifehac.kr/ihVY4k\n\nA: I suggest that you use BootCamp for Windows 7, and virtualization for Ubuntu. Since Ubuntu requires so fewer system resources than Windows 7 or Mac OS X, your performance hit should be minimal, if noticeable at all.\nI would first destroy the BootCamp partition using the BootCamp Assistant, then recreate it and install Windows 7. Then install Ubuntu using one of the virtualization programs (VirtualBox, Parallels or VMWare).\n\nA: I think the best and more flexible solution would be to go to virtualization with VirtualBox, Parallels or VmWare. It will leave your OSX system intact. The drawback will be on the performance as you will have both systems running at the same time.\nI personnaly runs a Win7 with VirtualBox and I'm quite happy with it.\n", "Q: dont show unread mails from subfolders in Apple Mail when collapsed Expanded I see this:\n\nWhen I collapse the account, it shows the total unread count next to it:\n\nI don't want that. I just want to see the unread count of the actual inbox.\nIn outlook I can exclude subfolders when showing the count of a folder. Is this also possible in apple mail?\n\nA: I don't believe that it is possible to change the way unread message counts are aggregated. However, you can change your folders so that they are not displayed under your Inbox. That way your Inbox will only show the count for unread message in your Inbox.\n\nOn many mail servers, mailboxes are created and stored underneath the Inbox which is what you are seeing.\nINBOX\nINBOX.Drafts\nINBOX.Sent\nINBOX.Trash\nINBOX.Junk\nINBOX.Todo\n\nBy changing your account settings in Mail.app, you can specify the IMAP Path Prefix so that Mail will ignore the first part (INBOX) display these folders independently rather than subfolders of the Inbox.\nTo do this go to Mail -> Preferences -> Account and select the account in the left column. Then select Advanced on the right and you will see a text box to change the IMAP Path Prefix. Typically, you'll want to change this to INBOX, but this will depend on your mail provider (e.g. Google uses [Gmail]) so you may need to check with your provider.\n\n", "Q: How do I format a disk partition from the command line on OS X?

How do I keep my Battlehearts game when I get my new shiny?\nWhat I'm Not Asking:  Obviously, exchange data will migrate seamlessly to the new device upon provision of login credentials, and same goes (maybe without the \"seamlessly\") to data (music, video, etc.) associated with my iTunes account.\n\nA: I had this exact same problem and can answer specifically for Battleheart. I had started playing on iPhone but want to keep playing on my iPad. The developer was kind enough to respond to me and tell me how. \nThere is a file on your device var/mobile/applications/<Battleheart Folder>/library/preferences - it isn't encrypted and you can just copy it to the same location on your other device. \nYou don't have to jailbreak.

Also see this old TAO/OmniOutliner review at ATPM.\nI also sure would like to find a newsgroup/forum though...\n\nA: I just got Neo and have found it a trade off of money vs time. \nNeo has an incredible functionality to cost ratio (if it were the weight to power ration of aircraft, Neo would be rocket.) It's almost as capable as Omnioutliner Pro $99US while costing only $8-$10US. \nBut you just can't sit down and open up Neo and start outlining. You've got to fiddle with it a bit. Then to get the the more powerful features, you've go to explore and fiddle some more. \nUsing it is almost like playing a game in which, instead of unlocking levels or achievements, you learn how to use different features of the app.\nIf you are burning paid man hours, you could easily eat the cost differntial between OmniOutline and Neo before you got Neo to same level as Omni\nDetails:\nIt has a out of date, idiosyncratic interface and the documentation, though detailed, is oddly structured and phrased, probably because the developers of Neo are Japanese. You have to spend at lot of time fiddling with the app to get to the features. \nIdiosyncrasy example: It doesn't use tab or return to indent outline items or to create a new lower sibling. It uses modifier and arrow keys. They make sense but it's not what most people are used to as no other apps uses those keys. Before most anyone can use it, they have to edit the keybindings (which are sweetly customizable.)\nIdiosyncratic example: It depends heavily on \"Style Sheets\" for formatting, filtering and other functions (I think) but the \"Style Sheet\" functions are fairly buried and you have to dig for them. The documentation starts out talking about how to use Style Sheets and only at the very last of the subject does it tell you how to actually make one. \nSince Neo is an old app, I suspect it is \"crufted\" i.e. acquiring features over the years like barnacles each just tacked on and the whole having no pattern and it ends up like a software Rube Goldberg machine. \nI decided to go with Neo after trying demos of Tree, OmniOutliner, FoldingText, Workflowy and a few other browser based. Tree is neat and clean but to simple for what I need long term. OmniOutliner can do just about anything but runs $99 and I'm still experimenting with using outliners in my workflow. \nPlus, I fiddle with applications the way other people play video games so Neo didn't seem as frustrating to me as it would to others. \nBut I would not describe exploring Neo as a \"pleasant user experience\" its an uphill battle but if you've got more time than money to burn and need OmniOutliner level formatting, view, column, sorting, etc options then Neo is likely a good choice. \n", "Q: osx split external hard drive partition I currently have a 640GB external HD that has 1 partition formatted as HSF+ Now I want to split some of the free space into a new FAT32 partition, without having to reformat the whole HD and losing all my data. I read that I'm supposed to be able to add new partitions in the Hard Disc Utility by clicking the \"+\" sign, without any loss of data. But in my case the \"+\" is not clickable and it says that this partition cannot be altered.\nCan anyone tell me how to proceed. Or is it impossible without reformatting the whole disc?\nI'm running OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6\n\nA: You should unmount the disk before you try to change the partitions.\nThat should work.\n\nA: So far I know is that if you don't use the MAC OS EXTENDED Format and a GUID Partition table for the first partition you won't be able to adjust the size of the partition or squeeze in a new one. The only thing you can do is create a new partition with the free unpartitioned space on the ext. HD which is left over (supposed you left over some free unpartioned space).\n", "Q: How can a keyboard be shared with an iPad? What are the ways for both an iMac and an iPad to share the same physical keyboard?\nIf it's possible to share a regular Apple bluetooth keyboard between both devices without jailbreaking the iPad, I think it would be my favored option.\n\nA: I don't think you can. Bluetooth is designed such that pairing is two-way (computer <-> device). You can't pair to a second device without un-pairing from the first device.\n\nA: Bluetooth only allows pairing with one device at a time.\n\nA: This might help you, or at least lead you in the right direction.\nhttp://modmyi.com/forums/iphone-news/716935-synergy-ipad-share-your-mouse-keyboard.html\n\nA: Theoretically using the computer as a middle man, You could set a hotkey to switch between the two? No program exists to do it though :(\n\nA: This has worked well for me - especially when I turn off the bluetooth on the current device that has the bluetooth keyboard paired, then turn on the bluetooth on the other.\nSometimes, then pair to the closest device when I power cycle the keyboard.\nYou have to do the initial pairing on each, but I've not had issues using one Apple Bluetooth keyboard with more than one \"computer\" - be it a Mac or an iOS device like an iPhone or an iPad.\nYou of course can't have the one keyboard drive both at the same time - this only works in sequence.\n\nA: Logitech made a solar bluetooth keyboard allowing keyboard to pair 3 device .\nWith your apple bluetooth keyboard, \nJUC400 Wormhole switch will do this.\nOr\nIf you use mac, app \"type2phone\"is a altinative solution.\n\nA: It exists for the Mac, so I guess it could be possible even for Windows.\n\nType2Phone: Virtual Bluetooth Keyboard\nType2Phone lets you use your Mac as Bluetooth keyboard to your iPhone,\n  iPad or Apple TV.\nType on your full-sized keyboard.

In other words, emacs thinks I am pressing \"option-[ z\" when I pressed \"shift-tab\" on the keyboard of my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.6, what is the problem and how do I correct it? Thank you.\n\nA: Terminal.app is actually doing what it's supposed to:  shift-TAB sends ESC [ z which Emacs reads as M-[ z.  The problem is that the terminal description for xterm-color (the one usually used with Terminal.app and other terminal emulators) is missing the kcbt declaration, so Emacs doesn't know that that's what the key sends.\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the terminal description:\n$ infocmp >xterm-color.ti\n$ printf '\\tkcbt=\\E[Z,\\n' >>xterm-color.ti\n$ sudo tic xterm-color.ti\n\n\n*Tell Emacs about it directly:\n$ echo \"(global-set-key \"\\M-[Z\" 'something)\" >>~/.emacs\n\nThe problem in both cases is that there doesn't seem to be a backwards-tab command to substitute for something.  Emacs.app binds backtab to yank; what do you want it to do?\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal is more compatible with modern xterm† and therefore the default $TERM value is now xterm-256color, which contains the kcbt entry, eliminating any need to edit the terminfo entry. xterm-color describes an older branch of xterm and is missing a number of things supported by modern xterm.\n† Highlights include: Terminal now uses the BCE (Background Color Erase) color model, it supports 256 colors, and the latest xterm-compatible escape sequences for switching to/from the alternate screen buffer.\n", "Q: itunes commercial podcast piracy security I'm just wondering how secure commercial podcasts on itunes are protected against piracy? \nDoes it even matter for security if the podcast is provided over itunes or is it the content provider himself who must make the proper security adjustments? \nNOTE: Yes I know that all security measures can be bypassed especially in this part of IT. But it makes a difference if it takes 2-3 minutes or 2-3 years ;)\n\nA: The security must be provided by the content provider, though iTunes can access password-protected podcasts. The content provider sets up password protection via HTTP authorization and/or SSL encryption. It's then as secure as SSL, which is the standard for encryption on the Web, used by Websites for secure transactions, such as stores, credit cards, etc.\nSee this link for more on setting it up.\nOnce you've set it up, you can access the podcast via iTunes by clicking a link on the content provider's site. iTunes gives you an authorization dialog to access the podcast:\n\nApple says it does not list password-protected podcasts on the iTunes Store.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect a single Dropbox Mac app with two or more Dropbox accounts? Is it possible to connect a single Dropbox Mac app with two or more Dropbox accounts?\nAssume I have corporate and private account. How can I use a single dropbox app for them?\n\nA: You can't do it out of one copy of the app, but it seems that you can duplicate the app. You can see (somewhat complicated) instructions here:\nhttp://maketecheasier.com/run-multiple-dropbox-accounts-in-mac-and-linux/2010/05/24\nI haven't done this personally, but this looks like it should work.\n\nA: I do this with one copy of Dropbox.

I'd prefer not to install the whole iOS SDK with Xcode, just the gcc toolchain for my own console applications and school work. I know for the old Xcode installs it was possible to customize the install and deselect it, but I'm not sure how the Mac App Store handles it and I'd like to know before I buy it and try to install it. The iOS SDK is a good 4-5 gigs of overhead I have no need for, and with an SSD I'm trying to save space wherever I can. \n\nA: Don't accept this answer without vetting it further first, but I think I noticed something during my install.\nI think that you don't get any SDKs as part of the XCode 4 install. It was only after I installed XCode 4 and launched it, that the project window showed a download in progress. Clicking it gave me the option of downloading: OSX 10.6 SDK, Legacy OSX SDK, iOS SDK, and something else that I don't remember at the moment. Perhaps extended documentation.\nSo, the XCode install itself is still very heavy. What with XCode visually, all it's associated applications and libraries, Clang/LLVM/LLDB, profiling tools, and everything.\nBut, the SDKs themself? I don't think it comes automatically. I can't seem to figure out how to get back to choose the other SDKs to download, so I'm not 100% sure in this.\n\nA: *\n\n*Xcode 4 packages could be customise if you use the MPKG installer, this article by Jones Lee walks through the steps needed: Howto fix App Store Xcode 4 95% installation freeze AND customize install template to exclude iOS SDK\n\n*If you only need GCC, the OSX GCC Installer project has pre-built binaries.\n", "Q: Is iTunes required for file management on the iPad? Is it possible manage files on an iPad directly, or do all file transfer (music, movies, etc), have to go through iTunes?\n\nA: iPhone Explorer is the best one out there today. By far.\nOn the iPad itself, only if you jailbreak. Then get iFile.\n\nA: iTunes is commonly used to synchronize and manage content (podcasts, songs, videos, notes, calendar, contacts, and books) for iPad owners.\nThe alternative is to jailbreak which requires some technical knowledge on the part of the owner, may not have the features of the latest released iOS (it takes time for jailbreakers to release new jailbreaks), and is not supported by Apple warranty.\n\nA: If you have access to a Linux machine then the libimobiledevice library is an alternative to iTunes and you don't need to jailbreak the iPad.  With it, you can also mount the file directories of individual apps (whether that helps or not depends on the app).  You can't add tunes to the music player, unfortunately, because the database isn't (yet) writeable by Linux tools (though if you jailbreak, you can modify the database version to one that Linux can deal with).  To work with iOS5 you need the latest version (from the git repository) rather than whatever version comes with your distribution.\nAccording to the website, there are unofficial ports to Windows.\n", "Q: Do Apple retail stores allow trade-ins? Is it possible to trade my 2009 MacBook Pro for store credit or something?\n\nA: Yes, Apple has a Reuse and Recycling Program where you can get a Gift Card for the value of your computer.  Of course, what value they might consider it to have is another question.\n\nA: because to get the information from the old computer to the new after mailing in the computer would not be possible, and to buy the new one before mailing in the old would mean the \"store credit\" could not be used on that purchase.\n", "Q: How to sync or backup iPhone contents to new Mac \nPossible Duplicate:\ntransfering iphone data to another computer\nHow to synchronize iPhone with new Mac without losing data? \n\nI have brought a new mac and would like to sync my iPhone content with the new mac (i.e. contact, calendar, apps and etc..) As the the first sync will erase all contents from my iPhone, is there any way to avoid it. If the iPhone backup has been performed on the old PC, can I restore all the content from the backup if the content was erased during sync with the new mac. Please advise. \n\nA: I logged in, authorized and used \"Transfer Purchases from iPhone\" as described in @appleluntanyi's answer and the linked article.\nWhen syncing apps, I got the dialog\n\nAre you sure you want to sync apps? All existing apps and their data\non the iPhone \"iPhone\" will be replaced with apps from this iTunes\nlibrary.\nCancel / Sync Apps\n\nWhen I synced anyway, it did in fact keep the app data, but it messed up the icon order and grouping.\nSo I would recommend syncing the iPhone to your old computer just in case, taking screenshots of your home screens if you want to remember how they were arranged, doing the login/auth/transfer as described in the article, and then syncing despite that incorrect dialog.\nYou can e.g. transfer the screenshots to the computer through Preview.app: File > Import from iPhone….\n", "Q: Why doesn't ⌥ (option)+click bring up the context menu? Does anyone know why ^ (control)+click was chosen to trigger a context menu, rather than ⌥ (option)+click? Is there any history surrounding this?\nTo me, an alternative method of clicking that brings up a menu of options seems most intuitive if triggered by ⌥ (option)+click, especially considering that key is also known as ⌥ (alt).\n\nA: The option key has been in use on Macintosh computers long before there was a control key, since the option key was always used for alternative input of characters with diacritics, like \"å\".\nApple always tried to force developers into not hiding away functionality into contextual menus and thus did not include more than one mouse button for quite a long time. I think it was once applications gained complexity and needed to offer contextual menus for better usability, that Apple decided to include a control key for the first time. \nIn short: The naming of the control and  option keys are meant quite literal: one gives you access to optional input and one gives you access to controlling the interface.\n\nA: Option-click is taken to pull up alternate menus in place of standard ones, including context menus (see for example in the Dock, where Ctrl-Option-click changes \"Show\"/\"Hide\" to \"Show/Hide Others\" and \"Quit\" to \"Force Quit\", and adds \"Relaunch\" to the context menu for Finder).  Some other menus affected are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Power menu get an additional entry showing the current status\n\n*The WiFi menu shows connection status, including the connection protocol and speed, the current channel, the BSSID of the connected AP, and the signal level\n\n*The Volume slider turns into an audio input and output device selection menu\n\n*The Bluetooth Menu, similarly to the WiFi menu, adds connection status — and also three interesting-looking menu items:\n\n*\n\n*Open Bluetooth Explorer...\n\n*Open Bluetooth Diagnostics Utility...\n\n*Open PacketLogger... (!)\n\n\n*Select All in some Edit menus (notably Finder) is replaced by Deselect All\n\n\nPoke around and you may find some other goodies.  One other thing I noted was that, if you set Parallels to replicate the Windows system tray in the OS X menu bar, some of them behave differently if Option-clicked.\n", "Q: Is there any decent Wordpress blogging client for Mac?

I have a Mac Mini with iTunes 10.2.1 installed, I enabled home sharing in the preferences and the Advanced menu. I also have an iPhone 4 on iOS 4.3, which I enabled home sharing on using the same username and password that my desktop uses.\nBoth computers are connected to the same home network. When I open up the iPhone's iPod app, however, I don't see any of the songs that are only on the Mac. I only see those that have been synced with the iPhone (i.e. I use this Mac to sync my iPhone).\n\nA: Launch the iPod App on your iPhone. At the bottom of the screen, you should see a More button with 3 blue dots.\nAs you can see here, there is a Shared list item at the bottom of the page. Click that, which should bring you to a screen like:\n \nClick the name of the computer that you see in your list and then all of the videos, movies, tv shows, etc, will appear in your lists for those items.\nIn other words, the iPod App won't keep the home-shared content separate. You will see the Home Sharing content as if it was integrated with the device.\n\nA: It should be in Music under More -> Shared\nSelecting your iTunes library then puts it in a home sharing mode and to return to the iPhone's music go to More -> Shared again\nHow to use Home Sharing on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad\n\nA: I was having this same issue on my iphone. I just noticed that my phone was connected via my guest wifi network. Switched to my home network and the shared icon came back.\n\nA: I've had this same situation happen to me. I killed the iTunes app on my iPhone's multitasker, I've restarted my PC, I've disabled and re-entered my credentials repeatedly on the iTunes-PC side as well as the phone side, all to no avail. Home Sharing was there on my phone once before and suddenly it vanished. After hours of turning off firewalls, double checking exceptions in my Windows Firewall and PeerBlock settings, I noticed something. I've noticed my AppleID as \"xxxxxx@gmail.com\" and just \"xxxxxx\". Instead of trying the @gmail one I tried using just the ID on my PC and my iPhone, and it magically worked.\n\nA: I've been having this issue with my iPhone 4 and I think I just figured out the solution. Go to your iTunes folder on your Mac, and check if there are any files other than the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Music Library.xml \n\n*iTunes Library.itl \n\n*iTunes Library Genius.itdb  \n\n*iTunes Library Extras.itdb  \n\n*sentinel (hidden)  \n\n*.DS_Store (hidden)\n\n\n(Any folders are ok, mine has iTunes Media, Mobile Applications, Album Artwork, and Previous iTunes Libraries).\nI deleted all other files I found in that folder, restarted iTunes, and voila, the circle now goes all the way, well, full circle. \nI only had the following, but you may have more or fewer or the same sort of files to delete:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temp File.tmp\n\n*Temp File 1.tmp\n\n*Temp File 2.tmp\n\n*iTunes Music Library Backup.xml\n\n*iTunes Music Library Backup 1.xml\n\n\nI have no idea why this would cause home sharing to stop halfway through loading, but hey, whatever works.  \n", "Q: How can I make spotlight ignore certain file types and directories? Since spotlight continuously updates the index, sometime the file precedence gets changed around and I might type in \"saf\" and press return expecting to get Safari, but instead spotlight attempts to open some Java jar file.  \nQuestion Is there any way to make spotlight ignore certain file types or directories? \n\nA: There is a way to exclude folders: add a .no_index extension to the file or folder name.\nBut my favourite one is adding a .metadata_never_index file to a folder. Use the following command:\n$ cd DIRECTORY\n$ touch .metadata_never_index\n\n\nA: Short answer: yes. \nGo to your System Preferences, then Spotlight:\n\nYou can disable and/or reorder the items in this list. By dragging Applications to the top, \"Saf\" will match Safari first (because it's an App, regardless of it's location). \nIf, on the other hand, there's a Folder(s) or Drive(s) that you want to explicitly exclude from Spotlight until you change your mind, turn onto the Privacy Tab (on top of that panel) and click the (+) button to browse for a folder.\n\nThis window also accepts Drag and Drop of Folders or Drives (Volumes). In my Sshot, you can see that I exclude Clone (my weekly clone drive) from Spotlight so when I search for something I don't come up with duplicated results (one from the main drive and one from the backup). \nI also have added a Public Folder where a lot of ppl drops stuff and I don't care about it nor I want it in my search results.\nIf you want to restore it, you can always remove it from this list (and give spotlight time to re-index it). \nYou can't (as far as I know) exclude by File type.\nNote: in order to drag a \"drive\" just go go the finder, click on your Mac OS Volume and then press ⌘↑ (the up arrow) to go back to the \"root\", you will see your volumes there (among other things). Drag it and drop it onto this Privacy tab and voilá.\n\nA: Not being able to exclude by file type is really annoying.\nThis source claims that if you append .noindex at the end of the filename that file is excluded by safari indexing. I have not been able to verify this trick, but could be interesting for others to try it out.\n", "Q: Taking unlocked iPhone 4 to Canada? I am visiting Canada (Vancouver, BC) this coming week from the UK and have an unlocked iPhone 4 (bought SIM-free from Apple). \nWhat are the best options for buying a pre-paid SIM that will give me some data (around 500Mb) whilst I'm away?\nI already had a SIM cutting tool to make micro-SIM cards from standard SIM cards.\nJack\n\nA: Vancouver is the home territory of Telus, so they're probably your best bet. All three of our major carriers (Rogers, Telus and Bell) support GSM and carry the iPhone 4, so you should be fine.\nThe only Telus pre-paid data plan in BC appears to be $20 for 250MB, http://www.telusmobility.com/en/BC/prepaid/rates.shtml\nRogers has a $45/month pre-paid, includes 500MB, that looks decent, http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wireless-products/plans\n\nA: I have heard Rogers and Telus are good but I have never been to CA and I am unfamiliar with their plans. With all wireless coverage it all depends on the area. I would recommend talking with someone when you get there and finding out what is good in the area you are going to be visiting.\n", "Q: PDF Voice Reader I have been reading PDF files a lot lately and I would very much prefer it if someone could read it out aloud for me ;). Is there any software that you use that can read PDF files aloud so that you can hear it, rather than read?\n\nA: You can do this with OS X's built in speech synth and Preview PDF-reading app. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Dictation & Speech → Text to Speech.\n\n*Check the box (if it isn't already checked) that is labeled \"Speak selected text when the key is pressed\". Then, click the \"Change Key…\" button to the right. Press the keyboard shortcut you want to use (I use shift-cmd-r).\n\n*Now, open you PDF in Preview. Select what you want with the Select tool, or use cmd-a to select everything. Press the key you set earlier, and your computer will think for a moment and then read you your PDF.\nPress your key again to stop.\n\nA: An update for MacOS Big Sur (at least)\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Spoken Content\n\n*Make sure Speak selection is checked\n\n*Then highlight some text, right click, and click on Speech -> Start Speaking\n", "Q: Tile Finder background image in Snow Leopard I have seen a guide/tip on the internet to make Finder tile it's background by editing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist however the guide is now outdated and no longer works on Snow Leopard.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to go about this?\n\nA: It can't be done right now.  Even if you made a background image in Photoshop the size of your display and used that, you'll find that with certain views (eg narrowed windows), you'll still see the edge of the image.\nSomeone somewhere just might write an app to do this, and in my opinion it would be popular.\nUntil then, we're stuck with just colors.\n\nA: Finder provides this functionality in its View Options.\nGo to icon view (cmd + 1) and open View Options (cmd + j).\nThere you may choose between White color, custom color, or a picture.\nSelect picture, drag and drop your picture there and you're done :)\nEdit: \nIn order to make the change system-wide, after setting the image you need to click on \"Use as Defaults\"\n\nA: From what I can tell, Snow Leopard did indeed lose the ability to tile the Finder background image.\nAs an alternative, perhaps you could try creating a new large image composed of the image you want tiled manually. Then this could be used as the Finder background image and it will look tiled.\n", "Q: Can OSX proxy settings vary by browser? I'm moderately familiar with OSX but am attempting to solve an issue remotely.\nMy girlfriend is in Argentina for a bit, and the IP location bars her from many \"US only\" sites that she frequents.\nTo combat this, my proposal is to Install another browser (Firefox in this case) and rig that through a U.S-based Open Proxy server. This would be her \"US\" browser.\nHowever, I wasn't sure whether changing the proxy for one browser's settings would change it in a central location for others. \nSo, long question short: can I configure proxy settings for one browser only on OSX, or do they carry between all browsers?\nThanks in advance for any help you can give!\n\nA: Any application can network directly or use the system settings. As @geekosaur states, Opera has its own setting, as does Firefox (along with the option to use the system settings). Chrome and Safar use the system settings.\nIt's really up to the application developer how they implement their proxy controls (if they even have proxying!).\n\nA: On OSX, proxy settings are configured centrally in most browsers.  Opera uses its own proxy setting, though.\n", "Q: What orthodox file manager for OS X could I use? I'm looking for a graphical file manager fro OS X, for console Midnight Commander is ok.\nI need two panels, function keys operations and preferably FTP and SCP support.\nAlso, it would be great to be free.\n\nA: Marta (free)\n\nSimple and fast file manager for basic tasks like copying, moving and managing files.\nKey features\n\n*\n\n*Open source\n\n*macOS native\n\n*Plugins\n\n*Macros\n\n*Dark/White themes\n\n*Installs from dmg/brew\n\n*Embedded terminal\n\n*Tabs\n\nCons\nLimited functionality at the moment:\n\n*\n\n*No file/text search\n\n*No remote filesystems support (aws, ftp, etc)\n\nPS: I'm neither developer or affiliated with this software.\n\nA: Path Finder\nAlthough not free, I have been using Path Finder for years and love it dearly. Two features I like the most from this applications are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can have two side-by-side panels, what you are looking for. Not only that, each panel can have multiple tabs.\n\n*I can go into a directory by hitting the return key, cmd+O still works.\n\n\nA: ForkLift (23,99 € / $29.99 / £20.99)\nDefinitely a winner for me. Features list on its website: binarynights.com but it pretty much has anything you'd want from an orthodox file manager and it does look nice too :)\n\nA: Mover (free)\n\n\n*\n\n*open/run files and apps\n\n*batch copy/move/delete, file/folder creation\n\n*Operations queue\n\n*search files (with wildcards and regex)\n\n*show/hide hidden files\n\n*keyboard shortcut mapping\n\n*move to Trash\n\n*customizable UI\n\n*listening to file system events\n\n\n\n\nA: CRAX Commander\nThis is a graphical, dual-panel file manager with support for operations (copy, move, delete). This software has built-in support for SSH and FTP. This is not free software but you can download a demo version from the program site.\n\n\nA: Double Commander (LGPLv2)\nDouble Commander is inspired by Total Commander, and is a cross-platform application that works well on OSX (I'm running on Yosemite, 10.10.5, Early 2015 Macbook). \n\nIt is highly configurable (in the screenshot, compared with \"out of the box\", I have configured the free-space display, enabled the left-sidebar tree view, added zebra-stripes, and used Linux Bionlinum as the display font). A partial feature list from the website:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unicode support\n\n*Tabbed interface\n\n*Multi-rename tool\n\n*Custom columns\n\n*Built in file viewer (F3) to view files of in hex, binary or text format\n\n*Internal text editor (F4) with syntax hightlighting\n\n*Archives are handled like subdirectories. You can easily copy files to and from archives. Supported archive types: ZIP, TAR GZ, TGZ, LZMA and also BZ2, RPM, CPIO, DEB, RAR.\n\n*All operations working in background\n\n*Extended search function with full text search in any files\n\n*Configurable button bar to start external programs or internal menu commands\n\n*Total Commander WCX, WDX and WLX plug-ins support\n\n*+ supports FTP/Network operations\n\n\nIt has recently (as of this posting) reached 0.7 and was noted on Webupd8 where a bit of a review plus more description can be found.\nFor those Mac users who like their apps \"pretty\", this interface will probably leave something to be desired. For those accustomed to using \"commander\"-like file managers on Windows or Linux, but now are on Macs ... it is a treat!\n\nA: TotalFinder\nI use http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/\n\nA: Xmander (free)\nXmander is a simple dual panel file manager with a hex file viewer. You can browse through all your system's files, including the hidden and perform the basic file operations like move, copy, trash or create directory.\n\nA: Moroshka File Manager (free)\nToday I discovered another commander, the Moroshka File Manager. It has multiple tabs. Looks great. In particular the footer of the main-window is neat.\n\nA: Cloud Commander is orthodox web file manager for Mac OS, Windows and Linux.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Source (MIT)\n\n*Has Web UI\n\n*Has build in editor with syntax highlighting.\n\n*Has build in console.\n\n\nA: Disk Order ($25)\nSurprised I haven't seen it mentioned, Disk Order has been around since 2003. My personal choice, can do (S)FTP and all the operation expected from a dual pane file manager in a keyboard friendly way – unlike some of the Finder spin-offs.\nNot free though and lately updates haven't been happening that often.\n\nA: Commander One FREE/$29.99 PRO\nAnother MacOS alternative of Total Commander that runs natively for both Intel and ARM CPUs. There are several versions of Commander One: FREE and PRO versions are distributed through the website as well as Commander One version at the Mac App Store.\n\nMajor features of FREE version:\n\n*\n\n*Classic look with dual panes and command line\n\n*Build-in multi-format viewer\n\n*Advanced search with regexp support\n\n*Queue for file operations\n\n*Local network client\n\nPRO pack extends the functionality with:\n\n*\n\n*FTP client\n\n*Terminal emulator\n\n*Support for lots of Cloud services\n\n*Mount for iOS and Android devices\n\nNote that due to Apple sandbox restrictions, App Store versions of the software don't support some functionality.\n\nA: muCommander (free)\nmuCommander has classic orthodox file manager keybindings. Sadly MC is not very mac'ish and lacks multiple tabs.\n\nA: FastCommander\nhttp://osx-fastcommander.appspot.com\nSupports all file operations. Fast, stable, small, lightweight.\nCan be freely downloaded and used - no restrictions, just nag screen.\n\nA: Newton Commander (free + open source)\n\n\n*\n\n*Each tab runs in its own process.\n\n*A tab can run as a different user, eg. root.\n\n*No beachballs since it's only the child process that is hanging and not the UI.\n\n\nA: XCommander ($4.99)\nI have recently noticed XCommander in the Mac App Store. It has classic NortonCommander keybindings, so it's already more usable than PathFinder and Transmit. \nSadly it has a long way to go to reach TotalCommander standards. No multiple tabs, no quicklook.\nWhat I like though is that it's new and it gets the keybindings right from the start. This is promising.\n\nA: Total Commander works on macOS under Wine. By far not the same experience as on a windows box, but adding this answer here for the sake of completeness.\n\nThe procedure is not complicated, but requires some dependencies which you might have already installed for other purposes: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install XQuartz with brew cask install xquartz\n\n*Install wine with brew install wine\n\n*Download the TC installer, then launch it from the terminal with wine tcmd900ax64.exe.\n\n*Create an alias or launcher script which will run  wine ~/.wine/drive_c/totalcmd/TOTALCMD64.EXE (if you installed under the default path).\n\n\nFor some reason latest versions of wine do not enable font antialiasing by default. It can be enabled with winetricks by doing brew install winetricks and then running winetricks settings fontsmooth=rgb in the terminal.\nIt might be possible that certain things, i.e. TC plugins might not work with the 64bit version of Wine. In that case you might want to try with the 32bit version under a 32bit version of wine.\n\nNote: An alternative way to do this without having to type in the terminal could be https://www.playonmac.com.\n\n", "Q: What file comparison tool can I use under OS X? My favorite file comparison tool was Beyond Compare but since I recently switched to OS X, i'm no longer able to use it and I'm looking for an alternative, preferably a free one.\nUpdate: I made the mistake not to specify that I am also looking for a tool that does directory comparison, not only files. Because this could make the already answers invalid I made another question for this What directory comparison tools can I use on OS X?\n\nA: DiffMerge from Sourcegear is simple and free.\n\nA: This is an aggregation of the answers posted on SO's deleted clone, Graphical diff for Mac OS X. It includes links to each product, and the current price since last edit in USD.\nNote that any links to SO will only be visible to users who can view deleted content, which requires either moderator privileges or 10k reputation on that site.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sourcegear's DiffMerge, shareware\n\n*Joachim Eibl's KDiff3, free\n\n*Black Pixel's Kaleidoscope, $69.99\n\n*Bare Bones Software's TextWrangler, free\n\n*Araxis's Merge, $129 + $29/year\n\n*Deltopia's DeltaWalker, $39.95/$75.95\n\n*Kai Willadsen's Meld, free\n\n*Weipin Xia's DiffFork, $26\n\n*Biscade's RoaringDiff, free\n\n*tkdiff, free\n\n\nThere were some other suggestions, which were not diff tools in their own right, which I will list below:\n\n\n*\n\n*It (Beyond Compare) runs well in Wine, but I miss the shell integration. - Danyal Aytekin, May 11 '12, 13:01\n\n*Eclipse also has a fairly decent comparison mechanism. - JeeBee, Oct 9 '08, 12:45\n\n*P4Merge that comes with Perforce is pretty good and comes for free with perforce client. Both terminal and GUI version. - amok, Jul 7 '10, 23:19\n\n*I had to use Vim because most of diffs mentioned here do not understand UTF-8. - user184880, Oct 6 '09, 9:56\nThat about wraps up that thread's merge into this one, as covered here.\n\nA: You can use diff if you're using the command-line.\n\nA: Changes.app has a great reputation and lots of features. Kaleidoscope is great too, and has a beautifully designed UI.\nIt's also worth mentioning if you're doing programming that Xcode 4 has visual diff tools built in now too.\n\nA: There's also DeltaWalker.\nIt's $40, and there's a trial available.\n\nA: Here are which I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileMerge (opendiff)\nIt's bundled with Xcode with Command Line Tools installed\n\n*DiffMerge\nIt's bundled with Xcode with Command Line Tools installed\n\n*vimdiff\nIt's free and open source.

Visit http://www.scootersoftware.com/beta.php?zz=beta4_whatsnew\n\nA: There are a great many comparison tools available. Many do directories and files. Some even perform as merge tools (2 and 3 way). Of these some have already been mentioned in other answers and your choice will depend on what features you require, and how much you are prepared to pay for the tool. There is a good Wikipedia page with a comparison of many of the better known ones.\n\nA: I use Folder Sync It costs $8.99 on the Mac App Store. It works really nicely.\n\nA: I use Kaleidoscope. Or just plain, old diff from the CLI\n\nA: It is not great, but the FileMerge bundled with the OS can be launched from the command line as opendiff a.txt b.txt.\n\nA: P4Merge is a free, very nice diff and merge tool.

Is it safe to remove the Xcode 4 installation program from my Applications folder after I installed Xcode? If there is a free update, will I still get it, or do I have to buy it again?\nThe installer is 4,58 GB, which is space I could use on my hard drive!\n\nA: Yes, it’s safe to remove the XCode installer, once you’ve installed the XCode tools. XCode tools can be downloaded for free from Apple’s website. If you are registered at developer.apple.com, you may also download the iPhone/iPad SDK from developer.apple.com, to be able to create iPhone/iPad software (the XCode tools that ship with MacOS X will only allow you to build applications for Mac OS).\n\nA: According to this tread at the Apple discussion forum I can safely (re)move the installer application and still download it again from the App Store without paying again. It is unclear whether I will get update notifications.\nThis comment on a story about an attempt to upgrade Xcode with low disk space indicates that the move to an external disk may be tracked by the OS, and an upgrade via the Mac App Store can result in the moved application (even if it's on an external disk) being upgraded.\nI did not get an upgrade notification for Xcode 4.0.1, even though my original installer application was still in the /Applications/ folder. I moved the installer application to an external disk (via sudo mv, because dragging it in Finder gave me the message \"You may need to enter the name and password for an administrator on this computer to change the item named “Install Xcode”.\"), I'll report back what happens when I try to upgrade it via the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Additionally, I would back up the installer and save the 4.5 GB download - just in case.\n\nA: You can remove it, but my experience has been that you'll eventually want it again, and even as an apple developer you may lose access to it in the future as they upgrade xCode.\nIt's not a big deal if you don't plan on maintaining your older apps, of you will always keep them updated and move them to new versions of xCode as they come out, but the transition from xCode 3 to 4 was hard for many developers, and even now some software is developed in xCode 3 to support kernel drive development for OS X 10.4, which is no longer fully supported in xCode 4.\nGenerally your best option is to store that installation app somewhere you can get to it later.  It doesn't need to be on your mac all the time, but you may find yourself needing it down the road if you do develop anything in it you might have to update later.\n", "Q: Error trying to backup both iPhone4 and iPad (1) after 4.3/iTunes/XCode updates After the slew of updates this week I'm no longer able to backup either my iPhone 4 or iPad.  There are two errors:\n\"iTunes was unable to load data class information from Sync Services. Reconnect or try again later\"\nand \n\"iTunes could not back up the iPhone \"Lee Hinde's iPhone\" because the backup session failed.\"\nProbably not coincidentally the existing backups don't show up in iTunes (preferences/devices).\nMy searching on these errors indicates they mostly seem to happen to Windows users and I'm on Mac 10.6.6.\nSynching actually works. Odd. I.e., if I update an app on either device or the Mac, they are transferred as they should. It's the backup that's not happening.\nI also updated XCode and the one similar issue I saw on Twitter was from a developer, so I'm leaning towards blaming XCode.\nDid a Repair Disk Permissions.\nAny tips appreciated.\n\nA: I would try manually checking the backups folder(username/Library/Application Support/Mobilesync)and then deleting anything in there. That error message makes me think Xcode but you could try resetting Sync History from preferences in iSync and resetting the SyncServices folder as per http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1627 . Doing that will wipe sync settings for your iPhone so you will have to re-check the information you want to sync in iTunes. I am running Xcode 4 on 10.6.7 and I have not run into this issue. Hopefully this resolves the issue, let me know if this helps. Also as per the last suggestion I would recommend following the instruction on the apple support site for reinstalling iTunes @ http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1224\n", "Q: How can I remove the RAW image files from my iPhoto Library? I'm doing a bit of a disk cleanup, and was surprised to find that my iPhoto library was a whopping 83gig. From what I understand iPhoto keeps a jpeg copy of each RAW photo in your library (but I could be wrong). \nA lot of this space is because the images are in RAW format. \nIs there a way to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*easily convert the raw photos to jpeg and remove the raw image file\n\n*remove the raw files and keep iPhoto's Jpeg version. \n\n\nIt would be awesome if this was a built in iPhoto feature, or a free app which does a little clean up for you. I have no need for the RAW files, but I don't want to lose the jpeg version.\n\nA: No there isn't. Pretty much the point of iPhoto is that it treats the original file as a \"digital negative\" and the non-destructive editing feature is based on that. So, iPhoto (and Aperture) never perform any operations on the Original, only on a copy.\nIt doesn't make multiple versions, tho. There's only one edited version.\nWhat you can do: Export the Edited Versions. Delete the photos from iPhoto. Re-import the edited versions. You'll lose a lot - not least the ability to edit non-destructively - but if that's what you want.\nA better solution is to use an app that does what you want - that is, edit the pics directly.\nYou know that you can store an entire iPhoto Library on a disk formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled)?\n\nA: Make a smart album that shows only RAW images, select the ones you want to delete, and make a new Event from the selection. This will move them to the new event. You can now delete the event, and your RAW images are gone.\nIf you want to make sure you actually have made JPG's of the images, then do the above, but flag them instead of making a new event. Go back to your library and compare the flagged ones to the ones you want to keep. Use some method to mark ones to keep, removing the flags, star them, tag them, whatever works. Update your RAW smart album to ignore the  RAW files that have whatever you used to mark ones to keep.\nBefore doing all this.. Make a backup ;-)\n\nA: I ended up doing this by issuing the command find . -name '*.NEF*' -exec mv {} /Volumes/Data/raw-backups/ \\; in my iPhoto library \"folder\". It seems to work for me.\nNOTE: My iPhoto Library was moved in a nonstandard location (Google Drive) - so that might affect things. With the default location, you might break your iPhoto Library\n", "Q: How to create smart playlists on iPhone? I have a problem: each time I create an album in a smartplaylist in iTunes and sync it with my iPhone, I have multiple items of the same album with different artists names.\nI'm wondering how to create smartplaylists so that I can unify my albums.\nHave you heard of Smartplaylists? Which app would you suggest me?\n\nA: Either you have on your library same album and different artists or, most likely, you're creating some weird rules that generate that behavior, like other folks did. If that's the case, seems like you'd have to change + to ... in any rule that uses the plus sign. Granted, it is inconsistent behavior in this second case and it might get fixed in the future. And, who knows, there might be few other little bugs like this as well.\n\nA: SmartPlaylist $1.99 in the App Store. Amazing app. It lets you sort by many many different parameters (artist, song length, genre, plays, etc.). I highly highly recommend this app. It is a but counterintuitive at first, but stick with it, and you won't regret the $2 you paid for it. \n", "Q: Where I can buy an original OS X Leopard PPC disc for my iMac G4? I've a wonderful iMac G4 with 2 GB of RAM so I can install/upgrade from Panther to Leopard  but I cannot officially buy from Apple site!\nIs there a possibility somewhere to buy an original disk?\n\nA: Besides maybe posting to Craigslist for a better deal, 10.5.6 is still available for sale on Amazon.\nPlease know there was no PPC-specific version of the installer (it works cross-architecture), so if you find one it will work on that Mac (as long as its processor is 867 Mhz or faster w/ 9 GB of free disk space and a DVD drive). It was only Tiger that had separate installers.\n\nA: The best way to get Leopard is to find someone who had Leopard who then upgraded to Snow Leopard.\nBecause Apple doesn't sell \"upgrades\" as such (only full system versions), they can legally and legitimately give or sell you their Leopard disk.\n\nA: One can usually find old versions of Mac OS on eBay.\n\nA: I have seen it suggested that you can order via Apple’s phone sales line (+1-800-MY-APPLE). This may be a good option if you can not find it for less than original retail (US$129) through third-party retailers, auctions, or classified listings.\n", "Q: Interesting Mac OS X error Has anyone ever seen an error like the one pictured below on Mac OS X? What is it? The system is 10.6.6. I'm quite experienced in OS X but I've never seen such a thing. I was booting in verbose modem, and it looks like the verbose mode came \"through\".\n\n\nA: Looks like a kernel panic in Verbose mode. \n\nA: It's an old-style kernel panic report.  When the kernel crashes, there's no way to log what happened ('cause logging requires a working filesystem, which is part of the kernel...), so OS X used to dump the crash info onto the screen buffer.\nIn OS X v10.2, they switched to a system where it stores the crash info into PRAM, and displays a message that \"You need to restart your computer. Hold the Power button for several seconds or press the Restart button.\" in 4 languages.  After rebooting, the info is transferred from PRAM to a normal log file.\n...but sometimes, for some reason, the old-style panic report still shows up under newer versions of OS X.  I haven't seen this happen in a while, but apparently it's still possible under 10.6.6.  I have no idea what causes it to revert to the old-style report (maybe verbose mode?).\nSee Apple's KB article #HT1392 for more details, and examples of the different panic styles.\nEDIT: It occurs to me that it might've both written the crash info to the screen, and to PRAM and hence the log files.  Check in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports and see if there's a matching panic report.\n\nA: It's a kernel panic. Looks like a kernel extension with the bundle identifier \"com.rogueamoeba.hermes\" (Airfoil?) crashed.\n", "Q: Recovering from Laptop HDD crash My Windows 7 Laptop HDD crashed. I bought a new HDD and installed Windows on it. I also installed iTunes.\nI'm patting myself on the back for setting up full backups of my laptop to an external HDD. I have a backup taken from 2 weeks ago!\nAll my songs are on an external drive, but I do not have an XML copy of my library.\nWhat do I have to do to restore my iTunes content from the backup?\n\nA: Reimport the content to your library from the external hard drive. Go to File - Add folder to library and select the folder where your iTunes content is. I would recommend having it copy files to iTunes Media Folder when adding to Library from Edit->Preferences->Advanced. Your playlists and podcast subscriptions probably won't be restored but at least you'll have your content back.\n\nA: I moved the entire iTunes folder (among other folders) from my old HDD to the new HDD - everything automagically appeared in the iTunes application.\n", "Q: macOS cpu/mem monitor in system tray (menu bar) I would like to monitor CPU and memory usage in realtime with charts on a macOS system tray (menu bar).

I have owned and used it for over two years now (30 months, as coconutBattery would have me believe). coconutBattery and Battery Health Monitor both report that the capacity of the battery has gone down to 82% at 4123 mAH charge capacity (with design charge capacity being 5020 mAH). The load cycles (cycle count) is 376, and the battery is reported to be in normal condition. \nNaturally, the battery drains faster now than it did, say, a year ago, or when it was brand spanking new. I don't mind that. That's understandable. What I do mind, however, and what perplexes me is that, after the battery is drained all the way down to around 30%, the MacBook shuts off in a split second. I can hear that familiar click sound from the hard-disk that comes when the power button is held down for a few seconds to forcefully shut down the system. It took me by surprise when I first experienced it. I thought that perhaps it went to sleep because the battery may have drained completely. But it never displayed any alert about low battery (the charge was still reported to be around 30% when the event happened). When I pressed the power button, the MacBook did a POST and started as it would after a cold shut-down. \nIt happened to me every time I had drained the battery down to around 30%. I would think that the electronics on board the battery controller would force the system to go into hibernate (suspend/sleep) mode, while making sure there is just enough charge left to keep the system memory alive somewhere. However, as far as I can tell, obviously, the controller has no reason to think the remaining charge (at 30%) on the battery is appallingly low to warrant any such operations. But, it is as if the battery suddenly abruptly completely shuts itself off, as if its connection gets severed off there in a second. \nI am clearly out of any warranty. But, I would like to know what could be the problem here. The battery is dying, but at 82% capacity, I shouldn't think so. What do you people think?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem (twice!) and had my battery replaced under warranty - I seem to recall there was a battery replacement program for this issue (don't quote me) but even if there was I suppose that would have finished now. \nI'd say you might have a chance if you called and explained the issue or went into an Apple store depending on what kind of person you run in to.\nThere was also a firmware update that was meant to help solve this issue, but it didn't help me and I suppose you'd have gotten that through software update long ago.\nLong story short: It's not that the battery isn't holding enough charge, and not that it's had too many cycles - evidently they just had an issue with their battery production, and your machine has taken this long to be affected by it. Hopefully you get someone nice from Apple, but otherwise a trip to eBay or somewhere else on the internet should be able to get you a new battery for relatively cheap. \nGood luck, hope it works out for you.\n\nA: You need a new battery. After many years of usage, chemicals in laptop batteries will be less active and therefore hold less charge. The sensor in the laptop usually detects the voltage of the battery to imply how much percentage of charge it still holds. And the laptop can only function when the battery provides a certain level of power voltage. As batteries age, the original electronic properties of the battery changes also and the sensed voltage change is no longer a good indicator for how full the battery is charged. When the battery voltage drops lower than the minimal required voltage to drive the machine, the computer automatically shuts down to protect its own circuits from being damaged by insufficient power. That's why you will hear a click and then everything shuts down without warning.\nSo you need a new battery, or just use your laptop with power cord plugged in.\n\nA: No early alert and indicating 30% charge when the charge is exhausted suggests the battery needs to be calibrated, assuming you haven't done this recently.  See this Apple support page for details, but the gist of it is that measuring a battery's state of charge is inexact, so by calibrating it occasionally, it will reset the software's model of the battery state and discharge characteristics, and give a more accurate measurement of the remaining charge.\n", "Q: How do I increase sudo password remember timeout? I already know that I need to tune /etc/sudoers file but I would like to see full information and also a solution that would not require me to use vi editor.\nUpdate: never, ever try to edit the file with something else than visudo.\n\nA: Be really careful about modifying /etc/sudoers directly! \nFor instance, I tried the above suggestion directly:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"\\nDefaults timestamp_timeout=-1\">>/etc/sudoers'\nwhich messed up my /etc/sudoers file (on a CentOS Virtualbox VM). Should have been:\nsudo sh -c 'echo -e \"\\nDefaults timestamp_timeout=-1\">>/etc/sudoers'\nFortunately, I had access to the root account, logged in as root, used visudo and repaired the problem!\nSo, I agree w/ the above comments to use visudo instead.\n\nA: Run sudo visudo and add this line:\nDefaults    timestamp_timeout=-1\n\nSee man 5 sudoers. -1 causes the password to never timeout. You may change the number to whatever you like in minutes.\nThe man page for sudo says that sudo -v \"extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes\".\nRunning 'sudo visudo' instead of editing the file directly causes the system to validate the sudoers file before it commits the changes.  For instance, if you leave a stray character somwhere, when you save and exit, it will say \"there is an error in the sudoers file, what would you like to do?\" ... hence giving you a chance to go back in and edit.  This actually just happened to me 10 minutes ago.\n\nA: All information for sudoers can be found from the terminal with the command\nman sudoers\n\nYou can even user simple text to edit files, however the privs make that difficult. \nsudoers is -r--r----- (Octal 0440)\nThis indicates that Apple really doesn't want you messing with the file. This really is the core security of the OS.\nOptions for editing are vi, emacs, or my personal favourite BBEdit.\n\nA: Disable sudo timeout with this command:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"\\nDefaults timestamp_timeout=-1\">>/etc/sudoers'\n\nTo re-enable sudo timeout with this method:\nsudo sed -i \"/Defaults timestamp_timeout=-1/d\" /etc/sudoers\n\n", "Q: How can I make the OS X privilege escalation popup less annoying?

I added a video (180 MB) to my iPod but I can't access it . I cant see it in iTunes nor on my iPod. But when I connect my iPod to my system, in iTunes it shows that 180MB is occupied with videos (in the bar graph shown below which also shows the space occupied by songs, pics, etc). Can anyone please and tell me how to delete that video?\n\nA: How did you ad the video? iTunes won't let you add videos to a 6th gen nano. \nOne thought: is it a music video? Those you would probably have to remove via the Music tab.\nEdit: after trying with my own nano: if you send a music video to the iPod, it will be sent and show up as a video in the bar graph.\n\nA: In the General tab for your Nano, check Manually Manage Media.\nNow, there should be a triangle next to your iPod in the iTunes source list. You can click that triangle to display the sections of media on your iPod. Go to the Movies one, find your movie, select it, and press delete (if that doesn't do it, try cmd-delete).\nNow, you can un-check Manually Manage if you want. This will re-enable automatic syncing and ejecting.\n\nA: Very easy.Just open the device's content from the \"my computer\" and a folder with files will appear.Just delete it from there.I think you can't do that from iTunes.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to iTunes and find the video file in question.\n\n*Right-click it and select Get Info.\n\n*Select the Options tab.\n\n\n*Change the Media Kind to Music Video.\n\n\n*Click OK - this might take a while for large files but just wait it out.\nAfter it is done you can now view the video file under the 'Music' category at the top left of iTunes for your device. This will give you all your music, so use the search box (top right) to locate your stupid video file. It will have a little TV icon next to it, making it easier to find. From there you can just delete like normal!\n\nA: OK, this was a pain to figure out, but here's how I got it to work:\nIn iTunes, create a new Smart Playlist on the iPod, set it to match media type and set the criteria for whatever kind of video it was (in my case it was a 'Home Video'.) You can change the smart playlist criteria until you find it. When you do, go to info of the video and change the media type to 'Music Video', then it will show up in the music library along with all of your music. Then you can highlight and delete it as you would a song...\nHope this helps someone out there.\nf.w.d\n\nA: Some applications can load files onto iOS devices directly. For example, VLC (an excellent media player that can play almost every type of video known to man) will load files directly onto your device, even though it could be a filetype iOS doesn't play natively (.avi files for example).\nThese apps appear beneath the normal apps window in iTunes and allow you to browse your computer for files, which are then added using the + button. Likewise, the - button will remove files. Perhaps this mechanism can be used to elete your unwanted files.\nI should add that VLC is no longer in the App Store (though it still works just fine if you installed it before the developer removed it) but there are other apps that operate in the same way.\n", "Q: What are the alternatives to Activity Monitor that will summarize cpu time over time? Activity monitor is not always good if you want to see what is keeping your computer busy for a period of time.\nFor example if you have gcc executed hundred of times it will take a lot of CPU power but the overall CPU time consumed by gcc will not appear. I'm looking for a solution that is able to count and summarize application usage so I can know that how the cpu was used.\n\nA: I'm a huge fan of Bjango's iStat menus, which allows one to conveniently place various monitors (CPU, disk usage, network up & down, battery, memory, temperature sensors...) up in the menu bar.  Each one can be pulled down like a menu for additional details.  It's a $16 app.  You can try before you buy.\nEdit:  it looks like they have released another monitoring application called MiStat that is a separate app instead of living in the menu bar.  This allows them to place it in the Mac App Store.  It's available for a $4.99.  \n\nEdit: I'm sorry, I must have not read your question carefully enough before I posted.  I do not know of any GUI tool that is able to aggregate CPU time being consumed by several similar processes as you describe.   The best idea that I can think of would be to write a script that wraps the top or ps commands and adds up processes that match a regular expression.   This strikes me as a market opportunity for a nice utility.   Could you describe a little more of how you would like such a thing to behave? \n\nA: For a long time, I used Ipulse from IconFactory until my company's IT department clamped down on software installs. It offers up a lot of information about the Mac in a small space. It is a visual tool first that then allows for in-depth, text-based analysis by hovering your mouse over it. It's a bit dated (it still shows Mac OS 10.4 as the minimum requirement), so I suggest you demo it to make sure it still works on your Macs.\n\nA: I believe you can use Apple's Instruments' Activity Monitor to record what you want. It's not an always-on solution, but would let you diagnose particular intervals.\n", "Q: Erase All Contents And Settings on iPhone 4 I want to do an \"Erase All Contents And Settings\" on my iPhone 4. Will that require internet access and upgrade to the latests firmware? Or it will just erase everything and leave iOS firmware version as it is right now?\n\nA: The tool you want to use is iTune's Restore to Factory Settings, found in the General tab when your iPhone is connected to iTunes.\nWhile I haven't used this on an iPhone, I am reasonably sure that it will remove your iOS (firmware) updates so that you will have to re-download them.\nIt will also take all your apps, music, videos, and other media off the iPhone, as well as erasing all your settings and resetting them to the defaults. Basically, your iPhone will be just like it was when you bought it.\nDirections on how to perform this operation (and restore afterwards from a backup) are available in the Restoring section of this Apple help document.\n", "Q: How to remove unused MacPorts packages? Whenever I install a program via MacPorts, it gets and installs lots of dependencies. When I uninstall said program, how do I make MacPorts recursively remove all unused dependencies with it?\n\nA: The command to remove a port and its dependents is:\nsudo port uninstall --follow-dependents foo\n\nHowever, if the port you are uninstalling has dependents it will not uninstall without the -f (force) flag.\nOf course you should start by reading over the MacPorts Guide specifically looking into the Uninstall guide section.\n\nA: There's also a script in MacPorts' contrib directory called port_cutleaves you can run to remove unneeded dependencies: http://trac.macports.org/browser/contrib/. It'll ask you for each to-be-uninstalled port and allows keeping some, should you want to.\nThis script is available as a port itself.\nsudo port install port_cutleaves to install and then sudo port_cutleaves to run.\n\nA: I have written some scripts to automate port cleanup: https://github.com/vasi/macports-tools\nThe 'macportsfoster' script will output a list of all ports not required by anything in the requested-list, ordered such that 'port deactivate $(macportsfoster)' will remove all of them in one shot.\n\nA: To avoid accidentally cutting leaves that might be things you requested you should install the port_cutleaves package then run sudo port_cutleaves\nhttps://guide.macports.org/#using.common-tasks.keeplean\n\nMacPorts 1.9.0 added the sqlite portdbformat and MacPorts 2.0.0 dropped the old flat format. The sqlite port DB format is the default for new installations; old installations that were upgraded to 1.9.x will continue to use the flat format1. You can convert a 1.9.x flat system to the sqlite format by upgrading to MacPorts 2.0 or by changing the portdbformat value in  /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and then issuing a port command as root (e.g. sudo port installed).\nOne of the features of the new format is that it keeps track of “requested” versus “unrequested” port installations. An unrequested port is one that was only installed because some other port depends on it. The leaves pseudo-portname expands to all the unrequested ports upon which no other installed port depends. You can use this to “clean up” unneeded ports even if you did not originally uninstall them with sudo port uninstall --follow-dependencies portname (which will do what you want, but only if you remember to use it every time you uninstall something).\n\nYou should examine your existing leaves before uninstalling any of them.\nport echo leaves\n\nSome common leaves (automake, gperf, libtool, pkgconfig) are build-time dependencies of common ports, so you may want to “request” them (sudo port setrequested port1 port2 port3 …) to avoid uninstalling them just to have to reinstall them later.\nYou can uninstall any remaining leaves quite easily:\nsudo port uninstall leaves\n\n\nNote: Before pruning your leaves, you may also want to uninstall old versions of ports that are no longer “active”. This may reveal a few more leaves (i.e. ports that are dependencies of ports that are installed, but inactive):\nsudo port uninstall inactive\n\n\nThere are several sections in the MacPorts Guide that also describe the process of using leaves to uninstall unneeded ports.\n\nA: From the docs:\n\nThe uninstall action will uninstall an\n  installed port.\n%% sudo port uninstall vile Note\nTo also recursively uninstall the\n  ports that the given port depends on,\n  use the ‑‑follow‑dependencies flag.\n  This will not uninstall dependencies\n  that are marked as requested or that\n  have other dependents.\nTo recursively uninstall all ports\n  that depend on the given port before\n  uninstalling the port itself, use the\n  ‑‑follow‑dependents flag.\nIf a port is a dependency of another\n  installed port, uninstall will not\n  remove it unless you remove the\n  dependent port(s) first. To override\n  this behavior, use the -f (force)\n  switch. This will obviously break the\n  dependents. Don't force uninstall\n  ports unless you know what you are\n  doing.\n%% sudo port -f uninstall vile\n\nNote the major caveat in the last paragraph. Dependencies are exactly that—dependencies—and different apps can (will) require the same dependencies.\n\nA: I think the other answers, and the --follow-dependents flag, do not do what you want. If you install A, and A requires B, then thanks to the wonderful package management systems, B will be installed for you. You can uninstall B and the --follow-dependents flag will be aware of and remove A. But what if you uninstall A, which is more likely, because A is what you manually installed in the first place? In this case, B is left behind.\nIf you use fink, the debfoster package is designed to clean out your system and remove unused dependencies.\n\nDebfoster will help you get rid of\n  packages (libraries for example) get\n  left behind on your system when the\n  program that required it was removed\n  or upgraded to a version that doesn't\n  have the dependency.\n\nWhile debfoster will not work for MacPorts, there appears to be ports of debfoster, for example, portsfoster, although it seems to be discontinued...\nPerhaps no solution currently exists for MacPorts.\n\nA: I had a lot of py36-* packages. As currently Python 3.6 is older, I uninstalled all these packages uninstalling its dependents as:\nsudo port uninstall --follow-dependents python36\n\nI hope it helps\n", "Q: Unable to install from downloaded disk image file My Mac G4 (running OS X 10.3.9) won't install from any .dmg file I download. It keeps popping up a message: \"name of setup & no mountable file system\" or \"application file cannot be found\". Is there some setting I need to change to get around this problem as I need to install some extra programs urgently.\n\nA: It is likely the disk images do not support Mac OS X 10.3.9.\nThe command line tool used to create disk images is called hdiutil. This hdiutil manual page documents the DMG format's history and compatibility with older editions of Mac OS X.\nhdiutil manual page\n\nA: I think a lot of the DMGs that you find on the internets today are compressed, which older disk utilities may not support.

I'm on the train every day, and I always have people looking over my shoulder.. just can't help that.  How can I disable this?\nOn Android, you can disable this in settings, but on iOS I can't find this setting anywhere.\n\nA: The reason why you can't find the setting anywhere, is because such setting doesn't exist in iOS. I am not familiar with the Jailbreaking \"world\" in a sense where I haven't installed software from Cydia and such, but you can certainly try to find an app that does that. \nPlease notice I said: \"try\", because it might not even be possible. \nOn the other hand, the only reason for that is to make sure you've pressed the right key… I never liked it either but oh well.\n", "Q: Will upgrading to 4GB RAM on a white MacBook work?

I just purchased a ZAGGmate case with Bluetooth keyboard. I immediately logged into a Linux machine via iSSH and opened up vim. I can type just fine on this little keyboard, but I am having difficultieas with several keys.\nFirst, the Esc key is bound to the home screen key. I tried holding Fn while pressing Esc. Sadly, that did not do the trick.\nAlso, the control key does not seem to work. For example, CTRL-F and CTRL-B do not scroll forward and back a page in vim. Any clue how to correct that situation?\nUpdate: I found an iSSH setting that maps option key chords to control key chords. That solves my second problem. Also, I can now press CTRL-[ to get the same effect as pressing Esc. So, I'm not mad enough to return the keyboard to the store anymore. Any help with the first part of the question would still be very much appreciated.\n\nA: I've developed a terminal for iOS (it is not released, is intended as a base for other projects) and I have tried for hours to see any kind of event or modifier when meta keys are used on an external keyboard. The only way to get these events is to use private APIs and if you do that you can't get your app on the store. I have filed an issue (Apple rdar 10283552) and hopefully this will change in a future release.\nSo the problem is not your keyboard, it is iOS. I think you have found the best solution with key chords, unless you want to use one of the better apps like Prompt, which gives you \"soft\" meta keys on the screen - but the whole point is to keep your hands on the external keyboard, I know.\nI don't know for sure if Prompt keeps those meta keys visible when a BT keyboard is connected - it can be done in code - if it did maybe soft metas would be better than nothing.\n", "Q: Can I download a free app from the App Store without a credit card? I just recently got an iPod Touch and wanted to download some free apps. The App Store wanted me to get an Apple ID, no problem. But now it's telling me to input a credit card.

I then read that it's disabled in some countried, so I tried telling iTunes that I'm in the US (I'm in Argentina), but still no \"None\" option. Later, I read that apparently this feature was disabled in iTunes 10, so I installed iTunes 9, but I still don't get the option.\nHow can I get the No Credit Card option to appear when downloading an app for the first time? It doesn't make sense that you should need a credit card for free stuff.\nEDIT: To clarify, I already made an account in Apple's website, I'm looking for a way to be able to select \"None\" when buying an app through iTunes.\n\nA: To get an app for free (if you didn't get the choice to pick None as payment option) you should open your installed ITunes program. Then from within the program go to ITunes Store and pick any free app and try to buy it (Google Translate or some other one). It will tell you to login/register into ITunes. If you create account from there you will have a choice to pick None as payment option.\nThis worked for me several times for my customers.\n\nA: Buy an Apple iTunes Gift Card for $10 and redeem it in your iTunes account. That should satisfy their internal logic and allow you to download free items (and obviously buy items if you wanted to).

When I replace the batteries in my Magic Mouse, I turn the mouse off, replace batteries and turn the mouse back on. The problem is that the system does not notice the mouse after this procedure, the mouse cursor stays stuck. I have to put the computer to sleep and wake it again to make the mouse work. Is there a better way to “wake” the mouse, maybe using some keyboard shortcut or a special click combination?\n\nA: A simple click should do it.

The Terminal.app application from OS X is quite good but it lack some functionality that I find really important like: ability to setup SSH profiles for connecting to different servers and ability to setup tunneling.\nI know that there is a putty port for OS X but it uses X and is ugly. Is there any other alternative, preferably free?\n\nA: For SSH you just open a local Terminal and type ssh host.\nYou set up the configuration for each host in ~/.ssh/config following the rules laid down in man ssh.\nI guess I don't understand why anyone would need a graphical tool to set up SSH, a command-line program.\n\nA: Taken in mind that setting up a tunnel by your self is really easy, you may consider using iTerm2 as a replacement to Terminal.app.\niTerm2 features profiles, so you may connect to any SSH server instantly.\nAdvantages over Terminal.app:\nhttp://www.iterm2.com/\nIf you still need to use a gui for tunneling, then you may use an app like: \nSSHTunnel or SSH Tunnel Manager\n\nA: I like JellyfiSSH - I've just emailed the kiwi dude that writes it & asked for an option to open new connections in a new tab rather than opening a window for every single connection.  Otherwise I like it.  Mind you I paid my $4 or whatever it was just to try it.\n\nA: I have, and continue to recommend JellyFiSSH. But my tone has changed a tad. It used to be free, and it's a very simple, very helpful application. Visual creation of tunnels not terribly unlike PuTTY, and lots of other SSH tweaking capability.\nHowever, it's no longer free.

The accuracy of Location Services (the part of iOS that determines where you are) is dependent on a number of factors. iOS does account for this, though:\n\nApplications that can display your location on the screen, including Maps, indicate your current (approximate) location using a blue marker. If your location can’t be determined precisely, a blue circle also appears around the marker. The size of the circle depends on how precisely your location can be determined—the smaller the circle, the greater the precision.\n\n(Source)\nTo answer your base question, though, no. There's really no way for the iPad to track fine movements (such as within a room, or even within a building) with great degrees of accuracy without the 3G model, which does include a GPS chip.\nLocation Services on the WiFi model is intended just to find your general location, so apps can tell you what is nearby. It isn't meant to tell you exactly where you are.\n", "Q: Rebooting iPhone Doesn't Kill off All the Process I tried to reboot my iphone according to the guidelines here, but after the phone is started, I found that all the apps are still there at the bottom of the screen when I tap on the home button twice.\nAny idea why this is so?\n\nA: \nall the apps are still there at the bottom of the screen when I tap on the home button twice\n\nI don’t think that means the processes aren’t killed off. As far as I know, the apps listed when you double-tap the home button are those that were most recently running, not necessarily those that are currently running.\nSee further two recent blog posts on the subject:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://speirs.org/blog/2012/1/2/misconceptions-about-ios-multitasking.html\n\n*http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/ios_multitasking\n\nA: Very few of those apps actually have running processes, even if you don't reboot. Only if they're finishing a download, streaming audio, tracking your location or handling a VOIP call. Otherwise, they've just saved their session state, and have no running processes associated with them.\n\nA: The only real way to be certain that you have killed apps off is to jailbreak.\nJailbreaking lets you install a piece of software called SBSettings, which includes a real task manager that lets you force-quit any app, including the Apple apps.  \n\nJailbreaking is awesome for lots of other reasons too!\nI got this picture off my iPad by starting the Samba daemon I have installed, and just browsing to the image using windows explorer.\nNo cable or iTunes needed,\n\nA: As a developer I can assure you that if you reboot the phone, those apps are no longer running in any way. At that point it's literally just a list of apps that you've launched in the past in reverse chronological order.\nEdited to note: I've since verified (as @ughoavgfhw pointed out) that backgrounded apps can in fact have their services restarted after a reboot. You can still kill all non-Apple services using the method I describe below.\n\nIf you still don't feel comfortable, you can manually quit the apps any time. Simply double-press the home button to reveal the list of \"running\" apps -- the multitasking bar -- and tap-and-hold on one of them, the same way you rearrange you apps in Springboard. \nThey'll begin to wiggle, and instead of the black circle with an \"x\" in it that appears in the upper-left corner of each app icon (used to delete apps off the device entirely) you'll see a red circle with a \"-\" in it. Tap the red circle and the app will be completely forced from memory, killing an associated processes. After you've quit the first several, even if you haven't restarted your phone you're in the \"totally suspended\" territory. \nPress the home button again to stop the wiggling, as normal.\n\nDeleting an App: Black Circle with \"x\"\n     \n\nQuitting an App: Red Circle with \"–\"\n     \n\nEmpty multitasking bar, all apps have been dumped\n\nA: I noticed the same thing myself a little while ago. This is annoying. Apple claims that the apps are in \"stasis\" and not eating processes, but I find that hard to believe that is true with EVERY app. Especially ones that are in the background waiting to alert you of something (like Skype telling you that you have an incoming call or a GPS app)\nI really wish that a \"hard reset\" would clear out all the background apps but the ugly truth is that the operating system just doesn't work that way.\nThere is nothing you can do about this until Apple changes how this works with an OS-level update.\n(p.s. When I took my iPhone an Apple store to get it looked at with a problem with the sleep wake switch, the Apple rep told me that he \"cleaned out all the background apps\" to make things run smoother. Which makes me think that these apps aren't working as exactly as we think that they are)\n", "Q: How can I install the X11 version of Firefox on Snow Leopard? (Preferably without MacPorts or Fink?) I’m doing some screen-scraping using Selenium, a framework which lets you programmatically control web browsers on your system. I’m running it as part of a web app on a Linux server, and on my MacBook Pro for when I’m writing the web app.\nOn my server, Selenium uses Firefox headlessly (by using Xvfb instead of a real display). I’d like to do the same thing locally, so that I don’t have Firefox windows popping up all the time whilst I’m writing and testing Selenium code. In order to do this, I need to install the X11 version of Firefox on my Mac.\nI’ve seen a lot of references to MacPorts and Fink, but is there a way to just install the X11 version of Firefox, rather than installing MacPorts or Fink just for this one-off?\n\nA: Firefox requires a Window library to be linked with e.g. QT, Gnome and several other C libraries. Thus to build it will need a lot of other code so I think using Homebrew/Macports/Fink would save time.\nIf you want any other X11 apps then Homebrew/Macports/Fink is likely to be the easiest way to get them.\nAlso as per @Nathan G. I have found installing Macports not to be difficult.\n", "Q: Can I change the color of my Mac OS X Terminal window depending on which server I am ssh-ed to?

How is everyone else solving this?\n\nA: you can use a script to connect to your servers, which also changes the bg color of your terminal before it connects.\nhttp://www.macosxhints.ch/index.php?page=2&hintid=1001\n\nA: Use different bash scripts to launch each session and change the background color depending on the server.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/4404242/programmatically-launch-terminal-app-with-a-specified-command-and-custom-colors\n\nA: You may use iTerm2 bookmarks, where you can customize each bookmark with its own settings!\n\nA: Further to the iTerm bookmarks that are in @nuc's answer where you have to create a profile for each machine and then make its script the ssh command.\niTerm also has some shell integration which you can use to choose different iTerm profiles (these include colour schemes) depending on the machine name. Thus your terminal changes colour when you ssh into a machine which you can do at any time and not just at the start of a session as in the above case.\n", "Q: iTunes to iPhone cannot sync parts of the iTunes music library I'm using iTunes on Windows and I have my Music Library. Recently I added some music (Mafia II soundtrack I purchased with the game) to the local iTunes Library, but the neither the Artist, nor the Album turn up in the Music Sync overview. Can someone tell me what might be the issue here?\nEdit:\nThe Soundtrack in Question is the Mafia II Soundtrack acquired through the Digital Deluxe Steam Version. The Files are all in MP3 Format and to my knowledge properly tagged.\nI primarily tried adding it by hand (dragging it into iTunes) and by adding them via the Add Folder/File to Library buttons. I disabled iTunes ability to manage the folders itself, as that is a behavior I do not want.\nHowever, now, after removing and readding the tracks to the library several times, the Album itself (\"2K Games - MAFIA II Official Orchestral Score\") appears in the Album overview of the Music Sync menu (and there only). When looking for the ID3 Tag of the Genre (\"Soundtrack\") or the Contributing Artists (\"2K Czech / FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague\") and Album Artist (\"2K Games\"), nothing can be found. This changes my initial question to a small extent, but the problem, in a way, remains: It can't be found in 2 out of 3 overviews of my iTunes library.\n\nA: How did you add the music to iTunes? Did you drag and drop it into the iTunes windows itself or did you manually add the music to the local folder?\nIf you manually added the music to the to the local folder then you need to \"re-sync\" your iTunes library so that the music appears in iTunes application.\nJust choose \"Add Folder to Library\" and choose your iTunes music folder so that it \"re-syncs\" your library and ALSO adds all the new songs to your list as well.\n\nYou can add songs manually to your iTunes music folder without them appearing in iTunes if you navigate to the iTunes music folder itself on your computer and just drop the music in. iTunes tells you in the preferences:\n\nBut all of this is irrelevant until you tell us how you added the music to your computer???????\nHope this helps!\n\nA: It could be a codec issue and, if that's the case, you'd need to re-encode them to an accepted format (basically: mpeg, wave, aiff and apple's). But that usually comes along with an error message once you try to add it or play it on iTunes.\nIf you can actually play the music on iTunes only, but can't sync them to iPhone, most likely you have an issue on the phone, which usually is solely related to lack of free space.\n", "Q: Moving my iTunes library file to a new machine I have machine x (running Windows) that has my iTunes library file on it in the My Music folder.  All the media files in the library are on an external hdd.  I use machine x to sync my iPod on a regular basis, and have built up quite a history of songs played, recent songs, etc.\nI now want to replace machine x with machine y (also running Windows).  Is it a simple case of 1) Installing iTunes on machine y; 2) moving the iTunes library file to the My Music folder on machine y and 3) then connecting the HDD to machine y (ensuring it has the same drive letter)?  Then launch iTunes.  Will machine y now know about all the song history (like play and skip counts, ratings...) as it was on machine x?  The thing I'm most afraid of is sync'ing my iPod on machine y only to have something go nasty wrong and I lose my history?\nAny pointers?\n\nA: Apple has a support document, iTunes for Windows: Moving your iTunes Media folder.\nThe answer to your questions is \"yes\".\n\nA: You can (and have to) certainly move the .XML file, because that's where your history (as you call it) lives. All the playing count, ratings, etc. is stored in your library.xml (and -under Windows- perhaps another file). The reference to where the media is physically stored (your external drive) is also there, so that shouldn't change unless the new drive is on a different Letter on the new machine. (That'd be another mess)\nSo Yes, you have to move the library folder to the new computer and then, you also have to make sure that you Deauthorize your old computer and Authorize the new one, so the new computer can play any DRM content. \n\nA: In iTunes, on your first machine, you will have to go to File|Library|Export Library.\nThis will generate your Library.xml file.\nIf you take a look in it, you will see for each file all the fields you will find in iTunes (location on HDD, play count, rating, etc...).  \nNow, on your new machine, after having installed iTunes, you have to go to File|Library|Import Playlists (not obvious at first as I was looking at an Import Library menu but it doesn't exist) and select the xml file you exported on your first machine.\nIf you try, as I did first, to edit the xml file and overwrite the newly created one, when launching iTunes, it will delete it and create again an empty new one. You have to go through this Export/Import process (which is quite quick).  \nPS: you may have to edit the xml file anyway before importing, if the paths to the music files changed from your initial machine. For example, I upgraded from WinXP to Win7. As the user folder path changed, I then had to edit the paths c:\\users and documents\\myuser\\My Documents\\My music to c:\\users\\myuser\\Music, or something like that, I don't remember exactly.\nPPS: Always keep your exported xml file untouched somewhere until you have everything OK on your new machine...\n", "Q: Unable to access my Mac keychain due to this i am completely new to Mac.\nRecently i tried to change the home folder name of my mac mini. i have gone through a website and followed some instructions to do that. finally i have ended up by creating a completely new user profile with a new home folder name. after some time i have decide to turn back to my old user and deleted the recently created user.

However I expect that I may have to use it in a hot and dusty environment. Any idea how badly the cooling system would be affected by prolonged exposure to dust?\nI took a look at the teardown done by iFixit and there is a single CPU fan. Would it be easy to clean this fan if required? and how likely are the air passageways to get clogged by dust?\n\nA: I do not know about the dust (as a comment asked, it really depends on the amount and type of dust), but I would definitely not recommend using your MacBook Air as if it were heat resistant. Specific computers are assembled for warm (and damp) climates: if your MacBook Air, as I suppose, is not one of them, I would recommend that you do not take that risk unnecessarily, hoping for the best. Laptops can get damaged by lesser threats than prolonged exposure to heat, which is a serious one.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme: Keep IP address from changing I've got an AirPort Extreme base station that I use for several computers and devices.\nI set it to configure IPv4 with DHCP, but there's a problem with that: The IP changes from time to time (as reported in AirPort Utility and whatismyip.com).\nI need the IP address to stay the same, so I set the AirPort to configure IPv4 manually, and left the settings there that were last setup automatically.\nThis arrangement worked for a while, but before long the Internet connection cut out (for all computers on the network). I set the AirPort back to DHCP and restarted, which fixed the problem. A day or so later, I switched back to manual mode. The same thing happened.\nSo, I currently have my AirPort set to configure IPv4 with DHCP. My IP address changes from time to time, which makes it impossible to exclude my traffic from Google Analytics reports. But, if I change back to manual, Internet cuts out after a while.\nDoes someone know what's causing this and a way to fix it (or otherwise keep my IP the same)?\nI'm really bad at this networking stuff, so it's quite possible that I'm fundamentally misunderstanding something. Please correct me if that's the case.\nThanks!\n\nA: Your External IP Address (or, as you call it, the IP address reported by whatismyip.com) is not under your control and you can't simply set it to static. Your ISP gives you a new one when you reconnect, although there are chances that you might get the same, you should never count on it.\nIn order to solve this problem you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer you a \"Static\" IP service for a monthly fee. With the lack of IPv4 in the world, this service is unlikely to exist forever to individuals and it's usually reserved for companies and services that really need a static IP. Not all the ISPs offer this, you can always ask.\n\n*Use a Dynamic DNS provider. This will mean that although your IP address will eventually change when you disconnect (or your provider wants), you will always be able to get \"back\" to your Airport's IP by using a \"name\" rather than an IP. Any computer in your network will have a small piece of soft (some routers can do this automatically, I'm not sure about Airport Extreme, don't think so), that will periodically check your IP and if it has changed, it will inform the Dynamic DNS service that you use so it can update the value.\nSome Dynamic DNS Providers (Mostly a free service) are (in no particular order): \n\n\n*\n\n*DynDNS\n\n*No-IP (I use this)\nThink of this as if instead of having a fixed phone number (static ip), a person could call you by \"name\" and the phone will check what is your current number (wouldn't that be great? ;) Nobody knows your number, only your name, because your number changes often (your ip!).\nYou haven't mentioned why you need a Static IP in the first place, but if you can't get it via your ISP, your only hope is to use Dynamic DNS. For what is worth, DDNS works really fine and it's very \"fire and forget\". Once it works, you no longer have to worry about IPs or anything, you just connect to: XXXXX.no-ip.org (for example)\n", "Q: Is it possible to update iPhone4  to a provider-neutral OS so WiFi hotspot can be enabled? I want to use an original (non jailbroken) iPhone4 to access the internet with an iPad. \nThis should is possible using the Personal wifi hotspot included in iOS 4.3 as mentioned in Can I use tethering to share my iPhone's connection with my iPad?, however some providers (such as the Dutch T-mobile) have removed this feature in a localised version of the OS.\nIs there a (legitimate) way to update to a \"generic\" iOS so I can use the Personal Hotspot to tether my iPad or is there another (legitimate) way to not have to get the 3G iPad and an extra sim card.\nPlease note I am in Europe, i.e. not on AT&T or Verizon\n\nA: It is not a carrier localized version of the OS that is installed on the iPhone. There is one iOS release image for each hardware model. What changes for each mobile network is the carrier settings, which is downloaded either OTA (iOS4+) or by iTunes when the phone is activated or connected and an update is available.  \nIf you have the released from any carrier lock then if you move to another mobile provider supporting the tethering feature then their carrier settings will enable the preference. \n\nA: Maybe this would help you?\nMac: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL851\nWin: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL926\n\nA: I doubt the feature is removed from your version of the iOS. The carrier has complete control over whether or not this feature is visible on your iPhone by configuring your account with them. In my case, I am a US AT&T customer with an iPhone 4, but because I don't pay for the plan that has tethering as an option, when I go to the Settings panel, I do not see a preference to turn on/off tethering. My friend who is also a US AT&T customer with an iPhone 4 and the correct plan that allows tethering, has the phone tethering on/off option where I have none (we've compared our settings screens).\nI wouldn't waste time trying to track down some non-localized version of the OS in the hopes that this feature is going to be there.\nSorry. I wish I had better news for you.\n", "Q: Remove seconds of silence at end of GarageBand exports Whenever I export a song to disk from GarageBand, it automatically adds a few seconds of silence to the end.\nI don't want that silence, as the files I'm exporting are sound effect mixes to be played manually one at a time. I know that I can go into Audacity and manually remove all of the silence at the end, but I'd rather avoid spending that much time cleaning up after GarageBand.\nIs there a way to tell GarageBand not to add silence to the end of tracks it exports?\n\nA: As far as I know, GarageBand doesn't add anything to the end of exported tracks, but it exports as much as there's sound in any track. Therefore, to avoid having extra \"stuff\" exported, you should always create a loop region and export with that. As you can see in the following picture, I'm at second 47 in the \"timeline\", however, I've created a region (the yellow bar on top) that starts at second 1 instead of 0, therefore creating a 46 second clip.\nThe exported version can be seen in quicktime with a length of 46 seconds, without any extra silence or sound.\n\nIn order to create such region, you have to activate the \"repeat/loop\" (next to the Play button in GarageBand). That will create an extra space below the Beat Bar (where you move the Play Head). When you hover your mouse over that small region, the cursor changes. You can click and \"drag\" to paint the yellow zone. That's the zone that will be repeated over and over.\nAlways export with a repeat/loop zone created and Garageband will only export that.\nNOTE: Logic Pro/Express behaves the same way when creating bounces.\nThere's a draggable cursor at the end of the timeline on the upper right corner. If it is beyond the end of your sound on your longest track GB will include that much silence. Drag it back to the end of your longest track, or leave however many seconds of silence you want.\nUpdate 2020 - What about iOS?\nI don't use macOS anymore but if you want to do this on iOS or iPadOS, if I don't incorrectly recall, your only choice is to have a region that encompasses the part you want to export, tap it (to select it), then tap it again (to see a floating set of buttons), and pick \"Loop\". I don't know/think there's a way to do the same \"playback region selector\" on iOS. I may be wrong, but this question was about the OS X version of GarageBand so I don't know more :)\n\nA: In further detail, in order to see the cursor change, start at the beginning of the track. \nIn Garageband 11, the loop region icon is located next to the metronome.  \n\nA: NOTE:\nAlso the \"Include Audio Tail\" switch on the bounce page in LPX determines whether the long tails of reverbs are added at the end of the file.\n", "Q: I've managed to break my terminal, (iTerm2(b17), ZSH, OSX10.6.6) I'm migrating to a shiny new laptop (yay) unfortunately I've manually set up my iTerm to match the old machine, but something is not right (not yay).\nI'm experiencing\n\n\n*\n\n*using xterm-256color doesn't give the full colour set for say, vim.\n\n*applications like vim dont clear out of the scrollback when exited.\n\n*my ↖ home and ↘ end keys are completely broken and I can't seem to Google a solution\n\n*my ⌫ backspace key doesn't delete backwards, it adds a 'space' and prevents further input until ^C.\n\n\nHere is my .zshrc and my .profile.

One of the features added in the iOS 4.3 update is the ability to tether to your iPhone via wifi in addition to the USB and bluetooth tethering that's been in iOS since 3.0. I understand the use case for wifi tethering (multiple devices, non-computers like iPads, etc) and I understand the use case for USB (keep the device powered so battery doesn't run down).\nWhat circumstances would bluetooth tethering be preferred to wifi and USB?\n\nA: I would imagine that Bluetooth tethering over WiFi or USB would be a matter of convenience, or if a device doesn't have the appropriate ports for USB.  Another thought, MiWi OnDemand (jailbreak only), when being used between multiple iOS devices, will connect to a paired iPhone for internet connectivity over Bluetooth only when needed.  I suppose that Bluetooth is more on-demand whereas using your phone as a constant WiFi access point would drain the battery considerably faster.\n\nA: When I'm without AC power, I will generally use Bluetooth over USB. This is because my Mac's battery gets drained while charging the iPhone's battery. Between the Mac's own needs and the iPhone, the battery drains too quickly. When I have AC, this isn't an issue.\n\nA: You can initiate Bluetooth tethering from your Mac while your phone is in standby mode. It's quite convenient since you don't have to take the phone out from your pocket or purse.\n", "Q: ERROR 1013 Restoring iPhone 4 I have a MacBook 2.4 Intel Core 2 Duo version 10.6.6 i updated the iTunes to the newest version 10.2.1 & and an iPhone 4 .. when i was updating to the newest software of the iPhone a error occurred 1013, i went to the apple store and they change my phone.. i came back to restore the iPhone again (the new one) and the same error happened is it my iTunes or my computer making my phone break down?\n\nA: According to the Apple Support forums, it looks like a fix for this is to comment out gs.apple.com in your hosts file. \nComment it out in /etc/hosts by doing the following (taken from that page):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Hold down COMMAND + SHIFT keys and press 'G'\n\n*Enter \"/private/etc/\" in the field and press \"Go\"\n\n*Find \"hosts\" file in the directory\n\n*Drag the file to your desktop\n\n*Open it in text editor\n\n*Remove the line that has gs.apple.com entirely or put a # at the beginning of it to comment it out\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Drag it back to the /private/etc/ folder.\n\n*You'd need to enter your username and password to authenticate the move\n\n", "Q: What is the md5/sha1 checksum for Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS 4.3 SDK final?

This way you won't kill your program by quitting Terminal or closing the window.\nBe sure to also note what the standard flags are set when you double-click the application in the Finder (I've seen about 4 or 5 standard ones) and pass them too for consistent behavior.\nAs for what you want to do, check the documentation for the application in question.\nI don't know if that is the right flag for Chrome, so I can't comment there.\n\nA: This DOESN'T enable you to send an argument to the application, but I found my way to this thread trying to find a way to open an application from the command line so will at least share how to do that in case anyone else ends up in the same position.\nIt might work to make an alias in ~/.bash_profile. \nFor example:\nalias affinity=\"open -a Affinity\\ Designer.app\"\n\n(No path necessary. Hmm.)\nWorks for something like:\n$ affinity path/to/file.png\n\n", "Q: google chrome get's a \"Do you really want to start\" prompt, but it's installed I have a mac pro with the latest mac os x, I have google chrome installed since 23 oct 2010 and still everyday when I open it mac os x ask me \"Do you really want to open this software, it was downloaded from the internet 23 oct 2010\" which is really annoying since it's my preferred browser.\nI'm sorry that the message is in swedish but it's my fathers computer.\n\n\nA: Try executing from the Terminal the following command:\nsudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/\n\n(it might ask you for your password, that's ok)\nThis basically clears the quarantine flag in the metadata for the file (this is not a flag in the file itself so it doesn't get carried away when you move or copy the file to another machine)\n\nA: Building up on Martin's questions and the comments.\nTry to log from your father's account and open Google Chrome from there. It should ask you one last time to confirm, then, because it's an administrator's account, it will successfully clear the quarantine flag and you won't see it again (on either account) for Google Chrome.\n", "Q: Folder navigation using keyboard in Coda I'm trying to navigate on Coda using only the keyboard, but I can't seem to find the shortcuts. You can expand a folder by pressing the right arrow key, but I can't seem to mimic double clicking using the keyboard.\nWhen you double click, you actually enter the context of that particular folder. It would also be good to know how to navigate to the parent folder.\n\nA: Found it!\nCmd+Up and Cmd+Down to navigate between folders.\n", "Q: Making changes to a Smart Group's distribution list persistent Is there a way to make changes to a Smart Group's distribution list persistent?\nProblem Description\nIn Address Book, I right-click on a Smart Group and select \"Edit Distribution List\".\n\nI then select a work address for a contact that has multiple email addresses. \n\nIf I close the the \"Edit Distribution List\" menu and then go back into it, my change from home/other to work for that particular user did not persist.\nThe problem is that when I send an email using a smart group, I cannot ensure that everyone will receive the email to their work email address.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Distribution lists are not persisted for smart groups. On Lion, if you search Address Book help for \"distribution list\", you will see a page called \"Select addresses for group members\". Below step 2 is this piece of bad news: \"You can't choose smart groups.\"\nSome versions of OS X show smart groups in the Edit Distribution List window, but as of Lion, this is simply the user interface being misleading.\nSpeaking of Lion, users who use iCloud for contacts will see the Edit Distribution List menu item disabled, because this feature is not yet available with iCloud.\n", "Q: Un-integrate Parallels for Mac OS X When installing Parallels in Mac OS X 10.6 I believe I chose to integrate Windows XP with OS X. Some files are now associated with programs in Windows even though there are OS X equivalents. This is annoying because it is easy to accidentally open Parallels and Windows. Very annoying. \nSo my question is: can I un-integrate Parallels?\n\nA: Power off your VM, open Parallels Desktop, select the VM you wish to modify then in the menu bar select Virtual Machine -> Configure...\nYou'll get a Options window where you can change all the settings of the VM.  Specifically to your application problem, you can modify those settings underneath Options -> Applications.  I'd uncheck \"Share Windows applications with Mac\".\nAfter completing that step you'll need to manually rebuild the LaunchServices database.

I've been reading , a bit about users noticing a severe drop in battery life when using Google Chrome.\nI'm curious if this is a real issue - and attributed to the rendering/flash engine it uses.\n\nA: Battery Life is different than Battery Duration. Battery life will be tied to the maintenance and usage you give to a battery. To put it simply, if your battery is designed to be charged 100 times before it dies (cycles), then using the 100 charges in one month will be the same as using them in 1 year. (or almost the same, since there will be a small loss of power when the battery is idle).\nWhat I mean is, the battery life shouldn't be greatly affected by any application's usage pattern. But…\nThe truth is that battery duration is definitely affected by the power consumption. In other words: the more the power your computer uses, the less the batter will last with charge, before it requires to be recharged. \nWith that logic in mind, Chrome is a moderately CPU intensive application on its own (a tradeoff that is inherited by its One Process Per Tab design). It taxes your hardware a little bit more when creating new tabs and it uses slightly more RAM in order to keep things smooth. In exchange, you have a very solid -hard to crash- browser that will be able to keep working even if some of its tabs are literally dead. \nDespite that, however, Chrome has Flash (as an extension you can disable). It uses the \"same\" Flash, but bundled internally. If chrome uses some more battery (something that I have yet to see in real life), Flash uses probably all the battery you can throw at it, but not because Flash needs battery, it's because it needs CPU power, a lot, all the time. CPU power needs electricity. Batteries have Electricity. In the absence of a power outlet, guess who's there to provide juicy power to that hungry CPU? Yes, mamma battery. \nSo Flash will definitely decrease your battery charge duration (and in turn, it will force you to cycle charge your battery more often, therefore decreasing its life), but this will also happen on Safari, Camino, Firefox and possibly other applications or browsers that use Flash. \n\nA: I'm not familiar with any issues with the MacBook.  With a MacBook Pro (15\" or 17\" mid-2010 model and later), Chrome forces the use of the nVidia graphics card which drains the battery quicker than if it were running off the Intel HD graphics card.\nI've been using gfxCardStatus (http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus) to correct the issue.  I have it set to force Intel HD Graphics mode when running off the battery.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43138\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45457\n\nA: Same with the MacBook Pro 2011 (I have 15\"). Working from Safari yields more battery than with Chrome and this is with Integrated graphics being forced using Cody's program.\nThe multi process and \"more memory up front\" design are what add to the drain. Don't get me wrong, it's a great browser but the reason it's great is that it requires slightly more resources up front compared to other browsers.\n\nA: Apparently, Chrome 16 resolves this issue to some degree. Earlier versions of Chrome always forced the discrete video card to be activated, while Chrome 16 appears to enable discrete graphics when necessary (e.g. playing Flash), but it will leave the integrated graphics system active when higher graphics power is not needed.\n\nA: Google Chrome drops my battery down to 2 hours on my brand new MacBook Pro 13. When I quit Chrome and switch to Firefox, battery goes up to 6 hours. I don't need any geeky explanation to prove the opposite, Google Chrome is definitely using A LOT more resources than Firefox. Safari is not too different from Chrome, since they both use WebKit engine.\n\nA: I downloaded gfxcardstatus and there is no longer power based GPU switching. Additionally, it does not allow you to choose the Intel graphics card when Google Chrome is running. Google Chrome has 3 processes preventing the switch from Nvidia to Intel, which is probably what's consuming some power. I am going to switch to Firefox for a while, as the 3 hours I get on the battery is very little compared to the 6 I used to get on my MacBook, even though I really like Google Chrome.\n", "Q: How can I remove email addresses from Mail's autocomplete? How do remove or erase the emails that I use befor on iPad email, they are not on my contacts. As soon I start typing one email address I get a bunch of old address..how can I erase or remove that.\n\nA: I've had this same concern and from what I understand Apple does not provide a method to accomplish this cleanup. There are many threads in Apple Support discussion board and they always end suggesting to email Apple the request for this ability.\nHowever, if you own a PC, this gem popped up:\nCan't delete Unwanted Email addresses, Auto-fill in saves them all !\n\nA: I found this on a different question.\n\nOpen Mail.app. In the bar up top click on Window and you'll see in the drop down menu Previous Recipients click on that and a list of emails opens up that your system uses as it's preferred email address. That means you get to type one or two letters and \"it\" fills in the rest of the wording for you.\nYou have to erase these every time you enter in a new address for someone.\nOtherwise your system keeps putting in old addresses when you try to email someone even though you put in the correct email address into contacts and may even have erased the old addresses.\n\n\nA: When you start typing the email address, you get a list of suggested addresses. Tap on the circled i symbol on the right and then tap on „Remove from Recents“ at the bottom.\n", "Q: MacbookPro 13 or 15 2010 for software development From my own research and asking on other Mac forums. The answer to my question seem to be split. People who prefer mobility chose 13 over 15 and people who like better screen resolution pick 15. \nHow about this? If you going to dual boot OS X/Win7 and do .Net development on Win7 and PHP/Ruby on OS X. Is Core2duo enough for it?\n\nA: It's a little tricky to see what your question is here so I'll give my views but my short answer is that 15 inch will be a better experience but not in the sense that a 13\" MBP could not do what you need at all.\nDual-boot will be fine although I find OSX much more efficient in terms of resource needs. You'll have no problems doing web development using either of those two frameworks on either OS.\nAs for mobility, the weight and size difference seems negligible when carrying it around but once it is sat down in front of you, the extra screen space is useful.\n\nA: I am going to touch only the screen size aspect of this question. Having used a 13\" white MacBook entirely for development and work (and everything else in between) for over two years, I have often found myself severely crippled by the amount of space available on my screen. Everything is fine when I am editing a single source file without needing to look at another piece of file, but when I have to reference another file or piece of documentation or a set of windows, I do feel frustrated. Often, when that happens, I feel slightly unproductive. When I do XCode development, I naturally want the XCode to maximize itself, what with the editor taking space on the right side and the project/file browser on the left. That may seem fine, and it is, but if you throw XCode developer documentation window in the mix, you start to feel a bit of frustration. And if you migrate to the world of Interface Builder development, oh dear, you will feel even more frustrated as Interface Builder is notorious for spewing countless windows all over the place (I may be exaggerating, but it indicates the level of agitation I feel at times). I am personally of the opinion that a 15\" makes up for a good development machine in terms of screen real estate that it provides, at a very, very minor risk of hurting the mobility aspect of the laptop. \n\nA: I have a 15\" MBP (last gen, not this gen).  I topped it out with the faster CPU, faster HD, and upgraded the RAM to 8GB.  I'm glad I did, because I run VMs all the time, and the RAM + CPU has made a big difference.  I haven't checked out the new laptops yet, but last gen's couldn't be upgraded to the same capacity (at least in terms of CPU, IIRC), so I'm glad I went with what I did.\n", "Q: Synchronise/Merge MP3 collections without duplication or huge copies I have one drive containing about 90GB of MP3s which is used at home, it serves three Squeezebox players though the Slimserver software running on one of the desktop Macs.\nI have a separate firewire drive containing about the same amount of music which I am very slowly cleaning up with Song Genie and I've finished the process of getting all the covers in better than 300x300 using CoverScout. Good tools if you are prepared to work more or less manually, they can come up with some pretty strange suggestions for covers & tag info at times. All this is from CDs I have in storage and I've even scanned some of the covers I couldn't find online. It's a long-term project and one day I want to know all of it is perfect.\nSome of the music on the home collection isn't on my firewire drive, and vice versa. If I copy all of the firewire contents over the home collection that would probably work. However I'd really like to know what music is in the home collection that I haven't got because there's no way I'm copying un-tagged un-covered music over my fixed versions. \nI could copy all the firewire drive MP3s over the home drive, then call the home drive contents the new cleanest and completest version but copy 90GB twice seems like a waste of time and there must be a clever way to do it?\n\nA: Sounds like you need a merge/sync solution.  I personally often use arRsync - but there are lots.  Find one that allows you to prioritize one folder over the other when a match is found.  You may need to tag and apply album art to both copies, before they will be recognized as the same, though.\n", "Q: My mac has 64-bit EFI, but it only boots with 32-bit kernel I followed the guide at\nhttp://macperformanceguide.com/SnowLeopard-64bit.html\nto boot into 64-bit mode. I had no problems with the instructions and on the boot screen it says \"PAE enabled, 64bit mode enabled\" but when the system boots, both uname -a and System Profiler tell me that it has booted into 32-bit mode.\nI really need to boot into the 64-bit kernel, what should I do?\nSystem is MacBook Unibody (Early 2009, 6 GB RAM, 2.4 Intel CPU, 10.6.6)\n\nA: 64-bit Mac CPUs cannot boot 64-bit kernel due to one of the following reasons:\n\n*\n\n*The machine has 32-bit EFI.\n\n*The machine’s model is prohibited from booting K64 through a hardcoded list\nwithin the boot loader. (The list excludes \"non-Pro\" machines.)\n\nBoth limitations are artificial and imposed by Apple, although the first one is important because if a 32-bit EFI were allowed to boot the kernel wouldn't be able to use firmware services.\nIF you really, really, really want to boot these machines with a 64-bit kernel, you'll need to perform hackery on /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi. This is quite risky. More info:\nLink\n\nA: 64-bit kernel mode is not supported on any of the MacBooks (see Apple's KB article #HT3770), even if they have a 64-bit CPU and 64-bit EFI firmware.  I don't know why it's not possible to boot them 64-bit, but I haven't found a way to do it (I'm in the same boat, as I have a 2007 MacBook Pro, also 64-bit EFI, but Apple only supports 64-bit kernel on the MacBook Pros introduced in 2008 or later).\n\nA: There is a plist at /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist which controls which kernel gets used at boot time. \nYou can hold 6 & 4 to boot into 64-bit kernel mode while booting. Also, you can boot 32-bit by holding 3 & 2 while booting. Or you can try\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64\n\nand then reboot.\n\nA: I have the same computer as you.\nThere is no way to boot in 64 bit mode.\nI tried modifying so many system files. It cannot be done, and it does not need to be.\n\nA: MacBooks like yours are artificially prohibited by Apple from booting the 64 bit kernel.  This restriction is in the boot.efi.  To bypass this restriction in the current 10.10.3 boot.efi you must do the following.\n1) Create a copy of the boot.efi file and name it boot64.efi (boot.efi is usually located in /System/Library/CoreServices/   or on your esp partition\n2) Using a hex editor search for the string 20 00 40 02 and replace it with 40 00 80 04\n3) Save the boot64.efi file\n4) bless the boot64.efi\n5) sudo nvram boot-args=\"arch=x86_64\"\n6) reboot\n", "Q: time capsule router history log Does the time capsule router log web history?

Expand your question to include your needs and someone may be able to help you further.\n", "Q: Map Navigation Application that Builds on Top of Google Maps Is there a map navigation application ( GPS app) that is built on top of google maps? Something like papago, but it is too expensive for my taste.\nIt would be better if that GPS can alert me on the current road condition ( whether there is a massive traffic jam ahead of current route) and suggest me alternative. \nEdit: If GPS apps are not allowed to build on top of Google Maps, is there a GPS app that can check on traffic condition and suggest me alternative route?\nI'm living in Malaysia, if that's important to answer the question. \n\nA: Navigation implies turn-by-turn directions. When iOS 4 was announced, Apple stated that background navigation was one of the \"poles in the tent\" (one of the big 6 new features that made up the iOS 4 upgrade). However, per their licensing agreement, developers are NOT allowed to leverage Google Maps when building driving direction applications. They must build off their own data. That is why all the other apps you see (TomTom, Navigon, OpenStreetMap, etc.) all look unique, and have their own data.\n\nA: Currently both Google Maps and Waze provide turn by turn navigation.\n", "Q: If I buy Angry Birds on iPad and iPhone, do I have to buy it again on the Mac App Store? I just wanted to be able to play on a bigger screen... but have already paid $4.99 for Angry Bird on iPad.  It is the exact same game (same content) on the Mac... do I have to pay again actually?  (if the answer is yes or no, can you quote some source for reference?)  thanks.\n\nA: I don't have a source, but the thing is that the iPad/iPhone AppStore is different than the Mac Apple Store. The iPhone game costs 0.99, whereas the iPad version (optimized for the larger screen) is more expensive, yet these two apps are in the same Store.\nSince there's no way (thanks the Apple) to provide free upgrades to the Mac Apple Store for existing customers, Rovio charges you for the game again if you want it in your Mac, no matter how easy it was to port for them. \nIt was probably not a super hard task, but in terms of administrative work, they have no choice unless they'd wanted to give it away for free, which clearly they aren't. \nSo the answer is yes, you have to buy it again from the Mac Apple Store.\n\nA: Yes, they're different products, so they are purchased separately. Just as Angry Birds HD (iPad) is a separate product from Angry Birds (iPhone/iPod touch), the Mac version is a different application. \n", "Q: Sharing internet from macbook to iphone I've got a problem with sharing internet connection from my macbook pro to iphone.\nI've shared Ethernet connection in System Preference and managed to connect to the network from my iPhone but has no internet connection on the iPhone\nI assume that the problem is because my macbook's Ethernet connection uses proxy. I tried to enabled auto in proxy setting on iPhone but it didn't help.\nSo the question is how to set up internet connection sharing under conditions described above. Thanks in advance. \n\nA: If you can access the Internet successfully on your Mac, you can share it to your iPhone. Your Mac just essentially acts as the router. So make sure you can access the net successfully on your Mac first. Then go to Sharing and turn on Internet Sharing, choosing to share the Ethernet connection via the Airport. Now connect to the adhoc network that's been created using your iPhone.\n\nA: Since Dmytro said that the answer from superuser worked, I'm posting it as an answer here...\n\nFirst, try entering the proxy settings for your connection into the iPhone. You can do this by going into the Settings app > Wifi > Wifi network name > Proxy (which is at the bottom). Note, you cannot specify a .pac proxy file like this on the iPhone.\nUnfortunately, this may not work. I had the exact same problem for me, and although it would work fine with my DSi, for some reason, my iPod touch hated the ad-hoc connection.\n\n\nA: I am only going to chime in to share a link to the Apple KB article which describes how to share an Internet connection on Mac: Sharing your Internet connection\n\nA: Go to Settings- General-Reset-Reset Network Settings. It worked for me.\n", "Q: Restoring hidden apps to a home screen I used up all the space on my 11 home screens with apps, then installed another app (which can only be found through search as it's installed 'offscreen'). To make more space, I put a lot of different apps into folders.\nHow do I restore the hidden app back to a home screen?\nIf I reset the home screens then my folders are lost and an app will be off screen again, and I'd be back to square one.\nRunning iPhone 4, iOS 4.3.\n\nA: You can rearrange your applications from within iTunes and then Sync.\nConnect your iPhone and open iTunes, then click on your phone and then Apps:\n\nAlso, consider using folders to organize your apps.\n\nOrganize apps into folders with drag-and-drop simplicity. Get faster access to your favorites and browse and manage thousands of apps.\n\n\nA: There's actually an easier way to do this, and it doesn't require connecting to iTunes. \nIf you have extra space on a screen, as it sounds like the OP had after arranging their apps into groups (folders), all you need to do is to reboot your phone, and the app will reappear in one of the blank spaces on the screen.\nYou can use either a soft reboot or a hard (RAM) reboot to do this, so it's as complicated as turning off your phone and turning it back on again.\nIf anyone would like to test this, I have a known, reproducible bug in iOS 6 for throwing an icon \"off-screen\" that I can share.\n\nA: If you don't have any critical data in that app, the easiest way to do this is probably to uninstall it (uncheck it in the Apps list in iTunes under your iPhone, then sync) and reinstall it (recheck it, resync).\n\nA: If you grouped enough apps together for create a blank page in the middle, the iPhone will condense the pages bring all the apps over one page.\nFor example if you freed up page 9 (made it blank) everything on page 10 would now be on page 9, everything on page 11 would now be on page 10, and everything that was hidden off screen on the missing page 12, should now be on page 11.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: It might sound stupid but sometimes when you re-load your new iPhone the apps get put on the farthest screens while your second screen might only show an app or two.  Swipe over and your apps will be there.\n\nA: Reset home screen layout;under the reset tab.\n\nA: Creating a space on the home screen where the app disappeared and then turning off my phone worked perfectly. The missing app was right there. All good \n\nA: Go into the App Store, click on Purchases at the top of the page, and you will see all the apps you ever downloaded.

Then you could simply copy the app to your main MacBook Air drive.\nStandard Reinstall - If you have to reinstall the OS over your current system, it isn't as painful as on Windows if that is what you are used to.

I presume you could do the same with an install stick.  This could work if Mail has its own installer; but it's fairly tightly tied into iCal, Address Book, and who-knows-what else, so it may not.  I've only done this with more self-contained applications.\n\nA: If one of your friends has a MacBook at the same version of OS, Simply copy Mail.app from his/her machine.\n", "Q: What can change so the app store fails on a network where purchases used to work fine?

If I try to download the Free (but pay to upgrade) app Hunters: Episode One HD on my iPad it does not work\n\nA: You should be able to filter your firewall logs down to requests originating from your computer/your phone's local IP address, and look it it's outgoing requests.\nI'm pretty sure all that app download traffic takes place over bog standard HTTPS, 443/tcp. \nEnsure all apps have stopped running, open App Store, move over to the Updates category, wait for all traffic (app image requests and the like) to die down, then tap update. The next series of requests should fail, and you should have the reason relevant to your own configuration.\n", "Q: Streaming a movie to my iPhone 3GS through ITunes Is there any way to stream a video from my iTunes library to my iPhone 3GS? I have a couple of videos sitting in the 'Movies' folder of my iTunes, but when I start up my iPhone iPod application, it doesn't show anything in the 'Video' tab. What am I doing wrong?\nFor completeness, I'm using a PC.\n\nA: With iOS 4.3 you can enable home sharing while you are in the same wifi network. First make sure home sharing is running in iTunes. Then on your iPhone go to Settings - iPod, and then enter your home sharing account info. \nThen, when you go to the iPod app, you can select the shared library. \nAs long as these videos are encoded the correct way, they should play through home sharing by streaming to your phone. I have tried this with music and movies on my iPhone and iPad.\n\nA: Air Video can stream any movies on your computer (including in iTunes) to your iPhone, over WiFi and 3G. It'll even do real-time transcoding, so if the video is in a format the iPhone can't normally play, it'll convert it in real-time.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that videos purchased through the iTunes Store are DRMed, and as such 3rd party programs can't typically stream them. Air Video will setup a direct stream of the file to your phone, going through Safari. The problem with this is that the usual over-the-air encryption can't take place (because Air Video can't read the DRMed file), so your computer streams the entire file. If it's a big HD file, this will chew up a lot of bandwidth, and take a long time to start.\n\nA: I am not familiar with streaming videos through iTunes, I use PLEX.\nIts a free media server for Mac, and they have a $4.99 client for iDevice, it works great and is able to read your iTunes library.\nWas also EXTREMELY simple to set up.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: DVD to iPod touch (iTunes)? I have a big pile of DVDs and DivX encoded files with animation shorts that I sometimes would like to watch on my iPod touch 4G while I am on the go. What would be a quick and easy way to transfer the movies to iTunes and then to my iPod touch? Sometimes the DVD has a menu that list all the shorts, I would like to have each short as a separate files (or \"item\" in iTunes). \nIs there also a way to (automagically) optimize the movies for viewing on the iPod (i.e. adjust quality and resolution for the small iPod touch screen and for better battery life).\nThis would be ideal: iTunes is my main repository for all my movies in the best possible quality so they'd also work on the large screen. Once they are copied over to an iPod they get reencoded with lesser bitrate and resolution.\n\nA: The best, or, most commonly used method for transcoding DVDs and DivX files to an iPod would be Handbrake.  Handbrake has presets for almost all current iDevices.  I'd start by reading the Handbrake Mac GUI Guide and selecting iPod Touch from the destination presets (image on Stage 2 from the guide) and adjusting select a target bit rate of 700ish for a device with that small of a screen.\nIf you're interested in scripting out the process to save time Handbrake has a great CLI and guide that would streamline the process.\nAnother popular solution would be MacTheRipper. \n\nA: I don't think iTunes has any facility to automatically re-encode video files as they sync. You'll need to keep two copies on hand: your originals on DVD or in DivX format, and another (smaller) copy in H.264 format. (There are other video codecs that will work, but as long as this is specific for your touch, you might as well use the codec that'll take up the least space.) \nTo rip DVDs: Handbrake with VLC if needed (violating copyright law is bad, but I'm not your mother, so I don't care)\nTo re-encode the video, you might as well use Handbrake as long as you've got it sitting around.\n\nA: Media Converter\nFree, open source and as lean as it gets. You select the target device, drag your media on to it, and it goes to town. Not a lot of options to get in the way and the defaults are what most people want, most of the time. They even have shareable presets so if you hit upon a particularly nice combination you can pass it along, and vice versa.\n\n\nA: DVD discs are formatted in VOB file and this is not a supported file type for iPod. The best way to watch DVD on iPod is to change the video format to mp4, m4v or mov which are compatible with all apple devices.\n", "Q: How do I see just unread junk? Greetings. I want to be able to have a view of just the unread messages in the Junk folder. Thunderbird has a nice way to do this (essentially, \"show only unread\" while in the folder view), but I don't see anything similar in Mail.app. Further, when I try to make a Smart Mailbox whose two rules are \"Message is unread\" and \"Message is in Mailbox - Junk\", it never finds anything, even when Mail.app knows there is unread messages there because it shows a count.\nAny clues would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: For some reason or another, Apple has made it impossible to access junk messages from a Smart Mailbox.\nIf you are able to set Message is in Mailbox to Junk, you must be setting it to a special 'Junk' mailbox that you have created (or that was created automatically by whatever email service you connect to). So, messages in Mail's built-in Junk folder won't appear in your mailbox.\nHowever, you can get around this without too much trouble. To do this, make a Mail rule that automatically moves junk mail to your special Junk mailbox. Here's how:\nGo to Mail-> Preferences-> Rules. Click Add Rule. Set the description to something like Move to special Junk. Set the popup in the first box to Message is Junk Mail. Set the first popup in the second box to Move message, and use the second popup to select your special junk box.\nNow, any incoming messages that Mail thinks are junk will go to your special junk mailbox. You can use this one in a Smart Mailbox.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How can I run Flash applications on iOS? How can I run Flash applications on iPad?\n\nA: On a non jailbroken iDevice, your best options are either the SkyFire browser or the iSwifter app. SkyFire works only for video and iSwifter does work for some Flash content, but neither is a perfect solution, in my opinion. (iSwifter tends to have some funny browser behavior when it comes to touch input.)\nAlternatively, you can install \"Frash\" on to a jailbroken iDevice. I've had varied success with this, however. Some flash apps work fine, most work to some degree, and then some don't work at all. There's no real guarantee what will or won't work with it (just as there isn't a guarantee of what will or won't work with iSwifter or SkyFire).\n\nA: It appears that you can install Flash on a jailobroken iPhone.\nGizmodo article here, which links to the real article (from Redmond Pie).\nThe process looks reasonably involved, but it's got a how-to video to help you through it.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Is there a way to add shortcuts to open a particular folder in Save Dialogs and Finder Windows? I know that when you're saving or opening a file ⌘ shift D shoots you to the Desktop folder, and pressing ⌘ shift D whilst using finder shoots you to the desktop folder as well. \nIs there a way to create a custom shortcut to jump to your own choice of folder? (e.g. ⌘ shift W for your 'Work' folder).\n\nA: By default, no.  What I've done is drag folders I access frequently to the Places section in the left side bar.  There is software to accomplish this though.  Default Folder X does this, and more.\nIf you're in a save dialogue you can press / to get a file path dialogue, or press ⌘+Shift+G to get a \"Go to folder\" dialogue.\n\nA: Not a shortcut, but you can drag finder proxy icons (in the titlebar), folders and even files into open/save dialogues to jump to the folder (if you drag a file, the file name field will be prefilled with its file name).\n", "Q: Using a Bluetooth or USB remote to advance Keynote slides? What would it take technically for the iPad to be able to allow Keynote slides to be advanced by a remote (like this -  http://www.targus.com/us/productdetail.aspx?regionId=7&sku=AMP18US)?\nOr how about via Bluetooth?\n\nA: The 2Screens iPad app works with their iPhone remote app for Keynote, PowerPoint, and PDFs through wifi. Apple's Keynote Remote app on an iPhone also offers remote control through wifi.\n\nA: I’VE GOTTEN A REMOTE TO WORK WITH KEYNOTE ON IPAD\nI’m like everyone else wanting a remote to advance slides.

I'm a tech for my local school district and we are having some problems with our iMac Multimedia Lab. Over the past nine months, 5 of the 22 iMacs have suffered from filesystem corruption. The only recourse for these machines has been to completely wipe out the OS X partition and start fresh (with appropriate restore from Time Machine.)\nHere's the list for why I know it's file system corruption:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iMac will not boot OS X. I have seen it stop at the \"throbber\", the progress bar, or just the Apple logo.\n\n*Mounting the iMac disk via Target Disk Mode (love that feature) succeeds, but only for the Bootcamp partition. The OS X partition fails to mount.\n\n*A verify of the disk reveals the OS X partition needs to be repaired (I've seen invalid sibling entries, orphaned children etc.). Attempting to repair the disk fails. This latest attempt (just yesterday) said that the catalog B trees could not be rebuilt. I should have made more complete notes on what was said each time, but each time until this last one I assumed it was an odd one-in-a-million kind of event. A fluke\n\n*Attempting to repair or rebuild the drives with Drive Genius 3 also fails\nSo far 98% of the user's files have been recoverable via Data Rescue 3\nThe physical hard drive does not appear to be failing (retrieving files from the drive does not hang or \"beachball\", the drive does not appear and disappear in Disk Utility, Finder remains responsive, etc.)\n\n*Normally I'd chalk it up to a series of bad drives. Just happened to be the unlucky guy who purchased a bad run of iMacs, right? Here's where things start to get interesting. I submit to you, the list of oddities:\n\n*The drives verify as good via SMART\n\n*The RAM checks out\n\n*After deleting and re-creating the partition (and re-installing OS X) all problems disappear.\n\n*The corruption has not happened to the same Mac twice\n\n*Bootcamp is installed on the same drive and functions before, after, and during the corruption on the Mac side.\n\n*The Bootcamp partition has not had this issue on ANY of the iMacs\n\n\nAlso, to rule out the obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*There have been no brownouts or surges\n\n*We seriously doubt a virus, as the malfunctions appear anywhere from simultaneously (two machines went down at the same time about a month ago) to months apart. Plus, the user's documents are restored after reformat, so one would surmise that if it were a malicious program the Mac would keep failing again and again.\n\n*The machines have been in a climate-controlled area\n\n*It has not been the same user affected\n\n*Sometimes the problem occurs after an unavoidable hard shutdown (which occurs only infrequently. These machines are not being excessively powered down improperly. Only what you would expect with a Mac Lab running multimedia five days a week), other times it is completely out-of-the-blue\nFrequently used software includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhoto\n\n*iDVD\n\n*iMovie\n\n*Safari\n\n\nThe machines are also loaded with Parallels 5, which loads the Bootcamp partition into a VM. Parallels was setup via the standard wizard, no oddball configuration or hacks.\nAnd last but not least, the specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac 10,1 (21.5 inch)\n\n*Stock drives\n\n*OS X Snow Leopard (latest updates)\n\n*Stock memory\n\n*Joined to our Active Directory infrastructure\n\n*HFS+ file system (not case sensitive, the default for OS X Snow Leopard)\n\n*No out-of-the-ordinary drive maint. programs. Drive Genius was loaded yesterday afternoon (AFTER recovering from the latest failure) to run a verification on all iMacs, but was not installed prior. All Macs, both those that have failed in the past and those that have never failed, passed with flying colors.\n\n\nTL;DR: The OS X partition has become corrupted on five different iMacs, but the physical drives are fine. WHY!?!?!\n\nA: HFS Plus (HFS+) is a fragile and a little outdated filesystem. If you google it, you'll find many reports of filesystem corruption.\nRebooting without unmounting the filesystem is the best way to corrupt it. This happens when the mac freezes for some reason (in my case it's the nvidia video card) or power failures.\nHere are some tips, that IMHO should lower the chance of filesystem corruption:\n\n\n*\n\n*When system freezes, try rebooting from ssh. When the graphics subsystem of my mac freeses, it's still accessible via SSH - try opening ssh connection from your network and reboot it. You could use Apple Remote Desktop (€62) for this task. You should enable ssh access first.\n\n*Do diskutil verifyVolume / periodically. Yes, even if HFS+ is a journaled filesystem, corruption is possible. You could use Apple Remote Desktop to run this on all classroom computers at once.\n\n*Use multiple volumes. Using multiple volumes should reduce chance for corruption. Splitting / from /Users/ should make restoration easier (either / or /Users will be corrupted). Note that this probably could complicate things with Bootcamp.\n\n*Mount partition(s) with options, which reduce writing. Mounting partitions with noatime option should reduce writing on it. By default every time  a file is accessed, it's access timestamp is \"touched\".\n\n*Make sure there are no attempts to mount HFS+ partition from other os-es. Is it possible that someone is starting a linux distro from usb/dvd and mounting / in rw mode or playing with journal settings?\nHope my answer is helpful.\nPS: corruption usually is gradual not sudden. There is a possibility that something specific is causing this, software or workflow. My mind is at Parallels 5, but it should corrupt the bootcamp volume, not the MacOS one. Searching their KB does not reveal anything useful.\nPPS: it is fragile because it has no actual system to correct corruption within a file. A journal records transfers and attempts to recopy data in order to return the filesystem to a consistent state but if the file lost is vital (like actual filesystem structure data) then there is no recourse. In fact, because the Catalog File (which is lists all the logical data information) is stored as a file, if it corrupted in certain places your entire filesystem is rendered useless garbage data, or partially tended garbage in the event that it is corrupted and the a journal replay occurs which causes it to restructure the filesystem in a way that is not consistent with the data (e.g. file a and b are 1MB and 2MB respectively  but the replay changes them to be 2MB and 1MB resulting in half of the contents of B being inside A).\n\nA: Things that could do it off the top of my head...\nyou said you haven't had power surges or brownouts. How are you confirming it? We had a classroom where PC power supplies were blowing seemingly at random. We had to have maintenance staff connect a monitoring meter to the circuit and discovered that outlet is having huge voltage spikes.\nMemory isn't seated properly and corrupting data.\nDrive cables loose.\nmarginal hard disks that have a bad set of sectors but not bad enough that it's triggering alerts or scans for bad sectors.\nSomething in the Windows side via bootcamp is modifying the drive in a way the drive doesn't like. Copy protection? Drive utilities?\nYou said it's in a lab. What are the students running? Are you monitoring or locking down what can be executed that could be doing it?\nYou've said this seems to be random, no two machines having this happen in a row. This would lead me to suspect that either a student or group of students are causing it or there is a random power issue in the lab causing it. Is there a way of tracking who last used the machines to see if this issue seems to magically follow one of your users?\n\nA: Have you considered a periodic check of the machines? You could easily schedule weekly fsck verification passes (until you figure out why the corruption is happening) and then monthly to keep a tab on things.\nWith a journaled file system, it takes some repeated bad treatment for macs to degrade to the point of not booting. Even bad software doesn't write to the system side of booting, so I would suspect something is clearly amiss. On macs that get shut down cleanly and get attention the whenever minor filesystem errors are repaired (any time a mac restarts and fsck isn't running in preen mode is a sign of trouble on the horizon).\nWith a deployment of 25 macs, you can easily spend some time being proactive about file system checks and seeing which are not powering down cleanly by setting up a syslog server  or other centralized auditing system.\n\nA: I would consider student activity.  If you are running bootcamp and OS X, then I bet the students are crashing the Mac side to run boot camp, because they aren't patient.  This can also be the case if there is a screen locker present.\nI suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove boot camp.  Instead run a VM either under Parallels or Virtual Box.  (I have found that Windows XP under VirtualBox runs quite well.)  Configure this so that the Virtual Machine is immutable, stored locally on the old bootcamp partition.  This will prevent kids from screwing around with the windows install.  Redirect their home directory to read off of their Mac home directory on your server.  (This is a PITA to set up the first time, as it encompasses about a zillion regedits)\n\n*Establish some form of login monitoring so you know which students have used which machines.  This has the advantage that you can spot the same kid logging in on multiple machines, usually doing this as a favour for someone who is banned.   I set it up that when the same login was on two machines, both machines were rebooted.\n", "Q: How can I erase the history of passcodes on the iPhone4? I have an iPhone4 running version iOS 4.3.  It is not jailbroken.  I want to re-use a previous passcode (the 4 number code to unlock the screen).  How can I get the iPhone to forget all the passcodes I've used in the past?\n\nA: Many times password policies like this are enforced by looking at the most recent N passwords. For example, if a company requires changing your password every month, they may look at the last 12 passwords. I can't say for sure how it is implemented with the iPhone.\nA simple trick to get around this is to change your password N times so that the password you want gets knocked off the list and you can use it again. If you don't know what the rule is and how many recent passwords are stored, it may take some trial and error.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me.  I just change the password 5 times, then on the 6th it let me use my original again.\n\nA: Unless you're willing to jailbreak your only option is talk to your company's administrator. That policy is indeed enforced by the company, but maybe you're lucky and the responsible did it without caring too much about it. Anyways...\nFor changing the policy, try starting here.\nFor removing the policy with jailbreak, you'll have to read a lot.\nIf you your Hit Points are below zero, go to page 39. (joking)\n\nA: i reset my passcode 6 times, then reverted back to original. That worked. Not sure if the code then gets stored by 3rd party (in this case a linked email address to a work account)\n\nA: I had to change 10 times before it let me use my original one.  But then, no problem.\n", "Q: iPhone: WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular network not working I have iPhone 3GS and suddenly it's gone away. I mean WiFi, bluetooth is not working, and I can't make any calls.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\nAny help will be appreciated!\n\nA: Wow. Seems like the modem/baseband part is gone wrong. Try rebooting the phone. If still not working - backup your information (from iTunes) and try a restore to factory settings (I'm assuming a factory unlocked phone, no JB). If this doesn't help - probably it's a hardware failure.\nAbout the IMEI blockage - no, it's not the case.\n", "Q: What's the fastest connection speed / shortest elapsed time using Migration Assistant? When using Migration Assistant to move users, files, and folders from an old Mac to a new one, you have a few different choices, depending on the Macs involved. Presuming that both Macs have appropriate ports, which ports should be used in a real-world situation? Please do not provide quotations of theoretical port speeds; I'm looking for real-world experiences as to what will get the job done faster.\nPort choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*FireWire 400 in target disk mode\n\n*FireWire 400 to 800 in target disk mode\n\n*FireWire 800 in target disk mode\n\n*100 Megabit Ethernet to Gigabit Ethernet in the OS\n\n*Gigabit Ethernet to Gigabit Ethernet in the OS\n\n*Thunderbolt cable in target disk mode\n\n\nA: While the prevailing thinking that gigabit is faster than FW800 is true in the most rudimentary theory it doesn't hold up in practice. When migrating over Ethernet the source machine has the OS loaded, and is communicating over a chatty protocol designed for the wild unknown that is an open network. \nFirewire transfers with migration assistant are performed with the source machine in \"target disk\" mode... no OS is loaded, and it's essentially functioning as an external hard drive. \nIn my experience FW800 in target disk mode provides superior performance. \n\nA: I just transferred a 25GB user from a MacBook Pro 5,3 running 10.7.5 to a MacBook Pro 9,2 via Gigabit Ethernet (direct cable connection with self assigned IP addresses). It took 23 minutes although the time-remaining indicator going from 5 to 8 then dropping to zero for most of that time.\nI then transferred that same user from the MacBook Pro 9,2 in target disk mode to a MacBook Air 4,2 running 10.7.5 via a Thunderbolt and it took only 5 minutes with the time-remaining indicator dropping monotonically from 3 to 0.\nI conclude that Thunderbolt is much faster than Gigabit Ethernet.\n\nA: Gigabit ethernet to gigabit ethernet. Next would be FireWire 800 to FireWire 800. Thunderbolt target disk mode is testing to be equivalent to FireWire 800 in target disk mode. \nIt looks like the OS can keep a gigabit link fuller than target disk mode is able, even when the target mode link has vastly higher bandwidth available. \n\nA: Last time I updated my computer I tried over FireWire 400.  It said 23 hours, I cancelled it after four. I plugged in ethernet and the whole process took 23 minutes. Ethernet - Ethernet is faster than FireWire 400. \n\nA: Kinda depends on the drives involved. My migrations (I do these for all my family for every new Mac) go fastest through Thunderbolt when both ends are using Flash Storage, but have seemed to go faster by Gigabit Ethernet when its a Hard Drive to Flash Storage, and if it's Hard Drive to Hard Drive, I can't tell the difference between Gigabit Ethernet and Firewire 800.\nTarget disk mode is my go to for Mac to Mac migrations, the time I remember clocking it, I transferred 120gb from my MacBook Air 2011 to 2013 about 5 minutes faster when I did it Target Disk mode than when I redid it OS to OS.\nWhy I had to redo it, well, we don't talk about that ;) but it was a good opportunity to benchmark :)\n", "Q: Recursively converting files from dos line endings to unix line endings I am looking for a command that I could use to run on an entire directory and subdirectory that will convert all line endings from DOS to UNIX.\nIt should be able to detect if a file is text or binary.\nI installed dos2unix using macports but it looks that it does miss the recursive option.\n\nA: Try find . -name \"*\" -type f -exec dos2unix {} \\;.\n\nIn case dos2unix is not available on your system, you can use the following script (save as dos2unix and set as executable):\n#!/bin/sh\n\nperl -pi -e 's/\\r\\n/\\n/;' $*\n\n\nA: Here is one line shell code\nfind . -name \"*\" -type f -exec perl -pi -e 's/\\r\\n/\\n/;' {}  \\;\n", "Q: How much capacity is good for an iPad? Does one need 3G on it? My iPod Touch (8GB) always bothers me with lack of free space. And right now I'm considering buying the new iPad and would like to choose the right storage capacity. I'm trying to decide between 32 GB and 64 GB. Will 32 GB be short for anyone? Why?\nAlso, does one really need 3G on their iPad? I have a 3G phone (Android) which let's me create a hotspot for free. That's when on the move but most of the time I'm assuming I'll be in a Wifi enabled area. So is it right for me to not get 3G? Or are there scenarios that I'm missing? (I know I'll be using my phone's and iPad's batter when I'll tether.)\n\nA: I'm absolutely fine with a 32GB WiFi only iPad. 32GB is enough for most of my music, audio books, all the apps I use and some tv episodes. I never missed 3G on my iPad. Just one thing: you won't have GPS without 3G. If you have an iPhone, you can tether both, data and coordinates via WLAN (not bluetooth as previously said).\n\nA: If you plan to store videos on it and your whole music collection then go with either the 32GB or the 64GB. If you just going to use apps on it and do some reading then 16GB will be enough for you. \nI have the 32GB Wifi iPad since this summer and I still have about 15GB of empty storage. I also have an android phone with 3G data and tethering and I am quite happy with it. So 3G is not needed. \nI think the best is to choose the middle road and have a 32GB wifi iPad. \n\nA: 64 gigs is nice if you're on the road for extended periods and want to take several dozen movies along.\nIn the US, there are enough free wifi hotspots around so that, in town, you'll never lack for places where you can create a route map. It just takes a little more planning than with 3G.\n", "Q: How to show iOS screen on a projector like Steve Jobs did on his keynotes? How to show iOS screen on projector like Jobs did?

As I have scripts that rely on this path they can't work.\nFor example an afp share at afp://nas/Team is shown Team in Finder, but its real path is /Volumes/Team-1\n\nA: I have seen this happen when there is already a volume with the given name and the OS needs to create a new name to mount the volume as you can't have a duplicate name -- thus the suffix.\nThe first thing to do is, make sure that you don't have any other volumes with the same name. If you do, perhaps you can rename one or only use one at a time.\nI've also seen some applications that use a path for an external volume will create a folder under /Volumes/ if the volume has been disconnected and the path doesn't exist. This causes the suffix the next time the volume is reconnected. To fix this you will need to disconnect the volume, remove the extraneous folder, and then reconnect the volume. It should mount without the suffix.\n", "Q: What text editor under OS X can close current window when you press ESC key?

When using Shared Networking, Parallels creates a separate sub-network that is used between Parallels and your Mac. As such, your Mac will be using a different IP address to communicate with Parallels than it will to communicate with your external/local network.\nHere is an example configuration:\nMac\n\n\n*\n\n*Local Network IP: 192.168.1.10\n\n*Parallels Network IP: 10.211.55.2\n\n\nParallels\n\n\n*\n\n*Parallels Network IP: 10.211.55.3\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\n*\n\n*Parallels Default Gateway: 10.211.55.1\n\n\nBecause all of these IPs are non-routable, attempts to connect to your Mac using the 192.168.1.10 address will fail from Parallels. You will need to use the 10.211.55.2 address to connect to your Mac. Note that this is not the same as the Gateway address.\nIt is also worth pointing out that the IP address for the Parallels network is assigned via DHCP and has the potential to change. This means that you would need to change the entries in your hosts file.*\nAnd finally, make sure that Apache is listening on the Parallels Network IP address. The default configuration should listen on all ports, but would be worth checking if you have changed the Apache configuration.\n*There are instructions here to change the Parallels network adapter on the Mac to use a specific address, but this is for Tiger.\n", "Q: How to close the window and quit the application when you press ESC key under OS X?

I have an AppleTV2 hooked up to a Vizio LCD TV via HDMI. Nothing between the ATV and TV other than the HDMI cable. I just got the ATV2 a week ago and it was updated with the latest iOS update shortly after I got it, so I don't know if this issue is related to it or not.\nSometimes when I wake the ATV and try playing content the video is fine, but the audio is gone.\nI have switched HDMI ports and reseated the cables. Still the issue persists.\nI've been able to restore sound with mixed success by sleeping/waking the ATV, restarting the ATV, and turning off the TV and turning it back on. Just changing the inputs on the TV to another input and back again doesn't fix it. By mixed success I mean that I haven't found a magic sequence or method that will fix it consistently every time.\nThe sound does not cut out in the middle of something. It is only \"in the beginning\", making me think there's something with the HDMI handshake causing it. Once I can get the menu effects sounds while navigating the ATV I know that it'll be okay.\nI turned the ATV's Dolby setting from auto to off, but I'm not sure if it has fixed the issue (I don't think I restarted it since doing that and I just changed the setting yesterday after Googling around to see if this will improve sound stability.)\nBefore I try buying new cables or anything, is there a known issue regarding the latest iOS that has these symptoms?

If not, what are my options? I intend to use the PC card only when booting to Windows.\n2 - Power supply - Are there any PC PSUs that will work with this? What are my cheapest options?\n3 - CPU - Are the bare minimum CPUs the Wolfdale Xeons? Will any desktop CPUs be compatable? Does the machine need two physical CPUs to boot?\n\nA: You should be able to boot without a graphics card, but that will be an easy part to find.  The Wikipedia article is quite good about processor families so you have several options there. The apple power supplies are top notch, but you might find an equivalent. \nHave you considered buying a scrap Mac Pro for it's power supply? I would be hesitant to spend money if I were not sure of the provenance of the stripped Mac Pro you have. (If the Mac worked, why strip the CPU, GPU and power supply? )\nGood luck with your frankentosh!\n\nA: As far as number 1, yes, you can do this. Depending on the card, OS X may or may not boot properly with it in there. If it doesn't boot, you can always simply unplug the power to the card, and reboot - the 7300GT will work in another lane just fine. That's my current setup.\nNot 100% sure about the answers to your other two questions I'm afraid. However, Xlr8yourmac has a list of CPU upgrades for Intel Macs, and a section for Mac Pros, which might shed some light on the CPU issue, at least.\n", "Q: Can I add my own commands/scripts to the mail.app toolbar?

It references a page of links to articles/examples on writing Mail.app plugins.  You will also need to do some programming of Mail.app, e.g. using AppleScript - which you can learn more about here.\nHere is a year-and-a-half old blog post by a guy who managed to get some useful control over Mail.app from AppleScript.  You might use it as a model. He built his with a third-party module but you might find a way to write your own, if necessary.\nThe scripting of Mail.app might be stable.  However, from what I have read - the rules for how to construct a Mail.app plugin may be in flux from one major version of Mac OS X to the next.\nThat could be enough to discourage you from writing what you want for wide distribution but it might not be much of a handicap for personal use.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Automator \n\n*File -> New -> Service -> Choose\n\n*Service receive no input in Mail.app\n\n*From library select Utilities -> Run AppleScript\n\n*Insert the code provided below and save under name Move to trash [Gmail] \n\n*Edit the script and change your account name.

I use mysql and it takes up to 2.5 GB of my ram. I checked activity monitor and saw that I have 1GB of inactive memory but it never changes even if I have only 10MB active free memory. Is there any way to force the inactive memory to be used?\n\nA: You can think of inactive memory like free memory that's been reserved for a recently closed application, but ready to be consumed by other uses when the 'truly' free memory has been exhausted.  If you have 1 GB of memory (for the sake of making this discussion easier) on a freshly booted system, imagine the OS uses 300 MB and you open an app that uses 200 MB.  You now have a total of 500 MB used, and 500 free.  If you close that app that was using 200 MB, the memory is marked inactive and you'll now have 300 used (OS), 200 inactive, and 500 free.

The difference between Inactive and Free is that Inactive was recently used, so if you for example open iTunes and it uses 200MB, when you close it, the program gets closed, the memory of iTunes marked as Inactive but it remains like that unless its needed again. But if you happen to re-open iTunes, OS X knows that it's there already and inactive, so it marks it as active again and voilá, that was faster than having to reload it from the slower hard drive. \nProvide more information about your computer to help find the cause of your \"slow\" system.\nupdate: Here's more info about Memory and OS X (from Apple): \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1342\n", "Q: How can I automatically download lyrics in iTunes?

This will trigger the built-in PHP version by default instead of the one bundled with MAMP. If these are different the results can be unexpected.\nI would recommend using the default OSX versions of both Apache & PHP. After you got it all running the first time you really don't need a control panel or anything that much.\n\nA: Actually, the #1 advantage to using MAMP is tremendous: Each time you upgrade your system, your environment won't break!\nThere were a couple of Snow Leopard updates (or maybe it was Leopard to Snow Leopard, I can't remember) that broke Mysql. One was by moving the mysql.socket file. There was another update the broke PHP. In both cases I had to hunt around the Internet for hours to find obscure sites with info on how to fix them. \nWith MAMP you don't have this problem, you can install all your OS updates, or even wipe the hard drive and install from scratch (provided you make a backup of your MAMP application of course) and still have all your environment just like before. This is the main reason I use MAMP. I've been bitten by these problems too many times.\nDisadvantages:\nWhen compiling new stuff, you have to make sure you tell it to use the MAMP files and not the built-in ones. This can sometimes be a problem for some Rails bits (Phusion Passenger gem comes to mind that complains about not finding the apache sources). But depending on how much tinkering you are doing, MAMP is a godsend. \nWith regards to having stuff duplicated on your drive, the solution is very simple, just delete the builtin installations that bother you, I got rid of /usr/local/Mysql to avoid conflicts. Though I wouldn't recommend deleting apache and PHP.\n\nA: I'd say unified GUI integration.\n\nWith MAMP, you've got a single window to manage Apache, PHP, and MySQL. Whereas with the built-in stack, you have to active PHP manually and have another interface for MySQL (with no easy way to turn it on or off)\n\n", "Q: How do I access my google chrome sync'd bookmarks on my iPhone while I'm out n about? I once used Foxmarks, then delicious and now google chrome bookmarks.\nI think each one has sucked in different ways, but i'm at a stage where i'm using google for hosting all my core info, it makes to put bookmarks with them too.\nDelicious just never innovated in chrome, and stayed a FF thing.\nI like google chrome bookmarks cos they're with my google account and they sync nicely and quickly. Organization is nice too. Oh, and free\nBut how do I access it from afar?\n\nA: Ever use X-marks? I use it for firefox and it's free and easy. Whenever you close firefox it syncs. If you need to access it from a different browser, you just go to xmarks.com and put in a name and password, and it takes you to your bookmarks as clickable links.\n", "Q: Which iPhone English dictionary gives the best pronunciation?

I write my emails in two languages. So system-wide spelling language setting is not very useful for me, since in span of working day I usually write half of my emails in one language and half in another. Now the current spelling language switching mechanism is not very good. First of all I need to invoke spelling window with CMD + : then change the language, then close the window, refocus my mail window and then continue writing. Also the spelling with the new language is applied only to the text I am entering after changing the language. Previous text is not spelled, unless I click each word individually. \nSo I have the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does there exist a quick method to change the language? Keyboard shortcut? List of the languages appearing after right click the way it is organised in Google Chrome?  Maybe there is a possibility to associate spelling language to keyboard layout? I use different layout for different languages, so this would be very natural.\n\n*How to automatically apply spelling to the text which was entered before the change of the language?\nI use Mac OS X 10.6.6. \n\nA: I have just spent some time with Mountain Lion after I added a custom dictionary (Afrikaans) to the ~/Library/Spelling folder (.dic and .aff).\nFindings:\n- If I set the \"Spelling\" in \"System Preferences -> Language and text -> Text\" to Afrikaans, the Afrikaans spell check works great.\n- If I set the \"Spelling\" to \"Automatic by language\" detection between English and Afrikaans it does not work correctly. It never recognises Afrikaans, checks everything as English.\nSo in mail.app the only workable option seems to be to set it up to check email upon sending, and to select the language at the bottom of the pop-up box.\nAlternatively buy Postbox, where you can install a Thunderbird dictionary and select the language manually. But Postbox is not doing retina displays (yet) - it looks awful at the moment on retina.\n\nA: On Mac OS X Snow Leopard (and maybe Leopard), the spell checker is smart enough to detect which language you're using.\nWell, YMMV, personally I'm mostly writing in French and English, and I just have to type the 4 ou 5 first word, and Mac OS X automatically detect which language I'm using.\nIt seems to detect at least by paragraph, but it could also be by sentence, I haven't fully tested.\nSo try to set your spell checker language to \"Detect automatically\" and see if it's smart enough for your use.\n\nA: I have disabled the as-you-type spell checker, and set the Mail.app setting to check spelling first when I press 'Send'. The pop-up spell checker window enables me to select language. This way changing the spell checking language applies to the whole email.\nI suppose any way to check you spelling apart from the as-you-type spell checker gives you full control over the language.\n", "Q: MacBook white support 64-bit Need to ask a question about my MacBook White\nIt's Early 2009 model (http://support.apple.com/kb/SP504)\nMy question is, will it support:\n1. Snow Leopard with 64-bit\n2. Windows 7 with 64-bit\nThanks\n\nA: With Snow Leopard, you never really say if you want 64bit or not.\nWith Windows, yes, according to this Apple KB, your laptop supports 64bit Windows\n\nA: This model has a 64-bit CPU, and thus can run programs in 64-bit mode in both Leopard and Snow Leopard (note that MacOS doesn't have an overall 32/64-bit switch, it just runs each program in the best mode available).  It will not support booting Snow Leopard's kernel in 64-bit mode (see Apple's KB article #HT3770), but the kernel mode is not particularly important.\n", "Q: Internal Bluetooth Failed in Mac Pro I have a dual quad-core Mac Pro bought in July 2008 (2.8GHz Xeon processors, 16GB RAM). Not the latest model. But the internal Bluetooth never worked very well and finally quit completely (after the one-year warranty expired, of course). I didn't care too much because I didn't like the Bluetooth mouse I had and didn't mind using the USB Mighty Mouse that came with it.\nWell, the Mighty Mouse trackball died for good (no amount of cleaning has restored its ability to scroll down a page, though it scrolls up just fine)  and the only new mouse I could get from Apple was the Magic Mouse. So I bought a 3rd-party USB Bluetooth dongle, which works OK, but occasionally disconnects my mouse for a while and sometimes requires me to use the USB mouse to reconnect it via the Bluetooth menu. Also I experience periods of latency that are intensely frustrating, especially when gaming.\nI Googled extensively and found diagrams of the internal Bluetooth. I examined the Bluetooth chip on the motherboard and found a wire was loose. I reconnected the wire but I still can't get the internal Bluetooth to work at all. I located a solution that would require soldering, but the diagram showed didn't look exactly like my setup, so I gave it a pass (I balk at soldering my motherboard anyway). \nI hear there were problems with the Bluetooth on my model, but obviously they are not going to get fixed for free by Apple. So, on to my specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there anything I can do to get the native Bluetooth working short of paying to have Apple fix it?\n\n*If I did get the native Bluetooth working, would it be any better than the 3rd-party alternatives?\n\n*Is latency something you just have to live with when using a Bluetooth mouse?\n\n*Does anyone sell new or reconditioned (perfectly) USB Mighty Mouses? I haven't been able to find any online except used models.\n\n\nA: Your question contains a myriads of questions, but let me try to give you a hint on some.\n\n\n*\n\n*Possibly not, unless you can find a way to fix it, Apple will happily charge you fix it for you.\n\n*I don't know if it will be better, but I know that the BT on that machine works ok. And that's because I have the exact same model. Mac Pro early 2008 with Dual Quad-Core Xeons in it.\n\n*Yes and no. I've used the (included) Mighty mouse for a week. I hated it and simply gave it to a friend who liked it. There IS some latency in BT peripherals and there are some micro-disconnections that get fixed real fast, but if you're playing a FPS, you'll notice a small \"it's not working\" moment. Also, the less change the batteries have, the more this will happen. Same with the keyboard. You're typing and then ……… a couple of secs of nothing and then it works again. Sometimes you even get the \"Disconnected\" Bezel on screen.\n\n*I can't help you with that. I absolutely hate mighty mice. \nThe plural of mouse is mice ;-) \n", "Q: Check if a process is running, if not execute it again in Terminal Is there a way to periodically check if a process is running with (probably with Apple script, or some other shell script) and if not then to execute it in Terminal?\nI have a PHP script that is needs to run, but after some time it breaks, so I need to start it again.\nThanks.\n\nA: In OSX use launchd to to this. launchd will start a command at login or boot and if the process dies it will restart it.\nThe process is controlled by a .plist file formatted as defined in Apple docs the example in that manual page is for the case you ask for.\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\n   http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd >\n   <plist version=\"1.0\">\n   <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.example.exampled</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n             <string>exampled</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>KeepAlive</key>\n        <true/>\n   </dict>\n   </plist>\n\nIf you want to to start when a user logs in the this file goes in ~/Library/LaunchAgents. If when the machine boots then /Library/LaunchDaemons (which can't have access to the GUI)  but this will run as root unless you add a UserName key. (Thanks to @Gordon Davisson for the correction and a reread of Apple definitions)\nFor ease of setting the .plist up you can use Lingon.app available from the Mac AppStore\n\nA: If you wanted to do this via a shell script I'd do something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nPROCESS=`ps A | grep PROCESS_NAME | grep -v grep`\nif [ \"$?\" -ne \"0\" ]; then\n        echo \"not running\"\n        ### COMMAND TO EXECUTE HERE ###\n        exit 1\nfi\n\nYou could call that via cron every minute or so.\n\nA: Why you need to actively poll for the script? Why not just put it in a shell script loop and restart it when it fails. \n#!/bin/sh\n\nlet c=1\nwhile ! php -f myscript.php; do\n    echo \"The script has crashed $c times so far...\"\n    let \"c=c+1\"\ndone\n\nIn the case it doesn't fail gracefully, polling for a running process won't save you either. It may as well keep running while not doing its job.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run both Xcode 3 and 4 side-by-side on the same machine? As the title says, can I have both versions of Xcode installed on the same machine?\n\nA: Yes.\nFrom the doc 'About Xcode and iOS SDK.pdf':\n\nBy default, Xcode 4 installs in the folder /Developer - but if you wish to install it in a different folder, allowing it to co-exist with previous Xcode 3.2 installations, you can change this location. You do this by selecting \"Custom Install\" \n\nThe doc gives detailed instructions.\n\nA: To answer your question: Yes. When you install Xcode 4 (and its dev tools) your \"old\" Xcode folder gets renamed as Developer-old (provided you already had Xcode 3 installed)\nTo answer Ricket: Xcode 4 doesn't support a few things (yet) like Plugins and some features (like assembly code) are non existent in Xcode4 (perhaps yet or never) so if you rely on some things you might want to keep a copy of Xcode 3 around.\nIf you want to take a look at a good Xcode 4 review (and see some of the key benefits/drawbacks) have a look at this.\n\nA: Just installed Xcode 4 (iOS 5 beta) following Wayfaring Stranger's pointer to change the destination of Essentials (default is Developer folder, which would have probably uninstalled Xcode 3).\nHowever, note that installation vis-a-vis commandline tools was not so smooth. So far I noticed:\n\n\n*\n\n*xed disappeared from the PATH (and the new Xcode didn't get added, either). My scripts/aliases stopped working until I fixed the issue. You might want to make sure your PATH is set up right after the install.\n\n*xed from my custom install folder (4.0) can't find Xcode.app that it's supposed to launch.\n\n*XcodeBuild (and probably other commandline tools) was replaced with the new one in /usr/bin, so if you're building against an SDK that's not included in Xcode 4 (e.g., 4.2), you'll get build errors.\nAs far as the question of why one would want to install these side by side, there's another reason that hasn't been mentioned by others. If you have a team of even a few people and a ship date, you might not want to change your tooling until a later date. But, you might want to check out what's new. For example, I want to follow along with the WWDC sessions that discuss the new SDK/Xcode features.\n\nA: Just got XCode 3 and 4 working together.  First I installed XCode 4 and then decided I needed both.  After installing XCode 3 to /Developer/XCode3 , then XCode 4 broke.  I ran the XCode 4 installer again and now both work.\n", "Q: Is it possible for my HTC phone to interupt my music when I receive a call? I frequently miss incoming telephone calls because I am listening to my iPod Touch.\nDoes anyone know if it's possible for my iPod to detect incoming calls on my mobile phone (an HTC Desire) and alert me to the phone call?\nI've seen bluetooth connection devices that purport to do this (such as the GEAR4 BluEye), but they are several years old now.  \nHowever given that this kind of hardware exists, and that the iPod Touch has Bluetooth built-in, I wondered if there was an app or setting that would enable the phone and iPod to work together in this way?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure, you can't do that. You have a bluetooth connection between your iPod and your headset - your mobile phone cannot close this connection or notify you over your headset. So you may have to buy an iPhone or use the HTC to listen to music... :)\n", "Q: How to move around with the mouse in a Web Clip Widget? I have created a Clip Web dashboard with a selection of a web site that shows a google maps with special spots. How can I move the map around in that widget ? \nThe only thing I managed to do is to move the widget itself :-/\n\nA: As I recall, Web Clip Widgets are 100% non-input interactive. They will show automatic changes/animations (javascript/AJAX fired events, animated GIFs, etc.), but they do not allow you to interact with the web page. Generally speaking, that would defeat the purpose.\n", "Q: Using TextEdit for HTML Is there a way to open a HTML file in TextEdit without it rendering the file but just showing it as source (and possibly edit it)?\n\nA: It is in TextEdit help - search for HTML\n\nIf you open an HTML file and don’t see the HTML code, TextEdit is displaying the file in the same way a browser would. You can choose to display the file’s HTML code instead.\nTo display the code in an HTML file:\nChoose File > Open.\nSelect “Ignore rich text commands.”\nLocate the file and click Open.\nTo always view the code in HTML files,\n  choose TextEdit > Preferences, click\n  “Open and Save,” and then select\n  “Ignore rich text commands in HTML\n  files” below “When Opening a File.”\n\nSo it seems you have to choose before opening the file.\n\nA: Use the ⇧⌘T key combination to render the document you're viewing as plaintext instead of WYSIWYG.\n\nA: \nLooks like you can make that a permanent setting TextEdit -> Preferences... and then click the 'Open and Save' tab and you'll see a checkbox to check to turn on 'Ignore rich text commands in HTML files' when opening a new file. \n\n–from old comment by Ian C\n", "Q: What is the function of /home in Snow Leopard? I would like to mirror the directory structure that I have on my linux machine at work. There, my home directory resides in /home/emiller rather than /Users/emiller as it does on Snow Leopard.\nI was intending to create /home/emiller and use it as a sshfs mount point for my files on the linux machine - thus permitting to me run all my scripts without having to change any paths.\nHowever, when I try to mkdir /home/emiller, I get:\nmkdir: /home/emiller: Operation not supported\nWhy is this? What is the function of /home? It appears empty of all files. \n~emiller\n\nA: It's got an NFS automounter map mounted on it, so NFS home directories will be automatically available there.  Quoting man auto_master:\n\nThe auto_master file contains a list of the directories that are to be\n  automounted.  Associated with each directory is the name of a map that\n  lists the locations of the filesystems to be automounted there.

Alternately, add your sshfs mount to /etc/auto_home (and again restart automountd or reboot).\n", "Q: Which exact processor model do the macbook pros have? The new 15 and 17 inch macbook pros only list the processor model as quad-core core i7.\nHowever what is the fully model number of the processor?\nAre the quad core processors really dual cores with hyperthreading or are they really quad core? \nDo any of the models have hyperthreading?\nAs requested pasting info about the macbook pro model to enhance this page:\nModel Name:   MacBook Pro\nModel Identifier: MacBookPro8,2\nProcessor Name:   Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed:  2 GHz\nNumber of Processors: 1\nTotal Number of Cores:    4\nL2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\nL3 Cache: 6 MB\nMemory:   4 GB\nBoot ROM Version: MBP81.0047.B04\n\nA: The processor used in the early 2011 15\" and 17\" i7 models is the 2.2 GHz quad-core (2720QM) Intel Core i7 Sandy Bridge with 6 MB on-chip L3 cache, so they have 4 cores and 8 threads.\nApple's MacBook Pro performance page makes it clear that Hyper-Threading is now standard on all MacBook Pro laptops.\n\nA: I do not know the model number, but they are actually quad core with hyperthreading, giving 8 logical cores.\n\nA: Although Apple very rarely prints exact CPU model numbers, a good reference site is EveryMac - it contains a database of all Macs, including exact CPU model numbers.\n", "Q: Transferring Skitch history to new Mac I bought a new MacBook and am wanting to transfer my Skitch history.

Thanks!!\n\nA: Most of these didn't work for me.\nThis did: https://github.com/sbarex/SourceCodeSyntaxHighlight\nReally excellent, worked immediately, lots of options.\n\nA: I use Ciarán Walsh’s TextMate in QuickLook plugin.\n\nThis is a TextMate plug-in and a QuickLook generator which renders QuickLook previews (for certain filetypes) using the TextMate syntax highlighter. Currently it’s configured to highlight Perl, PHP, Ruby, Shell, C headers and Obj-C(++). Note: this effectively sets up TextMate as a server for the syntax highlighting, so it won’t work unless TM is running (QuickLook will just fall back to the standard preview if it’s not).\n\nHere is a convenience link to download the plugin and you can read more about it on Ciarán's web page.\nThis is what it looks like when I QuickLook a .yml file:\n\n\nA: I've had great luck with the free QLStephen plugin for Quick Look. It displays lots of other plaintext formats.\nTo preview YAML files with this plugin these additional steps need to be followed after plugin installation.\nYou can get it here.\n\nA: You can use the QLStephen plugin as mentioned but you will need to edit it as described in the project's issue tracker: https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen/issues/23#issuecomment-21769063\nBasically:\n\n*\n\n*Open the ~/Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist file in a text editor\n\n*Add the UTI public.yaml to the key LSItemContentTypes\n\n*Run qlmanage -r to reload the service\n\n", "Q: Is there an iPad PDF Reader app that has autoscroll? I read stacks of PDFs on my iPad and I have downloaded (and paid for) a few PDF readers hoping to find an auto-scroll feature, without luck.\nDoes anyone know of any iPad app that can auto-scroll PDF's (preferably with Dropbox integration so I can get at my PDFs easily!).\nThanks\n\nA: To date, I have found only one PDF reader that has Dropbox connectivity and has autoscroll(after a fashion.)\nIt is PDF Reader Pro iTunes Link. It is a universal app that works on both iPad and iPhone and ties to Box.net, Dropbox, Googledocs, and iDisk.  It has an \"Autoflow\" feature that allows timed jumps (from 5 to 100 seconds) of a preset number of pixels (20 to 400.)  I bought it at the low price of $0.99 and it performs, pretty much, as expected.  It has some basic annotation capabilities and \"scans\" documents using the camera in the iPad 2.  I have an original so I couldn't test that feature.\nI haven't used it a lot as I like the annotative capabilities of iAnnotate, but the app is a good fall back if I need the autoflow feature.\nFor $0.99 it looks to be a solid reader that fits the requirements you laid out.\n\nA: I think GoodReader (iTunes Link) is right up your alley.\nIt supports PDFs primarily, but according to it's site also supports Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, HTML WebArchive, images/audio/video files.\nIt can connect to Dropbox shares, download resources directly off the web (and some other protocols, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV) in-app, supports Document Sharing (file loading via iTunes), features autoscroll, and many many more features and customizations that you didn't ask about!\nIt is unfortunately NOT a Universal app, USD$5 for the iPad version. And another USD$5 should you ever want to buy it for an iPhone/iPod.\n\nA: If good reader has PDF autoscroll I haven't found it.\nWhat it CAN do is extract text from a PDF, display it\nas if it were plain text, and autoscroll that.\n\nA: Try Filemagnet!  You can control autoscroll with the tilt of your device.\n", "Q: How can I repeat a video at slow playback speed? Is there any way to repeat a video while it's playing in slow motion?\nI tried using both QuickTime and VLC. I don't see a way to control the playback speed in QuickTime, and the problem with VLC is that when the video replays, it loses the playback speed setting. \n\nA: You can do this with QuickTime 7. Grab a copy off the Mac OS X Install DVD.\nGo Window-> AV Controls and change the playback speed. (Or something with a similar name)\nThen View-> Loop for repeating.\n\nA: Option-clicking the forward button increases playback speed by 0.1. Clicking the backward button plays videos in reverse though. You can set the rate between 0 and 1 by running this in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to set rate of document 1 to 0.8\n\nIn Movist you can press ⇧⌘← or adjust the slider in the control HUD.\n", "Q: How to increase keyboard key repeat rate on OS X? I know how to set the key repeat rate using System Preferences > Keyboard but it looks that the fastest settings is not enough.\nIs there any way to speed up even more?\nI do not know if others encountered the same issue, but I'm using a MacBook Pro, model 2010.\n\nA: You can also change the preference keys by running the following in Terminal:\ndefaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10 # normal minimum is 15 (225 ms)\ndefaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 # normal minimum is 2 (30 ms)\n\nThe changes aren't applied until you log out and back in. KeyRepeat can't be set between 2 (30 ms) and 1 (15 ms) though.\nI also use KeyRemap4MacBook. I've set the repeat rates to 40 ms and the initial repeat rates to 150 ms.\n\nA: I just discovered that I had KeyRemap4MacBook installed and inside this application you have lots of low level settings for key repeat.\nNow I'm happy with 400ms initial repeat time and 20ms repeat wait.\n\nA: Old post, but this may help someone: If you are using the \"Karabiner app\" (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) which is a third party app commonly used to remap keys (or make OS X keyboard mimic some of Windows keyboards behaviors) it will bypass your OS X configurations.\nIf you are using it, to increase your keyboard rate you should go to the app and on the second tab (\"Key Repeat\") you'll find the option Repeat Rate. Changing that will render immediate effect and, as far as I can tell, it's the only way to get the repeat rate changed when using this app.\n\nA: @user495470's answer is great for native apps, but for whatever reason, it appears to have messed up key repeat for me in XQuartz windows.  To work around the issue, I initially ran this in the terminal:\nxset r rate <initial wait> <number of repeated strokes per second>\n\nLeaving off the last 2 arguments will reset the system defaults.\nI read that you have to run this command every time you run XQuartz anew, but when I put it in my login script, it caused the system to hang on shutdown (until I killed the hung xset commands) and on startup, so I discovered that a better way to change the key repeat setting is to first disable the little bubble menu that appears above a typed character upon press & hold, e.g. hold down the a key and you are presented with a bubble containing alternate 'a' characters with various umlauts, accents, etc..:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nThen run the key repeat commands:\ndefaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10 # normal minimum is 15 (225 ms)\ndefaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 # normal minimum is 2 (30 ms)\n\nIf you do it this way, key repeats will work in XQuartz windows without needing to run xset r # #.\n", "Q: Remapping keys to match Windows I'm completely new to the Mac and I have a whole lot of problems with the shortcuts etc.\nIs it possible to remap the keys to match my windows expirience? For example I'd like to have CTRL+C, CTRL+V as Copy & Paste.\n\nA: The best solution I found was the free KeyRemap4MacBook utility -- it lets you change the keyboard in many ways. My personal modifications (for the MacBook Air 2012 model):\n\n\n*\n\n*\"fn + cursor left/right\" for Home/End and \"fn + up/down\" for PgUp/PgDown, via For PC Users: Use PC Style Home/End, Use PC Style PageUp/PageDown\n\n*switching the function keys to work like on \"PC\" notebooks, i.e. F1-F12 without modifier and \"fn + Fx\" for the screen brightness etc changes, via Functional Keys to F1..F12 plus Fn+F1..F12 to Functional Keys.\n\n\nA: What I recommend for you is remapping the keys so that pressing the Control button on your keyboard tells you computer that you're pressing command. That way, you can use the button you're used to automatically without having to set up each shortcut you want. Here's how:\nGo to System Preferences (in your Applications folder) and click Keyboard. Go to the Keyboard tab and click the Modifier Keys... button.\nSelect your keyboard from the Select keyboard... menu.\nTo give yourself a Windows-like experience, do the following:\nIn the first menu, Leave Caps Lock alone.\nSet the second menu to Command so that the line reads like this: Control (^) Key: ⌘ Command\nChange the third menu to Option.\nChange the fourth menu to Control.\nWith this setup, pressing the Control button will make the computer think you've pressed Command.

I install some app from WD external Hard and it add some incon in my menu bar but I don't know how can I remove it, I try to drag it out of the system bar while holding the \"command\" key (but it didn't work for this type of icon) I also try to uninstall this app via CleanApp but I can't find it!\nsorry because of my low reputation I can't post the image here. :(\n\nA: The best way to get an app to stop appearing in the menu bar is to make it stop opening automatically when you log in. Here's how:\nI believe that this app is just a login item. Here's how to remove it from your Login Items list.\nOpen System Preferences (/Applications). Go to Users & Groups -> your account -> Login Items. Click the lock at the bottom left and enter your password. Find the Quick View app in the list, select it, and click the minus sign below the list.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: For this particular app, WD provide an uninstaller. It should be in your Applications folder (look for \"WD Quick View Uninstaller.app\").\nYou will need to reboot before it is fully removed but it is disabled as soon as you run the installer (I was monitoring its network activity before and after).\nIt appears to be totally fine to remove it since it only provides information to the user rather than affecting any actual functionality of the drive. If your model of WD drive comes with a management console then all the information is apparently in there (this would be accessed via a browser. For a My Book Live it would be http://mybooklive.local/UI/ ).\n\nA: Apps that want to start at system launch have a couple of ways of doing this. Sometimes, it can be administered from the Login Items screen. But not always.\nFirst check if the app has preference settings of its own. For example, the Brother Control Center has a launch at boot option.\nIf the WD app doesn't have that option, then you can check for a few places in the /Library -- StartupItems and LaunchAgents (and potentially LaunchDaemons). You'll need to provide an admin's password to delete files from those places. Of course, you should be aware of what you're deleting since things are typically put in those places for a reason.\n\nA: All you need to do is open Activity Monitor and quit the WD QuickView process. Then go to Library/Application Support/WD SmartWare, where you will find WDQuickView.app. Move it to trash and delete it. It's as simple as that.\n", "Q: iPad 2 3G plan cost (att & Verizon) Is there any website comparing 3G plan for both carriers? Like application fee, monthly fee (including different data usage limit), termination fee.\n\nA: Macworld has a chart with a lot of that info here http://www.macworld.com/article/158361/2011/03/compare_ipad_data_plans.html\nThey also note (for your pre/post paid question):\n\nThat means that you can sign up for a month, cancel the plan afterwards, and then sign up for a separate month at some point in the future. However, while AT&T now offers both prepaid and postpaid options for data plans, Verizon only allows you to pay for data upfront. \n\nAs far as termination fee, neither are charging activation it looks like either (in the US). So you don't have to terminate it like a normal phone/data plan, you just pay for it the months you use it.\n", "Q: mac mail sort by date newest at top by default When opening mac mail I always get my mails sorted in the wrong order in the Date sent column i.e. oldest at the top. But like most people I want to have my mails sorted by the newest date on top by default.\nIs it possible to configure mac mail to sort my mails by newest date at the top by default?\n\nA: If you change the sort by clicking on the table headers it should stay that way across launches.\n\nA: With the Date Sent column header is selected (blue), the default should be to sort with the newest at the top. If this isn't the case, click the column header again and the order will switch.\nSo, if it was oldest first before, it will now be newest first and vice-versa.\n", "Q: How to enter special characters so that Bash/Terminal understands them? Let's say a folder has a file called Näyttökuva.png (for those who are interested, it is ”screenshot” in Finnish). This is what happens:\n$ ls\nNäyttökuva.png\n\n$ ls N*\nNäyttökuva.png\n\n$ ls Nä*\nls: Nä*: No such file or directory\n\nThis also affects the tab-auto-completion. If I start typing ls N and press tab it is correctly expanded to ls Näyttökuva.png. But if I start typing ls Nä tabbing does nothing.\nHow can I either:\n\n\n*\n\n*configure bash/terminal so it understands special characters\n\n*type the special characters so bash/terminal understands them?\n\n\nIn Terminal's encoding is set to UTF-8 in the Settings–tab and the Encoding–tab is in its default state, ie. UTF-8, Mac OS Roman, ISO Latin 1, ISO Latin 9, Windows Latin 1, ASCII, NextStep + some Asian codings are enabled.\n\nEven stranger (though probably not essential for the question):\nIf I type ls N, press tab, delete characters from the end until it reads ls Nä and press tab again, the command expands to ls Nättökuva.png [sic].\nIf I try deleting the letters second time back to ls Nä and press tab it expands to ls Nätökuva.png. Third run expands to ls Näökuva.png.\nFor some reason, the 4th run gives ls Nä̈kuva.png (notice the umlauts over umlauts). Tabbing the ls Nä̈ gives ls Nä̈kuva.png every time. Nevertheless, it works:\n$ ls Nä̈kuva.png\nNäyttökuva.png\n\n$ history 2\n518  ls Näyttökuva.png \n519  history 2\n\n\nA: This is an old question, and no definite answer. Just workarounds.\nHowever I combined some information from this old guide, and as suggested and instructed here:\nI installed a newer bash in my Snow Leopard. After installing it, bash completion works correctly! (Snow Leopard shipped with 3.2.48(1) and MacPorts installed 4.2.45_1). Remember to make the changes in /etc/shells and running chsh.\nAlso, because of some other instructions, I have in .inputrc:\nset meta-flag on\nset input-meta on\nset output-meta on\nset convert-meta off\n\nNot sure if they are required or not for proper operation.\n\nA: I think bash is tripping over some anomalies in how accented characters are handled.  You might want to grab some popcorn, because this is going to get technical for a little bit...\nUnicode allows some accented characters to be represented in several different ways: \"precomposed\" as a single \"code point\" representing the accented character, or \"decomposed\" as a series of code points representing the unaccented version of the character, followed by the accent(s).  For example, \"ä\" could be represented either as U+00E4 (UTF-8 0xc3a4, Latin small letter a with diaeresis) or as U+0061 U+0308 (UTF-8 0x61cc88, Latin small letter a + combining diaeresis).\nOS X's HFS+ filesystem requires that all filenames be stored in the UTF-8 representation of their fully decomposed form.  In an HFS+ filename, \"ä\" MUST be encoded as 0x61cc88, and \"ö\" MUST be encoded as 0x6fcc88.\nI'm pretty sure what's happening here is that when you type \"Näyttökuva.png\" at the command line, it's \"typing\" the characters in precomposed form.  When the file is created, the filesystem decomposes the characters for storage.  Everything is fine so far.  But when you try to use tab-completion starting with \"Nä\", I think bash is  failing to decompose the \"ä\" before searching for matches, and of course it doesn't find any.\nTo illustrate the difference, here's an example of what encoding is used when I just type \"Näyttökuva.png\" at the command line, vs. what's used when I store it as a filename and use tab completion to fill it in:\n$ printf Näyttökuva.png | xxd    # This time I pasted the it in from this web page\n0000000: 4ec3 a479 7474 c3b6 6b75 7661 2e70 6e67  N..ytt..kuva.png\n$ touch Näyttökuva.png           # Also pasted from the web\n$ printf Näyttökuva.png | xxd    # This time I tab-completed it after N\n0000000: 4e61 cc88 7974 746f cc88 6b75 7661 2e70  Na..ytto..kuva.p\n0000010: 6e67                                     ng\n\nNow, as for the matter of characters getting lost when deleting and re-tab-completing, I suspect that's closely related.  Specifically, I think bash is \"deleting\" one code point per press of the delete key, but erasing one character from the Terminal window per press.  Because one of the deleted characters (\"ö\" this time) consisted of two code points, but only one character, the Terminal display gets out of sync.  Try tab-completing the whole filename, deleting it back to \"Näytt\", then re-tab-completing: bash seems to think that only the combining diaeresis was deleted, not the entire \"ö\", so it re-adds the combining diaeresis, but it this time it attaches to the \"t\":\n$ echo Näytẗkuva.png \nNäyttökuva.png\n\nNote that when I press return, bash actually has the entire filename there; it's just the Terminal display that was confused.\nTL;DR bash has some bugs handling decomposable accented characters.\nEDIT: after some mulling, I think the only full solution is to fix bash (/wait for its developers to fix it).  There might also be a way to input characters in decomposed form, but I have no idea what that would be.  But I did find some partial workarounds:\n\n*\n\n*Drag-and-droping a file from the Finder pastes in its correct form.  Since the Finder gets the filename from the filesystem, it's already decomposed, so it just works.\n\n\n*You can actually tab-complete the accented character itself.  For example, if you type \"Na\" and then tab, it'll match \"Näyttökuva.png\" because the canonical decomposition of \"ä\" starts with \"a\".  But if you have a file named \"Narwal.gif\" in the same directory, that won't be very helpful...\n\n\n*I haven't tested this, but if you bind tab to menu-complete instead of complete, it should let you tab through possible matches so you can select the one you want even if you can't type the next letter.  (Or you could bind it to a different keystroke, so you can use it only when you need to.)\n\n\n*For fixing the problem with the Terminal display getting out of sync, you could bind something to redraw-current-line -- it won't prevent the problem from happening, but it'll give you a way to resynchronize the display.\n\nA: iconv is the solution, that worked for me:\nls `echo 'Näytẗkuva.png' | iconv -t UTF8-MAC`\n\nsee https://stackoverflow.com/a/23226449/1909531\n", "Q: Which graphics chip on MacBook Pro?

It will show all Device Connections at Startup of the Device and you can check if the Device is sending a Signal to you Mac.\nI had a similar case with an external Drive once and with the help of Hardware-Growler noticed that the external Drive was continously sending connecting and disconnecting Signals to my Mac and was not showing up in the Finder. I could isolate my Problem to a faulty AC-Adapter, but i doubt that's the case here. \nAre you connecting the LaCie directly to you Mac or is there a USB-Hub in between? \n\nA: Try using Disk Utility to repair disk permissions on your computer, while the external drive is plugged in.\nThen try resetting your PRAM.\nThen try connecting to the drive using something other than USB (eg, firewire).\n", "Q: Mount & unmount volume notifications For the last month or so, I have been receiving notification windows in the upper right-hand corner whenever a volume is mounted or unmounted (i.e. portable hard drive, Time Machine, etc.) How do I turn these notifications off?\n\nA: If Growl is installed and you want to turn off just the notifications for volume mounts and dismounts (as opposed to getting rid of Growl altogether):\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences, Growl panel\n\n*Applications tab\n\n*Select HardwareGrowler from the list\n\n*Configure\n\n*Notifications tab\n\n*In the dropdown, for each notification (e.g. Volume Mounted) you want to disable:\n\n*Select it and untick the 'Enabled' box.\n\n\n(Edit:) Or, as fnurl points out, remove HG entirely.\nI find it useful enough to keep, but tweaked to my liking.  It alerts me if my WiFi starts bouncing, f/ex.  YMMV, as always.\n\nA: Check to see if you have Growl installed - it will be in System Preferences. Sometimes applications install it without your permission - even though the growl team explicitly don't allow it. Its safe though, I use and love the product.  \n\nA: I use HardwareGrowler to get these messages.\nPerhaps HardwareGrowler is launching at startup? If you do not want this, go to\nSystem Preferences → Accounts → Your Account → Login items\nand find HardwareGrowler and remove it from the list.\n", "Q: What is your view using mac pro 8 core 8 GB system for software development? I have never used Mac system before but I am considering switching to Mac Pro 8 core 8 GB model. Currently I am using Linux box based on Dell Core 2 Duo with 4GB ram (that is maximum it can have). I am running into performance issues and sluggish application startup especially Natilus file maanger. Usually I have multiple applications running at same time.\nI also need to run windows virtual machines for software testing.\nIf I invest in Mac Pro system:\nWould I get much better performance?\nWould I be able to run Windows as virtual machine within Mac Osx?\nWould the learning curve be easier in terms of radically different UI on Mac Osx?\nWhat about SSD disk on mac pro? Does it make very visible difference in performance when running applications?\nOne huge benefit I will get is to be able test web applications under mac osx/safari and as well as be able to develop for iphone and ipad.\n\nA: You will definitely get a performance boost by upgrading from the Linux box to the Mac Pro. However, I don't believe that you'll see a huge difference in terms of actual performance between that Mac Pro and, say, an iMac with a 3.6Ghz i5 and 6 or 8 GB RAM.\nAs long as you're not doing a lot of gaming or other graphics-intensive or math-intensive things, the iMac should seem to the user almost as fast as the Mac Pro.\nThere's no harm getting the Pro, but I think you may as well save yourself the money...\nAs for running a VM, that's easy. You can even, with Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion, run Windows apps and Mac apps side-by side.\nOther software to look into is Boot Camp (free, supplied by Apple, restart required to switch systems) and Sun/Oracle VirtualBox (free, no restart required, some features missing).\nAs for the learning curve: It's not too bad. Lots of people make the transition. IIRC, 50% of Mac purchases are first-time Mac users. Apple offers a Switching 101 guide to help you out. Also, if you're used to Linux, you'll catch on quickly. Besides, most of the CL stuff is the same, so you'll always be at home there.\nAs for SSDs: They're really, really fast. You can see various tests and comparisons run by manufacturer OWC here. For best shock value, watch their video where they race an SSD machine with an HDD one to boot and open apps from CS5. It's pretty amazing...\nA cordial welcome to the world of Mac!\n\nA: Honestly, if you're good with Linux and Windows, adding in OS X won't be a problem and coming from Linux, you'll love terminal.\nFrom my experience, SSD's add a ton of performance and the current Mac Pro's would be more than powerful enough for development and future expandability.\nThere are a few different virtual machine programs you might want to look into (Parallels/VMWare/Virtual Box), but I haven't tried a bad one.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: One of the big reasons Mac Pros cost more is because they use graphics cards certified for certain professional graphics applications (Maya, Autocad, etc.). This in mind, do you need to pay that extra premium for something you won't use, or will an iMac suffice?\n", "Q: Can I feed spoofed video to sites like omegle.com that require a connected camera? Sites like omegle.com want video from my connected camera, but I don't \nhave one. How can I feed omegle.com (a Flash app) a spoofed video feed \n(eg, a static picture, mp4 file, etc?) \n\nA: iGlasses is one way to do this. It shows up as a camera on websites, and you can play a video or show an image by dragging it into the effects tab.\n\nA: Theres a free application called ManyCam, I've used it on Facebook and ChatRoulette to display a picture or movie file instead of my iSight.\n\nA: CamTwist creates \"pseudo-video\" devices for lots of different things, so you could display your desktop or any subset of it, or other content you choose. CamTwist's feature set is likely very similar to Ryan Sharp's suggestion for ManyCam.\n", "Q: iMovie video conversion I imported all of my videos from a Sony HDR-CX550V camcorder into iMovie '11.  I imported the video at the original resolution 1920x1080.  I was planning on converting the video into some other codec so I can view it on both a Mac and Windows machine.\nUnfortunately, I learned that this video is an ICOD (Apple Intermediate Codec) format wrapped in an MOV and I cannot use Handbrake to convert the video.\nSo I created a project in iMovie, added one of the videos to it, and exported it to HD 1080p...and the quality was absolutely horrible!  For instance, the shadows in the converted video had a red tint!  It reminded me of a .GIF animation.\nUnfortunately, I no longer have the videos on the camcorder, so I'm stuck with these ICOD files...what are my options?  I want to convert them into something Handbrake can handle.\nThanks!\n\nA: From iMovie, go to Share-> Export Using QuickTime. Set the Export: menu is set to Movie to MPEG-4. Click the Options... button next to that menu.\nSet the File Format to MP4\nSet the Video Format to H.264\nSet the Data Rate to something like 2048\nSet the Image Size to 1080\nClick OK\nClick Save\nThat should give you a much better-quality video.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How iPad screen gameplay is captured? In some video such as\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csjXiu9HLrA\nI see that it looks like the iPad video is captured... but it is also said that the Component cable for iPad only works for movies and photos, but not for apps...  so how can it be done?\n\nA: It's likely the video was captured using the iOS development emulator rather than the actual iPad itself.\n\nA: As in my comment, the Simulator probably is not it...  I have heard using the VGA adaptor and using a VGA to computer file recorder box that can hook up VGA output to a computer's USB port and record the VGA signal... maybe that's it...  I wonder if this is how the \"white dot\" is recorded.\n", "Q: Identify and tag music from iTunes library under OS X I'm looking for a tool, preferably free, that would help me identify and correctly tag my itunes music collection.\n\nA: You have many choices, you can download one of these software and correct all of your ID3 Tags:\n\n\n*\n\n*TuneUP\n\n*Musicbrainz\n\n*Jaikoz\n", "Q: How do I remove duplicate \"Open With\" context menu items in Finder.app? For whatever reason, the \"Open With\" context menu in Finder is always listing every app four times (exactly).\n\nI've also used Onyx.app to clear user and system caches, but I'm still left with four repetitions of each app under the \"Open With\" service. I have restarted the system a few times just to be sure it was not some temporary corruption of the list.\nI'm running OS X 10.6.6 on a 2011 17\" MacBook Pro with a recent fresh install of OS X (i.e. I didn't use Migration Assistant.app or a Time Machine backup).\n\n*\n\n*no external or network drives mounted (including any time machine destinations)\n\n*Same list of duplicate apps if I create a new user account\n\nHow can I fix this so one app shows?\n\nA: After running lsregister (as mentioned in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/10615/24322), relaunch the finder. (To do this, do an Option + Right Mouse Click on the Finder icon in the dock, then  select \"relaunch\".)\n\nA: For a quicker and easy-to-remember way, you can alias the command shown in the top answer into lscleanup like so:\n# Clean up LaunchServices to remove duplicates in the “Open With” menu.\nalias lscleanup=\"/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user && killall Finder\"`\n\nAdd that to your .aliases file (or any other file that runs when you open Terminal) and you won't have to remember that convoluted command ever again.\n\nA: You can’t always run this with sudo.\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nThat alone didn't fix things for me. It wasn't until I ran the above command plainly (using  my user account privileges and not root/sudo permissions) that the problem was solved on my Mac.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/\\\nLaunchServices.framework/Support/\\\nlsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\nkillall Finder\n\nThis is the bare minimum -- no extra commands, mouse clicking, aliases, or third-party applications. I borrowed it from the other answers, but I made it readable in less than 80 columns!\n\nA: Since this problem happens at System Level, I'm not sure if these steps will do any difference.\nI assume that, like you've said, you've rebuilt your LaunchDatabase. Just in case: \n\nYou can try the Command Line version of the above (In a terminal):\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nAdditionally, Default Apps is a nice and free System Preference pane to control default apps (based upon extension, type, etc.) You can pretty much see and associate everything from there. It should at least give you a hint whether the problem is in the association or the finder is doing something funky. \nWhen did this start happening? Did you install something? I see you have Xcode 4, did you get it from the App Store or you have a Developer Profile and got it via direct download? Was this happening before? Does this happen with every type of file or only some specific ones?\n", "Q: Kanex Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter doesn't play audio on Sony Bravia TV I have MacBook Pro with a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter. I use the adapter to play images from the Mac to my Sony Bravia TV.\nSince it doesn't play sound, I have an audio that connects the Mac to the PC in HDMI Audio jack. \nEven though, the sound still doesn't play on the TV (and when the cable is connected to the Mac, the sound also doesn't play on the Mac, which indicates the sound is going somewhere else, but not the TV!).\nI've tried some configurations on the Applications / Utilities / Audio Midi Setup, but nothing works!\nWhat should I do? Any idea on how to make the audio cable work?\n\nA: Some thoughts, and things for you to check on:\n\n\n*\n\n*What model of MacBook Pro do you have? Older ones (pre-Mid 2010) don't have audio out through the Mini DisplayPort.\n\n*Have you tried looking at System Preferences » Sound  » Output? What devices are displayed, and what have you chosen?\n\n*Can you explain what \"I have an audio that connects the Mac to the PC in HDMI Audio jack\" means?\n\n*Which Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter do you have? The early models were made to work with the then-current MacBooks (and Pros)—and as those models didn't have audio out over Mini DisplayPort, there wasn't any reason for the cable to, either.\n\n*Have you tried hooking up a cable from the Mac's audio out/speaker jack directly into the TV?\n\n*Some possibly-helpful info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I output video to my TV using a MacBook Pro? (Apple.SE)\n\n*About Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapters (Apple.com)\n\n*Apple Mini DisplayPort adapters: Frequently asked questions (Apple.com)\n\n\n\nA: I came up with a workaround for this today. You can use an headphone-->rca cable. You can plug it in, or possibly the newer technology audio hdmi adaptor that combines the two into the headphone jack, and then into rca.\nThe trick is you then need to tell the TV that while you are using the HDMI for video, you need it to use a different input for audio. (in my case video 2). In the case of my Panasonic TV Menu-->Audio-->Advanced Audio, and then arrow down to the hdmi video input you're using and then arrow to the side to make a different selection.\n\nA: Had the same problem with 2 different adapters. Finally I went to System Preferences » Sound » Output and selected HDMI (I had options of Internal Speaker and LG TV(HDMI)).\n", "Q: Does the iPad 2 have a TV Out?

I VPN into my work Windows PC (Win7) and used to use MS RDC to access it, but a little while ago a network move at work led to RDC no longer working.\nThe RDP connection via CoRD still works fine. On attempting to connect with Microsoft RDC 2.1 or 2.0.1, I get 2 error dialogs now. The first complains \"The certificate is not from a trusted certification authority\", whilst the second says that \"The remote computer is not allowing connections from the Mac\". Eeven though I have set the remote computer in question up to allow RDP, as evidenced by my ability to access it via CoRD. \nI can still access other PCs on the same work network using RDC, just not the one I want to use. I'd prefer to use RDC over CoRD simply because it is faster on my 10.6.8 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I had something similar happen to me once. What I did was to go into the Preferences for RDC, and in the Login tab, remove the value for the Domain parameter. That did the trick for me.\n\nA: Actually, in my case, RDC password was stored in the keychain on Mac. I deleted the keychain entries, closed out RDC completely (Apple --> Quit) and restarted it. This time it prompted me for a password (and saved it correctly in keychain once again) and logged me in.\n\"Automatically reconnect\" is a feature which you do not want to disable generally.\n\nA: Had the same problem too. In Preferences, Login, I had checkbox \"Automatically reconnect\" ticked, and it tried to connect with wrong credentials.\nEither remove tick, or make sure you have the right username and password.\n", "Q: Do any RSS apps available for OS X and/or iOS sync via anything other than Google Reader? I recently switched from NetNewsWire to Reeder on my iPhone and iPad because a) Reeder as a “Mark as unread” button, and b) I thought NetNewsWire was marking older articles as read, and not letting me switch them back.\nI soon realised that old articles were being actually marked as read because Google Reader does that after a month.\nWhilst I prefer Reeder’s UI, I think it’s (currently) purely a Google Reader front-end. Are there any RSS apps that sync via some service, free or paid, other than Google Reader, and thus let me keep articles as unread for more than a month?\nNetNewsWire used to sync via NewsGator, but I believe NewsGator no longer offer an RSS sync service. \n\nA: My last comment just gave me one idea that might solve your issue: Google's Feedburner. You can configure it to send emails from any feed. It will be little troublesome at first as it's a long manual job. Seems like it is unsupported and not really meant to be used like this. But it works perfectly!\nHere are some quotes from its own help:\n\nWhat triggers the email to be sent out?\nFeedBurner sends subscribers a daily\n  digest of new content from your blog,\n  so a new post, new title, link, or\n  change to the published date will\n  trigger the email delivery. If you do\n  not post anything that day, no email\n  is sent out.\nFeedBurner only keeps a change history\n  for items currently listed in the\n  feed. Once they “drop off the bottom”\n  of the feed, the system forgets about\n  them completely. If you re-introduced\n  them later by increasing the number of\n  items your feed contains, this will\n  result in the newly included items\n  being delivered via email as “new”\n  content.\nHow much does this service cost and what methods of payment are accepted?\nFeedBurner Email is a free service.\n  However, we do accept voluntary\n  payment in the form of props and\n  general goodwill.\nHow do you get started?\nSign in to your FeedBurner account,\n  select your feed, navigate to the\n  Publicize tab and select \"Email\n  Subscriptions.\"\n\n\nA: Given the absence of answers (aside from Cawas’ sterling efforts), I’m going to call this one a “no” for now. The situation might just change once iOS 5 and iCloud go live.\n", "Q: Looking for the ultimate IDE for Mac I am a little disenchanted with development on the Mac right now. I need a single IDE that can handle all of my development needs. I did notice there are other questions on this topic already, but those did not cover my specific needs of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Must support at least HTML, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and PHP syntax highlighting, bonus if there are more language plug-ins available\n\n*Must support the ability to connect to FTP and SFTP\n\n*Must support handling of projects/sites\n\n*Must have some level of code completion, even if it is just at the variable level\n\n*Must support syntax formatting\n\n*Must be able to recognize and highlight ERB/TPL files as HTML\n\n\nAre there any suggestions for such an IDE out there?\n\nA: Sublime Text 2\nI couldn't have said it better:\n\nSublime Text has grown to become my favorite GUI code editor. It feels like a spiritual successor to TextMate (even allowing support for some TextMate bundles like snippets and themes), and has many original+natural features like fully independent text cursors, a very nice search feature, and a rapidly-growing plugin API and surrounding community.\n\n\nCheck it out, it's freaking awesome.\n(And it works on Windows and Linux too!)\n\nA: You can go for NetBeans, it's quite good and I prefer it.\n\nA: Oddly there is no mention of Eclipse yet. Its not just for Java, there are plugins for almost all the languages out there. I've used it on my MacBook Pro for years.\n\nA: JetBrains WebStorm is a commercial IDE for JavaScript, CSS & HTML built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA platform. WebStorm is a specialised version of PhpStorm, offering a subset of its features. WebStorm ships with pre-installed JavaScript plugins (such as for Node.js)\n\n\nA: I find the open source Atom the best!\nAtom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core—a tool you can customise to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.\n\nFull-featured, right out of the box\nCross-platform editing\nAtom works across operating systems. You can use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux.\nBuilt-in package manager\nSearch for and install new packages or start creating your own—all from within Atom.\nSmart autocompletion\nAtom helps you write code faster with a smart, flexible autocomplete.\nFile system browser\nEasily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.\nMultiple panes\nSplit your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.\nFind and replace\nFind, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects\nPackages for most of the requirements\nYou choose from thousands of open source packages that add new features and functionality to Atom—or build a package from scratch and publish it for everyone else to use\n\n*\n\n*Code completion -> autocomplete-plus\n\n\n*Run Code -> Script\nThemes\nCustomisable Themes\n\nA: I've been impressed with Aptana 3 - give it a try.  It has Smarty support.\n\nA: For web development in particular, there is Coda. I would also recommend Textmate from Macromates. \n\nA: I actually think the idea of a single, unified, development environment like what you're after is somewhat antithetical to OS X design principles. One of the great things I've found, since switching to OS X for development work about a year ago, is that many OS X application developers share my own personal philosophy when it comes to software: do less, but do it really, really well.\nAs such, my current development environment on OS X is less unified than it was on Windows or Linux, but far, far more stable, robust, and ultimately: productive.\nFor coding I use TextMate. It seems almost trivially simple at first and then you discover bundles and it's built-in command line filtering and it takes off. It will handle the highlighting tasks you requested. It has projects, and while they seem kind of loose at first, you'll grow to appreciate it. Trust me. And it does handle code completion, tag closing, tag matching -- the sort of stuff you'd expect -- it's just not obvious, but it's there in Bundles and waiting for you to customize it.\nUpdate: I've moved off TextMate and on to Sublime Text 2. The regular updates and the Python-based extensions were a major draw. It's been a year now and no regrets with that switch.\nI use Kaleidoscope for diffs. It's just an a beautiful diff tool. \nMy git tool is Tower and my Subversion tool is Versions. Both awesome.\nFor permanent, remote drive access via ssh I use MacFUSE to connect to the remote location and mount it as a drive on my Mac. This is a superior option to built-in ssh or ftp support in the IDE because all the programs on my Mac can now work with files on that share.\nI also use CyberDuck for it's awesome cost and excellent Amazon S3 support. I could even get away with just CyberDuck, no MacFUSE, if I had to. But I don't. :)\nUpdate: I've switched to ForkLift 2 as my primary means to interact with remote file systems. It's got a nicer UI than CyberDuck and a few less \"quirks\" to it. I'll still occasionally open up CyberDuck when I need to deliver a signed URL to an S3 object.\nFinally: iTerm 2. A terminal app befitting OS X. It really is quite a fantastic terminal. Bookmarks make it easy to get to my AWS machines quickly. The UI is clean. And tabs.\nAll of those things replace the clunky IDE (Komodo Pro) I use to use on Linux and Windows (and never really liked, just tolerated). And I don't even know that they're not all \"unified\" in one cluttered, modal window. No sir.\nFor reference, I write a lot Python, some HTML, JavaScript, Perl, and Java. And the occasional bit of C and C++.\nUpdate: There's more Go in my day to day coding now. My toolset integrated that relatively young language without so much as a hiccup.\n\nA: Another alternative is Komodo IDE: \"The Professional IDE for Python, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl and Web Dev\"\nYou can customize syntax highlighting if you want too. Have a look at the features.\n\nA: It's not an IDE, but the Vim editor does everything that you have asked for and much, much more!\n\nEven better, it comes pre-installed with Mac OS X. Also, once you have used it on OS X, you can use it on Windows, Linux, BSD, Amiga OS...\n\nA: I have tried SubLime , it is brilliant in looks . And one of the best thing about it is the fact that even if you force quit it , it will retain state of the app . So all of the tabs you were working on will get restored . \nIt's much needed when you accidently close the app . \nAbout TextMate , that's nice too . But Sublime is certainly +1 .\n\nA: Peppermint\n\n \nI don't know if this will strike as promotional, or not, but guys, I can't help not to talk about our own... brain child, Peppermint. \nWe've launched it around 1-2 weeks ago, and the response so far has been very welcoming - so I thought I should share it here as well.

The volume is very low. Even cranked all the way up, it is still not loud enough watching hulu, netflix etc.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Make sure you select the correct HDMI Output in System Preferences | Sound. You are probably still listening to the sound through the mac speakers.\nsheepish\n", "Q: Can the component AV cable and the HDMI cable mirror third party apps on TV? So I heard of the following:\n1) the component AV cable and the HDMI cable for iPad 1 cannot show the game play (3rd party apps) on TV.  Those 2 cables can only show movies and photos -- that's it.\n2) The HDMI cable for iPad 2 can do 100%, exact mirroring NO MATTER WHAT THE APP IS.  Whatever shows on iPad 2's screen, it will show.\nAre the above 2 facts true?  And what about Component AV cables for iPad 2, can it do 100% mirroring or is it limited to movies and photos?  thanks.\n\nA: Number 1 is exactly true, unless the developer chose to output the gameplay through the cable. A few games do this, but most do not.\nNumber 2 is exactly true.\nOn your last question, I'm not 100% certain and haven't tried it (I don't have the component cables). Video mirroring from the iPad 2 works with the VGA adapter, so it would likely work with the component cables, but I can't guarantee it.\nEdit: Looking at the specs on Apple's site under TV & Video, it seems pretty clear that component out work with the apps that do video out, but not for mirroring.\n\nA: To add a little bit more to Matthew's answer- the Apple Digital AV Adapter will work on the iPad 1 to output video and audio from apps like Videos, Youtube, Netflix, etc... but will not work for full mirroring. That is strictly an iPad2+Digital AV Adapter thing. The outputting of both the audio and video through the HDMI cable is pretty cool though, one less cable to jack in. \n", "Q: Is it bad that my MacBook Air is passing me electricity? Whenever my MacBook Air is connected to the AC power and I have my hands on the palm rest, I feel it passes some electricity to me. If I unplug it from the AC power it stops doing that.\nThis has recently became obvious, when other people can feel this tingling by touching my skin after I've been working for a while.\nI have two questions:\n1- Is this normal in unibody Macs?\n2- Is this harmful for my health in the long run?\n\nA: I had this with my MBP when I received it. It stopped when I changed the plug to use the one with the ground connection (don't know how it's called exactly). They provovide usually two plugs. A short one, with only two pins and longer one with three pins and connection to the ground. You should use this one.\n\nA: Electrical current passed from e.g. a MacBook Air can be avoided by plugging your Mac into a grounded power outlet. I sometimes get this too when using a non-grounded power outlet.\nI am assuming you are referring to being able to sense \"vibrations\" as you e.g. slowly and lightly move your fingers upwards on the palm rest?\nI have found that when I have my Macbook Pro plugged into a non-grounded outlet and I touch something that grounds me - e.g. a radiator, I can feel the vibrations. If I stop touching the radiator, the vibrations cease!\n\nA: had same issue. Bought mba 11 (mid 2011) model and felt this electrostatic flow while charging my mac. Changed it to long cable adapter with ground and problem solved. People that don't experience this kind of issue might have been in a place that already have their power outlet grounded. Also check your power extension if its faulty or try to charge on different power outlet.\n\nA: I had this happen a lot with the TiBooks of about a decade ago but haven't had it with any unibody machines, so I wouldn't say it was normal now, perhaps there's a minor fault with your machine, I can't tell you if it's bad for you or not but I'd recommend you take it back to a store and show them at least.\n\nA: Ok, I can feel it too with my MBP 7,1. It's not harmful for you and should not be in any way harmful for your computer. Ways to stop this:\n\n*\n\n*Try rotating the power adapter (plug it the other way, if this is possible with your power outlets - in some countries it's not).\n\n\n*Use a grounded cable and socket - The default US/EU adaptors plug does not have a ground, however if you use the extension cable with the charger, you will use the ground pin of the charger (ground pin is the metal ring, you can see when you remove the adapter, just above the serial number).\n\n\n\n*A very easy (and ugly) solution would be to ground the macbook itself - just tape a naked strand wire to the alu shell and the other end to a ground (by ground I mean ground).\n\nA: If you think your mac is giving you an electric shock while plugged into the mains then you need to unplug it from the mains and not plug it in again until you've been to an Apple store (or other reputable computer repair place) and had it tested. \nThis is absolutely not normal and potentially very unsafe. In fact consider that a default position for any consumer electronics you interact with. Electric shocks are not normal!\n", "Q: Are there apps that enable \"sticky\" / \"magnetic\" / \"docking\" windows? I am looking for an app that makes windows stick to each other (if anybody used WinAmp back in the day you know what I mean).\nThis would be great when using apps that have several windows that I want to treat as one window - so if there is another method to accomplish this please do tell!\nI found Zooom/2 that makes windows snap to each other when moving via Zooom/2's keyboard shortcuts, but the windows do not stick to one another when you move one of them.\n\nA: Divvy was my tool of choice for a while. It works like Zooom/2, so it will not fulfill your needs completely, just as the other suggestions on this question.\nStata 10 used to have 'magnetic' windows but the functionality disappeared, much to my sadness, in Stata 11. This change makes me believe that OS X must be resisting that functionality.\nI think that the whole Exposé logic is working against that kind of functionality in the minds of many (but not mine: I am very sympathetic to your problem, I hate messy screens too).\n", "Q: How to make DHCP domain name registration work with OS X? On Windows computer that are inside a domain the names are auto registered in the domain DNS when the DHCP assigns their IP addresses. \nThis is happening because the DHCP server is configured to dynamically update the DNS. \nThe problem is that this is not happening for OS X clients and I suspect that I need to configure something in the client to make it work.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: I believe you need to set the DHCP Client ID in System Preferences > Network > Ethernet > Advanced...\n", "Q: How should I encode my music for preserving the sound quality and be able to play it on iTunes and iOS? I have several CDs and other FLAC collections (classical music but not only). I want to add them to my iTunes library but I am looking for some recommendations regarding how I should encode them in order to keep the best sound quality and without running out of disk space.\nI found Max conversion tool for converting them but there are too many formats and configurations to choose from.\nAlso I do want to use a format that is able to use keep tags, like MP3.\nThe winning response should contain a numbered list of formats compatible with iTunes and iOS, ordered descending by the sound quality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Looseless\n\n*format X, (extension), bitrate, vbr\n\n*format Y, (extension), bitrate, ...\n\n*...\n\n\nPlease specify the format name clearly, preferably including the codec, like \"MPEG-4 AAC\", \"Apple Looseless\", \"MPEG-4 HE-ACC\", \"LAME MP3\", \"AAC ADTS\", \"MPEG-4 Audio versus Apple MPEG-4 Audio\",  \n\nA: You can use X Lossless Decoder(XLD) too:\n\nX Lossless Decoder(XLD) is a tool for\n  Mac OS X that is able to\n  decode/convert/play various 'lossless'\n  audio files. The supported audio files\n  can be split into some tracks with cue\n  sheet when decoding.

For best results during playback, Apple recommends converting MP3 files greater than 32 megabytes (MB) to AAC format. For AAC audio files, Apple recommends the following specifications:\n\n*Audio Format: Baseline Low-Complexity Profile with AAC-LC (Music)\n\n*Data Rate: Up to 160 Kbps\n\n*Channels: Stereo in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov formats\n\n*Output Sample Rate: 48 kHz\n\n*Encoding Quality: Better\n\n\nA: The easiest and most iOS compatible way to transfer your cd's to your computer, is to import them via iTunes.\nJust pop your cd in, launch iTunes and click on the import button.\nIf you want a lossless codec, then you may choose Apple's own \"Apple Lossless Encoder\". That way you wont have to edit any settings, the full quality will be preserved!\nAccording to wikipedia, the compressed files will be about 40% - 60% of original file's size, so if you have small capacity iOS devices, their file size should be considered.\nThe same goes for Flac to Apple Lossless, but there you should use a third party software. The good thing is that by choosing Apple Lossless, there will be no options to edit. Just select the codec, convert your flac's and then import them to iTunes for iOS sync.\n\nA: iTunes and iPods support a lossless compressed format - Apple lossless. Max will convert FLAC to Apple Lossless including conversion of tags (I am not certain if all are converted ut the main ones are in my experience)\nThere is a comparison of the relative sizes of the commpressed files made in 2005\n", "Q: How can I synchronize contacts with Google? How can I download (also, possibly upload from my iPhone) contacts of my Google account?\n\nA: On your iPhone, you can set up an Exchange account, and enable Contacts synchronization.\nAssuming you're on Mac OS X, you can also set up Google Synchronization with Address Book app and Contact synchronization with iTunes.\nI've had issue with the former concerning the addresses, the city, postal code, etc. fields weren't correctly mapped. YMMV. On the plus side, the modification made to either Gmail or the iPhone are immediately applied to the other.\nThe second works fine for me, the downside is that you have to connect your iPhone to your computer when you want to share the modifications you made to the contacts.\n", "Q: Mac OS X startup config Back to Mac OS 9, there was a way to create startup configs (to include or not some extensions to the OS). This was a built-in feature of Mac OS.\nIs there a way to manage this on OS X ?\n\nA: Since OS X no longer has extensions per se managing them is not necessary. (Thankfully)\nI still have horrifying memories of managing different extensions which had varying degrees of incompatibility often requiring different load orders and multiple reboots to straighten out.\nHere is an excellent article, although old, that still outlines the OS X system startup process:\nLink\nThe closest thing to an extension manager is this freeware utility that manages items in your Library folders, allowing you to enable/disable them.

Is there a way to accelerate the boot process? Can we disable some (rarely used or not useful) services?\n\nA: I do not know of a way of shortening the actual boot time: from power on to login dialog window. You might however be able to shorten your login time by removing items from your login items list.\nYou can find the list of user login items here: System Preferences → Accounts →  → Login items.\nRemove stuff that has been added there that you do not want. Use some common sense though. E.g. if you use a calendar app that notifies you of appointments, it might be a bad idea to remove the calendar helper app from your list of login items.\n\nA: Give yourself something to watch while booting and it will appear to be quicker.\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\"\n\n\nA: This article (that I wrote) explains how to improve login speed by staggering the launch of your startup items.\nIt may or may not apply to your particular situation, but it frequently helps.\n", "Q: Will I automatically get lifetime FREE updates if I buy an iPhone app? If I buy a paid iPhone app, will I be able to get free updates for the rest of the lifetime of that app or should I pay later for the updates? \nWhat's the norm? Can you perhaps give 1-2 examples?\n\nA: Not entirely. The App Store doesn't allow for paid upgrades of the same application, say v1.0 to v1.1. But there is little to stop a developer from releasing the next version of an app as a separate purchase, v1.1 to v2.0.\n\nA: Typically free.  They can make an new version; that happened a lot when the iPad came out.\n", "Q: Fastest way to convert .avi files for itunes? I've experimented with Handbrake and VLC and I'd like to know the fastest possible method to convert .avi file into a a file that is readable by itunes so I can stream it to my TV via my Apple TV 2. \nThe mentioned solutions require a couple of hours and I'd like to improve this. I'm working on a macbook air.\nThanks.\n\nA: You're not going to find a magic bullet that can dramatically speed up your conversion. You really have two options: either reduce the quality of your target file, or throw more iron at it. Upgrading your hardware (including possibly putting more RAM in your machine) would help a lot.\nThe bottom line, though, is that the conversion app has to look at the whole file frame by frame and convert it, and that's an O(n) proposition--the time it takes scales linearly with the amount of data to convert, and there just aren't good ways for even a very clever program to shortcut that. Some programs may be fractionally more efficient than others, but in general, the algorithm takes as long as it takes to chew as much data as it has to chew.\n\nA: I usually play around with Video Monkey. \n\nVideo Monkey is a free video encoding application exclusively for Mac. It was created after the demise of the great tool Visual Hub. Video Monkey borrows heavily from the Visual Hub video conversion tool, both conceptually and from the original code dump posted to SourceForge as TranscoderRedux.\n\n\nA: The Elgato Turbo.264 HD is a hardware solution, but it might be worth it if you have a lot of files to convert.\n", "Q: How can I convert a pdf to a format that is compatible with iBooks I have a pdf file, which I would like to convert to iBook compatible format, which software can I use to do this? calibre seems to be too tough to work with\n\nA: The good news: you don't have to! iBooks will happily take PDF files and display them just fine and dandy.\n", "Q: Should I install Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server? I will be using Mac OS X Server to hold an email server, web hosting, DNS and iOS and Mac development and I was wondering if you guys think Mac OS X Snow Leopard would do me just fine or if Server would be the best bet. So far, when setting up server tools on Snow Leopard it seems to be tedious but from the overview page on Apple's website, Server seems to be able to perform tasks with ease. Should I just use Snow Leopard or go for the Server?\n\nA: It depends on how good you are at configuring the relevant services in Unix-land. All the services you mentioned can be run from the non-server version, but OS X Server has that sort of thing pre-configured and maybe even a nice GUI for management purposes.\n\nA: The admin tools that OS X Server provides for DNS configuration almost justify its use on its own. Combined with your needs of email, web, and development hosting, definitely go with Server. I will assume you have the appropriate hardware for running OS X server, because a regular iMac won't do; you need either an Xserve (no longer manufactured, but available used) or a Mac Pro (a Mac Mini Server might suffice, but it will be sluggish). \n", "Q: Sound and heat when lid is closed - MacBook Air Can you damage screen or something because of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Playing loud music when lid is down?\n\n*Running some processor/videocard-intensive applications that heat the laptop, while lid is down?\n\nA: Playing loud music? I doubt it. The sound probably won't sound as good (as it'll be muffled), but it'll work.\nHeat? Maybe. I have an older MacBook Pro that gets its airflow in through the speaker grilles and out through the hinge. I don't run it when closed for that reason, but that is supported (it wasn't on my even older iBook G4). If you can wake it up with the lid closed, it'll probably work fine. Try it a few times and see if the screen is uncomfortably hot after a half hour or 45 minutes.\n", "Q: Xcode and Apple Software Update Some of my coworkers receive updates to Xcode through the regular software update mechanism in OSX. I however have always had to manually download it from Apple and install it myself.\nWhat's the difference between us? Neither I nor they know why. How can I get Software Update to recognize Xcode?\nAlso, I understand that Xcode 4 is available from the App Store and that will (or at least should) be updated. That's not the point. I want Xcode <4 to be updated via Software Update.\n\nA: Edited to add\nBased on the comments on this answer, it appears that Xcode updates via the system Software Update were delayed, appearing quite a bit after they became available for manual download from the developer portal. \nIt may even be that Apple fits them into times when their network usage was low, which could delay an update even if you clear out your old copy and reinstall the not-quite-up-to-date version. Perhaps the update would appear if you waited several days.\n\nPrevious answer\nXcode has never, ever updated for me through Software Update, and it's never updated for the dozen or so developers I work with. The Apple employees that I follow on Twitter -- guys like Jake Behrens, Michael Jurewitz (the dev tools evangelist), Chris Hanson, and Bill Bumgarner -- along with former Apple employees who are devs and other high-profile devs I follow, all tweet something along the lines of, \"hey devs, time to visit the developer portal to download the new version of Xcode\" when an update comes out.\nAre you absolutely certain Xcode updates are arriving automatically for your coworkers? Have you seen it happen? Are you sure they're not pulling your leg? I've certainly never heard of it and consistently hear the opposite, so it sure seems unlikely to me.\nThe only automatic Xcode updating I'm aware of for Xcode 4, and only then if it was purchased through the Mac App Store and not downloaded from the portal, and only then if you launch the App Store and click on the update, which really isn't very automatic. \n\nA: If Software Updater is not picking up your Xcode installation, that would suggest your Xcode installation plist is possibly corrupted. Did you do the proper \nsudo <Xcode>/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=...\n\ncommand to properly uninstall Xcode before installing the newer Xcode4 GM?\nI've seen the problem you're reporting when my students \"stacked\" the install, i.e. install Xcode3 on top of a previous Xcode3 without uninstalling the older Xcode first.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I just tried to update to Xcode 4.2 and was told no updates were available.\nI then noticed I had 'Install xcode' as an /Application and after deleting this, I could then install the update by clicking Install in the AppStore in Lion.\nWhat a pain!\n\nA: I've been told that this was because the co-workers installed with all the default options. I had changed some options during the install.\nEither way, ever since Lion Xcode has been distributed via the App Store so it's moot.\n", "Q: A better configuration to do development? currently I have a mac mini:\n\nHardware Overview :\nModel Name: Mac mini\n  Model Identifier: Macmini2,1\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:  1,83 GHz\n  Number Of Processor:  1\n  Total Number Of Core: 2\n  L2 Cache: 2 Mo\n  Memory:   1 Go\n  Bus Speed:    667 MHz\n\nBasically it is a 2 years old mac mini.\nI installed XCode 4 recently. I want to leave Xcode 3 aside. And I am fed up with the slowness of that setup! What is your own experience of a configuration suitable to perform development with Xcode 4?\nTo give you an idea of my budget, I am considering buying a 27\" quad core iMac.\n\nA: The iMac you are considering will be much faster than your mini. One tip I have is to upgrade your RAM, Xcode will use it.\n\nA: Maximizing your RAM is the best investment for improving your computer speed. It will make a big difference, is fairly cheap, and is much cheaper than a new computer.\n\nA: Yves, my experience suggests you may have different configurations depending on your mobility needs.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you develop at home (presumably for consumer market) so you don't need to demo to customer, and presumably you don't need to code when you're attending conferences e.g. WWDC, then I'd recommend an iMac with maxed RAM and another external display. Don't need to spend for big internal hard disks since external ones are cheaper (than Apple) and you're not mobile anyways.\n\n*If you travel, attend conferences (e.g. WWDC, NSConference, etc), and/or demo to your customer, then you should get a MacBook Pro with maxed RAM, and either maxed hard disk or SSD (which unfortunately tends to be expensive at larger storage size).\n\n\nIn other words, I'm suggesting the decision factors are 1) mobility, 2) RAM (for speed), 3) display (enough for doc and your code side by side), 4) storage (Apple Developer videos take up a lot of space).\nHope this helps. Please don't forget to mark your question as answered after reading all the answers shared by everyone here, thanks.\n\nA: XCode use more memory. But if you want develop for iphone and use iPhoneSimulator i would buy a big resolution monitor, for comfortable use XCode :) On my MacBookPro 13\" (1280x800) it look not so good, as when i connect monitor with 1440x900. \n", "Q: Questions on Mac OS X from a web developer who is new to Mac I'm getting ready to buy a MacBook Pro 15\", but would like some help regarding a few things.\n\n\n*\n\n*I witnessed somebody using a tool that showed all web requests' request headers / content, response headers / content, URL, port, other meta info, etc, sort of like a \"Live HTTP Headers\" on steroids (I thought it was a stand-alone piece of software, but maybe it's just a browser add-on). Do you know what the tool I'm speaking of is called?\n\n*Mac OS X comes with Apache and listens at port 80 by default. This is no good, if you're developing an application (a Django app) and you want it listening on port 80 during development (not using Apache). Can I stop Apache from listening on port 80 or disable it altogether, or is it required for OS X (or some built-in software) to operate?\n\n*MOST IMPORTANT: For about 3 days I had a high-res 15\" but had to return it due to the fonts being difficult to read. I was able to cope with certain of the apps, but my code editor's text looked blurry no matter the font size, and a couple other apps' fonts did as well. Is there a trick to getting your fonts to look crisp on the high-res display (such as how Windows has ClearType settings, etc), or should I change fonts? I believe I only used Consolas during the 3 days.\n\n*Are their any other tools (aside from Firefox add-ons) that you would recommend to a software / web developer who's new to Mac?\n\n\nA: The first sounds like Wireshark, which you can install from Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew.\nThe second, you don't need to run the built-in Apache at all.  System Preferences > Internet & Wireless > Sharing, uncheck \"Web Sharing\".\nThe only real font control in OSX is System Preferences > Personal > Appearance, where you can control whether font smoothing is done at all and at what size OSX stops trying to smooth small fonts.  Some people don't handle smoothing well, so turning it off can be useful.  (Smoothing is done by borrowing and halftoning neighboring pixels, so the fonts really are fuzzy.  Some people find it easier to read, some harder.)\n\nA: *\n\n*It could have been an add-on, running in a separate window which may have made it appear to be a standalone application. With Firefox, I use the excellent HttpFox add-on which provides all of what you describe here. \n\n*If you know how to configure Apache (via the configuration files), you will be able to do anything with it, including making it listen on a different or multiple ports. You could also install MAMP which is a LAMP/XAMP-esque bundle that includes Apache, MySQL and PHP for the Mac. It can be set up very easily.\n\n*You may have to look at the font-smoothing or anti-alias feature on Mac OS X. As someone else has already pointed out, you can play with different settings from within System Preferences > Appearance.\n\n*You will definitely want to look at a good editor/IDE to use for web development. You have multiple choices on the Mac, including: MacVim (or Vim on Terminal), TextMate, Coda, Aptana IDE, etc. You may want to look into version control for managing your code and docs. While Git, Mercurial, and Subversion, for example, can be used from the Terminal, there are nice GUIs for each available on Mac including: Tower for Git, MacHg, and Versions.\n\nA: There are lots of ways to inspect HTTP data. There is a Firefox extension called, \"Live HTTP Headers\", which can operate as a Sidebar in Firefox itself, or can be popped out and have it's own window (which may look like a \"standalone application\"?). It does what it says on the cover.\nDepending on how technically you need to dive into HTTP inspection, you can do it with various webapps and awesome free apps.\nJust last night I used Hurl.it (yes, wonderful name, I know) to send rudimentary HTTP POST requests. I've used HTTP Client.app (Desktop app) to great success, and there is also the classic wireshark, or tcpdump to get loads of technical information. tcpdump comes standard on OSX, as a matter of fact.\n\nA: Re the fuzzy screen... I recently discovered that when connecting to a LCD display with a VGA cable, it does this trick where it approximates its resolution as if it were talking to a CRT, often resulting in nasty moire patterns and strangeness. It's approximating the size of each pixel, pushing out pixels that aren't an exact match for the size of the physical LCD pixels, resulting in blurring and moire patterns. That's how you drive a CRT, where the pixels are generated in the gun at the back and they hit the screen wherever they hit the screen, but it messes up on an LCD.\nThe solution is to use a DVI cable. When you do that, the machine is actually talking individually to each physical pixel on the display, and it's super crisp and nice.\nIf you noticed regular vertical stripes of blurriness on the display, that's what's going on.\n", "Q: User folder on 2nd partition with link? I have a hackintosh system. Fully working one.\nI have a secondary partition called \"Storage\". I would like to move my user folder from /Users/\"Username\" to \"Storage\"/\"Username\".\nAfterward create a link from \"Storage\"/\"Username\" to /Users/\"Username\"\nIs this possible? Anyone tried?\nDon't wanna brake system before trying.\n\nA: You can use a symbolic link to do this. I used it on an old mac which required the OS to be within a certain distance from the beginning of the drive, so I had to partition my hard drive to ensure that it would be there. To create a symbolic link, you need to use the command ln -s <source> <destination> in Terminal.\nHowever, it would be better to use the advanced options in the Accounts preference pane to move your home folder's location. You will need to unlock the preferences if required (using the lock icon in the bottom left corner), then right click on your account name and change the location of your home directory. Since you are putting it on a separate partition, the path will start with /Volumes/PartitionName. Copy the folder over to the other partition before changing this setting! Then log out and back in and it should be using the new home folder, and you will be able to delete the old one. You can still create the symbolic link just in case some applications improperly assume that your home folder is in the /Users folder.\n", "Q: Can iPad show percentage when charging by USB, and does iPad 2 charge slowly too? I found that my iPad might be half charged after a few hours by USB from PC... too bad I can't find the wall adapter...  but when I turn it on, it says \"Not charging\" without saying the Percentage it already has charged up.  Can it show somehow?  Maybe by tapping the \"Not charging\" message but I don't really need to see it so many times. (but tapping doesn't work)\nDoes the iPad 2 also have the same issue of slow charging too?\n\nA: The reason you get the Not Charging message is because most machines don't send enough power through USB to charge the iPad. The iPads battery is more like a laptop battery than a phone battery. Newer Macs will send enough power over some of their USB ports. \nAs for the percentage, If you turn on \"Battery Percentage\" I think under Settings, General, Usage. This should show it up in the top right. \nDue to the iPad 1 and 2 sharing many other similarities, the iPad 2 should also display the 'not charging' message. Although, a new iPad 2 will come with a Wall Charger as well. You can purchase off-brand chargers on amazon or ebay, extra wall chargers at the apple store, and some third party companies make chargers like Griffin \n", "Q: Timeline slider does'nt always show up while listening to iPod Touch I have noticed that, sometimes, the slider that represents the entire duration of a podcast and showing the current reading position (the one that you're able to move to go forward or backward rapidly) is not present in the UI. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not...\nHow can it be explained ? Is there a trick to make this slider hidden and shown ?\n\nA: The slider/speed controls as well as any lyrics, show notes, etc can be toggled on and off by simply tapping on the album cover/artwork once while in the iPod \"Now Playing\" screen\n", "Q: how to know imac crash reason last day i put my mac on the whole night for downloading xcode.however today i noticed that it is shutdown in the morning.i used the \"last\" command to know when it was shutdown.it is showing time 11:00am and a word crash besides.how can i know the reason for this crash.is there any tool or utility to know the reason.is there any log of it stored in mac\n\nA: Use Mac OS X's Console (found in /Applications/Utilities) to monitor your system logs by filtering their contents.\nCheck first system.log and console.log. Logs display their information in reverse chronological order,  scroll down to reach content around 11:00am.\n", "Q: Is an iMac upgradable to a 256 GB SSD? Can an i5 27 inch iMac with an exsisting 1 TB hard drive be upgraded to have an additional 256 GB SSD and if so, is it possible to remove Mac OSX from hard disk and re-install on SSD disk?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to replace your internal SATA drive with an SSD.\nRead the iFixit iMac Intel 27'' Teardown guide to make sure you have all the tools/space to do that, it's not hard, but it requires you to be careful and do it with patience, especially when removing the screen (which must be done using suction cups).\nYou can replace the Optical Drive with a Data Doubler and install any SATA drive in it. For example using the OWC Data Doubler. Plan all this ahead, since you only want to do the iMac disassembly once. ;)\nMake sure that the Data Doubler is compatible with your model (if not available you might have to wait a few weeks before they release a compatible model, it has always been like that).\nThat way you'll have an additional SSD Drive.\nRegarding the second part of your question, yes, you can either put the original drive (1TB) in the Optical Drive and put the SSD where the original HDD was or you can install the SSD in the Data Doubler and boot from there.\nYou can always install OS X in the SSD, boot from it, migrate some information from your 1TB drive and when you're ready, format the old 1TB drive and use it as a secondary drive for whatever evil purposes you want, like to store your Home Folder (search Ask Different for instructions on how to do that).\n\nA: It is possible and Martin's answer has the details.  OWC offers a Turnkey Service to perform that upgrade: http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/turnkey/iMac_2010_27.  They can fit up to three SSDs into a 27\" iMac if you like.\n", "Q: Is iphone purchased from Canadian online Apple Store factory unlocked? I could not find iphone stack exchange site so I am posting here.\nOn Canadian Apple store iphone 4 is available for $659. Is this iphone 4 is the same iphone as factory unlocked new iphone 4 being sold on ebay for over $800? I am confused about the price difference if they are exactly same phones. Also would this iphone work with any GSM carrier in USA or other countries?\n\nA: Yes, they are unlocked,  The price is going to be substantially higher since its not the subsidized price. They will work with any compatible GSM carriers including prepaid providers. \nSome carriers (for instance T-Mobile USA) currently operate at a different radio frequency for their 3G data than the iPhone supports, so although being able to access data over the EDGE network (slower network that is used on virtually all GSM networks), it will not be able to take advantage of those 3G data services. \nPurchases from the apple store online can only be shipped to the country of that specific apple store. So if you live in an area where they don't offer the unlocked versions of the phone, for instance in USA, the only way you would be able to get the unlocked version would be through someone who can have it shipped to their country.

There are some files I created with the laptop on this hard drive.\nNow, I can only read those files with my Mac notebook \nI can't write any file on the hard dirve.\nHow can I enable write access on my hard drive ?\n\nA: You need to install 3rd-party software for this, by default OS X just support reading NTFS, not writing.\nDownload and install MacFUSE and NTFS-3G.\n\nA: Depending on how many files you have on your external drive and how much space you have on your MacBook, you can also just copy all the files on the external drive to a temporary folder on your MacBook.  Then use Disk Utility to format the drive for OS X (wont be readable by Windows machines, but will be able to use with Time Machine) or FAT32 (4GB size limit for each file).

I am considering purchasing something like Sennheiser MM450 Bluetooth Headphones but I'd like to get some input on whether the Back/Next/Play/Pause/Answer buttons work as expected with iPhone 4?\nI've seen some old reviews that said not, but nothing about iPhone 4 / iOS 4.x..\n\nA: Yes. The iPhone 4 has Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR wireless technology meaning it supports stereo audio and controls. Personally I have these and they have answer/volume +/-/ skip/back/play/pause buttons that all work with iPhone 4.\n\nA: Older iOS versions had an extremely finicky Bluetooth AVRCP implementation, but since iOS 3 it works reliably with many more devices.  The Motorola S9-HD is one of the devices which didn't work well with older iOS, as attested by many reviews; I have one, and while it was indeed flaky under iOS 2, it's been solid ever since iOS 3 came out.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make Modbook-style tablets from MacBook Pros ...? I ask this question because the Axiotron website and their Facebook presence seems to suggest stasis and/or the end of the company. Hence the DIY approach.\nA few years back I lusted after a Modbook from Axiotron - they would take your Macbook and put a touchscreen panel on the top. This would give you a tablet with some serious grunt and connectivity.\nI was wondering if it would be possible to do something similar with my current 13\" MacBook Pro and, if so, how difficult/expensive/tricky would it be? I'm not bothered about multi-touch (tho it would obviously be very nice), just basic point, click/double click, drag functionality.\n\nA: You may want to look at this neowin.net forum post. A poster provides a detailed guide to converting an older plastic macbook into a working tablet.\nUnfortunately, applying his approach to a newer unibody MacBook or MacBook Pro would be difficult since much of the structural rigidity of those notebooks lies in the keyboard plate. Cutting away that metal to fit your touch screen or pen tablet would leave only the relatively flimsy outer shell to support the notebook. Axiotron addressed this problem in their proposed (and now probably dead) Modbook Pro by building their own housing for the MacBook internals.\n\nA: I tried doing this with a Macbook Air. Just take off the hinges and fold the screen to the back. Make sure all wires are secure using crazy glue and tape\n", "Q: How do I sync Outlook 2011 and Google Calendar? I am using Outlook 2011 for Mac (the office uses Exchange) and have some Google Calendars I am using for home. How do I get 2-way sync working between Outlook and Google? I could do this with iCal but its Exchange support is sorely lacking and therefore not an option.\n\nA: I don't believe this feature is available yet (ever?).  You may be able to get this going by having Outlook sync with your iCal, and have iCal sync with your Google cal.  Even that though, (Outlook sync with iCal) isn't available yet, and probably the biggest gripe Mac users have with Outlook ATM.  I wouldn't be too surprised if there's a 3rd party plugin or piece of software that will do that for you by now.  Honestly though, I think you're out of luck.\n\nA: I finally found a work around to synchronize Outlook 2011 with Google Calendar!\nFirst I set up Sync Services to sync my Outlook 2011 calendar to iCal calendar. I make sure that I have all the categories that I want to have in my Outlook and create some event for each category so that it gets created in the iCal calendar as well.\nThen I downloaded this software called \"Spanning Sync 3\", installed it and set it up with my Google account (Spanning Sync is a paid software with a 15 day trial if you want to try it first). After that, I can do the setup for syncing the iCal with the Google Calendar by mapping the categories in iCal to the categories in the Google account.\nWhat happens is that when you create, modify or delete an event in Outlook, this event gets synced to iCal which in turn gets picked up by Spanning Sync and syncs to Google Calendar. Similarly, any changes in Google Calendar gets synced to iCal via Spanning Sync which in turn gets synced back to Outlook. This solution does not involve CalDAV to sync to Google Calendar.\nHope this will help someone else out there :)\n\nA: one way sync is possible, but I didn’t hear for 2 way sync between Outlook 2011 & Google Calendars. Recently I had posted a blog for synchronization of Mac Outlook calendars to Google calendar, you can try this method once. And as I am hoping somehow it will assist you.\nSource Blog Link: http://mailtroubleshooter.tumblr.com/post/109556653818/how-to-sync-mac-outlook-calendar-with-google\n", "Q: How can I get an (iMovie-created) movie in the Videos app into iOS iMovie to edit it? I can't find any way to get a video in the Apple Videos app into iMovie on the ipad to edit it.  \nIn my specific use case, I have a trailer I made in iMovie on my mac that I can see and watch in the videos app, but neither that nor any of the other videos there appear under \"video\" as a source for imovie.   (The only thing that does is a movie I took in the app itself.)\nI already confirmed that location services are on and enabled for iMovie on the ipad.   Am I missing something?\nAs a rough workaround, is there any way to export from videos (without syncing)?  I'd be able to crudely solve my problem if I could get the video into dropbox.  \n\nA: iMovie only supports the H.264 format, and will only load videos from two places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Camera Roll\n\n*Synced iPhoto Library via iTunes (Photos Tab → Sync Photos from iPhoto → Include Videos)\n\n\nAs you've noticed, videos in your iTunes → Movies folder will only sync to the Videos app, and will not appear in iMovie.\nThe process is not at all convenient, but here's a video detailing how to convert a video to the right format on a Mac, and then get it into iMovie on an iPad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF8-sDmD_1Y.  He uses an app called StreamClip Video Converter to convert to H.264.  You might be able to get away with exporting that format from iMovie on your Mac instead.  iMovie is picky about the format though.  If you have trouble, try to reproduce the settings in the video exactly.\n\nA: In addition to Rick's solution, there is another platform independent, broadband dependent method you can use. There might be a minor loss in quality, but its well above acceptable.\nSimply upload you videos to YouTube, and re-download them using the 'Download as MP4' option. YouTube re-encodes your videos to a format which work perfectly in iMovie. You might also want to rename your videos in the 'IMG_XXXX' format (XXXX = 4 digit number), since that's the naming scheme used in the Photos App.\nI prefer this method since MPEGStreamClip is buggy on Windows and other free programs usually cause greater loss in quality than the YouTube transcodes.\n", "Q: Change iPad keyboard by modifying system files I want to access the iPad system files on my computer, so that I can modify them to change one of the iPad keyboards to support my language.\nHowever, when I plug the iPad to my Windows 7 PC, Windows opens it as a storage device with only some wallpaper. I can't see any system files.\nHow do I access the system and content files for the iPad?\n\nA: Jailbreak your iPad using http://evasi0n.com and you will have total access to the filesystem.\n\nA: A certain number of custom keyboards are available on the App Store... maybe this could be the easiest solution for you.\n\nA: To access the file system on an iPad you will need to jailbreak it. Then you can install ssh and use that to access the filesystem. This guide provides some details.\nThe reason that you aren't able to see the system files on the iPad when you simply connect it to your computer is because you aren't meant to. Apple hides all of the internal system details to keep the iPad a simple to use consumer device. Most people don't need to modify or even see the system files. Before heading straight for the system internals, consider there may be a simpler way to achieve your goal.\n\nA: You will definitely need to jailbreak (which i recommend evasi0n.com for), and then you will probably want to download the cydia app called iFile. iFile allows you to view and edit a wide range of files directly from your iPad. It costs some money but it is worth it.\nIf you're looking for something free or need to manage the files from you computer i recommend PhoneBrowse by iMobie.com. \n\nA: The recommended approach is to add the keyboard for the desired language by enabling it within the Settings app. On your iPad, go to Settings app → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard..., and select the keyboard of your choice. Of late, iOS has evolved to include support for a wide variety of languages and this approach should be taken first.\nThe intended approach as discussed in the question is neither possible and straightforward, nor is it recommended for attempting to add support for a new language in your iPad keyboard. Also, it isn't advisable to jailbreak your iOS device just for the sake for changing keyboard language.\nAdditionally, starting with iOS 8, Apple has enabled support for 3rd-party keyboard apps. A lot of such apps are now available on the App Store, and you should be able to find the one that fits your requirements. Alternatively, you can also write your own keyboard app that best suits your needs.\nYou can Learn more about keyboard settings by reading this Apple Support article, About the keyboards settings on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n", "Q: How can I tell when Turbo Boost is active on my MacBook? I have one of the core i7 MacBooks, and I'm wondering if there is a way to see when Turbo Boost is active (other than the fact that the laptop gets really hot and the fan kicks on). \nI use iStat to monitor CPU activity, but that doesn't show Turbo Boost activity.\n\nA: Check out the Intel Power Gadget.

Firefox 4 is out and I'm a little bit worried about the lack of compatibility of my loved Addons on this new version.\nCan I install Firefox 4 to try it without the need to upgrade the 3.6.15 version?\n\nA: Yes, you can have both versions. In fact you can install the new Firefox in your home directory's Application folder (and it will be only accessible with your account). If you don't have ~/Applications folder, you can create it (and Finder will mark it with the same icon as the /Applications one). Note that you cannot use both versions simultaneously. You can also rename the Firefox.app to Firefox 4.app, and install it in /Applications - it'll work flawlesly.\nps. I prefer the first method - Install applications that I'm testing in my home Applications folder, and when I'm sure they're ok, move them/replace application in /Applications.\n\nA: OS X: Install and Run Firefox 3 and Firefox 4 on the Same Computer | Mozilla Firefox | Tech-Recipes\nOr just make copies of ~/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist and  ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/.\n\nA: Once you install it in separate directories, you can in fact run them both simultaneously. \nIt just takes a little Firefox flags magic as explained here in this article. \n", "Q: fast forward a video with keyboard I have tried ⌥+→ and ⌘+→, but no luck.

I've got a movie in iMove and I'd like to burn it to DVD. I used the \"iDVD\" export option in iMovie, but then iDVD refused to burn the DVD on the grounds that the DVD didn't have enough space.\nHow do I burn a few hours (~5 GB) of video to a DVD? I'm okay lowering the quality a bit, if I knew where in iMovie or iDVD to do so.\n\nA: For the easy solution, in iDVD, you have to go to the Project Info Window (Project|Project Info... menu) and select a Double-Layer disc in the DVD Type combobox.\nA single layer disc is 4,2GB and an untouched 5GB movie file will obviously not fit on it.  \nIf you don't have a double-layer capable burner, you will have to first reduce the quality of the video to reduce its size (through the widely used (and easy to use) Handbrake for example), putting the target size to circa 4GB. You will then be able to burn your file with iDVD or any other DVD authoring tool.  \niDVD control of video file compression is too simple.\nIn iMovie, in Share|Export You have several size options. Putting the mouse pointer on the little information symbol at the end of each line will give you the approximative size of the output file. I don't know if there is a finer control of output. I usually do it via Handbrake, as stated above.\n", "Q: Long iPhone voice memos won't import to my Mac I recorded a lengthy meeting today in two parts.  The first part was 20 minutes, and it was easily imported to my Mac.  The second, about 55 minutes, will not sync.  It is still on the phone, but I want to transfer it to my computer so that I can create an MP3 version.\nCan anyone tell me whats wrong?\n\nA: Yesterday I just created a 2h recording using the standard Apple's Voice Memo and \"imported\" seamlessly to my Mac, no issues at all. It went to my music library in an album \"Voice Memos\".\nI can only say there's nothing special that should cause such an issue and I confirmed it. What I would do in your case is checking the Console hoping for some informative warning and trying to record another file and see how that goes.\nBut there's a good chance you've got it and is just not finding it, like other dudes. Worst case scenario, get iPhone Explorer and grab them manually. There are some steps you might want to follow and see if it helps in you case. The first one is: Restart you mac.\n", "Q: Youtube slow on iPhone over wifi I received a new iPhone yesterday and connected it to my home Wifi network.\nOn content heavy sites it runs perfectly fine, but if I use either the Youtube site or the Youtube app I can't watch anything. It takes forever to watch 5 seconds of video.\nMy first question is, how can I be sure that my phone is using local Wifi for the internet connection and Youtube app (it says connected in the settings, but is there an icon in the display etc. to confirm Wifi connection)?\nAny suggestions as to why Youtube runs slow when other heavy sites load without problem?\n\nA: If you have a slow download speed then that might be the problem.\nThis is what you should do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the settings and choose \"airplane mode\" then activate the Wi-fi to force the phone to only use it.\n\n*Now you need to reboot the device by holding the \"home\" and \"sleep/wake\" at the same time for about 10 seconds. This resets the ram and gives you the best chances. \n\n\nYour IPhone 4 has 512 mb ram which is plenty. and you are running 4.2.1 which is ok. (4.3 has a faster JavaScript motor but may give you worse battery life.) \nNow choose a video clip and play it either from the youtube player or from Safari (it might be faster). \nGoodluck!\n\nA: The wifi icon (click here to see how you could have found about it on your own) is the top bar, right between the carrier and the clock, and it replaces 3G or E. It looks like this: \nLike Alvar said, best way to be sure is getting in Airplane mode and turning wifi on.\nAs for youtube not working while others do, it's probably blocked. This could be on the wifi or on the iPhone, if it's a company phone with a provisioning profiles blocking it or if it's jailbroken and got a firewall on it. Just check if youtube works on any other device on the same wifi and you'll know for sure where's the issue.\nIf youtube is just running slow, but it is running, it could also be your other heavy sites are cached. Without more info I can't think of more options for that issue.\n", "Q: Why setting image as its own icon with sips result a blurred icon? Are there any alternatives? I've successfully changed icons using the procedure described in an another question: Changing or setting a file or folder icon programmatically. Either my sips (or Finder) got broken afterwards or I just zoomed in for the first time (it seems the icon is sharp from ≈100x100 downwards), but, anyway, the icon that sips -i image.png creates is blurry/pixelated:\n\nWhat I did before the blurrification:\n$ cp FIN-2.png FIN-3.png\n$ sips -i FIN-3.png\n\nSo FIN-2 and FIN-3 are the same. FIN-2 is a 512x512 PNG-file\nFurthermore: using sips breaks all further attempts when trying to set a custom icon even with any GUI method and with any file in any folder.\nOnly cure is to delete ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.finder/ and restart Finder. Then changing icon via GUI (drag&drop, copy&paste) works normally with any file.\n\nTwo main questions—and answering to either one probably solves the problem close enough for me:\n\n\n*How can I set an image as an icon programmatically without using sips -i (= sips --addIcon) in the process? (again, refer to the other question for more comprehensive info)\n\n\n*\n\n*Shell (bash) or AppleScript is preferred\n\n*I could convert the PNG to e.g. ICNS if needed.\n\n\n*Is sips broken? Why/How? Can it be fixed; how? (Or is it the Finder? Or something else?)\n\n\nA: I think I've found a workaround!\nFirst off, install osxutils bundle which is a bit dated (2005) but nevertheless it works. (see the osxutils contents and man pages)\nPrepare the PNG to ICNS†—ironically you can use sips‡. Then use seticon from the osxutils bundle to change the icon:\n$ sips -s format icns FIN.png --out FIN.icns\n$ seticon -d FIN.icns FIN.png\n\nThe seticon also changes the file's attributes, ie. using SetFile -a C isn't necessary.\n\n†: Using a PNG as a source file for seticon changes the icon to a generic PNG icon, even with -d option. Furthermore, using seticon FIN.icns FIN.png changes the icon to a generic ICNS icon.

I have broken my issue into several parts hoping to make it easier to understand what I am trying to accomplish as well as what I have tried. Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!\nThe Goal\nInstall and boot Windows 7 Professional on a new Wintec 48G SSD via Expresscard 34 slot.Can this be done, if so has it been done before?\nBackground\nThe rationale behind installing Windows on the SSD is that I do not plan on using it often (need to run Win-only software at times). With this being said, I have heartburn slicing off a 32 gig partition of my main HDD to install Windows on and not be used but once every 2-3 weeks. If I can get it installed on the Wintec, in theory, I could remove it when not in use to save battery life and leave the port open for other devices. It is worth noting that I plan on storing all important data on the internal HDD based on several reviews of the Wintec.  \nIn the past, I have run virtual machines, but handful of the USB devices I use for work have not worked well (if at all). Also when running a VM, the speed of both the VM and OSX is greatly reduced including a crippled battery life. Because of these experiences, I am trying to stay clear of virtual machines for this particular build. On a side note on the virtual machines, I have seen a few examples of running a bootcamp partition using open source VM software. This would be the approach I would take if I went back to a VM.  \nWhile scouring the web, I have found lots of examples that the Wintec 48 gig is bootable with OSX (with much success from the looks of it). Over all, the most common way that I have seen to accomplish this is to use disk cloning software. This method works great for OSX, but I do not believe that it can be applied to the Windows 7 install.\nI have managed to boot from / run the Windows 7 installer for both 64bit and 32bit versions. On both installers I have made it to the point of selecting the HDD to install to and receive an error message stating that the system cannot boot from this device (Wintec) and to check the BIOS settings. This makes perfect sense on a normal PC, but with the Mac not having a BIOS I have run out of ideas.\nWhile trying to fix this problem, I have tried formatting the SSD in NTFS 3G, NTFS Compressed, NTFS,  FAT-32 and unused space.  The hope was to format the drive using Disk Utility and  have the Windows Installer format it to what Win 7 required.  After approximately 6 hours of testing, I have concluded that it was a losing battle and begun reaching out to the communities for help.\nSystem Information\nHardware: MacBookPro4,1 (2008 non-unibody), 4G RAM, Expresscard 34 Wintec 48G SSD\nSoftware: Running OSX 10.6.6.  Wish to install Windows 7 Pro (64 bit preferred)\n\nA: I use Parallels to run Windows on my MacBook Pro 5,1 \nI boot from my SSD 64GB and have my Parallels image on the SSD. \nIt runs super fast! It takes 14 seconds to boot up Win 7.\n\nA: this might help you for a start?\nI've got the same problem right now, but using 96GB version of that card.\nedit: http://forums.macnn.com/104/alternative-operating-systems/397685/windows-7-on-expresscard-ssd/\n\nA: Have been working on this for weeks. It appears the computer will not recognize the SSD at all when booted into Windows. I have installed Win 7 on another partition on the internal drive, booted, gotten it to recognize and use the SSD as an external drive. If I install it in the 34 slot, it never shows up. Plugged into USB, it shows and can be used, but cannot be installed to. I tried downloading drivers from Wintec, but the \"drivers\" that I downloaded are not the right thing at all (even though that is where the site takes me), but instead are for some kind of RAID setup having nothing to do with the SSD.\nNext step is to try finding a firmware update from Apple. Apparently there is a problem common to ALL 34 slot devices on the MBP not being recognized in Win 7 at least. Even if I can get it to recognize it, though, there is no guarantee that I can install Win 7. If I clone it, I can get it to appear bootable, but that ends up taking me to an OS missing error.\nI'll try to update if I make a breakthrough.\n", "Q: Alternative for Notepad++?

I have a first-generation Airport Express that has the common failure of simply not powering on. There are several sites showing how to open or repair the device, but all basically involve destroying the exterior and/or keeping it in two (exposed) parts afterwards.\nIs there any way to get this fixed without destroying it? I have no Apple Care - do Apple consider doing repairs (for less than the cost of a new one)? It seems like a waste to chuck it and buy a new one. Or perhaps it is announced as a manufacturing defect? I couldn't find anything like that. Any chance of a friendly Apple Store employee getting a replacement, at least saving the full cost? \n\nA: I don't believe that the Airport Express is considered a serviceable product. As you have seen from the repair sites it isn't easily opened. A repair from Apple isn't likely to be available or cost effective. It never hurts to ask though -- especially at the Genius Bar where they have some discretion depending on your situation.\nWithout destroying the exterior, you are likely faced with getting a replacement. You could save some money by buying a refurbished Airport Express from Apple.

Hi-res camera?\nBesides, you can't test an iPad app on the iPhone, so you'll need an iPad no matter what.\nEdit:\nAccording to the comment, an iPod Touch would be enough for you.\n\nA: As a developer and a designer I want to get my hands on every platform my software may be used on. For iOS I test on iPad, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and the simulator. But I only own an iPad and a 3GS, the others I borrow. I think it is also important to watch other people interact with my software using the different devices. These smart devices serve such different purposes for people that their expectations of how software should work on them varies widely.\nI recommend asking around and finding some friends who own and regularly use these devices to help test your software.\n\nA: If you plan on supporting any older devices in the market, you need to acquire the oldest slowest device which you plan on supporting, preferable one not upgraded beyond the oldest OS version which you plan on supporting.  Old used iPod Touch's from someplace like eBay might be suitable.\nIt's also important to test on a newer device running the most current iOS version (and at least two test devices if you want to test with any new iOS beta versions as well as the current release.)\n\nA: If I had to choose one, I would pick the newest iPhone because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's the only one that got all features and you can try anything you need in it\n\n*It have always been where most of the units (and money) are\n\n*It's generally easier to adapt things from iPhone to iPad than the other way around\n\n\nAs others said, there's a lot more to it than picking one and I do agree with the opinions already expressed. Of course it's better to know which features you need and adapt to your own requirements.\nBut if I'd had to choose only one to begin with, it's the iPhone.\n", "Q: Applescript (or other Quicksilver accessible thing) for hibernating a snow leopard mac? Anyone have a quick way, accessible from Quicksilver, to force your mac to hibernate?\n\nA: You can use Deep Sleep. It's a Dashboard widget that will put your mac into hibernation mode.\nEdit: from the website\n\nDeep Sleep can also be used as a command line utility\n\nFrom there, you can check out if QuickSilver can launch command line programs.\nYou can also package it in a .app -for example using Automator- and launch it with QuickSilver.\n~~\nCareful, be aware there's 2 sleep mode.\nThe normal one you can trigger using ⌥+⌘+Eject\nAnd the hibernate (or Safe Sleep) mode.\nYou can read about the differences between them here.\n\nA: Install SleepNow and then run that from QuickSilver.\n", "Q: Method for Combining Multiple Word Documents into One? Are there any methods for combining multiple Word documents into one big document in Mac?\n\nA: Insert > File. You have to do it one at a time, but it appears to work.\n\nA: Use Automator. It has a \"Combine Word Documents\" option as one of its premade Document Library items.\n\nA: In MS Word 2011 for Mac, no, there is no method for combining MULTIPLE files into one big document at the same time. You can, however, combine the files one at a time. Here's what you do: Click INSERT / FILE, and follow the prompts to insert one file at a time.\n\nA: In Word 15.40 (Office 2016 Mac), I've successfully merged multiple files into one with this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new document and use the View menu > Master Document option.\n\n*Open up a Finder window to the directory containing your files\n\n*Click and drag files into the new document. This should copy the contents into the master document.\n\n\nA: The Automator approach should work, but returns an error.\nI found a workaround: Nisus, another word processor for the mac, let's you simply drag in .docx files from the finder. I selected 120 files, dragged them in and it was done in three minutes.\n", "Q: Why isn't iPhone syncing Calendar items with Outlook? I am trying to set up a new (Verizon) iPhone to sync Contacts and Calender entries with Outlook 2007 on a Windows Vista Ultimate PC. The Contacts sync both ways, and calendar entries created in Outlook sync to the phone, but calendar entries created on the phone don't sync back to Outlook. I only have one calendar in Outlook. How can I get the calendar items created on the iPhone to sync back to Outlook?\n\nA: The best troubleshooting I have found for this problem is iPhone, iPad, iPod touch: Troubleshooting contact and calendar syncing via USB on Windows(Apple), mainly due to the fact that it explains how to reset sync history in iTunes, a process that reevaluates the contents of both devices and tries to resync them.\nAnother good little trick is to try a \"Replace data on this iPhone\" near the bottom of the info tab, that will wipe the specific data set off the iPhone and replace it with the computers, often a good way to get them talking to each other again.\n\nA: http://www.sync-iphone.com/contacts-calendars-email/sync-iphone-with-outlook.html#sync-iphone-with-outlook-two-way\n\n  \n*\n  \n*This is unfortunately a one-way synchronization from Outlook to iPhone.\n     To sync iPhone with Outlook two-way, use Google Calendar Sync\n  and select 2-way as the Sync option\n  \n*This procedure works for both Mac and PC\n  \n*Your calendars must be Outlook 2003 or above compatible\n  \n*Once you complete the above procedure, your iPhone Contacts will\n  synchronize every time you connect\n  your iPhone to your Computer\n  \n*In case of any iPhone Contacts synchronization problems, on your\n  iPhone go to Settings->Safari->Clear\n  Cookies and restart the Contacts\n  application (if your iPhone supports\n  multi-tasking, make sure you have\n  actually closed the Contacts app)\n  \n\nIf this isn't what you want, then you need to sync with an Exchange server, then you can do it in almost real time over the air. \n\nA: I'll share simple solution that worked for me.  My iPod Touch was syncing with calendar entries from Outlook 2007, but Outlook 2007 wasn't syncing with appointments entered on my iPod calender. As iPod Touch has same functionality as iPhone 4, I'm guessing the same resolution would work for iPhone also. Reason for discrepancies, was my default Calender on iPod, was set to a different Calendar than Outlook.  \nVerify \"Calendar\" is selected in Outlook 2007 under \"My Calendars\".\nOn iPod Touch:- Go to - \"Settings\"\n                Select - \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\"\n                Move down to - \"Calendar\" section\n                Select - \"Default Calendar\"\n                Select  - \"Calendar\" under \"From My PC\" heading (Blue dot)   \nNow go back to your iPod calendar and select \"List\" view.  Any appointments that don't have the blue dot will need to be modified, as basically only those with blue dot will sync to Outlook 2007.  \nTo Modify in \"List\" view:- Tap on appointment\n                           Select - \"Edit\"\n                           Under \"Calendar\" select \"Calendar\" \"From My PC\"\n                           Select \"Done\" x2 to return to Event Details\nNow you're all set.  Simply go to iTunes on your PC and \"Sync\" once again.  All should be in order.\n\nA: I would check on your iPhone that the events aren't being added to another calendar. In the calendar app when adding an event there is the option called Calendar which lets you select which calendar events are being added to. I would try creating some test events on your iPhone in different calendars if you have multiple. If events are created in a calendar that syncs over the air (i.e. mobileme, gmail, yahoo) those events won't sync via an iTunes tethered sync. Outlook 2007 is supported to sync by iTunes so they should be syncing both ways. Update to the latest version of iTunes and Outlook 2007 if its not already. If that doesn't work, I would try backing up your data in Outlook, then unchecking that selection to sync calendars with outlook in iTunes, sync and remove the data from the phone when prompted, then check the selection to sync the calendars with Outlook again and syncing the info back to the phone. Create some test events and see if events sync then. Hope this helps\n\nA: Maybe this will help someone having some issues syncing \"both ways\" with outlook/iphone calendars....\nSome background:\nMy boss got a new iPhone 4 and uses Outlook '03.  We were having issues getting his calendar items to sync back and forth, as he used his iPhone on the road/at home, and the Outlook '03 in the office.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Certain events were syncing back and forth, but others weren't.  It was partially syncing \"both ways\".  \n\n*He created an iCloud account, and set up his calendars to sync through iCloud, but did not install the iCloud Control Panel for Windows (yet).\n\n*The events that he created on the iPhone were \"iCloud home/work\" calendar events, as opposed to \"PC Calendar events\".\nSo, I went into his iPhone, changed the home/work(green/purple color) back to \"PC events (blue).  All of the sudden, the events were all syncing both ways.  Viola! \nSo, in final, make sure that with the iPhone 4/4S (iOS5) that you have iCloud set up TOTALLY. \nMy boss hadn't finished the process of creating his own \"iCloud\", therefore his iPhone wasn't able to send \"iCloud\" events to Outlook, because his PC had no clue what to do with iCloud, since the Control Panel wasn't installed.\nNow, if you have iCloud control panel set up on your PC/Mac, you should have no problem syncing both ways, but in this case, my boss didn't do his homework on iCloud and the Outlook syncing process.\n\nA: I recently ran into this same exact issue and, with the help from Sampson @ Apple, we worked thru the issue to resolve. Here is what we found.\nIn a nutshell:\n  You have a calendar entry, or two or three ..., that are corrupt, in some way, and it/they are affecting all the other items in your calendar syncing properly.\nSteps:\nDepending on the version of MS Office, the exact menu choices are different.\n\n\n*\n\n*But, either way, you want to creat a New Folder adjacent (not under) the existing \"Calendar\" and call it by any name you'd like (e.g.: New Calendar).\n\n*Make sure you set the Folder Contains field to be Calendar Items.\n\n*Now, go back to your original Calendar folder in OUTLOOK and change the view of your calendar to a List view.\n\n*Select ALL of the items in that list\n\n*Right-Click on any of the selected items and drag-n-drop them to your New Calendar folder ... Choose \"Move\" when given the option of Move or Copy\n\n*Now, Sync your iPhone\n\n*Now, create one new appointment in your ORIGINAL CALENDAR folder in OUTLOOK and Sync your iPhone, again.\n\n*If you see your one new entry, that's a good sign.  If not, you're going to have to refer to Apple for more help.\n\n*So, if your one new entry showed up, go back to your NEW CALENDAR folder, put it in List view format, and select SOME items and MOVE them back to the original CALENDAR folder.  Sync the iPhone.\n\n*Repeat this so long as these items you're moving back to CALENDAR are showing up on the iPhone.  At some point you should come across the calendar item(s) that caused this issue.\nHINT: Sort the calendar list by Start Date and do NOT copy/move these items back to the CALENDAR folder if they're stale/dead/defunct/moot.\n\nA: See Pierre-Yves 1 post: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23297197#23297197\nThis was driving me crazy. Sync between Outlook 2007 and my iphone was working perfectly on ios 6 - I primarily sync Calendar, contacts, and notes.\nThen everything went bizerk with ios 7... All of a sudden nothing was getting  syncronized, but rather multiple Calendars and Contacts showed up in Outlook 2007. Disabling Calendar, contacts, and Notes in my iphone's icloud settings did the trick. Now I have ONE Calendar and ONE contact list in Outlook, fully in sync with my iphone.\n\nA: Seems like a one way sync.\nIts not the first time iv heard of this issue popping up.\nYou can try to solutions by the users above. \nBut what I did was sync with a 3rd party Plug-in.\nIv been using EVO Collaborator for several different syncing needs so I was using this for iPhone standard as well. And it has no problems whatsoever.\nSo I suggest you try out EVO Collaborators free trial version and see if it helps :) \nBlogpost : http://outlookandmacosxserver.blogspot.com/2014/10/synchronize-iclouds-contacts-and.html\n", "Q: What is a good GTD app with cloud sync on iPhone, iPad, and Mac? I am looking for a good GTD (todo/task/project management) app that has cloud sync. I'd like it to be on my iPhone, iPad and Mac. Web app would be nice, too.\nOmniFocus is the closest thing I've found but it seems too expensive.\nThings don't have clound sync... only WiFi sync is available for Things.\nDo you know of any GTD app I'm looking for?\nThanks!\n\nA: Check Wunderlist by 6Wunderkinder: http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/\nIt's free. Iphone and ipad apps are available on itunes app store.\n\nA: I found a good, cheap alternative to OmniFocus in ToodleDo. It is browser-based (it doesn't get much more \"cloud\" than that), but they also have an iOS app for offline use. I've been using it for a few years now and have had little complaints even at their prices (free to a fraction of OmniFocus).\nAs a sidenote, OmniFocus does support cloud-based syncing. From the product page:\n\nSync\nYou can’t accomplish your goals if you\n  don’t have them with you. OmniFocus\n  synchronizes your task database with a\n  server or disk, so that all of your\n  Macs, your iPhone, and your iPod Touch\n  are up-to-date. Sync over your local\n  network using Bonjour, through the\n  cloud using MobileMe or any standard\n  WebDAV server, or even with something\n  as simple as a USB drive.\n\nI believe this is a recent development since their iOS apps. OmniGroup products are not cheap, but they are definitely worth the expense.\n\nA: *\n\n*Doit.im which has a web app + iPhone and Android apps. What sets Doit.im appart from e.g. toodledo and producteev is that it is more tailored towards GTD rather than generic task management (though inspired by GTD).\n\n*Dejumble is a Mac app which does cloud sync with its companion iPhone app.\nI have used both apps, but I am sticking with Omnifocus. Doit.im is free, and Dejumble is not. I have had some high CPU usage issues with Dejumble too.\nEdit: I would also say that Doit.im has more organizational features/attributes per task than wunderlist.\n\nA: I  use Things. Since version 2, it now has a Cloud synch option. I can enter or move items on my iPad and iPhone, as well as Macs running either 10.6.8 or 10.8.5. I haven't upgraded to Mavericks yet, so can't comment on how it works there.\n\nA: Check out Producteev - it's got a great iOS and Web app, and a Mac desktop app coming soon. It seems a bit more fully featured than Wunderlist as well. It's also got a recurring tasks feature, push notifications...\nThere website looks a bit cluttered, but the service does work pretty well.\n\nI've tried a bunch of different apps, and so far this is the most usable/reliable one I've found.\n\nA: Just learned about http://getflow.com the other day.

I don't just want to go like for like, does anyone know what the upper limits of the machine are?\nI have a 1TB USB drive plugged in, so I'm assuming the BOIS can cope with up to a TB which is fine. What I'm more interested in is restrictions on the SATA version and buffer size.\nI'm not well versed on the mechanics of a HDD, so forgive me if any of this sounds naive. I just want to get the most bang for my buck.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nRich\n\nA: As seen in Apple Discussions your iMac has the SATA2 controller.\nAlso there are no limitations from the controller for the cache size of the HDD. \nSo you may easily go for an 7200 SATA2 16MB/32MB cache\nnote: The last 17\" iMac, was the late 2006 model which I assume thats what you have :)\nedit: Even if your iMac is SATA 1, it wont have any compatibility problems.

Theoretically the accelerometers in an iPhone can be used to track distance using interpolation over time.\nWhat is the estimated error for tracking distances between 1 and 10 meters?\nIs there any iPhone app that work as a measuring tape?\n\nA: The accelerometer chips used in the iPhone have too much noise to be used for accurate distance integration over even short distances with simple movements.  Even if it were a quiet sensor and provided good data, Apple pre-filters the accelerometer in a way that prevents applications from performing a proper integration.\nThe filtering is useful to lower the terrible noise floor, and to make app developer's lives easier whether they want 1 update per second or 100, but it's irreversible and Apple doesn't provide a way to get the raw data, so any acceleration integration only produces delayed distance with significant overshoot.\nThis is, of course, on top of the normal problems of using an accelerometer to find distance (removing gravity - which the gyroscope makes much easier - for instance).\nMost of the pedometer apps use the accelerometer to count steps and use the GPS to measure distance over longer distances and to calibrate the user's individual step distance.  They do not calculate distance using the accelerometer.\n\nA: There are plenty of pedometer apps, so you might check their reviews. Also, in terms of accuracy, here's an answer at stackoverflow.\n... and another answer implementing a pedometer with around 20m accuracy.\n\nA: The accumulated error of time integration is too much to measure distance from accelerometers. Even for industrial seismographs, most of them can not practically measure distance, even if filtering is adopted.\n\nA: I wrote a blog post about it. Getting distance with accelerometer and other iPhone sensors without using GPS is definitely possible. Results aren't 100% accurate but usable.\nhttp://www.nomtek.com/scanning-rooms-with-an-iphone/\n\nA: From what I've heard, the iPhone accelerometer output is very noisy - most applications that utilize it for any sort of moderate precision work do a lot of filtering and output modification to smooth out the noise.\nAn iPhone can be placed flat on a table, and the accelerometer will still output a fair bit of data.  I imagine you could certainly use it to measure longer distances (>10m), but I probably wouldn't trust it for high resolution measurements.\n\nA: Did you want something like this?\nMagicPlan by Sensopia\nDepending on what you want to use that information for, couldn't hurt to reach out to the app developers.\n\nA: The problem isn't the precision of the accelerometer but its precision relative to the time of the measurement.\nIf you can move the phone from point A to point B in a fraction of a second, you should be able to get a very accurate measurement. If you take a minute or an hour for the same measurement, however, the accuracy will be near zero because of the noise.\n\nA: 12 years later, the technology in Phones has been enhanced such that measurements are more precise and reliable.\nThe app SizeUp - a smart tape measure - is one such tool I use.\nDisclaimer - I have no financial or other connection to the developer of SizeUp, My Size Israel 2014 Ltd.\n", "Q: Does constant charging harm my Macbook Pro? I usually connect my macbookpro with the charger 12-15hour/day and 7 days a week. I'm afraid the battery could lose capacity over time. However, I believe modern electronics should be able to handle this kind of scenario and automatically stop charging the battery once it's full. Does this apply to macbook pro? Or do I need to continue disconnecting it once its fully charged?\n(I'm not a native speaker, so please feel free to edit this question to clarify my words.)\n\nA: See http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html. This link suggests that you should fully discharge and recharge the battery at least once a month. I did not see this on that page, but I read somewhere that it is ok to leave a mac plugged in for an extended time, so just make sure you exercise the battery and let it completely discharge every once in a while.\n\nA: Anecdotal evidence (i.e. my own experience) suggests that it's not very harmful. I have a white MacBook 13\" from 2007 and my battery still manages a good 5 hours (it did around 6.5 when new). I leave it on the charger most of the time, but about once a month (sometimes twice, sometimes once in two months) when I take it with me, I just let it sleep when I deplete the battery. That way, it will completely drain. After that I always make sure to fully charge it.\n", "Q: What would I lose if I needed to reinstall from a Time Machine backup? Is there a list somewhere of the areas of the hard drive that aren't backed up by Time Machine? And does reinstalling from Time Machine install everything from the backup or just parts of it?\nI like to tweak things a lot, like customizing the system Apache server and installing stuff into /usr/local (Max Howell's Homebrew, for instance), so I'd like to double check what areas I might lose if I needed to reinstall from a Time Machine backup (whole disk image backups seem a bit overboard for my tastes).\n\nA: Things which they were not restored and they were crucial, was:\n\n\n*\n\n*MySQL Databases\n\n*VMWare Fusion virtual machines\n\n\nThe default backup exclusion list, can be found in:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\n\nDo not forget to check your excluding folders on the prefs as well ;)\n\nA: Time machine backups most things I (and others) have done an upgrade of the OS ie to a new disk from a TM backup. I have also done a restore after my hard disk died.\nTo see what it does not backup go to System Preferences -> Time Machine->Options. I forget the defaults but they include various caches - e.g. ~/Library/Caches. I have added ~/.Trash\nYou can also see what it has backed up by looking at /Volumes//Backups.backupdb//Latest\n\nA: I don't think that you'll end up loosing anything (except few temporary files). This is covered here:\n\n\n*\n\n*What can Time Machine back up, and where can it put it’s backups?\n\n*What should I exclude, and what should I not exclude?\nThe information is from the Podini Time Machine page (I highly recommend reading), which is one of the best collection of information about Time Machine on the web.\nI used Time Machine to upgrade my disk (backup, then boot off the installation dvd and restore a time machine backup on the new one) and did not loose /opt, /usr/local and other.\n\nA: You might loose lower level stuff in /usr/local when reinstalling using a Time Machine backup.\nI know from my own experience that Macports does not get restored (installed in /opt/local).\n", "Q: Automaticly and seamlessly sync iPhone photos as soon as they're taken (over the air) I use Snappy. That's my preferred photo app of all! So, please, keep this in mind.\nIdeally I want to be able to sync to picasa and dropbox. But I wouldn't mind if it was flickr, picposterous or whatever, as long as it's really automatic and seamless, unlike this guy's solution. I've tried many apps and couldn't find a single one (apparently unlike this guy, which is the reason why I started this question).\nDropbox app like few others do let you take photos from inside the app and submit the photo. But that's not even a seamless sync - if there's no internet connection the photo won't be sent as soon as internet becomes available unless the app stays open.\nMaybe a good solution would be just an app able to monitor the DCIM folder and send any new ones through e-mail as soon as it sees it. Then we could use pixelpipe, instapaper, sendtodropbox or anything! That way the iOS already handles sending e-mails exactly the way we expect - it will go through as soon as a connection is available.\nFor now, I'm using Picbox - it softens the whole manual process at least... But that's still not it!\n\nA: I too have tried to find something to do this, with little success.

Just recently I noticed my battery life having a pretty significant drop and the \"kernel_task\" process using quite a bit of CPU (a constant 1-6% on my 2.8ghz dual-core i7, 2010 MBP). Obviously I think the kernel_task's CPU usage is contributing to the battery drop and I need to find out why.\nSearching Google, it seems kernel_task is OS X's version of Windows's \"svchost.exe\" - the notorious do-everything process that you can't ever truly debug, you have to just manually flip switches until one of them works.\nIs there any way I can more easily get to the bottom of the out-of-control kernel_task activity? I haven't tried a reboot because if that does \"fix\" it, it doesn't really fix the underlying problem.\nActivity Monitor shows the CPU usage. When I hit Inspect, it shows 77 threads, 2 ports, hours and hours of CPU time, Context Switches going up about 400 per second, and Mach Messages In and Out both going up at about 6,000 per second.\nHow can I somehow inspect or monitor this kernel_task process and figure out what's actually using all this power?\n(note: my current suspects are the recent 10.6.7 update, Firefox update from 4 beta 10 to RC, or ScreenResX - these are all things I've done recently that I can think of)\n\nA: As mentioned by @Christopher, heat can cause the kernel_task CPU to spike. The reason is listed in this post “Fixing” kernel_task CPU Problems in MacOS Lion 10.7. Apparently when the CPU heats up the ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext will take up CPU cycles in an attempt to reduce actual CPU load.\nSo one solution is to cool down your Mac (e.g. fan) through an external fan or something like SMCFanControl.\nThe article give another solution which is to remove the sub-kext that triggers that behavior. Though I must admit I am personally not sure about how safe it is to turn that behavior off.\n\nA: Usually kernel_task is out-of-control when some other processes are overusing system calls or resources (memory or disk I/O events).\nWhen this happens, you can use fs_usage reporting utility which will show you system calls and page faults related to filesystem activity in real-time.\nSo run this command in Terminal:\nsudo fs_usage\n\nthen observe which processes are frequently doing some system calls and if you're not using them, consider closing/killing them.\nTo be more specific, please check the TIME INTERVAL column which gives you elapsed time spent in the system call. A W appearing after elapsed time indicates the process was scheduled out activity (in that case the elapsed time includes the wait time).\nSo in order to filter the processes which are using the most time interval in the system calls, run:\nsudo fs_usage | grep -v 0.0000\n\nwhich will show you in the last column the most hungry processes (in terms of kernel time). You may adjust number of zeros for precision (less zeros displayed, more time spent).\nFor more ideas, also check: How to investigate high kernel task memory usage?\n\nHere are the most common issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*VBoxHeadless: if you're using VMs (via vagrant), consider suspending them when not in use;\n\n*mtmd: it seems Time Machine backups your data every hour even when your backup drive is not connected (so called local snapshots), so try disabling it (sudo tmutil disablelocal);\n\n*wine: if you're running Windows apps, consider closing them when not in use;\n\n*Chrome: limit number of tabs opened at the same time (try OneTab and/or TGS) or kill some Extension processes (JavaScript) via Task Manager, since each tab could generate a separate process.\nCheck: Chrome addon to stop “Page(s) Unresponsive” message.\n\nA: I had a massive spike in kernel_task CPU usage, and it turned out that my CPU fan was partially unplugged. kernel_task has something to do with the throttling of the CPU when it gets too hot. In your case, maybe your fan is just gummed up with junk and dust and needs to be cleaned out.\n\nA: I had the same problem in Yosemite but thanks to this good soul based on this another good fellow I could solve it. I still can't understand what happened, but after losing a whole weekend trying to work it out I just gave up and blindly follow his instructions.

I tried one thing at a time and what solved it was... closing 5 or 6 windows in the Finder app. Can't say I understand why, but it was clearly that.\n\nA: On my Mac the CPU use of kernel_task is proportional to the internet bandwidth I use, ranging from about 0% to 50%. It's probably caused by the drivers for my Huawei 3G modem (HuaweiDataCardDriver.kext).\nYou could try disabling kernel extensions. There's no need to use kextunload: it's safe to just move the kext bundles from /System/Library/Extensions/ to some other folder and restart. You can use Consultant's Canary or kextstat | grep -v com.apple to list kernel extensions that didn't come with OS X.\n\nA: To troubleshoot out-of-control kernel_task specifically, here are some useful commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Profile entire system, focusing on the kernel process (PID: 0), run:\nsudo spindump 0 -reveal\n\nFor specific process (like launchd), use sample, e.g. sudo sample launchd or by PID.\n\n*To gather memory consumption by kernel task, use (sorted by dirty by default):\nsudo footprint 0\n\nNote: Use -a to target all the processes.\n\n*To gather system-wide diagnostic information from multiple utils, run: sudo sysdiagnose.\nThis can be also triggered by hitting Shift-Control-⌥-⌘-. (period).\nYou should see the screen flashed when started, then wait few minutes until the file is revealed in Finder.\nSee: How do you get system diagnostic files from OS X?\nThen uncompress and check the files such as footprint*.txt, spindump.txt, taskinfo.txt, bc_stats.txt and other.\n\n*Check vm.swapusage in kernel states, e.g. sysctl -a | grep ^vm.swapusage.\nBasically, more swap you use (check the swap files in /private/var/vm which are managed by dynamic_pager, see: man dynamic_pager), the more kernel struggling with the performance due to Swapins/Swapouts operations (see man vm_stat and man fs_usage). To test, run:\nvm_stat 1\nsudo fs_usage | grep -w kernel_task\n\nNote: Hit Control-C to stop.\n\nA: I had a similar question about how to identify files and programs connected to kernal_task using the following terminal command:\nkextstat -l -k | awk '{n = sprintf(\"%d\", $4); print n, $6}' | sort -n\n\nThis will display various kexts and the memory associated with them.  For example, 6184960 com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360 is a big hog for me, but I can't do much about it if I want to use wifi.\nOne of the suggestions I received was to look up all non-Apple kexts are taking up memory by piping the above to grep -v com.apple.  It's possible that some non-Apple programs are using up your resources.  You should be able to remove those without breaking anything.\nThe age old solution of course is to restart your computer.  Sometimes that's all it takes to set processes back to their normal levels of CPU usage.\n\nA: Here is a great explanation what a kernel_task is. It could be drivers (kexts), network or disk activity. You cannot simply use Instruments to attach to the kernel_task process.  \nLook for other signs, like logs (Console.app), disk activity (for example: iotop fs_usage), network activity (try disconnecting from local network, turning off devices in network preferences), try to uninstall/remove from memory (kextunload) drivers, which are from third party - tablets, usb 3g modems and etc. Check for applications, that are installing kexts\nAlso make sure that your file system is not corrupted, if you had any crashes recently - do a check.\n\nA: I solved this by using my MBP's factory power adapter instead of my wife's MBA's. It seems to charge just fine (albeit, slowly), but for whatever reason causes this kernel_task issue. I did not try it in the right ports (they were unavailable). Apologies if this solution is already here\n\nA: For me I had one process (Netbeans in this case, which was reading a file  like 20GB) and it would use like 80% cpu for netbeans, 20% cpu for kernel_task (very suspicious).  This caused my whole system to run like tar.\nAlso suspicious is that \"menumeters\" would report lots of \"sys\" time, per cpu.  You can see this in the \"top\" command as well, like CPU usage: 21.40% user, 23.74% sys\nLater, it might be netbeans 120% cpu, kernel_task 65%, but anyway they were both \"high cpu at the same time\"\nsudo fs_usage showed lots of this:\n12:46:34.446367  PAGE_IN_FILE      A=0x093a5bb000       0.000001   java.453214\n\nMy theory is that netbeans was \"reading so much\" that it was causing page faults to even run its own program (i.e. sending out to swap its own program), so getting a queue behind the page fault system.  And probably swapping \"other programs\" out to swap as well, causing the whole system to go sllow. \nUsing top, the FAULT column was increasing by 70K/sec, as well.\n\nA: My macbook Pro was almost unusable because of kernel_task high CPU for weeks\nAt the same time the battery get inflated so i finally decided to go on Apple Center in Rome to replace it... even if out of warranty Apple have replaced my battery (and keyboard as well) for 0€ cost.\nEven better ... kernel_task problem suddenly disappears !!!\nso i'm pretty sure that it was because of the battery , directly or indirectly\n", "Q: How to restore iTunes library from a backup My PC recently died, and I'm trying to transfer my iTunes library to my Mac. According to http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/moving-your-itunes-library-to-a-new-hard-drive, the iTunes database is keyed by filename, so even if I copy my old library and music files into the iTunes directory on my Mac, the database doesn't point to the right files anymore, because the directory structure is different on the Mac than on the PC. iTunes is able to partially recover by searching for matching files, but it still winds up with a lot of broken links - too many to repair by hand. Since the old computer is broken, I can't 'consolidate' the library in its old location before transferring it, as that website suggests. Do I have any options for restoring the library intact?\n\nA: Do you know someone who has a working PC around you ?\nCopy your files + iTunes database to this PC, launch iTunes and migrate your ratings to an id3 tag so you can restore them later. I explain the method in details here : http://tunecrux.com/resilient-id3-embedded-ratings\n\nA: You should be able to copy the backup of your iTunes library to the Mac, then tell iTunes to \"Add to Library\" and select the folder of your songs. \nAll the metadata, like the song's names and albums, should be recovered from the file's header, and the files will be moved to the normal iTunes library inside your home directory's Music folder.\n", "Q: Is there any AirPort product that supports to receive audio streaming and share a hard drive on USB?

Quote from wikipedia article:\n\nTo support display devices requiring higher video bandwidth, there is provision for a dual DVI link. A dual link doubles the number of TMDS pairs, effectively doubling video bandwidth at a given pixel clock frequency.\nDual link should not be confused with dual display (also called dual head), which describes those situations where a computer is hooked up to two monitors at once. Neither, either, or both of the dual displays could be dual link. Depending on the video card(s), the displays could be both analog (VGA), an analog and a digital, or both digital.\n\nIn order to attach two monitors, you could use a third party device like Matrox GXM (Graphics eXpansion Modules) - you can connect two or three monitors from your Display Port, however, there are some limitations (like the OS does not know natively that there are two or three monitors connected and treats it like one). The price is about $350 for the Tripplehead and around $220 for the Dualhead one.\nHere is the GXM homepage.\n", "Q: iPad in corporate environment Company portal has Windows authentication with SSO. \nBut iPad is not domain member, so ask password on every SSO company site. \nIs there a way to setup iPad for domain authentication ? \n\nA: No, it isn't possible.

I have read a lot about this online and would like to confirm once and for all.\nIs it possible to retrieve SMS messages that have been deleted from my iPhone?\nI know it is possible to get access to the sms.db file but that only holds the current SMS messages. I tried that and was successful in getting it off the phone but when checking the contents there were no deleted messages.\nAnd this would not be relying on any backups either, i.e. I backed up my phone, sent a message and then deleted it without backing up before deleting. Is that SMS gone for good?\n\nA: You could try to recover information from the sqlite file using for example a hex editor. Here is a quote from SQLite FAQ:\n\nI accidentally deleted some important information from my SQLite database. How can I recover it?\nIf you have a backup copy of your database file, recover the information from your backup.\nIf you do not have a backup, recovery is very difficult. You might be able to find partial string data in a binary dump of the raw database file. Recovering numeric data might also be possible given special tools, though to our knowledge no such tools exist. SQLite is sometimes compiled with the SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE option which overwrites all deleted content with zeros. If that is the case then recovery is clearly impossible. Recovery is also impossible if you have run VACUUM since the data was deleted. If SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE is not used and VACUUM has not been run, then some of the deleted content might still be in the database file, in areas marked for reuse. But, again, there exist no procedures or tools that we know of to help you recover that data.\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Creating and deploying a standard build of OS X 10.6 company-wide My company is growing quickly and we are purchasing a lot of iMacs.

Having ugly technical data filled upfront makes the user experience more laid back and minimizes the possibility of typoing wrong data.\n\nThe domain itself doesn't tell if it is a Google Apps domain or not. Yes, (any) mail software could try to retrieve the info through some channels, but that would lead to extra traffic. Also using your domain with Google Apps is rather marginal versus not using your own domain with Google Apps. \nFurthermore, it would be rather dubious if Apple tried to check every non-gmail.com domain if it is a Google Apps domain or not. Every query leaves a footprint.\n", "Q: how can I move multiple files at once? I'm really new to Macs, and finding file operations to be really frustrating after Linux. If I have a Finder window open with 5 files that I want to move to a different folder, I can select all 5 (shift-click for contiguous or command-click for non), but when I try to command-drag them to a new location, it deselects all but one.\nIs there any way to move more than one file at a time? Ideally I'd just like to select all the files, do a command-X to cut them from the current location, and then command-V to paste them in the new location, but Cut seems to not be allowed in the Finder (at least, command-X doesn't work, and Cut is greyed out in the Edit menu.) I don't want to have to copy them from my current location, paste them into the new location, and then go back and delete them from the original location.\nCan anyone help me? I'm sure this is very basic, but it's totally non-intuitive after coming from a different operating system and I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it.\n\nA: For moving files without dragging, Finder uses the \"Copy/Move\" metaphor instead of the \"Cut/Paste\" metaphor, and the relevant menu item is hidden so it's hard to discover on your own.\nTo move files in Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the source file(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the menus: Edit » Copy\n\n*Using the keyboard: ⌘C\n\n\n*Go to the destination folder.\n\n*Move the files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the menus: Click Edit and hold down ⌥. The Copy item becomes Move. Select that.\n\n*Using the keyboard: ⌥⌘V\n\nA: Your frustration with the Finder is a worldwide sport :) Finder does make things harder sometimes. \nFinder exhibits different behavior depending upon the context (both the source and destination) of your files. \nIf you drag files in the same \"Volume\" (or Drive), it will default to Move. \nIf you drag files to a different \"Volume\" (or Drive), it will default to Copy.\nHowever, this behavior can be inverted by pressing ⌥ while dragging. (That's option or alt in non-apple keyboards).\nSo for instance if you Drag a set of files to another folder in the same drive (say from your Documents to your Desktop), Finder will default to Move those files. If you intend to Copy, you have to press ⌥. This will change the cursor and a green \"+\" marble will appear, indicating that you will be making a copy.\nIf, on the other hand you insert a USB Key and want to Move files from there to your Desktop, Finder will default to Copy (when you drag), so you will have to override it by, again, pressing ⌥. This time the Green \"+\" Marble will disappear. \nIf you happen to have a two-button mouse, you can always drag with the right mouse button; upon release in the destination folder, a contextual menu will appear, asking you for an action (Copy or Move).\nFinder doesn't implement cut, so any \"move\" operation must be manually performed by using the mouse as I've just described. \nThere is, albeit for a small price, a very decent Finder \"plug-in\". I'm talking about Total Finder. It's not a bloated piece of software and has been decently stable since I got it. Among other features (like tabs!) it sports Cut and Paste:\n\nUse keyboard shortcuts to move files around. Faster than drag & drop.\n\nI do not work for BinaryAge but I do recommend TotalFinder to people who doesn't want to use a full finder replacement (like the excellent PathFinder), but still wants a few details.\nAll these pieces of software offer trial versions so you can \"see for yourself\". \nFinally, as already suggested, don't ⌘ and click to move or copy files or you will be effectively deselecting the last one. \nHope this helps you a little bit more. As a side note, there are some Finder alternatives or enhancements, some of these topics have been discussed here on Ask Different. \n\nA: You can do it fast and simple in terminal app! If you want copy all files in the current dir to another just type this:\ncp * <destination dir>\n\nOr if you want copy all files with folders:\ncp -r * <destination dir>\n\nAlso you can use the same way to move files, use this command:\nmv * <destination dir>\n\nWhere '*' is a wildcard for ALL files and folders in the current directory.\n\nA: Don't command-drag them, just drag them. Clicking on one of the selected files and holding the mouse down (left-click) and dragging to your new location will allow you to drag any combination of files to a new location.\nAlso cmd-x and cmd-v work fine on files on my leopard install\n\nA: If I'm copying everything in a folder, I just hit 'cmd a' to select all.\nIf I'm copying just some items in a folder, I can select the files discontiguously by command clicking, or command dragging. Once I've selected the files I want, I release the command key and mouse, then click on and drag the selected files to where I want them.\nThe effect of the command key is on SELECTION, not on MOVEMENT.\nIf I want to make a copy of the files in a different place, leaving the originals where they were, I hold down the option key before I release the mouse on the drag.\n", "Q: Can iTunes Genius (or song metadata) be improved so songs without a match can use the feature? My question boils down to: \"Technically, how does the Genius feature work?\" so that I may use it in instances where it fails to fine enough matches for a specific song.\nPart of this question is — what is stored in your library or meta-data on iTunes or on your iPhone that allows the songs to combine into auto-playlists? In other words, what is it delivering when it says \"Delivering your Genius results...\"\nMore than just academically interesting, I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to adjust the metadata of those songs that get the Genius error messages so that they work.  I have had a few lately that are popular songs and should have been able to find results easily but didn't.\n\nA: The way I understand it, Genius not only uses your mp3's metatags to organize Genius information, but also gets a lot of information from what people put in their playlists. This makes sense, as the point of Genius is to automatically put together a list of song that go together, without having to do it manually.\nI read an article about this once, where a guy had Genius create a playlist for him, and he couldn't figure out for the life of him what the songs had in common. They were from all different years, genres, etc., even including spoken word. Finally, he realized that the tracks all had one thing in common -- they were Canadian. Of course, this isn't the most intelligent behaviour as tracks that are Canadian are not necessarily those you would like to listen to in succession. But of course, it would not be uncommon for people to create a \"Canadian\" playlist for other reasons than listening to it as a collection, and that's why Genius thought they might go together. The Genius feature slowly loses its charm as the track progresses from Celine Dion to a CBC Radio archive to (heaven forbid) Justin Bieber.\n\nA: The Genius features checks your ID3 tags so if your metadata is all in order, standard and relatively accurate, you should get decent results. There is no for sure as Apple has not released how \"it\" works exactly but there is no \"Shazam\" type of computer analysis of track's structure.\nNow on a side note, Genius analyzes what other users had also bought (for the song that Genius is checking), what they're also listening to, and displays your Genius playlists and recommendations accordingly.\nBottom Line: Keep your ID3 tags in line and Genius should be able to locate your song as long as it's not something obscure.\n\nA: Apple's official description of the feature is tragicomically terse, iTunes itself gives zero detailed feedback on genius matching, but there are some round about ways to poke at the engines and see if changes to the better can be made.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Match will give you a feel for which songs do not instantly match as a side effect of turning the feature on. You initially will have a bulk summary of how many songs matched and which ones were not matched. It's a good bet Apple uses the same type of matching here (perhaps better than genius) - but it's a good start.\n\n*The genius data is not easily readable, so you can't easily make lists of songs that genius doesn't recognize and also songs it does know, but just can't find enough matches now in your library to make a mix.\n\n\nI have never seen the design documents for the genius feature, nor someone posting code that dumps the database where apple stores and syncs the genius data to your iTunes and iOS devices, so an authoritative answer might have to wait until code ends up in a museum, but three general aspects of iTunes matching have helped me pick at how things function:\n\n\n*\n\n*Many things go into matching songs - metadata, length, and most likely some fingerprinting of the file as well as an analysis of portions of the sound is likely processed to ensure a match is made of your seed song.\n\n*These identifying characteristics are uploaded and once the iTunes servers have processed these results, a database is prepared and downloaded to your device (computer iTunes or iOS device) so it can react locally to subsequent match requests.\n\n*Often a specific song will find matches in one library, but fail to find enough matches when it sits in a different iTunes library. The fact that the error message is the same, doesn't help figure out why a match failed.\n\n\nI have had some success looking for a song in the iTunes store (when that song is even sold there) and look at the recommended tracks. In practice this lets me judge if the song is known well enough to match in a large library or if iTunes just hasn't pegged that song yet (especially for songs that are not for sale through the Apple storefront as a digital download.)\nSince each music library can be wildly different in terms of metadata matching Apple's database and content, it's quite hard to generalize if things are getting better or worse over time. My coverage for genius sure seems to be improving steadily, but that's of little use to someone where genius fails on most songs they care about. It absolutely fails me on new tracks from independent artists and non-mainstream releases that are less than 10 months old.\nFor now, the process of improving metadata is a trial and error process for me. I hope someone can reverse engineer the database if Apple doesn't decide to add more details or expose more of the matching process, but I'm also not expecting either any time soon.\n", "Q: Mac Dictionary improvements I tend to use the dictionary a lot on the mac. Its annoying to launch the app everytime i need to lookup a word. Are there any other apps/hacks to avoid this annoyance? Spotlight lookup is awesome, but doesnt show enough detail. Do you know any app that can provide a panel view for dictionary definitions. For example, launch bar has a nice panel view for its calculator results. \n\nA: Try ^+⌘+D while selecting a word (that's ctrl+cmd+d). If the app is well integrated into Mac OS X, it will show a little popup with the word definition.\nLike so\n\nIf you click \"More..\", it'll open the dictionary app.\nIf this shortcut doesn't work, go to \nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard shortcuts > Services\nand search Look Up in Dictionary to add the shortcut you want.\n\nA: You can use Alfred which, with the define keyword (configurable), will give you several answers with the first line of the definition. It's as fast as Spotlight (I replaced Spotlight by Alfred) and is much more convenient, complete and easy to use. I'm just delighted. I now use the dictionary a lot while I didn't before for the same reason you're giving.\nHere's an example:\n\n\nA: \n\"Can i have a dictionary panel instead\n  of launching the whole app?\"\n\nIn Dictionary.app, open the Preferences panel and change the Contextual menu setting from Opens Dictionary application to Opens Dictionary panel:\n\nThis will open up the small panel which stays within the same application (like Loic Wolff showed in the image).\n", "Q: How to allow a group to access a folder? I want to allow the _www group to write to a folder.\nI clicked on the folder to go to the \"Get Info\".\nAt the bottom there is a \"Sharing & Permissions\" section with a \"+\" to add users. However it does not show any of the system groups such as _www.\nIs there a way to enable showing hidden users and group in the GUI?\nOr do I have to do it via command-line instead?\nIt seems the GUI allows to set permissions for several users and group, which I like, while the command I believe only allow 1 owner and 1 group? \n\nA: Apple hides anything it considers a \"system\" user or group from the GUI.  There's probably some way to disable that, but I generally use the command line for system-related stuff.\nThe command line version comes in two flavors:  there is a basic permissions structure with a single owner, a singe group, and everyone else, then there are POSIX ACLs.   Interestingly, Apple took the route of modifying chmod to support ACLs instead of shipping the standard getfacl and setfacl tools.\n$ sudo chmod +a 'group:_www allow add_file,add_subdirectory,list,search,delete_child' /webroot\n\nYou may also want the file_inherit and directory_inherit permissions to apply the ACL to created files/directories.  See chmod(1) for more details.\nThe -a option to chmod removes ACL entries.\n", "Q: Stored password in Safari Versus Firefox Is there a way to retrieve password stored in Safari as it is possible to do it in Firefox ?\n\nA: Safari stores its passwords in the OSX Keychain.  Open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app, select the \"Login\" keychain (this should be default) and select \"Passwords\" under \"Category\".  Doubleclick an entry and check \"Show password\"; you'll be asked for your login keychain password (this is usually the same as your account password).\n(For a while I was using an add-on for Firefox that used the Keychain, but it was highly broken.)\n\nA: Another solution is the Safari extension LastPass [see lastpass.com].  This is also a Firefox addon.  You could migrate your passwords and secure notes to LastPass and they would be available on any browser and on any machine.  This extension was scrutinized by a security expert on the podcast \"Security Now\" episode #256 [show transcript at http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-256.htm]\n\nA: Actually they are available more conveniently in Safari itself:\nPreferences... -> Passwords\n", "Q: Dialing numbers from Contacts on iPhone when using a calling card or callback service I've got a long distance calling plan where I call a number and get a busy signal. The service then immediately calls me back, and when I answer, I'm presented with a dial-tone at which point I can call any number I want, with really cheap rates, while only getting dinged for local incoming minutes on my iPhone.\nThe problem with this is that I can't find a way to access and \"dial\" numbers from my Contacts when I'm presented with the dial-tone. I essentially have to have the number memorized or written down beforehand.\nWhen given the dial tone, I can access all my contacts, but there doesn't seem to be a way to generate the keypress tones from them.\nIs this possible on the iPhone? Maybe some other app that I can launch after answering the call which will access numbers in Contacts and generate keypress tones?\n\nA: Could you try accepting the incoming call, then starting a conference call where you dial the 3rd party? The dialing might make noises that the calling card service can hear, then you disconnect from the 3rd party before it connects and bills you.\n\nA: The only solution I could find for this is using the speakers and some program like the 1 buck MagicDial, that can translate the phonebook into DTMF dial tones and is actually made to do it so to another phones'es speakers.\nLastly, an idea would be changing service. There are calling cards that you call a local number - then you could use pause to dial the number in sequence. Or using VOIP directly from the phone, which is conceptually cheaper than calling cards since it doesn't require your side to have a call center.\n", "Q: Can I play audio out to both USB and Bluetooth on a MacPro simultaneously? I'm running Snow Leopard on a Mac Pro- audio preferences seem to limit audio output to only one port at a time. Is there a way around this? Also the Bluetooth output from the Mac is really weak, is there any way to increase it or make it more effective?\n\nA: Concerning the audio devides: try this and if it fails try this.\n\nA: You can use JackOSX it's a powerful and easy app from unix world that allow you to dispatch any input/output into any input/output\n", "Q: iPod touch 4th Gen stopped working with iHome iP90 I have an iPod touch 4th generation that I had been using with my iHome iP90 until today.  All of a sudden today I get a message saying that \"This accessory is not supported\"  Then when I remove my touch the sound no longer works.  When I reboot my sound returns.  Any ideas?  Really confused because all was fine until today.\n\nA: I stuck it in another older IP90 and it worked fine. So then I blew it and the IP90 out with compressed air and now it works. I'm not convinced it was the air though, we will see if it returns. Thanks.\n", "Q: Pandora app icon missing on Verizon iPhone 4 I am trying to help my friend get his Pandora app back on his iPhone, I don't use iPhones (Android guy) so I have no clue how to add the app back to his home screen, I have searched everywhere. I reset settings and made sure there were no restrictions set. I can search the iPhone and launch Pandora that way. I don't know how to uninstall it since I think you need an icon for that. \nAny way I can get the icon back so he can just press it and launch Pandora?\n\nA: Are you absolutely certain it's not there? There are a few reasons why you might not be seeing it, only one of which is due to the icon actually not being visible.\n\n\n*\n\n*The obvious one, you're simply overlooking it in an obvious place. Unlikely I know.\n\n*The almost as obvious one, it's in a folder and you haven't looked inside the folder. Also unlikely, but less so.\n\n*There are so many apps installed that it doesn't fit on the 11 Springboard pages. This is the most likely, because you can have as many apps installed as you want (flash memory permitting) and they'll always be available via Spotlight search, but you can still only display 180 icons. If you use folders then each folder can contain 12 (or 16?) icons, but if you've hit that 180 icon maximum (11 pages x 16 icons + 4 icons in the permanent bottom row) then additional apps simply won't appear.\nIf the problem is that there are too many apps, put some in folders (or delete some apps) and then sync with iTunes and the rest will reappear. Alternately you can use the iTunes app organizer to rearrange things; in that organizer you can see all of the pages of apps past page 11, which are kind of grayed-out so you know they won't actually appear on the device.\nEven if you don't have 11 pages of apps, try the iTunes app organizer anyway and see if you can find the app icon then, and try moving it to a more conspicuous place.\n", "Q: Can I install 16GB RAM on quad-core MacBook Pro? I'm planning to buy a new MacBook Pro with quad-core. And I want to install 16GB on it. But there is only 8GB options on Apple's website. Is this possible?\n\nA: Yes. Currently $180 from NewEgg.\nI just installed a Corsair 16GB matched pair (2x8GB 1333MHz DDR3 CL9) on an Early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro (i7 2.7GHz).

Perhaps you are thinking of the desktop i7 which has 3 or 6 slots, for a maximum of 12 or 24 GB.  I checked newegg, there aren't 8 GB DDR-3 SO DIMMs.\n\nA: According to Apple the answer is no, but OWC has tested it and found that there are no issues putting 16GB (2x8GB) in the latest generation MacBook Pro. The upgrade doesn't come cheap, though - at this time 2x8GB modules will set you back $1599.\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/1333DDR3S16P/\n\nA: Newegg.com lists 8GB sticks. You could buy two and get a 16GB setup.  \n", "Q: Is there an Automator action to create Keynote presentation from text file? I need to import a text file (consisting of subtitles) into a Keynote presentation. I need to turn each subtitle into a single slide, interspersed with blank (black) slides. I'd like to create an Automator action in order to do this.\nI think the way to do this is to filter paragraphs ending in two line breaks, but I don't know how to do it.\n\nA: Importing text into multiple Keynote slides directly\nI finally found out how you can import text paragraphs directly into multiple Keynote slides. Here's a quick proof of concept that works with iWork '08 Keynote at least:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keynote, select Black template or use your own subtitling template (the title component is what will hold the text on each slide)\n\n*Select View > Outline to show the presentation outline on the left\n\n*Click on the small icon of the first screen in the outline list\n\n*Paste in text -- each paragraph will go into the title of a new slide\n\n*\n\n*Note that the selected slide's title will be replaced with the first pasted paragraph\n\n*All formatting (e.g. italics) seem to be lost at this stage, unfortunately\n\n\n*Select all slides in the outline list (cmd+A)\n\n*Select Format > Reapply master to slide to fix the font and text color of pasted text to the ones defined in the template\n\n\nYou can also use Edit > Paste and match style when pasting in text to avoid the last steps of fixing the font and color.\nSo Keynote does have some basic import text into multiple slides functionality.\nTo preserve the formatting (italics etc) you can still go the paste into Powerpoint, save and open PPT into Keynote route.\nOriginal response: Subtitling with slideware works OK\nI have done movie subtitling before with Powerpoint. Something similar probably will work with Keynote or you can use Powerpoint and import that into Keynote for better visual quality.\nBy experimenting I found out that importing RTF files into Powerpoint mapped each paragraph to one slide. All italics and formatting was preserved, too.\nThus I made a RTF files out of the subtitle text documents (using some editor that allowed finding and replacing paragraph marks etc) and imported the RTF into Powerpoint that had a template with just a few white lines of text at the bottom of the screen.\nBefore anyone asks: This can be really useful for movies that are only shown once or twice at a festival: Show the text somewhere using a video projector and someone times the subtitle slides by hand. Cheap and works well.\nOther notes: \n\n\n*\n\n*I found that adding the blank slide between each subtitle text slide really helped (i.e. two paragraph marks between subtitles): \n\n*\n\n*To advance to the next text, quickly press -> -> producing a slight flicker that made people notice the text change.\n\n*Hide text for a while? -> ... wait and -> to show the next text item. Very flexible. \n\n\n*If you show the text over the movie image, you want to make a mask (think cardboard and duct tape ;-) for the video projector so that the edges of the video projector display area will be blurred -- otherwise they will be visible.\n\n*I would guess that some work by hand will be necessary to make the best results, as the source material is never uniform enough to automate completely.\n\n\nMac note: If you want to automate things that are not covered by Automator workflows, you can automate almost anything on a Mac with QuicKeys or other macro tools, even UNIX shell scripts or perl and the \"osascript\" command to integrate with AppleScript and GUI Applications...\nPlease let us know what solution you find that works with Keynote. Thanks.\nMicrosoft Office HOWTO (Added later)\nI just tried this again with Mac Office 2004's Word and Powerpoint. Seemed to work OK still. Probably works with all Office versions.\nWhat I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wrote some paragraphs of text in Word.\n\n*Saved the document as RTF (File > Save as > Format: RTF)\n\n*In Powerpoint, selected File > Open > the RTF text file. Sorry, earlier I remembered that I used some import command, it was open instead.\n\n*Powerpoint asked me if I wanted to open it with Powerpoint or Word, chose Powerpoint\n\n*The text was placed on multiple slides, one paragraph on each slide in as the slide title\n\n*Save in Powerpoint and open the PPT file in Keynote, should import OK\n\n*If you use suitable format for the slide(s) or suitable slide masters (white bold text on black and positioning) it should be good to go...\n\n\nI think this process is pretty simple and could be automated with e.g. QuicKeys or AppleScript.\n", "Q: Forcing bluetooth for iPhone incoming calls Is there anyway to force the iPhone to always use Bluetooth for incoming calls? - I'm on a motorcycle and have my iPhone set to auto answer calls, problem is it answers with the built in iPhone headphone/microphone instead of the paired and connected bluetooth headset.\nI also cannot answer with the button on the bluetooth headset as it is inside my helmet.\nAny ideas? - My iPhone is jailbroken if that helps.\n\nA: There's no way to do this via the iPhone itself, but there are voice-controlled Bluetooth headsets (such as the BlueAnt Q2) that would allow you to take the call on the headset without pushing a button.\n\nA: Don't know if you still want a solution for this, but Cardo makes in-helmet bluetooth receivers that are awesome. The send/receive button is on the outside of the helmet then you install the mic/speaker inside (simple process).\n\nA: You can set the phone to use the headset or speaker by default under the accessibility options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*General\n\n*Accessibility\n\n*Scroll down to interaction section\n\n*Call Audio Routing\n\n*Choose headset\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Bring \"Bluetooth headset with multiple pairing version\",\n\n*Iphone's sim insert in to other mobile like \"Nokia\" etc.,\n\n*Now set call divert \"if not answered\" with 20 to 30 seconds mode,\n\n*Then replace your sim in to iphone.\n\n*Now Pair Bluetooth with Nokia & Iphone also,\n\n*While riding bike if you get any call on Iphone, call will be ringing for your particular time & then divert to Nokia which have already auto call answer mode is enable, that's it ! \n\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS always rebooting when logging on to cellular network I upgraded to 4.3, without jailbreak. Phone seemed ok, but I turned it off and on again a few days later (normal power off). It started rebooting itself. I tried hard resets. \nEventually got to a stage where it needed the SIM unlock code but was otherwise working. Unlocking the SIM froze the device when the signal bars first showed (trying to register on the network, I guess). I tried resetting the network settings, no help.\nI did a complete restore this morning, setup as new device, activated (officially unlocked). Still the same problem. Someone at work connected it to XCode on Mac, said they didn't really do anything, and it started working. I turned it off, on again, and it has the same problem.

However, if one of our employees installs Remote Desktop 3 themselves onto their machine on the network via the App Store, how I can prevent them also accessing all the machines on our network?  \nOr will I have to disable admin access to everyone's machines other than mine on the network?  \n\nA: How are they supposed to know the login credentials for the other machines? And if they do know the credentials, they could probably do whatever they want with ssh, vnc, afp, etc… anyway, so no need to prohibit ARD, really.\nTo make it more precise: if you cannot trust your users not to spy on each other, don´t let them know each others passwords!\n", "Q: Is there a way to see all iPhone App Store purchases? I'm wondering whether there is a way to see all iPhone App Store purchases in a similar fashion that is available on Mac App Store in Purchased section.\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to view just iPhone App purchases.\nYou can view your whole iTunes purchase history. You can see your iPhone app purchases there.\nOpen iTunes -> Store menu -> View My Account -> Sign in -> Go to Purchase History\nUpdate: This seem to include all your purchases using your Apple ID (iOS App Store, Mac App Store, and iTunes Store)\n\nA: This is now possible since iOS 4.3.3 by going into the iPhone App Store > Updates > Purchased.  It provides a list of your iPhone app purchases and allows redownloading from the iCloud.\nAlso you can visit reportaproblem.apple.com and all recent purchases will be shown.\n\nA: On iOS, go to Settings > [your name] > iTunes & App Store.\n\nA: Not true...\nNone of these links are possible, nor if they when they do seem to be relevant show history of purchases. I do have doubts that Apple Store have charged me few times for an application I have paid for over and over again. So when it comes to check what have purchased there is no way possible, except on the phone and they are not in logical order, which makes hard to pinpoint which have I bought recently that I have gotten charged for it few times. Sometimes it shows that I have purchased something but the some don't show I have paid for them, although I did already. Surprisingly enough sometimes an application will show a price on it, I will install and it will say that I paid for it before, but other times more often it doesn't say that, and it makes me pay for it few times. Now I have been trying to look up the history purchase and no where in hell is it clearly apparent that I can achieve that mission. \n", "Q: Connect to Server as guest from command line I have a SAMBA share I mount on my Mac from time to time.

On the authentication dialog I choose to Connect Guest, and finally my remote share is mounted in /Volumes/<share_name>. This is great.\nCan I achieve all of the above with a single command in Terminal? I tried some variations of the advice provided here, but there are two things missing:\n\n\n*\n\n*how do I instruct mount to connect as guest?\n\n*how do I create the /Volumes/<share_name> directory on the fly, (so it doesn't have to exist before hand)?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: In order to mount as \"guest\", you need to use another command: mount_smbfs\nmount_smbfs -N //guest@server/share /some/existing/path\n\nThe \"-N\" is \"don't ask for password\" (type man mount_smbfs for more info).\nAs for the second part of how to create it on the fly (the path), I believe that it's not possible.

Yesterday I did just that.\nI cut the videos and pasted on the D: drive. It ran out of space so I freed up some space and did cut and paste again. The result was 15 corrupted files and no files on the iphone.\nI did this millions of times and it was always ok.\nI've looked for recovering software but none seem to recognize the iphone.\nI went to an apple store and the dude obviously told me that the proper way to backup files is using itunes. He also mentioned that \"there are some products out there that could do that for you. You should google it\". \nDoes anyone know an app that can recover deleted files from an Iphone?\n\nA: Deleted files? No. He's probably talking about things like Music Rescue, but they dont recover deleted files unfortunately, just take them off the phone without using iTunes. \nYour method of moving photos and movies is fine as you are only accessing the \"camera\" section of the iPhone's storage, and it is one of the methods that are supported.\nI think while you moved files around your cache may have filled up or something happened to the copy paste while they were cut, unfortunately cut is a destroying action, and if you cant ctrl-z immediately, I would assume it's game over.\n", "Q: How can I make preferences boxes open in correct display with SecondBar? I've just started using SecondBar to provide a menubar for applications that I display in an external monitor. It's a big help, except for one thing: dialog boxes (like Apple Menu -> System Preferences, or Firefox's add-ins) open in the main display.\nIs there any way to make dialog boxes open in whichever display the menubar was clicked from? So that if I use the main Mac menu bar for apps in my main display, the dialog opens in the main display, and if I use the SecondBar menu in my external display the dialog opens in the external display?\n\nA: I'm not familiar with how SecondBar works, but it looks like it's just a hack that duplicates the menubar on an external monitor. There's no operating system support for a second menubar so no support for determining which menubar was clicked and which monitor to open the dialog in.\nPerhaps the developer of SecondBar could somehow intercept the command and redirect the dialog, but I really doubt this low-level jiggery-pokery is possible.\n", "Q: How do I block SMSs on an iPhone? A few months ago, I made a deal with the devil the worst and most obnoxious telecommunication company ever to get an iPhone, and I actually would not regret it if they did not bother me sending me spam SMSs when I am at work. This is so annoying and disturbing I would actually leave the phone at home, but I need it so my girlfriend who is pregnant can communicate with me. Here in Peru there is no such thing as regulation in the telecommunications market, so I actually cannot complain about being sent spam.\nI am desperately in need of a mechanism (preferably one that does not require me to jailbreak my phone) to block SMSs from unapproved senders (or, at least, blacklisted senders). Unfortunately, the iPhone comes with no such functionality, and I have not found an app that does that (although I must admit I have not searched thoroughly). I would really pay money (up to, say, $5) for such an app. Does anybody know how to block SMSs from certain senders in an iPhone?\n\nA: You can't do it natively, and you can't do it through an App Store app.\nYou'll have to jailbreak and search for a blacklist app on Cydia.\nOf course you can disable SMS and/or MMS entirely on the device, but the iPhone and iOS is designed to have blocking enforced from the cell carrier and not the device. Until and unless your local carrier offers an iOS app so that you can self-block addresses, you'll need to modify iOS by jailbreaking to have SMS suppressed once they reach the iPhone hardware and software.\n\nA: You could use Google Voice to do what you're asking, but I guess they won't forward a number to Peru yet. Perhaps some kind of GV hack…\nJailbreaking is safe when you read the directions carefully and don't do anything rash (example: accepting iOS 4.3.1 from iTunes).\nUse the iClarified jailbreak / unlock wizard to determine what you need to do for your phone, then follow their tutorials carefully. http://iclarified.com/tutorials/iphone/\n", "Q: Simple encryption software for the Mac I am looking for an application which would allow me to encrypt either a file or a folder.

System Preferences>Accounts> - (delete home folder and all contents). \nIf the issue persists, it should be related to hardware and not software.\nHope that helps! \n\nA: I had a similar issue, the problem was that the battery had expanded and was applying pressure to the trackpad chip.\nWhen the battery was removed it worked fine.\nTry taking it out and see if it fixes it. If so then you need a new battery. :)\n\nA: That definitely sounds like a hardware issue. Can you get to an Apple Store? Then, at least, you'll be without the machine for a few days instead of a few weeks.\n", "Q: Can't gain write access to secondary hard drive root-level folder I have a second hard drive installed on my Mac. On its several root-level folders there's only one I can't get write access to.\nI've tried right-clicking it, select \"Get Info\", unlock it, click the plus sign, select my name, change my name, & everyone to \"Read only to \"Read & Write\", click the gear icon, \"Make Me the owner\" & \"Apply to enclosed items.\" \nEven after repeating those steps I still can't rename or delete this folder. How can I gain write access to it? \n\nA: Do you need permissions to exist on this volume?  If not use the \"Ignore permissions on this volume\" checkbox, and that will take care of all of the problems.\nAlso - I would run disk utility's verify to see if there are any problems with it.\n", "Q: Is there a good Hotmail client for Mac OS X? I have had an Hotmail account since 1997 (i.e. don't ask me to switch - have hundreds of filters and folders and thousands of contacts) and I recently switched to a Mac and I am looking for a Mac client that would deliver the same functionality as Windows Live Mail did in my PC. Also, don't ask me to forward/import to Gmail. I have tried that numerous times - Gmail fails at importing filter rules or nested folders properly from Hotmail and it also has numerous issues with sync and contacts etc when importing from Hotmail.\nThe Mail.app only supports POP3 for Hotmail which I hate because it is only local sync - I am looking for either IMAP/DeltaSync/Exchange (i.e. 2-way sync) for my Hotmail to work in Mac. I tried Postbox/Sparrow Lite/Outlook in Mac Office 2011/Thunderbird with webmail plugin/Eudora and none worked. I tried mBox for Mac and it worked great for about 2 weeks and now it stopped working with the new Lion Mail.app update. In anycase, mBox has been out of development since 2009. I looked at IzyMail but I am not willing to pay a subscription - I don't mind paying a one time fee though.\nHotmail used Exchange ActiveSync which works well on my iPhone. Mac's Mail program works with many Exchange servers, so I am really confused why Mac Mail cannot ActiveSync with my Hotmail account which apparently supports Exchange.\nI just want a mail client that truly syncs with Hotmail. Information to a POP3 clients flows one way so the Mac cannot update the server with read status, reply status and more.\nI am willing to pay for a solution and I just can't find such a software! I am also willing to pay a one-time fee for an IMAP gateway too and I can't find any such thing either.\nIs it really that hard to get Hotmail working in Mac?\n\nA: Hotmail doesn't have IMAP/Exchange support, it has Exchange ActiveSync support, but only for mobile devices. Everything on the Mac side, even MS's own Outlook 2011, uses POP3 to connect to Hotmail.\nYou could file a support ticket with the Mbox folks, and hopefully they'll have a timetable for updating their product to work with the new version of Mail.app.\n\nA: The basis of your question rests on the fact that you're not willing to relinquish your hotmail account. Of course, this may be reasonable because, amongst other reasons, all of your contacts have the email address, you're comfortable with how it works, etc. \nThere are currently no OS X DeltaSync-based clients, however you could consider building a solution based on jdeltasync. \nGiven that you're willing to pay to retain your Mac and stay with Hotmail, a different solution which will let you keep your Mac yet give you access to hotmail syncing is a virtualisation product (for example VMWare, Parallels, CodeWeaver) and use an appropriate windows client. The level of integration they offer is pretty good.\nLooking to the future, you may want to consider purchasing your own domain name and use it with a suitable mail service (for example, hosted Exchange) and slowly migrating your contacts to your new address. This will ultimately give you more control over your own needs instead of relying on others to provide support for a particular protocol.\n\nA: No - not even Outlook 2011 will DeltaSync with hotmail. You'll have to run a windows client in emulation or host a proxy server to translate DeltaSync to POP3/exchange/imap.\nThis is more a business problem and therefore a social problem than a technical problem.\nI am not a lawyer - but it's likely against the terms of service to provide a paid service like you ask to truly integrate a gateway into Windows Live with ActiveSync (or DeltaSync). I recall that for a while, you could simply set up Apple Mail to point to m.hotmail.com and it would work so it's pretty clear that measures are actively taken to prevent non approved clients from speaking with hotmail using sync.\nMicrosoft is on the record that their live sync technology is a competitive advantage and they are only offering it presently to people that pay for either Windows or to license ActiveSync. I would expect their licensing fees they would seek to allow a non MS client to benefit from their hard work is high enough to prevent this from happening.\nNumerous discussion postings are asking for and aknowledging that Outlook for Mac in Office 2011 does not sync with hotmail / windows live servers.\nHopefully this will help you decide to keep using mail that doesn't do what you want or help decide to invest the time to learning how to preserve access to hotmail but forward / send using IMAP and another service. It's not ideal since it's now two accounts to remember, set up, but it's not against the terms for now and less likely to be broken by Microsoft if they catch you forwarding your mail or accessing it from elsewhere using POP.\n\nA: Firstly some solutions (some named previously) -\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to Gmail: This is your best long term solution. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and Mac OS X 10.7 Lion properly supports Gmail/Google Calendar/Google Contacts.\n\n*Use mBox Mail (with any Mac e-mail app that supports IMAP): It's been updated to support 10.6 Snow Leopard and comments above says 10.7 Lion too. It was lasted updated in August 2011. This won't sync calendar/contacts just e-mail/e-mail subfolders. It is only a one off fee of $19.99 USD.\n\n*Use IzyMail (with any Mac e-mail app that supports IMAP): I believe this works in a similar way to mBox Mail, by way of a web proxy to the companies own IMAP server. This also won't sync calendar/contacts just e-mail/e-mail subfolders. The website looks dodgy to me but it is only $18 USD a year.\n\n*Use Hotmail.com (or Gmail.com) and forget the idea of using a desktop client. This wouldn't suit me but it does many people.\n\n*Use Windows. I know hardly a solution but Outlook 2003-2010 (after you've installed the Hotmail Connector add-on) and the free Windows Live Mail fully support Hotmail's DeltaSync. Which is ultimately what you need to get what you're after.\nEven using mBox Mail/IzyMail you still won't have your Calendars and Contacts synchronised. Hotmail doesn't support CalDAV which is the universal calendar equivalent of IMAP, meaning no Mac OS X software is able to talk to Hotmail's calendar and you can forget contacts sync.\nAll the other options mentioned by others above look very complicated, certainly more so than switching mail accounts (assuming mBox Mail and IzyMail fail).\nMigrating from Hotmail to Gmail is much easier than you think.\nOthers have said you can setup Gmail so you can \"Send As\" your old e-mail address and you can set Gmail to download all Hotmail's e-mail.\nThis is a pain though (especially if you've got subfolders). If you can get hold of a Windows PC temporarily there is a MUCH easier way. Open Outlook or Windows Live Mail and add Hotmail, also add Gmail using IMAP.\nIt's then a simple case of dragging and dropping the Inbox and Sent Items contents from one to the other, then dragging each subfolder from one to the other.\nThis also works when migrating from any IMAP compatible e-mail provider to another IMAP compatible e-mail provider.\nFinally Google has equivalent filtering rules, you'll only need to set them up once.\nI also suggest you read \"Comparison with Google Sync\" below.\n\nNow to debunk some inaccuracies stated above :-) -\nHotmail supports Exchange ActiveSync for mobiles and DeltaSync for desktops. It also supports POP3 for mobiles or desktops (the only non-propitiatory format it does support). \nFor all those people who think Exchange support also means Exchange ActiveSync. It doesn't! EAS is an extension of Exchange, it is not Exchange!\nIt won't work in Outlook for Windows, Outlook for Mac or Apple Mail, all of which support Exchange but do not support EAS. If it used to work by entering the Hotmail EAS server details into an Exchange compatible client it's more by luck. It's unlikely to be Microsoft stopping you, the technology isn't designed to work that way.\nYou'd think they could make EAS work on desktops too but literally no desktop client has ever supported EAS (Mac or Windows), there's got to be some reason why that's the case. It could be a technical one or it could be Microsoft doesn't want you using a mobile technology on desktops. We'll never know.\nMicrosoft are on record as saying IMAP is an old technology and DeltaSync is much better. This is true. It's able to synchronise e-mail, contacts, calendar, tasks and I think notes. It's also much more efficient than IMAP at handling e-mail.\nMicrosoft's technical reasons for creating a new technology are sound but lets face it the real reason is to stay propitiatory. If you recall it used to be the case that Hotmail didn't support Exchange ActiveSync or POP3. You could only access Hotmail at hotmail.com.\nMicrosoft aren't going to support IMAP, it's not going to happen.\nThe trouble is Exchange, Exchange ActiveSync and DeltaSync are propitiatory which require a licence. Apple licensed Exchange and Exchange ActiveSync from Microsoft. There's no reason why Apple couldn't licence DeltaSync (that I know of).\nI doubt they will though, to the best of my knowledge only Hotmail uses it and it's clear Apple would prefer you use MobileMe or Gmail. The blame here rests as much with Apple as Microsoft.\nExchange brings in potential big business support and EAS is the universal mobile standard for e-mail/calendar/contacts sync. DeltaSync just gives Apple Hotmail.\nComparison with Google Sync -\nGoogle Sync supports EAS, POP3, IMAP and CalDAV. Using the latter two methods you can get proper e-mail sync and calendar sync. Outlook or Windows Live Hotmail don't support CalDAV but Apple iCal, Mozilla Thunderbird (with Lightening calendar add-on) and Mozilla Sunbird do.\nTo my knowledge there's no way to get contact sync except the business Google Apps.\nApple have added their own Google Sync into Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (I think 10.6 not 10.5) and further enhanced it with Mac OS X 10.8 Lion. They do this using IMAP for Gmail, CalDAV for Google Calendar and I don't know how Google Contacts works but something similar.\nMicrosoft haven't added zilch Google Sync support to Windows (why would they?). You can use Mozilla Thunderbird (with Lightening calendar add-on) and Mozilla Sunbird though or if you prefer using Outlook there are plenty of third party Google Sync tools.\nI use GSyncit to synchronise Google Calendar/Google Contacts which works brilliantly and obviously Outlook natively supports IMAP.\nThe best you can expect with Google Sync and Windows Live Mail is Gmail IMAP, no Google Calendar Sync or Google Contacts Sync.\n\nA: Try using winebottler and wrap it over Windows Live Mail. A few winetricks may be required, but it's worth a try. If you have a windows pc, use the web installer and take the .msi file for windows live mail. Otherwise, download it from here.\n\nA: Try with mBox Mail for Mac; it will sync your Hotmail with any Mail client on a Mac. I just set it up on Outlook for Mac, and all my Hotmail folders are visible.\n\nA: On Sep 11 2013, Microsoft released full IMAP support for Outlook: http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/09/12/outlook-com-now-with-imap.aspx\n\nA: Pipe your hotmail through a Gmail account, either by forwarding everything from Hotmail to Gmail or by setting Gmail to download your Hotmail using POP.\nConfigure your Gmail to send using your Hotmail credentials.\nThen access your Gmail in Mail.app via IMAP.\n\nA: There is one supposed way to do it with FreePoPs with Mail, but unfortunately syncing the way you mentioned is not available. \nIf you want syncing, take the pain, move to gmail. Its better in every conceivable way. It can even send emails as your Hotmail account if you are married to the address.\n\nA: Similar to the gmail solution, you could use Fastmail. I've been using this setup for the same reasons as you (main address is hotmail since 1999, OSX, want IMAP) for a few years now. \nIt has two advantages over gmail:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can forward your hotmail to your fastmail account. (Gmail only allows periodic POPing). Edit (October 2011): It appears that since very recently  forwarding from hotmail to any other domain is now free. So the trick below is not so relevant any more. The trick why this works is because if you have a fastmail account or alias (one account allows multiple alias addresses), say examplealias@fastmail.com, you also have automatically a number of other addresses, including anything@examplealias.fastmail.com. Now, hotmail allows forwarding for free only to cetain approved microsoft domains (live.com, hotmail.com, msn.com, etc) but it only checks for the part directly after the @ ! So if you create a fastmail alias with one of the approved hotmail domain names, you can configure your hotmail to forward to anything@approvedhotmaildomain.fastmail.fm. The trick is explained in more detail in this forum thread.\n\n*Fastmail allows sending via an external (i.e. hotmail) SMTP server, even if you're using the fastmail SMTP server in your email client! (gmail also allows to use an external smtp server, but not when you're using an email client setup to use the gmail smtp server, I think, the gmail help article [note at the bottom] is not clear about it) This feature prevents a security warning from popping up with people using hotmail in a browser themselves (because otherwise hotmail thinks you are spamming because you have a hotmail 'From:' address but are sending from a non-hotmail smtp server ). For more info see this page and the linked Fastmail blog past.\nFastmail is an email provider focussed on IMAP. Not free for your purpose though (the free 'Guest' level has very limited storage). For what you want, you'll currently pay around 20$/year\nAll my mail is in my fastmail account, aggregated from different (hotmail and other) accounts. The day hotmail drops the forwarding trick, I'll (finally) drop my hotmail as well.\n(My address book contacts is quite an involved setup as well (but worry free once done). My fastmail contacts are synced two-way with gmail, and this again syncs with the address book of OSX)\n\nA: I was able to get Outlook 2011 and Thunderbird working with mBox with Lion OS.  The issue you are having seems to be a mBox compatibility issue with the Apple Mail program.  I too have sent email to mBox, but there has not been an answer yet.  So I download the free trial of Office.  \nTo setup the account, enter in your email account/password then uncheck the \"Configure automatically\" box.  You can then change the account type to IMAP and the server to localhost:9143 (no SSL) as is required by mBox and the outgoing server smtp.live.com:587 and use SSL to connect.  In the Advanced settings, I checked \"Send multiple commands to the server simultaneously\" to speed up the sync process when the email is read.  If you need more information, I think that the settings were similar to the FluentFactory mBox website instructions for setting up thunderbird.\nThere are still some syncing issues for me, but I can restart mBox easily to solve the issue.\n\nA: I found this fix, thought it might be useful if you still haven't found a fix.\nhttp://nicholasworkshop.wordpress.com/2011/07/24/mbox-mail-for-mac-on-lion-fix-works-with-apple-mail-5/\nI'm gonna try tomorrow--since I have custom domains setup it might be a little more complicated than the regular @hotmail.com account. :S\nGood luck!\n\nA: mBox has updated its product to work with OS X 10.6/7. I use Outlook in combination with mBox on Lion and it works like a charm.\n\nA: Access your hotmail acct, click on \"options\" at the top right corner, then \"see all options\", then make sure you select the Account tab. \nSomewhere in the middle of the screen there is a blue link that says:\nSettings for POP, IMAP, and SMTP access...\nClick on it and a card will appear with some info on it.\nDownload Sparrow, Add a new account, select IMAP and the enter the info provided in the card on hotmail.\nSHould work!\n\nA: TouchDown for OS X\n\nTouchDown® for Mac is the very first ActiveSync enabled desktop client for the Mac OS/X platform. It provides Mac Users with push email against ActiveSync enabled servers.\n\nOS X mail app and all famous apps including Outlook 2011 for Mac don't support Active Exchange, but TouchDown adds Active Exchange to OS X. However, this app is paid.\n\nA: Finally, Micro$oft now supports IMAP!

You can run the software locally, on your box? Thunderbird with ActiveSync extension can work also, but if DavMail works (and there is no guarantee of course), you won't have to stray away from your favorite mail app.\n\nA: Setup your Hotmail account as an exchange account in the apple mail.

(over an ethernet cable) I have a Mac Mini with Snow Leopard (10.6.7). Now I want to share my internet connection with my Xbox 360 Slim. (Don't ask why I don't use the WLAN in my Xbox).\nI found a few tutorials but nothing worked. The Xbox never connects to the internet.\nCan anyone help me?\n\nA: Well, this can be done on either Ethernet or Wi-Fi, but I'll make some basic assumptions for illustration.\nYour Mac Mini is on Wi-Fi. In System Preferences > Sharing, activate Internet Sharing. Choose your From (AirPort) and To (Ethernet) connection types, and you should be good to go after connecting your Mac to your Xbox.\n\nA: You should be able to set your Xbox to use an external MAC address in the network settings. After plugging in the network cable at either end you should set this to your Mac's network card's MAC address. To get that open up your System Preferences and choose 'Network', choose 'Ethernet' from the list of network options on the left and then click the 'Advanced' button on the bottom right. That should give you a dialog with a horizontal tab list, click the far right one called 'Ethernet' and your MAC address is the first thing listed.\nYou also need to make sure 'Internet Sharing' is enabled in the Sharing preferences. You need to pick a network option to share to and from. So in this case you're sharing your Airport internet connection with your wired network card (and anything connected via it).\nThat works for me anyway so if that doesn't help then perhaps try this: http://macapper.com/2009/01/29/tutorial-mac-internet-sharing-with-xbox-360/\n", "Q: How do I disable Microsoft Outlook 2010 calendar notifications?

Is it possible to make Steam games playable on the Guest account? It would be nice to be able to let visitors entertain themselves with e.g. Portal in a sandboxed setting.\nEdit:\nThere may be terms-of-service issues involved.  I will contact Steam.\n\nA: It's highly doubtful that it would work with a guest account, since everything is deleted upon logout.\nIf you created a \"friends\" user account with no password and gave them \"standard\" user access, it might be possible (though it certainly won't be pretty).\nFirst, because Valve apparently has no idea how easy it is to use NSDistributedNotificationCenter to broadcast messages between user accounts, they've set the Steam app up to prohibit multiple instances from running. In other words, for a guest to be able to launch Steam.app in the friends user account, it cannot be running in any other user account. If it is, you'd have to go into that user account first to quit it, then go back to the friends user account. (It honestly takes about 10 lines of code to have Steam broadcast a message to all other user accounts that the Steam that you're launching now is in control, and all other instances could quit themselves, but Valve is fairly challenged with such things).\nSo, provided it isn't running in another user account, it would work. However, given the ridiculous amount of files and data Steam wants to be able to write to inside its own application bundle (inside the Steam.app bundle), you might be better off creating a separate copy of the application altogether, specifically for that user. Reason being, the Steam application will take on the ownership of whoever first installed it, and when another user tries to use it, they won't have write permissions to the application bundle. You could also try modifying the bundle to give it less restrictive permissions. (This whole thing could be handled by using a simple, privileged helper tool).\nSo, provided you have a copy of Steam which the friends' user account has write access to, then we move on to the real fun, which is the several GB worth of .gcf files that make up the content of the game. By default, the game files are stored in:\n/Users/< username >/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/\nSince one user doesn't have access to another user's files (for obvious reasons), you would need to re-download all of the needed files, or copy them over from the other user account. You could also try re-locating the SteamApps folder to a common location that all users have access to, such as the /Applications/ folder. (I've written an application that helps with creating the symbolic link after the relocation process: http://www.markdouma.com/sourcefinagler/). You'll then run into the same issues with permissions as with the app itself, so you'd need to change them to make sure they're writable to the users in question.\nFor a guest account, it might work if you had everything in a central location, and then had a global login item or a launchd job in the /Library/LaunchAgents/ folder that would perform a couple of operations in the guest user account upon login. It would need to copy the files inside the /Users/< username >/Library/Application Support/Steam/ that are responsible for saving the Steam user account and password to the guest user's Application Support folder, so that the user would be able to login automatically without having to enter your Steam ID and password each time. It would also need to make sure there was a \"SteamApps\" symbolic link inside the /Users/< guest >/Library/Application Support/Steam/ to point to the location of the game content files.\nIn short, what you would like to do, i.e. be able to play Steam games from another user account on the same Mac, is a perfectly reasonable desire. As far as I know, it's something that is already possible in the Windows version of Steam, without having to jump through 100 hoops first. It's also something that's entirely possible for them to have done in the Mac OS X version by using a central data location along with a privileged helper tool (I've been using such an approach in my own application for the last 7 years and it works well). In its current implementation, however, it's not possible to do this in the Mac version without some pretty ugly workarounds.\n\nA: One of the features of the Guest account, is that all of the data is deleted once the user logs off. Steam stores the games and config information in the User's Application Support directory.\nWhat you could do instead, is create an account, call it whatever you want and don't set a password. Then, login as this account, download Steam, store your password and setup the games for that account.\nPlease note that there are security considerations involved with making an open login like this. In addition, there are likely concerns with the terms of service for using Steam in such a manner. I shall leave those thought exercises for you, though.\n", "Q: Change Snow Leopard System Font Color This seems like it should be simple, but I've googled and gooled and still can't find an answer.\nHow can I change the System font color on Mac OS X 10.6.7?\n\nA: Apple removed official support for \"skinning\" Mac OS X aeons ago. The only changes that you can make easily involve installing new icon sets.\nThere is no way to do this short of hacking binary files.\n", "Q: How can I avoid Time Machine starts to back up files right after the Mac is restarted? Sometimes I have to restart my Mac Mini because an application blocks it.\nWhen I restart it, Time Machine starts to back up files right after 10 seconds I restarted the Mac, and it makes it slowly (I have 4 applications/tools that are opened at login).\nIs there a way to avoid Time Machine starts to back up files, if not after X minutes I restarted the Mac (X could be a value between 10-30 minutes)?\n\nA: I've found two TimeMachine schedulers softwares: TimeMachineEditor and TimeMachineScheduler.  \nBoth are useful to set the backup interval of Time Machine but none of them enable user to define a time limit (after mac startup) before which Time Machine can't be launched. \nHowever, TimeMachineScheduler has an interesting option to skip backup during a user defined time slot. That may be a decent workaround if you're able to define the time slot -during which you may be \"doing something urgent\"- that requires Time Machine to be off.\n", "Q: What's taking up all of this \"Other\" space on my iPhone? I have a jailbroken iPhone, and it's low on space. Much of the wasted space seems to have been consumed by the \"Other\" part of the space display in iTunes.\nHow can I get a breakdown of how that space is being used? The restore process from my backup may have left some extra crap around, so I'm thinking that maybe some of it's just incidental data that I could clean up if I knew what was there.\nOn my mac, I'd use DaisyDisk or something like it; does something like that exist for iPhones?\n\nA: This space is taken by Application Metadata, and is also taken by Jailbreak applications since iTunes doesn't know that these are regular apps. Doing a full restore of your iPhone through iTunes should clear up this space. There aren't any utilities like DaisyDisk for iOS and the closest thing is iFile on Cydia, an application for managing the files on your device.\n\nA: I have found that there is a folder \"var/mobile/media/applicationarchives\" that strores zip versions of your apps when attempting to appsync to itunes. If there is an interruption, the file may not auto delete and still occupy the space. You simply ssh into that directory and delete. BAM!- you're good.\n", "Q: How can I protect a preference file? I use Mobile Me to synchronize the settings of three different Macs, but I have some problems with specific preference file because one of the Macs runs Mac OS X Lion.\nI would like to avoid that specific preference file is overwritten in the Mac running Mac OS X Lion. How can I do that?\n\nA: You want to remove \"write permission\" from the file, so it cannot be written to. If you block MobileMe from writing to it, you will also be blocking the application from writing to it, which could cause problems.\nVia the command line:\nchmod u-w file.plist # u-w means \"Remove Write from User\"\nchmod u+w file.plist # Undo: add user write permissions back again\n\nFrom the Finder, do CMD+I (Get Info), and under \"Sharing & Permissions\" at the bottom, set it to read only.\nIf you need to write to the file (perhaps for the application to work properly), you can temporarily make it write-able, or approach this with a different solution. For example, you could use DropBox, link the file to DropBox from all your Snow Leopard computers, and just not link the file on the Lion computer.\n\nA: I found that removing write permission from some preference files is insufficient, since write permission needs to be enabled on ~/Library/Preferences to change almost every preference there is. Write permission on a folder means you can delete any file within it, even those owned by another user & read-only to you. A lot of programs update files in what they call an \"atomic\" fashion, which in practical terms means they write the new file under another name, delete the original, & rename the new file to the old file's name. The Dock is one such program—setting com.apple.dock.plist to read-only doesn't stop it updating.\nTo get around this is thankfully rather simple: set the file's \"Locked\" attribute.  Cmd+I in the Finder will get you a checkbox to check, & if you prefer using the Terminal the commands for locking & unlocking a file are:\nchflags uchange the_file     # to lock the_file\nchflags nouchange the_file   # to unlock the_file\n\n...where uchange can be replaced with uchg or uimmutable.\n", "Q: Dictionary application doesn't show all the dictionaries I can use I have a problem with the Dictionary application: all in a sudden, without any changes on the preferences, the application doesn't show all the dictionaries I can look a word in the toolbar that appears under the title bar.\nThe Mac synchronizes its preferences with another Mac (through Mobile Me), but in the other Mac the application shows the usual list of dictionaries, as it is used to do, and how it should do basing on the application preferences.\nWhat can I do to resolve the issue?\n\nA: I have resolved the issue by copying the setting file (com.apple.Dictionary.plist) from the other Mac.\nI made a copy of the file, in the case I could have the same issue.\n", "Q: How can I get some basic GNU utilities on my iPhone? I'm specifically looking for du, but really, I want the usual suite of command line power tools. Which package contains those?\n\nA: Using dpkg -S du I discovered that there is a copy of du in the Cydia libexec folder. It's not quite as nice as finding it in /bin, but it'll serve my purposes nicely. The general question is still open, though; where can I find awk, sed, and so on?\n\nA: coreutils provides du and other CLI tools.\n", "Q: Configure iTunes to equalize based on \"Genre\" tag? Is there a way to configure iTunes to configure the equalizer based on \"Genre\" tag of a given song?\n\nA: The first method that comes to mind :\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Genre column header to\nsort your songs based on genre  \n\n*Select all songs belonging to a\ngiven genre.  \n\n*Option+I to bring information dialog, go to Options tab\n\n*Select Equalizer Preset that corresponds to the genre\n\n\nRepeat steps 2 to 4 for each genre.\n", "Q: Lost search function iPhone after upgrading to 4.3 Does anyone know how or why the search function in my text messaging is no longer working correctly after I upgraded to 4.3 on my 3G iPhone? \nAll was fine until I upgraded and now even tho I can see a name in a text for example I search for it and it comes back as \"No results\".\n\nA: Searching SMS messages was disabled due to battery life and performance concerns for the 3G, you can see this in the iPhone: Which iOS 4 software features does my iPhone support? article on apple.com \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4204\n\niPhone 3G does not support Spotlight search for SMS/MMS messages.\n\n", "Q: Task switching on iOS 4.3.1? I just upgraded my iPod (4gen) from iOS 4.3 to 4.3.1.  Pressing the button twice now no longer brings up the app switcher.\nIs there some setting I need to change to bring this back?  I didn't see anything in the release notes about removing or disabling this feature.\n\nA: I played around with it for a few minutes, and eventually it went back to the old mode where task switching works.  I have no idea why, and I didn't change any setting.\nIt's not just the speed: I've never had trouble getting task switching to work, and for the first 10 minutes after upgrading, it didn't work no matter how fast I clicked it.  It would zip over to the useless search screen and back really fast.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my iPod Classic show all the songs it holds? I recently bought a new iPod Classic 120GB, mainly to use on my Numark iDJ2 but also for general use.\nI have it set so that all my iTunes songs are automatically pulled over to it and when I look at its contents on iTunes all my songs are there. However, if I unplug it and then search through it manually, some artists don't appear. (I haven't yet found a pattern.)\nThe only reason I mention my iDJ2 is that I have Numark's 'Librarian' software installed on my iPod so that the iDJ2 can categorize and play all of my songs. I don't see how it should be responsible for this problem though.\nAny help much appreciated and let me know if you need any more info.\n\nA: Could it be that some albums are tagged as \"Compilation\"? In this case the artists in these albums are not shown in the \"Artists\" submenu... Uncheck the \"Compilation\" check-box (or something like that - I don't use iTunes!) in the Information tab and they magically appear in the list.\nPS. When you select an artist that \"has\" a proper album, the songs in the Compilation albums are also shown.\n", "Q: How can I safely eliminate duplicate apps from my iPhone? I have just had my iPhone replaced under warranty, and when restoring it from backup much of my preexisting free space vanished.\nWhat I've found, after some shell hacking, is that I appear to have duplicate installs of several apps, some of which are quite large.

This is a problem, obviously, because space is precious on these machines.\nHow can I determine which apps iTunes believes to be installed, so that I can safely remove the unused duplicates?\n\nA: The hard easiest way would be to wipe your phone, and re-download all the apps again. You won't pay twice: iTunes is clever enough to know what you already downloaded.\nBut at this stage, I think you'll be better off. It also gives you the confidence that you've done something from scratch. And I think the time it takes will outweigh the time to clear out the list of duplicates.\n\nA: You should be able to clear out all these duplicates by doing a full restore in iTunes, I'm not sure how to check to see which ones are duplicates, though.\n", "Q: downgrade printer driver my printer (it is samsung ml 1640, if that matters) exhibits random failures since updating its software. the update went through apple software update. it worked fine before update. so, obvious fix would be uninstalling the offending package, i suppose. how can this be achieved? i must confess i have no clue... i'm running os x 10.6.6 on a 2006 macbook.\nthanks \n\nA: Usually, the most surefire way to get a specific printer driver is to download it from the manufacturer's website.\nFor your printer, drivers can be found here. It says they haven't been updated since 2009, so you'll probably be going back to the old version.\n(Note: Of course, this will restore the functionality of whatever version of the driver you're installing. It may break things or it may fix them depending on how good that particular driver is.)\n\nA: Have you tried toggling Printer Sharing in the System Preferences? I had a similar experience after applying Apple's software updates with my printer and that fixed it.\nImmediately after updating my printer tasks would quit from the queue. I reinstalled the old drivers but that didn't change anything.\nThe Samsung ML 1640 app that OS X creates (the one that opens when you print something and shows the queue) was also not responding or showing print queue items, and asked to update to the most recent drivers. I then tried the printer sharing trick, and just speculating here, I think that actually changes the permissions on some of the printer files and fixes it.\n", "Q: Application level volume control in OS X? I recently switched from PC to Mac and one thing I miss is Windows' application-level volume control (i.e. mute Firefox, turn up iTunes, turn down Skype etc). How can I achieve the same on a Mac?

Xcode is required to build the binaries.\n\nA: A free and open-source solution is BackgroundMusic.\nA nicer and paid solution is Rogue Amoeba's SoundSource\n\nA: Just found http://volumemixer-app.com/ it's very similar to the one found on windows.\n\nA: Here's a possible workaround, for a subset of use cases, that doesn't require any new software.\nWe use Slack at work, and I like to play iTunes kinda loud (in my headphones).  Sometimes I was missing Slack audible \"bings\".\nJust fyi that you can set iTunes volume lower in the iTunes UI, and then set the overall system volume in upper right system menu reasonably high, so that relatively the non-iTunes notifications will be noticeable.\nBasically:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes volume can bet set independently of other sounds, WITHIN the iTunes UI\n\n*And then the overall volume in the upper right controls the\ncombination of everything.\n\n\nI suspect this works in other apps that have an independent volume control.\nNote: I see some possibly similar answers with negative votes, but I've taken the time to explain how it works, and clearly disclosed that it's a subset/workaround to what was asked, so please don't ding me for this answer.\nThis is one of those things that's \"obvious\" to gurus, but not obvious to the rest of the folks using Mac.\n\nA: Rogue Amoeba's SoundSource utility does exactly this, and more.\nhttps://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/\n\n\nA: I just figured out how to do this on macOS Sierra.

And it's free.\n\nA: SoundBunny ($9.99) also provides this function. Supports 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8\nSoundBunny by Prosoft Engineering\nUpdate: As pointed out below by Steve Moser SoundBunny cannot change the volume of Sandboxed applications.\n\nA: I use Butler & USB Overdrive to setup key commands and map media keys (play/pause/skip back+fwd/volume/mute) to control iTunes & Spotify, as well as other system wide controls.  Regular in-app key commands can be setup in the Mac OS System Prefs -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts.\nWhile these will give you more control via key commands when you're working in the app, they won't work if the specified app is in the background. So if you want to change the volume of iTunes or Spotify, skip tracks, or pause while you are working in another app, these 2 apps will allow you to do that. Both apps provide built-in basic iTunes controls, but I had to use AppleScript to control Spotify.\nHere are some Applescript examples that can be used for these types of functions in both of these apps:  Alvin Alexander: iTunes AppleScript examples (command examples).\n\nA: I also found Sound Control by Static Z Software. I've personally not used it so YMMV.\n\nA: On mac, with i tunes the command is cmd and the UP arrow, this also works for divx, vlc ext, with the internet, just use the volume controls F11 / F12. \nNo need to spend monies on silly apps!\n\nA: Control+Command+Up/Down Arrows works for me Mac OS 10.9.5\n\nA: While focused on the app..

It currently has 6G of ram (2x1G and 2x2G sticks).  I've been swapping with some programs for a while, and just got around to buying more ram.  (4x4G).  \nMy question is. . . am I better off just running the 4x4G or should I just add the 4x4G to the ram I already have?  (my gut says more is better, of course just add, but I know there are often hardware considerations that may make this not true)\n\nA: Considering you have Pairs of equal memory (2x1G, 2x2G and 4x4G) the best option is to install them all (that's a lot of RAM!).\nEarly 2008's Mac Pros use the full memory bandwidth when modules are installed in Pairs (like you have). But their location in the risers (where you install the modules) is important. Therefore, you should follow what the manual says.\nSince you're going to fill all the 8 slots, you can go ahead an install them in pairs one next to the other. You have 2 risers, so here's how you should put them:\nTOP RISER\nSLOT 1: 1x4GB\nSLOT 2: 1x4GB\nSLOT 3: 1x4GB\nSLOT 4: 1x4GB\nBOTTOM RISER\nSLOT 1: 1x2GB\nSLOT 2: 1x2GB\nSLOT 3: 1x1GB\nSLOT 4: 1x1GB\nThe graphic explanation for this can be read in the Early 2008 Mac Pro Memory Manual, located at manuals.info.apple.com.\n", "Q: Camera+ DV high res pictures? I bought the Camera+ app for my iPodTouch yesterday because it was on sale and because I thought that it could be used to get images with as high a resolution as when using the video feature of the device.  \nIs this possible, or have I been sorely mis-informed and thus ripped off another 99 cents for an app? :)\nI noticed there's a setting under Quality that says that setting it to Optimized which reads: \"Photos are saved with a maximum size of 1200x1200 for faster sharing and saving\" which is what made me wonder...\nP.S. Please tag this with \"resolution\" and Camera+ as well. Thanks!\n\nA: Warning: high geekery follows.\nWhen the UIPhotoPicker control (which manages still/video capture from the camera as well as selection of images from the image library) returns a camera image to the app that launched it, the image is at native resolution of the camera, which is Very Very Big. 5 megapixels at 2592 x 1936. \nAn image object takes up space in the app's memory allocation, obviously. The amount it takes up is 4 bytes per pixel (r, g, b, and alpha). So an image at full resolution takes up 2592 x 1936 x 4 pixels: almost 20 megabytes. On a device that starts to complain if you take up (on the latest, beefiest version of the hardware) more than 30 or 40 mb. \nSo the solution to that that most developers employ is to immediately scale the image down to something manageable, memory-wise, pretty much immediately on capture. An app that promised full resolution images would need to do nearly nothing else. It was only in the last couple versions of the hardware that we didn't have to dump a whole bunch of stuff from memory before going for a camera image.\n", "Q: Transferring data from old macbook to new macbook Is there an easy way to transfer my applications and data from my old macbook pro to my new macbook pro?

You load the photos from Lightroom onto the iPad with the Itunes file sharing feature, and you can then edit metadata on the ipad offline. The results can be sent back to Lightroom by copying the photos out of the iTunes file sharing feature.\nThe drawback of this workflow is mainly three things:\n1) Cumbersome to manually drag and drop photos between iTunes to sync\n2) Not good workflow to get metadata back to e.g. Lightroom, as you need to overwrite the old photos with the new edited ones from iPad (if I understood it correctly)\n3) If you want the photos to appear in the photos.app, you need to have the same photos twice on the iPad, eating double disk space.\n\nA: As per my experience Sortshots is an excellent app!!Very easy to use and works perfect for me.\n\nA: A new app called Photosmith might fit the bill - it allows tagging and organising on the iPad and has a Lightroom plugin on the computer that syncs with your iPad.\n", "Q: Trying to install vsftpd via mac ports on snow leopard Using this guide: http://www.finiteloops.com/weblog/?p=79\nI get this error:\n500 OOPS: vsftpd: not configured for standalone, must be started from inetd\n\nI am trying to turn on and off LISTEN in the config, but how to either link VSFTPD with INET or XINET or let it start in listen mode?\n\nA: The man page for the config file for vsftpd should be of some help.

Of course, one needs to be able to use LaTeX, but it streamlines the compilation, highlights syntax and generally helps. Of course, on tex.stackexchange.com, they'll be glad to help more.\n\nA: I am guessing that you are saying is that LaTeX seems too difficult (or rather too complex) rather than that TextMate is too difficult to use.\nIf you want an editor that lowers the level of LaTeX knowledge you need to produce a document, I do not really think there exists one (i.e. you still have to compile and check for errors, solve bibliography bugs etc).\nAn option would be to write the document in MultiMarkdown which converts into LaTeX. You can do this in Scrivener which also happens to be a very good writing environment.\nMultiMarkdown is a markup language that is quite intuitive and easy to read (in fact Ask Different uses Markdown (MultiMarkdown's parent) to format comments).\n... otherwise there is always LyX which aims to be LaTeX but without the need to learn LaTeX, but you might run into stuff that you want to do, but can't.\n\nA: Whatever you do, advise him or her to install MacTex - it is the easiest way to get LaTeX on your mac. By the way: The TeXShop mentioned my DaG is in that package, too.\nBut I agree with fnurl on that: As long as you write LaTeX, it will be \"hard\" to learn. No matter what GUI-Applications helps you. Because if you hide everything behind buttons, you loose LaTeX's advantage and you could be using Pages or Word instead. \n\nA: There's a recent addition called Texpad available in the Mac App Store. Simple, streamlined and well-integrated with OS X.\n\nTexpad is a LaTeX editor designed for straightforward navigation of projects of any size. When Texpad opens a document it scans through it, looking for LaTeX structure commands and any included files, then it presents you with an outline view with which you can swiftly navigate the entire project.\n\n\nA: If you're looking to do homework or other more casual writing, try Archimedes: http://www.mattrajca.com/archimedes\nIt has great code completion support for mathematical symbols, includes an extensive math library, and even lets you enter mathematical symbols by drawing them on your trackpad!\n", "Q: Can iPods (3rd gen) brick completely if left uncharged? I have an old 3rd generation iPod, barely used it since I got an iPhone a couple of years ago. I wasn't expecting the battery to hold its charge anymore (I've replaced it once or twice already, infact), but even when plugged in there is no reaction, the device is just dead.\nIs this the natural conclusion of leaving it idle/flat for many months? Or do you think there is another problem with the device? (I could perhaps get a replacement battery but I'm not sure that would help)\n\nA: Lithium-ion polymer batteries should not be deep discharged. This is a quote from Lithium-ion Polymer wikipedia page\n\nDuring discharge on load, the load has to be removed as soon as the voltage drops below approximately 3.0 V per cell (used in a series combination), or else the battery will subsequently no longer accept a full charge and may experience problems holding voltage under load. This can be achieved, as with other lithium-ion batteries, also harmed by under- and over-voltage, by circuitry that prevents overcharge and deep discharge.\n\nSo discharging batteries below some threshold will make it unable to recharge. The best way to store your battery is to keep it charged around 50%.\nOn the Apple Batteries iPod page, Apple says that you should:\n\nUse iPod Regularly\n  For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Be sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month. If you use your iPod infrequently (gasp), you might want to add a reminder to your calendar program\n\nSo my conclusion is that your usage pattern could be a probable cause for your battery problem.\n", "Q: PC-like keyboard emulation on Mac OS X 10.6.3 I got myself a Mac Mini and started using it with a PC keyboard as I don't have the time to learn Apple keyboard shortcuts at the moment.\nI was wondering if there is some kind of keyboard emulator that will make Home, End, ^→, and ^← work as they do in Windows.\n\nA: The quick answer is \"no\".  Each application is going to have its own set of keystrokes to perform certain actions, and most of those are built around the OSX standard way of doing things.  For example, in Firefox Command+1 will always be the option for the first tab, even if you find some way of doing what you want.  Command+Tab will not cycle through individual windows, only applications, etc.\nYou can try some of the \"shortcuts\" listed in this similar question, or this similar answer, but this is basically adding training wheels, and is not likely to work with every application.\nFor the long run, your best bet is to ditch the PC keyboard (not that it makes any difference, except what logo is on the Command key) and start learning.  After a week or two of using OSX every day, you'll probably find that your level of comfort with your new OS has skyrocketed, and you're using command+v to paste without thinking about it.\n\nA: Like Jack M I agree that you should try to learn the more common apple shortcuts. But for special cases try KeyRemap4Macbook. Besides PC-style remapping you can have emacs- and vi-mode and any other remapping you can and can't think of.\nCheck out the all the possible keybindings here.\nhttp://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/list.html\n\nA: There is a great program that enables this functionality in OSX called \"Better Touch Tool\". It used to be free but is now costs money ($6 I think). This let's you easily create system-wide or software-specific key bindings. It also enables MS Windows like window snapping, where you can drag a window to the side of the screen to have the window take up half of the monitor, etc.\n", "Q: finding the remote IP address used by a mounted SMB share Using Finder, I have mounted an SMB share which resides on my NAS .

In a nutshell, the DVD I was using to reinstall OS X was too old for my system. So here’s the takeaway from this post which I had to spend many hours figuring out: when you want to reinstall your Mac, please make sure you use the disc that came with your system!\n\nA: I think that the problem is your new ram. You have upgraded with 1333MHz DDR3, and you should use 1066MHz DDR3 RAM. The problem is that the chipset does not downclock your ram to 1066MHz and when MacOS enters graphic mode, the machine freezes.\nThe problem lies somewhere within the low performance (shared memory) graphic chip MacOS drivers. Under text mode, MacOS works perfectly. Running Apple Hardware Test and testing ram (1333MHz) also works. I have been told that Windows runs also.\nIf you cannot replace your new ram (it's was hard for me to find 1066MHz 4GB SO-DIMMs), you can temporary fix this problem by inserting one slow (1066MHz) DIMM (if you still have it) and one of the new 1333MHz. This will make chipset run your MBP with the least common speed, and your notebook will boot.\nI have found and published a way to downclock your ram and fix this issue in this Apple Support Discusions thread. I'm quoting myself:\n\nIt's possible with a software Thaiphoon Burner (http://www.softnology.biz/) to modify the SPD EPROM (a small non volatile flash, located on the memory, containing information about it) IF the EPROM is not protected (http://www.softnology.biz/tips_pswprotection.html).\n\nIf you decide to take this path of flashing the SPD EPROM of your RAM, I could expand this or make a new one question, to cover in details the flash process.\n", "Q: How to get iTunes to stop encrypting iPhone backups without the password?

I don't need the data that is encrypted but I would like new backups to stop being encrypted as I forgot the password so I would like to disable old backups and keep new backups in place without password. \nI know one of the options is to wipe iPhone clean and start over but that doesn't seem good to me. So i'm searching for a more pleasant way to drop old backups with password and be able to make new ones :-)\nI use Windows 7.\n\nA: Things you can try (that I haven't tried myself), other than hoping it's not an Apple bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a 4 digit lockcode on the iPhone, the encryption on iTunes might share the same password. Try the same pin. Also try older pins, if you change it. It could be an old one.\n\n*Get iPhone Explorer, delete /var/Keychains/Keychains-2.db (may need to jailbreak the phone to be able to see it) on it and restart. Be aware this will clear all your passwords. Now delete your iTunes encrypted backups and re-sync.\n\n*Enter DFU mode, wipe your phone, and sync back - this is an easy way to remove the lock code, not sure about the encrypt iphone check tho. Probably.\n\n*Use some mysterious magic tool, enter in recovery mode to begin with a lot more of hacking. I won't get into much detail here because this isn't a simple procedure. You're on your own. Just wanted to cite it's possible and that maybe even today the \"encryption\" is quite fake.\n\n*Restore from an old unencrypted backup. Yes, this is the closest step to \"wipe\".\n\n*As you already suggested, wipe your phone (just for the sake of completeness).\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: Think I've fixed it!\nMy encryption backup password in iTunes WAS an old iPhone lock screen password I used a while ago (probably when I set up the encryption). But that code won't work if the phone number is different—very stupid if you ask me!\nI tried and failed several times this evening to disable the iTunes backup encryption using that passcode and then I noticed that the \"Phone Number\" quoted in the iPhone summary tab was different, because I recently got a new pay-as-you-go SIM. I got the old one out of the drawer, put it in and now my old passcode lock code works.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the SIM in the iPhone is the same as when you encrypted the file\n\n*Enter an old passcode lock \n\n\nRegards to point 2 above, I don't know if I chose that myself or if it's a default, but the point is that the code WOULDN'T unlock it with a different SIM and then DID with the right SIM. \n", "Q: AppTamer for RAM Does anyone know of an app like AppTamer http://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/index.html that frees RAM usage and not just CPU?\n\nA: Hate to say this, but RAM isn't something that can just magically be erased without an impact on the system. There are four kinds of ram:\nFree - is free to use and optimal for use when applications are opened\nInactive - is memory that is no longer used that is deleted when needed. Inactive memory allows for past tasks to occur faster when being repeated (for example launching an application that was previously used but then quit). This RAM basically acts as FREE RAM and the system deletes it and uses it when needed, but deleting it without needing to will actually hinder ur macs performance since these caches will be deleted.\nActive & Wired - is used by currently running applications and in NO CASE can it be deleted without a system impact.\nWhat i'm getting at, is that there is no reason to have to clear ram, that which can be cleared is cleared automatically when needed and that which can't be cleared just... can't be cleared :P\n\nA: There's an app in the Mac App Store called iCleanMemory which claims to do this.\nAlternatively you can fire up terminal and type \"purge\" although this may only be available if you have the developer tools installed.\n", "Q: HD webcam for iChat I've seen a couple of Mac compatible HD webcams for sale, but they often come with the caveat of falling back to VGA resolutions when used with any application not supported by the camera manufacturer.

I would hold out for the Logitech ... maybe a updated Driver will fix the issues.\n\nA: Saw this on Mashable and thought about the question :\nhttp://mashable.com/2011/05/24/logitech-c910-review/\n", "Q: Install 10.6 over 10.5 on iMac Currently my iMac has 10.5.8 Mac Os X installed. \nI want to install 10.6.6 over 10.5.8 (iMac (intel Dual core)).\nDo I have to do the following ??\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit Apple Store.\n\n*Buy 10.6 OS X for USD $29.00\n\n*Simply insert installation disk in the computer and follow and execute install instructions.\n\n*All the existing applications (including FinalCutExpress) will continue to work as usual.\n\n\nPlease confirm.\nThanks..\n\nA: To offer you a different point of view: I assume you're going to have a Backup of your system before performing such a drastic operation. \nIf you do have a backup, I strongly advice you to install Snow Leopard from scratch and then, using migration assistant, transfer your data from your backup (Time Machine or clone).\nI have upgraded seven machines from Leopard to Snow Leopard. Three with the method you describe and four with a fresh install. \nI had problems with two of the upgraded machines (that eventually had to be reinstalled) and zero problems with the fresh installs.\nThat's my experience and ymmv, but bear in mind that the changes to the underlying system between Leopard and Snow Leopard justify a fresh start :)\nYou can always try the upgrade, but always have a backup, there are a lot of things that -depending upon your system- can fail.\n\nA: You're correct about steps 1 thru 3. You're mostly correct for step 4.\nOnce you install the new OS, you won't lose any data or settings or anything like that. \nHowever, know that not all apps are 10.6-compatible. Almost all are, but not everything is.\nHere's a wiki with info about which apps are compatible.\nAgain, most are, but you may have a few that won't work, or will work poorly.\nBasically, just be careful. Check your important software first.\nAs for Final Cut Express: I can't imagine that any recent version wouldn't be compatible (Apple makes Final Cut and OS X).\n\nA: though you can do it, and most stuff will still work, \"updating\" a system on top of another system is never good.  at the very least, disk usage will not be efficient. \nit is always best to format your disk and install from scratch.\nin case you have a version of snow leopard that doesnt work (is not accepted by your machine because of hardware version restrictions), check out THIS TÜTORIAL, which will work as long as your machine is fit to run snow leopard (list available online).\n", "Q: Cannot watch iTunes purchased media with old Apple ID When attempting to watch purchased older material on iTunes I have been receiving a prompt stating that my MacBook is not authorized to view material. As the material was purchased unsing my original Apple ID - having since changed ID's twice - I am not able to view this material without entering the password for the old ID. I am then directed through iForgot to the change the password. Here iForgot states the prompting information provided is not recognized. As I cannot enter a password for this old ID I cannot view this material\nI am having similar problems with apps purchased on my iPhone under this original ID. \nSounds like others are dealing with the same issue. Any solutions? \n\nA: If you remember the old id and still have access to the email account associated with it, you can definitely reset the password and then authorize your macbook to play these files.\niForgot will prompt you for information, but it should allow a password reset via email, not just questions. If you still cannot remember/access the info, I recommend sending apple an email via their iTunes store support and see if they can identify you via other means.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact.html\n\nA: The issue is the built in DRM in these files, specifically intended to keep you from playing music that you didn't purchase.  Your best bet is to re-activate those older Apple ID's and enter them in, authorizing your computer.  That will be the simplest way.\nThe only other ways that I know of are to re-encode the data to a non-DRM format, which will likely be much more difficult than finding your old Apple ID's.\n", "Q: Print .docx without Pages.app Sometimes I simply want to print Microsoft Word documents. If I view them in Quick Look, they display as I would like to print them. However, when I try to print them from the Finder, it opens Pages.app and the rendering is significantly different.\nIs there anyway to print the document as Quick Look renders it?\n\nA: You can open Word documents with the built-in TextEdit app.\nIt will display and print them the same way (as far as I can tell) as QuickLook does.\n", "Q: Ipod nano touch podcast sync issues (can't delete some podcasts) As you can see in the photo, my iPod has several podcasts.  But iTunes only displays one.\nIt doesn't always show the subscribed podcasts, sometimes does, but not always. If I drag (copy) a podcast to the ipod, it then shows on iTunes, but it may dissapear later.\nIn the iPod, the podcasts always show, but I can't delete the ones I don't need anymore.\nHow can I solve this?\nShould I manage all podcasts through subscription and not drag individual episodes? or can I mix both methods?\n\n\nA: The podcasts part of iTunes just manage those you have either subscribed to, or subscribed and unsubscribed but still have episodes. It looks like your issue is related to trying to manually manage these, which will let you add the files to your iPod, but iTunes really doesn't know about the structure behind them. \nI would recommend having it manage them for you. In that case, you can also tell it to delete those (or keep those) you want after you listen. \nFor example, I have a couple of concerts from NPR on my iPod that I keep, but my other daily/weekly podcasts delete after they have been listened too. \nI expect the reason you are seeing the difference between iTunes and the iPod is the way you are currently mixing the two methods.  \n\nA: I recently had this problem with my iPod Nano 2G.  The \"help\" function actually had useful advice:  highlight the podcast/song and press the \"delete\" button on the keyboard.  \nIn summary, it worked.  \n", "Q: Maximum current that could be drawn out of iPhone 4 headphone Jack? Any clues regarding this value? I couldn't figure it out. I am trying to find the power budget for devices such as Square (www.squareup.com)\nThx\n\nA: In your example of the Square Reader, it can be deceptive. I too wondered how there was power running to the headphone jack as Apple requires/uses the dock connector to charge, sync, etc. All the add-on devices use the dock and other than headphones I don't know of companies using the headphone jack. Why had no one used it before Square. Read on... \nThe Square reader actually takes the magnetic information from the swiped card and turns it into audio tones. These tones are then interpreted by the Square App and allow it to process the swipe like a regular credit/debit card transaction.\nIn my opinion, a very elegant programming solution.\n\nA: I checked this on the Wikipedia page for the iPhone it says that it's a TRRS connector\nYou might get some more info there :\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRRS_connector\n", "Q: How can I stop QuickTime from opening WMV embeds?

I'd like to create a TextMate project that consists of all files in a particular folder, with the added stipulation that as files are added to (or removed from) that folder that they be added/removed from the TextMate project.\nIs this possible?\nI'd love to have a TextMate project that can mirror the list of files being worked with by the folder storing Elements files...\n\nA: Isn't it how it's working already?\nI just tried drag'n'dropping a folder on the Textmate icon, it opens in \"project mode\", then I added a file to the folder, which Textmate did too, when gaining focus. And deleting the file and focusing Textmate made it disappear from the project pane.\n\nA: Inside a TextMate project, there's two \"folder\"-ish concepts: Groups (beige icon) and Folders (blue icon).\nGroups are things that exist only inside the project, and let you organize references to files however you see fit, without affecting the external location of those files.\nFolders are references to actual folders. This is what you want. To add a folder reference to an existing project, just drag the folder from the Finder onto the project drawer. \n\nA: It does indeed work this way, though the project tree can be slow to update if you're adding files on the fly (for example, using \"save as...\")\n\nA: TextMate doesn't do a good job of creating .jar projects for you. I think they are still working on it, but I couldn't find a proper way to make a project using TextMate. Actually, it might be that they do have a feature for making projects, but I just didn't find out.\nAfter you use TextMate to compile and get all the necessary class files, use another code editor like Eclipse or NetBeans and make a project from there. That's what I did...\n\nA: *\n\n*Add the TextMate app to the Mac's Dock (the floating dashboard menu)\n\n*Drag & Drop the Project's Directory over the TextMate Icon on the Dock\n\n*Then you can refine project settings in Preferences → Project\n", "Q: Can I do anything to have my iPod Touch (2nd gen) louder?

It shows how to create your own service that is independent of Safari.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/369934/mac-os-x-lion-chrome-shortcut-for-search-with-google\n\nA: I believe \"Search in Google\" is a Mac OS X service provided by Apple. Maybe since they don't know how to pass a webpage in parameter for every browser in the wild, I suppose they limited it to Safari.\nWhat you might try, is to develop your own Service, then go to\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\nDisable the \"Search in Google\" by Apple and replace it with your own.\nYou could also try to edit Apple's Service and replace Safari with the browser you want.\nSince I'm not on my Mac right now, I can't search for them or look if you can edit them.\n", "Q: I think, I screwed up the color profiles on my macbook as you can see in the example shot, the color in the image are not consistent on my macbook. In the finder the image looks nice, but in Quick Look and iPhoto there is too much red in the images. The effect happens with photos I downloaded from the net, like this one, and with pictures I have taken with my camera. \nDo you have an explanation?\nThanks for your time in advance!\n[added info] \nI experienced this problem on my 2008 macbook with photos I shot myself as with images I downloaded like the example image. Furthermore did I put my macbook to sleep and attached it via dvi to a dell P2411H trying what mspasov suggested. So I am not sure if my playing around with the color calibration ( I ended up using the existing Color LCD profile) actually fixed or that it was only a coincidence that the images looked normal again.\nOne idea I had was that maybe OSX/iPhoto/Quicklook sometimes get 'confused' on how to treat color profiles in images when another monitor is attached. I know, that sounds very far fetched. What do you think?\n\nA: This is probably caused by bad color calibration profile. You could load the default profile for your hardware, or try to calibrate your monitor.\nTry loading the default profile of your display. This is done by opening Preferences -> Displays, Choose the Color tab and select the Color LCD (I'm asuming MacBook PRO, on other machine or external monitor this will be different).\nIf this doesn't help - try calibrating your monitor by pressing the Calibrate.. button and following the onscreen instructions..\n\nA: It's not your monitor profile that's causing this. It's how each application is reading/not reading the color space information in your images. The image you uploaded has an embedded profile called simply \"Display\"--which is a pretty small-gamut profile, as MacBook Pros tend to be. If I assign Adobe 1998 to the left side, I get an exact match to the right side. And that's what happening somewhere in your workflow.\nCalibrating your monitor will alter somewhat the way your images display, but it won't stop this. That's going to take getting a handle on your color spaces throughout your workflow.\n", "Q: Is it safe to enter your credentials on eBuddy for iPhone? I'm hesitant in using it, as it asks for all your passwords for your messaging programs.\nWhat is their privacy policy?

However, this totally ruins the whole management aspect as I do not know what I have not listened to.\nThis is most annoying as some have dropped off the RSS feeds so I have to manually find them... (trying to see at the moment if I can put them inside the right podcast section and not just as a mp3).\nHow can I tell iTunes that it does not know what I want and just to do what it is told!?\n\nA: You cannot get iTunes to stop doing this, sadly, and I don't think you can exactly re-implement the Doug's Applescripts solution for expired playlists for Windows - it relies on manually updating each podcast rather than calling update all. And the iTunes COM object does not seem to expose a way to update individual podcasts, only the entire list.\nAnd I am 99% certain that Matthew is incorrect and that refreshing all is not sufficient to bypass the recently listened count. The wperry link will mark the podcast as listened to, which is the same issue as your workaround that you find unacceptable. \nI do think, however, that you can workaround this issue by right-clicking and choosing refresh. While that's unnecessary to actually get new episodes when you have periodic updates set, it will reset the clock, as it were, and prevent it from stopping when you don't listen for a while. Whether this is actually any better than just dealing with it as it comes up, however, I don't know.\n\nA: Agreed, annoying. Here's someone's VBScript to tickle iTunes (after accumulating five unplayed podcasts) so it will download more:\nhttp://wperry1.dyndns.org:81/personal/projects/CodeLib/detail.asp?id=48\n\nA: If you select the Podcasts tab and click the \"Refresh\" button in the lower-right corner it will update everything that's not already expired and will, effectively, reset the expiration counter.\nTo update an expired podcast, right-click on its name (not one episode but the group name) and choose \"Update Podcast\" and it will grab the latest one and reset the counter.\nAs you note, though, it's an irritating problem. The goal, I'm sure, is to protect the bandwidth of the various podcasters: if there are thousands (or more!) of people downloading them and never listening to them, the podcaster still has to pay for serving the files for no reason.\nMy solution -- which is only an option if you listen on an iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad -- is to use the app InstaCast which not only keeps podcasts current on your device but also allows you to download or stream any you don't have, even over a 3G connection with big files. My iTunes frustration has been significantly reduced as a result.\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to turn that message off. There is a few things that I am trying out to see if the message won't show up again. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click Settings…\n\n*\n\n*set it to Check for new episodes every day.\n\n*Settings for: Podcast Defaults.\n\n*When New episodes are available: Download All.\n\n*Episodes To Keep: All Episodes.\n\n\n*Click the Refresh button (next to the settings button).\n\n*Click on ANY podcast, and select all — ⌘ cmd / ctrl + A\n\n*With all the podcasts selected\n\n*\n\n*right click & choose Update podcast.\n\n\n*Select all again\n\n*\n\n*and in the same right click menu, select Do not Auto Delete.\n\n\n*Select all again\n\n*\n\n*and in the same right click menu, click Mark As Played/Watched.\n\n\n*Expand every podcast\n\n*\n\n*make sure you select Get All, if they have not been downloaded.\n\n\n*Quit iTunes, and relaunch it.\n\n\nDo all of this every day. I am concerned that iTunes won't save the library file and other settings if I don't relaunch iTunes every day.\nSo pretty much whenever there is a blue dot or whatever indicating you have unwatched/unlistened podcasts, simply select \"Mark as played\" and hopefully it will keep updating the podcasts by itself. If you are still concerned, move the podcast files in another place… perhaps to an external hard drive. This way if you are too busy to watch podcasts for a while, but still would like to watch them later, you will know for sure that they are safe and iTunes has not eaten them!\n\nA: I think is as simple as changing the podcast setting to store all podcast forever, and download when new ones are available. I have the options for each podcast set to that, and this has never happened.\n", "Q: Multiple skype instances on iphone Is is possible to run multiple instances of skype client on an iphone.\nI would like to be able to to login to two separate skype accounts and have the run simultaneously. \nIs it possible?\nFor instance, if there was an unofficial skype client, I could install it along the official one with different user name.\n\nA: Not possible with the official Skype App. \nRunning unofficial Skype client is possible, but recently Skype changed the rules and pushed out third parties, running Skype gateways (like Fring).\n", "Q: open new terminal tab in the same directory with the active tab In GNOME Terminal of Ubuntu when you open a new tab the new shell will automatically start you in the current working directory of the active tab shell.\nE.g. if in the active tab shell I am on ~/myproject and I open a new tab, the new shell will start on ~/myproject too.\nAs you can guess, this is very convenient when you work deep in the directory hierarchy.\nCan I configure the OSX terminal to have this behaviour? \nIf not, is there any free (cocoa) terminal that does this?\n\nA: You may use iTerm2 and just select in preferences to \"reuse previous tab's directory\"\n\n\nA: In recent OS X versions (Mavericks and Yosemite, not sure about earlier versions) in the Terminal.app preferences, \"General\" tab, there are options for \"New windows open with\" and \"New tabs open with\":\n\n\nA: Here's my solution from a SuperUser question\n\nGet the current environment in your clipboard:\nenv | pbcopy\n\nOpen up a new Terminal window and export those environment variables\nfor env in `pbpaste`; do export $env; done\n\nAnd to ease the process, you could always alias it, like so\nalias get_env=\"env | pbcopy\"\nalias set_env=\"for env in `pbpaste`; do export $env; done\"\n\nSo that all you have to do is\n\nget_env ⌘+N set_env\n\n\nThe accepted solution:\n#!/bin/sh \nosascript <<END \ntell app \"Terminal\" to do script \"cd \\\"`pwd`\\\"\" \nEND\n\nPlace it in one of the folders in your path, make it executable (chmod +x filename).

About once a year, like clockwork, the standard Apple iPhone headphones will start to crap-out on me.  Audio will flake out in a channel, the clicker will stop answering the phone, and ultimately they'll give up the ghost.  The flaking out is an audio-on/audio-off thing, eventually becoming a completely off thing.  This is not the schmutz in the iphone problem. \nI think I've tracked down the physical defect (but am not a headphone/electrical engineer) \n\nThe image above shows two flakey headphone jacks with their protective covering pulled back.  It looks like, over time, the plastic covering wears away and exposes the bare wires which, I assume, interferes with the magic that makes the headphone work. \nIs there a way to salvage these headphones? How can I keep this from happening to future headphones?  Will that happen to all microphone-clicker headphones, or are there's others that will be more resilient?  Are there low budget third-party headphones with comparable average audio-quality, a clicker, and will work with a first gen iPhone? I've been wary of trading up lest I'm buying for a new $100 pair of headphones every year (instead of a $30/pair).  Is it the design of the iPhone itself that causes this (i.e., something that won't happen with the newer models)\nWhen I'm not using the headphones they get wrapped up in my pocket like this. Is this damaging them? You can also see how the base of the jack casing has split.  This is something else that happens to the headphone.\n\nMy goal here is to make my headphones last as long as they can.\n\nA: My solution was to get a Shure mic/clicker (about $30-40) and combine it with a pair of sony headphones from amazon.  The shure is a really good mic has lasted and lasted and lasted, and the headphones while only $10 sound much better than the apple ones, and when they crap out (about 1.5-2 yrs) are a trivial expense.  It's a little more unwieldy than the all in one unit but it's much more durable and cheaper in the long run.  I originally did this to get around the nonstandard headphone jack on the 1st gen iphone, but now I stay with it because it's so reliable\n\nA: You might want to invest in some rugged earbuds next time.  These were very hard to find and took buying one brand of rugged earbuds, having them eaten by my husky (not rugged enough I guess), and Googling for hours thereafter for a better replacement; I didn't like the sound quality of the husky-destroyed set.  I've had the problem of sweat (from working out) thrice ruining the Apple brand earbuds and both the above linked sets claim to resist that issue and so far with my experience that's the case.  I can personally attest that both sets have a fully functioning iPhone remote and mic.\nAlso, just a note for regular care of any \"corded\" electronic (be that earbuds or your MacBooks power adapter) - never tightly coil the cord when prepping it for storage. The cord should be loosely \"folded\" back and forth creating a bow-tie-like shape. Tight coiling fatigues the cord too quickly. In reference to your photo - I would elongate those folds by double and would not have the tight, middle wrap.\n\nA: I had my headset from iPhone 3G presenting about the same problems last year (but they didn't looked so destroyed, just stopped working buttons and one side). So I sent them to warranty and got new ones back, after a month or so. I trust it only took a month because I'm in Brazil and things here can be really slow due to a gazillion reasons not only related to bureaucracy and mostly not really apple's fault. That can earn you an extra year of a new working phone, but not more than that since the warranty isn't renewed.\nAnd I agree the phones quality is suboptimal given their cost (converting from current exchange rate, equivalent to U$60 in official stores around here). So, unless you can find the original ones for cheap, it is a good idea to look for alternatives. Just beware the headset buttons don't have only one standard among them so be sure to double check the functionality you desire. On my checklist it has to stop / play / answer / hang up / double-click-next-song both on the iPhone and mac.\nIn my next headset acquisition, I will take few hours of research on http://ebay.com, http://dealextreme.com, http://google.com/products and local stores to find the best deal.\n", "Q: iOS Developer Tools & Utilities (must haves and nice to haves) I'm new to Mac's in general and iOS development.

Nothing necessarily wrong with Macports, but I don't like having 3 copies of Perl on my system, etc.\n\nA: Flux\nNot specifically development related, but I love it. This utility automatically adjusts the color temperature of your display based on sun rise & sun set in your specific location. Really makes working late at night more enjoyable. Try it for a few days and then disable it one night and you will not believe you used to be able to work without it.\nIt doesn't effect screen shots, etc. but you may need to disable it to get a true impression of the colors.\n\nA: Accessorizer\nAccessorizer speeds up the creation of all the boilerplate code you need to get your Mac or iOS app running.\nI guess the main use it to create @property and @synthesize lines. You simply select all your ivars press some keys and accessorizer will create a block of @property directives. Just paste that into your header and done.  \nBesides that you can create init, dealloc, viewDidUnload methods. It helps to create NSCoding compliant objects. And much more. \nEvery Objective-C developer should have it. \n\nA: Evernote\nNot programming related, but invaluable for storing notes, etc. Anything that doesn't go in your source control. Automatically syncs between computers and has great search functionality. I use it to put notes on my iPad.\n\nA: Tower\nGood and promising GIT front-end.\n\nA: Adobe Photoshop\nYes, it's expensive, but having a good graphics editing program is invaluable when making apps. Imagery is what makes an app stand out and even if you've hired that super expensive graphic designer, you're going to want to be able to make tweaks yourself.\nYou have several purchasing options, including a trial, or if you qualify, education pricing. \n\nA: MacVim\nMore mac-like way to use vim/gVim on the mac.\n\nA: SvnX\nSvnX is an OS X open source GUI for most features of the svn client binary.\nIt allows you to browse your working copies, spot changes and operate on them but also to browse logs and revisions of your repositories.\n\nA: MindNode\nGreat mind mapping utility. There is also an iPad version available ($7 or so)\n\nA: Macports\nNot really a Utility or often used tool by itself. But a great way to install all those unix command line tools that some of us need occasionally. For example imagemagick, pngcrush, mercurial, git, vim, wireshark and so on. \nFink is an alternative to Macports which basically does the same thing.\n\nA: mogenerator\nGenerates (and updates) Objective-C code for custom Core Data classes.\n\nA: BBEdit\nBBEdit is a great text editor that has been around for quite a while. The new version 10 not only added a ton of great new features (and continues to do so), but also saw a big reduction in price - about 50%. \nBBEdit is very scriptable, including AppleScript and shell scripting. Also easy to create clippings to reduce time. \nBBEdit is very similar to TextWrangler (TW is almost the 'lite' version of BBEdit), but includes many extra features that are well worth the money. Some examples are much better HTML tools, context aware auto complete in many different languages, clippings, SVN/CVS integration, and more. \n\nA: Pixelmator\nA good image editor is essential for development. Pixelmator is more than that. It is fully functional, complete with content-aware fill, has a beautiful Mac feel to it, and to top it off is only $25 (I am aware of the rules but this is one of its major selling points) in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Cornerstone\nIMHO - The best SVN client for Mac OS, but a little pricey.\n\nA: Ingredients\nIt's been in beta for ages and is very crashy on Lion, but Ingredients is a great alternative for browsing Xcode documentation. It's generally faster for searching the docs, and has Google and StackOverflow searches built in. I wish they'd update it so that it crashes less.\n\nA: Sip\nSip is the best color picker you can have on OS X in my opinion. It's lightweight, always active, and outputs the color picked in a variety of formats, (Cocoa, iOS, Web Hex, etc). It's using just a small icon on your top bar, and by pressing that it let's you pick a color from anything in your screen and copies the result in your clipboards. And it's free.\n\nA: CocoaPods\nCocoaPods is very useful to integrate 3th party libraries in your Xcode project. No more hassle and losing time with manual linking these libraries.\n\nA: Dropbox\nNot programming related, but invaluable for everything that doesn't go in source control. While Evernote is document centric, Dropbox is file centric. If you need files on multiple computers with revision control then you need Dropbox.\n\nA: Terminal\nThe terminal on your Mac is a very useful tool for managing repositories if you don't want to go the graphical route. Additionally, many useful Objective-C libraries are hosted on Google Code or GitHub. Having Terminal means being able to check out copies of these libraries.\n\nA: TestFlight\nIndispensable for managing over-the-air beta testing.\n\nA: TextWrangler\nAnother lightweight programmers text editor. \n\nA: Kaleidoscope\nA great diff/merge tool. Can compare images. Integrates seamlessly with almost anything.\n\nA: MonoDevelop\nA different IDE for working with Mono applications for the Mac (or cross platform). Mono is based on the .NET Framework and you can use it with C#, VB.NET or Delphi Prism (requires 3rd party addition). Possibly other languages too.\nCan be used with the MonoMac or MonoTouch frameworks to create native UI on Mac or iOS applications respectively.\n\nA: Find Any File\n(Available in the App Store)\nThe Mac's content centric \"Spotlight\" feature will first drive you mad as you realize it cannot be set to default to file name searches. Its inability to return results from invisible folders, such as usr/bin will then make your life a living hell.\n\"Find Any File\"  looks for FILES on the disk or folder you point it at. It doesn't care if Steve Jobs, or anyone else, thinks a file should be hidden from mere mortals. It'll even look inside packages.\n\nA: Fraise\nLightweight text editor with syntax highlighting, etc. My Notepad++ replacement. Development has stopped, but it is open source, so it may take off again.\n\nA: Versions\nElegant source control browser.\n\nA: Beanstalk\nSecure source control hosting platform. \n\nA: AppStar\nIf you've taken the time to develop and application you're going to need a way to analyze the result of your hard work. The nice thing about this app is that it consolidates your iTunes Connect reports, tracks sales, rankings, reviews and also keeps an eye on the competition. I'm not much of a \"business\" person, so it's definitely helpful.\n\nA: Quicklook Plugin for Mobile Provision files\nMacMation (developers of the TimeBoxed app) just posted a handy Quicklook plugin for viewing the contents and validity of Xcode's mobile provision files.\n\nA: Snippets\nSnippets is an application for Mac OS X that stores the most often-used pieces of your code you can reuse in different projects.\n\nA: Sizes\nAmazing app to resize retina images. Very useful for iOS/MacOSX app development.\n\nA: SQLiteManager\nIf you have to work with SQLite databases, or even just poke around the SQLite that Core Data produces, this is a great app. There's an unrelated Firefox add-on called SQLite Manager (notice the space) which has the great advantage of being free, but isn't as easy to use.\n\nA: Unretiner\nAn automated tool to get the 2 versions of icons, images etc for both Hi and Low resolution screen versions (used on the retina screen and not-retina screen devices)\nUsefull for iOS development.\n\nA: On The Job\nOn The Job is a really well done time tracking app. It's useful if you do client work and want to keep track of how much time you spend on a project. You can put in your hourly rate and (I think) generate invoices.\nI use it to check how long a task has taken, and as an anti-procrastination device. It's helpful to know that a task you thought would take 4 hours only took 40 minutes. If you forget to stop it when you go on a break, it notices and asks if you really want to bill for the empty time or just reset to where you left off. It's a little expensive, but gets updated pretty frequently.\n\nA: ClipMenu\nA free clipboard manager that is highly customizable and also includes support for snippets. I have it open a list of recently copied items using alt+space and then I can select an item to paste from the list. I recommend spending some time to customize it to your specific workflow.\n\nA: StoreSizer\nStoreSizer is an easy to use and free Mac OS X application that will allow you to quickly resize your AppStore 512*512 PNG icons to icons that can be used for your application.\n\nA: Status Barred\nStatus Barred crops your iOS screenshots to remove the status bar from them, which is recommended by apple before submitting to iTunes connect.\n\nA: Keystok for iOS\nAn elegant developer tool to manage all your iOS app configs. Helps manage API keys and other secrets in your source code at a central place. \nPS: I am part of the Keystok team.\n\nA: SupportKit\nFree SDK that allows you to have conversations with users in your app, from the comfort of your e-mail inbox. I helped build it and am really proud of the impact it's having on apps everywhere.\n", "Q: AirPort Express orange yellow light problem and not discoverable at all My AirPort Express is showing a permanent orange light. Every ~5 minutes it blinks green once and after this I get continuos yellow.\nThe AirPort device is connected via LAN to my Linksys WRT-160NL router that is configured with DHCP enabled - is supposed to give and IP to the AirPort.\nThe AirPort is undiscoverable via LAN or WiFi.\nIf I try the hard reset procedure, all I get is flashing yellow led after few seconds but no other effects.\n\nA: Is it older than a year? AE power supplies eventually fail due to internal heat.  At least one failure mode - the one I recently observed - is just as you described it.  If I kept trying, I'd occasionally get a green light and Airport Utility would discover it long enough for me to set a configuration, but it would soon fail again and go back to a slow-blinking yellow light.  It would happen just often enough to keep me trying to revive it, but I finally let it go after sinking a couple of hours into it. At least in the US, if it is being used with a system that has AppleCare coverage, I believe the AE will be covered too. I hope that option is open to you.\n\nA: Take a look at the status codes article over on Apple's site.\n\nSolid yellow - There was an issue starting up. AirPort Express will restart in 60 seconds.\n\n\nA: This is not a permanent solution, but I have had considerable success by placing the Airport Express in a ziplock bag and leaving it in the refrigerator anywhere from thirty minutes to several hours. \nOnce I plug it back in, the router works fine for many hours.\nAs @JRobert answers it's very likely overheating, but this can push back the upgrade/replacement date for quite a while.\n\nA: My AE will go to solid amber from green after operating for a period of time, usually an hour or so.  I unplug the power source for 20 seconds and  plug back in.  It will reboot (slowly) and return to green for another hour or so of normal operation.  I do not notice a difference in the amber mode operation.\n\nA: This is going to sound totally ridiculous and fake, but it is not. Be sure to have tried all other solutions first. \nBut then drop it from 1.5 meters onto carpet, on the side with the connections.\nThis has fixed the problem for me and countless others, as you can read here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4031394\nAfter 4 hours of troubleshooting I was ready to throw it in the trash. Without much to lose I dropped it and it works again, orange light turned green and the Airport Express (first generation, A1264) was visible again in the network and Airport configuration app.\n", "Q: Why am I getting a \"session could not be started with the iPad\" error when syncing? This morning while trying to sync my iPad I started getting the following error from iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes could not backup iPad because a session could not be started with the iPad\n\n\nI've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the iPhoto cache \"com.apple.iPhoto.plist\" (might be corrupt)\n\n*Running the Repair Disk Permissions from Disk Utility\n\n*Delete existing backup (might be corrupt)\n\n*Backing it up to a new account (same Mac)\n\n*Different sync cable\n\n*Different USB port\n\n*Rebooting the Mac and the iPad\n\n*Turning off Photo sync\n\n\nSo far, no luck. Still getting the error when trying to sync or backup my iPad. The iPhone 4 syncs fine. Running Verify Disk Permissions after the Repair still reported issues, but none of them seemed to be in any directories related to iTunes (all Java related).\nFYI, it starts trying to backup, but fails at around 90%. So it would seem it has a \"session started\", but fails part way through.\nUPDATE: I was listening to Pandora while my iPad charged and functioned as my AirDisplay when all of a sudden my iPad started rebooting repeatedly (not syncing or updating, checked iTunes.) It kept rebooting until I removed the sync cable. When it came back then it backed-up and synced fine. I'll leave this question open in case someone has any suggestions. If no one has any suggestions then I will probably delete it.\n\nA: OK, I cabled my iPhone and synced. After doing that, I unchecked the sync using Wi-Fi. I then applied the change. Then, I checked sync using Wi-Fi and unplugged my phone. I then synced using Wi-Fi. It worked for me. Hope it does for someone else.\n\nA: This happened again, and here are the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete existing backup\n\n*Restart iTunes\n\n*Restart iPad\n\n*Sync\n\n\nIt seems to be caused by canceling the sync during the backup. I might try it again to see if those are the steps to fix it.\n\nA: I deleted iPod photo cache. No change.\nI performed iPad hard reset. No change.\nI pulled up applications menu (double menu button click) and then clicked the \"minus\" icon for every single App until they were all removed from the list.\nSync then worked perfectly.\nThe problem appeared to be that backups were being prevented by one of the Apps I had \"open\" in the background.\n\nA: I had this problem too but I found out it was caused by stopping a backup in progress. To solve, just quit iTunes completely and power off your iPad, then relaunch iTunes and turn your iPad back on.\n\nA: it seems that when this message \"iTunes could not backup iPad because a session could not be started with the iPad\" popped out, your itunes was actually backing up/restoring from your back up data. It happened to me also, then my ipad suddenly rebooted and then it was restored from the backup data\n\nA: There are items I've seen cause this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The device is not working properly. Shutting it down with a slide to power off usually remedies this temporary situation on the device.\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\n*~/Library/Lockdown\n\n*/private/var/db/lockdown\n\n\nDo be sure to make a backup before deleting files from locations 2-4 and I like to delete them and then reboot the mac to allow the programs to recreate the lockdown files as needed. You are removing all backups by deleting items from #2 above - use caution.\n", "Q: TimeMachine with multiple disks (one at a time) I have backed up my Mac to an external disk using TimeMachine. When I plug in a different external disk the Mac still expects to backup to the first disk. Is it possible to backup to two external disks, one at a time?\n\nA: You just have to select both disks as backup disks from Time Machine Pref pane, one at a time.\nEdit:\n\nAttach your first drive, open the Time Machine system preference, click the Select Disk button, and choose the attached drive as the backup destination. Initiate a backup and wait until it’s done.\nNow attach the other drive, open the Time Machine system preference yet again, click Select Disk, and choose the new drive as the backup destination. Again, wait for the backup to complete. You now have two identical backups.\n\nTaken from Macworld Article\n\nA: Actually, this have changed with Mountain Lion, and now the answer is very simple:\nYou can backup both at same time! \\o/\n\nA: Assuming you're trying to have two or more rotating backup sets, there's another method which may be more convenient (taken from this macosxhints forum post):\n\n\n*\n\n*First set up a RAID 1 between the two disks, using Disk Utility.\n\n*Set the RAID set as your Time Machine target drive, and let it do a full backup.\n\n*Unmount the RAID set, unplug one of the drives. Re-mount the other drive. The RAID set will now be running in \"degraded\" state, meaning it only has one drive.\n\n*Take your other drive and put it somewhere safe.\n\n*After a week, or whatever period, bring the off-site drive back, connect it, and let the RAID re-build.\n\n*Repeat steps 3-6.\n\n\nI've just recently started this plan, and rebuilding a 2TB RAID takes a really, really long time: roughly 40 hours.\n", "Q: MDS Error: /var/folders/lM I've been getting this error coming up in my system log.  Having looked around for an answer, two things came up commonly: a problem with the spotlight database(s), and permissions on those folders.\nWell, I played with permissions and even deleted some of the folders in question to see if they would be re-created properly.  I think that was a mistake, there were odd side effects, so I tried my best to restore the folders to the way they had been previously.\nAlso, resetting MDS didn't help much.  Most recently the error comes up when Outlook refuses to get my mail properly.\nIt's also always followed by Quicklook-related errors as well.\n\n\nA: From Apple Support Communities, with some correction:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-S at startup for Single User Mode\n\n*Repair the files ystem as indicated on screen using fsck (took three runs)\n\n*Mount the file system as indicated on screen, /sbin/mount -uw /\n\n*Go to /Library/Caches and do rm -rf *\n\n*Go to my home folder /Users/.../Library/Caches and do rm -rf *\n\n*Remove a Spotlight folder, rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100\n\n*Go to /var/folders and do rm -rf *\n\n*Start normally using exit or reboot command as indicated on screen\n\n\nBe extremely careful with the rm -rf commands!

We have 2 iPhones and 2 iPads synced to iTunes. It seems that to delete an app, I need to delete it from all devices individually and iTunes - i.e. 5 deletes. Is there a better way to do this?\n\nA: Not sure which iTunes version you have installed but as of 10.2, once I deleted an app from the app list in iTunes, the app is deleted from all iOS devices the next time they're connected and synced.\n", "Q: Manage local emails on two Mac computers I use Outlook for Mac on my iMac and my Macbook (that I use when I travel).\nDue to storage limitations in my employers Exchange servers, I need to store emails locally (as well on the server).\nIs there any ways to have access to the locally stored emails on both my iMac and MacBook? Easy ways prefered ...\n\nA: I would suggest using Gmail's powerful IMAP features to keep your emails synced on both computers. \nI have set this up for lots of people and it works great.\nGet a Gmail account and go to settings - Accounts and Import.\nYou will have to set it up to check mail using POP3 and enter your mail server settings.  Next set up Send mail as choose Send mail from another address then put your outgoing smtp settings.\nNext go to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab and enable IMAP and click on the Configuration instructions and it will give you the settings to enter into Apple Mail.\nOnce your Apple Mail is set up on both computers it will keep all your messages synced.  You can also set it up on your iphone or Android.\n\nA: I can't think of a simple way to do this.  You could share your Mail folder on one of the machines and create a link to it on the other machine - or you could involve another email server.  I would do the latter.  Get an IMAP emil account, even a gmail or better yet a google apps account.  Add the email address (using IMAP,) at work, and when you need to move stuff onto the local machine due to storage restriction, instead of moving it onto the local machine, move it into your IMAP account.  It will be sync'd since IMAP does syncing natively.  All you'd have to do then is set up the IMAP account on the other computer as well.\n", "Q: Repair Bent Unibody Case Mac Book Pro 15\" I dropped my 15\" MacBook Pro off of the couch onto hardwood floor (a drop of about 24 inches). It works fine still, but the bottom part (not the LCD) has bent inwards as a result. So if you are looking at the laptop with your eyes at desk-level the left hand side of the case is bent in a few millimeters on the bottom. This warping has caused the bottom-panel (the big panel screwed into the bottom) to jut out slightly.\nI talked to Apple and they said that this sort of damage isn't covered by any warranty, and all they could do is replace the entire lower unibody frame for something like $600.\nDoes anyone know if there are Mac repair shops that will bend a unibody frame back into shape? Is there a reliable national chain that offers this? An online repair shop that you would trust mailing your laptop to? Tips on locating a local shop that might do this sort of work?\n\nAlso, I live in the S.F. Bay Area so if anyone knows personally of a repair shop that does this sort of thing, that would be awesome to know as well.\n\nA: I could not recommend you any service, but here is my story.\nI was almost the same situation about a year ago. I decided to replace the \"top-case\" which is the keyboard actually. I've got the old bended part and later it was easy to bend it back to it's original shape (it's really elastic aluminum) by myself.\nThe sad thing that the whole inside should be screwed out and back to replace the \"top-case\". So it's not an easy job, they even shortcut something at first time at the Apple service.\nThe bottom part which is just an aluminum plate can be easily bended back at home.\n\nA: Bummer to hear about the accident. I see stuff like that every day because I manage an Apple Authorized Service Provider in Chicago. We never bend anything back into place, but rather replace the part(s). I believe that most others would do the same. Depending on the exact model our rates are typically less than the Apple store. \nSending your machine halfway across the country may not sound appealing, but I do know of another AASP located in Santa Clara.

How can I check my line-in does work? \nI'm interesting what software should I use and how.\nIt is MBP, late 2010. I do have an external working mic.\n\nA: *\n\n*Launch System Preferences… from the Apple menu.\n\n*Click on Speech.\n\n*The left tab is marked Speech Recognition.\n\n*Set the Microphone from the default \"Internal microphone\" to \"Line In\".\n\n*Click on the Calibrate button. Then speak the phrases on the left e.g. \"What Time Is It?\"\n\n\nIf your Mac detects your line-in, you'll see the blue-green-red indicator respond to the volume of your voice from the line-in.\nHave fun, and don't forget to mark the question as answered when you're done. Cheers.\n\nA: You could try using LineIn.app from rogueamoeba. It allows to pass-through audio from line-in to speakers (normally disabled in Mac OS X). I did use this app quite a few times to play music from external source. Should do the trick for you.\n", "Q: Default exchange calendar on iPhone (Google Sync) I am using Google Sync to connected various calendars between my Google account and my iPhone. Some of these calendars are subscribed to calendars (national holidays/sporting events etc). When I go to create a new calendar entry on my iPhone it always selects the national holidays calendar, rather than my own, is there a way of setting my own calendar to be the default?\n\nA: In the calendar settings inside the settings app (Mai, Contacts, Calendars) at the bottom of that menu there is an option to set the Default Calendar. I'm thinking it's set to National Holidays at the moment so you can just change it there so all new entries should reside in the default calendar.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Why do some calendar events shift in time when daylight saving time goes into effect? Recently the UK changed from winter time to summer time, I have noticed that the timing of some of my calendar appointments (Google Calendar via Google Sync) have also been shifted forwards by an hour, whereas some have not changed.\nIt could well be that the split is down to events created on the iPhone and those created on the Google Calendar web interface.\nDoes anyone know a work around for this, that will stop me turning up an hour early to things when the clocks change back in October?\n\nA: You may be able to fix it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings on your iPhone\n\n*Select \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\"\n\n*Scroll down to the Calendars section\n\n*Select \"Time Zone Support\"\n\n*Turn on Time Zone support\n\n\nOr maybe you want to turn time zone support off? It's a little confusing. Here's what Apple says:\n\nWhen Time Zone Support is on, Calendar displays event dates and times in the time zone set for your calendars. When Time Zone Support is off, Calendar displays events in the time zone of your current location.\n\n\nA: Time zones are a bit tricky with phones and the settings are not obvious since they are spread in several places. Also complicating the issue is the introduction of \"Floating Time Zone\" support. The idea of an event in iOS and on mac is that a floating event will happen at 5PM based on the time zone the phone is currently in. \nI'm not a power user of Google Calendar, but you should be able to see it and clean things up on the Google web interface to change the events with issues to be relative time or DST or absolute time. I've had good luck doing this by subscribing to the calendar in iCal, exporting the calendar. Figure a fix and then replace the bad data with good from the computer.\nIt's entirely likely the iPhone sent new appointments in a format that Google interpreted as fixed offset (or absolute time) instead of a DST offset.\n\nA: This happened to me\nIt's explained in a David Pogue blog at the New York Times web site.\nThis only covers the iPhone side of the problem, not the Google Calendar side, but I suspect it's involved in your problem. With my iPod touch, it's my responsibility to manually change the time (whether crossing a time zone like we do frequently in the USA, or with Daylight Savings Time going on or off). Syncing my iPod with my Mac does not necessarily change the time zone automatically.\n\nA: There are a lot of possible answers, but to isolate the cause, find two events, one that moved and one that didn't. Export them, and look at the calendar data. In all likelihood, the time zone embedded in event can explain why happened.\nIf you want to do this, I'll try to walk you thru gathering the data. \n(I don't have a ready answer because I don't work on calendar products anymore, I used to have most of the edge cases memorized...)\n", "Q: How can I change sound depth and frequency characteristics in GarageBand? How can I change depth (bits) and frequency (kHzs) characteristics when recording session in GarageBand?\nIf I can't then what are the default values?\n\nA: You cannot change depth and frequency of the recorded samples, even when changing the input settings in the Audio MIDI Setup.app (this is the way to change playback and recording settings for sound devices).\n\nThe default values for Garage Band are 44kHz, 16 bit, stereo. They are kept in AIFF format. You can explore them by right-clicking your garage band project and choosing Show package contents. The recorded files are kept in the Media folder.\nEdit (added Logic 9):\nIn Logic 9 you can change the sampling rate (frequency) from the Project Settings window, Audio tab. Explained in the Logic 9 Manual - Setting the Sample rate. To change the bit depth you should go to Preferences -> Audio and check/uncheck 24 bit recording (It's checked by default).

I'm new to Macs and got a 2011 MacBook Pro a few weeks ago and when I first set it up there was an American Flag on my menu bar.  Somehow it has disappeared and I can't figure out how to get it back.\n\n\nA: in the Language and Text, under Input source, you need to select one or more input sources; you also need to select Keyboard and Character Viewer on the top of the input source list.\nAs far as I know, the flag is displayed only when you select more than one input source; differently, the icon you see is a generic one.\nThis is the icon you see when just an input source is selected.\n\nThis is the icon you see when you selected two or more input sources; in this case, the selected input source is \"Italian Pro.\"\n\n\nA: You have to go to your system preferences and go to language and religion or language and text. When you get there you will see a small button in the bottom that says keyboard preferences, when you get there you can choose your languages and you will have the small flag.\n", "Q: Why on iPad or iPhone, the $0.99 click is so easy, but to download my purchased songs, it is so XYZ tough? I bought a song on iTunes on my iPad, but the song is greyed out. How can I get the song back?\nAlso, how can I download the song to my iPad or iPhone?\n\nA: I believe if the song is present on your iPad/iPhone library it will be grayed out in iTunes (on iOS) probably the purchased playlist?\nIn regards to that downloading again without repurchasing, ONLY applications purchased can be re-downloaded for free without repurchasing. Songs and audiobooks require you to re-purchase. This is because the record companies have explicitly stated this in their agreement to Apple. Whoever told you that information was wrong.\nHowever, if you email Apple, you can request to restore all downloads. This means everything you bought will be available for download again (except some that have changed name or have been removed from iTunes store) but do note that this can be used one time only. It's for people who had their laptop stolen and lost everything or a broken hard drive with loss of data.\nHope that clears things up.\n\nA: As of the release of iTunes in the Cloud, it has become much easier to re-acquire media that was previously purchased from iTunes.\nWith regard to the question, there is now a Purchased tab in the iTunes app on iOS, which allows you to find and re-download any song, movie, tv show, or book that you have previously purchased with your iTunes account on any device.\nIt is worth noting that this feature may not be available in all countries, or that the availability of any given piece of media may differ between countries (up until recently, one could only re-download music and TV in Canada, for example, but not movies).\n", "Q: High processor/CPU load on iPhone, draining battery, how to fix? My iPhone sometimes gets very hot and drains battery extremely quickly. When I use the app iStat to check processor load, it shows high numbers (above 2, where it is normally 0.5, not sure about the format of those numbers but that is what is reported). It seem to be the equivalent of a computer stuck at 100% CPU load.\nRestarting the iPhone and closing all apps does not help. Previously, it went away after a number of restarts, but this time, so far not. Do you know a way, except re-installing, that can fix the iPhone? Any app that can kill all processes?\n\nA: Do you use Exchange on your iPhone? At our company we have some trouble with contact sync every once in a while. Various iPhones will run at 80% CPU and their batteries empty in about 2 hours.\nOne temporary fix is to turn off contacts in Exchange Settings and turn it on again. Then contacts will be sync again and after this CPU runs at a normal 5-15%.\n\nA: I had exactly this problem on my a little over one year old iPhone 4. The battery was draining in like 4 hours and the CPU was working overtime all the time. \nAll i did was a backup and then a restore in iTunes. It worked perfectly. The battery drained less than a percent in the following four hours! \nI'm trying to figure out if it was any particular app that was causing the problem by uninstalling some of the later ones.\n\nA: iPhone 3GS, iPad(3G 3rd generation), & iPod Touch(4G 4th generation) were all getting terrible battery life after iOS 6 update.\nSolution for me was to turn off Push for email and other network features.  This brought battery life back to where it was before the iOS6 upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, and Calendars > Fetch New Data\n\n*Disable push e-mail and set \"Fetch\" to manual.\" \n\n\nTaken from this article with other good tips as well but for me the key was turning off Push as this essentially seems to keep the phone active and connected constantly.\n\nA: A great app (free) from the engineering department at UC Berkeley has been released specifically for debugging problems such as this.\nIt's available through the app store so does not require jailbreaking.\nThe method involves running the app for several days to a week. During that time it logs the energy usage of the various apps that you are running.\nYou can then see which are the energy hogs that are causing the problem.\nhttp://carat.cs.berkeley.edu\n\nA: It is usually an app that goes haywire and reinstalling the app will usually do the trick. \n\nA: There's no official way to close apps other than invoke que \"task switcher\" (by double clicking on the home button) and press+hold one of the apps, then closing them individually.

That's the only way to do it. \nIf -after all that- you still have a process that's bothering your iPhone's then you'll have to re-install it, because it will have to be an application that was installed by Apple and therefore there isn't much you can do about it.\nReinstalling ought to normalize the situation and you can always restore a backup (but make sure things work ok first).\nNow if there's a method in the Jailbreak world I don't know, but I'm sure there is a \"task manager\" in Cydia. \n\nA: As others already let clear, Apple doesn't offer any good solution for those issues. They shouldn't exist, Apple would say. But they do.\nThat said, your best bet is jailbreaking and getting SBSettings to \"Free Memory\" or some specific app that does it, such as MemTool.

There is no history for the tabs, ie, I can't click the Back button. \"Reopen all windows\" in the History menu does the same thing.\nFirefox and Chrome remember the entire session, so it's as if I never shut down. How do I get Safari to remember the actual session and not just the last page I looked at?\nSafari 5.0.4, 10.5.8\n\nA: Obviously this wasn't a solution at the time you asked the question, but if you're looking for more basic, it's now built into the latest version of the operating system.\nSafari in Lion does seem to remember the history for each tab when it restores on re-launch. If you were using 10.5.8 because you use PPC hardware, or don't want to buy the upgrade, this doesn't help, but it if Lion is a viable choice, it does seem to work very smoothly.\n", "Q: Can I connect the iPad 2 video out to an iMac? This is not a AirDisplay question, it's about the HDMI connection.\nI don't have a TV. I use my main computer, a 27\" iMac, for watching movies.\nThe iPad 2 has HDMI out and games can output to 1080p while using the iPad as a controller, as seen in the recent RealRacing HD announcement.\nDoes anybody know if it will be possible at all to use an iMac screen, and its mini display port, in place of HDMI out?\n\nA: Yes you can do it using an Active HDMI to MiniDisplay port adaptor like  this  but as you can see it's not cheap \n\nA: On the page edude05 linked, there is a \"Did You Notice?\" scroll which, frankly, I had not noticed before:\n\nDid You Notice?\nThe Mini DisplayPort connector on the\n  27-inch iMac supports input as well as\n  output, so you can connect to any\n  external source that has HDMI output\n  and use your iMac as a display.\n\nSo this implies that you can route video from the iPad through its HDMI output into the Mini DisplayPort on the iMac.\nBut if that's the case, why are the reviewers disparaging the 27\"?\n", "Q: What's the quickest way to get a graphic on the clipboard saved to disk?

Only thing left to do is save that file. Presto!\n\nA: Using Preview.app is a way, but a little cumbersome. It can also be done on the command line. \nBecause pbpaste can only pbpaste > filename text snippets, you want to use pngpaste instead. \nInstall it with Brew:\nbrew install pngpaste\n\nand use it: \npngpaste <filename>\n\n\nA: Not nearly as slick, but without using Preview.\nFinder -> Edit -> Show Clipboard\nCmd+Shift+4 to get the screen shot marquee tool, and copy the part of the clipboard you want.

The webpages each contain links, text, and photos. I would then like to place this information in a text document. \nDetailed steps would be much appreciated!\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: Automator, as an automation tool, is a bit of a sledgehammer, so the following is a bit clumsy, but works.\nAutomator provides two actions for choosing URLs: Get Specified URLs, that allows one to specify a pre-determined list of URLs, and Get Current Webpage from Safari, that specifies the URL of Safari's current webpage. It also provides three nice actions for parsing we webpages: Get Text from Webpage, Get Image URLs from Webpage and Get Link URLs from Webpages, which do what you would expect them to. Finally, Automator provides an action to place text in a document: Set Contents of TextEdit Document. You may also want to use the Get Specified Text action to separate the text, images, and links sections of your new TextEdit Document.\nHere is what your complete Automator workflow might look like:\nGet Specified Text --- Text of Webpage ---\nSet Contents of TextEdit Document using the \"by replacing\" option.\nGet Current Webpage from Safari\nGet Text from Webpage\nSet Contents of TextEdit Document using the \"by appending\" option.\nGet Specified Text --- Images URLs of Webpage ---\nSet Contents of TextEdit Document using the \"by appending\" option.\nGet Current Webpage from Safari\nGet Image URLs from Webpage\nSet Contents of TextEdit Document using the \"by appending\" option.\nGet Specified Text --- Link URLs of Webpage ---\nSet Contents of TextEdit Document using the \"by appending\" option.\nGet Current Webpage from Safari\nGet Link URLs from Webpages\nSet Contents of TextEdit Document using the \"by appending\" option.\nWhen this workflow finishes, there will be a new untitled TextEdit document open whose contents is text, image URLs and link URLs of Safari's current webpage. You can save it wherever you please.\n", "Q: Login Window not blacking out my screen? I use hot corners to lock my screen. \nSometimes, my login window appears but the screen behind it does not turn black. My desktop stays visible, but behind the Login window. \nWhy is this? Is there any way to fix it?\n\nA: I assume that you've selected \"Start Screen Saver\" in the hot-corner in question, correct?  \nIf so, what screen saver do you currently have configured?\nThe reason that I ask is that some screen savers (although none of the ones that come with your Mac) start with the current desktop image and then apply special effects to it over time.   So I can imagine if..\n\n\n*\n\n*you've configured your screensaver\nto    shuffle through screen savers,\nand\n\n*you have installed one of the\naforementioned screensavers,\n\n\n...that this combination could produce the kind of symptoms you are describing.\nEdit:  Interesting.  I don't even have \"Lock Screen\" as one of the choices on my machine:\n\n\nEdit 2:  I had never tried that option until now.   I set up my laptop (model identifier MacBookPro5,2, 2.93 Ghz) as you described and put the display to sleep with that hot corner and woke it up over & over again.  I went through about 50 iterations, and I was able to reproduce your problem 3 times in that span:  the display would appear to blank, but when it woke up I could see my desktop with the login panel overlayed.  \nBecause this kind of configuration involves invoking the special power-management circuitry in the machine, there are more moving parts that can go wrong in the process.  I believe you have little choice other than to report the problem to Apple, and even if there is a real bug, there will be a chance that the bug is in the power-management circuitry itself and the 'fix' might only come when you can buy a new machine.   Or not.  Maybe you could get lucky and there this could be fixed by a firmware update or a point-release of the OS.\nI like this option, now that you have pointed it out to me.  I like that it immediately puts the display to sleep, which makes me feel better about how my battery is being used.  Alas, if blanking the screen and keeping it from prying eyes is a higher priority, maybe you should use the \"Start Screen Saver\" option instead, and set the screensaver to something mostly black like the \"Computer Name\" screensaver.\nI wish I could offer more help.\n", "Q: Enhance Wifi range on a TimeCapsule I previously had a DLink modem-router (DSL-2740B). I replaced it with a small ADSL D-Link modem and a TimeCapsule.\nWhile I'm quite happy with it, the main and only criticism I could make is the loss I had in the Wifi coverage in my apartment.\nWhen I had an almost full signal in my bedroom with the DLink, I can now barely connect.\nI know that an Airport Extreme Base Station would be an option to extend the network but the distance from the TimeCapsule to the bedroom seems quite \"normal\" to me so that a single wifi emitter would be enough as it was before.\nI plan anyway to put in my bedroom an Airport Extreme Base station to dispatch my music collection on my hifi system, but I'm afraid it wouldn't even reach the network. \nAre there any tips and tricks?\nIn Airport Utility, the Transmit Power is already at 100%.\nAre there any other parameters to check/tweak?\n\nEDIT:\nHere is the screenshot of iStumbler. My network is highlighted.\n\n\nA: Run iStumbler from your Mac.  (Get it here). Look at the other wireless networks in your vicinity - and check what channel(s) they're running on.  You want your device to be as far away from those channels as possible.  There is a 3-channel overlap.  That means, a device on channel 1 will interfere (albeit only slightly,) with a device on channel 3 (or 4?  I forget.)  So if lots of devices are on channel 6 (most come out of the box on this channel,) you want to be on 9/10/11 or 3/2/1.  I almost always just use 1 or 11.\nThere is also a \"use network robustness\" option which I think increases range but decreases bandwidth.

At the end, diskutil list should show something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Plug this into your G5 Cube, and, at boot, press both ALT keys (theoretically one should work but with my wireless keyboard the both button approach works best)\n\n*You'll get a very primitive version of the present day Boot Selection screen, WHICH ONLY WORKS WITH A MOUSE ! There you'll find the USB Stick and be able to boot from it, and install as if it were a very speedy and silent DVD drive :)\nFor those wishing to install Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, the ISO floating around for that seems to contain a very small Apple_Driver_ATAPI partition (disk2s2 in step 4), a few KB instead of half a GB. This unfortunately seems to be incompatible with steps 1-6..\nThe workaround is the following: prepare a 10.5 Leopard USB stick, and overwrite the Apple_HFS partition with the Apple_HFS partition from the 10.4 Tiger disk:\n\n\n*Proceed with creating a Leopard 10.5 stick as in steps 1-4\n\n*Mount the OSX 10.4 Tiger image; it should look something like this:\n\n\n*With dd, copy over the Apple_HFS (disk3s3 or diskNs3) partition OVER the Apple_HFS (~7GB) on the stick. This will leave you with a stick having the ATAPI driver from the Leopard DVD disc, but the OS image of the Tiger disc. Through this method, I got it to show, and managed to install Tiger alongside Leopard xD. On my end, it looks like this:\n\nFor those wanting to install 10.3 or lower Unfortunately, I haven't found any way to get those to boot off of a USB device (not initially though).\nTo install 10.3 / 10.2 / 10.1 / 10.0, burn the CD1 image onto a disk, which you will have to be reading through the on-board IDE cable (connecting a USB cd-rom doesn't cut it, not USB allowed !). You'll install as per usual, pressing alt (both of them in case of the cube) at bootup, selecting the CD, installing ...\nYou'll at some point be asked to insert the 2nd disc - those you may prepare the same as a Tiger installation: make a Leopard disc, and overwrite the 3rd partition (the Apple_HFS one that occupies the most space) with the Apple_HFS partition of the CD2 of the pre 10.4 OS you're installing. This time the system will accept it and continue installing from the USB device.\n\nA: Powerbook G4 1.0Ghz 12\"\nExternal Pioneer/generic USB CD/DVD drive\nPlug into the rear-most USB port.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on\n\n*⌘ CmdOptOF\n\n*boot usb1/disk@1:,\\\\yaboot\n\n*Return ⏎\n\n*restart\nInstalls Ubuntu 16.04 PPC perfectly, first try.\nLove these old threads and old machines!\n", "Q: \"View In Mac App Store\" button in Firefox Does anyone know if it's possible to get the \"View In Mac App Store\" button on web based pages (e.g. http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jellyfissh/id416399476 ) to open the mac app store when using Firefox? It only seems to work in safari atm.\nMy specs:\nRunning Firefox 4 on OSX 10.6.7 on Macbook Pro\n\nA: It looks like Apple updated the code to detect which client you are when connecting to the app store.\nI checked and they have script that called a function its.detect.Itunes which detects what browser and operating system you are on, and if it isnt Safari, the link does not return an app store link.\nInterestingly it does seem to have handlers for chrome and firefox, but either they made a mistake or they are purposefully making it so you cannot use Firefox to one click browse the mac app store.\nI checked if switching firefox's user agent worked, and while it did load the page momentarily, and the function clearly had a anchor link instead of a direct href, it immediately redirects to a blankly loading page forever. \nAt this point it looks like it is probably safari or bust.\n\nA: I just got this working by overriding the useragent string.\n(tl;dr: There is a firefox plugin called User Agent Overrider which does what is detailed below. My reasons for not using the plugin is, that I find the below easy enough to do manually and don't do it often enough to warrant the need for a whole plugin in my already overladen-with-plugins Newmoon.)\nSteps (More detailed steps, as I found later, are available here):\n\n\n*\n\n*Check whether the 'View In Mac App Store' link works in Safari. If so, in Safari copy your useragent string by visting http://whatsmyuseragent.com/\n\n*Now back in firefox, open about:config in a new tab and right click to create a new string with preference name as general.useragent.override.apple.com and with the value as the useragent string you copied earlier (which in my case was Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_5) AppleWebKit/600.7.12 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.2.7 Safari/537.85.16)  (Look at 'A' in the following snapshot)     \n\n*When you are done, it should look like 'B' in the above snapshot \nNo need to restart the browser, refresh the page (for example: this) and try clicking on the 'View In Mac App Store'.\n", "Q: Send an application to a specific Space Is there a way to send the current used application to a specific Space?\nFor example, I work in Space 1; I double-click on a document and an application starts to open this document. Is there a quick way to send this application to Space 2?\n\nA: I don't think there's a particular kayboard shortcut you can use, but if you click on the app's title bar and hold mouse button and then click ctrl+n where n is the number of the screen you want to send it to it will be moved there. Bear in mind you will be moved there too.\n\nA: If you want to always use the same Space for an application, then you can assign it from the \"Esposé and Spaces\" preference panel.  \"Every spaces\" allows you to see the windows of that application in every spaces, independently  from the space where you opened that application.\n\nIf you want to move an application window from a Space to another, then click on the Spaces icon shown in the dock, and Spaces will show you all the available spaces; from that screen you can move a window between spaces.\n", "Q: How do I create a file with a custom file extension? I've just been trying to create a .crt file, so I can copy the contents (text) from a web page in to it, but Mac OS doesn't seem to want to let me do it easily.\nNormally in Windows I would right click > new file, or even open notepad and save as (as it lets you save with any extension), but TextEdit in mac forces me to save as RTF, and I seem to be unable to rename it in finder afterwards?!\nI ended up opening the terminal and executing touch cert.crt just to create the file. I need to explain this process to some other users - there must be a simpler way.\n\nA: I tried to recreate your Problem and noticed that you probably have not enabled the \"Show all File Extensions\" option in the Finder Preferences. \nYou can check by selecting the Finder and selecting \"Preferences\" from the Menubar. A small window should appear, titled \"Finder Preferences\". Select the \"Advanced\" Icon at the Top of that window. You should now see the option \"Show all File Extensions\", it should be checked. All files in your finder window should now show their extensions, like .txt or in your case .crt\nYou can now easily change all files to another extension.\nIf that does not work then the Fileextension is probably linked to another application. .crt-Files should link to the Keychain-Application which handels all certificates. You can check by selecting the crt-File and pressing \"command\" + \"i\". An information window should appear with additional information to that file. At the Entry \"open with\" should appear \"Keychain.app\".\n\nA: @J.C.'s answer is good advice, and will let you change the file extension, but it'll still be in RTF format and will not be useable as a certificate file.  To solve this, convert the document to plain text in TextEdit before saving it (Format menu > Make Plain Text).  When TextEdit has the document in plain text mode, it'll display in a monospace font, and the format bar will vanish from the window.  Most importantly, it'll now default to saving with a .txt extension but let you change that in the save dialog.  In the save dialog, there'll be a checkbox labelled \"If no extension is provided, use '.txt'.\" -- with that box selected, if you try to save as .crt it'll object but give you a \"Use .crt\" option; with it deselected, it won't even object.\n", "Q: Buy macbook pro 17 from amazon vs apple? I'm about to purchase the new macbook pro 17 from amazon.  $134 less than from Apple and no tax means almost $400 is saved...  amazon only has the base model without any upgrades, but that's what I wanted anyway.\nAny reason to spend the extra money and go with Apple directly?  Is there a better place to buy?\n\nA: I recommend buying an official Apple.com refurb - you'll likely save more than from Amazon and they often have very current models.  The machine will be indistinguishable from new, aside from the packaging and comes with a full warranty.\nPut the savings towards buying cheaper Applecare from Amazon :)\nYou can follow stock availability here: http://refurb-tracker.com\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you want to choose between the Apple Online Store (not the Apple Store as Philip implied) and Amazon. If that is the case, you don't have any advantages when buying directly from Apple (only if you are an educator, student or pupil - because you will be able to purchase from the Apple Education Store then). Go to Amazon if it is cheaper there.\nIf you're thinking about choosing between an Apple Store and any Online Store you have the advantages mentioned by Philip.\n\nA: If anything, buying the laptop from the Apple store will give you a level of customer service that no other store can match. They'll probably help you get it set up, registered, and all that if you ask. That, and the certain cache that comes from walking out an Apple store with brand new kit under your arm. Beyond that, there's really not much you can buy there that can't be had for cheaper elsewhere.\n", "Q: Starcraft 2 update crash I'm trying to update Starcraft 2 to patch 1.3.1.

What you can't do is connect and share over the same port.\n\nA: i think it's better to get a router than use internet sharing mainly because the mac sharing the internet connection will need to remain powered on when your second mac needs the internet. =)\n\nA: Yes - either use a router or turn on \"Internet Sharing\" on one of the laptops (effectively the same thing as using a router).\nSystem Preferences => Sharing => Internet Sharing\n\nA: In order for computers to talk on the same network, they must have different IP addresses. However, it is possible to have two or more computers share an internet connection by having them on a private network separate from the internet, then routing their data through a gateway that is able to be on more than one network. The gateway usually uses a system called \"Network Address Translation\" or NAT to allow the computers on the private network to operate as if they are on the internet.\nThis is what most home routers do. They provide a private network and a NAT gateway, often combined with a wireless access point and and ADSL modem.\nInternet Sharing (in System Preferences => Sharing) allows a Mac to act as this gateway. It will set up any unused network interface with a private IP address and allocate private IP addresses to any other computers you put on that network. It will then route data from computers on that network to the internet, performing NAT so that all the traffic on the internet seems to be coming from it, and not the other computers.\n", "Q: iPhone ActiveSync showing sent email in Inbox Curious if anyone else is experiencing ActiveSync email accounts showing sent email in your iPhone mail.app Inbox.\nMessages still appear even if \"organize by thread\" is disabled.\niPhone mail seems to handle native Gmail accounts correctly, knowing to hide any sent email, however my Google Apps ActiveSync account/mailbox doesn't.\nIs this a known limitation?

I checked $HOME/Library but couldn't find anything. I want to see if I can change some of the names there. I have several shortcuts to mount Windows C$ shares over there, and I want to see if I can rename them to something a bit more meaningful than just C$. It's a little confusing when you have about a 1/2 dozen shortcuts all with the same name.\nFinder doesn't seem to let you rename them.\n\nA: They live in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist.  The \"Places\" area corresponds to the useritems key.  If you have XCode (any version) installed you can use the Property List Editor to read and edit that file; otherwise you'll need to use plutil to convert it to XML and back.\nI don't know if you can safely rename the entries in that file; they clearly have aliases defined which point back to the originals, but I don't know if the name is ever used for anything other than display or if the Finder will become confused when the alias and name don't match.

Is there way to fix it or does my warranty cover it?\nIt is near the ESC also near the charger input.\n\nA: Warranty generally excludes any scratches to the machine as they are normally cosmetic issue that arise from normal wear and tear as opposed to a functional defect. By extension, Apple Protection Plan will not cover it since it generally follows the warranty guidelines but for a longer time.\nYou could always ask for service - especially if there is some functional concern like usability or you want a second opinion if the device was made properly.

I just discovered SheepShaver and I'm mindblowingly excited!\nI got all my old Mac games out of storage and began to install all of them.\nA trick that I learned awhile ago for making playing games on OS X is to simply make a disk image of the CD and then mount that when I want to play.\nI read about a 'technique' for making Riven play without the Disks which is essentially to edit the riven.cfg file that comes with the install to no longer point to the CDs but instead to point to local directories. I figured something like this should be possible with Myst.\nTurns the Myst app looks to be some sort of Hypercard script. I made what I felt was a logical edit to it which was removing all Myst: prefixes that I could find in the file but that makes the app inoperable. I figured someone else would know how to do this better than me.\nThoughts?\n\nA: You could make a disk image of the Myst CD and mount that for sheepshaver.\nThe original Myst for Mac was indeed an enormous Hypercard script. The Myst: prefixes you refer to are the program referencing the Myst CD. Classic Mac OS used colons as directory delimiters, so the file paths would appear as Myst:Images:Clocktower.jpg in Classic Mac OS or /Volumes/Myst/Images/Clocktower.jpg in OS X. You'll need to rewrite the paths to point to some local file directory. \nSay you installed the Myst app in an Applications folder at the root of the system disk. (This is the OS X location and is not correct or typical for Classic Mac OS, but I have no idea where Classic users stuck apps, so I'll use OS X conventions as a fallback.) This would be /Applications in OS X, so it's Macintosh HD:Applications in Classic (assuming, of course, that you haven't renamed the boot disk). Drag the contents of the Myst CD to a Myst folder on the root level of the boot disk (Macintosh HD:Myst:). Then you can re-point all the file paths in Myst to that directory.\nProgramming note: I'm on Windows at work at the moment, so I've no way to test this immediately. Caveat emptor, but this ought to work.\n", "Q: Writing a Mail.app rule to say \"do not download from server\" I have a POP based mail account from my ISP.\nWhat I need is a way to say \"If the Subject contains XXX then do not download it from the server\".\nThis was simple in Windows Mail, but there doesn't appear to be this rule action in mail.app\nAny ideas?\n(I guess something to say, leave it on the server, and delete it from my inbox\" might also be appropriate).\nEDIT: Is there really no alternative solution to this? Even with a mail plugin?\nPerhaps I should rephrase:\nI need a way to not leave certain messages on the POP server.\n\nA: Mail.app rules cannot run on mail they do not have.  That is to say- a rule cannot be applied to a message that doesn't exist.  Mail.app must download the email in order to parse it in order to run the rule against it. It’s up to the mail server to limit what it sends to the client in this case.\nNow, that said.  If you're dealing with a POP server situation where Mail.app is configured to not delete anything from the server - it should still delete messages you explicitly delete.\nGet into your Mail.app prefs, accounts.  Select the account in question, and go to the Mailbox Behaviours tab.  Check the 'Move deleted messages to the Trash mailbox' checkbox.  Now when you delete something, it'll go to the trash.  Yipee.  I prefer never to have Mail.app delete something itself so mine is set to \"never\", but you could set it to automatically empty the trash at whatever interval you like.\nNow - if you set up your rule, whatever emails are downloaded onto your computer and match the rule will be deleted right away.  Or at least moved to the trash and deleted at your next interval.\nI think when you talk about your PC experience you're talking about Outlook + Exchange, which has a unique feature where you can have the rules actually live on the exchange server and are executed there, rather than on your local computer.  Is this supported by Mail.app on a Mac?  No, not that I know of.\n\nA: Your could set up mail to delete messages on the server when you move them from the official inbox. \nThen make a rule to move all messages except XYZ to a new folder called MyInbox. \nUse that as your real inbox. It is ugly and you lose all the normal nice things about an inbox. \nLong term, you need a second account like gmail to cull and forward the messages meant for you if you need your primary inbox to work like one rather than use a folder as your inbox. \n\nA: A lengthy way to circumvent the problem you have (i.e. messages for different persons in the same inbox, that you want to split up): \n=> use an other mailbox (e.g. gmail, fastmail, ...) that fetches your mail from the POP3 mailserver, and forwards to an other specific address based on the subject. For example, you create a gmail account for yourself, wich fetches from your current mailbox. Email for your relatives are forwarded to their (newly create) gmail addresses.\nUsing gmail or fastmail, you can still pretend to send mail from the old address (i.e. people will not know about your setup), as you can configure alternative 'from:' addresses.\n", "Q: Boot Camp on Late 2010 Macbook Air using USB flash drive?

I use smb to connect to the PC to look at the files:\nIn Finder,  Go -> Connect to Server\nand I use\nsmb://mypc      <-- this is my pc's name in the config\n\nto be able to look at the shared folders on my PC from the macbook (wireless).  But after a couple of day or sometimes a few days, the connection goes bad, and reconnect is waiting for 10 minutes and it still tries to connect.\nIs there a way around this?  Using a different method?  For example, if I set up a webserver on my PC, then the files can be more easily accessible because the macbook has no problem accessing any websites, but i just don't want to need to set up a webserver to do file access.\n\nA: Just a guess; does you home network use DHCP? I wonder if the address lease is timing out and the Mac isn't looking for the PC via your DNS.\nYou could try changing the address lease time on your router to never expire (depending on router type), or you might consider giving the PC a fixed address instead of using DHCP.\n\nA: Not an answer so much as a strategy, I find that sometimes going to a \"Recent Folder\" ( Finder → Go → Recent Folder → some folder name) where some folder name is on the smb share works instantly. \n", "Q: Does Migration Assistant migrate macports? New MacBook Pro here.  I am about to use Migration Assistant to copy over my old files from my old first-gen MacBook.  Will I have to reinstall macports manually or will Migration Assistant copy my /opt directory?    \n\nA: The copying should work without a problem, but if you happen to upgrade to Snow Leopard at the same time, you might run into some compatibility issues, depending on the \"ports\" you have installed. Same goes for old \"ports\" that may have been specifically built for your old system (maybe processor dependent), you could run into problems there, too. \nRemember to run selfupdate, and upgrade the installed ports (where needed).\n", "Q: Possible to disable internal SSD on Macbook Air? Is it possible to temporarily disable the SSD on a Macbook Air?\nI want to install XP on an external USB drive to work with my Late 2010 Macbook Air.  This technique requires detaching your hard disk in order to make the image.  That's obviously a problem since my disk is soldered onto my motherboard.. but on the same token I imagine there's a way to disable it (what if there was an actual malfunction?  perhaps it just renders the unit useless but I'd hope not).\nI have a MBP I can do this on, but XP will surely NOT like to be transferred from one machine to another..\n\nA: The SSD is not soldered to the motherboard, it just has a new, unique connector. You can get in there and detach it. Check iFixit for instructions, and beware that such may void your warranty.\nAnd if the Pro is recent enough, it may indeed work to install on there and transfer to the Air.\n", "Q: VLC for iPad and iPhone is available, but how to install? VLC for iPad and iPhone is available, but how to install it?  (it is not an App Store app)\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html\n\nA: VLC was available on the iTunes App Store for some time, and the process for installing it was like any other.\nHowever, a developer, who has contributed to VLC development in the past (IIRC) got in contact with Apple and asked VLC to be removed due to License Incompatibility.\nVLC is licensed GPLv2, which states among many other things, that the source must be available, and I believe there are other provisions surrounding VLC with regard to Apple's per-device DRM.\nThus, Apple de-listed VLC from the App Store, and you cannot buy it anymore. Note that those who purchased it before will likely have it forever. (I still do, I still use it!)\nThere are two ways to install it/run it today:\n(1) If you have a paid Apple Developer account, you may take the source, import it into XCode, codesign it, build/deploy it onto your own device. (Or for that matter, get someone with a Developer Account to do it for you.)\n(2) Since VLC ships a raw .app file, it can be installed if your iPhone/iPad/iPod is jailbroken. I believe raw .app files can be installed via Installous? (Anyone is free to correct me on this, as I don't use Jailbroken devices anymore.)\nUpdate: VLC for iOS was subsequently relicensed and re-released on the App Store. It can be downloaded by visiting this link.\n", "Q: Is there any particular cleaning solution for the MacBook Pro? Is there any cleaning solution for the MacBook Pro?\nHow should I clean my MacBook? Which fabric should I use to clean it?\n\nA: I use a dry microfiber cloth on my screen. I found them in a two-pack of washcloth-sized at Dollar General.\nIf you want a cleaning solution, the Apple Store folks, at least in Madison WI, fully endorse iKlean and use it on their display models every night. I can't vouch because I haven't used it, but I figure Apple knows Apple well.\n\nA: Here is a quote from the MacBook Pro: Care, Use, and Safety Information page.\n\nCleaning Your MacBook Pro Display.\n  Follow these general rules when cleaning the screen.\n  Shut down your MacBook Pro, detach the power adapter, and remove the battery.\n  Dampen a clean, soft, lint-free cloth or paper with water only and wipe the screen. Do not spray liquid directly on the screen.\nCleaning Your MacBook Pro\n  Follow these general rules when cleaning the outside of your computer and its components:\n  Shut down your MacBook Pro, detach the power adapter, and remove the battery.\n  Use a damp, soft, lint-free cloth to clean the computer’s exterior. Avoid getting moisture in any openings. Do not spray any type of liquid directly on the computer.\n  Don’t use aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives.\n\nI'm sure people are not using only water to clean their MacBooks and they are fine, but for me a wet microfiber cloth is sufficient.\n\nA: I use the same cloth I get from the optical shop, microfiber cleaning cloth, and add just a drop of water to the cloth, not the screen. I turn the screen backlight completely down and shine a bright point source light (aka a desk lamp) onto the screen, with the screen turned so that you can see the screen cruft and fingerprints (and not yourself, lest you start preening).\nIf you keep the microfiber cloth clean they might last a geologic epoch or two.\nI recommend not using anything other than a drop of water on the cloth. The microfiber cloth is a relatively new and dynamite technology for this job. You shouldn't need glass cleaner, and you might in fact clean off any factory-installed screen coatings. Cleaning the older silver laptop keyboards with a similar cleaner  rewards you by removing the paint.\n\nA: With my Unibody Macbook Pro I just use a soft cloth moisted with a bit of glass cleaner (nothing fancy, any multisurface cleaner that happens to be around at home)\nI haven't had any issues with this in my Unibody Macbook Pro.\n\nA: I agree with a lot of the previous commenters and want to add my opinion to the mix. \nAs an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP) we clean each machine that comes in for repair/upgrade. There are some very overpriced cleaners out there and we've tried a lot of them. iKlean is good, but we regularly use this: \nhttp://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=109&cp_id=10902&cs_id=1090201&p_id=5177&seq=1&format=2 \nCan't beat the price! If you've never looked at Monoprice, they have some great prices on quality products. HDMI, Cat 5 - 6, etc. \n*I don't work for Monoprice, but I enjoy sharing companies that I believe in and trust.\n\nA: Similar to wjl's method, I have used a microfibre polishing cloth alongside a device & screen cleaner solution from Muc-Off. There products are also available to buy from the retailer Amazon (where applicable).\n(They also have a range of products for motoring & bicycles as well).\n", "Q: How can I reset my bash configuration?

Now I cannot do anything in Terminal. Even \"ls\". It returns…\nbash: ls: No such file or directory\n\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Sounds like it's screwing up your PATH, so the shell can't find any of the usual commands.  In this case, you can still use the commands by specifying their entire path (e.g. /bin/ls instead of just `ls), or just reset your PATH manually:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\n(Note that that's based on the error you gave; there may be some directories missing.)\nIf .bash_profile is the only thing messed up, it's probably easiest to just disable it:\n/bin/mv .bash_profile bash_profile_disabled\n/bin/mv .bashrc bashrc_disabled\n\n... and then open a new (clean) Terminal window, and then look through the file to see if you can undo the damage before renaming it back.\n", "Q: How can I get a high-quality screen capture on a mac? ⌘ + Shift + 3\nThe screen capture shortcut on the Mac is one of the most useful tools I know. It grabs the screen and neatly places a .png file onto your desktop.\nBut is this the highest quality screen capture you can get? Is it possible to get a higher resolution screen capture? Are there any ways to tinker with the settings of this command?\n\nA: The image will always have the same dimensions as the screen or window being captured — a 1440x900 screen will create a 1440x900 screenshot.\nToday's operating systems are resolution-dependent: everything you see screen is either being shown at actual size (e.g. a 10-pixel-by-10-pixel icon which has actually drawn as 10 pixels by 10 pixels) or has been rendered at some pixel dimensions. So, the size of objects on a computer display is entirely dependent on the pixel density of the display — a higher-resolution screen (or screen capture!) would make everything smaller.\nAn interesting example of this is Apple's iPhone 4 — its screen has a higher resolution (and pixel density, since the screen is the same physical size) than previous models. Apple had to craft bigger icons to keep everything the same apparent size, and screenshots from iPhone 4 are much larger than older models.\nYou can change the format of screenshots, and the folder where they're dropped, using utilities like TinkerTool.\n\nA: Using the terminal you can change the file type to jpeg, which can give you more compressed file sizes.\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nInstead of jpg you can also set it to many other file types including tiff, pdf, png, bmp or pict. Try which one works best in your case.\n\nA: The PNG is losslessly compressed; there's isn't a possible better-quality screenshot.\n\nA: On retina displays we can accomplish this by visiting: System Preferences >> Displays, making sure the resolution is set to \"Scaled\" and selecting the \"Larger Text\" option.\n\n\nA: I have experimented a bit with this, and I found out that on a non retina display, a screen capture is done with 150 dpi when using the pdf format from the commandline.\nAs far as I can see, the resolution from the other formats is at a mere 72 dpi.\nSo, pdf must be the best format to do the original screen capture with, and then convert it to jpeg, png or whatever afterwards.\n\nA: I am not sure why people say this is not possible. PNGs will always use lossless compression. You can save a much better quality screenshot by switching the screenshot type to TIFFs.\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture TIFF\n\n", "Q: How to get photos/videos from my iphone into the cloud easily I make photos every day. I want them to be kept somewhere safe (online, not on my computer), without having to think about it.  Either over 3g, or whenever I'm near a wifi, I want my videos and photos to automatically upload.\nIdeally to smugmug.com, so I don't need to take additional steps to share a subset of the photos, but something like dropbox or s3 would also do.\nI find it hard to believe I'm the only one with this problem, but I haven't been able to find a good solution yet. (Best thing so far: PhotoSync with flickr sync)\n\nA: Don't worry, Apple says it's coming in iCloud\n\nA: You suggest Dropbox yourself, so I am not sure what alternative solution you are looking for?\nOn my Android I can save photos to a specific Dropbox folder.\nResult: it is automatically synched to my computer and stored online as well. In addition you can publicly share dropbox folders, so other people are able to look at your pictures as well. \nThe only thing you still have to do (which you probably won't with iCloud) is saving your photos specifically in a dropbox folder.\n", "Q: Calendar alert sound on the iPodTouch isn't loud enough is there some \"mobile\" way to make it louder? Calendar alert sound on the iPodTouch isn't loud enough is there some \"mobile\" way to make it louder?\n\nA: As far as \"volume boost\" or \"overdrive\" type features are concerned, I don't think there is one. You could always get a battery powered external speaker.\nWhen I'm out driving I usually plug my iPhone into my car stereo and listen to music / Pandora. It quiets the music (but doesn't pause) to play notification sounds, so it's quite audible.\n\nA: I would just change the ringer on it to something louder. You can make it different in Settings -> Sounds.\n\nA: Head over to Settings - Sounds and check whether the volume of the ringer is on its loudest. \nOn my iPod there is a different volume for my music and one for my ringer (FaceTime :)\n", "Q: weird problem : whenever I copy songs from my computer to my iphone it misses the first 30 seconds? Anyone experience this problem? It all of a sudden started happening for me.\nWhen I download podcasts from my iphone, it seems to be fine, but when I download from my computer whether its songs or podcasts, it'll copy the song, but it'll be missing the first 30 seconds and last 10 or so seconds - sometimes it'll skip to different places during the song. Is there anything I can do about this?\nI have a iphone 3gs version 4.2.1, jailbroken with greenpoison.\n\nA: ZoneAlarm, and other firewalls, may occasionally interfere with the syncing process.  Turn off the firewall during sync to see if it's the problem.  If it syncs well after that, contact your firewall provider and ask for the proper setting so you don't have to disable it every time you want to sync.\nAlso, iOS 5.x can sync wirelessly, which may resolve the problem.\n\nA: If you bring up the info window for a file in iTunes, and go to the Options tab, you'll see settings for the Start Time and Stop Time of the file. See if these are getting set erroneously.\n", "Q: How to Automate Cropping Images? Is there any way to automate cropping images on Mac? (Not the whole file, but part of the file.) \nI've tried this with Automator but the cropping function just makes the whole image smaller instead of chopping the part that I don't want off of the image. \n\nA: You may use ImageMagick in order to crop from command line. That way you may include the command inside an Applescript, or call the command directly from terminal.\nYou can install it following these instructions and then you crop all images inside a folder, given:\n\nconvert '*.jpg' -crop 120x120+10+5 thumbnail%03d.png\n\nwhere 120x120 is the resulting size and 10+5 is the offset (10 pixels width and 5 pixels height).\n\nA: If you have Xcode installed, you could download and compile and install (via Automator's import menu) Convert Images to Letterbox Format (completed) from Apple's developer library. That action crops without resizing.

The settings icon was deleted and I can't recover it. It's very weird because usually you can't delete default apps icons.\nI can't find it in iTunes either after connecting and sync iPod with iTunes.\nI would prefer not to lose my current settings like bookmarks in Safari, mail settings, etc.\nThe iPod is not jailbroken and I would prefer not to jailbreak it.\nAccessing the settings panel is enough, I don't really need the icon.\n\nA: Are you certain you didn't just accidentally put it in a folder? It's impossible to delete, as you note.\nYou can determine if the app is still there by sliding springboard to the right until the spotlight search pane is revealed. Type \"settings\" and if the app is still installed it will appear in the search results; tapping on the result will launch it.\nIf it still shows up in spotlight then it's there on your device somewhere. The other possibility, if it's not in a folder or you're otherwise just missing it, is that all 11 springboard pages are full of app icons and you somehow accidentally moved your Settings app to the 12th page or beyond. In that case, group some apps into folders and, if necessary, sync with iTunes, at which time the icon will become visible again.\n", "Q: Can you add an accented characters to the querty keyboard on the iPad? I'm looking to add another layer to the querty keyboard on the iPad so I can get accented characters.  Can I do that?\n\nA: An even simpler way to access the most commonly accented characters is to hold down that letter and you are given options.\nTo see what I mean, just click and hold on the letter \"o\" and you'll be given a lot of choices. \nThe standard keyboard on a USA iPad will have accented characters for e, y, u, i, o, a, s, z, c and n.\n\nA: The way to do that is to add more keyboards. If you have several keyboards active, you can cycle through them using the globe key to the left of the space bar. To add more keyboards, go to Settings → General → Keyboard → International Keyboards. Pick a national keyboard that has the accented letters you want.\n\nA: No, you can not modify the keyboard layout itself without jail breaking the OS. The other answers do list the existing features for accessing these characters, but I have written an article summarizing why having alternate keys on iOS isn't equivalent to keyboards with dedicated single key presses for commonly used keys.\n", "Q: Why Did Time Machine Delete My Old Backups? I recently upgraded my hard drive from the stock Hitachi 250GB to a Western Digital 320GB. I restored from Time Machine.\nI plugged in my hard drive today and left my hard drive to back up. Surprisingly, when I came back, the backups were being deleted. \nWhy? \nIt was the same installation. Now my unrecoverable backups are gone. \n\nA: After a full restore, a full backup is preformed (always). It's by design. This is also documented on the wonderful Podini - About Time Machine site, section TM is doing a full backup for no good reason. Other circumstances, that may trigger full backup, are listed too.\nI quote:\n\nAnd Time Machine may do a full backup after any of the following:\n   * A full restore, whether from Time Machine or a \"clone\" (probably)\n\n", "Q: Simplest way to audit and monitor my home network and deal with intruders (while leaving it all open) Please don't give me a suggestion that you haven't tried and approved yourself. Also please feel free so skip and not read anything below. I trust the title is already summing up pretty good.\nWhat I've got\nStrong passwords, updated system, some log monitoring with Who Is Connected and nothing else. Just the passwords and updates have been enough until now. But that's probably only because I have no presence online, random IP and, on the wifi side, I'm in a spot that not many people get close enough to get the signal. Which makes this a good sandbox environment.\nI've tried about all tools listed in links from this question, and they're either not working, too complicated or have some bug.\nWhat I'm looking for\nWhat you say? What are the simplest things that can be done on the mac to keep it stable, open and free within an open wireless network (and the already open internet)? That is, other than buying the fonera, which I'm waiting to arrive back from warranty - I want to know only mac-wise.\nAdding to that, I'd want the same thing when connected to any other network. But I believe that's nearly irrelevant as I don't care if data is being spoofed. I'm not trying to secure any data out of my machine / network.\nAnd yes, the question is a bit misleading on purpose. I do ultimately want to secure my whole home network, but I also know it can only be done starting on the router and applying strong policies in every machine within it. \nFor Instance\nJust the other day I've realized my mac is constantly being attacked over the web through SSH - and looks like there's nothing I can do fast enough to prevent a big harm in case someone could break in. I can barely knows if someone brute forced my password, even while highly unlikely, and does nothing else after that for whatever reason.\nSo, in this instance, I'd like to be able to first block the attacker with some smart firewall rules, then to send back a message \"I'm watching you\" or anything like this, just to intimidate. It could also be changing any welcome message specifically to the attacker. Changing SSH port is the most suggested measure, but I'd really want to avoid doing that.\nThere's another instance where the attack were through AFP, which I also want to leave open. Someone added a \"Pamela\" folder to my dropbox, which is perfectly fine. But if I don't go there and see it's there, I don't get any notification about it and don't get to see who did it and when. Ideally I would see the exact moment and even get to interact with the user somehow.\nSumming up\nThe solution would probably be enough if it were one software able to: get me notified of any user connection anywhere (but just once per user / attack / minute or something), take a preventive automatic measure, give an automatic response and give me options to take action if needed.\nAnd\nSorry for such a big and long question!\n\nA: Mocha\n\nMocha is a tool that monitors your network activity and keeps a record of Ip / Mac address pairings and firewall logs. It will give a warning when it notices any suspicious activity, like any changes in Mac address or any connection attempt to the firewall.\n\nI hope that helps! :)\n\nA: Change your SSH port to a different one than the default 22.  Security by obscurity is generally a bad thing to solely depend on but you'll get a good ROI for this tactic in the way of less attacks for sure.\n", "Q: Can't see bootcamp anymore after OS X install My mac pro (first gen) previously had a whole disc dedicated to Windows/bootcamp.

My wife's 2007 Macbook has a busted screen and a screwed up keyboard.  I have a work PC and she can use my Macbook Pro but I was wondering if I could use her Macbook sitting on my network as a NAS for Time Machine and an iTunes music storage.\nI have a 320gig USB hard drive that I can plug in to it.\nIs there some way that I can use the USB Hard Drive plugged in to her Macbook as a network drive?  Without reinstalling OS X would be the nicest thing.\n\nA: You can use the USB drive plugged into the busted computer as a network drive with OS X's file sharing.\nMount the drive with USB. Go to System Preferences-> Sharing -> File Sharing. Turn it on and click the plus button. Click on your USB drive and click Add. Add your user account on the right.\nNow, go to another computer on the network. The busted MacBook should appear in the Finder sidebar. Click it and click Connect As. Type in your username and password (the one you use on the busted MacBook). Let it log in. Click on the USB drive and let it load the list of files. You should now see your USB drive mounted on your desktop.\nNow, to configuring Time Machine.\nBy default, TM doesn't let you use a network drive unless its a Time Capsule. But, you can allow it do so by changing a hidden preference.\nOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities). Type this in and press enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\nNow, open System Preferences -> Time Machine. Turn it on and set it to use your network drive.\nBackups will be slowish, but they should work.\nIf you want to use iTunes and Time Machine, you'll need to use Disk Utility to partition the drive into two partitions. Time Machine needs a whole partition to run...\nIf you do that, just make sure that you select both partitions on the busted MacBook's Sharing System Preferences pane. Set up Time Machine to use one partition, and add your iTunes folder on the other one.\nNotes: The MacBook will have to be turned on for you to get at its files.\n320GB is kinda small for a Time Machine disk, especially if you're partitioning to keep media on it. Just be careful...\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Sharing the hard drive over the lan, is really easy!\nYou just have to go to \"System Preferences\" > Enable \"Sharing\" > click on \"+\" under \"Shared Folders\" and select the hard drive. There you may also set the sharing permissions. It would be nice also to ensure that the protocol is AFP and SMB (in order to be accessible by both Mac and Windows machines), by visiting the \"Options..\" menu.\nYou may also set the \"Computer Name\", in order to be more easily distinguishable on your lan.\nAfterwards, the Macbook will be visible in Finder's sidebar, under the \"Shared\" section. Going there you might have to click on \"Sign in as..\" and enter the Macbook's user login details. \nThen the hard drive would be mounted and you may use it as a Time Machine disc, or to put there your iTunes library.\nI cannot guarantee you though, about the performance of the backups, using this method.\nFor sharing music and videos though, it would be much easier to use iTunes Home Sharing though..\n", "Q: Is there a way to lock a folder's icon without making its contents Read Only?

What I found was that I can't find accessories for iPad, and the accessory box says it is for iPod/iPhone/iPod Touch, but there was no mention about iPad.\nIs that because all the iPhone/iPod accessories are compatible with iPad? I mean, if it's for iPhone/iPod, is it always also for iPad?\n\nA: I believe the lack of accessories may be due to the power requirements of the iPad.\nThe iPad comes with a 10 watt charger while most iPhone chargers are only 1 watt.

I had about 8.9GB hard disk space before installing Snow Leopard (had Leopard before).  After installation, the hard disk space increased to 20GB.\nWhat caused this huge jump?  I know some webpages says it is because the way Apple calculates disk space, using 1,000,000,000 instead of 2^9 for a GB, but the difference should be only 7.4%\n2^9 = 1,073,741,824\n\nSo, why did 8.9GB of free space become 20GB?   8.9 x 1.074 = 9.56GB, so why is there an extra 10.5GB? Even if some printer drivers were deleted, they should only take up tens of MB, not 10GB.\n\nA: The main reason Snow Leopard frees up so much disk space is that it discards all PPC code from the system and system applications when it is installed.\n\nA: John Siracusa’s review of Mac OS X 10.6 lists several space freeing features (on page 3). The biggest contributors are “install on demand components”, dropping support for PowerPC processors, and “HFS+ compression”.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Rosetta PowerPC binary translator software and the bulk of the printer drivers and are not installed by default.\nThey can be installed from DVD or downloaded when they are needed.\n\n*The system-installed programs have dropped support for PowerPC processors.  \nAt least one architecture was eliminated from every program on the system (32-bit PPC). Some of them dropped two architectures (32- and 64-bit PPC). This means that most Snow Leopard executables only store code for half the number of ISAs as the equivalent Leopard binaries. The different ISAs take different amounts of binary code to represent the same high-level program, so this does not always mean a 50% space savings for each binary. Nevertheless, “50% byte savings for each executable” is a fairly accurate estimate.  \n\n*Many of the Snow Leopard files are also transparently compressed.  \nLimited access to HFS+ compression is provided in through the \nditto(1) and \nafscexpand(1) commands. Some third part tools provide ways to identify or find such compressed files, but this is generally not a “user level” feature.\nThe review also mentions the change to powers-of-ten for reporting large byte sizes (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 (10^9) bytes instead of 1,073,741,824 (2^30) bytes) in the “A gigabyte by any other name” sidebar.\n", "Q: iPad management in medium sized business Our developer is putting the finishing touches on an internal web application. We'll be using it on the internal network and through a series of iPads. The iPads will connect through our IPSec VPN to the web application. We'll have approximately 15 iPads when fully rolled out.\nI fooled around with the iPhone Configuration Utility and set up the wireless credentials and VPN configuration, as well as locked down the music and video section.\nThere's a couple points that I'm not really that happy with. For example, I don't really want the Address Book or Calendar visible particularly. I've moved them onto a second page of Apps. \nI also don't like that the VPN disconnects every time the device is put to sleep. I'd prefer if the VPN autoconnected like the Wifi does, but that's not so much of an issue as the automatic disconnection. I wouldn't even mind if the iPad remembered the VPN password, because the user has to type the iPad password, VPN password and then the application username and password, which makes for a bit of a tedious experience. \nI don't see any configuration options on the device or the iPhone Configuration Utility. \nMy question is does anyone have any experience in the 3rd party vendors that use the additional enterprise APIs and if so, do any of these annoyances I've listed above possible could be handled using such a 3rd party company / software?\n\nA: Cisco IPSec deployments can take advantage of certificate-based authentication via\nindustry-standard X.509 digital certificates. With certificate-based authentication, iPad supports VPN On Demand. VPN On Demand can establish a connection automatically\nwhen accessing predefined domains, which would provide you with seamless VPN connectivity.\nFor two-factor token-based authentication, iPad supports RSA SecurID as well as\nCRYPTOCard. Users enter a PIN and a token-generated, one-time password directly on\niPad when establishing a VPN connection.\nNow without jailbreaking, you can't remove/hide the iBooks or any default icon. Unless someone knows otherwise.\n", "Q: Is Bonjour supposed to make your home networking a lot easier? If Bonjour is installed on all PCs, Macs, is it supposed to make home networking a lot easier?  (the heaven of seeing all shared folders any where at home?)\n(even the VLC Streamer on iPad claims to use Bonjour)\nBut now I go look for Bonjour, and Apple is saying it is a printer service:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl999\nBonjour Print Services for Windows\n\nA: In a word, yes. Printing is only part of it. http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/core-foundation.html gives a short description, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software) is a much more detailed one.\n\nA: That would be a particular Bonjour-using service (which will be bundled with Bonjour for Windows; BfW is also bundled with Safari, iTunes, and MobileMe for Windows, among others).  Apple doesn't distribute Bonjour for Windows (to end users; for developers/OEMs there's a package to be bundled with the OEM's own software) all by itself because most people want to do something with it, not just install it.  :)  (So you get what amounts to a naming artifact due to BfW technically being a separate package, just one that's always distributed along with something else.)\n", "Q: After upgrading to Snow Leopard, don't I have to upgrade Chrome or Firefox and other programs to 64-bit version? Since I have been using Leopard on my Macbook, all the apps should be 32-bit.\nSo an hour ago, the macbook is upgraded to Snow Leopard.  Does that mean all apps should also be upgraded to 64-bit version for speed?\nFor example, does Chrome, Firefox, (and any other popular ones) have 64-bit versions?\n\nA: 64-bit apps have been fully supported since Leopard (OS X v10.5), and 64-bit non-GUI programs since 10.3.  The only thing 10.6 added was that Apple included a 64-bit kernel (which is a completely separate thing), and included 64-bit code in (almost) all of the programs they ship with the OS.\nOS X uses a \"fat\" binary format, which allows a single program to include multiple CPU-architecture versions of itself; when it's run, the OS picks the \"best\" version of the program, and runs that.  For instance, on a 64-bit capable Intel Mac, it'd look for a 64-bit Intel version first; if that wasn't available, it'd look for a 32-bit Intel version; if that wasn't available, it'd look for a 32-bit PowerPC version and run that under the Rosetta emulation/translation system.\nNet result: many of your programs are probably already 64-bit capable, and have been running in that mode for a while now.  Some may not be, in which case they'll keep running just fine in 32-bit mode.  It's all remarkably transparent.\nIf you want to know which of your programs support 64-bit mode, run the System Profiler utility, and select Software -> Applications from the sidebar; it'll list all the programs it can find, along with whether they're Intel-only, PowerPC only, or Universal (both), and whether they have Intel 64-bit support.  You can also use Finder's Get Info on a program; if it has an \"Open on 32-bit mode\" option, that program includes both 32- and 64-bit versions of itself (and that option will let you override the OS's ideal of the \"best\" version).\nNow, to answer your more direct question: I don't know about Chrome, but Firefox version 3.x comes in a 32-bit only binary; version 4 comes with both 32- and 64-bit.  Either one will work fine.\n\nA: If you use FF4 then you can switch between 32- and 64-bit in the \"Get Info\" view of the Firefox.app.\nI want to use the 64-bit (default selection) but I can't because I uses some FF add-ons that doesn't work in 64-bit - yet.\n", "Q: What's the difference between iPad's a-GPS and iPhone's GPS? iPhone has GPS, and iPad 3G model has Assisted GPS. What's the difference between the two? Which is better? Do I need to buy GPS receiver if I want to get real GPS data? \n\nA: The iPhone also has Assisted GPS. The iPhone page you pointed to only has abbreviated versions of the features; when you check the actual \"specs\" pages for both devices you get the same info.\nBoth get real GPS data (assuming one of the 3G versions of the iPad, the wifi-only versions have no GPS). The \"assisted\" part just means that it also uses cell tower locations and wifi networks it can detect to help narrow down your location, usually much faster than it can get a full GPS lock from the satellite signals.\nIn real-world experience they both work well, but both have fairly small GPS antennas. If you want really solid turn-by-turn directions while driving, an external GPS antenna is definitely helpful. Tom-Tom makes a pretty sweet combination mount, charger, and boosted GPS antenna. \n", "Q: How can I show the login window after a period of inactivity? How can I make my Mac display the login screen (as though I'd selected \"Login window\" from the fast user switching menu) after the session has been idle for a certain time?\nI can make it log out after some amount of inactivity, but I don't want that. I want my programs to continue running.\nI can also set the screen saver to require a password, and clicking the \"Switch user\" button on the password dialog will display the login screen. I'd effectively like to skip that step and go directly to the login screen without having to push the button.\n\nA: One solution could then be this one...\nDownload this ScriptSaver (ScreenSaver): http://swannman.wordpress.com/projects/scriptsaver/ - which can run AppleScripts.\nThen write an AppleScript script with this content:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    do shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend > /dev/null\"\nend tell\n\nSetup a ScreenSaver in \"Desktop & Screen Saver\", and configure this with the ScriptSaver, which you then setup with the AppleScript script from above.\nAfter min. 3 minutes the current user session will be switched to the Fast User Switching window.   \n\nA: Rob, you can use DssW Power Manager to automatically Fast User Switch to the Login Window after user inactivity. This will leave your account logged in and your applications running.\nThe following link shows you how to create the required event for automatically logging out; in step 4 change the action from Log Out to Fast User Switch to get the behaviour you are after:\nHow to Automatically Log Out After Inactivity on Mac OS X\n\nPower Manager also includes a task to \"Secure sleep after inactivity\".

How can I see be sure the sound playing in 192/24 quality, not just 192/16? Is 24bit/16bit sound switching begins automatically?\n\nA: I used to own one of these cards and used it on a Windows PC. If I'm not mistaken, M-Audio (now owned by Avid) no longer supports this card. It's been declared obsolete and orphaned. Good luck.\n", "Q: Where is Active Directory configuration information stored? I'm curious as to where Active Directory configurations are stored on Mac OS X 10.6. \"man dsconfigad\" and \"man dscl\" are both silent on where those utilities store/read their information. \nIn particular, I want to find where the AD binding authentication information is stored (hopefully securely?).\n\nA: The config info for the Active Directory connector is all in /Library/Preferences/DirectoryService, in a bunch of files with names starting with \"ActiveDirectory\".  The one with the bind info has file permissions set so only root can read it.  There's also some related info in other files (e.g. that the AD connector is enabled, and its inclusion in the search policies), but most of it's right there.\n", "Q: External Hard drive automount problem I have a Drobo hooked up to my intel mac mini mounted to /Volumes/Drobo, although after a poweroutage the Drobo now automounts to /Volumes/Drobo 1.  I unmount it and mount it back on /Volumes/Drobo so that all of my apps work but, how can I force it to go back to using /Volumes/Drobo as the automount location?\n\nA: You probably have a folder named /Volumes/Drobo, so it has to pick a different name to mount the drive under.  In one sense, this is fairly easy to fix: just rename/move/delete that folder, remount the drive, and you're set.\nBut it's probably more complicated than that because you probably have something set to automatically access something in /Volumes/Drobo, and when that doesn't exist it'll recreate it (which is probably what caused the problem in the first place -- after the port failure, the Drobo didn't remount in time, and whatever it was created an empty folder where it should've been).  So, you'll need to figure out what's recreating that folder, and get it to stop long enough to do the rename and remount operation.\n", "Q: How can I get notified when a new jailbreak or unlock is released?

I find really annoying to use Midnight Commander under OS X when using the non-extended keyboard (laptop).\nI found no way of simulating an INSERT key press (select file) and I would like to find a solution that does not require me to reconfigure MC, specially because I cannot do this with each machine I'm connecting to from my MacBook.\nI will give extra bonus ;) for and extended solution what will solve the problem not only for the INSERT (select file) but also for switch selection and add/substract selection (NumMultiply,NumMinus,NumPlus). \nRemember that Numlock area *, + and - are not the same as the ones from the standard keyboard. \n\nA: Ctrl+T is standard hotkey for file selection — http://linux.die.net/man/1/mc.\nAs for switch/add/substract, just type Shift+8 for *, Shift+= for + and - for minus.\nAll this works in MC out of the box.\n\nA: For those like me who were drawn here by a Google search based on the title of the question (not relating to Midnight Commander), I still haven't found a great solution.  However, for Word processors (a common usage of needing to find the \"insert\" key to toggle Insert/Overwrite mode), you should be able to click the text that says \"INSRT\" or \"OVER\"/\"OVWT\" in the status bar on the bottom of the Word Processor to change modes, as detailed here for Open Office.

I know in my experience with an iPhone 4 it does heat up when the screen is On while charging.  However, this was in a period of an hour or two.  15 minutes shouldn't cause the phone to overheat like that, even on Skype.  I suggest to take it to an apple store like @glenstorey said.\nExplain the process you go through with the apple employee.

You can Right Click on any element to get a Open In Terminal option\n\n\nA: Try this:\nhttps://github.com/nmadhok/OpenInTerminal\nIt works with the Finder's sidebar items, multiple folder/file selections and anything you could think of. Really easy to use! \n\nA: You can drag any file or folder from the finder onto a Terminal window to insert a string of said file or folder's absolute path.\nThis will work on any standard install (at least back until 10.4 Tiger [¿maybe earlier?]) without needing additional software our twiddling of preferences, either of which may later freak out your non-techy friend if it happens to be his/her Mac that you’re working on. This trick also works for any process that is running in the Terminal, e.g. emacs or vi (assuming you’ve got vi in the appropriate mode, or however it is that you people who use vi do).\n\nA: You can do this with the service feature.\nThe following site contains an example of such a service:\nhttp://blog.leenarts.net/2009/09/03/open-service-here/\n\nA: OpenInTerminal\nYou could try OpenInTerminal: https://github.com/Ji4n1ng/OpenInTerminal\nIt has a really nice icon and is implemented as Finder Extension.

They also work with absolute pathnames selected in text (in any application). You can enable these services with System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services. Look for \"New Terminal at Folder\" and \"New Terminal Tab at Folder\". You can also assign them shortcut keys.\nIn addition, you can now drag folders (and pathnames) onto the Terminal application icon to open a new terminal window, or onto a tab bar in a terminal window to create a new tab in that window. If you drag onto a tab (rather than into the terminal view) it will execute a complete cd command to switch to that directory without any additional typing.\nAs of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8, Command-Dragging into a terminal will also execute a complete cd command.\nNote: The New Terminal at Folder service will become active when you select a folder in Finder. You cannot simply have the folder open and run the service \"in place\". Go back to the parent folder, select the relevant folder, then activate the service via the Services menu or context menu.\n\nA: For those using iTerm, the AppleScript syntax has change in iTerm version 3.

This works in many apps, not just Finder.\n\n\nA: I mostly use this function:\ncf() {\n  cd \"$(osascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)')\"\n}\n\nYou could also assign a shortcut to a script like the ones below.\nReuse an existing tab or create a new window (Terminal):\ntell application \"Finder\" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    if (exists window 1) and not busy of window 1 then\n        do script \"cd \" & quoted form of p in window 1\n    else\n        do script \"cd \" & quoted form of p\n    end if\n    activate\nend tell\n\nReuse an existing tab or create a new tab (Terminal):\ntell application \"Finder\" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    if not (exists window 1) then reopen\n    activate\n    if busy of window 1 then\n        tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"t\" using command down\n    end if\n    do script \"cd \" & quoted form of p in window 1\nend tell\n\nAlways create a new tab (iTerm 2):\ntell application \"Finder\" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)\ntell application \"iTerm\"\n    if exists current terminal then\n        current terminal\n    else\n        make new terminal\n    end if\n    tell (launch session \"Default\") of result to write text \"cd \" & quoted form of p\n    activate\nend tell\n\nThe first two scripts have a few advantages compared to the services added in 10.7:\n\n\n*\n\n*As of 10.9, there is a bug where services that receive folders as input are never listed in the services menu in column view. If you assign the New Terminal Tab at Folder service a keyboard shortcut, it doesn't work in column view.\n\n*They use the folder on the title bar instead of requiring you to select a folder first.\n\n*They reuse the frontmost tab if it is not busy, e.g. running a command, displaying a man page, or running emacs.\n\n\nIf you use 10.7 or 10.8, change tell application \"Finder\" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias) to:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists Finder window 1 then\n        set p to POSIX path of (target of Finder window 1 as alias)\n    else\n        set p to POSIX path of (path to desktop)\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThere is a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 (but not in 10.9 or 10.6) where Finder ignores windows created after the last time focus was moved to another application and back when getting the insertion location property.\n\nA: Try the app Open Terminal\n\nThis application allows you to open a Terminal window with the path of the current Finder window. \n\n\n", "Q: What does en0,en1 etc (en) stand for? So on Linux it's eth0, eth1 etc which stands for ethernet interface 0 etc\nSo what does en0 on mac stand for?

Perhaps someone else will chime in with their experience - but I have seen it work recently at several friend's houses as well as in my setup.\nI'm fairly certain I would have noticed a problem back at 10.2.1 as much of my Beatles collection is stored in lossless format but I'm not 100% certain there wasn't a bug in a previous version of iTunes.\nYou could rule that out by upgrading to the latest iTunes 10.3.1.\nI am guessing there is another problem but am at a loss to guess what it might be without more information on your setup.\n\nA: This is only a pointer to a possible clue. I read in this discussion in Apple Support Communities that there may be a problem with iTunes Home Sharing not recognizing certain files because of particular extended meta tags attached to them. Editing and changing the meta tags enables iTunes Home Sharing to work with them.\n", "Q: Google Voice messenger notification problem I have an iPhone 4 with the Google Voice messenger app. However I don't get notifications at all; I've tried everything! If I want to check if I recieved a text I have to go into the app and press the refresh button. Any suggestions?\n\nA: It would be probably a bug with the app. Can you check that you have notifications on for this app, by going into the following setting:\nHome Screen > Settings > Notifications > GV Messenger.\nAdditionally the GV Messenger is not the official Google voice app. You may want to use the official Google Voice app.\n", "Q: Terminal PS1 and colors I am used from Linux to have a colored prompt in my shells and also want to implement that in my OS X Terminal.app. The Terminal reacts differently though. If I use my normal PS1 code the right side of any line will be cut down at a strange point (surely not the right end of the Terminal window).

I'm having first version of iPad and a USB headphone. is it possible to use skype on iPad? I'm on Wi-Fi.\n\nA: I was using Skype on my 3rd gen iPod for audio calls, so I wont think you'll have have any problems using it on a 1st gen iPad.\n\nA: You cannot use USB Headset with an iOS device, however, you can use Skype on your iPad with the iPhone headset or with the integrated mic and speaker. \n", "Q: Redsn0w or PwnageTool? iClarified says that there's an untethered jailbreak for iPhone4 for iOS 4.3.1 which is the most up-to-date version of iOS as of writing this question.\nLet's assume we are talking for unlocked phones. My question is which tool is better - RedSn0w or PwnageTool? My question is valid not only for 4.3.1.\nWikipedia says \"redsn0w is a utility to jailbreak iOS devices\" and \"PwnageTool is an iPhone jailbreaking application for Mac OS X that creates custom iOS firmware images\" (cannot post a third link, but that one is easy to find).\nReasoning for the question: I have read on several places that an irreversible thing could be made to a iDevice (iPhone for example) that mutilates it somehow and it cannot receive updates from iTunes with stock iOS and only custom iOSes can be installed. Wikipedia says redsn0w is a jailbreak utility while PwnageTool creates custom iOS.\nSecond question: does PwnageTool do the irreversible thing I have read about? Does redsn0w do that either?\n\nA: The only irreversible thing you could do is to upgrade your baseband, eventually making it harder/impossible to unlock. In the past bricking the device was possible, because you were able to reflash the bootloader incorrectly (iPhone 2g) and thus bricking the device.\nPwnageTool and Redsn0w are from the same developers team (dev-team) and they are using the same jailbreaking method (as of redsn0w 0.9.6rc9 and PwnageTool 4.3). IMHO both are safe, but PwnageTool gives you more power.\n\nA: I've been jailbreaking and unlocking iPhones since the original and I prefer PwnageTool. \nPwnageTool modifies the firmware to create a custom, jailbroken version on my computer, and then uploads it to the iPhone using the iTunes restore process. This gives me the feeling that, if anything is going to go wrong, it will go wrong on my computer and I can easily abort the process, choosing not to upgrade.\n", "Q: How can I deactivate an jailbroken iOS? Sometimes the activation option from the PwnageTool does bring your GSM in an unusable state if you have and iPhone that is locked to other network than AT&T.\nAll I remember is that it was a tool that I installed using Cydia that was able to deactivate the phone.\n\nA: You should disable activation (it's hacktivation) when jailbreaking if your phone is unlocked (or locked to your carrier).\nIn PwnageTool you should choose Expert and deselect the Activate the phone checkbox.\n", "Q: How can I get Google Voice SMS notifications? I have an iPhone 4 with the Google Voice app. However I don't get notifications at all, I've tried everything! If I want to check if I received a text I have to go into the app and press the refresh button.\nHow can I get notifications working?\n\nA: Go to Settings -> Notifications -> Google Voice. You'll see underneath the the 'Google Voice' line what's being pushed for notifications, chances are yours will say 'Off'. Just tap it and pick which ones you want to happen when you receive a SMS.\n", "Q: Encrypting/protecting Time Machine backup drive? How do you guys secure/protect your Time Machine backup drive? Even though it's an external drive, it's still susceptible to physical theft though. What do you guys do for precautions? \n\nA: With OS X 10.7 Lion you now have the option of encrypted Time Machine backups.\n\nA: You can have backup to an encrypted sparse bundle (the format that time machine backsup to). You can have the sparse bundle automatically mounted on any computer that has the encryption key stored in the keychain.\nThe basic procedure to enable encrypted backups is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable TimeMachine.\n\n*Create an encrypted sparsebundle with the same name as what TimeMachine is already looking for.\n\n*Copy the contents of your old sparse bundle into the new one. \n\n*Replace the old one with the new one. \n\n*Re-enable TimeMachine.\n\n\nHere is a guide that goes more in depth: http://earthlingsoft.net/ssp/blog/2010/05/encrypted_time_machine_backups\n\nA: Using FileVault will encrypt your data while it sits on the Time Machine disk and protect it in the event you have a physical theft. If you choose a good password that you don't use elsewhere it's likely even a motivated thief won't be able to guess that password if they only have your backup drive.\nFor me the downsides of FileVault mean I choose not to have my user data encrypted on the backup drive, but that's the \"offical\" and easy way to secure that data.\nI store my sensitive information inside encrypted DMG on my mac itself which covers that data wherever it's backed up. I store my passwords and \"secret information\" in 1Password. I hide my backup disk inside my Time Capsule which itself isn't readily visible in hopes a smash and grab will overlook it for all the other goodies with a higher resale value.\nI figure I don't need to build fort knox to keep my drive itself secure - but I do have offsite backups of the things I'll need if my house burns to the ground or is burglarized. If the worst happens, I'll change my bank and email passwords and watch for signs of identity theft or unauthorized access.\n\nA: If someone is breaking into my house, I have bigger problems than them accessing my Time Machine drive.\nIf you carry your Time Machine hard drive with you, I'd seriously recommend investing in a second, dedicated drive. If you're carrying both your computer and your drive in your bag and the strap breaks and both drives malfunction through massive paranoia-inspired hyperbole, you have no extra copy, whereas if you have a dedicated drive you just need a new machine (yeah, \"just\") and you can restore.\n\nA: Encryption only works on Time Capsules directly connected to your Mac. It is not possible to encrypt Time Machine backups over your network (e.g. NAS with Time Machine support). This option is then greyed out.\n", "Q: Time Machine: disk was not ejected properly I have an external hard drive (Verbatim #47576) setup as a Time Machine drive.\nEveryday, at random intervals, the computer warns me that the disk was not ejected properly. Why? How to prevent that? Is there a real problem?\niMac8,1 , MacOS X 10.6.7, Darwin 10.7.0, \n\nA: This happens because of a USB Sleep issue with some external usb devices. This happens when the USB disk is put on sleep.\nSome people claim that this problem is solved by disabling Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible in the Energy Saver preferences pane.\n", "Q: How to make specifics apps password protected even after passcode in iPhone? I have passcode on iphone but sometimes i need to give my iphone to other to make calls. I want to make specific things password protected, things like mail, sms, contacts and some games.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: no, this is not possible, sorry\n\nA: While there is no way to get this functionality \"out of the box\", you can take advantage of \"Restrictions\" to accomplish what you want. \nIn the Settings App, tap General, then Restrictions. You can Enable Restrictions and then Don't Allow Any Apps. It's not as convenient, as you have to go through some menus, but it should work.\n", "Q: iPhone/iPad battery charging/discharging cycle Apple recommends at least one charge cycle (charge to 100% and then running it down completely) per month. \nThen, is it OK to charge iPad/iPhone all the time as long as I have charge cycle per month? Or, do I have to refrain from recharging iPad/iPhone until it's completely discharged? \n\nA: The full discharge/charge cycle is mostly to recalibrate the charge controller and the time remaining indicator.  Since the battery doesn't change that much in one month, you could very likely get by leaving it on the charger all the time except for only a few full cycles per year, until it starts getting old and changes more rapidly.\n\nA: You're probably fine charging whenever - a monthly charge cycle or two is more \"a good idea\" and \"recommended\" than \"required\". \n", "Q: Adjust fan speed on ATI graphics card in OS X? I just got an Apple 4870 and am using it with OS X fine. However it is soooo noisy. \nAre there any software tools or firmware mods I can do to change the fan speed at various temperature thresholds? \n\nA: Solved: Edited and reflashed the rom from this guide:\nhttp://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=227787\nWorked an absolute treat\n", "Q: Creating a professional looking screencast? I'd like to create a professional looking demonstration of my app, just like this. I have captured a video using ScreenFlow, but I'm not how to add title screens where I want, like for example in the Sparrow app demo, they first show the name in huge bold text with black background, then \"Navigate\" and so on...which app should I use to achieve that?\nMany thanks for your help.\n\nA: ScreenFlow lets you do all of that. You can split your recording into as many pieces as you'd like, add text boxes (which can be full-screen with a background or can be transparent on top of your video), and transition between pieces of video, text boxes, or even just graphics of your own creation. \nIn a video I created for an app of mine in ScreenFlow I used Photoshop to create some still text screens in Photoshop (where I have super-picky-level control over the lettering) and then put them behind the app video capture. Here's what the timeline looks like in ScreenFlow:\n\nYou can see multiple tracks. The top one is my background music and the next is my voiceover, split up to allow for pauses while stuff happens on the screen. Below that is the text in the upper-right of the screen (you can see that I have it selected) with transitions from one screen of text to another, and then a graphic that shows the url for the app all of the time. Finally is the video track, which I've broken into pieces to allow for better flow.\nThe finished video shows all of it put together.\n\nA: You can add titles right in Screenflow. They can be on a black background as in the video you linked to, or you can lay the titles on top of captured video.\nIf you want to add motion and other effects to the titles, you may need to add another application, depending on the complexity of your needs. For example, it's possible to take desktop video captured in Screenflow, import it into a tool such as Final Cut or After Effects, and add motion titles.\n", "Q: What is the best way to open an 80GB iPod classic? I'm looking for the best way to open an iPod classic, meaning taking it apart. Mine got wet and now doesn't work and I would like to open it up and check that everythin's in place. I would like to do so in the safest way, so as not to dent the iPod. Any suggestions?\n\nA: All you need is the plastic opening tools and follow this iFixit guide.\n\nA: I've had good luck opening iPods with guitar picks in the past without damaging them. You can put them in the side crack and use them as a lever if you are gentle with it. See here:\n\n(source: nuxx.net)\n", "Q: Software to produce plots for very large data sets? I'm looking to produce plots from some very large data sets. To start I've got a data set with 40 different series in it, each with 5000 samples that I'd like to produce a line chart out of, with each series represented by a line in the plot.\nNumbers chokes after about 450 samples. Excel fares a little better and gets to 1000 samples. But neither of them can handle the full set of samples across all the series.\nIs there better software I can use to generate the plot? Would OmniGraphSketcher handle this size of data set? What about R? Or gnuplot?\nSomething with an easier learning curve is preferred (i.e. I'm avoiding gnuplot like the plague until it's clear it's my only hope...) and it doesn't bother me if the generation of the plot can't be done in real time. I don't mind setting things up and then waiting for an image of the plot to be produced in the background. Bonus points if it can produce plot output that's as easy on the eyes as Numbers will produce for smaller data sets.\n\nA: I assume that you mean 5000 observations. R will work, and RStudio will get you to use R with a bit more GUI than the native application. Commercial solutions like Stata -- which has a soft learning curve, in comparison especially to R -- will also work that kind of sample without any difficulty (by statistical standards, 5000 observations is a relatively small dataset).\nThe learning curve will matter if you want to reach beyond a mere plot; otherwise, a quick look at the documentation for line graphs should suffice (for R, check there and there, for instance). HTH!\n\nA: R will definitely handle that size of data for you. If you routinely manage data sets, I would definitely recommend learning it.\nShortcut to giving you the OpenOffice.org suggestion (also known as OOo).\nI'm surprised, however, that Excel crashes on you. I used Excel (on Windows) recently to manage 8 series of 27 000 samples with no issues, producing complex charts in fractions of a second.\nAt what point do these two applications bug? Is it, by any chance, at the time they import your data set, or do they bug when you attempt to compile them into a chart? I don't know about Numbers, but Excel should be able to handle hundreds of thousands of rows without missing a step.\n", "Q: ITunes volume noticeably lower than browser volume Can anyone think of a reason why (and a possible solution) the volume on my ITunes player is lower than other apps (like for example playing videos on youtube or music in grooveshark)?\n\nA: Perhaps you're not aware that there is a volume slider on the iTunes window?\n\nAlso, Are you using an Equalizer? (Window -> Equalizer)\nChange the preamp setting if you feel it is too quiet.\n\n", "Q: Image quality of various Apple cinema displays I have concluded that my office is in sore need of a new display and have decided to take the hit for one of apple's refurbished displays.  The most important thing for me is similar pixels/square inch (so that the same size font shows up the same size on each monitor).  Is there a screen-definition difference between the most recent MacBook Pros and any of the currently available cinema displays on Apple's site?  I could not find any such specs in the product descriptions.\n\nA: Using this calculator, I discovered that the following:\n24\" cinema display has 94 PPI\n27\" cinema display has 109 PPI\n30\" cinema display has 100 PPI\n15.4\" MacBook Pro has 110 PPI\nThus the 27\" is going to be the closest PPI to my current display.\n", "Q: iphone jailbreak - its asking for active sim card i'm in china and need to jailbreak/unlock my iphone to use it here with chinese sim card.

Insert the Chinese sim card you want to use.\n", "Q: What port does iPhone native Facebook app use? The network at my place is using a proxy. So I have set up the proxy in iPhone. I can connect to the internet and access Facebook using the Safari browser without any problem. However when I access Facebook using the native app, it gives me a connection error. Why is this so? Does the native app use different ports instead of getting JSON objects through HTTP port? I am quite new to this, so bear with me.\n\nA: First, this is a really good question. Wow. I've been trying for days to figure out how to attack this one.\nI set up \"Charles Web Debugging Proxy\" on my Mac and set up my iPhone to hit it.\nFirst, it hits http://api.facebook.com/restserver.php, which spits this back:\n<chat_connect_response xmlns=\"http://api.facebook.com/1.0/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://api.facebook.com/1.0/ http://api.facebook.com/1.0/facebook.xsd\"> \n<host>9.channel</host> \n<port>80</port> \n<channel>p_123456789</channel> \n<seq>0</seq> \n\n\nMeanwhile, it also connects to iphone.facebook.com which gives some XML.

What I would like to have is:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default the microphone should be muted\n\n*When CapsLock is Down the microphone should unmute\n\n*When CapsLock is Up the microphone should mute\n(Basically convert my Skype to act like a Walkie-talkie with a push-to-talk functionality)\nI found the AppleScript that can change the volume input of the microphone, so the first step was easy, but I didn't find any way to even assign the CapsLock to a script. Note that my CapsLock key is turned off and I would't like to sTART experiencing something like tHIS.\nIf the CapsLock is very special I wouldn't mind using another key, but I want to achieve the same functionality.\nEdit:\nProbably it is not really possible to do it without using any application, so if there is an app that can do that, it would also work for me.\n\nA: First, the AppleScript that inspects the key state and handles the mic enabling and muting:\nif (modKeyDowntest()) then\n  tell application \"System Events\" to set volume input volume 100\n  repeat while modKeyDowntest()\n  end repeat\n  tell application \"System Events\" to set volume input volume 0\nend if\n\non modKeyDowntest()\n  set modKeyDown to do shell script \"~/opt/checkModifierKeys shift\"\n  set modKeyDown to modKeyDown as integer\n  set modKeyDown to modKeyDown as boolean\nend modKeyDowntest\n\nNote, that\n\n\n*\n\n*the script depends on the checkModifierKeys command line app (and it's path).\n\n*inspects the state of shift instead of caps lock (other possibilities are cmd, option, control and caps lock - caps lock, however, means the status of caps lock, not the key state!)\n\n\nIn the second step we bind the script to a key shortcut. There are many applications that can do this (some listed in an answer in SuperUser) or as an Automator service. (C&P from Lri's answer...)\n\nOne more option is to save the script as an Automator service:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Automator and choose the Service template.\n  \n*Utilities — Run Shell Script / Run AppleScript.\n  \n*Service receives [no input] in [any application].\n  \n*Add the script to the text area and save.\n  \n*Assign a shortcut in System Preferences — Keyboard — Keyboard Shortcuts — Services.\n  \n\nSo, I assigned opt+shift+M to the script above and it enables the mic, keeping it unmuted as long as I hold shift. The mic is muted again when I release shift.\n\nA: I have not used it, but Skii plugin for Skype, seems to provide what you're looking for:\n\nSkii is a very easy to use and simple plug-in that uses the Skype API to simplify the Push-to-Talk function.

Love it so far, but have a question on the battery. It never reaches 100% - usually it makes it up to 96% then the light on the charger goes from amber to green, and the charging indicator says \"fully charged\".\nI've tried recalibrating the battery as described here.\nShould I just take it to the Apple Store and have someone look at it? Is this a typical behavior?\n\nA: My 17\" Macbook Pro battery, is at 95% after 260 cycles!\nSo this is not normal for such a new battery.\nYou should go to an Apple Store and probably they will replace it for you!\nFrom Apple website:\n\nThe built-in battery of your MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80 percent of its original capacity.\n\n", "Q: How to not pay for a song twice? What is an easy way to move a song I bought from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4 to iPad?\nDo I need to move some files such as Mvx034f.mp3 over somewhere and rename it?\nI think the only other way is to let Apple know I want to download it one more time, but that is ONE TIME ONLY.\nQuite often, I leave the song in my iPhone 3 or iPod, and the old computer, and 2 years later, I want to hear that song again.  With a CD, that's no problem.  With the iTunes purchase = Pay Again and I want to avoid it.\n\nA: The best thing to do is to make sure that you set up a proper sync relationship with all of your devices. If you buy something on the iPhone3, then sync it, iTunes will copy it back to your library on your Mac / PC.\nAfter that, you'll be able to synchronize it back to other devices that are connected as long as they are authorized to play it if the song is protected with FairPlay.\n", "Q: How to list my programs in my User Applications folder? Somehow (a long time ago) I deleted the contents of the Applications folder under my username (User/Applications). However, when I typed \"Applications\" into Spotlight, it gave me a folder called Applications with all my Adobe products, MAMP and other software in it.\nSo what I did was \"select all\" on those applications and dragged them to the empty Applications folder under my username. It's taking a long time to copy and I don't think I really wanted to duplicate the data so I hit cancel. \nHow can I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reverse what I did (if I did indeed duplicate all the data)\n\n*Get those applications LISTED in the right folder without duplicating the data\n\n\nA: It seems you duplicated your applications. To be sure, you can do a Spotlight search of one of your application and see if it's listed twice.\nYour \"original\" applications are under /Applications/.\nYou can find it by opening Finder, ⌘+⇧+G, entering /Applications in the text box, and validating. It's a folder at the root of your hard drive that Apple put there to hold all the applications for all the users.\nOnce you checked they're in double, you can delete the ones that are in your user folder.\n\nYour idea of putting all your application under your user account is not a good. Some applications, especially the built in ones, don't like to be moved, and since they already have that special place for them, what's the point?\nBut, you can do it for your own applications, such as Firefox, Adium, etc.\nThose applications can be moved from /Applications/ to the Applications folder in your user account.\n\nFinal question, why do you want your application listed under your user Applications folder?\nI you really want to do that, I guess you can make an alias.\nGo into /Applications/, select all the applications, hold ⌘+⌥ while moving them into the new location.\nThere's a little arrow under that will tell you that they will only be aliased:\n\n", "Q: Trouble Understanding Inactive Memory in MacOSX I thought that I understood how MacOSX manages memory, but recently I’ve become baffled by its performance. Here is the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a brand new Core i7 system with 8GB of physical memory running MacOSX 10.6.7.\nThere are a few Apps running regularly taking up some of the memory—Safari, Mail, Xcode, Terminal, etc.\n\n*I need to run three 64-bit processes in parallel, each of which uses about 2000M of real memory.\n\n*Although the wired memory stays below 1000M (i.e. I have over 7000M available for processes), I see heavy paging activity leading to very bad performance from the three memory-intensive processes that I launched.\n\n*Apparently, I am not running out of available RAM, as the reported inactive memory stays around 2500M and the active memory doesn’t rise above 5000M.\n\n\nCan anyone give me a clue as to why MacOSX does not release the inactive memory for the processes that need it, instead resorting to paging? Also, is there any proper way to influence the memory management by the system?\n\nA: I have found, on my machine, that Mac OS X is a little slow to page the right things out. \nWhenever doing anything particularly memory hungry, I will often quit a few applications to help it out. Safari is a huge memory hog if it has been running for a while and is top of the list of applications to quit. In my case this was when I tried to run VMWare Fusion without quite enough actual RAM.\nYou probably know this but here are a couple of links to Apple documentation which describe memory usage and virtual memory on OS X:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1342\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/AboutMemory.html\nHere is the explanation that is given: The inactive list contains pages that are currently resident in physical memory but have not been accessed recently. It's hard to get an exact definition of what this means but is seems to include a file system cache as well as actual inactive memory. \nInactive memory is probably a difficult thing to handle on an interactive GUI driven OS where a user may choose to switch to any running application at any time and providing responsiveness in this sort of situation is important.... but the flipside of that is that in a situation like yours the OS doesn't quite know what the right thing to do is.\nIt is possible to purge (some of) the inactive memory by using the purge command. This may need to be installed by installing the CHUD tools but you may already have that installed. I haven't tried using the purge command so YMMV...\nI've rambled on a bit and may or may not have answered your question. After writing all this out, I found another question on this site which much of the same info that might also help.\n\nA: MacOS does release the inactive memory, but only if it really needs to.  That \"inactive memory\" may actually be memory that the kernel believes to be a candidate for paging out-- but it hasn't decided yet, pending more time passing without the inactive memory being referenced (instead, it's focusing on paging out the memory that really is less likely to be used again soon).  In such a case, \"purging\" the inactive memory will actually cause your performance to suffer (since those frequently used pages would have to be read back in from disk before your program can continue execution).\npurge is useful for developers to simulate the start-up conditions of an application-- e.g., to see how long it takes to get an application running the first time after a boot or a long hiatus.  For the typical user, purge isn't very useful (and will actually cause temporary performance degradation).\n", "Q: In Aperture 3, Why need option 'detect missing faces'? why not recognise them all in the first scan? each time i import images, some faces are detected instantly and automatically, but I have to run detect missing faces one time more to find other recognizable faces. Note: they are all auto-recognition without manual input.  why possibly does aperture apply such mechanism? \n\nA: The detect missing faces is very useful for when Apple makes changes to the way that faces are detected. Perhaps they changed or tuned it to avoid marking hub caps on sporty cars as faces or added better filters for cats and dogs.\nPeople that imported pictures before these changes may need to ask Aperture to go back and check. \nThis second part is pure speculation - I have no idea if the import does a full check or if the detect is somehow more careful or applies extra checks.\nIf some of the checks take longer to process, it might make sense to to a quick check on import. I have never been unhappy with the initial scans - so I can't really say for sure.\nIt will be hard for you to tell if your library needs rebuilding or if it's just how aperture currently works without testing your images on a different machine with a clean library. If you feel your library isn't working correctly, you could try making a new library to test or rebuilding your library. Do consider making some good backups, because when a library is damaged, rebuilding it can erase bad data and you could lose some pictures. It's designed to not do that, but once things break a repair could cause you to finally see the files that were lost as part of the damage.\n\nA: Facial recognition is a toted feature, but not a staple of the app's function. Import times would take significantly longer with CPU-heavy post processing occurring with high volume imports by professional photographers.\nThe algorithm is meant to be efficient. Apple presents the option for a more intensive analysis of the library for those willing to commit to the overhead.\n\nA: As you confirm more instances of the same face then the Aperture learns a little more about possible matches for each face. As you grow the photobase you should eventually get better matches first time as there is a larger sample to draw on. Allowing you to trigger the recognize operation manually allows you to accellerate this operation, or have it match a face it missed.\nAlso imagine if you will, the howls of derision if this option were missing and you could not enter another cycle of recognition until you imported another batch of images.\n", "Q: How to delete a song from inside an iPod? My girlfriend has an iPod Nano (3G) and she asked me how she can delete a song from inside iPod. \nI didn't find any option inside the device, is it really like that? Can I delete songs only using iTunes?\n\nA: Correct, on a stock iPod that is non jail broken, you can only delete music via iTunes.\n", "Q: How can I share Apple Remote Desktop's list of machines to other computers? We have a server that runs ARD and we use it for Network Discovery. I'm in the process of writing a few scripts to grab the ARD lists and push them to Support Analysts machines. \nHowever the com.apple.RemoteDesktop.plist is not the key file here.\nDoes anybody know if this is possible?\n\nA: I believe you can do this with automator.  You can have an automator script pull your list of ARD computers, (I suppose you could do this from the remote task server as well,) and then execute various functions after that list is pulled in.\nYou can also of course execute AppleScripts (and therefore shell scripts,) through Automator as well, so this should be all you need.\nIn short: Yes!\n\nA: In case Harv's yes wasn't emphatic enough - Apple Remote Desktop and Automator were made for each other. \nYou can export lists of machines from ARD explicitly or programatically using AppleScript and Automator.\nI've know of no program that \"needs\" Automator more than ARD. Having remote desktop to act on many machines means the automation saves you serious amounts of time getting your tasks done.\nThe time you spend learning Automator for managing macs is almost always repaid hundreds of times over when you are managing more than 20 machines for any length of time. Do also explore the built in Asset Management functions before you dive into Automator for the first time. Since ARD stores all data in a SQL type database, you can always dump the fields that interest you to a flat file if you prefer that over structured access to the live data.\n", "Q: How long will the Spring 2010 MacBook Pros be available? I'm thinking about picking up a refurb 13\" 2010 MBP next month. But I just started wondering, how long will they be available?\n\nA: They will be available until they run out.\nAs you are looking at a refurbished product, availability is limited and highly variable. Apple tends to have a continuous supply of refurbished products, however they may not have the specific model you are looking for next month.\n", "Q: Can I remap UP and DOWN arrow keys in Aperture? I want to remap the up and down arrow keys, from Move Selection Up and Move Selection Down to Increase Rating and Decrease Rating.\nThat way, it would be really instant to move between photos with the left/right arrows, and adjust the rating with the up/down arrows.\nUnfortunately, the Commands window does not let you edit these specific actions.\nDoes anyone knows if there is any workaround on this?\n\nA: So, using a little plist trickery, I've managed to re-assign those keys.\nThe steps I took are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aperture > Commands.. > Customize\n\n*Duplicate current command set and name it \"MySet\"\n\n*Export & delete the current set\n\n*Open it with Property List Editor\n\n*Find and Delete: MoveSelectionUp and MoveSelectionDown entries\n\n*Save and exit\n\n*Import it via Aperture > Commands.. > Import\n\n*Select it via Aperture > Commands.. > Custom commands set\n\n\nSo now the UP & DOWN arrow keys are free to assign whatever you like (in my case Increase & Decrease rating feels like the way to go!)\n\nA: Did you try to assign them via the System Preferences? Go to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard panel, and select Application Shortcuts. You can then add your own shortcuts. You can add any Menu text and assign it a shortcut. Beware to spell out the menu text exactly as it appears in the actual menu.\n", "Q: Extract SMS messages off iPhone 4 Ok, I've read past posts, and found good articles on Lifehacker, but I want to crowdsource my worries for a moment: Can I safely extract my SMS messages from my iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3 without jailbreaking or paying money? \nI'm not scared of the SQLite db holding the info and would love to learn a bit about it in the meantime. I would likely use my MBP running 10.6 to do so, but have SUSE Linux and Win 7 systems on hand if that's easier. \n\nA: Do a backup of your iPhone.\nBackups are located here here ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup.\nFind there a file called 3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28 (it might have some extension, can't remember from top of my head if it has one at all).\nIt is an SQLite db file so you can open in in SQLite browser of your choice then and access all your text messages.\n\nA: PhoneView is awesome for the Mac, but you are on a PC.

I want to buy a Solid State Drive for my PC, but also is thinking of just buy Macbook Air or Macbook Pro 13 or 15 inch so that there is already a Solid State Drive.\nHow does the Solid State Drive (SSD) in Macbook Air or Macbook Pro compare to the SSD drive I can buy for the PC?   (for speed)  Especially the Macbook Air, because it is so slim and small, will it have an SSD that is not as fast as the bigger brothers?\nFor example, these two seems highly rated for the PC:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Technology-RealSSD-Solid-CTFDDAC128MAG-1G1/dp/B0039SM0AS\nand\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Intel-Internal-Technology-2-5-Inch-SSDSA2MH120G2K5/dp/B00486UR2I\nand even an external one... but maybe less useful if computer has no USB 3.0\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Iomega-SuperSpeed-USB2-0-External-35141/dp/B0047ZGNIC\n\nA: The AnandTech Review of the fall 2010 MacBook Air models has some graphs comparing the performance of the built-in SSD to some other SSD drives, including some Intel models. Their conclusion is that the built-in SSD is quite good, though not the best available on the market.\nKeep in mind that the storage drive speed is only one factor determining the computer's overall speed. The MacBook Pro models are available with SSD drives as well and will give you better overall speed than a MacBook Air. The AnandTech review of the early 2011 MacBook Pro models includes details about their SSD options, but no direct comparison between the SSDs provided by Apple and market models. They do state \"Apple offers an array of BTO (Build to Order) SSD options, however the drives are likely of average performance.\"\n\nA: For real life usage (which differs a bit from a raw benchmark - even awesome benchmarks that try to measure things directly relevant to real life usage) the shipping MacBook Air with SSD are so much faster than anything with a spinning hard drive it's really amazing.\nYou have to spend twice to three times as much on a really fast iMac or Mac Pro to match the speeds of an Air that is switching amongst 5 or 10 programs that are not CPU bound. The SSD doesn't make things like processing video effects, calculating the layout of a 500 page document when you change styles or fonts, or downloading / uploading large files.  SSD does make all those fractions to tens of a second waiting for a program to launch, switching tasks, firing up a calendar to look something up amazingly faster.\nIf you do things like compile code in Xcode - the differences can be astounding since there may be a thousand header files that need to be read, thousands of .o files generated before the linker will assemble a binary. Ten or 100 to one speedups are not unusual.\nI guess my longwinded point is stock SSD from Apple are well tuned for the Mac they live in and are very competitive with anything else on the market. That fraction slower than the best benchmarking drives is also dwarfed by how much faster and system with better than average SSD are over spinning HD. The vast majority of the time a user is waiting for their mac is where SSD accelerate the user experience on a mac.\nAlso keep in mind that engineering tradeoffs that yield the fastest SSD drives also wear out the FLASH chips fastest. The drives Apple is shipping are likely tuned / specified to last for the 3-5 years of heavy IO that Apple users generally subject products. Apple will be on the hook for the subset of users that have AppleCare if the SSD fail in large numbers within 3 years of purchase. There's not a lot of good data yet on how these devices fare 2 years down the road performance or durability wise, but I'm certain a lot of work has gone into the SSD that have made the cut.\n", "Q: Is there a dashboard widget for Microsoft Outlook/Exchange calendar? Does there exist a dashboard widget which displays my Outlook/Entourage and Exchange calendar?\n\nA: There are no widgets for OSX for use with Outlook, there are calendar widgets for iCal or Google Calendars, that can be downloaded here but you will need to route all your calendars through iCal or Google calendars instead of Outlook and you probably won't want to do that.\n\nA: Fantastical works with Outlook.\nhttp://flexibits.com/fantastical\n", "Q: How can I change the preferred application for opening \"fmp7://\" URLs from FileMaker Pro Advanced to FileMaker Pro? I have both FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Pro Advanced installed. Because the available licenses for the Advanced product are limited, I shouldn't use it unless necessary. But when neither application is running, my Mac will currently open any \"fmp7://\" URLs in FileMaker Pro Advanced. How do I change this so that FileMaker Pro is opened instead?\n(There's no obvious configuration option for this in either application's Preferences window.)\n\nA: Download and install the excellent RCDefaultApp Preference Pane, which — amongst other things —  lets you declare the default handler for fmp7:// URLs.\n", "Q: AppleScript \"Open With...\" icon I've written an AppleScript app that I use to open certain files with (it sends them to Vim in the Terminal). \nI'd like to set all my .Tex files to automatically open with this app. The problem is this changes the files icons to the blank file icon.\nIs there a way to change the app's icon? In other apps I use (non-AppleScript apps) I know how to \"change\" this icon by replacing it in foo.app/contents/resources but in my app there is no icon there yet. \nIs it possible to add one?\n\nA: See this answer and this answer of mine on SuperUser, where I explain how to create new or edit existing file types, including icons.\n\nA: You can create an icon file named droplet.icns inside the app package inside foo.app/Contents/Resources/.\n", "Q: Photoshop CS issues on Mac Mini PowerPC G4 (1.2) I dont have enough free memory to run PhotoShop CS. I'm looking into external drives to free up space.  I would also like to upgrade OS so I can watch netflix, and maybe would help with streaming video in general. If I upgrade, not sure what to upgrade to as I want to still be able to use PS CS, office X.1, amd maybe dreamweaver MX (less important) since I already have have these and there would be no cost. Any suggestions are much, much appreciated. I don't know many tech terms beyond CPU, HD, Platform, etc. I am not very technical.I did upgrade the CPU myself thanks to youttube but not sure what the speed is now. All I know is I upgraded to the \"maximum\".\nThank You for any help! Hard to type with the delay on this page, forgive typos!\n\nA: General information before we get to the crux of the question: \"PowerPC\" means you're not on Intel. 7 gigs free hard drive space is getting close to insufficient, but I usually don't have problems until I get less than 4-5 gigs. You may want to get an external hard drive and move some of your data files over there to free up space. \nAt 1 gig of RAM, you should probably look into upgrading that. I would expect the machine would work with two gigs, more would be pushing it. iFixit has very complete instructions of how to disassemble and reassemble nearly all Macs.\nYour processor speed is high enough that you can upgrade to Leopard (10.5), but that may not actually improve much for you. For starters, if you upgrade to Leopard, you will no longer be able to run programs in Classic (Mac OS 9). If this is important, don't upgrade the OS. Also, I doubt an OS upgrade will make it easier to run Netflix and other online videos, as that is more of a hardware thing: Netflix, for instance, requires an Intel Mac. (I just tried it on my iBook G4 1.33 GHz, a fairly similar machine to yours, running 10.5 and got the system requirements page instead of the video. Netflix requires Microsoft's Silverlight which requires an Intel processor, so that's never going to work.)\n", "Q: What is the best version of iOS to use on an iPhone 3G? my girlfriend is currently using an iPhone 3G (iOS version 3.1.3 - 7E18) and I've noticed it can be very sluggish. She doesn't use it for much more than the usual messaging/safari/mail. Compared to my 3GS it is pretty terrible.\nI used to have a 3G (still do in fact, and it runs much smoother/faster).\nSo my question is, what is the best version of iOS to run on an iPhone 3G?\nI'm going to downgrade (if necessary, which I think might require jailbreak which I'm not thrilled about) or try a restore and see if that fixes it, but I'm not sure if it's even possible to restore her phone but keep it running 3.1.3.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: iOS is always being optimized, and Apple's OS's are known for running faster than previous versions, even on older hardware. iOS 4.0 was bad on the 3G, but 4.1 is much better.\nAs a rule of thumb, you're always best running the latest version of iOS, unless you're a jailbreaker and/or unlocker, in which case you should run the latest exploitable version of iOS and the baseband.\n\nA: If you get an error message when trying to downgrade to iPhone OS 3.x from iOS 4.x, you can still download an application called RecBoot 1.0.2, and launch the RecBoot Exit Only application to get your device out of recovery mode as the restore most likely actually worked. iTunes is finicky about downgrading.\n\nA: From my experience, 3.1.3 is indeed the best version for iPhone 3G, if you don't want any new or updated app. I've installed 4.2 on an iPhone 3G and it does become slower, though not so bad. If you put side to side a 3G with iOS 3 and one with any version of iOS 4, you'll see the 3 outperforming the 4 for most tasks (other than some native multi-tasking maybe). Other than the slightly faster performance, the best iOS for any iDevice is the latest one, like wjlafrance said.\nUnless it is jailbroken, I can't tell what could possibly make iOS 3 slow. On iOS 4 it is only multitasking that can harm the performance AFAIK. Same issue with jailbreaking - gets slow if you install too much stuff running on the background. And an old device will suffer aging impact only on the battery. Hopefully a fresh restore would solve the \"sluggish\" but I'm afraid it might not.\nAnyway you can easily* downgrade without jailbreaking. On 3G, you just* need the right file, enter DFU mode and option+click on Restore from iTunes.\n* It is that simple, but there is more to it and it can become complicated. If you need more details, try this guide on lifehacker or this another even more detailed one on redmondpie.\n", "Q: can I run two versions of safari side by side On a freshly intalled computer rather then importing my old safari bookmarks (ea wih migration assistant) I want to start anew with no bookmarks. However, from time to time I would like to browse through my old bookmarks (on the 'old safari') to selectively drag a few bookmarks over to the 'new' safari.\nBoth new and old safari's are in fact the same version.(what if the old was leopard and the new was snow leopard, does the old run inside SL?)\nAn extension to switch bookmark libraries wouldn't solve this, as I need both bookmark lists open in a window to drag and drop bookmarks from one to another.\nSo I guess I could use http://michelf.com/projects/multi-safari/ but feel this is more then I need: I wonder if I can do this with both safari's using the same webkit version of the OS (just like camino uses the same webkit as safari and can be open at the same time)\nAlso would it be possible to run the old safari from an external disk, so without it being located in the local applications directory?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Safari does not support multiple user profiles.\nEven if you create a copy of Safari.app and execute it separately, both of them will load the same user profile which lies in your Library.\nBut, if your only requirement is the selective bookmark transfer, then you may export your bookmarks from your old machine as a html page, open that page in your new Safari, and selectively add the bookmarks as you wish.\nIn order to export the bookmarks, you just need to go to File > Export Bookmarks.. and then just open the resulting file from your new Safari.\n\nA: Actually, I think you could trick the OS into letting you do this.  I can think of two ways.  #1 - you could 'sandbox' Safari.  To sandbox is to run it in something akin to a virtual environment.  Changes are not permanently written back to disk, and, access to files outside of the sandbox is restricted.\n#2 - Backup your profile (as nuc said, this is in your Library).  Quit Safari, mark the profile folder and its contents read-only.  It accomplishes a similar result to sandboxing.  Now, in terms of can you drag one over from the other?  Maybe.. I'm not really sure.\n\nA: That approach is more of a straight-to-hard approach. An easier method would be to retain one browser (Safari), and import your old bookmarks into the new Safari under a specifically titled folder to separate them, and sort/delete them at your leisure.\nIf you would like to make it more difficult on yourself and you don't care for FireFox, Chrome, etc. I would suggest using Webkit, since that's the underlying guts of Safari, and the experience will be the most streamlined for you.\n\nA: No - your user has one home folder and both versions of Safari want to use ~/Library/Safari to store their data for you.\nThe nightly webkit lets you run two versions of \"safari\" on the same data. Since the code doesn't exist to have multiple \"personalities\" in Safari - you would have to do that work (or pay someone) to make a simple change and recompile safari for you to have one of your versions store their data in another folder (like ~/Library/SafariOld). That might take someone familiar with the code half an hour of work.\nThe only workarounds that come to mind would be to use rooSwitch to temporarily switch in the old bookmarks for looking around until you decide to import/cull/edit the old set. It won't help with dragging and dropping the bookmarks like you ask. The other workaround would be to use another browser (not safari) to import the old safari bookmarks (or set up the new ones) and then export your new set of organized bookmarks.\n", "Q: sync master apple lossless itunes library to slave AAC itunes library I prefer to listen to my music on my laptop in Apple Lossless at home. On the go however AAC is fine, and a must, as I don't have enough space on my SSD.\nItunes has the feature to automatically convert AL to ACC when syncing with an ipod. Could this be replicated to work with another mac too? I would then have my master library (with AL) aliased to an external drive I hook up when at home, but when on the go it would fall back to my slave library (AAC) on my local SSD. \n\nA: This probably can be achieved by just using iTunes Match, don't know if you're willing to subscribe to this. The master library with AL is getting matched, giving you access to the AAC versions from the cloud. From then on, everything you do to a file in your AL library is getting automatically synced to the iCloud AAC version.\nWhen you're on the go just switch to the local SSD library. Start with an empty library, activate iTunes Match and all your music get's visible without being physically on the device. You could then download all the AAC versions from iTunes or just those you want to have on the device. All changes between your master and this slave library should get synced, you just have to manually download music on your SSD when you add something new to your master library.\n\nA: I know of no way to re-use the AL -> AAC iPod conversion-on-sync for use in a playlist or library.\nIf you already have AAC dupes of your AL tracks, you could\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate-convert all AL tracks into AAC\n\n*Set a smart playlist of only AAC tracks\n\n*Run an Automator action to export the smart playlist to another folder\n\n*Create a new iTunes library\n\n*Set other folder above as the iTunes library for the SSD\n\n*Option-start iTunes to switch between the two libraries\n\n*Re-run the Automator playlist export to feed new tracks into the SSD library folder; import those new tracks into the SSD iTunes library\n\n\nNot a very elegant solution, but perhaps an acceptable compromise depending on your requirements.\n\nA: So I would suggest you a cleaner way, because I believe not all of your tracks are in Apple Lossless, so making a Smart Playlist that returns AAC tracks might return some of your original tracks.\nMy steps are as following:\na) Create a new iTunes library without any tracks\nb) Import all tracks from your old library (Do not copy, there's an option under Preferences that will copy all your imported media to iTunes Media folder, uncheck it)\nc) Convert all tracks to AAC (There's option for quality in Preferences, it's not hard to find, just rather weird, it's Import Settings..., you can choose whatever quality that you like)\nd) After converting all tracks to AAC, those new tracks will reside in your new iTunes library's iTunes Media folder. Copy them to your laptop. And you can delete the new temporary library. Or you can simply copy the whole library folder over, if you'd like to.\n", "Q: iPad VNC client: Edovia Screens: Does it support multiple displays? Does Edovia \"Screens\" support multiple displays?  My Mac has two displays, and I need to be able access applications that open on either one of them.  \n\nA: Screens does let you select a specific display on the fly when you connect to Mac. This is a feature built in Screen Sharing, which is Apple's VNC protocol.\nIf you're connecting to a PC, you can use ports 5901...590x to specific the display to use before connecting.\n\nA: In short: Screens supports multiple monitors but they'll appear as one wide display.\n", "Q: How power efficient are Apple's bluetooth devices? I learned from this post that I can hold the power button long enough to turn off the bluetooth keyboard.\nI used Apple's bluetooth mouse around 5 years ago, and I just threw it away as it was a battery killer. Since then, I never have used bluetooth devices. Ironically, I use Microsoft wireless mouse which lasts months without battery change with Mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*How battery efficient are Apple's bluetooth devices? Normally, how long do you use Apple's bluetooth devices without battery change? \n\n*Do I have to turn off bluetooth keyboard/trackpad whenever I don't use them? Do I have  serious battery drainage if I don't turn them off? \n\n\nA: I have a Magic Mouse and a Wireless keyboard, and I use rechargeable batteries. I charge them once a month, but I'm sure they'll last at least one more. \nAll the recent Apple wireless (Bluetooth) products are very smart about power usage and it really doesn't matter wether you turn them off or leave them on. I turn them off only when transporting them in my bag.\nNote that the battery percentage reported for bluetooth devices is not accurate. It's based on the voltage of the cell, and since it's different in the Alkaline (1.5 V) and the Ni-MH rechargeable (1.3 V) batteries, it's virtually impossible to distinguish between the two. Not to mention the discharge curve of both.\nChanges in 10.6.7 made it more accurate for devices, running on rechargeable batteries - It now treats charge around 1.3 V for 100%.\n\nA: I bought a Magic Mouse shortly after it was released and used it heavily (8+ hours a day) for months until handing it off to my girlfriend, who's still using it on the original batteries. I'd say the battery usage is \"near zero\". \nSometimes, after being off for a weekend, the battery percentage has gone up.

He had turned it off, and back; it prompted him for a password which he entered and he was able to connect and retrieve email.\nI don't know if any other iPhones were having similar issues at the time, which would of indicated a potential server issue.\n\nA: Several of my colleagues that use iphone 6 got this problem before, and this problem only solved by restart the iphone.\n", "Q: Not able to download game applications from App Store Since I got my iPad and iPhone I am unable to download certain applications,\nespecially the games\nIs this due to region restrictions with Apple and South Africa?\nApple recently released the iPad to South Africa and in the Apple Store I see the iPad have Angry birds, etc. loaded on them.\nBut if I try to download it from the App Store I can't.\n\nA: Per my comment above, apps simply do not show up (in iTunes itself, anyone can view the web-page overview versions) in iTunes if they are not available in your region.\nIf you do follow a link to the app specifically, you should get an error message explicitly stating that the application is not available.\nAny other message indicates some other problem entirely.\n\n", "Q: Associating skype contacts with address book After installation of new Skype version for Mac, each time I search for a contact - it gives me few choices for one person:\n\n\n*\n\n*the skype contact;\n\n*the contact from address book with phone number\n\n\nIs there a way to merge these two contacts into one? Maybe by adding custom field to address book or by defining same phone number in skype contact entry?\nAny guides are much appreciated!\n\nA: your mac uses your Address Book as its basis for your contacts (skype is reaching in your contact list to pull people up not the other way around). So your Address Book really is the place where you emerge all of your contacts because other applications can use it to pull up contacts so you dont have to manually transfer all of your contacts to an application that might require them. \n\nA: Mac OS X Lion now allows you to specify a Skype address on your address book contacts.\n\nA: I had the same problem a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, there is no way to merge all your contacts automatically. But and I solved manually this way.\n- search for your contact on the search bar. Once you typed down his or her name, Skype will display several address book numbers for that contact and also his or her skype contact.\n- Choose the number you want to ad to the skype contact. Skype will display the number and under de number it will say \"save number\" and a + button willl appear next to it. \n- Click the + button. It will display a pop up window giving you the chance to search for the name to which you want to link the number. Type the Skype contact name and press add number.\nLike I said, it is not automatic and you'll have to ad every number to every skype contact one by one. Hope it works for you.\n", "Q: How to transfer music from one iTunes library to another using shared library? I would like to transfer music from one iTunes library to another but I tried to drag songs from local library to a shared library and it didn't work.\nIs it possible to do this transfer using just iTunes, without having to manually copy files from one computer to another?\n\nA: Yes it is, if you've set up the iTunes libraries for home sharing. Turn on iTunes on the machine with all the music. Go to iTunes on the machine you want the music on, then open look for other iTunes libraries on the network. If you don't see share libraries you may need to update the menu options in the General settings. Browse to the songs you want highlight them then click import in the bottom of the iTunes window.\nI use this all the time to move songs, movies, TV Shows between my main desktop with a few TB's of storage and the different laptops around the house. This also works between OS X and Windows environments since it's connecting with iTunes.\nEDIT: You can also configure the main iTunes library to automatically sync songs from the other libraries. This would mean that you only need to hook up a monitor once to set up the share the first time. You could also use this time to set up a VNC client on the main machine from which you could access the computer with your laptops and make edits as needed.\n\nA: Assuming that the iTunes Media folder will be in the same path on both machines, then you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your media folder to the new machine. If it lives in /Users/Sorin/Music/iTunes on the source machine, copy it to the same location on the destination machine.\n\n*In iTunes on the source machine, select File -> Export Library to generate an XML file of your library's metadata, including the paths to the media files.\n\n*In iTunes on the destination machine, make sure that the iTunes Media folder is set correctly in its advanced Preferences panel; then, import the xml file you just exported.\n\n\nThe above process should be faster than dragging/dropping files through iTunes, though the initial copy of your media will take time depending on how large it is.\nThis question looks similar and may offer other perspectives.\n", "Q: Is there any alternative to MacPorts? MacPorts became really a pain because it does compile the packages on your machine, like the infamous gentoo and I would like something with a smaller footprint on your machine.\nI know that Fink and other solutions exists but from what I remember form few years ago they are less maintained than macports.\nI would like to read a more informed opinion regarding which solution would be optimal and why. \n\nA: Alternatives for MacPorts\nHomebrew\n\n*\n\n*Uses OS X binary versions when available\n\n*Compiles OS X optimized versions\n\n*\n\n*Compiling usually faster than with MacPorts\n\n\n\n*Easy to use, e.g. to install wget: $ brew install wget\n\n*Tries to separate already installed software from what is installed through brew …\n\n*… while taking advantage of already installed software and libraries (e.g. doesn't install a working version of Perl twice)\n\n*Installing software doesn't need root access\n\n*Actively developed on github\nFink\n\n*\n\n*Uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get\n\n*Easy to use, e.g. to install wget: $ fink install wget\n\n*Can be used to install precompiled packages or to compile everything from the source\n\n*Has a separate directory tree to avoid interference with the system\n\nRudix\n\n*\n\n*Last version 2010-04-10\n\nMacLibre\n\n*\n\n*Has GUI\n\n*Nothing new on the website since 2008\n\n\nA: Yes, you can try Homebrew.\n​​\n\nA: Macports now provides compiled binaries for Snow Leopard and Lion for normal options. \n", "Q: Is it possible to tune OS X so it will execute exe files without having to prefix the command line with wine? I'm writing cross-platform scripts that are executing utilities and some of them are windows executables.\nI would like to find a solution that would not require me to prepend the command line with wine when I run from OS X.\nI know that on Windows it is possible to define executable files based on file extension but I would like to know if this is possible to do on OS X and how.\nI am open to suggestions ;)\n\nA: How about setting all .exe files to \"open with\" wine?\n\nA: Right-click (or Ctrl+click) on any .exe file and select Get Info from the menu (or just select the file and hit Cmd+I). Go the the Open With section in the info panel and choose Wine (depending on your setup, it may already be in the dropdown list, or you may have to select Other and find it yourself). Then click on Change All to set all .exe files to open with the same app.\n\nA: I don't think there is any sort of setting you can change that'll solve this problem exactly. One thing you could try: on the Mac, rename the windows utility, and write a shell script (made executable with chmod +x) that runs that utility with wine.\n\nA: have you tried \"chown -x\" on the files, that should set it to executable.  Works with Ruby & Python scripts, should in theory work with exe.\n", "Q: Netcat -e on Mac OS X I'm a newbie macuser coming from Debian, and I'm a big command line user.\nOne one my preferred one is netcat (aka nc on mac). I especially loved the -e option which enabled to create a process that deals bidirectionnally with the strems.\nUnfortunately, when I use the classic:\nnc -l -p 6666 -e /bin/bash\n\nNetcat does not agree with me, and I get this:\nnc: illegal option -- e\nusage: nc [-46DdhklnrtUuvz] [-i interval] [-p source_port]\n      [-s source_ip_address] [-w timeout] [-X proxy_version]\n      [-x proxy_address[:port]] [hostname] [port[s]]\n\nWhat does that mean? Can I use this command in another way?\nThanks for your help,\nRob\nPS: if someone can edit the tags, would be better -- netcat, nc are not known here :)\n\nA: I've just checked the man page.  Doesn't look like that flag is supported.  I suppose you could download a different version.. (perhaps 'netcat' instead of 'nc').\n\nA: If you install Nmap (debianports) you will also get ncat.\nncat is basically an advanced version of nc with the options like:\n-e, --ssl, --broker, --chat, ...\n\nA: After doing some research, it appears that the netcat distributed in MacOS is a rather old (imported at 2005-10-07) version of netcat-openbsd clone. Here is the header file from the netcat.c hosted at opensource.apple.com.\n/* $OpenBSD: netcat.c,v 1.82 2005/07/24 09:33:56 marius Exp $ */\nThere are three popular versions of netcat in the wild:\n\n*\n\n*gnu-netcat or netcat ver. 0.71\n\n*netcat 1.10 or nc110 (also known as netcat-traditional in debian)\n\n*and the openbsd version (netcat-openbsd, the netcat metapackage points to it) which is in active development.\n\nCurrently only the gnu and 1.10 versions support -e option and it's considered insecure. In the 1.10 version you should compile with -DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE define to enable the -e switch.\nThe easiest way to install this version would be to use homebrew or other ports system (homebrew uses netcat 0.71 source).\n", "Q: Time Capsule alternatives Can someone tell me the best alternative to Apple Time capsule? Common question, I know, but couldn't find it in the list.\nPeople who have actually tried out the alternatives only please.\n\nA: Since there have been no \"hardware\" answers by someone who has used one, I'll add that there are third party drives who support Time Machine.  Just as some examples, LaCie has support in their NAS products and Drobos also have support.  I've used neither, although I have a LaCie d2 Network 2 on order.\nThe cautionary note here is that \"support\" means that they (a) make it possible to connect to the NAS from Time Machine and (b) typically provide size restrictions on Time Machine so that it doesn't eventually consume all free space on the drive.  Apple does not support any NAS other than a Time Capsule, so there is no guarantee that the third party drives won't stop working with a future Time Machine software update, or have other problems.\n\nA: I use tar with rsync and it works very well, it's also scriptable which make it even more powerfull!\n\nA: DéjàVu is a nice System Pref that do the job\nEDIT : The answer stays the same. DejaVu + an external or NAS disk will do the job.\n\nA: I use both, but if I had to ditch TM for some reason, I'd continue to use Arq for backing up to \"the cloud\".\n\nA: You can use CrashPlan, for free, to do incremental backups to another drive, another computer or to a friends computer. As long as you can mount the drive on your Mac, you can backup to it. That means you could use a router that supports sharing a USB-attached drive. Or a NAS box on your network. Or the drive from another machine. You get the idea.\nAnd when you're ready to back up to the cloud, CrashPlan does that too. It's been doing cloud-based backups for me for about 6 weeks now and I'm pretty pleased with how it performs. Initial seeding took a few weeks, but now it can complete the incrementals in an evening.\n", "Q: Airport connection problem, self-assigned IP address, not able to connect On some wireless networks that others can seem to access just fine, my MacBook Pro won't connect, I get an error like this in the Network pref panel:\nAirPort has the self-assigned IP address 169.254.148.134 \nand will not be able to connect to the Internet.\n\nThis occasionally happens with unsecured networks, and also with secured networks where I know the password is right, and the password appears to be accepted.\n\nA: Can also depend on the router.  Some routers allow you to change the 'index' or 'key' that is in use.  IE - you can define say 4 different keys or passwords that the wireless network can use, then you tell it which one you want to be in use right now.\nMy experience has been that Macs will always try to connect using index or key 0, never any other key.  The connector (MB or MBP) has to be using the same index or key number for the wireless handshake process to work properly.\nI've had situations, therefore, where PC's were connecting just fine to a well-setup network and there was no reason the Mac shouldn't - and an hour or so later I figured out that that's what it had been the whole time.\nFrustrating to say the least.  May be fixed now, I think last time I ran into it was an early 10.6.\n", "Q: How can I copy videos and photos to my iPad without syncing? What's the easiest way to get photos and videos on to the iPad without Syncing?\nThe way sync works is ridiculous; its either all the pictures in a folder or nothing. Basically I want the ability to drag and drop random photos with just a computer and cable available.\nNo cloud storage options please.\n\nA: In iTunes, go to the iPad’s (or iPod’s) summary screen. Check the “Manually manage videos” box, and click the “Apply” button. You can then drag videos from your desktop to the iPad without having to sync.\n\nA: DropBox on your main machine would allow you to add both files to your iPad without sync. The iPad should automatically play files it recognizes in the proper application when it sees them there. Dropbox provides 2GB of storage for free so going above that will require payment.\nEdit You can 'star' files if you want them downloaded to the device so you'll have them even if offline.\n\nA: Airdrop via Finder on Yosemite works well for me. Surprisingly fast.\n\nA: Air Sharing allows you to copy files between an iOS device and a computer. No internet is required, but it uses wi-fi rather than a cable, so both devices need to be on the same wi-fi network. It uses webdav so you can connect to the iPad using Finder and drag and drop files as you normally would.\n\nA: You can use something like iPhone Explorer to drag and drop them into the /User/Media/DCIM/100Apple (last one may be different) directory. I know it works with pictures, but I haven't had a chance to test with video. But I don't see why it wouldn't work once the database is updated.\nIf you're jailbroken and transfer a video, that the phone can play, with iPhone Explorer (works on Mac and Windows for iPad and iPod too) or through SSH (with the OpenSSH package from Cydia), iFile can add it to the camera roll (same with pictures, and it doesn't matter where they are if you use the SSH and iFile method). Not exactly drag and drop but you don't have to go through iTunes. iPhone Explorer does not require the iDevice to be jailbroken.\nAlso if you got the VLC Player app before Apple pulled it you can drag and drop almost any video type into the app via the \"File Sharing\" box in iTunes in the App tab. (If the phone is jailbroken you can still get the VLC player from Cydia)\n\nA: If you are just looking to send short videos, I sent them from my computer to my ipad using iMessage. once you receive the message on your iPad, you have the option to share it by clicking the button on the top right. One of the share options is to save it to your Camera Roll. Once it's in your camera roll, you can add it to whatever app you'd like.\n\nA: You can use DC Copy to do this.\n", "Q: Connect computers via ethernet rather than wireless This is my current set-up:\nWireless network, multiple macs connected, two of them are standing next to each other. As I want fast file transfer between those, I've got an ethernet cable between them. With IPv4 turned off (on ethernet) on both of them, and Ethernet on one in the service order, this all works. Kind of. \nBecause the Mac will decide whether it wants to use wireless or wired, it seems like it will only use the ethernet when it transfers bigger files. Is there a way to always let them use wired instead of wireless?\n\nA: When there are 2 routes available, I usually just temporarily Turn Airport Off in Network Preferences when I want to force a transfer (or other network connection) to start over the wired ethernet port.\n\nA: The following should work for you and enable you to choose when to use the direct Ethernet link.  Try this:\n1) Manually assign IPs to the Ethernet interfaces of the two connected Macs.  Use IPs that are in a different subnet than the subnet being used on your wireless network.  FOr example if your Airport network is using 192.168.X.X then use 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 for the wired Ethernet interfaces with a 255.255.255.0 mask.\n2) On both Macs order the Ethernet interfaces after the Airport interfaces in Network preferences pane.\n3) On the computer assigned the 10.0.0.1 IP, use a text editor to edit the \"/etc/hosts\" file and add an entry like \"10.0.0.2 Mac2Ethernet\".  Choose any hostname you want in the place of Mac2Ethernet.\n4) On the computer assigned the 10.0.0.2 IP, use a text editor to edit the \"/etc/hosts\" file and add an entry like \"10.0.0.1 Mac1Ethernet\".  Choose any hostname you want in the place of Mac1Ethernet.\n5) Then, test things out by opening terminal on one Mac and trying a \"traceroute Mac#Ethernet\".  It should only have one hop, directly to the other named Mac\".  Try it in reverse from the other mac as well.  You may also want to test a traceroute to an Internet destination and make sure that it does NOT route through the other Mac but uses the Airport network instead.\n6) Then, when you want to transfer a file from one Mac to the other simply use the alternate hostname Mac1Ethernet or Mac2Ethernet for those Macs and the traffic will only use the direct connected Ethernet interfaces.  For example, on Mac1Ethernet, type command-K in Finder to get to \"Connect to Server\" dialog, then use afp://Mac2Ethernet to connect to the other Mac.\nI'll leave the testing of this specific configuration to you but can tell you that I do currently use something very similar to connect my iMac to a TimeCapsule next to it using directly connected Ethernet.  This allows very fast wired backups for the iMac even though it uses a different Airport network for all other home networking and Internet.\n\nA: Turn off the Airport on one of the Macs. On the other, enable Internet Sharing, sharing your Airport connection by ethernet. This will make all network traffic from the airport-disabled computer go through the other, which will slow things down, but it might be worth it in your case.\n\nA: Go to your network settings and drag Ethernet to the top of the list (the pane must be unlocked and the interface connected for you to be able to change the order). \n", "Q: Problem when updating using Software Update I tried to update Mac OS X using Software Update. But when I tap on software updates, it's checking software updates and listing the available updates. \nI didn't see Mac OS X update available in the list. I am not able to do this. Can you guys please help ?\n\nA: What is your current OS X version ??\nThe latest OS X is 10.6.7 - and if you can't get it through \"Software Update\", then you can download the whole OS X v10.6.7 Update Combo here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1361\n\nA: You may already be on the latest version (check with the menu item  > About This Mac).\nIf not, you may have accidentally “Ignored” the update (⌫ in Software Update or the menu item Update > Ignore Update…).\nYou might try the Software Update menu item Software Update > Reset Ignored Updates (it is only enabled if you have Ignored an update in the past).\n", "Q: Does Skype/Google Voice use 3G or wifi on my iPhone? I'm just curious to know if there is an easy way to tell if your calls coming in on an app like google voice or skype are routed through the data plan or if they are using minutes.\n\nA: Skype and Google Voice act very differently in the way that calls are received on your phone.  Skype is VOIP (Voice Over IP) software, and all calls made using Skype will use your data plan when you're not in a WiFi area.  However, if you have Skype Call Forwarding configured to forward to your iPhone you will be charged per minute just like a regular cell phone call.\nGoogle Voice, on the other hand, will forward calls placed to your Google Voice phone number to your iPhone if you have that option selected.  Inversely, calls made via Google Voice will be placed through your Google Voice phone number.  The end result being, you're making a phone call using your phone's data plan.\nIf you're concerned about using your cell phone minutes, and are on AT&T you can optionally enable the A-List service for a small monthly fee.  If you add your Google Voice number to your A-List, all calls made to and from that number will not be deducted from your regular cell phone plan.\n", "Q: Edge resizing on Mac Finder windows? One of the few ways I think Windows beats the Mac is in letting the user resize a window from any edge or corner, not just from the bottom-right corner. \nI haven't found any software that enables this functionality on the Mac. Does such a thing exist?\n\nA: Afloat, a free product by Infinite Labs, will let you resize a window by pressing ⌘ + Control + Right Click.  Divvy would also work, but Afloat is a free solution.\n\nA: One of the new features that arrived in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the ability to resize a window from any edge.\n\nA: I know you are looking specifically for edge resizing, but one option would be to use software that lets you set up predefined window sizes/locations that you can apply to a window.\nFor example, Divvy lets you create presets or drag your mouse against a small grid to locate the window.  I'm just getting started with it but it seems useful.\n\nA: Although this does not answer the OP's actual question (namely, resizing from window edges), since Afloat ended up been mentioned, I wanted to point out another app similar in purpose to Afloat is Zooom/2.  It has the advantage of letting you choose the key bindings for resize (and other) behaviors it implements.  It's not free, but it works.  (I've used both Zooom/2 and Afloat, and have no ties whatsoever to any of the developers.)\n", "Q: Can I take a still photo with my built-in webcam? I have a MacBook Pro at work, but am new to Macs and have never used the webcam outside of Skype. Is it possible to take a still photo with the webcam?\n\nA: Check out /Applications/Photo Booth.app\n\nA: You can with PhotoBooth. You can also use all kinds of crazy effects. I suggest trying this when you don't have any important appointments later. :)\n\nA: Yes, use the Photo Booth application.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Photobooth in Finder under Applications\n\n*Take picture or a couple of pictures. \n\n*Click Export and choose a directory to save your picture and name your picture if you do not want the default name. \n\n", "Q: My iPhone is over capacity. Is there a way to remove specific data from an iPhone Backup? Let me explain my situation.  I jailbroke my iPhone 4 when the untethered 4.3.1 jailbreak got released last week.  As precaution, I did make a backup of my Cydia apps back when it was 4.2.1 and my iPhone's personal data as well.  When I restored the Cydia apps it had to remove my phone's apps.  The problem is when I restore my iPhone data back on, it does not restore all of my apps due to it being over capacity.  And thus I don't have my app's data.\nSo, I want to remove the photos and movies from my iPhone's backup as they eat up most of the phone's memory.  Is there a way?  Or is there another solution to handle this problem?\nWhat I did so far\nRemove any large Cydia apps.  Still over capacity.\niTunes ver. 10.2.1  Mac OS 10.6.7  iPhone iOS 4.3.1\n\nA: Well since you are using Mac OSX, when you plug in your phone you can do the following to back up your pictures OUTSIDE of iTunes.\nStep 1\nOpen up Preview with your phone plugged in. Go to File > Import Image. You will see it populate all your photos/videos. Save them in a separate folder (maybe somewhere on your desktop), then delete them all from your phone.\nIf you are concerned about mass deleting these files, you can just do it with SSH. This is after you've imported all your images through preview.\nFrom Terminal on your desktop type \nssh root@your-iphones-ip-address-here\n\nWill prompt you with a PW, chances are if you haven't changed it it's alpine or Alpine. Change directories via the following command: \ncd /var/mobile/Media/DCIM\n\nDepending on the amount of images/videos you have you will see 100APPLE/ and maybe 101APPLE/. In the directory type this to remove ALL images and movies in one command\nrm -r 100APPLE/ \nrm -r 101APPLE/\n\nBackup in iTunes now and you have a fresh backup with just numbers/apps/whatever else. You can then import the pictures/videos back if you want after you restore it.\n", "Q: building wine on mac I'm not really a big fan of macports or any package manager that exists for Mac; Im more of a compile from source guy.

Insert the Win7 dvd, boot up from it, and do a \"startup disk repair\" - which should not touch apps or data on the partition, but should restore the umm, boot-ability of said partition.\n", "Q: How can I make my iChat to connect again to chat server when I wake my Mac? Currently, my iChat does not recover my status when Mac is waken from sleeping. It keeps being offline. How can I make it connect to server automatically when my Mac waken?\n\nA: What version of iChat do you have? When I close my computer (thus putting it to sleep), and then reopen it, after 15 seconds or so, it reconnects. I have v5.0.3.  Check to see if you have that version, or whatever the newest version is. If that doesn't help, try reinstalling the program.\n\nA: The iChat plugin Chax will let you do this.\n\n", "Q: Does Locktopus 1.1 work on iOS 4.3.1?

So, go ahead.\n", "Q: On iPad or iPhone, I take a snapshot of the screen looking at the screen sideway, but the snapshot is taken to be in Portrait mode? On iPad or iPhone, I take a snapshot of the screen looking at the screen sideway (Landscape mode), but the snapshot is taken to be in Portrait mode?  So if I send this photo to a friend or post it on Facebook, it will be 90 degree off... \n(I mean taking a snapshot by pressing the Power and Menu button at the same time)\nAny fix or hack to make it work better?  (this also looks like a bug that might be able to go into future release of iOS)\nI can upload it to the computer and use the computer to turn it 90 degree... but what if there isn't a computer around?\n\nA: You should be able to rotate images imported from a camera in iOS' Photos, so the functionality is there. For some reason it's not enabled for synced images or screenshots.\nInstead of using a computer you can rotate images with an app providing the functionality. I think Myles also means this approach. Some free apps capable of image rotation:\n\n\n*\n\n*PhotoPad\n\n*Adobe Photoshop Express\n\nA: The only to fix this problem is to open the Photo in one of the photo editing applications (such as Photoshop Express) and rotating the photo 90 degrees.\n", "Q: Any way to see my PC and Macbook's folders using iPad? Is there a way to do that?\nThe only way i can think of is to use dropbox but it doesn't support some common file types such as .mpg, .mobi, and .epub, and is limited to 2GB.\nAlso, doesn't it make sense if iPad comes with an app on iOS that can do it?\n\nA: I haven't tried either, but there's Cloud Connect Pro that says you can\n\nView and manage files on your Windows, Mac, Linux, or other network services like Dropbox, MobileMe iDisk, Google Docs, or Box.net directly from the iPad [via SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP or WEBDAV]\n\nand FileBrowser to\n\n[a]ccess your NAS [via CIFS/SMB] without needing to turn your computer on.\n\nCCP is clearly more feature-rich (with e.g. integrated VNC/RDP client, printing and SMB server) but also comes with a hefty price tag ($24.99) compared to somewhat more simple FB ($3.99).\nThere's also an Upgrade OS X article that discusses them both.\n\nA: I use Desktop Connect to implement vnc based screen sharing with my Macs. That lets me see their folders just fine.\nDepending on what you're doing, Air display might be a better choice.\n", "Q: How do I maximize window after I've minimize them? I'm a new Mac user and I regularly minimize windows using the Command + M shortcut. Is there a keyboard shortcut to restore these windows?\n\nA: beside Asmus Solution you can use cmd+tab to find your minimize software's windows after you go on select windows hold option and release all the key.\n\nA: The only way I know of is to get into Exposé mode (e.g. press (fn +) F3 on newer keyboards) and then pressing the down arrow key. You will see the currently selected minimised window (in the lower third of the screen) surrounded by a blue shadow and you can select other windows by moving around with the arrow keys. You can then bring any window to the foreground by hitting return.\n", "Q: MacUpdate check running every hour? I have MacUpdate installed (which I got with their Spring Bundle).\nI noticed that it tries to check for updates every hour for some reason. The app itself is not running so it must be some agent or daemon.\nHere's example log entry (with network off):\n06/04/2011 22:33:00 MU App Search[1916] APP KEY 447266 \n06/04/2011 22:33:00 MU App Search[1916] Checking Updates\n06/04/2011 22:33:01 MU App Search[1916] APP KEY 26968 \n06/04/2011 22:33:01 MU App Search[1916] Contacting Updates Server\n06/04/2011 22:33:05 MU App Search[1916] found manual scan, no last notification 2011-04-01 09:17:54 +0200\n06/04/2011 22:33:06 MU App Search[1916] APP KEY 6.282815 \n[...]\n06/04/2011 23:33:00 MU App Search[2036] APP KEY 447266 \n06/04/2011 23:33:00 MU App Search[2036] Checking Updates\n06/04/2011 23:33:01 MU App Search[2036] APP KEY 26968 \n06/04/2011 23:33:01 MU App Search[2036] Contacting Updates Server\n06/04/2011 23:33:03 MU App Search[2036] found manual scan, no last notification 2011-04-01 09:17:54 +0200\n\nI was looking for a setting that could determine the frequency (ideally switch it off completely) but didn't find anything.\nUsing Lingon I found one Agent that's suppose to run every day at 0:35 which would be fine, but as you can see from the log, it's seem to be run hourly.\nAny ideas?\n\nUPDATE\nDid some testing and these are my findings...\nAfter disabling the MacUpdate LaunchAgent it gets re-enabled by MacUpdate Destkop app every time it launches. Same happens if I delete it altogether.\n\nA: You can disable the update mechanism in the preferences. And you can even set the update frequency (weekly, daily, hourly).\n\nUpdate: this is not enough. It won't notify about new updates, but in the background it runs the updater in every hour. I'm looking forward to have an answer for this question as well.\n\nA: The background scanning is used to both keep your updates cache up-to-date and also to display notifications about new updates that are available. The preferences can control how often the notifications are displayed, and the notifications will not display if you have recently run a manual update check and are viewing the recent list of updates available. \nThe process does run for about 5-10 seconds every hour (as you can see in your logs - it ran in 6 seconds) and is designed to be resource friendly and unnoticeable.\n", "Q: Is there any reason to buy the iWork bundle instead of the apps separately from the App Store? Keynote is $19, Pages is $19, Numbers is $19. iWork bundle is $79.\nWhy would anyone want to buy the bundle?\n\nA: I guess it's mostly here for people on Leopard and older version of Mac OS X. Since the Mac App Store only works in Snow Leopard and later.\nIt could also be for people who don't want to depend on an internet connection when they need to (re)install, and want to have the app physically at all time.\n\nA: If you have multiple computers (and are one person) it's easier to buy iWork from the Mac App Store so you don't have to do some many different install processes. If you have multiple computers with multiple users then it's easier to buy iWork in it's box form.\n", "Q: MacPro - Can the two network interfaces be assigned to? Is it possible to control which applications/processes use which network card? So, for example, I could assign different things to different interfaces? Also, is this possible for the different types of connections e.g. Bluetooth PAN, firewire networking and so on?\n\nA: Only if the application itself supports this.  If it does, it will have config files that allow you to specify either an IP address to bind to, or an interface name to bind to.\nYou would then find out your internal IP address by checking the Network control panel or the interface by checking ifconfig through the terminal.\nAs far as I know.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme not accepting ISP cable modem DHCP I've just recently changed the ISP and now have a cable modem, which only has one LAN port. Connecting here requires to use DHCP to get an IP address. Connecting my laptop works just fine and I get an IP immediately.\nWhen I connect my AirPort Extreme to this port instead (with the intension to get the IP address assigned to it), while configuring it to share this public IP, it will not get an IP from the cable modem. It stays on 169.xxx.xxx.xxx and nothing happens. I have tried many different settings to just see if the router can get an IP from the cable modem using DHCP. No success.\nInternally over wireless I can connect all my devices and they get IPs assigned by the AirPort Extreme DHCP, so this works fine.\nAt this point I don't know what might be the problem, but my guess is that the AirPort Extreme has some problem. I googled a bit, but found nothing that would solve this, so I thought someone might know here.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Many cable modems will only provide DHCP for a small number of hosts, possibly only one. Resetting the modem by unplugging its power supply should let it forget what hosts it has provided IP addresses for, so you can start over.\n", "Q: How to connect iPhone 3GS to a computer monitor without jailbreak? I have to do a presentation where I want to demo some apps on an iPhone 3GS.\nIs there a way to mirror the iPhone screen on a computer screen without jailbreaking?\n\nA: For a 3GS, no.\nThere isn't a way on any iOS device aside from the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S.\n", "Q: iTunes videos on a different harddrive? since the TED HD podcast and iTunesU my iTunes library is getting bigger and bigger and thus free space on my MacBook HD smaller and smaller. I'm getting an iPad2 soon and would like to sync my TV shows and some movies as well, but this just doesn't fit into the library any more.\nI already tried to have two libraries, one on an external HD, one on the internal for on the go, but this is kind of complicated and not really 'the apple way'.\nIs there any way to outsource the movies and podcasts to an external library or HD and leave the music on the MacBook?\nThanks!\n\nA: In your Music directory, go to iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies - copy the Movies folder to an external drive.  Then replace the Movies directory in iTunes/iTunes Media/ with an alias that points to the Movies directory on the external drive.\nWhat you'll end up with is iTunes thinking the same directory structure exists, but the Movies alias will point to the external drive.  You may not even need to re-add anything to your library - the file paths should remain the same.\nI have had my iTunes library set up like this for years for the same reasons you list.\nInstructions on creating an alias can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA26514?viewlocale=en_US\n\nA: I followed the guide from MacOSXTips. By holding the option key when adding the files just stay where they are (external HD) and can be used in the iTunes library as well.\nThis seems to be the only solution, as with the symlinks/aliases files cannot be added to the library.\n", "Q: How can I show multiple windows of a single app with a keyboard shortcut? I frequently have more than one window open for a specific app. For example, I have my Thunderbird mail window, and then a new message is a separate window. When I command-tab through my apps (or use Expose to display all apps) it only shows the app, not the individual windows. If, for example, my new message ends up in the background, the only way I can get it back is to control-click on the Thunderbird dock icon and choose the window from the list. This is a pain when I'm working quickly and don't want to take my hands off the keyboard.\nIs there any way I can get all open windows to show with a keyboard shortcut, rather than just the actual apps?\n\nA: See \"Expose\". Activation keys are different on different laptops, so find the shortcuts under System Preferences>Keyboard. On my laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*F9 shows all windows\n\n*F10 shows all windows for the active app\n\n*F11 shows the desktop\n\n\nA: Try typing Fn+F10. If that does not work, try just F10.\n\nA: Use ⌘+⇥ to find a desired app.\nAfter that use ⌘ + ` to find desired windows.\n", "Q: Application to periodically update desktop with new images from Flickr tag search? Are there any applications I can use to periodically download new images from a Flickr tag search and update my desktop picture (preferably with support for multiple monitors)?\n\nA: DeskLickr is a few years old, and I've not tried it, but it should do what you want.\n", "Q: Chrome: Keyboard shortcut to go to Address Bar?

Or am i going about the entire thing completely wrong? In other words, help!\n\nA: Are you burning the ISO file on to a DVD-R as a file or as a DVD image? There's a big difference between the two. Only the latter method works.\nTo burn a DVD from the ISO image, follow this Apple guide:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2087\n\nA: The ISO file is a virtual DVD, not a file that needs to be burned onto one. To turn this virtual DVD into a real one, put a blank in your machine and right click the ISO and select to open it with Disk Utility. Click Burn on the top bar and follow the on-screen prompts.\n", "Q: Should you format your Mac? Back in my Windows days, I used to fully format my PC once a year or so, to start fresh and get rid of some of the slowdowns. It helped.\nWould you recommend the same for Macs? What's the recommended way of keeping the computer running smoothly?\n\nA: I'd say a full format is almost never necessary, though the only thing you'll lose is time.\nI've got an OS X install that I've migrated from computer A to computer B to computer C and back to B and upgraded from Tiger to Leopard to Snow Leopard (all upgrade-installs, no reformatting or anything) over the past 6 years and it works great.\n\nA: Best way to keep it running smoothly is avoiding installing shady software and most of all be very careful if you want to install some cracked stuff. \nKeep your hard drive checked and from time to time verify it for errors (Disk utility -> verify) and fix them if needed.\nThat's what I do to keep my computers (no matter what OS safe).\nJust for the statistics for the above method the last 3 OS's I had in chronological order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows - 1.5 years on Vista (nothing\nwrong here and I actually still keep\nit on my old laptop) \n\n*Linux - 1.5\nyeras on Gentoo linux (came after\nVista on the same machine with\ndual-boot) \n\n*Mac - January - present (after Linux\nI migrated to Mac and still don't see\nany probs at all with the OS).\n\n\nA: You can certainly do so, and it won't do any harm. The question is more of a matter of do you need to? On Windows it's necessary because it doesn't do a great job of keeping your hard disk clean. OS X however is much better at doing so and so it may not really be necessary unless you're experiencing any problems. There's a post on mac.appstorm.net which coveres this nicely.\n\nA: I'd say yearly is definitely overdoing. Macs don't have a registry, so you don't end up with it getting all krufty.\nSince a new Mac OS X version is released every 1.5 - 2 years, I'd say it's not a bad idea to do a clean install and migrate your account from a Time Machine backup each time a new one comes out, or even a more rebuild. That's also a good time to clean out any odd extensions or launch items you added along the way but don't actually use. That's probably worth the effort in better speed and productivity.\n\nA: For recommended ways of keeping your computer running smoothly, please see my answer to a similar question: \"Why is my Macbook Pro getting so slow?\"\n", "Q: Status of Multitasking in iPad2? iPad 2 has the same OS however a new dual core processor should allow a workaround this limitation and allow for app-switching by freezing whatever apps are inactive at the moment.

I hope there is no problem in rendering Latex/Mathjax\n\nA: With iOS 4.2 and later, both the iPad and iPad 2 will allow multitasking by freezing apps in the background. Some things, such as playing music, will run in the background. Therefore, you will be able to do all of the things you want, but you will only be able to look at one at a time.\nNo, the SE sites do not look like that. I used the Develop menu in Safari to change the user agent, and it rendered exactly the same for the iPad as for the default view. However, it is different for the iPhone (still not the same as the page you linked).\n\n", "Q: How do I check how many RAM slots I have in use? I own a 2010 13\" macbook, and I'd like to do a RAM update from 2gb to 4gb.\nBefore I buy brand new 2x2gb ram, I'd like to make sure that my macbook has 2x1gb or 1x2gb ram slots.  I mean, if both slots are used or if there's only 1 used.\nIs there a command line to have that information?\n\nA: Go to apple menu > About This Mac > More Info and click on \"Memory\" on the left. That should give you detailed information about your RAM.\n\nA: The System Information app has this information (and a lot of other info about your computer). Access it by going to the Apple menu (top left of your screen), selecting About This Mac, and clicking the More Info button.\nFire up the app and click on the Memory tab. You'll get a visual representation of how much memory you have and how it's installed. There is a rectangle for each memory slot, and each rectangle will be labeled \"Empty\", or with the capacity of the chip inserted.\n\nFor even more info, go to File-> System Report.\nIn the new window that appears, click Memory in the list on the left. It will show you the number of slots and what's in each one. In the below screenshot, there is one empty bank. It's the one with the Size, Type, Speed, and Status as Empty.\nIf none of yours say empty, you've got something in every slot.\n\nNote that if you have an older version of OS X than Lion, you won't have the visual representation.

I downloaded the demo after noticing constant network activity on my school wifi - turned out to be mDNSresponder handling Bonjour traffic constantly, due to the huge popularity of MacBooks/iDevices at my school.

How do I remove duplicate songs from my iTunes library?\nIs there an easier way than just ⌘ Command + Click every other song in the list?\n\nA: Apple doesn't have anything natively to select duplicate files so, unfortunately, you'll have to resort to a paid solution like Dupin or you could try Randy's Träume's script.\nI haven't used either so I can't vouch for how well they work, but forums I found relating to this problem point to Dupin frequently so that might be your best bet if you don't mind spending a little coin.\n\nA: iTunes does have a way to show duplicate songs, in your library and in playlists.\nFile > Display Duplicates\nRemember that the playlist has to contain more than one track/video/podcast for the \"Display Duplicates\" option to show.\n\nA: I am very happy with Corral iTunes Dupes script, which I downloaded from Doug’s Scripts years ago. It seems to be gone now, but I found a modification here.\n\nHowever, it’s a PPC app (pretty old!), which you have to convert to Intel architecture by dragging it to AppleScript Editor.app and saving it as Application.

Under the General section of a file's File Info, there is a checkbox for Stationery Pad and Locked. The Locked option is pretty straightforward, but what does Stationery Pad do?\n\n\nA: Basically, it tells an app opening the file to open a copy.\nYou do this on files that you want to use like templates. Since the app is given a copy, you'll never accidentally change the original.\nBasically, it automatically copies the file into its original location (as 'name copy') and lets you work on the copy.\n", "Q: Apple Shortcut Icon I'm pretty sure this is the best site for the this question, if not please feel free to point in a different direction,\nI am using the Mac version of Eclipse and I'm stumped as to what the Keyboard Shortcut for \"Run as..\" is.\nThe image looks like this:\n\nI recognize the COMMAND key and the OPTION key, but whats the X key?\nThanks!\n\nA: You hold down ⌥+⌘ simultaneously, then you press the X which open a small yellow popup like this:\n\nwhere you then press J - and after that you release ⌥+⌘.\n\nA: That's the X on your keyboard.\nIn Eclipse you have to press the ⌥ ⌘ X simultaneously and then release all of them and press J.\n", "Q: How can I receive FM radio broadcasts on my iPhone 4?

Easy to install, set up and use, and according to my wife (who is the main user of this device in our household), it doesn’t seem to drain the iPhone’s battery any faster than with normal operation.  The only downsides seems to be the lack of multitask (which should be correctable through a software update) and the situation with answering phone calls.\n\nIf I get an iPhone, I will get this as well.\n\nA: The iPhone 4 does not have a radio tuner. All it has is the appropriate cellular band, WiFi, and Bluetooth. In short, no there is no easy way to do this.\nSome radio stations make apps so you can stream their content via the internet, or offer live streams. I would check out the radio station's website to see what they have available.\n\nA: It was released in 2009 and the last documentation I can find shows that the Griffin iFM Radio Receiver for iPhone and iPod did work with iOS 3. You should do more research or be OK with it not working as I can't be sure it's compatible (but don't see why it wouldn't be) with the iPhone 4 as a dock accessory.\n\nA: I use an app called Fstream, you can make favorites of any radio station with an internet stream!\n\nA: OK. if iphone by default doesn't have FM Receiver  then this could be a good solution\nhttp://store.apple.com/dk/product/TY512ZM/B?fnode=MTY1NDA0Mw&mco=MTM3NzE3Mjg\n", "Q: iPad uses for Computer Engineers? I've had my original iPad for a while now, but haven't used it that much (other than for couch browsing and stuff like that). I was wondering if there was a way I could be using it to it's full potential during my University run. I'm in computer engineering and that requires me to be programming alot (java, c, python, etc), building circuits, project management and stuff like that. \nIs it worth buying a stylus (one that is precise and that can be used to draw circuits on the fly)? I was thinking of using it to program quick python scripts by VNC'ing into my desktop at home and using vim to edit. \nIs anyone using the iPad for the same thing? Hopefully someone will know how to help me with this issue.\n(Sorry if this is off-topic. I feel like I'm legitimately asking for help here)\n\nA: You can turn your ipad to superb engineering/coding device with buffer editor.

That is, without scanning through the 4000+ items in my Camera Roll and looking for the video icons.\nEdit: Just to clarify, I'm not looking to delete all the videos, just enough to free up some space.\n\nA: Sorry for the self-answer, but I found a way to do it quickly using just the iPhone and no third-party software.\nIn iOS 4.3, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Camera.app\n\n*Click the photo thumbnail to view the photo library\n\n*Click Camera Roll to view all photos\n\n*There's a capsule button at the top that says 'All|Photos|Videos'. Select videos\n\n*Press the Export icon - you can now tap on videos to select them before hitting Delete.\n\n\nNot sure why this functionality is not available from Photos.app, but there you go.  Thanks for all the other answers.\n\nA: You can in iTunes on the Photos tab de-select \"Include videos\" - then all videos on your iPhone will be deleted - when you do a sync.\nOtherwise you need to manually delete the videos one by one from your iPhone. \n\nA: If I'm understanding your question correctly, you want to delete individual videos from the iPhone and but not in iTunes. I use a program called iPhone Explorer (PC or MAC). Once installed, connect the iPhone to computer and iPhone Explorer should find it. Drill down to <100APPLE>. That is where I find the videos listed.\nGood luck.\n\nA: This is an answer that means you must hook your iPhone up to a box running OS  X.\nYou can use Image Capture in OS X to select individual photos/video on your iDevice, and import/delete them. You can sort the files by \"kind\", that would show videos as \"mp4\", \"mov\" and so on.\n", "Q: Is it safe to provide your raw system profile to software vendors for tech support? I have a very expensive piece of software that began crashing after a recent system update, which presumably broke something. Unfortunately, the system logs the app throws aren't detailed enough for me to debug it myself.\nThe software vendor has asked for my complete system profile: is that a safe thing to do? Is there any sensitive information contained in the system profile that should make me think twice about providing it?\nI know my LAN hostname would appear, which I don't consider a problem, as well as my username (which would show up in paths).\n\nA: The biggest question is, how much do you trust the vendor? If you have a decent relationship with them and they are honest, there isn't too much to be worried about - however I would definitely not send the serial number or UUID. If someone were to get a hold of it, they could request bogus things for it like a warranty repair, get a replacement, never send in an original, and use a bogus credit card number as collateral (Like a gift card with $5 on it). Then when it comes time, you might need something fixed, and Apple will say no because of that shady stuff in the past.\nHowever if you are uncomfortable with any of this and you do have a good relationship, just ask them what they want specifically so nothing additional gets sent.\n", "Q: Sync picasa with iPhoto Is there any way to sync my iPhoto photos with picasa?

Let's just say this: I've never had a problem watching a video on my iPhone or iPad and noticing bad motion blur or odd artifacts.\n\nA: 120 Hz is exactly 2x refresh rate for room lighting in the USA. You sure you won't set up unwanted interference? It may be subtle, but it might become tiring.\nI'm not sure refresh rate is that important with modern non-CRT displays. The difference between min and max lumens is significantly lower these days than with the old technology, isn't it?\n", "Q: How do FaceTime and Push Notifications work on wifi-only iOS devices? Simple curiosity question. \nHow does FaceTime and Push Notifications work on Wifi only devices? I mean does the WiFi stays always on to achieve a continuous connection to Apple's servers?\nI have older iPad and iPod touches and they don't have Wifi on when the come from sleep. Is that the same thing with newer models?\n\nA: For what it's worth, my iPod Touches' (2g and 3g) WiFi remains on when the screen is off, and I do get push notifications from various things (in fact, as I was typing this I got one from Ambiance).  If you go out of range of known networks and \"Ask to join networks\" is turned on in the WiFi settings, you of course won't get push notifications unless you turn the screen on and accept an open network.  The Apple battery life optimization page has a little more information, including how to control on a per-application basis what push notifications will work.\n\nA: This is mainly due to how Push Notifications are designed in iOS. If the device does have a connection, it will be pushed to you through Apple's servers. Because of how push works (mainly with a device checking in now and then to say 'heres where I am'), you can get push notifications while the device is asleep. The notification comes through and pushes to the device.\nWith iOS 4, there is also the option for developers to use local push notifications. This mainly works by just setting a designated notification at some point in the future. \nUpdate: According to this Apple Support Document, if the screen is on, push comes on at any time. If screen is off, checks every 15 minutes. \n", "Q: 5.1 surround sound via optical out without receiver I have a 2010 Mac mini and I would like to output 5.1 surround sound from it. \nThe optical audio out is the way to achieve this, but I don't want to have an audio receiver, 5 times bigger then the mini. \nI know there is the Logitech Z-5500 and the new Z906 that can do direct optical audio-in, but it seems to be the only option. \nIs there other speakers with optical-in or small/cheap adapter?\n\nA: If you want to have 5.1/7.1 (multichannel) audio, you can do it via the optical out (mini-toslink), the HDMI or the Mini-Display Port.\nOn the receiver side, you must have a decoder, able to decode the stream (PCM for 2 channels and DD/AC3/DTS and their variants) and convert it to analogue signal.\nI had the same dilemma when I got my ATV2, I wanted something to be able to utilize my optical SPDIF, and to be able to decode Surround sound. After doing some research, there were several solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optical->RCA analogue convertors. Stereo only, like GefenTV. This doesn't do multichannel.\n\n*A small size 5.1 Decoder - you can read the HD Audio Rush review here.\n\n*A Logitech Z-5500.\n\n*Full-blown 5.1/7.1 amplifier.\n\n\nPersonally I decided to go with the amplifier and bought a Pioneer 7.1 receiver.\n", "Q: Converting spoken word audio files into text I've been working on transcribing a lecture series from audio to text files.  There are just over 20 lectures, and each one is about an hour long.  Using VLC Player, I'm able to slow down the speaker's words to a rate that I can keep up with.\nHowever, it's extremely slow going, and it takes so much concentration that I can barely get through a third of a lecture before I have to take an extended break.\nThe thought had occurred to me that I would be better served by using some kind of speech recognition software, and then proofreading the computer-generated result.\nThis is likely to be a one-time thing, so while I don't mind using commercial software to get the job done, it would be preferable if it wasn't too expensive (or free; free is always good).\nCommand-line solutions are fine, too (:\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: My experience is that unless you get a very good speech to text solution, you are simply letting yourself in for a lot of frustration. You'll be spending more time making corrections to garbled transcriptions than you would have spent typing from the start.\nThere's a reason there are not many effective solutions on the market: this stuff is HARD!\nThe Dragon engine from Nuance is the best I've tried.\n\nA: The best I could find for Mac was MacSpeech Scribe, from Nuance Communications, Inc. It is $150, which definitely is a drawback, and there doesen't seem to be other alternatives. There is a free app for iPhone, and there might be one for iPad too, but I beleive they have limitation as to the amout of time you can record allowing just up to 60 seconds. Aside from this, the speech is sent to the servers of Dragon, and then sent back to you: I dont know how efficient it would be to be chopping your lectures to 1 minute parts and s\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Encountering High Latency I'm encountering latency trouble with my 15\" 2011 Macbook Pro (running 10.6.7) when on an 802.11n (5GHz) wireless network hosted by a Time Capsule (version 7.5.2).  When I ping the Time Capsule, the ping numbers are all over the place, like so:\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=216 ttl=255 time=3.461 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=217 ttl=255 time=236.725 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=218 ttl=255 time=157.924 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=219 ttl=255 time=79.511 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=220 ttl=255 time=1.295 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=221 ttl=255 time=0.833 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=222 ttl=255 time=150.669 ms\n\n226 packets transmitted, 226 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.718/115.353/303.004/96.717 ms\n\nThe location of my computer doesn't seem to matter.  My signal shows up consistently at four bars, and I get the same ping results whether I'm in a different room, different floor, or right in front of the Time Capsule.\nA second 15\" unibody Macbook Pro (Mid 2009, also running 10.6.7) doesn't have this problem on the same network.  All pings to the Time Capsule from this second machine report <4 ms.\nIf I connect my computer via ethernet to the Capsule, I get a solid <1ms ping, as expected.  Only the wireless appears to have wild jumps.\nI have tried resetting my network settings (deleting all network configurations from the library), disabling IPv6, changing my \"Network Location\", resetting the PRAM, resetting SMC, recycling power on the Time Capsule, but none of it seems to have had any effect.  I've tried to make sure I have no programs running in the background - Software Update has been turned off and running lsof -i on Terminal only reports SystemUIS as having two open IPv4 connections.  There is also no significant network traffic taking place, so it's not a matter of congestion.\nAny ideas on something else I can try?  I'm sort of at a loss as to why one computer is fine and this one is not.\n\nA: Edit:  Apple released two updates for the MBP this week, including an EFI update.  While neither update explicitly mentioned wireless connectivity, the update seems to have partially fixed the problem.  After installing both updates, I get a pretty consistent 3-5 ms ping with a very very occasional spike to 100.  At least it's much better than before.\nIn the meantime, the trick below still works if you want a 1 ms response instead.\n\nThere's an interesting tip from someone on Apple's discussion forums that can work as a workaround.\nIt appears that if the network card is inactive for more than 200 ms, it powers down and has to be powered up to send network traffic again, hence the random spikes.\nBut, if you can keep the network card active (at the cost of a small amount of CPU power and some extra traffic), then the latency goes away.\nThe command recommended by seanfromcolumbus was:\nsudo ping -i .2 192.168.1.1\n(The -i .2 specifies an interval of 200 ms)\nIndeed, with this running, I get consistent results of <2 ms.\nOriginal Post\n\nA: I did a Time Machine backup and wiped out my existing installation then did a fresh install of Snow Leopard. After that I installed the 10.6.7 combo update just to verify that it was the cause of this problem and it IS! I did yet another fresh install and then I only installed the 10.6.6 combo update and the rest of the regular application updates. Now everything is back to normal. With 10.6.7 I was getting insane ping response times back from the gateway... like 350ms...800ms..600..245.. etc... now everything is back to normal and I get the expected <1ms or the random 1-5ms... I don't know what Apple did with 10.6.7 but it destroy's wifi.\n", "Q: How to charge iPad (v1) on a Windows device I have an iPad (first revision) and want to charge it using my Windows laptop. It doesn't want to charge and I've read quite a lot about it now (this one here amongst others via Google), but I haven't found a complete working answer.\nEdit: I'm not so much interested in the why. But more in a practical solution, preferably without any hardware costs. Can someone give a HowTo on charging an iPad on Windows devices?\n\nA: An insufficiently-powered USB port will charge an iPad, just slower than a high-powered one. \nWhen you plug the USB cable into your laptop the iPad will say \"Not Charging.\" However, when the screen is off it is in fact charging. As soon as you turn the screen on again the battery area will say \"Not Charging,\" too, but again, with the screen off it will charge.\nTest it yourself: before plugging in the cable check the battery percentage. Then plug it in and leave the iPad off for 30 minutes; when you turn the screen back on you'll see that the percentage has increased.\nIn my case it takes several hours to charge from 50% to 100%, but at least it's charging.\n\nA: If your iPad won't charge when connected to your Windows laptop, the most likely reason is because the USB port you are using doesn't provide enough power for the job.\nMacBooks in the last several years are designed to provide sufficient power via USB, but I can't comment on your Windows machine. Sounds like that USB port you are using simply doesn't provide enough power to charge the iPad.\nThere's no real practical and easy \"fix\" for this on a laptop. See if the USB port outputs more power when you plug-in the laptop to the wall… though it's unlikely…\nSorry.\n\nA: An update of the motherboard is necessary. Gigabyte, MSI, and ASUS have issued updates.\nSource: Engadget\n\nA: You need a high power USB port which can provides a 1100 mA output.\nOr you can install ASUS AI Charger on your device, to tune your USB port to have high power output.\n", "Q: What causes all iWork apps to have blank, unusable documents after a reinstall?

Have you tried disabling that on the airport and rebooting?\n\nAlso be sure you are not editing a profile that is not active on the Airport. I have fallen into that trap once or twice every so often.\n\nA: I would turn off your remote access until you know your home network isn't public so that someone doesn't access it besides you.\n\nA: I am not familiar with the Airport Extreme admin but it looks like you have SSH remote login turned off in the first dialog, and then in the second dialog add it manually mapping external port 22 to internal ip 191.168.1.10 port 22. What you are seeing is someone (usually a script kiddie) trying a dictionary attack against your system. \nIf you must have ssh access then I would suggest running it on a non standard external port, which you map to the internal address and port 22. On Linux boxes to prevent this type of activity I normally install DenyHosts which seems to have a Mac port available. This monitors the logs of the ssh daemon, and adds the ip of any system that had a configurable number of failed login attempts within a time window to /etc/hosts.deny \n", "Q: Why are iPads so expensive at amazon? I have some money at my amazon account that don't seem to be transferable to Europe so I was thinking about redeeming them and buying an iPad. After a small research I have found out following things :\n\n\n*\n\n*Compared with prices at apple site, amazon is very expensive. For example, a basic 16 GB 3G model costs $629 at apple site while starting at $850 at amazon. Does this have something to do with the shortage of iPads now (i.e. there will be a price drop as soon as they become available), or are there some taxes not included in the apple price that make amazon prices higher in general ?\n\n*Both at apple and at amazon there is a provider to choose when selecting a 3G model (AT&T vs. Verizon). I live in Austria, Europe and would probably use some of the local providers, if at all. Do you think it is possible, are there some contracts one has to sign or anything that would prevent me from that ? I would mainly use the iPad for development and I really would want one with GPS, having a 3G as an option is more of a nice-to-have for me. Still it's interesting to know whether it's somehow blocked for US market or not.\n\nA: *\n\n*Just looking at the entry on amazon.com, it appears to be because Amazon doesn't offer it directly, but sellers that use Amazon's store front do.  They are likely selling them above Apple's price because of the high demand vs. lack of supply.\n\n*You can buy one of the 3G models without a contract; the main reason you have to choose a provider is because of the different wireless technologies (GSM vs. CDMA).  This is unchanged from the original iPad (I did not have to buy/enter into a contract with it).\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you follow the Available from these sellers link you'll see that none of them are actually sold by Amazon; rather, they're sold by independent resellers who are marking them up because they can.\n\n*The GSM version (AT&T) should work fine there, I know I've heard of people doing it. I can't guarantee it, though, as it may depend on your carrier.\n\nA: If you want to use the iPad in another country, get the AT&T model. The Verizon model uses CDMA and is not compatible with most carriers, but the AT&T model uses GSM, which is used by almost all carriers. There is no contract, but you will need to get a different SIM card which works with the carrier you choose.\nAs far as I know, Amazon raised the price to increase profit, and will eventually lower the price to match competitors.\n", "Q: Can I use my Jawbone ICON to listen to Netflix on my iPhone4? Question says it all. Is there some config to do this? Phone is not jailbroken.\n\nA: I've just got an ICON last weekend and it plays all audio output I've thrown at it (phone calls, podcasts, games). Netflix itself, I couldn't test since we don't have that here in Europe, but I don't see why it should be any different than the other apps.\nWhat is important, though, is that A2DP support is installed on the ICON. In my case, it was out of the box, but apparently that's different with older ones. In that case, you apparently need to go to http://mytalk.jawbone.com and install a software update for your headset.\n", "Q: Finder says I have 20GB free. Why does Bootcamp say I don't have 10GB free? I'm trying to partition my Macbook Air's SSD for dual-boot with Boot Camp (which I've done several times before)... however, it's not seeing 10GB free, yet I have 20.56GB free as per Finder, and Disk Utility sees 10.9GB unused space.  \nWhat's going on?  How can I force this to work?  Can I use disk utility and image to an external drive and restore?  Would vastly prefer an easier method of course\n\nA: You may be just reading the wrong figure in Disk Utility, have a look at the quote below from the apple discussion forums\n\nDisk Utility will show two different\n  \"free\" readings, depending on where\n  you look.\nSounds odd, but they're for different\n  purposes. The larger figure, which the\n  Finder and other things will use, is\n  the total free space available.\nThe second is the amount of free space\n  available for a new partition. It's\n  shown when you select the top line for\n  the drive, click the Partition tab,\n  then select a partition, the\n  \"Available\" amount may be smaller. \nThis is because partitions, unlike\n  folders, must occupy contiguous space\n  on a disk. The data on your OSX\n  partition is scattered over it, not\n  all nicely packed together. That's\n  normal, as you add, update, and delete\n  files, not every nook and cranny is\n  used again immediately.\nBut whether there's 7 GB free or 18,\n  that probably isn't enough to be\n  adding a partition; it's probably too\n  little for OSX to operate well.\n  There's no \"hard and fast\" rule, but\n  you should always have at least 10 GB\n  or 10% of your OSX drive free; many\n  folks say 15% or more.\nYou could back up your drive (on two\n  different HDs, to be safe), reformat\n  it to 2 parttions, then restore the\n  backup. But it's going to be very\n  tight, and you'll likely have\n  performance problems because of it.\nTry to delete anything you don't need,\n  and/or offload stuff you don't use\n  often and delete it.\n\n\nA: Boot camp wants 10GB of continous space, if there is even a little file somewhere cutting that 10gb it shows the error message.\nHow I got around this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up disk utility and shrink your primary partition down by about 12 GB, in effect making 12 GBs of un-partitioned space. (WARNING: this might kill some data at the end of the disk but for me everything seemed to be ok)\n\n*Then I repartitioned the primary partition back to the full amount, in effect creating 12GB of contiguous empty space.\n\n*Run Boot Camp Assistant and no more \"10 GB\" error message!\nAlternatively I though about looking in to defragging the hard drive.\n\nA: Do you have TRIM enabled ??\nIf not you can do it like this: http://osxdaily.com/2011/03/27/enable-trim-ssd-mac-os-x-10-6-7/\n\nA: See solution at http://datafilos.blogspot.cz/2012/04/boot-camp-assistant-error.html that helped me.\n\nA: 10.9 is perilously close to the 10GB required. I suggest you arrange things so you have 12GB reported free by Disk Utility and then try again. However, I'd be more concerned abot the reporting discrepancy.\nThe fact you have Finder reporting a different amount of free space than Disk Utility tells me something is screwed up with your data. They should both report the same. I would think it worthwhile to backup your disk, reformat it and copy your data back, file by file. Better safe than sorry.\n", "Q: Looking for a combined Clock/News/Weather/Calendar iPad app I'm looking for an app I can leave running and that shows me all necessary info at 1 glance without any need for interaction.\nIdeally, it should contain\n\n\n*\n\n*a clock\n\n*good, concise news\n\n*weather forecast\n\n*list of my next appointments\n\n*subjects of my unread emails\n\n\nOther people might also like\n\n\n*\n\n*rss feeds\n\n*twitter feed\n\n\nI already searched for such an app for half an hour and found nothing. Well except for a Dashboard app that was rejected by Apple because it was expandable and looked like the os x dashboard.\nThere are alternative calendar apps, there are weather apps that show the time, there are twitter apps, rss readers, email apps. Surely somebody has combined all of them?\nCan somebody pinpoint me to such apps, or explain why they don't exist? Thanks.\n\nA: Consider Panic's Status Board app: it includes configurable modules for everything you've asked for.\n\nA: I'm looking for a such app myself and so far I've found one DeskMate Pro. Maybe not ideal, but much better than the other apps.\nHope it will help you.\n\nA: Notification Center on iOS 5 fits the bill as you can configure it to list the notification in your preferred order and it floats above all programs running whenever you wish to see the notifications.\n\nA: I'll answer myself. There is no such app.\nThe main reason is probably the rejection of that Dashboard app, which made other devs afraid in losing their invested development time if it gets rejected as well.\nFuture iOS updates might introduce a Dashboard feature, which might be similar to what I was wishing.\n\nA: You could achieve some of this without an app at all: put iGoogle widgets for the features you desire on your iGoogle page, then keep a browser window open to that page in Safari in your iPad. \nThere are roughly a billion iGoogle widgets to choose from, and they include widgets for weather, calendars, news, Twitter, RSS, and more.  You can choose the color theme too.\nThe main problems with this approach would seem to be that the display of information is not as compact on the screen as you could achieve with a custom-coded app, so it may be a problem to fit everything that you want so that you can see it all at once.  Also, I haven't figured out a way to make the Google search bar go away, and it takes up an unfortunate amount of space at the top of the page (less so in the vertical orientation on an iPad, but more in the horizontal orientation).\n", "Q: HTML / CSS / Javascript editor for the iPad? I'm interested for a code editor for my iPad.\nI've made a search on Apple Store for \"HTML\", and I've got a huge amount of results..\nCan anyone recommend any of them?\nIt would be nice to have syntax-highlighting, to be able to open many files simultaneously (tabs?) and a nifty way to import, export files. Dropbox would be perfect!\n\nA: I think the best one out there is called Textastic. It supports FTP, DropBox and WebDav and has a keyboard geared for editing code. It also has syntax highlighting.\n\nA: There is also Diet Coda from Panic, designed as a companion for Coda but it can certainly be used independently. \nUnfortunately, it lacks support for Dropbox syncing. iCloud syncing exists if you use the App Store version of Coda. \n\nA: You might also try Kodiak JavaScript: http://www.becomekodiak.com/kodiak-javascript.html. It has syntax highlighting, tabs and keyboard extensions.\nNote that I am a co-author of this app, but I hope it is okay to advertise it here, because it seems to be related to the question asked.\n\nA: +1 for Textastic, which is my fave as well. But Gusto deserves a mention as the other top code editor for iPad.\nYou can't go too far wrong either way. I ultimately preferred Textastic because it is less web-oriented and more of a general programmer's editor. It supports more languages out of the box, allows custom roll-your-own syntax highlighting definitions, and has a really usable cursor navigation scheme.\nBut meanwhile, Gusto has one big killer feature for the web developers: a built-in browser for remote previewing/testing after you upload your code to the server. Textastic can do local preview of HTML and Markdown, but that's really no substitute for seeing your work in place on the server. Granted, you can multitask on over to Safari from Textastic, but Gusto just makes round-tripping your web code that wee bit easier.\nLong story short...if you're mostly a web dev (which I'm not), Gusto deserves a look.\n", "Q: Can the mid-2010 Macbook be used with the Apple Remote? I know that the remote works with units that have an IR sensor. The system profile has listings for hardware that both is and is not installed but, I don't see a listing for an IR unit.\n\nA: Starting 2010 it is only the Macbook Pro's that support IR.\nThe last Macbook that supported IR was the 13\" mid 2009, and the last Macbook Air was mid 2009\n", "Q: Can the mid-2010 Macbook support more than 4GB of RAM? I know of sites that sell 8GB sets for the MacBook. Apple states that they can have up to 4GB. One of my co-workers got her first gen MacBook to 6GB. Can anyone confirm that 8GB is recognized in last year's MacBook?\nEDIT: My model is MacBook7,1.\n\nA: It depends on your particular model, but I believe that the answer is YES!  The great people at Other World Computing sell RAM upgrade kits for MacBooks.\nTo be sure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple -> About This Mac\n\n*Click More Information.\n\n*Look at the Model Identifier.\n\n\nIf it is MacBook 5,1 or 6,1 or 6,2 you can put 8GB of RAM in it.\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Apple_MacBook_MacBook_Pro/Upgrade/Macbook_selector\n\nA: Yes, it supports up to 8GB of memory. Make sure that memory is 1066 MHz, not 1333, or you'll be unable to boot to MacOS.\nIf you are unable to find 1066MHz DIMM, you could be able to re-flash the SPD chip of a 1333MHz DIMMs using a technique I described at the Apple Discussion Board. Note that not all 1333MHz chips can be flashed.\n", "Q: How do I add a user to Print Administrator group but not full administrator? He unplugged the printer and plugged it back in. OS X (10.6) asked for the print administrator password. I would like to add the user to that group but not the full administrators group. How do I do that?\nThis is for a stand-alone home Mac. By stand-alone I mean not part of a corporate login or administration.\n\nA: Run this Terminal command (as an administrator), replacing \"usersaccountname\" with the user's actual account name:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -a usersaccountname -t user _lpadmin\n\nWhen it prompts you, enter your password (it won't echo).  That user should now be able to administer printers.\n", "Q: How to activate new iPad without disclosing credit card number? I bought my mother an iPad 2 as a gift for her birthday, hoping that it would enable my toddler son to do Facetime with his grandmother.\nI tried to walk her through the activation process (over email) by having her download iTunes to her Windows laptop, etc.  She managed to do that much, but when the activation process asked her to create an Apple ID and give a credit card number, she refused to proceed.\nI can't imagine that she would even buy an app, or music, or a book.   I thought the device would be worth it just for mobile Safari, Facetime, and the other built in apps.\nIs it possible to activate the device without creating an Apple ID?  If not, is it possible to get around the credit-card number field? \n\nA: You can use most of iPad's built-in apps without an Apple ID, such as Safari, maps, mail, camera. However, certain ones do require an Apple ID such as Facetime. You can create an Apple ID without a credit card by using an iTunes gift card, or following the URL in vcsjones' answer.\nIf you want to use the iPad without an Apple ID, select these options at setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't have an Apple ID or forgot it\n\n*Set Up Later in Settings\n\n*Don't Use\n\n\nThis is useful because you if enter your Apple ID at setup, it will automatically login you into iCloud and sync all your iCloud data. If you skip the Apple ID at setup, then you can enter it later for App Store downloads without syncing all your iCloud data.\n\nA: I think you are going to need an iTunes account, but you can get around the need of a credit card. You can follow Apple's support documentation on how to setup an iTunes account without a credit card. You can use a Mac to make a free account that works on iOS and iOS to make a free account that works on Mac. Once your iTunes store account is set up once, you might want to avoid creating a second one since they cannot be merged later.\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating an iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store account without a credit card - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204034\n\nA: Open iTunes without account and try to download a free app. Then create a new id and click on non credit card option and fill the all details. Make sure your password has at least one upper case letter.\n", "Q: What happens when I reset the call statistics on an iPhone? I have an iPhone 4. Under Settings > General > Usage, there is a button to \"Reset Statistics\". After reading the manual, I'm not clear on one point: if I reset the statistics, will the entry under \"Call Time: Lifetime\" also be reset?\n\nA: After a quick test, everything but \"Call Time: Lifetime\" and the statistics under \"Time since last full charge\" was reset.\nIt only makes sense that the field \"Call Time: Lifetime\" doesn't get reset since it shows the the total physical time the phone was being used to call.  If it was restored and set up as a new phone I believe that the setting will then be reset since it will be technically a new life for the phone.  Unless AT&T/Verizon keeps track of that data through your number.  Then you would change your number to reset that field.  Though I wouldn't be trying that anytime soon.\n\nA: I would not recommend reseting your statistics on a iPhone 4S for mine knocked out everything on my phone and I ha to go to AT&T to get it reset again to get my phone back. Everything was deleted. \n\nA: It clears all of your revived and sent data for calls and it will not hurt your apps\n", "Q: What is the universal Document format on the Macintosh? (format you can be sure any Mac can display)? I'm preparing a document for Macintosh users.\nCurrently the document is in .doc format.\nWill all Mac OSX users be able to view that format?\nIf not, is there a better universal format to use? (.RTF, .PDF, etc.)\n\nA: Any RTF or PDF will be viewable by all Mac users. Mac users without Word installed can still use \"QuickLook\" to view a .doc file but it is less convenient.\n\nA: How about plain text? Does this document really need all that formatting?\nAnd putting aside the Mac issue, why would you use .doc for something that .rtf could do just as well?\n\nA: The very purpose of PDF is to present documents in a format ALL systems (Mac, Windows, Linux etc.) will display correctly, in such a way that the viewer cannot edit (useful for legal docs for example).\n\nA: Text files with Markdown formatting? Should be forward and backward compatible in perpetuity...\n\nA: PDFs will open in Preview for viewing - no Adobe Reader required. RTF will open in TextEdit, and can be edited, also with no optional software required. Which one is better depends on whether you want the user to be able to edit the document, or just read it.\n\nA: Another alternative is HTML which I would prefer over pdf if the information is mainly text as the viewer can alter font and window sizes to suit themselves. It is also read only like pdf\n\nA: Yes.  Textedit can read .DOC files.\nIf the formatting is particularly important, as always, you may want to use .PDF instead.  Any Mac of reasonably recent vintage can read either of those formats out of the box.\n\nA: The only truly \"universal\" format is text. As in a plain .txt file.\nAny Mac can open .txt, .rtf, .doc,. pdf. No extra software involved. Which is one step ahead of Windows which cannot open a .pdf without additional software, such as Adobe Reader or FoxIt.\nFor readability go with .pdf, otherwise if you can certainly stick with .txt, especially if it needs to be modified, copied, etc by the reader.\n", "Q: IPhone App or OS function to stop all apps I am looking for a good way to stop all apps in the background without manually stopping each of them individually. Something straight from the OS would be preferred, but I would not mind using a management app either.Some apps are taking a lot of battery and I would like to kill them with as few as possible steps in the evening.\n\nA: Since you mentioned GPS apps specifically, you can turn off Core Location (\"Location Services\") in the settings app.\nEach app runs in it's own sandbox and is totally oblivious to other apps. There's no way with public APIs to know of other apps, so a \"task killer\" such as you might have on Android isn't possible on iOS.\nGenerally, a well-written app will not use excessive background resources. If you can find out which app is sucking resources, I'd recommend sending a support ticket into the developer and let them know what's going on. From my own personal experience as a developer, I'd love to know what I'm doing that makes my users upset, so this is win for both you and h(im|er).\nThe bottom line, though, is that you're stuck manually killing them. :(\n\nA: Restart your iphone. What I do every night is turn brightness down, and turn airplane mode on. If it's charged, it will last overnight with an app like Sleep Cycle open. I don't feel the need to close anything.\nApps have no knowledge of each other, and there's nothing like this in Settings. I haven't heard of a jailbreak app able to do this, but I'm not a jailbreaker so I wouldn't know for sure.\n\nA: While I still hope for a better solution, I'm using SBSettings after jailbreaking. I can see available memory and press \"Process -> Free Up Memory\" when needed as well as see the apps that are actually taking up memory.\n", "Q: Reset your PATH variable I stuffed up (basically wiped) my PATH variable.\nIs there any way to reset it to the default?\nI look at How do I reset the $PATH variable on Mac OS X?, but I find it very confusing.  As far as I know I stuffed up my ~/.profile file.\n\nA: I have the following in my ~/.profile:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\nPATH=$PATH:~/bin\n\nThe first PATH declaration overrides any existing PATH setting (it doesn't include $PATH). The path used is the OS X default.\nThe second line appends ~/bin to the PATH and it is a personal preference, not a default.\nAfter edit, restart your session — or use command source ~/.profile to activate the changes immediately.\n\nA: The file can have the name .bash_profile or .profile - one solution could be to rename the file e.g. mv ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_prolile.old and then restart your machine and see if it helped.\nYou can also try to edit the file, and then maybe you'll see the wrong PATH, which you then can edit.\n\nA: In the case of logging in as a normal user and invoking su - root, I found that Mac OS X 10.8.5's bash was ignoring .profile and .bash_profile; I was unable to change root's $PATH by editing those files.  What did work was editing /etc/paths. After exiting the root shell and entering again with su - root, the new path was present.\n\nA: Resetting your terminal will work. It will reset your basic configurations.\nReset your terminal. From top navigation go to Shell >> Reset.\n\n", "Q: Are iPads locale independent? I am thinking about buying an iPad. I live in Germany. \nFrom a past job, I have a gift card with Amazon USA.

Just search for \"europe adapter for iPad charger\".\n\nA: Pekka, it might also help you to know that the iPad hardware and software installation are the same, everywhere.  The iPad you buy from Amazon will be identical to one that you would buy in Germany (or wherever).  You can fully localize the iPad by selecting your preferred language, as a Preference setting.  All Apple supplied software is localized to every supported language. \n\nA: iPad with 3G uses micro-SIM card format, which is not available on all mobile operators in the world. That could influence your ability to use iPad 3G connection in some places.\nYou can manually cut regular SIM card to micro-SIM card, but it's a bit hacky.\nAlso, bear in mind that iPad 2 3G sold in the USA comes in two versions - for AT&T and Verizon. The latter is working only on CDMA mobile network, which is less widespread around the world. Version for AT&T is working on GSM networks which is much more widespread.\n", "Q: How can I capture a screenshot of an entire webpage in iPhone's Safari browser? How to capture screenshot of entire webpage in iPhone's Safari browser like I can take in my Desktop with Help of Firefox Addon called Fireshot? \n\n\nA: After searching a lot on this thing finally I got the solution.\nWebsite Screenshot worked perfectly for me.\n\nA: Nuc's answer would give you a screen shot that renders accurately but would not show the Safari chrome but with very little work.\nAnother more difficult option would be to take multiple screenshots by pressing wake+home, scrolling in between so that there is a small overlap between shots.  You could then offload them onto a PC/Mac and then composite them together.  The benefit is you would get the full Safari UI showing.\n\nA: I use PixiWeb to capture website screenshots in its entirety or only visible area. \nIt also allows saving screenshots as PDF. Sharing options are quite impressive too (most social media sites).\n\nA: Although not free, you may get websnaps using Cinder (ex.

I set it up with the system settings for VPN and it works fine. Unfortunately, the VPN tunnel is used for all connections. Some ports (like the one I use for IMAP) are not open in the remote network.\nCan I use VPN for some applications (like Firefox and Terminal) and my regular connection for others? Is there a third party app to fine tune the VPN settings?\nCheers\n\nA: In general, the network settings are global, and apply to the whole machine, including all applications.\nVPNs will work great to access machines on a known network (eg: 192.168.1.x = home, \n10.1.1.x = work via VPN)\nWhat kind of VPN is it? It's possible that the VPN has grabbed the default route, meaning that all network traffic that isn't on your local network will go via the VPN.\nYou can run netstat -nr in Terminal to see your routing table.\nYou can use sudo route change default 10.1.1.1 to change the default route to your local network's router (eg 10.1.1.1 for me) so that it will route external connections. Connections to your VPN network should still go through the VPN.\nHopefully this helps!\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Mac os x in virtual machine on a macbook pro? I'm going to try diffrent versions of MacOSX on my macbook pro. I have a Snow Leopard installed there, and need something else (possibly a Tiger) as second solution, to test the software. \nSo I thought of a virtual machine that would be running on my Snow Leo and have a Tiger running on it. \nI tried VirtualBox, and install a MacOsX from there (from a .iso disk image), but it basically hangs during the very beginning of the instalation. \nIs there any good and easy to perform solution to do this? \n\nA: The only version of Mac OS X that can be legally virtualised is Mac OS X Server:\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#intro-macosxguests\n\nA: It is however possible to install a client version of OS X in e.g. VMware Fusion - but not out of the box.\nFirst you need to re-pack the installation DVD with a small correction (addition of one empty system file), telling Fusion that it is a server edition you are installing - and after the installation you need to do the same change in the installed OS X - then you are up and running.\n", "Q: iPad case for toddlers that hides the home button? My 18 month old son loves to interact with my iPad.  I have explored some apps that I would think he would enjoy, but he finds it hard to resist the device's home button.  (Perhaps because this is the most obvious way to interact with the device that always yields some kind of visible result.)  He hits the home button almost compulsively.\nAre there any solutions to this problem?\nIdeally, it would be nice to buy some kind of a slip-case for kids that was specifically designed to hide the home button.  I have seen some child-proof cases on the market, but they all appear to be geared towards protecting the device from the destructive forces of the child, or for making the device easy for the child to grip.  \nNone of them appear to offer a solution to the home button, and this is unfortunate because I can imagine him interacting with something educational without that distraction.\nIs there an off-the-shelf case out there that I have overlooked?\nIf not, does anybody have any thoughts about any other off-the-shelf cases that could be modified/hacked into hiding the home button?\n\nA: Can you put the iPad in the case upside-down?\nI don't mean with the screen facing in the other direction, but with the device rotated 180 degrees. on the plane of the screen.\nThis should make the home button inaccessible, though it may also obscure the volume, rotation lock, and power buttons (which may be desirable as well).\n\nA: While I didn't find a case that solves this, I did see some stiff adhesive covers called \"BubCaps\" designed for exactly this problem.   They claim that the material is too stiff for a toddler to activate, but just pliable enough that an adult can activate the button with some force.\nI'm tempted to pair the BubCaps with a very grippable silicone case.\nEdit:  What the heck...I've ordered myself some BubCaps and a case to try out.  I plan to leave the bounty open for other ideas in the meantime, though.  \n\nA: We've made a case that serves this purpose at AddyCase:\n\nLet us know what you think!\n\nA: Apple finally announced this as a feature in iOS 6, you can disable the hardware buttons and even parts of the screen!\n\n\"We were surprised at how many kids with autism have been using the phones, but there are controls in apps that you don't want them hitting.\" You can now select parts of apps to disable.\n\nPlease note that iOS will not work on the iPad 1, but only on iPad 2 3 and beyond.\n\n\nA: Honestly, I'd leave the home button as it is. We started our son on his iPad at 18 months. At first he was all over the home button, but eventually he figured out that the real fun was in playing the puzzles, games and videos. Now at 2.5 years old he's become quite proficient! :)\n\nA: Here is the iPad case you are looking for. It has a retractable home button cover to protect your apps and settings while your child plays with your iPad. It's available for pre-order here on kickstarter: http://kck.st/pxcAli\n\nA: I've read many requests for such a thing but have yet to see one. The suggestion I hear most is to use a binder clip to cover it, but frankly I'd be concerned about (a) damaging my child because binder clips tend to have fairly sharp edges, and (b) damaging my iPad because they exert a lot of pressure.\nMy suggestion is to choose a case that either provides a hole for the home button, like this or this, or that covers the home button with a soft material, like this. Then cut out a piece of chipboard (like the cardboard backing of a paper notepad) and slip it under the case and over the home button. If toddler fingers are likely to try to pry it out, a bit of double-stick tape (with the tape facing the case, not your iPad's specially-coated screen) should hold it in place well enough. \nAn adult could still pull the case off far enough to press the button when needed but toddler would likely be sufficiently distracted by what's on the screen to leave it alone after a few tries.\n\nA: There's an answer for iPhone that suggests a jailbreak app \"IncarcerApp\" which disables the home button. You can toggle this by pressing the volume buttons.\n\"locked\" iPhone video playback mode for children?\n\nA: Inclusive TLC's iAdapter 2\nHere is a link to InclusiveTLC a company that makes products for children with Special needs... so while this is what you are looking for (covers the home button and is for the original ipad)... its really expensive (198$).\n\n\nA: Fisher price has a new iPad case, see on Amazon\n\n\nA: Check out Squidoo.com's list of childrens's iPad covers.  The site compares many different children's iPad cases, along with a photo of each one. Some are good for accident-prone adults too, like the military grade one which covers up vulnerable ports and the home button.\n\nA: Go to settings, general, accessibility,  turn guided access on,  open app for child, press home button three times,  then press start,  to end press home button three times and choose end to go back to normal operation.\n", "Q: What happens if I format my iPod Touch 2G? Because when you connect it to Ubuntu, it sees iPod touch as a usb device and I think it allows to format it also. So, I wonder what would happen if I format my iPod Touch?\n\nA: iOS doesn't expose a \"real\" filesystem over USB. On my work Windows PC (without iTunes installed), one can see only the photos, and Windows recognizes it as a camera. (Also, it won't let you format it.)\nSo, since it's a fake filesystem, it probably won't accept the formatting commands.\nIf you try it, please tell us what happened!\n", "Q: Never create a .DS_Store file again I'm tired of finder creating these .DS_Store metadata and finder view tracking files in all of my directories. How can I disable this in Finder?\n\nA: Your question is kind of like asking \"git init\" not to create the \".git\" directory in your project.   In other words, you're choosing to use a tool, but you want that tool to not store the metadata that it needs to store.\nThere is an Apple support document that describes how to disable the creation of .DS_Store files, but it is only relevant to how the finder treats remote file systems.  It will not help you if you seek to have the Finder treat your local filesystem in this manner.\n\nA: In this case, TotalFinder does allow you to disable (well, it really redirects all .ds_store files into /usr/local/.dscache) the creation of .ds_store files, through what they call the \"Asepsis Feature\"\n\nA: As Fake Name pointed out, Total Finder comes with a kernel extension to redirect .DS_Store files which effectively prevents those pesky files from being created in your directories and without losing the function. What he/she didn't point out is that the kernel extension can be downloaded without Total Finder from github. You have to build it and drop it in your /System/Library/Extensions directory. Then you should restart your computer. It appears to be working for me so far.\nUpdate: This is now a separate project from TotalFinder called Asepsis. There is now a lot more documentation on how it works and the installation process. The GitHub repo is now located here.\n\nA: If you turn the ability to see invisible files off, you won't see them.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu on my iPod Touch 2G? I just wander whether it is possible to install Ubuntu in my iPod Touch 2G just for fun.\n\nA: It's possible, but very impractical for several reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is built for Intel x86/x64 officially, and unofficially for the PowerPC (old Macs and the PS3). iPod/iPhone/iPad is built off the ARM architecture, meaning you'd need to do a full rebuild of every single package.\n\n*You'd have to exploit the phone to load Ubuntu on to it, and use an exploited bootloader to load anything but a signed iOS.\n\n*You'd have to write custom drivers for everything you expected to work, such as the webcam, virtual keyboard, etc.\nI'd look into the progress of Android on iPhone. Last I know, Froyo was running alright on an iPhone 3G. Since the full chain of trust has been compromised on all devices except the Verizon iPhone and the iPad 2, it's possible, but the Android port is suffering all the issues I listed above.\nEdit: Ubuntu will also expect much more RAM and a much faster processor than the older iDevices have, but the newer devices are more up to par.\n\nA: I do not believe anyone has put together a way to do that. Even jailbreaking uses the iOS. Moreover, what do you expect to do on a 320x240 screen with no keyboard?\n", "Q: Finder Replacements? Since it appears to be impossible to disable the creation of .DS_Store files in Finder I'd like to know of alternatives to Finder.\nIdeally this would be a Community Wiki with one piece of software per answer and a description of the software with instructions for installing would be great.\n\nA: Possible duplication:  Are there any free alternatives to the finder.  (Note that one non-free alternative is discussed as well.)\nI don't know if any of the alternatives mentioned there help you evade the metadata issue.\n\nA: Checkout TotalFinder. It is amazing.\n\nA: Finder is much more than just the window you use to browse your files: its your desktop, and a key part of the OS. Youll keep getting the metadata files... just go ahead and hide them! Even if you use an alternative to finder, if you select to view hidden files they will be there. Just type this into Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\n\nor use an app like Houdini to hide/show them.\nKevin\n\nA: Two more big names are Path Finder and Fork Lift.  Neither are free, but both provide two panel browsing and a whole whack of other features that I'm not going to list here.  A free alternative, although susbstantially less powerful is XFolders.\nI have no idea whether any will address your concern about .DS_Store files but all have trial versions, so you can quickly see if any do.\n\nA: Go for quicksilver @ http://www.blacktree.com/.\nThis might be what you want.\n\nA: I'm unsure what your problem with the creation of hidden, useful .DS_store files are. They store the preferences for the icon size, spacing, background, etc. of the current folder.\nIf your problem is using finder to open networked drives shared with windows pc's that can see .DS_store files (and you find them an annoyance) finder has a hidden option to not create .DS_store files on network directories.\nCheck out this: Mac OS X Hints - Prevent .DS_Store file creation on network volumes \n", "Q: Why I can’t use zoom+ or zoom- in firefox4 in mac‘s Multi-Touch Touchpad? I can use zoom function in firefox3 and safari,but when I update to firefox4,I find I can’t use the zoom function ,how can I fix this problem?\n\nA: See this.\n", "Q: How should I submit bug reports and feature requests? Inspired by Marco Ceppi's DS_store question I became curious about what is the current preferred mechanism for submitting bug reports and feature requests to Apple. I'm aware that they have the internal RDAR bug tracking system, and that there is an Open RDAR project to crowdsource the tracking of issues, but I'm at a loss as to the preferred channel to submit something.  \nIs there a public-facing portal for submitting issues?\n\nA: Apple offers a feedback site where both bug reports and feature requests can be submitted by anyone. Be sure to describe the issue or feature as clearly and concisely as possible. \nDevelopers should use Apple Bug Reporter. If you carefully describe the issue including step by step instructions for reproducing the problem, they tend to get attention and fixed. You'll need an ADC (Apple Developer Connection) login to use the bug reporting system. Be sure to upload the System Profiler report, as well as any crash logs which may be relevant.\n", "Q: How can I set up Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac to work with the Portuguese keyboard layout? Can you help me to configure the Apple keyboard in Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac so it works correctly with the Portuguese keyboard layout when connecting to a Windows 7 computer? I want to configure it to work the same way that the Apple keyboard is configured when using Windows 7 through Boot Camp.\n\nA: All you need to do is to select the Portuguese keyboard layout in software on Mac OS X and also select the Portuguese keyboard layout on the Windows 7 computer to which you are connecting.\n\n\nYou can customize the keyboard behavior in the Preferences of Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure I fully understood your question.\nAn obvious answer is: Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac has a section Keyboard in its Preferences window. There you can configure the mapping for a few special keys such as the Windows \"start\" key.\nI personally use an Apple Bluetooth keyboard (the recent model, without numeric keypad) on a Mac with which I frequently connect to a Windows 7-based PC through Remote Desktop Connection. But I've never felt the need to change the application's default keyboard mapping preference settings.\nMy apologies if this doesn't answer your question. Perhaps you want to have more control over the keyboard mapping? But this isn't clear to me from your original question.\n", "Q: Can a hobbyist or individual apply for Apple's MFi program? I found that Apple has the MFi program to help develop a hardware for iPad/iPhone/iPod, but it looks like that only a company can apply for this program.\nCan a hobbyist or an individual apply for this program to develop home brew iPad/iPhone/iPod connected devices?\n\nA: Yes, smaller groups can apply to be in the MFi program, if they are serious about making a product for the iOS devices.  However, you will need to get approval from Apple for your basic device concept in order to get in the program, then the device will need to pass third-party certifications to verify that it won't interfere with the iOS device, etc.  Finally, Apple will need to approve your final product design before you can start selling it.\nThey've opened up this process significantly over the last year or so, but given the hurdles you have to jump to get a functional device out there this is still not intended for one-off hobby projects.  A small company can make a product to sell in lower volumes, but you'll need at least $20,000 in development funds to get through the process to your final design.\nRecouping that level of investment doesn't require selling millions of devices, but you do have to have some moderate volume of device sales to make it worth your initial development time and money.\nWe're in the process of building an MFi accessory, and we're a very small company.  Our target sales volumes are not large, but they're enough to make this worthwhile.  If the product takes off, so much the better.\n\nA: You certainly can, but you probably have to pay the same as if you were a big company planning on selling millions of products.\nA friend of mine tried to make a dock-connector-compatible sensor for a college project: Apple wanted to charge him the full corporate entry price to get the pinouts and size specs for the dock connector and the API headers so they could write an app that used it.\nHowever, this is definitely a case of \"it can't hurt to ask\". Maybe you'll get break if you can assure them you won't be selling it.\n\nA: You can't. I've tried this route and I got a call saying that you need to own (or work for) an electronics factory to be granted MFi membership. Software companies aren't eligible.\n\nA: Well, I just emailed them about joining. I'm a 'pure software' person, in that I may need low-level access to hardware, but it's existing hardware that someone else built.\nBasically, they told me no way - it's not for software only people.\n\nA: Yes you definitely can. All you have to do is make a one-person business.\n", "Q: What's a good \"todo\" widget for Mac OS X 10.6? I'm considering small widgets like QuickCal, Anxiety, DoBeDo, etc.  Integration with Mail/iCal would be great.  What's your favorite?\n\nA: Lately, I've became really passionate about Alarms.\nIt transforms your entire menu bar into a drop-area for whatever file, email, shortcut you want to handle later.\nPlus, it syncs with iCal, so you may use it in combination with another full-featured app (like TheHitList).\nJust watch the introductory video!\n\nA: I use Anxiety and its great, cause I really don't need much except remembering the name of the things I need to do. \nI've also tried iProcrastinate, and its quite good (but too complex for me, I needed something fast, simple and unobtrusive, Anxiety!), but it doesn't sync to iCal, which is a downside.\nThings I've heard is great! Although again, quite a bit like iProcrastinate: not a widget or simple ToDo, but a full featured app. \nSo to my liking, Anxiety for the desktop and DoBeDo for the Dashboard. You can have both really, and because they sync with iCal they will work great together. \nHope it helps!\nKevin\n\nA: I've heard great things about Things, but I haven't used it myself.\nIt's a bit more than a widget, but it does To-Dos. It's got iCal integration, and I think it does Mail too.\niPhone version available (with sync).\n\nA: MenuCalendarClock for iCal runs on the menu bar displays your iCal Todos and upcoming events. \n\nA: Things - Simply amazing and easy to use for To-Do's, projects, small notes to self. And full integration with Mac and iOS - A bit costly, but it does the job with perfection.\n", "Q: Add custom OS images to bochs on iphone? im trying to get DSL (Damn Small Linux) to work on the iphone version of bochs but i cant figure out how to configure the os.ini file, please help?\n\nA: Use ifile, click \"os.ini\" then click \"text editor\". \nIt works for me!!!\n", "Q: MySQL service is grey under Server Admin We just made a fresh install of Mac OSX Server 10.6.7, but the MySQL service doesn't seem to work, which is strange as its a fresh install!\nI open Server Admin, and under Services, the MySQL service has a grey circle.

Is there a keyboard shortcut (or way to set one) that allows to easily switch between different email signatures in mail.app ?\n\nA: Sorry to dig up an old question, but I had the identical issue today and this was the first result for my google search for “mac mail signature shortcut”. While these answers weren’t what I was looking for, the 3rd google result was a MacWorld hint, which offered the perfect solution.\nHere’s the answer: you can assign keyboard shortcuts for your email signatures, “From:” account selection, and even SMTP account from System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Application Shortcuts. To set up your shortcut, click the + icon, select “Mail.app” from the Application drop down, enter the text of the signature (or other option) as it appears in the New Message window drop down, and give it a keyboard shortcut. Rob Griffiths, the author of the MacWorld hint, advises using ⌃ (control) in combination with your desired keys to avoid conflicts with existing Mail shortcuts, which seems smart.\nIn my case, I created a shortcut in Mail.app for the menu title “None” (the first option under signatures) and assigned it the shortcut ⌃X. It is now exceedingly easy for me to clear my default email signature when it doesn’t seem appropriate.\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the System Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts pane (it’s the last item): \nAnd here is what it looks like in Mail’s New Message window: \n\nA: In \"System Preferences\", go to \"Language & Text.\"  Under the \"Text\" button, you have \"Symbol & Text Substitution.\" You should be able to setup a substitution there.\nHaving said that, I use TextExpander, which is also a paid app ($35). I find it to be very worthwhile.  \n\nA: I use TypeIt4Me for all kind of text - also for my mail signatures. It is like in the AutoCorrect in Word where you type some characters, and they become replaced with the actual word/phrase - this one just work in all Applications.\nAnother one that do the same replace thing is Typinator - but I haven't tried that one my self.\nThey are both paid Apps.\n", "Q: iPad turned itself off and won't turn back on I was just reading a webpage on my iPad and the screen went black and then the Apple logo came up and then the spinning loading wheel and it just went black...\nNothing after that.\nThe screen is blank/black/off - can't tell which. Resetting does nothing. Plugging it into the charge does nothing. Plugging it into iTunes does nothing.\n\nA: Try holding the home and power button for 45 seconds or so... (be patient!)\nIf you are lucky like I was, then your iPad will \"come back to life\".\n\nA: That sounds like behavior consistent with a dead battery. How long did you leave it plugged in?\nI'd plug it in and leave it charging for 15+ minutes, then hold the home button and power button simultaneously for 10 seconds to do a hard reset. If that doesn't work, it's off to the Apple Store to get a new one.\n\nA: I have the best solution to this. Follow this 3 steps and you will enjoy back your iDevice.                                                          \n\n\n*\n\n*Put your iDevice on a DFU or Recovery Mode while connected to power on the wall. Visit Youtube to learn how to put your iDevice on Recovery Mode.       \n\n*After yours is on a DFU or Recovery Mode, simply allow your iDevice to charge overnight.\n\n*After several hours of your iDevice charging on a DUF or Recovery Mode, turn it on from DUF or Recovery Mode to its normal mood. This can be done by simply holding both the power button and the home button till you see the Apple logo. Then turn the device off for it to fully charge.                                   \n\n\nLesson: never use or allow your device to run on a red battery before charging.  Enjoy! Works 100%. \n", "Q: Are there any car chargers that will turn my iPod off when the car is turned off? My car has an auxiliary input, which I connect my iPod to with a stereo patch cable.  The problem is when I get out of my car I forget that the iPod is still playing and when I come back I'm not at the spot I left off.  Is there an iPod car charger/adapter that will turn my iPod off when my car is turned off?  It would be nice if it turned iPod back on when I started it up again, but that's not a must-have feature.\n\nA: You may want to look in the direction of Bluetooth audio.  I recently used a loaner 328i while my BMW was being worked on.  The car had BMW's iDrive setup with Nav and Bluetooth for phone and audio.\nAfter pairing my iPhone with the car, it worked just as you're asking (with the added perk of not requiring a cable).  On returning to the car, without removing the iPhone from my pocket, my music picked right up where it left off.  Nice.\nIt was hard to go back to the \"line-in\" cable from the headphone jack when my car repairs were finished.\n\nOn review, I realize you were asking about car chargers as opposed to a more significant car audio change.  I have a Monster FM adapter for iPod that provides the feature you are talking about.  It is an older model, not compatible for charging iPhone 4, but it works well with my iPod touch 4th generation.\nHere's a link to the current model on Amazon\nAn excerpt from one reviewer indicates:\n\nAs a final detail, I'll point out a feature that may be unique to the\n  iCarPlay. When you turn off the car, the device stops charging the\n  iPod. What I was delighted to discover is that when this happens, the\n  iCarPlay sends a signal to the iPod to pause itself. This is simply\n  good, smart, considerate design - it takes the onus off the user to\n  remember to pause the iPod to avoid having the iPod battery run down\n  for no reason.\n\n\nA: If you have either an iPhone or iPod touch you could jailbreak it and then install an application from Cydia called Activator. It's free and extremely useful. \nAfter installing it, go to Settings -> Activator -> Anywhere. \nScroll down to Power, and under that click \"Disconnected\". It'll bring you to a whole new list of items. Scroll until you get to \"iPod.\" On mine there are 4 options, \"iPod Controls\", \"Next Track\", \"Play/Pause,\" \"Previous Track.\"\nHit Play/Pause and you are set to go!\nThen if you want it to resume when you car starts back up, just set the same setting for \"Power\" \"Connected\".\nOnly thing is, the car jack cant be one that draws current even when the car is off. It has to be one that functions only when the car is running. \nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Easy way to install additional spell-check dictionaries for OS X? I am looking for an easy way to install spell-check dictionaries for languages that are not supported by default on OS X (one example Romanian).\nBy easy way, I mean a solution that does not require command line usage. While this is ok for me, for average OS X user this could be too complex.\n\nA: Mac OS X is compatible with the aff/dic open format dictionaries.\nAll you need to do is to get one dictionary, and place it inside ~/Library/Spelling (you may have to create the directory).\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the Romanian dictionary from OpenOffice (or search for another language)\n\n*Extract the file using The Unarchiver or rename the extension to .zip and extract it\n\n*Move the files with the .aff and .dic extensions (ro_RO.aff and ro_RO.dic for Romanian) to your ~/Library/Spelling folder.\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text > Spelling  and choose the language of your choice\n\n*...boom! you have system-wide spell checking :)\n\n\nA: Are you talking about in e.g. Word or Pages - or are you talking about in Browsers like Safari, FireFox etc. - or just a system wide configuration ??\nOne solution for a system wide configuration could be to install the cocoAspell dictionaries: http://kitblog.com/2010/10/get_romanian_spell-check_in_osx.html\n", "Q: Re-enabling virtual iPad keyboard with paired Bluetooth keyboard I have an Apple bluetooth keyboard (A1255) paired to my iPad. Pressing the keyboard's eject button lets me hide or display the virtual keyboard. It makes sense to hide it with the external keyboard attached.\nIs there a way to turn the virtual keyboard back on, while the BT keyboard is still paired, but without having physical access to the BT keyboard?\nThe reason I ask is because the keyboard can remain paired to the iPad throughout my whole house, so it's easy for the two to be physically separated by a few rooms or a floor but still paired.\n\nA: This solution just works on an Ipad. when the soft keyboard disappears just press and hold the down arrow on the bottom right of the screen and the soft keyboard will be back.\n\nA: The easiest answer without having access to the keyboard or Jailbreaking is to simply swipe up for control center (available starting with iOS 7 in September of 2013), then tap the Bluetooth icon to toggle bluetooth off. This will disconnect your keyboard, and will allow the software keyboard to return to the screen. \nWhen you are near your keyboard again, turning Bluetooth back on will quickly reconnect and return you to your prior state. \n\nA: I have found a solution that works great.  We use a CS4070 Symbol/Zebra scanner with the ipad.  The minus button on the scanner invokes the popup keyboard on the ipad while keeping the scanner connected.\n\nA: If a Bluetooth keyboard is paired and connected, the On Screen Keyboard hides unless called upon, which is only doable from the Bluetooth Keyboard.\nThe solution to your problem is to turn off the keyboard when you're leaving to another room, or turn off Bluetooth on the iPad. It's as simple, or as hard, as that. But there's really no better way.\n\nA: my case : i was connecting bluetooth barcode scanner.\nsolution: double clicking the scanner button brought back the virtual keyboard.\n\nA: Not a perfect answer, but if you have a jailbroken iPad with SBSettings installed you could get pretty close to a quick & easy solution. The only other option I know of is to go turn Bluetooth off in the Settings app, go back to your other app, and then turn Bluetooth back on when done.\nFor a jailbroken app, though, life is simpler:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-tap your status bar to activate SBSettings\n\n*Click \"Bluetooth\" to turn Bluetooth OFF\n\n*Hide the SBSettings window\n\n*Type away on your Virtual Keyboard (it should have popped up on its own, but not always. You might have to exit the text field and tap back into it.)\n\n*Repeat the above process (Double-tap status bar, click \"Bluetooth\") to re-enable Bluetooth.\n\n\nYour keyboard will remain paired, though unusable, of course, while Bluetooth is off. Once turned back on again, your keyboard should pair with the iPad again the next time you use it.\n(IIRC, you should only have to jailbreak and install SBSettings in Cydia. There are other toggles you can add to SBSettings, but Bluetooth should come pre-installed with SBSettings.)\n\nA: I couldn't find any Bluetooth keyboad that support what you are looking for, I found a barcode scanner from Arkscan can solve the issue for me, and not all barcode scanner on the market can solve this issue, need to be careful. I paired the BT keyboard and the Arkscan ES301 BT barcode scanner, and both must be on, it works like this:\n1. I can toggle/switch between the on-screen keyboard and BT keyboard by pressing double pressing the scan button.\n2. For newer version of iOS, it allows you to toggle between on-screen keyboard, and on-screen keyboard plus BT keyboard at the same time, which I really like this feature.\nNot sure if this is a good reason to get one of the scanners to accomplish your goal, but it's really helpful, this is the model I am referring to, http://www.arkscan.com/product/barcode-scanner/wireless-barcode-scanners/es301-mini-bluetooth-barcode-scanner\n\nA: Steps to bring up onscreen keyboard (tested on ipadOS 13)\n\n*\n\n*Tab on screen where you want to type.  Cursor should be blinking now.\n\n*A bottom line should come up now with Chevron arrow down at right corner.  Press and hold the button.\n\nNote: If the bottom line doesn't show or you just tab on the arrow without holding, the line will disappear, in which you may bring it back by pressing command+option+K (or try other similar combinations) on your physical keyboard. and then go to step 2.\n", "Q: Is there a way to display more metadata fields in the Finder list view?

There is potentially a lot of metadata associated with that file, and this may be a useful basis to sort by.\nIs there a way to make available more fields to sort by? Or do I need to resort to a Finder replacement? I realize that iTunes could do most, but not all, of what I want. (iTunes doesn't display some .mp3 metadata fields.)\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you're (sadly) limited to the fields in the view options windows (cmd+j).\n", "Q: Most programs don't use proxy To get internet in my school I have to use the schools http proxy server. So I configured my network preferences to use the proxy. But nearly no program seems to accept that configuration and use the proxy. In Firefox I can help myself with setting FF itself to a proxy connection. But what do I do with all my other programs? Why don't they use the proxy I already set up?\nI set the following proxy configuration:\nFTP, Web, Secure Web, Streaming, SOCKS, Gopher are all set to proxy.domain.td with port 8080 and Automatic is not set. The proxy doesn't need a user or password and I didn't set one.\nWhat did I forget to set up?\n\nA: Answer is right here:\n\nTo get internet in my school I have to use the schools http proxy server\n\nIf the proxy supports only HTTP, it does only support HTTP.\nI don't think you forgot anything.

Only the Linux  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard provides for /var/loc See Wikipaedia for some examples of the hierarchies used from there is FreeBsd\nAs for direct OSX references see NSDistributedLock which gives no directions or example of paths to be used and shlock which gives the BSD example in /tmp\n", "Q: Confirming rendering behavior of this jsFiddle tabs example on an iPad 2 I would be very grateful if someone with access to the new iPad2 could confirm whether the [Glossary] tab in the jsFiddle link here is truncated around the letter -G- or -H- or is being completely rendered, i.e. all the way to the letter -Y-.\nOn the original iPad the content is getting truncated.\n\nI was talking about the document that is rendered in the Glossary tab. The glossary is being truncated at the letter -H- (i.e. at the rubric for words beginning with the letter 'h').\nI had an opportunity to test this out at the Apple store recently, and the iPad2 renders the documents in the tabs correctly, i.e. without truncating their content (cutting them off at the bottom) just as the iPad1 used to be able to do. \nHowever, I cannot be absolutely certain from this one test that the problem is limited to iPad1, because as the cache content grows with use  maybe the problem would eventually arise on the iPad2 as well. I am just speculating about the cache being implicated-- just trying to think of reasons why it used to work on the iPad and then stopped working, though I hadn't changed a thing. The iPad I test with belongs to my wife and I believe she may have upgraded the O/S after my original tests when the pages were working correctly.\n\nA: I'm not sure which -H- you mean, but the tab seems to be rendering OK in landscape mode at least.\n\n\n\nA: On iOS 5 and the original iPad the truncation of the glossary has ceased. \n", "Q: Move Time Machine backup from local disk to Airport Extreme disk and share with others I recently picked up a Drobo for storage and light backup, and want to clear the 1TB Western Digital external drive I have off my desk. I would like to still use Time Machine, but possibly off a share from my Airport Extreme, so my wife can use it on her laptop too. \nThis disk currently has been running Time Machine locally for my iMac. If I move the disk to the extreme, and tell Time Machine to use it - will it just start off from where its at, or will it have to do an entire new full backup and start over again? \nAnd with that, can you have multiple machines backing up to the same disk shared through an Airport? Or should I partition it for the different machines using it?\n\nA: I have run TM backups both locally and across the network.  \nMoving backups: \nJust moving the disk won't work.  If you don't need to use the old backups, it's probably worth just biting the bullet and waiting for it to complete a new backup (if you connect an ethernet cable on a gigabit network it's faster (~90MB/s) than connecting the drive via USB (~30MB/s)).  \nIf you need to keep the old backups, you could try creating a sparsebundle with disk utility, mounting it, and then copying the backup files directly onto it.  This method would be slower than creating a new backup from scratch over gigabit though, so if you don't need the old backups, it doesn't buy you anything.\nMultiple machines:  \nYes, you can backup multiple machines to the same Time Machine disk\n\nA: According to various sources, this is not possible since how Time Machine works differently between local drives and network shared ones (one reference on Ars Technica). \n\nWhen you backup to a local hard drive, Time Machine just makes a bunch of folders for the backups. When you backup over a network, it creates a sparsebundle (for reasons that are extremely critical to allowing Time Machine to work reliably over a network), and stores those folders in that sparsebundle.\n\nSince I knew I didn't have much of anything to loose, I just reformatted the drive and started it again.\n", "Q: How can I get the mic sound feedback in my headphone? I bought a noise canceling headphone yesterday and it works perfectly. The only problem I have is that when I myself talk, I cannot hear my voice correctly. I'm wondered if it is possible to enable the microphone sound feedback in the audio output while the headphone is connected? I have a MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.6 installed.\n\nA: You can use GarageBand as well (see this answer) simply create a new project with voice and set monitor to on. You don't need to record to hear your voice.\n\n\nA: I use Audacity for recording new sounds, besides being free, it gives you the option for hardware or software Playthrough.\n\n\nA: LineIn from Rogue Amoeba lets you route any sound input to any output. Freeware.\nPS: It has been updated and now works without a delay in the audio play thru!.\n", "Q: Real tracking app for iPhone?

Or is there some other device, software, etc. that I can purchase? Something that is real and not just for entertainment purposes.\n\nA: Not on the App Store. Something like this is a likely violation of privacy laws as well. There's no way Apple would allow it.\n\nA: The only functionality that you'll find for a non-jailbroken iPhone is the Mobile Me Find My iPhone service.  For Jailbroken iPhones there's Navimote, Undercover Mobile, and quite a few others.\n", "Q: What are some great OS X Dropbox uses? There are a number of ways I use my Dropbox with OS X apps, or iOS devices.\nSome of them include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recipe tracking: I keep a 'recipes' folder inside Together's dropbox-synced-library, so from my Mac I can drag recipe web pages to the folder keeping them as PDF's, and view them on my iPad while I cook. It also works with text-recipes I've created inside Together.\n\n*iCal sync: I have The Hit List synced with iCal and keep its library to Dropbox, so iCal's library is being synced to all computers, along with all other apps relying on it (Alarms app)\n\n*PDF to iBooks: The easiest way to send a PDF to your iBooks..\n\n\nI can't wait to read about yours clever/unique/nifty ways you're using Dropbox on your Mac / iOS devices.\nRules\n\n\n*\n\n*One answer per post\n\n*Please search before answering. Duplicate answers will be deleted.\n\n*Please keep the answers relative to OSX/iOS. No general Dropbox uses!\n\n*It would be nice if you provide a bold title to your answer. That way it would be easier to parse/search them.\n\n\nA: Fast way to copy a photo taken on my iPhone to my MacBook Pro.\nSometimes I need to move a photo I have just taken with the phone to my laptop, and using Dropbox I can just upload it to a folder in my account, without the need to connect the phone to iTunes and import the image with iPhoto.\n\nA: Setting up new environment\nI keep copies of my dotfiles and scripts in there, so I can easily customise my command line environment on a new Mac. Very handy for freelancers who have to work in-office from time-to-time.\n\nA: Simple file transfer from my MBP to Windows computer\nOr if I know one of my family members need something that I got, I simply put it there, and open Dropbox on their computer to grab the file. Much better than mailing to yourself.\n[from Matias answer]\n\nA: Dropbox saves me from having to use Windows for Web development.\nFor me, Dropbox makes it possible to do Web development on my Mac.\nI use it to sync my work with a PC so that I can test on Internet Explorer. That way, I can switch to the PC, give Dropbox a sec to sync my work, and then open my files. That saves me having to FTP everything all the time.\n\nA: I was sent this link recently on how to host your Git repository in Dropbox. Most people here likely have shell accounts and/or VPNs, but the author describes this as a way to get at your repo while behind a corporate firewall.\n\nA: iTunes Watched Folders\nSimilarly, iTunes can automatically add content from a watched folder, which is useful for people with an Apple TV and media server that aren't near each other.\n\nA: Folder Actions\nYou could attach a folder action to a dropbox folder to run an Applescript on whatever you put in there. I'm contemplating setting one up to run ImgOptim on any images I add, then moving them to a destination folder. Other examples could be running a shell script to convert markdown to html for quick-and-dirty site updates.\n\nA: Synchronization\nI used to use it as a poor man's synchronization tool for Safari, symlinking the ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist to a Dropbox folder.  It basically works but it's not failsafe --you should run Safari on one computer only when you're confident that Safari is not running on the other.\nThis can be applied to almost any application... just use it with care.\n\nA: Syncing of vim settings and plugins\nI use it for my vim runtime folders, including my vimrc, so that all my machines have the same vim implementation. When I make vimrc changes, or add plugins, etc., they're automatically available on other machines. This is quite useful because I use a Windows PC at work, and a MacBook Air at home, and they automatically stay in sync.\n\nA: Calibre Library Sync\nI use it to store my Calibre Library.  That way I can add books from my laptop or my desktop and share those books if I want to. \n\nA: For me, the biggest downside of the 50/100GB accounts on Dropbox has been the requirement to have the content stored locally instead of remote-only (see MobileMe iDisk, etc.). So when DropDAV came about, it was huge. Basically, it allows Dropbox to be accessed via the WebDAV protocol. That allows me to do anything from accessing all the content via a FTP client like Transmit without having to download 50GB+ first, to saving content directly to Dropbox from my iPhone/iPad in apps that don't support the API (ie. Apple iWork suite).\n\nA: 1Password sync\nSyncing 1Password's stored keychain across my Macs. I use 1Password for managing passwords and, more importantly, auto-generating random passwords so that I never use the same password twice. Dropbox makes this much easier. \n1Password's secure keychain file lives on my Dropbox, and each time a password is added or updated it's automatically sync'd across all my computers.\n\nA: Manage Torrent Downloads\nI have my BitTorrent client (Transmission) set up to watch a shared Dropbox directory for incoming .torrent files, so I can start a new torrent download from anywhere I happen to be. (GoodReader for iOS has some great file management capabilities, including uploading to Dropbox.)\n\nA: Syncing of .profile, .bash_aliases, .fonts and such like\nI use a Mac at home and Linux at work, and quite often i am working from home.\nI have a ~/login_config/ folder with a couple of files that I either softlink or source during .profile or .bashrc.\nMy Mac .profile contains source ~/Dropbox/login_config/bash_aliases,\nmy Linux box has a softlink ~/.bash_aliases -> ~/Dropbox/login_config/bash_aliases\n(and .bashrc on Ubuntu usually sources .bash_aliases automatically)\nI use a lot of aliases for ssh destinations for the machines I administer in the cloud and I can switch between work and home with all the same shortcuts, and never have them go out of sync.\nThis approach can be extended to other shared resources, for example fonts and as a previous poster said, vim is another good one.\n\nA: Collaborative Text Editing\nWhen helping my girlfriend and/or a trusted friend, I simply give them my Dropbox detail, and we can edit the same document and save it, back and forth - Much like screen sharing, just with documents.\n\nA: For me, DropBox has let me use my iPad (along with iWork for the iPad) as a laptop replacement. With the addition of DropDav, Dropbox is essentially a grafted on file structure the user can interact with.\nDropDav lets you use your DropBox via WebDav, which means documents I create on the iPad, which I've found to be particularly good at periods of intense, focused writing, can be saved directly there and are waiting for me when I get home.\nConsidering I work on a laptop, a desktop, and my iPad, I find this to be a massively preferable solution to most other things I've tried.\n\nA: I created a service using Automator that executes a shell script to compress my current XCode project folder. Each time it executes the compressed file gets written over and then accessing dropbox online, I can use the versions feature create a timeline of saved changes.\nThis has advantages for my workflow - Instead of restoring individual files one at a time. I will just take my project back to a point in time when I knew everything was working properly. Dropbox will save every version for 30 days and gives me more granular control above time machine.\n\nA: Tunebox Organizes and Streams Your Dropbox Music Files to iOS:\nTunebox is an App that makes your Dropbox a viable place for cloud music storage. It's a simple music player, where you can search through your artists, albums, and songs, then play albums. You can also download and save MP3s for offline play. \nYou don't get a ton of options like you would with most alternative music players, but it does the job for simple music playback well, even when you're on 3G/4G.\nPlease note however it is however a paid-for application ($4.99 US iTunes Store).\n\nA: Sound Effects Library\nI use part of my Dropbox space for my (not very big) SFX library. It's great because I can send someone a link with a sound effect and they can access it on Dropbox.\n", "Q: How do I stop automatic Bluetooth streaming? When my iPhone connects to Sync in my Ford truck it automatically starts playing music on my iPhone. This kills the battery. Autoplay on the Sync system is off.\n\nA: Turn off bluetooth on the phone.\nUnpair the phone from the truck.\nWhen you pair your device, the truck is seen as a remote control in addition to all the other functions so if the truck wants to play, the phone is right to start playing. There is no switch to disable one remote some of the time in iOS or to edit the capabilities of a paired device.\nYou might need to go to the ford dealer and see if they have a firmware update for your truck :-) Seriously - they either need to disable or let you better control the situation where the \"remote\" asks the phone to play music.\n\nA: You should try quitting the iPod app.  In my experience, streaming starts because the app is running in the background but paused/stopped.  When sync occurs, the iPhone iPod app begins to play.  \nTo quit the app, press the home key twice and you'll see all the the apps currently running.  Then press the red minus button to exit the iPod app.  I recently read that shutting down apps like this prolongs the battery life but YMMV.\n", "Q: My iphone always restarts by itself My iPhone often restarts automatically. It happens when I charge for long time and sometimes, it happens when I'm talking on phone .\n\nA: The best thing to do is to first try a backup and restore as new as detailed in \n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4137 \n\nA lot of the time a device restarting multiple times can be caused by a software issue, and frankly getting all your data on the computer is always a  a good idea. \nThis will also make sure you are updated to the most recent version in case you are working with old software.\nIf it doesn't work it is probably time to get a new one or go for a repair.\n\nA: Since it's a 3G, it could be that your phone is just old and the battery has gone bad.  \nIf your device is jailbroken, that could also be causing the problem. \nI suggesting checking with Apple to diagnose the problem. Then, decide if its worth fixing yourself or upgrading/replacing your iPhone.\n\nA: Get an application like AppSwitch which can show you the Console logs. There are several on the App store and some might even be free. \nLook for the last messages just before it rebooted, they may give you a clue as to what is happening. Look for a pattern of behavior that precedes the reboot.\nIf they always mention the same App, then uninstall that App for a while.\nIf the messages mention hardware related matters then it you had better take it to the Apple store to get it fixed.\nAlso before spending a lot of time debugging, make sure that you are using the latest version of iOS. The problem you are encountering may have already been solved and support people are more likely to want to help if it is occurring with the latest version.\n", "Q: OpenAFS client configuration I can't find any detailed guide on how to setup a client OpenAFS on Mac OS X.\nI downloaded OpenAFS 1.5.78 from OpenAFS.org but I can't make it works.\nI read that a panel for the system preferences should be installed, but I don't see anything.\nMy goal is not configure a server but just to connect to a cell as a client.\nAny help would be very welcome.\n\nA: Did you download http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.5.78/macos-10.6/OpenAFS-1.5.78-Snowleopard.dmg ? \nUpon opening it I was presented with a window with a few options, one of which said \"Click icon to install\".\n\nI ran through this installer, entered my password, entered in a false cell name as I do not have a cell to connect to at the moment, and finished the install. \nI do now have a system preferences area called OpenAFS. \n\nIt has all of the options though upon first running it does tell me there is an error with a config file not existing, I assume because I would create it and save it. \n\nCould you post any error messages from the console when you install OpenAFS? Are you an administrative user? Any other information would be useful in troubleshooting this.\n", "Q: iPad 2 stopped syncing with my MacBook, how do I fix it? My iPad 2 has simply stopped syncing to iTunes. I can still sync my iPhone, but syncing iPad 2 has no effect at all. It creates a backup and then simply says that the sync is finished without doing any thing at all. \nI can still transfer files to different applications . For example, I can transfer some movies to CineXPlayer but cannot remove any app from the iPad 2 or even install any app on it through iTunes.\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?\n\nA: First reboot the iPad and then try syncing. If still unable to sync, make a backup (make sure your backup is current) and restore the device to it's factory setting and then restore from backup.\n\nA: Having suffered the same difficulty with my iPad2, I tried rebooting the iPad2 using the usual way with the slide to power off feature but at the same time I pushed the button at the bottom of the iPad2 that takes me back to my home screen or that if pushed twice will show the running apps.\nThe iPad2 rebooted (I had to push in the off/on button again during what appeared to be rebooting because the white Apple seemed to stay on).\nAfter that, I was able immediately to synch like before, although trying to access Pages documents is still not working (that is, what I see on the iPad2 in Pages is different from what I see on iTunes for Pages documents and I can't move them back and forth using DiskAid the way I used to, but document features including moving back and forth seem to work in other apps). \nIt may be that the two button reboot is what was needed.  I haven't yet tried the iTunes music synching, though.\n\nA: When your iPad is attached click on its name in the left column of iTunes, then click on the \"Apps\" tab near the top on the right. Make sure the \"Sync Apps\" checkbox at the top is checked. The same applies to anything else that doesn't seem to be syncing.\n\nA: When iTunes transfers them it performs some sort of optimisation (which I'm not sure is documented anywhere), over which you have no control over. There are various photo transfer apps in the store that use wifi which may retain the quality - as I haven't tried any of them I don't know how good they are. \nKnow more about how to transfer or sync iPad contents to Mac, which included the detailed tutorials of how to sync your iPad2 to Mac. \nHopefully this works for all of you like it just worked for me!\n\nA: Try restoring the iPad and then try syncing. Or delete the backups in the settings section, then try syncing.\n\nA: Have you checked the options you have set in your \"apps\" menu and such?\nTry a different cord, or, if all else fails, back up your library and reinstall iTunes.\nYou should also make sure you have the most current version of iTunes.\nRefer this tutorial for information on how to transfer and sync contents from iPad to Mac.\n", "Q: How to open a HTML file of my PC in iphone's browser? I make mobile optimized websites and I develop websites on my Windows 7 Desktop. Whenever I want to see any .html file on iphone to check compatibility I upload the file to an online FTP then I open the file from that url.\nBut the whole thing takes so long each time.\nI've got XAMPP installed but no wifi on my desktop - just on the router.\nIs there any way to open on iPhone's Safari browser a .html file located at my PC's Desktop?\n\nA: If you're willing to install ruby (already installed by default on OS X), you might want to check out Annyong. You can basically point it at any folder and tell it to serve it on an odd port.\nIf python is more your style (also installed by default on OS X), you can simply type python -m SimpleHTTPServer to serve the current directory on port 8080.\nOtherwise, I sometimes use Dropbox for quick transfer to my iOS stuff.\n\nA: XAMPP has long since been a staple of simple personal web hosting by Windows-using friends' of mine. Allow me to repeat this, I have NEVER used XAMPP myself, it only comes recommended by friends of mine.\nThis gist of this process is that you need a web server running on port 80 on your desktop machine. And you also need to know what it's internal IP addresses is.\nAssuming you use XAMPP, download it, get it installed and configured to run on port 80. Check to ensure Windows Firewall opened up port 80 for it. Next, drop your web files into XAMPP's web serving directory.\nThen, fire up your iPhone, and open Safari. Browse to your computer's IP address / index.html or the file's given filename. (Ex: 192.168.0.8/page.html)\n\nA: You can install Microsoft's Internet Information Server on Windows 7 and then ensure your HTML files land in IIS's root directory.  From there, it should be trivial to view them on your iPhone.\nOf course, there are other web server options such as Apache, but IIS is pretty much the standard in Microsoft-land and you'll probably find it easier to set up and troubleshoot, particularly given that your needs are minimal.\n\nA: WAMP is the \"easiest\" solution, if you don't have experience with running a local webserver. \nhttp://www.wampserver.com/en/\n\nA: Short answer is no. There is nothing special you can do on iPhone's Safari to access a file on your desktop - not even using the USB cable.\nThat's the on topic answer, to this website. That being said...\nYour best bet is connecting through wifi. Supposedly you could also use bluetooth or even USB, but for both you would sure need to jailbreak and I wouldn't bother even trying because I suppose any of them would be quite troublesome because most developers wouldn't bother doing something in those lines and because none of the two are meant to give direct access files remotely - just for copying over.\nIf you don't have a web server, grab any from other answers, such as XAMPP (my favorite), Annyong or even using Python, and make sure it's running on the desktop through your own desktop web browser pointing to url http://127.0.0.1 or simply localhost, which is a shortcut.\nThen make sure your iPhone is on the same network and point your Safari to your computer's IP. Doesn't matter your desktop doesn't have wifi. For instance, if they're connected to the same router, by default they'll have similar IPs and same mask which will allow them to see each other on that same Local Area Network.\n", "Q: Resetting a black menubar to white? When I run Hulu Desktop (and certain other programs), they turn the menubar dark (and turn on auto-hide), but they don't put it back to normal when they are done.\nIs there a way of resetting the menubar to white (and turning off auto-hide) without having to log out and log back in?\n\nA: In case anyone has this problem and doesn't have Nocture, you should be able to fix it by running the following Terminal command:\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nThis restarts the process responsible for drawing the menu bar. It should fix almost all menu bar-related problems.\n\nA: I've not tried this (haven't experienced the problem you mention), but I suspect if you open the System Preferences and choose Desktop & Screen Saver, checking and then unchecking Translucent menu bar will force it to redraw and fix itself.\n\nA: I too have Hulu Desktop but I never see the menubar turn dark before.  My Hulu Desktop version is 0.9.10 (which is currently the most up to date version).  I go with what @MatthewFrederick said above and turning off and on the Translucent Menu Bar option.\nAnother thing you can do is to see if another program isn't causing the menubar to go dark.  I looked through the Hulu Desktop settings and there wasn't any option for turning the menubar dark.  I know I have some third party apps that would make my Mac perform certain functions when I run other apps.\n\nA: To answer my own question...  \nThe cause of the black menubar turned out to be running 'nocturne'.  It's sufficiently useful that I'll keep using it, and switching to 'night' and back resets the menubar to white without having to log out (going back to the login window from the 'switch users' menu also resets it).\n\nA: I found that simply clicking on the notification centre in the top right hand corner, next to spotlight fixed it instantly without messing about. Hope this helps\n", "Q: Apple iPod earphone problem My iPod shuffle Is just 7 months old and the earphones has a problem. The output sound is very low. I just now got my friends earphones and checked, the sound was loud and clear. What could be the problem. How can I rectify it?\n\nA: Sounds like to me that your earphones have started to prematurely break down.  How does the cable look?  Is there bends or twists near the ends?  If there is then perhaps a wire is broken inside the cable.  Normally this would mean no sound rather than a decrease in volume.  Either way it seems that the earphones will need to be replaced completely.\nAre you using the apple in ear earphones?  If so then simply replace the steel mesh inside the earphones by simply unscrewing them.  If you lost your extras you can find them on Amazon through a third party source.\n\nA: This is a common problem with earphones. Unfortunately there is no way to fix them.\nIf your iPod is still under warranty (at 7 months, it is), and quite frequently even if it's not, if you take it back to an Apple Store and talk to an assistant they will simply give you a new pair for free.\n", "Q: SelfControl for iPad? I'm looking for something equivalent to SelfControl for the iPad. Is there anything like that?\n\nA: Are you referring to the self-discipline-enforcing mechanism like this one?   That is: something that notices that you are spending a lot of time doing various things that you don't want yourself to do (too much web browsing in general, or perhaps too much Facebook in particular, or too much email...?).\nIf that is the case, then it is difficult to imagine how something like that could be written using the official SDK that Apple provides, because you would need to modify Safari, or block IP addresses, prevent other apps from launching, or some such thing.  These are not things that the official SDK allows a software developer to do.\nPerhaps there is something in the world of jail-broken devices, but I can't speak to that point since I have never ventured into that territory.\n\nA: Weblock blocks ads, but can also block distracting web sites, like Twitter or FB. As far as I understand, it will also block access for apps. Unfortunately, there is no option enable access for some time, like in SelfControl.\n", "Q: How to 'scroll down' when there's nothing more to show? (cause I like the blank space) When I'm working in a text document, I like to start typing at the top of the window or in the middle. I hate when the carat/cursor gets all the way to the bottom and there's no blank space left underneath where my typing will appear. It's especially annoying when I'm adding to the document by drag&drop of outside text - much easier when your target is half a page/screen, not a 5mm line.\nSo is there any way to push the 'last line' up the screen and create blank space? eg. in TextEdit or Textmate or Coda or a similar app.\n\nA: There really isn't a neat way of doing this.  I normally hit Command + down arrow.  This will bring me to the end of the page, where I can then press enter a few times, or if using textmate, you can create a snippet to insert carriage returns for you.  With an application like textexpander you can program a keypress to add carriage returns for you.\n\nA: BBEdit by Bare Bones Software allows for extra space with with two settings: half-page or full-page. You mention TextMate specifically, but it doesn't allow for extra space by default, as others have mentioned.\n\nA: Emacs.app is the only editor I'm aware of that gives you extra space beyond the end of a text document.  You can scroll the last line of a document all the way to the top of the window.\n\nA: I tried Sublime Text 2 today, and it behaves exactly the way I want.\nIt's a great editor in general, too. One of the very best.\n", "Q: Stand alone audio spectrum analyzer I'm looking for a stand alone audio spectrum analyzer for OS X. The main requirement is that it can analyze the audio out (the current audio from any app) rather than microphone or line in.\nI'm a developer (although not a obj-c, c, c++ one) so if there are no apps that can do this a library could work too.\nthanks!\n\nA: You can use SoundFlower to redirect audio out from any application to any other application. This removes the need to find an application that can 'snoop' the audio stream of any other application. Instead, you just route audio out from App A to SoundFlower, and then audio from from App B from SoundFlower and the two are connected.\nWith SoundFlower installed you could route audio from an app in to Logic and use it's spectrum analyzer tool.\nIf Logic is too expensive for you, you can look at combining something like Audacity (free) with Voxengo's SPAN which is a free, FFT-type spectrum analysis VST.\nI'm most familiar with the plugin + DAW route because that's what I know. But for stand-alone spectrum analyzer offerings you can check out some of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*AudioXplorer - free, but no longer activily developed. Looks reasonably feature rich though and supports real-time analysis of streams.\n\n*SignalScope Pro - very feature rich, nice UI but this is paid software. You can get it from the App Store for $200.\n\n\nHit Squad has a list of plugins and standalones for signal analysis on the Mac. Those two stood out when I scanned through it for non-plugin options.\n", "Q: Do the FireWire ports on the early 2011 MacBook Pros use 4-pin or 9-pin connectors? I've ordered a MacBook Pro (early 2011, 13-inch, 2.3 ghz), to replace my aging and breaking-down iMac G5. I'll need to run a FireWire cable from an audio interface (also on order, that has a 6-pin connector) to the FW 800 port on the MBP. \nWhat size cable should I order? (i.e., 6-pin to 4-pin or 6-pin to 9-pin?) \n\nA: Any Mac that has Firewire 800, including the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has the 9-pin connector. You will need a 6-pin to 9-pin cable.\n", "Q: Strange keyboard shortcut icons in Mac OS 10.6.7 Running on Mac OS 10.6.7.  Don't know of any changes that could of happened to make the keyboard shortcuts different.  Tried Googling and found nothing helpful. Anyone know why this happens and how to fix it?\n\n\nA: Those look like the placeholder glyphs from the LastResort font. Check your fonts folders and their permissions. Is that the case in every menu all over the system, in every app?\n\nA: The why this happened will be hard to guess without some sleuthing and more info. The \"what happened\" is easier - the font that Finder needs didn't load or has become corrupt/missing.\nAssuming you haven't added any fonts recently or use special font software some general next steps would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a back up of the system or\ncritical files (in case the\nFileSystem or Hard Drive is corrupt\nor failing) \n\n*reboot in safe mode -\nshift key held down at\nboot to rebuild and check things in\ngeneral \n\n*reboot normally - then fire up Font Book and check\nyour fonts for problems\n\n\nA: One thing to try would've been to clear the font caches: atsutil databases -remove. (ATS = Apple Type Services.)\n", "Q: Time Machine fails to backup FileVault home directory on logout I am using FileVault to encrypt my home directory, and Time Machine for backups. This is a typical workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am logged on. I plug in the USB hard disk drive that I am using for my Time Machine backups. I let Time Machine to run a backup (of everything else besides by home directory).\n\n*I log out. First, FileVault does its clean-up work, and then Time Machine starts to back up my encrypted home directory.\nHowever, more often than not step 2 silently fails. Time Machine simply skips the backup. Everything looks fine, there are no error messages, and a casual user might not even notice anything unusual. It just looks as if Time Machine did its things quickly. But if you inspect the log file (or check what was actually copied to the backup disk), you will see that it simply skipped the part where it should have done the backup of the FileVault directory.\n\nIf everything works fine, the log files show something like this. Note that Time Machine actually runs two backups. I guess the first one is related to the FileVault home directory, while the second one is related to parts outside my home directory; the latter part was already up-to-date, so there are very few changes:\n23:27:49    diskimages-helper[5309] Reclaimed 0 bytes out of 259.9 GB possible.\n23:27:50    com.apple.backupd[5089] Starting standard backup\n23:27:50    com.apple.backupd[5089] Backing up to: /Volumes/xxx/Backups.backupdb\n23:27:53    com.apple.backupd[5089] No pre-backup thinning needed: 7.30 GB requested (including padding), 485.02 GB available\n23:27:53    com.apple.backupd[5089] Indexer unavailable (200)\n23:27:55    com.apple.backupd[5089] Indexer unavailable (200)\n23:28:18    fseventsd[36]           Events arrived for /Volumes/xxx after an unmount request!

Just forgot to copy approx. 6GB of changes in my encrypted home directory.\nIn this case simply doing logon + logout fixed the problem and Time Machine started to backup it properly (resulting in the first log file snippet).\n\nThe obvious things like verifying the disks (source & destination) with Disk Utility do not help. The same thing has occurred with different versions of Mac OS X 10.6.x; currently I am using 10.6.7. Trying different USB hard disk drives, different USB ports, etc. does not help. I don't have anything fancy in my setup (other than using FileVault); the computer is a MacBook Pro.\nIs this something unique that other people haven't seen, or is this a more common problem? Are there any solutions or workarounds? Of course using a different backup tool solves all these problems, but Time Machine would be convenient if it worked reliably...\n\nA: It's not an answer to your specific intermittent failure, but I do have a workaround that several clients have used. \nI make them another account that isn't file vault protected and rather than logging out and leaving the mac at the welcome screen, enter the empty user and walk away. (or kick off a backup and then walk away)\nIn practice I get better backups when a user is logged in.\nIf this needs to work for you, do file a bug with apple since it should work each time and every time without a workaround. When it fails, there should be detailed enough logging to fix issues if they arise even if normal logs are suppressed as a compromise to added security with FileVault enabled.\nAlso BackupLoupe is great for poking at backups to see what is actually changing after the fact rather than guessing from logs and byte counts stored in logs.\nI have had other people reconsider file vault and just use encrypted disk images for data that needs to be secured which minimizes many of the drawbacks of having the entire user folder inside file vault. I've done this myself since soon after file vault came out and I much prefer it compared to living with FileVault.\n\nA: The following workaround seems to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not select \"Back Up Now\" in the Time Machine menu.\n\n*Just wait until Time Machine starts a backup automatically.\n\n\nA: I've been battling with the EXACT same problem for months now and it seemed random. Then I realised the answer is really simple:\nPlug in your power cord and Time Machine will perform the backup upon logout (with the backup disk connected before logout of course). On battery power it won't. I wish Apple would document that clearly somewhere or warn you on logout (I'm on OS X 10.6.8).\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 search doesn't work anymore Whenever I use the search-field on Outlook 2011 I get \"No results\". \nAfter installation it worked for a while, but now it's just quit on me...\nAny tips to make it work again? Resetting some index, recalculate some tables or something equally obscure?\nThanks\n\nA: Outlook for Mac search uses Spotlight. Check Spotlight settings to make sure Outlook isn't excluded. If not, rebuild Spotlight index database. Lots of free utilities like ONYX for this or terminal command: sudo mdutil -E\n\nA: Turned out that the index file that Outlook uses had been removed from the Documents folder after some over-zealous house cleaning by me... \n", "Q: How to search Google from iPhone Spotlight When I go to search, it says, \"Search iPhone\" in the box.\nHow do I change that to search Google?\n\nA: Also consider the excellent Google Search app.\n\nA: If you type in the item you want to search for, an option will appear \"Search Web\".  Press this and it will do a Google Search for the item you entered.\nYou cannot change the text itself (but the above should suffice in terms of searching google for a search term).\nMatthew's answer above re the mail notifications is correct.\n", "Q: How do AirPort Express and wireless access point relate? I was reading a story about how some guy reverse engineered AirPort Express and can't get one thing: what's that AirPort Express in plain words?\nI understand that there's a device called \"wireless access point\" that connects to a wired network of the Internet provider (that might be Ethernet) and makes that wired network accessible to Wi-Fi or some other wireless protocol users.\nApple has a picture of a white box with a recognizable 110V plug and looks like it is AirPortExpress. What does that white box do exactly and how does it relate to a wireless access point?\n\nA: The article is about reverse engineering the AirPlay part of the Airport Express device. The AirPlay feature allows iTunes to stream songs (audio) to the unit and you can connect a set of speakers or an amplifier to it via the 3.5mm stereo jack.\nHowever the protocol (and the key) AirPlay uses is not documented, and if I want to implement the same feature on other hardware (for example make my linux gateway computer have the same functionality as an AirPlay device), I have to reverse engineer the protocol (the language both devices speak over the network) and re-implement it. \nThe interesting part is that AirPlay uses asymmetrical encryption to encrypt the audio stream, and the private key is located only on the device. By obtaining this key, the last part of the puzzle is found.\nAfter I wrote this, I have found an article, which describes it (probably better) than me.\n\nA: Airport Express is a wireless device that can either repeat a wireless signal to another wireless router, or simply hook into a normal modem/router via its built in ethernet port.  It allows connected wireless devices to then get onto the internet.  As such, it is a wireless access point.\nIn addition to this it also allows connected computers to print to a USB printer connected to the Airport Express USB port.\n", "Q: Trouble with Snow leopard VPN. Doesn't start at machine startup I use VPN client that comes inbuilt with Snow Leopard OS to connect to VPN on the macbook. Mac OS uses “racoon” process internally to make any vpn connections work. This process starts when the machine boots up and runs in the background even if vpn is disconnected. Racoon won’t run in the background anymore when the vpn is disconnected.\nAs a workaround, I have to start this manually each and every time and it works:\ncd /usr/sbin\nsudo ./racoon\n\nHow can I make it just like it used to work before?

Hiya, I need to present some options on e-detailing on the tablet format. I'm quite keen to use iPads (as they still carry the \"wow\" factor imo) but I'm not ruling out Android tablets if that solution ends up being the best.\nE-detailing is where sales reps take in a tailored, flashy, presentation to specific clients, walk them through it and hopefully leave with a contract in their pocket. It's a key part of the sales process and quite a lot rides on it, so the presentation needs to be absolutely top notch.\nSo far I think I've come up with 3 solutions to being able to deliver this via a tablet:\n1) Build an app\nThis would be best from the POV of being able to develop a really precise and slick presentation, but it would carry cost implications, and also one huge issue I forsee is that it'd have to go through the app store! I don't think I'd want my competitors downloading my app to have a look at my sales secrets... Is there some way of getting apps onto an iPad without having to go through the store? I know it's possible for Android.\n2) Build a mobile site/app\nCan still make things pretty slick, and the cost will come down, but I worry about sales reps being able to work this offline if their net connection drops. If they were without wifi or in a poor reception area this could be a disaster waiting to happen. Could it all be forced into the cache? Seems a messy solution...\n3) Use Keynote or some other presentation tool\nVery cheap, still quite slick but lacking in wow factor and some features? Can you embed video into presentations like this?\nDoes anyone have strong opinions on this or answers to the issues I've raised?\n\nA: 1) Yes, if you join the paid Apple developer program, you can install apps on your own devices without going through the app store. You won't need to release an app to be able to use it. (It's also possible to run self-signed apps on a jailbroken device without joining the program, but that's kind of a pain.)\n2) You can cache web applications locally, but there is some extra work involved in doing that. However, it's probably not as steep a learning curve as learning Objective-C. Here's a little information about developing these apps, from the excellent Dive Into HTML5. Local web apps won't be as fast as native apps, and you won't have access to hardware features, like the camera. You can't even upload photos from Safari (which local web apps always run under).\n3) Yes, you can add video to presentations in the iPad keynote app. If you go this route, you might also want to get an app that allows you to fill out and sign contracts on the device.

I use terminator running on X11 for my terminal program, and I'm using SSH: OpenSSH_5.8p1, OpenSSL 1.0.0d 8 Feb 2011\nMy problem is that when tunnelblick VPNs reconnect all my SSH sessions hang and I must close the terminal and re-open it. In Ubuntu what would happen is the sessions would automatically continue working again once the VPN connection was re-established.\nIs there any way to make it so these connections re-establish once the VPN is back up? Occasionally my VPN hiccups and its annoying to close all my windows. I'm aware I could use screen but it doesn't really solve the problem as easily as it was working under Ubuntu.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I think each VPN client will be picky about this in its own way.  Since the network is dropping from underneath the SSH connection, you will have three scenarios that could cause it to \"hang\", or just drop (that I can think of).\n\n*\n\n*Data is flowing back and forth, and the connection is gone.\n\n*You get a new IP address when reconnecting.\n\n*Timeout/Alive conditions trigger before you reconnect.\n\n2 Suggestions...\n\n*\n\n*Use screen (you said you don't want to do this, I know, but it really is the most robust solution.

Would appreciate any pointers.\n\nA: Not enough rep to comment \nAs another answer says, the path of ScreenSaverEngine.app changed in Mojave. Instead of chasing a moving path, you can target your shortcut to the bundle ID:\nopen -b com.apple.ScreenSaver.Engine\n\n\nA: I agree with Jason's answer - the only built in way to lock the screen (which sleeps the display but does not engage the screensaver animation) is the shiftcontrolmedia eject shortcut.\nA free solution would be to use RedSweater's product FastScripts to map your choice of keyboard shortcut to call one of the AppleScripts that are floating around the net to toggle the screen saver engine rather than just let the display sleep. I'd try making a simpler script just to open the engine at the hard coded path if you only wanted to engage the saver.\nI am a very happy user of LaunchBar which allows a quick keyboard only method to start the Screen Saver. It's not really a keyboard shortcut in the strictest sense (first you activate Launchbar with it's own shortcut - then key in sss or whatever you chose/taught lanchbar to use for the built in Start Screen Saver action.) Any other commercial \"launcher\" product should  work as well to activate the ScreenSaverEngine app that is hidden deep inside /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/......\n\nA: Drag the app ScreenSaverEngine.app (located in /System/Library/CoreServices/) into your dock bar, click it and it takes you into screensaver. Thats the latest location as of macOS Monterey 12.1.\nOn older Macs уоu may find it in: /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/.\n\nA: I don't believe there is a built-in, system wide Keyboard Shortcut. The quickest way to activating the screensaver via the keyboard is either via a \"Start Screensaver\" command using a launching applications such as Quicksilver, Alfred, or Launchbar.\nThe quickest way of starting the screensaver using your mouse is via Hot Corners. Open System Preferences, click \"Desktop & Screen Saver\", click over to the \"Screen Saver\" tab and click the \"Hot Corners\" button in the bottom left. There you can specify a corner to roll over in order to start the screensaver.\nIf you want to start the screensaver quickly, because you want an easy way to lock your computer, a possible answer is located in the high-view \"Mac OS X Hidden Features Tips & Tricks\" question that remains active.\nAnd specifically, this answer.\n\nshift + control + eject    send display only to sleep (great for locking your computer instantly)\n\n\nA: Use Automator. Simply open automator and drag in the \"start screen saver\" action, select \"no input\" under the \"services received\" menu, and hit file > save as \"Start Screen Saver\".\n\nThis will now appear under System preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > General, where you can assign it any hotkey you desire, just as you would any other system action.\n\nfrom http://osxdaily.com/2014/07/10/set-screen-saver-keyboard-shortcut-mac/\n\nA: Many moons later, I wanted the same thing and I found a solution. I use BetterTouchTool to manage all of my keyboard/mouse/trackpad shortcuts and configurations. So I created a keyboard shortcut that runs a terminal command when pressed. To launch the screen saver from the terminal, use this command:\nopen -a /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app\n\nNow you can launch the screen saver with any keyboard shortcut (I use F19).\n\nA: Though, I cannot comment to a specific answer...\nThe path where the ScreenSaverEngine app is located has changed on Mojave: /System/Library/CoreServices/ScreenSaverEngine.app\n\nA: If your Mac has Touch ID, you can click the physical Touch ID button down and it will start the screensaver.\n\nA: In addition to MaxPRafferty's answer, starting with macOS Monterey, you can create a hotkey that activates the screensaver using the new Shortcuts app.\nOpen the Shortcuts app and click the +, which is on the top right of the window, to create a new shortcut.\n\nSearch for the \"Start Screen Saver\" action and simply drag it to the left pane.\n\nNow in order to set a hotkey, move to the Shortcut Details tab and click the Add Keyboard Shortcut button, set the hotkey you wish (I use ⌃+⌘+S in contrast to ⌃+⌘+Q, which locks the screen), this will create a global hotkey.\n\nNow just give the shortcut a name and an icon (on the top left of the window) and you are done!\nSame as with MaxPRafferty's answer, you will find the hotkey under System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Shortcuts\n\n\nA: Here's a bit of a hack involving the Keychain Access utility that allows you to define a shortcut to lock the screen -- it's five years old and I haven't been able to verify if it still works, though.\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/49080/2006/01/lockscreen.html\n\nA: On some computers it is CTRL-SHIFT-POWERBUTTON.\n\nA: Someone else mentioned using BetterTouchTool to assign an shortcut to running a terminal command. I thought I would pitch in that as of my writing this answer, BTT has a native \"Start Screen Saver\" action which will do exactly what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Original iTunes Library Gone, How to ReBuild Library On New Drive? I have lost my original source itunes library music and files.  \nHowever, I do have backup copies of everything on an external disk, I copied the original files and organization structure of the old library to an external disk.  (we'll call this external disk 1)\nI need to rebuild my library in a hurry, on a new external disk! (external disk 2)\nMy question is, how do I do this, so my new library (on external disk 2) is exactly the same as the original?\nAny help you could provide me with would be sincerely appreciated!\nLooking forward to hearing your solution!\n\nA: The simplest way (fewest steps) is \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the iTunes folder from old (disk 1) to new (disk 2)\n\n*Start iTunes with the option key depressed and select the library from the new (disk 2)\n\n\nDo edit your post or comment back if there are additional factors to take into account or if this doesn't work for some reason.

This lets you start iTunes for iOS device syncs and such when the external is not connected. I wouldn't do both things the same week. Just get things working for now :-)\n\nA: What's the problem with copying the entire iTunes Library folder to the new disk, then using the Add to Library feature (File>Add to Library) and selecting the folder on the new disk?\nSurely this rebuilds a new Library based on the iTunes folder on disk 2?\n", "Q: Is Mac OS X 10.7 Lion developer preview 2 stable enough for day to day use?

Sorry!)\nI'm a iOS programming student using 10.7 and Xcode 4.1 on a daily basis, so I'd say yes. Some apps don't work too well and/or crash spectacularly on startup, but it's livable.\nI use a second hard drive for Lion, where my SuperDrive used to be.

As @vxjasonxv has shown - the iPad will answer pings when the display is on and the wifi connected with recent network activity.\nYou can use tcpdump on your mac to see traffic from the iPad and you could use the Network Utility to port scan the iPad's ip address to probe for open ports. It might also help if you can log into your router to see the iPad's assigned IP address if you don't want to watch for the arp requests using tcpdump.\n", "Q: Mac exhibiting inexplicable network disconnects? Lately, I've seen a few Mac computers that can a) see the wireless network, b) \"connect\" to the wireless network, and c) receive a valid IP address, yet when a web browser is launched it's stuck in an eternal loading loop, or when the ping utility is used, it returns with a connection timeout.\nI've solved these problems in the past by making a new network location, but recently that alone hasn't seemed to fix it immediately. I'll make a new location being sure to hit 'Apply', even going so far as to restart the computer, but none of these things seem to work as I expect them to. Internet connectivity will \"magically\" return a ways into troubleshooting, and I wish I had a more concrete explanation as to why. Could anyone elaborate on these situations?\n\nA: It sounds like you're having DNS issues. Most Cocoa apps make DNS calls that are handled via mDNSResponder nowadays, so if the mDNSResponder process is having a problem, even traditional unicast DNS lookups will fail.  Next time this happens, try...\nsudo killall -9 mDNSResponder\n\n...this is sure to kill mDNSResponder. Don't worry, launchd will automatically restart it.\nIt's possible that whatever was causing mDNSResponder to hang was cleared up by your troubleshooting steps, or maybe you triggered a network configuration change that cause mDNSResponder to reload itself.\nThere are still a few command-line tools that use traditional Unix DNS resolver libraries that don't leverage mDNSResponder. These include host, dig, and nslookup.  Another way to see if it's just mDNSResponder and not DNS in general is to use one of those three tools to do a DNS lookup the next time the problem happens.\nI also agree with another user's suggestion to ping a host by IP address. I would recommend that you do...\nping -n 8.8.8.8\n\n...the -n tells ping not to try to do a reverse DNS lookup on the host you're pinging. 8.8.8.8 is a nice memorable IP address for one of Google's publicly-accessible resolving DNS servers.\n\nA: The obvious first thing to check is the routing tables. Next is to check DNS.\nWould you fire up network utility and post the netstat info as well as check into traceroute and lookup for a few large sites that you know are generally working.\n", "Q: ImageMagick Errors while installing dependencies I'm using this script:\nhttps://github.com/maddox/magick-installer\nto install imagemagick and it's dependencies\ni have a few errors the first run for some missing files or borken links but now i have all this solved.... but when it's installing the libpng, i think, the scrip stops and trow this error:\nln: ./libtool: File exists\ni don't know what to do, seems like the first run it created some symlink somewhere and not it found this symlink and stops the script.\nthanks.\n\nA: Try installing ImageMagick with HomeBrew \nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\nOnce installed just type \nbrew install imagemagick\n\nThis will download any dependancies, compile the source and install it. \nMore info here : http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/homebrew-os-xs-missing-package-manager/\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Port + External Display + Other Devices I've recently been reading about new peripherals for the Mac (such as this). I'm very attached to using an external display, but since the DisplayPort is now combined with Thunderbolt, how is it expected that we use an external display and a device?\nAs I understand it, Thunderbolt supports daisy chaining up to 7 devices, but it would appear that the display/device doesn't support this. Are we going to start seeing ThunderBolt \"hubs\" anytime soon, or am I asking this question too early?\n\nA: Thunderbolt is different than other connectors in that there are two 10 Gbps signals multiplexed on one physical connector/cable assembly. The DisplayPort signal will go down the chain of devices uninterrupted so the full DP bandwidth will get to the monitor that will ultimately end up at the end of the device chain. Of course new display hardware could be released to add a hub / further Thunderbolt connections - but existing DP monitors should work as described.\nAll the rest of the devices will share in the PCIe bandwidth - sort of like how existing system boards have multiple PCI slots operating at full speed. Until vendors start shipping real devices with hubs and connectors - we are limited to speculation and browsing the engineering/marketing materials released by Intel and Apple.\nFrom what I've read, the initial devices will be like FireWire devices - two Thunderbolt ports per device - one to the computer and one for the next device to connect down the chain. The bi-directional, hot-pluggable, dual-channel cables with substantial bus power means the best aspects of FireWire could be commonplace as a much more powerful standard for years to come.\n\nA: As it is right now, you would daisy-chain 6 or 7 Thunderbolt devices and hook your display on the end of the chain. The mini-DisplayPort compatibility is available down the whole chain.\n(And yes, there will probably be Thunderbolt hubs, eventually. I propose we call them \"Thunderhubs\" to save on some typing.)\n\nA: I don't know enough about Thunderbolt to say if hubs are possible. If devices are given an ID for their location in the daisy chain line SCSI was, this is probably impossible. Imagine this: your computer is device zero, your external SSD RAID is device 1, your hub is device 2, and your monitors are both device 3. Your computer could get very confused.\nI think we'll see Thunderbolt devices come out designed to be daisy-chained. All the devices at the Intel keynote were daisy-chainable (correct me if I'm wrong) and I think that'll just be the Thunderbolt culture, like FireWire.\n", "Q: How to configure OSX to not to sort new files in a folder and how to prevent new Finder windows pop-upping when unzipped? I have to unzip a bunch of files in a bunch of different folders. So I select one file to unzip, then move onto the next file. But as I set a bunch of files to unzip, they start to complete and start popping up new windows!\nPretty soon my screen is covered with new windows popping up constantly and it becomes a pain to navigate, whether it's to select new files to unzip or do something else.\nSecondly, on Windows I've used to have my newly created zip-files to be in the end of the file list, ie. they appear as the last item in the Explorer when viewing the folder's contents.\nOn OS X, though, the zip-files get sorted automatically, which is not what I'd prefer.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to configure OS X to append new files in a folder to the end of the folder (regardless of how its sorted)?\n\n*How to configure new folders to not pop up when unzipping has finished?\n\n\nA: Archive Utility can be lightly configured. The easy way to do it is to open an archive file and as soon as you see a progress dialog, hit Command (⌘) + , in order to bring up the app preferences.\nOtherwise, you can manually open the Archive Utility alone by browsing to /System/Library/CoreServices and opening Archive Utility.app. Afterwards, you can use the Archive Utility menu to get to the preferences, or again use Command (⌘) + , to open the app's preferences up.\n\n\nA: Whilst not an answer to your first question/problem directly, one workaround would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all of the zips that you wish to open/unzip.\n\n*Press CMD + O to open all the zip files.\n\n*Wait for them all to complete and open the finder windows.\n\n*Press CMD + Option + W to close all Finder windows\n(Warning, this will close other windows not generated by the unzipping too)\n\nA: \nQuestion: how to configure OSX to append new files in a folder to the end of the folder (regardless of how its sorted), and how to configure new folders to not pop up when unzipped.\n\nVxJasonxV provided an answer for the latter part of the question, so here is the first part.\nMake sure you've only checked Arrange by… option rather than Keep arranged by… option (displayed when ⌥ Option / Alt is pressed) under the View menu.\nThe Keep arranged by option  is similar to automatic sorting in Windows and will automatically sort the contents of the folder.

Any ideas how to fix this permanently?\n\nA: Its possible you deleted some printer folders but left the actual kext files in place.  To delete the kext files that are causing an issue, open terminal and type\nsudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/Belcarra.USBLAN_netpart.kext\n\nThe system will ask for your password.\nRepeat this for any other files the system complains about.  You will then need to reboot.\nIf something stops working as a result of the above, you may need to re-install the drivers.  \n\nA: It looks like whoever it was at Logitech that created the Harmony 1000 Installer package for OS X had absolutely no clue how to do it properly.\nThe file permissions of the files that the installer package installs are completely botched. Some are set to a User ID and Group ID of 509 and 509, which doesn't even exist on my machine. (The initial OS X user has a UID of 501, and each additional user has the next higher UID. For example, 502, 503, etc. So, unless you have 8 total users, 509 won't even be defined on your system).\nThe file permissions of the .kext files it installs have a UID and GID of 510 and 510, respectively. OS X will refuse to load kexts unless they have the proper permissions. That means a user of root (UID of 0), and group of wheel (GID of 0).\n[EDIT] OK, it appears that Logitech is actually installing the files with botched permissions and then \"repairing\" the permissions (setting a user of root and group of wheel) in the package's postflight shell script. (Ugh, even their script is noobish: prefixing every command with sudo is unnecessary, since the scripts are run as root anyway). While I guess that may work, it's kind of a backwards way of going about it. (They should have just set the proper permissions on the files they included as the payload of the installer package). And, obviously in your case, the postflight script must have failed during the installation, and has left those kexts with botched permissions.\nYou should be able to fix the permissions on the kexts by running the following AppleScript:\nhttp://www.markdouma.com/developer/RepairLogitechHarmonyKexts.zip\nJust download it, and double-click on the AppleScript to open it in AppleScript Editor. Then click the green Run button, and enter your password when prompted.\nFor the record, the script just runs the following chmod command:\ndo shell script \"/usr/sbin/chown -R 0:0 \n   /System/Library/Extensions/Belcarra.USBLAN_netpart.kext \n   /System/Library/Extensions/Belcarra.USBLAN_usbpart.kext \n   /System/Library/Extensions/RemoteControl.USBLAN_usbpart.kext;\n   /usr/bin/touch /System/Library/Extensions\"\n with administrator privileges\n\nYou may need to restart before the kexts will be loaded properly.\nHope this helps… \n", "Q: How do I play a YouTube video in the background on my iPad? I like to 'listen' to YouTube video in the background while I am surfing on my desktop. However, I cannot do this on the iPad as, as soon as I switch from YouTube video to the browser, the video pauses. Is there a solution for this either in the form of an app or a website?\n\nA: Play the video on youtube. Hit home button to exit, lock the screen, hit home button again 2 times, the current playing track will be displayed at the top of screen with play button under it. tap that and voila. (works with iOS 5)\n\nA: Try the following steps :\n1: Start the video from YouTube whilst in Safari.\n2: Hit Home key once. You'll exit Safari and playback will stop.\n3: Double-tap Home key to bring up the app-switcher. Slide to the right to bring up background audio controls. The icon on the right side will show whichever program you last used with background audio: Safari.\n4: Press Play. Youtube audio will resume playback.\n\nA: It looks like google is hunting down and killing all apps with threats and API terms changes to make it impossible to write an app that does. Ore than safari can do for YouTube. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://jonasgessner.com/protube2-statement.html\nI am and was a satisfied user of protube and have deep respect for how the author tried to not take away features from past paid users of the app. \nI don’t use google's app either, but that might be the only solution for people going forward. \n\nA: *\n\n*Play a youtube video\n\n*Press home button -> video/audio stops\n\n*Press home button twice to bring the multi task bar\n\n*Swipe right to see the music controls\n\n*Click play button and enjoy the music... :)\n\n\nA: One simple solution that I use is to simply convert and download the video to an mp3. Then you can save it and play it back anytime. There is a great new tool that will let you convert and download YouTube videos right from your browser. This is free although you will need to create an account and login to use it. Learn more on my blog...\n", "Q: AppleTV: can I watch movies from third parties? Is there a way to watch Divx movies I usually watch with QuickTime or VLC player on my mac, on Apple TV ?\nIf I buy Apple TV I would like to watch movies I downloaded from third parties, and not only I bought through iTunes.\nDoes it work ?\nthanks\n\nA: As seen on Apple website, the supported video formats are:\n\n\n*\n\n*H.264 video up to 720p, 30 frames per second, Main Profile level 3.1 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps per channel, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats\n\n*MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats\n\n*Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) up to 35 Mbps, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in ulaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file format\nSo in order to play your DivX movies you have either to transcode them into a supported format using tools like Handbreak, or to jailbreak it so it will support more video formats.\nIn my humble opinion, Apple TV is the best device for streaming music, listening/watching podcasts, streaming your photo libraries from your mac to your TV, and if you are an iTunes store fanatic then buying/renting movies from the iTunes store.\nIf your main interest is watching divx/mkv's, then I would suggest you to look for something else.\n\nA: Not without hacking the AppleTV.  Out of the box you can only watch quicktime movies without divx.\n\nA: Another option you could try is AirFlick, which can stream unsupported formats from a Mac to an AppleTV. It requires VLC to be installed on the Mac to transcode on the fly, and it's certainly not perfect, but I've used it with varying degrees of success.\nIf you go the offline transcoding route (which is what I do), don't forget to check out the Elgato Turbo H.264 USB dongle, which can speed up this process considerably.\n\nA: You can jailbreak Apple tv, put XBMC mediacenter on Apple tv and use \"pelisalacarta\" add-on or, for the moove in English put \"icefilms\" add-ons for to access at icefilms movie library with your Apple Tv!\n", "Q: What can change the calendar in iPhone/iOS to start weeks on Mondays and not Sundays? My iPhone's calendar, configured by me to start week Sundays, suddenly started starting week Mondays. I cannot find the setting to configure this any more.

Clients can see all the files and folders that have been put on the network share, and the data gets transparently archived to tape in the background leaving a small 'stub' file on disk. When a read request on a file is issued by a client, the tape system recalls the file from tape and sends it back to the client. The upshot is I get a large amount of cheap high-latency storage, but with a very simple network share interface.\nHowever, there's a significant problem with Mac clients: when Finder sees a directory full of files, it attempts to generate thumbnails and read other data about the file. Finder assumes that it can get data relatively quickly, so when it sees a directory full of 100GB worth of mov files, it requests to read each one so that it can generate the thumbnails.\nPredictably, this sends the tape drive crazy, as it tries to pull down each of these files from tape just to generate the thumbnails.\nIdeally, I'd like to tell Finder to not read any data inside the file until it's explicitly asked for by the user, ie. they request to copy it to their local disk. Is this possible?\n\nA: I don't know if this will work in your particular case, but you might as well try it.\nOpen the Samba share and press Command+J, then uncheck \"Show icon preview\" and click on \"Use as defaults\". This way the Finder won't try to extract info from the file to generate a thumbnail, no matter if it is an image, or a mp3, or a movie. However this would be valid only for the root directory you just changed the settings to, so the local hard drive stuff should be ok.\n\nA: By pressing cmd+J then unchecking \"Show icon preview\", I've solved the flooding errors in my log that was :\ncom.apple.quicklook.satellite[16222]: Failed to initializeServer(), returned 5 \ncom.apple.quicklook.satellite[16222]: Failed to communicate with qtkitserver: Connection invalid\n\nif that can help too.\nI didn't understand that the setting is not the same for the Desktop, windows in column view… so I've been looking for a system-wide solution that actually was a checkbox.\nThen using TotalFinder and always in column view, you only have to check twice to apply this setting \"everywhere\", that's it.\n\nA: First of all, I am using http://cantuse.it/2008/11/disable-video-thumbnails-in-mac-os/ as a reference. \nNow originally I remember removing and modifying the quicklook generators to associate a blank filetype with the text generators, in this case, it looks like the video thunbnail generation is handled by the same process.\nMove /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/Generators/Movie.qlgenerator somewhere else, and it should not try to generate the thumbnails in the future. Good luck!\n\nA: You can disable the QuickLook process responsible for generating the thumbnails.\nOn Mac OS X 10.6, use the following command to disable the automatic launching of the quicklookd daemon process:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.quicklook.plist\n\nMac OS X may assume this process is always available, so always back up first and tread with care when disabling system wide services and daemons.\n", "Q: Where can I get information on the number of iOS devices sold and on iOS activations?

That sort of information tends to be confidential within companies. Apple occasionally talks about general numbers (they sold eleventy billion iPads in the first month) and you can attempt to extrapolate from there.\nThere are also third-party sources that have revealed their own related statistics, but those will be incomplete and possibly inaccurate.\n\nA: Horace Dedieu at asymco.com is one of the most accurate and perceptive analysts out there and has assembled a wealth of detail to examine.\n\nA: I agree with CajunLake, but some quick searches will reveal the numbers Apple has disclosed.  For example, see this.\n\nA: Have you tried checking around sites like the Wall Street Journal? I think they normally get that stuff.

My most common search pattern is to search for files based on their name. When I try this in Spotlight (cmd-space) it rarely works. Is there a way to make Spotlight search for file names, and to place those results on top?\n\nA: You can use this in your search to search for files with 'query' in their name: name:query\nFor more info about Spotlight commands, you can take a look at an excerpt of Mac OS X: The Missing Manual.\n\nA: Spotlight needs you to search using the name: selector to restrict the results.\n\nI've also become a big fan of the Found app. It's currently free on the app store and lightning fast (seems faster than LaunchBar to me - and that's saying a lot as it's a speed demon). It's real claim to fame is that it also indexes DropBox, Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs.\n\nBack to spotlight if you don't want another app no matter how robust, slim and fast.  Since the spotlight window defaults to showing everything - not just limited to searching the file name, I like to open the Finder search window and click on name. For me it's quicker than using the name:img trick since I get more hits than the spotlight window itself will show and end up hitting the show all results more often than not.\noption +command +space and then you can type the name you wish to find followed by a click on the File Name button will only show the results with that string in the file name.\n\n", "Q: App to transfer the files by shaking the iPhone?

I am used to doing this in Windows with FireFox or IE by pressing Ctrl+F5.\nIs there a way to do this for Safari on a Mac?\n\nA: Go to Safari > Empty Cache, or hit ⌘ Command+⌥ Option+E. To refresh, click the refresh button on the addressbar or press ⌘ Command+R.\nAnother tip. If you want to restore Safari, like completely clear all the caches, or parts of it, go to Safari > Reset Safari. I use it usually when I need to clear a lot of memory from Safari, for it will clear the webpage screenshots, the cookies, the favicons, etc. \n\nEdit: On the latest version of Empty Cache isn't on the Safari menu any more. It's now on the Develop menu. To show the Develop menu it, go to Safari > Preferences..., click the Advanced tab, and check Show Develop menu in menu bar. The keyboard shortcut remains unchanged, though.\nSafari > Reset Safari isn't an option any more. To clear history you can use History > Clear History... and to clear cookies/local storage data, go to Safari > Preferences..., click the Privacy tab, and either click Remove All Website Data... or Details... to view and remove it for individual sites.\n\nA: If you haven't already, enable developer tools: open settings (Cmd + ,), go to the advanced tab, and check the box that says \"Show Develop menu in menu bar.\"\nEmpty caches a single time: Develop > Empty Caches\nKeyboard shortcut to empty caches a single time: Opt + Cmd + E\nIf you want to disable caching (for example, if you are developing a website and need to consistently reload changes to files on your site) you can do so: Develop > Disable Caches.

After I fill out the form, I want to print it to PDF so that it is finalized.\nUnfortunately, Adobe disables the Mac print to PDF and tells me I have to save as PDF instead, but if I save as PDF then other people can still edit it.  My current annoying solution is to print it to paper and then scan it.\nAnyone know a way to circumvent Adobe's disabling of the Mac print to PDF feature?\n\nA: Adobe Reader 10.x does go out of it's way to hide the normal print options from OS X but you can still get to them by clicking on the Printer... button at the bottom of the Adobe Print Dialog and clicking through the warning not to change things behind Adobe's back.\nI don't have a form like you mentioned in red, but try setting all the print options in Adobe to make your form appear as desired (with or without stamps, annotations, sticky notes and summaries, etc...) and then get to the Apple print dialog to attempt a print to PDF.\nIf Adobe isn't preparing the file for print until after you hit print in the Adobe dialog - then your only recourse is faking it out by defining a new virtual printer. That way adobe is forced to send the data to the mac which will then pop it into a plainer PDF file for you with just the data filled out.\nI've not resorted to this, but CUPS-PDF and this tip on making it work with Snow Leopard's sandboxing security looks to be promising. I hope you don't have to resort to that hacky of a solution to save paper waste and time.\n\nA: I ended up using PDF Writer. It works perfectly by emulating a printer.\nYou do have to go ahead and add PDF Writer as a new printer with Preview first.\n\nA: As an alternative if you cannot get reader working, the process of printing and scanning your document seems laborious, have you thought of just a screenshot of the document? This should be digitally exactly the same, and you could even open it in preview and \"Print to PDF\" as you wanted. \nThis would also be not editable in the fashion you said.\n\nA: I am not sure if this will work for all of the PDF files, but I was having the same issue when printing today. I looked up several solutions and everything seems overly complex.

I check marked the 'print file as image' option and it printed. It took a bit for the printer to start but I worked, everything came out in the correct resolution and none of the colors/text fields were changed. \nI am sure this won't solve everyone's problem but hopefully it give you another option to try!\n\nA: I found the easiest solution was to take one of my existing printers (a Brother HL-2270DW), and pause it (from Printers and Scanners ... Open Print Queue). Then, print to this printer from Adobe Reader, but since it is paused, it will not print yet, and just queue it up. Once that is done, you can follow similar steps as user65535 above, and grab the raw printer files from /var/spool/cups. The files are named d* and can be either PDF or PS format. If they are PDF, you can open them in Preview directly. If they are PS, then Preview will convert it to a PDF file, and then view it - you can then save this PDF.\nWith these steps, I was able to fill out a form in Acrobat Reader, and then create a PDF that prints properly on my Mac. I didn't have to install any extra 3rd party software. If you still have problems, using \"Print to image\" in Adobe Acrobat will force it to rasterize the printer output.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this is what I did after reading this question and answer\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed a network printer localhost, I chose HP Laserjet Series PCL 4/5 as the driver\n\n*Print a document from adobe reader\n\n*Open Terminal.app and type the following:\nsudo -s\ncd /private/var/spool/cups\nls -lh\nTotal 1048  \n-rw------- 1 root _lp 1.6K Jan 18 16:24 c00001  \n-rw------- 1 root _lp 1.7K Jan 18 16:40 c00002  \nDrwxrwx--- 10 root _lp 340B Jan 18 16:40 cache  \n-rw-r----- 1 root _lp 259K Jan 18 16:23 d00001-001  \n-rw-r----- 1 root _lp 254K Jan 18 16:39 d00002-001  \nDrwxrwx--T 3 root _lp 102B Jan 18 16:39 tmp\n\nLooking at the timestamp and size, easy to see that d00001-001 and d00002-001 are the postscript files I just printed from Adobe Reader.\n\n\n*pstopdf d00002-001\nAnd you have a d00002-001.pdf file,\nChange the owner of this file then move this file out to desktop\n(replace username with your actual username)\n\n\n*chgrp username d00002-001.pdf\n\n*mv d00002-001.pdf ~username/Desktop\nAnd there you have it, without having to install any thirdparty pkg or drivers.

It's made for OS X 10.11 El Capitan, so no worries about sandbox/security issued.\nAfter the easy installation you'll get a new \"printer\" called PDFwriter which works like a charm from Adobe Acrobat Reader. The \"printed\" PDF files always end up in the \"Shared\" folder; check /Users/Shared/PDFwriter and the subfolder named after your user.\n\nA: OK, just throwing another horribly convoluted solution onto the pile. I've found that Amazon's Send to Kindle for Mac works for converting these PDFs. I happened to have it installed already (so preferable to installing three extra flaky PDF printer drivers which may or may not work in my case), and it worked fine. The difficult was that getting a standalone PDF was needlessly complex. You can't download a PDF from your Kindle \"Manage your content\" page on Amazon (AFAICT), so you have to send it to a third-party device. \nPDF Documents, including those from the \"Send to Kindle\" virtual printer, can be sent to a physical Kindle, or an iOS device's Kindle app, but not, inexplicably, a desktop Kindle app, and also possibly not even an Android device (!). So I had to send to my iPhone. Once it's on your iOS device (or maybe a hardware Kindle, I'm not sure), you can download the document, and then use the \"Share\" link to email it to yourself.

My experience confirmed what bmike said in the accepted answer:\n\nIf Adobe isn't preparing the file for print until after you hit print in the Adobe dialog - then your only recourse is faking it out by defining a new virtual printer.\"\n\nI installed PDFwriter and it worked like a charm. Very easy to install; still works perfectly in OS X Yosemite even though the last release was in 2011.\n\nA: I came across this question because I was facing the same problem in April 2012 using Mac OS X Lion\nI found another solution which was to use Print to VipRiser\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=201009220739460\nHope this helps other users.\n", "Q: Can't format an external HDD :Error: -9944: File system formatter failed I have MacOs 10.6.6 and a Western Digital external 2.5'' HDD USB 3.0 pre-formatted to NTFS. I try to format the drive do HSF+ with DiskUtility program, but it says:\nError: -9944: File system formatter failed\nI think I've tried almost all combinations; I tried to set up 1 or 2 partitions with different sizes; journaled or not, but nothing works.\nI don't care about the data; I just need the drive to be HFS.\n\nA: maybe you can try using gparted on a linux livecd?\n\nA: It's probably a MBR partitioned drive and you hit some obscure error in the mac trying to put a newer file system on a legacy partition scheme.\nHave you tried partitioning the drive as GUID Partition Map Scheme under options? I've had luck sometimes changing first to APM and then back to GUID to clear up a corrupt partition record.\nIf you posted the contents of the disk utility log when attempting this showing a little more information that might help as well. Lastly - what are the current values that Disk Utility reports for Total Capacity as well as Partition Map Scheme?\n\nA: When you setup the drive partitions, click the option button at the bottom of the disk utility window and change the drive to type GUID.  Then proceed to select how many partitions you want and what format you want them in.  This should totally wipe the partition information and let you format the drive as HFS.\n", "Q: How do you set the TCP congestion control algorithm on OS X? I would like to set the TCP congestion control algorithm to Westwood+. Is this possible in OS X?\n\nA: According to http://www.macgeekery.com/gspot/2006-03/mac_os_x_network_tuning_guide you can actually modify the algorthims used by Mac OS X by using  the sysctl command, but you cannot use anything but the New Reno algorithm:\n\nnet.inet.tcp.newreno implements the New Reno modification to the TCP Fast Recovery Protocol (RFC 2582). New Reno is the name given to an enhancement to TCP partial acknowledgments that is used in the absence of a stack that supports SACKs. Keep in mind that while this shouldn’t cause problems in the normal case, it’s only really useful over a congested link like, say, checking mail while streaming NPR or similar. Even then, it’s not a magic bullet. No harm in turning it on, but understand what it is and isn’t, first. It’s off by default.\n\nThe command is\nsysctl -w net.inet.tcp.newreno=1\nwhich you could reverse with sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.newreno=0 if you had issues with it.\n", "Q: Xserve shuts itself off and boots at will Okay, there's a lot of smart Mac guys here, so lets see if any of you can figure out this stumper.\nOur Xserve G4 (RackMac1,1) went incommunicado a few years ago was left in this state until I pulled it out yesterday. I started my mission with a triple PRAM zap, and like clockwork it decided to boot perfectly into Mac OS X Tiger Server.\nI decided to upgrade it to Leopard, this machine only has a CD drive, so I hooked it up to my MBP via FireWire and attempted to burn the install DVD to one of the hard drives (since all it's data is irrelevant / four years old anyhow). It starts copying just as always on the various computers I've done this to, it says \"20 minutes remaining\", so I leave the server room to go do other things. I come back 20 minutes later to a MBP saying \"18 minutes remaining\", and a shut down Xserve.\nRinse and repeat this process. Perhaps something weird happened.\nI decide perhaps it doesn't like being in FireWire target disk mode and boot it back up to Tiger to download the disk image and burn it to the hard drive. After about 10 minutes of uptime, it just shuts down. Not even a soft shutdown. Total loss of power. I had some other stuff to do in the server room and after about 15 minutes I look back and there it is, fully booted, sitting at the login screen.\nI ask you, what sentient force has made a victim of my Xserve?! :(\n\nA: The original G4 Xserve was prone to structural 'sagging' after spending a while in a rack. I'm not aware of any specific fix for this problem, which causes random kernel panics / shut-downs / other weirdness; later model XServes were not affected (not sure when exactly, but I've never seen this on any intel xserves, while I did see it on a significant number of g4 serves).\nhttp://tidbits.com/article/11735\nSorry for the bummer news :/ If you can get your hands on a late-model intel xserve, they still hold up pretty well. I use several of them on a regular basis.\n\nA: Make sure that the fans/blowers are connected and the heat sink is properly attached to the processor. Could be warming up and getting too hot and the thermal sensor tells the Xserve to shut off to save itself. Possible, but unlikely. Weird that it would restart.\nReset the PMU (power management unit). If it has been sitting a while this may help. \nReplace the power supply.\nLogic board replacement. You'd be better off getting a used working G5.\nJust some thoughts... \nHope it helps. \n", "Q: Java developer planing to buy Mac I'm mostly a Java developer and have been developing on Linux for the past 5 years. I'm pretty happy with Linux but time to time I need to run proprietary software that is not supported on Linux so I've decided to give Mac a try.\nI was wondering if anyone has any advice like how do you organize your development environment.\n\nA: For what it's worth, many of the applications running on GNU/Linux are also available for the Mac. I use Eclipse and Git routinely on a Mac. Since I'm still on OS X 10.5, the first thing I did was to set my default JRE version to 1.6 (Mac bundles 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6), since the default setting is 1.5 (not sure if that's still the case with Snow Leopard).\n\nA: I used Windows and Linux in the past for developing web applications.\nI decided to switch to Mac two years ago and that was my best decision, I'm fully satisfied with the hardware and even more satisfied with the operating system.\nI'm using Eclipse for developing Java and of course MacVim for any other. It's a good idea to install MacPorts with which you can easily install the missing utilities and libraries, which is not a lot, because MacOS is shipped with tons of unix (FreeBSD) stuff.\n\nA: I am a Java developer, developing web applications for e-commerce and publishing, and have been exclusively using a Mac for many years.\nBeing Unix-based (a form of Free BSD, to be precise), MacOS has everything you would already be familiar with for Java development on other Unix-like platforms. \nIt has bash and all the command line Unix tools. It has subversion support built in, and Apache installed by default. Apple builds and distributes a MacOS-specific full JRE and JDK stack. You can download and install everything else you need on top of that.\nI personally use Eclipse, JBoss and Tomcat, ANT and Maven, and MySQL - with various plugins and third party libraries, and have had no issues.\nThe biggest advantages, however, to using a Mac for development are\n\n\n*\n\n*you can run the \"big two\" - Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop. I am not sure what your feelings are about this, but sometimes it is important to use the actual apps rather than behave-alikes so you get full fidelity and compatibility with what everyone else in your organisation may be using.\n\n*there are so many beautifully designed and well thought out Mac-native apps and utilities that help boost your productivity. (after all, programming is only one part of my professional day)\nThe only negative thing I can think of is that many \"enterprise\" products that are part of a Java application developer's stack, often have a native component even though most of the product is Java. Often, the native component only runs on Linux and Windows. However, the way around this is to run virtual machines. I often run non Mac-native core components in a Linux VM using VMWare Fusion. \nAlso, Java is not a first-class citizen on the Mac. When Apple first came out with Xcode and Cocoa, they started with supporting Objective-C and Java as equal-footing languages, but over time they removed or lessened support for Java. To me, this is a bit disappointing, but is actually no different than Windows or Linux (you can't write first-class native applications on either using the Java language). It's just that I'm too old and too set in my ways to have to Objective-C!\n\nA: Snow Leopard has a Java 6 installed by default.\nAfter that, you can use any Java tool you are used to, like Eclipse and NetBeans, which I both use without any issue.\nYou then have access to all other common dev tools like Git, SVN, etc...\nAs of today, I didn't have any issue with a tool I was not able to install on my MBP for Java development.\nThe only risk is the will to shift to Objective-C for native application development ;-)\n\nA: Netbeans and Eclipse are good on the Mac. They both have pretty comprehensive plug-in support for source control and other IDE enhancements, you couldn't go wrong with either one.\n\nA: I personally use Eclipse + Android SDK (and the corresponding Android Plug-in). Although I really don't like Java that much (I believe .NET has a slightly better framework and C#'s magic is more clear than Java), the environment works OK most of the time. \nEclipse and more specifically the Android tools are literally vomitive when compared to Xcode. The Android simulator could be easily confused by a April Fool's joke and it's slower than Windows Vista on a newly purchased laptop :) Sometimes you have to kill the processes running in the background because the Simulator will crash upon startup :s\nEclipse itself is \"ok\" I guess, tho' aesthetically speaking it looks very dated and some of the commands are clunky. In some areas it has better \"little things\" than Xcode (especially 4 that lacks some things). Yes, it supports a lot of things through plug-ins, but some do not work or cause the whole eclipse to go crazy. \nBut other than that, which has nothing to do with Mac at all and is more related to the buggy Android plug-in, the Macintosh environment is very nice if you get used to it. Tools like Launchbar or Alfred (or even QuickSilver if you can live with the sometimes buggy state) will open a new world for you.\nThe nice Versions (svn) or GitTower (git) coupled with Kaleidoscope for diff make you think how much time to these developers have put into the attention to detail part of developing software; at the same time, it makes you wonder, what other pieces of software are there waiting to make you feel right at home.\n\nA: I developed professional webapps for years on a mac without any problems. I worked with Java 5 and 6, Eclipse, Ant, Tomcat and Subversion. Also PostgreSQL, Idea, Git, Maven, Firefox, nice Open Source text editors like Smultron and many more tools are available, not forget the Terminal to run shell scripts (drag & drop files from the Finder directly to the Terminal to get the absolute path pasted in). All you need in a well integrated OS ;-)\nThe only little problem is the case insensitive filesystem, with may result in problems when renaming files with a version control system - but that is the same under Windows.\n", "Q: Why is my Mac \"falling asleep\" when it's told not to? MY power settings are for \"NEVER\" when it comes to sleeping with AC power. AC power is always on. So why always when I come to the Mac after hours of being away, it awakes from sleep, loads up all the programs, signs back into skype etc. Where is the hidden setting that causes it to do that?\nIt only does it at home, another MBP I have at work doesn't exhibit this strange behavior.\n\nA: Is your computer actually sleeping, or is it a display sleep that looks like a real sleep?\nWhat about the other options in Energy Saver, like \"Put hard disk to sleep when possible\" (unchecking this may help with being logged out of some chat programs) and \"Wake for network access\" (checking this helps with other chat programs)?\nAlso check the schedule button to make sure no sleep schedule got accidentally set.\nIn my experience, all of the sleep options are controlled from the Energy Saver panel, so I'd check your system preferences first.  If that doesn't do it, check the settings in any third-party system extensions you have that might deal with power or computer performance.\n\nA: Check Your Log Files\nYou can use the Console.app application to review your Mac's system.log. This file will include entries stating when your Mac went to sleep. You may even be lucky enough to see an entry hinting at why sleep was initiated.\nConfirm Your Active Energy Saving Settings\nYou can check the current Energy Saving settings using the pmset command line tool.\nThe following command will display all the energy saving settings. You will need to enter this command in the Terminal.app in Applications > Utilities:\npmset -g\n\nIn the results, look for the sleep, displaysleep, and disksleep values. These are all measured in minutes.\nThe pmset manual explains what the various settings mean and the options you can change using this tool.\n", "Q: How to turn off spindle of internal HDD on MacBook from command line? I'm going put SSD drive instead of DVD and move OS-X to SSD.\nBig capacity HDD I'm gonig leave to have some place for large multimedia data and archives.\nSo I whant keep HHD in spindle off mode most time and mount it just on demand, what should I do to prevent HDD to be mounted and powered while system boot (after restart) and how to manage spindle with the command line?\nThank you!\n\nA: to disable the drive from mounting during boot :\nFind the uuid of the drive (in terminal):\ndiskutil info /Volumes/[name]\n\nThen create a new file called /etc/fstab and in it put\nUUID=34DFD44D-489C-1C22-01D8-DFDF288C102F none hfs rw,noauto 0 0\n\njust replace the UUID above with the actual UUID of the drive.\nUse the following command to view a list of drives/partitions\ndiskutil list\n\nAnd then issue the mount command to mount the drive\nsudo mount /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/DriveName\n\nObviously change the disk id and mount folder to suit your system.\n\nA: sudo diskutil eject /dev/disk1 will turn off spindle\n", "Q: Is it safe for the hard disk drive to operate while MacBook Pro is positioned vertically? There is a nice designed product: Twelve South BookArc. You can save some space and increase wow-factor of your workspace a bit.\nBut is it safe for HDD to operate a Macbook when it is not parallel to the Earth surface?\n\nA: It is safe to operate the HDD this way. There are many servers that use HDDs vertically.\nYour main concern, while operating this way, would be the slightly worse cooling. The Twelvesouth guys are saying that they deliver better cooling, but they are comparing it to a closed and put on the table notebook. My experience shows that the best way to keep the notebook cool is to keep the lid open. If I want to use only my external monitor, I close it, wake it with the external keyboard/mouse and then reopen the lid (only the external monitor works and the cooling is best). Note that if you're not doing CPU/GPU heavy things (gaming, transcoding movies), you'll be ok.\n", "Q: Any way to make multiple files stop hiding their extension? How can I make multiple files show their extension at once? Any finder setting and/or terminal command would be nice.\n\nA: Not sure what your goal is, but you make Finder show all extensions by default by selecting Show all filename extensions in Finder -> Preferences -> Advanced.\n", "Q: how to send scheduled mails with Mail? I would love to send mails in my apple mail scheduled!\nWhat is the most comfortable way to do that?\nonly method i found: http://homepage.mac.com/aamann/Mail_Scripts.html\n(but this is quite tricky + buggy)\n\nA: Mail.app has no built-in function to send scheduled mails. You can use Automator to achieve the same result, though.\nOpen Automator and select \"New iCal Alarm\". Drag \"New Mail Message\" to the workflow. It will bring up a small composition window, just like in Mail.app. \nDrag \"Send Outgoing Messages\" to the workflow. You can test it at this point to make sure that it's properly set up.\nSave it. iCal should automatically open, and you can drag the event wherever/whenever you like. The message will be sent when the alarm is triggered.\n", "Q: Emacs on Mac OS X - To Alt or Command? It's official. I love to hate Emacs on Mac OS X.\nNo matter what I do, I get a thorn in side.\nWhen I try to write \\ using Alt + Shift + 7 I get errors because Alt == Meta in Emacs. If I bind the Meta to the Command key I circumvent that error. All is fine. Till I want to use Meta-Tab. Now I'm suddenly trying to Command-Tab away from Emacs into some other application.\nI'm furious at the moment, could anyone help me solve this problem? I would prefer it if I could have Alt as meta, not install aquamacs.org and not use the fn key.\nOh, by the way, I use Swedish locale.\nEDIT 1:\nFirst solution: add (global-set-key [C-tab] [M-tab]) to ~/.emacs. This will tie the Meta-tabto Control-tab instead. Not what I entirely wanted, but should work.\n\nA: I have the same problem when I came from Linux to macOS, and I resolved it by add following codes to my emacs config file:\n;; check OS type\n(cond\n ((string-equal system-type \"windows-nt\") ; Microsoft Windows\n  (progn\n    (message \"Microsoft Windows\")))\n ((string-equal system-type \"darwin\") ; Mac OS X\n  (progn\n    (setq mac-option-key-is-meta nil)\n    (setq mac-command-key-is-meta t)\n    (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)\n    (setq mac-option-modifier nil)\n    (message \"Mac OS X\")))\n ((string-equal system-type \"gnu/linux\") ; linux\n  (progn\n    (message \"Linux\"))))\n\nPlease notice this part of codes that have commented with 'Mac OS X', it'll swap option key with command key in emacs application, but in the whole view, command is still command, you can use command+tab just like before.\n\nA: Some people I know always buy Macs with US keyboards for exactly this reason.\nI cursed at Emacs too (in Swedish, as well) and the only solution I've found is to use the US Extended layout, but using my Swedish keyboard. I spent several years with a US keyboard as my main keyboard so I can switch more or less without thinking.\nIf you're not willing to go the layout-switching route, OS X Emacs in Swedish is just painful.\n\nEdit: Just found a hint for Spanish that might be of help. The idea is to remap the character that gets sent to Emacs to the one you desire. I haven't tried it, but it sounds promising.\n\nA: It's not really elegant, but you could use the Escape key for meta and keep the alt key for special characters. E.g. ESC x instead of M-x.\nBut agree with molbdnilo, most non-US keyboards suck for programming. I once worked in Finland for a couple of weeks, and the first thing I did was switch the KB to US. Even blind typing was easier than figuring out how to type those characters you need so often in programming languages. (well, actually the first thing I did was to switch the language; fortunately I knew how to do that by muscle memory :-)\n\nA: See the options under M-x customize-group ns\nThere you can adjust the behavior of the modifier keys. I have set the right alt to \"No modifier\" - that's the same behavior as on PC keyboards with Alt-Gr.\nAnother setting I like is to unset both alt keys and use the function key instead for alt.\n\nA: I have also had this problem for years! Just recently I tried out Emacs in OS X again. I finally fixed the problem by adding the following in my .emacs: (This is with Emacs 24.3)\n(when (eq system-type 'darwin)\n  (setq mac-right-option-modifier 'none))\n\n\nA: I am not sure if it encompasses all your needs but yes I understand the problem with Meta and have it from time to time when I fresh install Emacs. Here is what I can suggest simply:\nJust in your init.el or whatever is your emacs startup config file, set mac option modifier to 'meta and mac right option modifier to nil, in that order.\nThat way:\n\n*\n\n*You will be able to use right option as a normal mac Alt key for special chars like #, $, {, [, ], } that requires Alt as usual\n\n*You will be able to use the left option key as a normal Emacs Meta key.\n\n*You won't need to mess with command (cmd) key.\n\n*You won't even need ESC x combination which is still there for Meta\nAdd the following in your .init.el file:\n(setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)\n(setq mac-right-option-modifier nil)\n\n", "Q: Restore Things to iPhone from iTunes I ended AT&T service with my iPhone, but would still like for it to be useful. When the service was ended, Things was in the process of being updated, and I deleted it from my iPhone (not iTunes) in the hope of restoring it. I've tried a few things, but while Things is still visible in iTunes, it hasn't shown up in my iPhone.\nIs there any way that I can restore Things from iTunes to my iPhone?\n\nA: If you're absolutely sure that you have SYnced the phone and the app is still not there, you can try to remove it from iTunes too. Then you go to the App Store (make sure you are logged with the SAME account you were when you bought it for the first time) and buy it again, the store will inform you that it's \"a free upgrade\" and will re-download it. It will not charge you again.\n\nA: Make sure it is selected as an application that syncs to the iPhone.  If it is visible in iTunes then it should still be able to be synced.  If that doesn't work then open up the app store on the iphone and install it from there.  You won't be charged as you have already purchased it.\n\nA: If you have back up your content, you can restore from the backup.\nTo restore information from a backup, use one of the following methods after connecting your iOS device to the computer with which you normally sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click (or Control-click) the device and choose Restore from Backup\n\n*If you have a new phone, you can connect to iTunes and it will prompt to restore from your backup\nSolution from Apple.com: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766\n", "Q: Problem importing iPhoto library in Aperture I just bought a new MBP and I copied the iPhoto '10 library of my old iMac to the Pictures folder of my MBP.\nThen I opened iPhoto '11, it said that it has to update the library.\nTo that point it was just fine and I have my compete library in iPhoto '11 on the MBP.\nThen I tried to import the iPhoto '11 library in Aperture and that's my problem: Apertures says it can only import libraries from iPhoto of version 7.x or newer.\nMy iPhoto '11 library is of course version 9.1.1 so I don't understand the problem. It is however true that the library was first build with iPhoto 08 (or 07 I don't really remember).\nDo you have an idea were the problem comes from ? Is there a hidden feature of iPhoto allowing to \"consolidate\" the library (as in iTunes) ?\n\n\nA: Not sure if this will solve your problem but it might be a good starting point.\nTry rebuilding the iPhoto library. You can do this by holding down the Command and Option keys while opening iPhoto. You will then need to choose the rebuild options. I think it would probably pay to select all of them. iPhoto will then work away for a long time and rebuild the library.\nThere is an Apple support web page that details this process further. I would normally say that you should keep a backup before making any changes like this but I guess you still have the copy of the library on the old iMac\nIf the rebuild doesn't help then I'm not really sure what you can do.\n\nA: You could get this error if your copy of Aperture doesn't have the latest updates.\n\nA: As of Aperture 3.3, iPhoto and Aperture can now open the same photo libraries, so no importing is necessary.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect automatically to a server on login without an opened window?

(I'm on Snow Leopard)\n\nA: Instead of whatever method you are doing now to mount the server, I would recommend a script which is launched at login for all users.\nYour best options are either a LoginHook or a launchd process installed to /Library/LaunchAgents/ \nYou will then need to figure out the syntax for the mounting the drive.\nUPDATE: \nI decided I wanted to check this out further myself, and created this launchd script:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>luoma.mount.blackbook</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/luomat/Dropbox/bin/mount_blackbook.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nwhich I placed at /Library/LaunchAgents/luoma.mount.blackbook.plist (owned by root)\nThe script  can be found at http://f.luo.ma/mount_blackbook.sh (note: script will display in browser window, to download, use click-click/save-as)\n\nA: In OS X Server, you can specify a share as an 'automount'. Is that what you had in mind?\nThen, when your users authenticate against your Open Directory server, they not only see their desktop, but are automatically connected to a server sharepoint.\n\nA: You could mount them with a simple Automator app that's added to the login items. You would just add a \"Get Specified Servers\" action, add the servers to it, then add a Connect to Servers action. It will mount all the specified servers without opening their windows.\nWhen you add your servers, be sure to include the name of the share point you want to mount, something like afp://10.0.0.1/SharePoint/, otherwise, you'll get the \"select the volumes you want to mount\" dialog.\n\nA: Another option (one which I haven't tried) is to disable Finder opening a new window whenever a new volume is mounted.\nI believe the proper syntax is:\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages auto-open-ro-root -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages auto-open-rw-root -bool false\nOf course this will change the behavior for more than just these particular items.\n", "Q: How to download the .mov for later viewing?

The Option key workaround is only \n  workable on Apple BT and dock keyboards.  As soon as the API changes \n  I'll make sure this gets fixed in iSSH. \n\n\nA: iSSH has a button on the toolbar for exactly this purpose:\n\nTap that button, view that menu, enable the feature!\n", "Q: Play custom audio alert for certain incoming mail I would like my Mac to play a sound when certain email arrives. For example if the subject contains \"xyz\", play \"mycustomsound.mp3\".\nAny easy way to do this?\n\nA: Assuming your using Mail.app, add a mail rule.\nGo to Mail -> Preferences -> Rules. Add a rule based on your criteria (Subject Contains | Is Equal To | Starts with \"xyz\").\nUnder \"Perform the following action\" select \"Play sound\". You can choose a preset sound or select \"Add/Remove\" to set your own custom sound.\n\nA: You can change ALL your Mail sound alerts by doing this:\nRight Click the Mail.app - choose 'Show Package Contents'\nNavigate to 'Resources'. There are 4 .aiff files:\nMail Fetch Error.aiff\nMail Sent.aiff\nNew Mail.aiff (That's the one you can change via the Mail, Preferences, General interface)\nNo Mail.aiff\nTrash whichever one you want to change: you'll need your Administrator password\nFind, create, whatever sound file (It must be the same format, ie: .aiff)\nRename it to the one above that you trashed\nTransfer it to the Resources window\nConfirm your admin password.\n", "Q: Invoke QuickLook in Open/Save dialogue windows A handy tip I discovered by accident.\nHighlight any file in an Open/Save window, press the space bar and voila! there is your file in all it's glory. \n\nA: Well thank you! :D\nThis will certainly be useful.\nJust as a note to everyone who sees this, it apparently only works on the window, not on the dropdown.

This sounds to be the case for you.\nSince you're able to connect to the domain via smb, you should be able to manually add the printer(s). Select the \"Advanced\" button at the top of the Add Printer dialog from your screenshot.\nSelect \"Windows\" from the Type dropdown menu. You can manually enter the printer's smb URL:\nsmb://Windows_name/printer_share_name \nor possibly \nsmb://user:password@Windows_Computer_Name/Shared_Printer_Name\nSelect the appropriate driver and click \"Add\".\nYou can get the full steps on how to manually add a Windows printer from Apple's knowledgebase here.\n\nA: Below are three articles for trying to fix this, but generally you can just type\n\nsmb://workgroup/server/sharename\n\nor\n\nsmb://server/sharename\n\nin the windows dialog and that should work if you cannot see the printers automatically.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X: Cannot locate a shared\nWindows printer \n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1404\n\n\n*Mac OS X 10.5 or earlier:\nTroubleshooting printing issues\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS3140\n\n\n*Mac OS X: How to manually add a\nWindows shared printer\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3049\n\nI had problems printing to windows computers at my work and using these articles, so what I did was manually add the printers by IP address. \n\n\nA: One of the first things I usually do (when it applies) is install the Windows Services for UNIX in the machine with the printer attached. It has fixed most of my problems. In fact OS X usually \"forgets\" or is unable to correctly identify via SMB with the remote printer/computer, even when you have either guest enabled or a specific user saved in your keychain.\nOther than that, try manually browsing to see if you have access to the printer in the first place. If you can manually reach it, then you have a discoverability problem (usually fixed by the above steps) or the steps pointed in other answers. \nFor what is worth, installing those services on XP machines is very simple and it's included with the XP CD. \nYou don't really mention where is the printer connected (Windows Version) so I can only guess. If your printer is attached to Windows 7, I'd take a look at the other answers before going crazy. \n\nA: It may be worth checking the port configuration for the printers. I had a similar issue with wireless Macbooks not seeing a windows shared printer.\nIn the Ports tab under Printer Properties (Windows) there is the option to Configure Port. Changing this from TCP/IP to LPR, and adding lpd://Printer_Name to the Printer/Queue Name box enabled me to see the printer from the MacBook.\n", "Q: Is there any utility or program that will let me assign keyboard shortcuts inside of apps? I'm a web developer, and use a specific IDE for all of my work. It does everything I need it to do, so please don't suggest a host of other IDEs. The only issue I have with it is that there is no keyboard shortcut for printing. It drives me up a wall to have to use the menus for this. I'm new to Mac - is there a program or utility like AutoHotKeys that would let me create keyboard shortcuts that work inside of apps?\n\nA: Usually Command + P is the keyboard shortcut to print. If it's not, you can add your own keyboard shortcut. You shouldn't need any additional apps to do this. It's built right into the Mac.\nGo to System Preferences -> Keyboard. Select Keyboard Shortcuts. At the bottom, click the + button to add a new keyboard shortcut. To add a keyboard shortcut to a specific application, select it from the Application dropdown menu. Enter the name of the command exactly as it appears in the menu (In this case it may simply be \"print\").\nAdditional cool trick \nIf you don't always feel like setting a keyboard shortcut: You can use Command + ? to bring up the Search menu from within the application itself. Start typing in the name of the command you'd like to select. Once you have enough characters, the menu item should be highlighted. Hit Return and it will select that menu item. Instant keyboard shortcut!\n**EDIT**\nSince you specified that this issue is about Komodo Edit there's some good news and bad news:\nThe bad news:\nKomodo Edit, like Firefox, is built using XUL. Many XUL applications have an ongoing bug when it comes to respecting keyboard shortcuts set from System Preferences on the Mac. Namely, they don't. (If anyone has any solutions or comments about this please let me know)\nThe good news:\nKomodo Edit lets you set your own keyboard shortcuts from within the application! Go to Preferences -> Editor -> Key Bindings, search \"Commands\" for \"Print\", select it, and assign whatever keyboard shortcut you like.\n", "Q: How to manually trigger background image change? I have set the wallpaper to change every hour and have enabled it to cycle them in a random order. Sometimes the background image changes to an image that was set just few rounds ago and I'd like to rechange it to something else.\nHow to trigger the background change manually? So that next random image in the folder is chosen and the crossfade effect is played.\nI'd love to hear a command line solution, and would rather not install third party software (although, if you have something to share, don't let me to hold you back — someone might find it useful).\n\nA: I have found this MacWorld post showing an AppleScript that you can execute to force that.\n\nI have my desktop images set to change every 30 minutes in random order. Sometimes the desktop will display an image that displayed earlier in the day, and I wanted a way to 'advance' the image easily. The following AppleScript will cause the desktop image to change, in whatever order you have set, each time it is run:\n\nAnd this is the script:\nproperty theSwitch : 0\nif theSwitch = 0 then\n  tell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current desktop\n      set change interval to 1801.0\n    end tell\n  end tell\n  set theSwitch to 1\nelse\n  tell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current desktop\n      set change interval to 1800.0\n    end tell\n  end tell\n  set theSwitch to 0\nend if\n\nPlease check the link and the comments for more similar or complete alternatives.\nNote: I have not tested this. \nUPDATE I'm sorry to hear that it didn't work for you, yet it does for me on Snow Leopard with the following script:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current desktop\n        set initInterval to get change interval -- get the currrent display interval\n        set change interval to -1 -- force a change to happen right now\n        set change interval to initInterval -- change it back to the original display interval\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nWARNING\nThis assumes that you have\n[X] \"change picture ever x timesteps\"\n[X] Random Order\nThe above works for me. I ran it from the AppleScript Editor several times to make sure it was working and it indeed does change the Wallpaper.\n\nA: Apoloiges for replying to an old question.\nThanks @koiyu for that code, it's confirmed working in Mountain Lion. However, if you're using multiple monitors, it only works on the first monitor. I slightly modified your code to make it work on all monitors.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with thisDesktop in every desktop\n        tell thisDesktop\n            set initInterval to get change interval\n            set change interval to initInterval\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nInterestingly, if you are using multiple spaces with Mission Control, it will only change the wallpapers on all monitors of your currently focused space. You can switch to another space and run it again to change the wallpapers on that space. Hope this helps!\n\nA: @Martín's answer works flawlessly in Snow Leopard. However, in Lion, every change of the change interval results to a background change, ie. the background gets changed two times when the script is run.\nWorry not, it is easily fixed: just set the change interval as whatever it is currently set to:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current desktop\n        set initInterval to get change interval\n        set change interval to initInterval\n     end tell\nend tell\n\nIt is a bit tautological, sure, but it works.\n", "Q: Media controls in chrome for Mac Now Spotify is useless I've shifted Grooveshark, however there's a distinct lack of being able to use the media controls at the top of the keyboard to control it.\nIs there an extension or (non-web)app to enable this?

I'd like to remap these to the media controls, and if possible not have to have focus on Chrome and the grooveshark tab.\n\nA: If you use the desktop client for OS X grooveshark says they have enabled keyboard shortcuts: \n\nhttp://wanderr.com/jay/keyboard-shortcuts-for-grooveshark-desktop/2010/06/05/\n\nBut if you want to use the web player, it looks like it might be a lost unless you use Firefox for which there is an addon named keySharky: \n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keysharky/\n\n", "Q: Will reducing the number of or disabling spaces improve performance? If I turn off spaces on my MacBook, or reduce the number of spaces, will that improve graphics performances?\nEDIT:\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.6.7 Snow Leopard on a MacBook 7,1 with 2GB of memory\n\nA: I checked it out in Instruments and I could barely notice a different in the activity monitor instrument, probably because I am looking at CPU and RAM bound items. \nThere obviously is going to be a higher load on the GPU than if there were no spaces at all, but I doubt its drawing everything in all spaces at all times, and like Martin said, it all depends.\nThe real possibility is that with so much extra space that you run many other programs which in one space you would find cluttered and would have automatically closed them due to aesthetic reasons. \n\nA: It all really depends. Truth is, you'll see some memory improvement in the spaces application and of course one less \"daemon\" running in the background. Switching to spaces is a GPU (and to some degree) CPU operation and also memory (both RAM and VRAM) is interacting in the process. Try disabling spaces and work for a few days. \nYou also don't mention your OS version or your amount of RAM. What Macbook do you have? Perhaps the best improvement comes from adding more RAM.\n", "Q: Huge fonts in Skype 5.1 I have huge fonts in the messaging window, and there I can't find a configuration item to change it.\nIt's the new Skype 5.1 for Mac.\nWhy did this happen, and how can I restore the fonts to their normal sizes?\n\nA: If you are having an application issue on Mac OS X, and it is not something that is expected behavior, a good first step is to quit the program, remove the user specific .plist files for that application, and then relaunch it. If regenerating the .plists doesn't work, it is probably time to reinstall Skype. \nIf this change is just a result of intended behavior (i.e. an update changed the way the program works), I recommend uninstalling and downloading a previous version to your liking.\nhttp://mac.oldapps.com/skype.php\n", "Q: Mac - External hard drive backups I have two external hard drives, WD 320GB and a WD 1TB.\nI would like to backup my WD 320GB on a regular basis.

KIS Principle, that makes me think of archlinux. Its community is big and very active.\n(see also macports which brew doesn't replace completely, I prefer installing packages with brew, but some complex ones are only on macports)\nSee also brew tap command which provides some missing formulas that can be useful like when you need latest php version > brew tap josegonzalez/php.\n(Homebrew has a policy of not replacing system components, but hey, sometimes you have to)\n\nA: Lunchy (Free)\n\nA friendly wrapper for launchctl.

You won't have to type the whole name.\nExample:\ncd project1\nj p will now take you straight to the full project1 path.\nNow what if you create a similar folder called project2 which you also access often (but less than project1), Autojump will assign a lesser weight to project2 and take you straight to project1.\nIf you hit TAB after typing \"pro\" for instance, your shell will display project__, hinting at the fact that there are more than 1 matching directory. Another TAB hit will display the list of matching directories and allow you to select the one you mean.\nNote: I've recently installed ZSH and noted some interference due to the autocomplete features. Autojump works perfectly on a vanilla Terminal.\n\nA: Solarized (Free)\nColor scheme for Terminal.\nLion supports ANSI colors so hack-y things like SIMBL are no longer required.\nFor Snow Leopard and earlier, you'll need SIMBL installed to make the most of it since color support in Terminal.app is limited.\n\nA: MacPorts\n\nThe MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Mac OS X operating system.\n\nMany people will tell you don't use macport, use homebrew instead. That is mostly true, homebrew is lighter and easier to use. But macports offers way more packages, and some of them will never come to homebrew, because of their different philosophy. (I use both, for different needs)\nFor example, I recommend GTK in its quartz (native OSX) variant :\nsudo port install gtk2 +no_x11+quartz\n\nThen when you install a package that can benefit from it, like wireshark... You will get a native OSX UI, faster and looking much better than X11...\n\nA: DTerm (Free) by Decimus Software\nSimilar to Visor, but with some extra friendly features (also appears to be in active development)\n\nA: The Silver Searcher (Free)\nA code-searching tool similar to ack, but faster.\nInstall it with brew\nbrew install the_silver_searcher\n\n\nA: Jodies.de ipcalc\n   /usr/local/Cellar/ipcalc/0.41: 4 files, 40K, built in 2 seconds\n bash-3.2$ ipcalc 10.20.30.40/8\n Address:   10.20.30.40          00001010. 00010100.00011110.00101000\n Netmask:   255.0.0.0 = 8        11111111. 00000000.00000000.00000000\n Wildcard:  0.255.255.255        00000000. 11111111.11111111.11111111\n =>\n Network:   10.0.0.0/8           00001010. 00000000.00000000.00000000\n HostMin:   10.0.0.1             00001010. 00000000.00000000.00000001\n HostMax:   10.255.255.254       00001010. 11111111.11111111.11111110\n Broadcast: 10.255.255.255       00001010. 11111111.11111111.11111111\n Hosts/Net: 16777214              Class A, Private Internet\n\nIt is also available in HomeBrew:\n bash-3.2$ brew install ipcalc\n ==> Downloading http://jodies.de/ipcalc-archive/ipcalc-0.41.tar.gz\n\n\nA: I like Color Maven\nalias maven=\"command mvn\"\ncolor_maven() {\n  maven $* | sed -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ \\-.*\\)/[36;01m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ >>> .*\\)/[32;01m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ <<< .*\\)/[32;01m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ Building .*\\)/[36;01m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ \\[.*\\)/01m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ BUILD SUCCESS\\)/[01;32m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[INFO\\]\\ BUILD FAILURE\\)/[01;31m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[WARNING\\].*\\)/[01;33m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(WARN.*\\)/[01;33m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(DEBUG.*\\)/[01;33m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/\\(\\[ERROR\\].*\\)/[01;31m\\1[m/g\" \\\n               -e \"s/Tests run: \\([^,]*\\), Failures: \\([^,]*\\), Errors: \\([^,]*\\), Skipped: \\([^,]*\\)/[32mTests run: \\1[m, Failures: [01;31m\\2[m, Errors: [01;31m\\3[m, Skipped: [01;33m\\4[m/g\"\n}\nalias mvn=color_maven\n\nColor LS\nalias ls='ls -FG'\nexport LSCOLORS=gxBxhxDxfxhxhxhxhxcxcx\n-or-\necho export CLICOLOR >> ~/.bashrc\necho export CLICOLOR >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n", "Q: How can I automatically have my Trash emptied when disk space gets below a certain point? Sometimes my hard drive gets low on space, and various things don't work properly until I empty the Trash and free up some space. I know there are applications that empty the Trash after a set interval—but what I want is an app or script (or other means) to empty the Trash whenever there's e.g. less than 2GB of free space on a given hard drive.\n\nA: I use a third party preference pane Compost that deletes from trash when the disk fills up or if the file has been in trash for a given time. \nThe original download stopped working for me but I have just found this on the author's site instead of the distributer.

The issue seems to be Quicktime, and, unfortunately, Final Cut.\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to what I can do, short of transcoding these files to another intermediate format, to get these files to display properly in QuickTime/Final Cut?\n\nA: You can use ClipWrap ($50) to rewrap your AVCHD videos to a Quicktime/Final Cut compatible format.\nThen, deinterlace your videos using JES Deinterlacer and export them preserving full quality (huge files though).\nSo the workflow is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add videos to ClipWrap, select as output the \"Rewrap (don't alter video samples)\" option and save them to a new location.\n\n*Open JES Deinterlacer and drop all videos to input's \"hot-box\"\n\n*Select Project properties:\n\n\n*\n\n*For 1080p30 go to Project > Deinterlace > Top Field, Adaptive, Local\n\n*For 720p60 go to Project > Standards conversion > 1280x720 60p\n\n\n*Finally, go to Output > Export > QuickTime Movie\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Compression Type > Apple ProRes 422 (LT)\n\n*and export the video!\n\n\n\nSo, your videos will be ready to import them to Final Cut.\nI hope that helped!\nEdit:\nIf you want to transcode the video files, just for viewing them in Quicktime, then you would have to select H.264 when exporting from JES Deinterlacer, than the Apple ProRes which is suitable for editing.\n", "Q: Can't see my downloaded app on iPad I bought the Spark Radio app through iTunes and apparently it was downloaded, but I don't see the app on the iPad.

I need to buy a MacBook for iPhone development, but I have budget constraints also.\nI saw on Apple UK website that they are offering refurbished laptop(s).\nSo is it OK to buy a MacBook (refurbished) by Apple?\nHere is one of the link of refurbished MacBook Pro.\n\nA: A) I've never had a problem buying refurbs (> 20 for work)\nB) You may find little bonuses when opening up your new toy.  More RAM/HD/SSD than advertised, because Apple often don't remove these from working systems.  In addition, but on shakier ground (both legally and from a configuration management perspective), you may also encounter software packages installed on your 'new' Mac.  Don't count on it, but it has happened to me twice.  I wiped the machines but enjoyed the 'bumped' specs.\n\nA: I bought a refurb Mac Book Pro in 2008. I still have it. A few months ago I replaced the HD with an SSD. I use it with Lion for iphone development work. After the Apple Care ran out, it had a small problem: some of the display backlights occasionally fail to light. This is not a problem when using a large, external monitor. The problem can also be solved by a restart.\n\nA: They write on the refurb store:\n\nWe test and certify all Apple refurbished products and include a one-year warranty.\n\nThey are even eligible to the AppleCare program if you buy it up to 1 year after your purchase.\nSo I don't see what problem you would face. It's a used device but verified, repackaged and certified by Apple.\n\nA: Generally, Apple refurbs are indistinguishable from a new product aside from the packaging. \nI've found http://refurb-tracker.com to be very helpful for tracking which refurb models are in stock and past pricing.  Often stock is limited but it changes daily.\nI'm on my 2nd Apple refurb (MBP) and couldn't see buying any other way in the future unless I needed a bleeding-edge model. \nThe savings should at least pay for AppleCare (buy it on sale at Amazon!)\n\nA: I once had a job that gave me a refurb Mac Book Pro.  Worked great and I really liked it.  Never was I 'reminded' that it was a refurb due to any problems or differences.  It was actually a few months until I even realized, and I had to be told.  I'd definitely recommend the refurb purchase.\nGreat machine, I was sorry to give it up when I left.\n\nA: I'm a big fan of Apple refurbs and always recommend it unless you want something that's a brand new model\n\nA: Bought a 2016 refurb MBP, in 2016. About $500 off (CAD).\nEnded up returning it - it had occasional instant reboots, like when I would plug in an external monitor.  Not many, say 2-3 over a 2 week period, but I was concerned I was getting some kinda unusual lemon - after all someone did return it.  Also some glitchy keyboard but that might have dust and the notorious butterfly keyboards.\nA Genius hardware test didn’t show anything. \nSo, I called up Apple to return it (as if it was new, 2 week period). No questions asked whatsoever, no pressure, and they gave me 2 weeks to ship it back.  So I had it for 4 weeks.  Full refund, not an exchange.\nIt can also be worth it, depending on model and features, to buy used. Right now, I have a 13 day wait for a new 32GB ram MBP 2019 in Vancouver.  Or I can get a refurb (again around $500 CAD off) refurb in 5 days.  Same thing in 2016 — I wanted a 512 SSD which had 10 day delivery wait when new (Apple Canada used to only stock 256 SSDs). \nBottom line:  it saves you some (not a lot on current models) money, but it’s not totally foolproof - I got a glitchy machine.  On the other hand, Apple’s return policies are sufficiently lenient that it’s not risky at all.\n\nA: It is completely fine to buy any refurbished apple device. Apple makes sure they fix everything about a returned device before it sells it as a \"refurbished\" product. As a matter of fact, my iPhone 8 is a refurbished product and it runs PERFECTLY (been 3 years). I can almost guarantee 100% that, that's the case with all apple devices. They're priced slightly low because they've still technically been used before, but that's not to mention that it'll still run like a brand new machine. Go save your bucks bud!\n", "Q: Slow iOS app and firmware update downloads in iTunes All my iOS related downloads (firmware updates and app downloads) are incredibly slow in iTunes. Right now, a single 70 MB app is an estimated 3 hours download making the transfer rate lousy 52 Kbit/s on an 8 MBit/s ADSL.\nWhen I download my .ipsw firmware updates (400 - 600 MB) in a browser from a direct download link (appldnld.apple.com) the transfer rate is normal though.\nI suppose my iTunes is connecting to geographically \"wrong\" servers. Changing Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4) to my ISP's DNS servers doesn't solve the issue.\nIs there a way to improve iTunes download rate?\n\nA: It sounds like the itunes servers are still cached in your DNS cache after changing from Google's DNS severs to your ISPs.\nOnce you change the DNS servers, clear your DNS cache using terminal\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\nI would also quit the iTunes Helper process (via Activity Monitor) and restart iTunes.\n\nA: After almost a year of experiencing this strange behavior, it seems that the issue is solved without my intervention.\nSince last week (end of November 2011) all my iTunes downloads are fast(er). I'm not sure if it's related to Apple's new datacenter(s) or if my ISP changed something. \n\nA: If you disable \"Simultaneous Download\" checkbox … the download speed will be significantly increased :) \n", "Q: How do I create files in Finder without Terminal? On windows, when you right click then you have option to create files.\nI want to do that too on Mac, how can I do that without terminal?\n\nA: What is the intention of creating an empty file? To open it? Then why not simply open the app in the first place?\nBut,\nIf you want to have a couple of files ready to get something started, you can make them, and then use Get Info on them and set the Stationary Pad option. If you then double-click such a file, the app will start with an untitled copy of that stationary file.\nIf you have a few of those stationaries, you can put them in a folder or in the dock for easy access.\nIf you want to create empty files for another purpose, let us know...\n\nA: I myself Always used TextEdit for this job, open TextEdit and save blank page with desire extension in desire location.\nAlso you can use nufile (I didn't test myself)\n\nOr use some applescript.\n\nA: There is a workaround using Automator and Applescript. I tried it out; it works. The only shortcoming is, that you have to click on a file in the folder in order to execute the script.\nHow to create the service\nLaunching Automator and select Service. In the Automator main window at the top right, set the Service Receives Selected drop-down to `Files or Folders. Drag the following actions into the work area:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run AppleScript (in the Utilities section of the library on the left panel). \n\n\nCopy and paste the following script into the code box and compile the code clicking the hammer icon.\non run {input, parameters}\n  tell application \"Finder\"\n    set currentPath to insertion location as text\n    set x to POSIX path of currentPath\n  end tell\n  return x\nend run\n\nBelow that block, insert a new object Set Value of a Variable (in the Utilities section). Click the Variable drop-down and create a new variable calling it CurrentFolder.\nThen, add a New Text File action (from the Text section of the Actions library). Drag the variable you just created (CurrentFolder) from the Variable panel at the bottom of the Automator window to the Where section of the New Text File action.\nClick the New Text File's Options button and select Show This Action When the Workflow Runs. This will allow you to specify the name of new files.\nSave the service and give it a name (e.g. Create New File). \nTry it out in Finder going to the folder where you want to create a new file. Control-click on an existing file within that folder and select Create New File from the Services submenu. A dialog appears asking for a filename. Insert a name with file extension and click Continue. The new file should be there.\nHere is a screenshot of the Automator job (sorry my Mac is German, but I guess you'll understand):\n\n\nA: This is probably a bit out of scope, but with Quicksliver you can create new text files quite easy.\nOpen Quicksilver with the keyboard shortcut, press period ., type some text (or not), switch to the actions and select \"Create file...\".\nAnd Quicksilver is a very handy tool in general.\n", "Q: How do I eject Windows install DVD when running Windows under Boot Camp? I have installed Windows 7 on my Mac via Boot Camp.\nNow I don't know how to eject the Windows 7 install DVD from within Windows. The system is booting into Windows.\n\nA: If you are in Windows already: you can right click a CD in My Computer and choose Eject from the menu options.\nIf you want to eject before booting into Windows, just reboot and hold the left mouse key while rebooting, this is the force disk eject option.\n", "Q: Dual Boot screen is not coming after installing win 7 via boot camp! I have installed the win7 on macbook white (via boot camp), and now I am not getting the dual boot screen at the start up, instead windows is starting by default :(\nHow I can fix this issue? Have I done something wrong when I was installing win 7?\nThanks\n\nA: The Mac will not show the Startup Manager screen to you every time you boot. You can set a \"default\" partition to boot from, or hold \"option\" while it boots to get the Startup Manager.\nTo change the default, you use \"Startup Disk\" under System Preferences for Mac, if you are on Windows you can use the Bootcamp Utility in the system tray.\nAFAIK, I don't think there is a way to get it to show the Startup Manager every time you boot without holding the option key.\n", "Q: Which 2nd hard drive for my MBP 2011? I am looking at options for a 2nd hard drive (SSD is primary) for my 15\" MBP 2011, i initially was going with a 750gb 5400rpm drive but i'm thinking about either of the following 7200rpm  drives.  \n1) Western Digital Scorpio Black WD7500BPKT\n2) Seagate Momentus ST9750420AS\nI will be running lots of Virtual Machines so i'm thinking the faster drive would be a better fit.\nAre there any concerns with noise/vibration/battery drain with either of these faster drives ?\n\nA: I have the Seagate in my 2010 15\" MBP and I have had 0 problems with it.  It's dead silent and there is no vibration.  My battery life stayed pretty much the same after the upgrade, but since you are looking at dual hard drives (I'm assuming you removed your optical drive) I would expect to see a slight drop in your battery life.\nI would stick with the 7200rpm drives over the 5400rpm myself.\n\nA: I ever had issues with seagates drives. That started in the 90s...\nMy last one, a 7200rpm seagate provided in my MBP 2009... was dying after 6 months, losing clusters every day, making scary \"clic\" sounds. My MBP was FROZING around 10~30s at each dead cluster access attempt... at first, one time a week... then several times a day. btw, if your mac freeze occasionally like that one day, check the hard drive with a tool like TechTool Pro, Disk utility won't report nothing.\nOn the other hand, got 4 external Western Digital drives, no issues at all, even with the +5 y/o older one, and that with a pretty intensive use (like running virtual machines).\nThe funniest one is a big 1TB that fall from a table several times and still works perfectly.\nAs a side note, my MBP is now equipped with an Intel SSD + the same seagate model that Apple replaced thanks to warranty. And I don't have problems with it so far, but I'm backuping with Time machine, regularly...\nMaybe I've just been unlucky with seagates, but guess my suggestion :)\nOh and of course, for VMs, 7200rpm is highly recommended (and VMs on SSD are just amazing)\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to display music library in iTunes So assuming that I'm in a playlist I'd like to be able to type a keyboard shortcut and then have my music library display on the main panel and then tab to the search bar and look for a song.\n\nA: Just use Tab.\nIf you start with the focus on the playlist and hit Tab, the focus will go to the sidebar. You can start typing Mus and the Music library will display in the main panel. Hit Tab again. The focus will jump to the search bar. Start typing the song you're looking for. Hit tab again and you're back in the main window where you started.\nYou can use OptionCommand + f to jump to the search box at any time regardless of where the focus is.\nIt sounds like you'd benefit from an app launcher with built-in iTunes launch/search navigation. Quicksilver and LaunchBar are both good choices.\n\nA: The script works perfectly when I run it from the AppleScript editor, but when I run it from the iTunes scripts menu it\n\n\n*\n\n*takes about 7 seconds to run\n\n*changes my view to music, but doesn't leave the cursor in the search field\n\n\nI ensured enable access for assistive devices is checked.  It's frustrating as it does exactly what I want when running from the editor.\nAny idea what could be wrong?\n\nA: A little Applescript along these lines will work:\ntry\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    activate\n    set winname to name of browser window 1\n    set view of window winname to playlist \"Music\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"iTunes\"\n        set (value of text field 1 of window winname) to \"\"\n        set focused of text field 1 of window winname to true\n    end tell\nend tell\non error\n\nbeep 1\nend try\nPut the script in /Users/.../Library/iTunes/Scripts to see it in your iTunes script Menu. You'll have to turn on \"Enable Access for assistive devices\" in the 'Universal Access' Preferences pane to let the script work. You can also add a keyboard shortcut to run the script when you're in iTunes thru the 'Keyboard Shortcuts' pane of the Keyboard preferences pane.\n", "Q: When I try to reinstall Mac OS (after wiping the partition with ubuntu) all i get is a blinking folder I try to install mac os cause I didn't know what I was doing when I installed Ubuntu... I want mac os back but everytime i insert the install dvd and hold option or c all i get is a blinking folder looking back at me. What do I do? \n\nA: The Ubuntu installer probably reformatted the whole drive using ext2 or ext3, whereas current versions of Mac OS X will only install on HFS+. To fix this, boot up with the Mac OS X install CD, then run Disk Utility from the Utilities menu. Disk Utility will let you check to make sure the drive has at least one HFS+ volume on it, and if it doesn't, create one.\n\nA: If you get nothing at all, there are two good articles on Apple's support site to check out and follow through on, they are fairly thorough.\nI know it says gray screen, not a black screen, but it applies\nMac OS X: Gray screen appears during startup\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS2570\nResolve startup issues and perform disk maintenance with Disk Utility and fsck\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417\nWhich you will probably want to see if you can still boot into single user mode to do via Command+S on boot, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492\nIf you cant boot into single user mode and you cant boot to your disc, and you cant ssh into it, then see if you can boot into target disk mode http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1661.

There is also a folder with a question mark flashing in the center of the screen. Does anyone know how to resolve this problem? Thanks!\n\nA: According to Apple you should try a few options:\nCheck the mouse and keyboard\n\n*\n\n*This issue might occur if a mouse or trackpad button is pressed during startup. Make sure the button isn't pressed.\n\n\n*If the issue persists, shut down your Mac with its power button, disconnect any external mouse and keyboard, then turn on your Mac with its power button. If the flashing question mark issue persists, reconnect the keyboard and mouse.\nIf your Mac still starts to a flashing question mark, follow the steps below. If any step resolves the issue, you don't need to continue to the next one.\n\n*\n\n*Select your Mac OS X startup disk with Startup Manager by restarting and holding the Option key. After your Mac starts up, restart again to verify that the flashing question mark does not appear.\n\n\n*If the issue persists, insert your Mac OS X installation disc. Be sure to either use the disc that came with your Mac, or, if you installed a later Mac OS X version from disc, use the newer disc.\n\n\n*MacBook Air note: On a MacBook Air, there are two options for starting up from Mac OS X media: Either connect a MacBook Air SuperDrive to the MacBook Air via the USB port and restart the computer, holding down the C key during startup, or use Remote Install Mac OS X to startup from a system software DVD that's located on a partner computer. Once started up from Mac OS X media, skip to step 3.\n\n\n*Restart the computer, then hold the C key during startup.\n\n\n*From the Utilities menu, choose Disk Utility. Don't click Continue.\n\n\n*Select your Mac OS X disk (named \"Macintosh HD\" by default) in the left side of the Disk Utility window.\n\n\n*Click the First Aid tab.\n\n\n*Click Repair Disk to verify and repair any issues with your Mac OS X startup disk.\n\n\n*After repairing the disk, try to start up normally.\nImportant: If Disk Utility finds issues it cannot repair, you may need to back up as much of your data as possible (or use Time Machine to back up to a different disk), then erase the disk and reinstall Mac OS X.\n\n\n*If the issue persists, and Disk Utility didn't find any irreparable issues, quit Disk Utility, quit the Installer, select your disk when prompted, and restart.\n\n\n*If the issue continues, reset PRAM. Note: After resetting PRAM, if the computer starts up normally, reselect the startup disk in the Startup Disk preferences.\n\n\n*If none of these steps resolve the issue, start up from the Mac OS X Installation disc and reinstall Mac OS X.\nFrom:\nA flashing question mark appears when you start your Mac \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ts1440\n\nA: It means the volume you're trying to boot from is not bootable - perhaps the /System directory has been deleted, or an OS hasn't been installed at all, or the disk could even be failing.\n\nA: It means that the computer can't find a usable disk with a usable operating system on it.\nPut in the Mac OS X Install DVD that came with your computer. Hold down the c key on the keyboard and keep holding it as you turn on the computer.\nTry to reinstall the operating system.

I just got a new 2nd-generation iPod Touch 16GB. I believe I had a 2nd gen iPod Touch 8GB before.. but back when I did if I played a song, the album art would show up for that song on my locked screen. However this new iPod Touch doesn't do that (it just shows the default wallpaper I chose) and I can't seem to find the settings I need for it. Not looking for a jail-breaking solution by the way. Thanks.\n\nA: Have you tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your iPod under the Devices section in the iTunes Source pane. \n\n*Select the Music tab of the iPod settings. The iPod settings are displayed to the right in the main iTunes window.\n\n*Select the \"Display album artwork on your iPod\" checkbox.\n\n*Click Apply to save the changes. The iPod begins to update as soon as Apply is clicked.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with my ipod touch. I spent roughly 5 hours getting album art for all my music and even selected art for the video game tracks.  It would even display on the ipod but just not when it was locked and that bugged me. From browsing google I found a simple solution: Simply power off your ipod and then reboot it.  When it comes back on the problem should be solved, that's what worked for me.  \n", "Q: Is there an easy way to get web page shortcuts on the desktop to use the favicon from the site? All of the web shortcuts on my desktop look the same.  Any reason they can't be using the site icon (favicon) the same way the browsers do?  Is there a way to do it in OSX 10.6?\n\nA: As the favicon is something that is accessible via the web, it is not an impossible request. But I cant seem to find anyway to change an icon without gui work, which means I guess you might be able to do it with Applescript if we are talking an entirely automated solution.\nThe way I had my web location show my favicon as its icon was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag bookmark to Desktop for site I want.\n\n*Select the bookmark and press Cmd + I.\n\n*With the site still open, delete everything but the root TLD and add /favicon.ico (example http://support.apple.com/ts1275 becomes http://apple.com/favicon.ico) and go to that url.\n\n*Right click and copy image in Safari, and then paste on the image of the webloc.\n\n*Profit!\n\n\nHonestly, I think the other websites description of using their images or material from the site is a lot better idea, but this is how you can actually use the favicon.\n\nA: There's not a one-step way of doing this unfortunately.  I agree that it would be a great feature.  However favicons are 16 pixels and most desktop icons are larger than that, so they'd need to scale up and most favicons wouldn't be able to and look horrible.\nThat said, the link below is to an article describing a multistep way of doing it, if you want to go to the effort (perhaps if you wanted semi-permanent desktop web shortcuts).\nhttp://jafdip.com/index.php/2010/04/28/creating-web-shortcuts-on-the-mac-os-x-desktop/\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Is the i7 2.2GHz MacBook Pro worth the price difference with respect to the 2.0GHz model? I am a software developer and I'm considering getting a 15\" MBP as my development machine.\nI would mostly use that laptop to code with Java and I probably won't be playing much on it, so having the 6750M video card is not that relevant (although it would be nice to have, of course).\nWould you still consider the 2.2GHz model just for the CPU speed or it is not worth the difference price by itself?\n\nA: I bought a new 15'' MBP just one week ago and I considered the same choices. Finally I took the 2.0 GHz for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*from the pure CPU point of view this would be an endless pursuit: there will always be a CPU with a frequency a bit higher than what you have; for example you would be tempted to go from the 2.2 to the 2.3 GHz\n\n\n*\n\n*the 2.2 (and 2.3) have 8 MB (instead of 6 MB) of L3 cache, that's my only regret\n\n*I think it is more useful to upgrade from the 5400 RPM drive to the 7200 RPM, I think there's a noticeable difference\n\n*if you're a software developer then you should really consider to upgrade to the HD screen\nIn my opinion, unless your budget is unlimited these two upgrades are much worth their price than the CPU upgrade to 2.2 GHz (even considering the GPU and the cache).\n\nA: The price for CPU upgrade is better spent for the screen upgrade and a SSD (from 3rd party manufacturer like Intel or OCZ). A SSD upgrade will offer much better performance boost than a CPU upgrade. \nOther note: both the 2.0Ghz and 2.2Ghz have 6MB L3 cache. Only the 2.3Ghz CPU (i7-2820QM) has 8MB cache. The difference between 2.0Ghz and 2.2, 2.3Ghz version is that the 2.0Ghz (i7-2635QM) doesn't support AES-NI and Vt-d.\n\nA: I'm also a software developer and I was considering the same choices.  I went for the 2.2 Ghz CPU, simply because I can always upgrade to a SSD drive or get more RAM in the future, but you can't really upgrade the CPU.\nI wouldn't really say looking for more CPU power is an endless pursuit - as a software developer you're pretty much always using all the power your machine can give you, so I took more a long-term view.\n", "Q: Copy, Paste, Cut, Select-All Keyboard Shortcuts I recently bought am older Mac (Mac G5 with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger). I have a PC keyboard and when I tried the keyboard shortcuts for text editing such as copy, paste, cut, select-all I realized they don't work.\nI researched the web for some help and found that the Mac keys are not in the same place as Windows keys. Most probable alt acts as control because that's where the command key on a Mac keyboard is placed or sometimes Windows key. None of the combinations seem to work.\nThe control key works on the Mac because I can switch between FireFox tabs by pressing control + tab, control + shift + tab or I can use control + Z and control + Y.\nDo you have any ideas why this is not working and how I can fix it?\n\nA: Almost all of the keyboard shortcuts you've learned on Windows are the same on the Mac. The difference is which modifier key you use to invoke them.\nOn Windows, shortcuts are typically invoked with the Ctrl modifier key.\nOn the Mac, you use the  key, also known as the \"command\" key. It's in the same physical position as the Alt key on a Windows keyboard, but is nothing like the Alt key.\nThe Mac has its own Alt key, labeled Opt/Alt. Its primary use is a secondary modifier for keystrokes. Command-Option-S might be \"Save As\", for example, while Command-S is regular \"Save\".\nThe Ctrl key is there on a Mac keyboard, too, but it's hardly ever used for anything.\n\nThe relative layouts look something like this:\n     PC:     Ctrl Windows Alt\n     Mac:   Ctrl Opt/Alt \n\nThe problem is that you're most likely using a PC keyboard on your Mac. In that specific case, the Opt/Alt and  keys are reversed. You can change this in System Preferences, under Keyboard. Truly a huge pain in the rear for switchers. That layout looks like this, instead:\n     PC keyboard on Mac:   Ctrl  Opt/Alt \n\nApple's website has some pretty good hints and tips for Windows switchers.

However, on my new MBP, I decided to get the 8 GB from Apple.\nI'd go with the Crucial if you want good quality and great value.\nHere is a video showing installation\nhttp://www.ramfor.com/ram-memory/apple-macbook-pro-early-2011-crucial-memory-upgrade/\n", "Q: How to display/alter a jailbroken iOS device's route table? I jailbroke my iPhone4 and want to display and alter the route table on my iPhone. There is a route command, but I don't know the parameters needs to display/alter the route table.\nI've googled a lot but still cannot find a clue. I know how to display/alter route table in Linux, but obviously the route command in iOS is not like the same command in Linux.

Some of them are single-page, others are multi-pages.  \nAs of today, I'm using Image Capture for this purpose but I don't find it to be handy to treat a lot of documents.\nThe main issue is that I will for example scan 10 pages, being one 3 pages document, one 4 pages document and three 1 page document.\nI currently have to scan all pages which will end up as images or pdf on my desktop and I then have to combine them to produce multi-pages PDFs.  \nIs there a tool which will help me achieve all of this more quickly and easily? \n\nA: Two answers:\n1) By far the easiest/best document scanner for Macs is the Fujitsu ScanSnap series. You just insert a stack of papers, press a button, and out pops a PDF. It scans both sides of each page in a single pass.\n2) To convert a scanned PDF to something searchable, by far the most reliable OCR program available (for any platform, Mac included) is the AABYY FineReader package. It is miles ahead of any other package- especially Adobe Acrobat's built-in OCR which is barely usable. This comes bundled, at no additional cost, with the ScanSnap, or you can buy it separately.\nI've used one of these for several years... have scanned all of my old bills, receipts, documents, etc. so whenever I need to find something I just use spotlight and can find it in seconds.\n\nA: I have a scanner from Brother too. The software that came alongwith it indeed supports only the most basic functions (i.e., scan and store page(s) as PDF on your machine).\nTo split, merge, delete, encrypt and more, I use the command-line utility called pdftk (http://fredericiana.com/2010/03/01/pdftk-1-41-for-mac-os-x-10-6/).\nIt's free and can handle many complex manipulations charmingly. Look here for examples: http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-cli-examples/.\n\nA: Are you looking for software-only solutions or are you also open to hardware options?\nAfter experimenting with a few, I find Fujitsu's ScanSnap series to be ideal for this sort of thing. Its form factor makes it easy to load in sets of documents up to A4, and easily turn on/off duplex/double-sided scanning. Its output to Evernote also helps in my workflow. It also comes with some software for PC and Mac that will let you do what you described, and also adds text recognition as well to it.\n\nA: Hamrick VueScan is excellent for this. I do this kind of scanning a lot, and this is the tool that I choose.\n\nA: In my personal experience, Scansnap plus Devonthink is the best and also expensive.\n\nA: I use GraphicConverter for scanning to pdf. You can combine the individual pages using pdftk, as suggested by @Rahul, or you can use an Automator script as explained in this question.\n\nA: Canon has a Software called \"Canoscan\". It is not the nicest looking peace of Desktop Software, but it has all you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scan PDFs\n\n*Append another scan to the current PDF\n\n*Start a new PDF\n\n\nA: The easiest way I have found to scan lots of documents is to fax them to myself using Maxemail.com's fax to PDF service.  \nPut the documents in the fax machine--as many pages as it will handle, press redial, ad a few minutes later you get an email with your documents in PDF format. \nThey are, of course, black and white image files and they have fax headers on them, but the image quality is very good and it is much faster than putting documents one at a time on a scanner. \n\nA: I always use the excellent PDFsam software for these kind of tasks: if you want an Open Source solution, I personally think that it's the best you can get for such tasks. \nLook for the Alternate Mix feature, which you can use to \"emulate\" front-back scanning with a single-side home scanner such as the one I have: you can also read this post for a guide explaining how to use it.\n\nA: I have used every version of PaperPort that has ever been released and find that I'm dead in the water without it. In addition to using it as my scan software, I can convert files, edit JPEGS and PDFs, enhance documents, cut or copy and paste, stack and unstack PDFs, add annotations such as text and highlights, email, etc. Umfortunately, Nuance does not have a version for Macs.\n", "Q: iPhone won't connect to wifi My iPhone will not connect to my wireless router, even when I put the password in.\nHow do I troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: Checking the obvious - you can connect to WiFi on another computer right? The iPhone frequently over-reports the strength of the WiFi connection, so you can see 2 or 3 bars but not actually connect because it times out.\nTry holding the iPhone vertically with your fingers at the top and bottom - the WiFi receiver is in the side, so when you hold it with your hands at the sides, it reduces WiFi reception.\n\nA: I recently solved this problem. Several mobile devices (including the iPhone) just simply won't connect to a network that is broadcasting WPA/WPA2 simultaneously. You have to choose either WPA or WPA2 and then they will connect no problem.\n", "Q: show current playing song (dj, genius, playlist etc) in library When I hear a song playing in iTunes DJ or some other kind of playlist, I'd sometimes like to see which album it is from or even see which other albums I have by that particular artist.\nHow can I do this?\nThe only option it gives is 'show in finder'\nEDIT:\nMeaning to navigate directly to the track in the main music library\nEDIT:\nnot sure how I really clarify this much more but here goes:\nWhen I see a file that is playing as part of a playlist, I often want some kind of 'show in library' function.

Why hasn't the XNU kernel been extensively used despite the open source licence offered by Apple?\nIs it because of  specific licensing issues? Or because Linux is technologically  much better for reuse ? Or is it a market with one winner, Linux?\n\nA: On one hand, Linux had a considerable head start on XNU, having been first released in 1991. While I can't seem to find information on a release date for XNU, I'm quite sure it happened after Apple acquired NeXT, in 1997.\nAlso, the kernel design used in XNU may not be easy for some developers to get their head around. Linux is a monolithic kernel, while XNU is a hybrid (a cross between monolithic and micro kernel models) It's possible that developers are more comfortable developing for the former model than the latter. Ken Thompson, one of the fathers of UNIX, also argued this point.\nMore information can be found on Wikipedia (starting at Kernel)\n\nA: As noted by OpenStep developers:\n\nApple has been making available certain drivers in binary form under the Apple Binary License. Without these, Darwin in its current form would not be usable (in fact, not even the XNU kernel could boot). \n\n", "Q: Installing cURL from Macports fails I'm trying to install libusb-devel using Macports on a friend's Mac (we need it in order to install Osceleton). On my computer, the installation went perfectly well, but I'm stuck while installing it on his.\nOne of the dependencies of libusb-devel is curl. However, installing curl seems to fail. During the configuration of curl, an error message is shown and the installation quits.

He's running Mac OS X 10.6.6.\n\nA: The issue is that you are trying to compile for the ppc architecture thus the error in cross-compiling.\nDid you upgrade to Snow Leopard leaving macports on - the only way to upgrade macports across operating systems is to reinstall.\nOtherwise did you choose the correct dmg to install from - it is OS dependant.\nOtherwise you need to look at /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and see what build_arch is set to. The default (or not set) on a new Snow Leopard macports install is 32 or 64 bit Intel code depending on the CPU you have.\n", "Q: How can I \"say\" to another Mac? I have two Macs in our house (iMac and MacBook Pro).\nI would like to use the say command-line utility to type something on my MBP and have it speak on the iMac, rather like an intercom system.\nPlus, it could be hilarious to send messages to my wife while she is using the iMac.\nCan this be done?\n\nA: Since the two Mac are in the same house, I assume they're both on the same network.\nFirst of all, you need to activate Remote Login on the Mac where you want the sound out.\nGo to System Preferences > Sharing and check the Remote Login checkbox.\nThen, using your computer, open Terminal and type this\nssh <user>@<computer name.local>\n\nWhere <user> is your wife login and <computer name> is the name of the other computer.\nNow, it's as if you're having Terminal open on your wife's computer and you can say whatever you like.\n\nA: In addition to using ssh to run commands on the remote host, you can use Remote Apple Events, which also have a say command, as well as others that may be useful to you, like display alert.\nOn the target machine, enable:\n\nSystem Preferences > Sharing > Remote Apple Events\n\nThen from your machine run the following script (in AppleScript Editor, or via osascript in Terminal):\ntell application \"Finder\" of machine \"eppc://machine-name.local\"\n    say \"Hello\"\nend tell\n\nIt will ask you to authenticate when you compile or run this. If you do so in AppleScript Editor, it will remember the authentication as long as you leave AppleScript Editor open, so you won't have to authenticate each time you run this. (The authentication dialog also has an option to save your credentials on the Keychain to avoid being repeatedly pestered.)\nYou can do this from the command-line in Terminal with:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" of machine \"eppc://machine-name.local\" to say \"Hello\"'\n\nHow to Display a Message on a Remote Machine\nYou could also display a message by logging into the remote machine with ssh† and running this command in the remote shell (this doesn't make use of Remote Apple Events, just Remote Login for ssh):\nosascript -e 'say \"Hello\" without waiting until completion' -e 'tell application \"System Events\"' -e 'activate' -e 'display alert \"Hello!\"' -e 'end'\n\nThe say command starts the speech asynchronously, then this brings System Events to the front to display the message while the speech is playing.\n† Commands that display UI, like display alert and display dialog, are not allowed via Remote Apple Events. To send them to a process on a remote machine, you must first go through ssh.\n\nA: Alternatively again, nothing stopping you from using Remote Desktop or Screen Sharing, which is built into OSX, and just logging in as a normal user, skipping the terminal.\nThen you can use say normally. Or there are plenty of apps that do text to speech.\n", "Q: What to do when the Videos app freezes I started playing a video added from iTunes and about 10 minutes in the video stopped and the Videos app closed. Whenever I go back to the Videos app, it is a blank dark screen that won't respond to any input. \nI tried doing a \"force close\" where I double hit the home button and then hold on a icon until I can press the minus. That didn't work. I restarted the iPad. Still nothing. I changed e settings so it doesn't start from where I left off. Still a dark screen. \nIt's an iPad 2 with whatever is the almost latest version. I'm on the road so I can't plug into my computer and get the latest version of iOS.\n\nA: Since you don't have the ability to perform a full reset (well, you can, but you won't have any personal data on it anymore, including whatever videos you're watching), I have a couple of suggestions.\nFirst is a strange bug that I know has affected some iPad users and so might be an issue for you; it's one of those \"how can these two things possibly be related\" bugs.\nLaunch the Settings app and choose General=>Reset=>Reset Network Settings. All this will really mean is you'll lose your saved WiFi networks. If that doesn't solve it then I'd try the next suggestion (below), and if it doesn't work then in this same area choose Reset All Settings; I suggest trying this one third just because it means all of your apps will lose their stored settings and revert to their defaults, which is a hassle to manually restore.\nSecond, is it possible that your iPad is full or near-full? I've heard of this problem when there's so little space left that the Videos app can't even clear out any caches and so is stuck. \nIf so then you might try deleting a few things that you can get to. For example, delete some files in the iPod app, or delete any particularly large apps that you can live without until you next synch. Large apps include complex games (pretty much anything that renders 3 dimensions like first-person shooter, racing games, etc.) and apps with a lot of documents like iBooks or Pages or what have you. You can also delete photos via the Photos app if you have a bunch of large ones that are stored elsewhere.\nAfter clearing out some space, restart your iPad again.\nIf all three of those fail then you're pretty much stuck with resetting your iPad, but again, that wipes everything and returns the device to its factory settings, which is likely not ideal in your situations since a restore requires your computer.\n", "Q: Scripting environment setup When I start a session programming on my macbook pro, I have a bunch of apps I'd like open and ready:\n\n\n*\n\n*DevNull smtp java server (run from terminal with java -jar DevNull.jar)\n\n*Terminal shell in the tomcat/bin directory with startup.sh;tail -f ../logs/catalina.out running after rm -rf work and test webapp directories\n\n*IntelliJ running\n\n*after tomcat loads (fine with just having a timer), Firefox with my webapp loaded\n\n*after tomcat loads, Chrome with my webapp loaded\n\n*ForkLift\n\n*TextMate\n\n*Couple of Finder windows open in particular directories\n\n\nThose are pretty core...  then it depends on what exactly I'm working on as far as other apps I need open.\nSo how do I write a script I can double click on and have all the above ready for me, saving me a couple minutes each day and being a little less annoying getting started?  Is there a nice app that can easily do the above for me?  Do I need to write a bash or python script for this? Or learn applescript?\n\nA: I'd use a bash script for this as everything that you list can be opened in bash.  Use the open command pointing to the application to run the application or a folder location to open a particular folder with finder.\n\nA: I use Concentrate to load up apps relevant to whatever I'm doing right now - you can run terminal commands, Applescripts, load programs, etc. I hit 'concentrate', make some tea, and then return to everything running. I know I could do this with Automator, but I'm too lazy to learn how.\n", "Q: Time Capsule - Home made - OpenWrt router with usb disk acting as airport wireless device I want to remove the need of connecting my Time Machine USB disk directly to my MacBook. I don't need any other functionality which Apple Time Capsule offers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to use my router with a connected USB disk (already working with Time Machine) and installed OpenWRT as network Time Capsule? \n\n*Can I use a Samba share as Time Capsule disk?\n\nA: HFS+ will get you nowhere since Linux cannot write it reliably. I don't know how to configure your OpenWRT hardware exactly but here is my solution used on both x86 Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi (I think the latter is close enough to an router - at least a smartphone)\n\n\n*\n\n*You need some packages to make AFP and mDNS/DNS-SD work:\napt-get install avahi-daemon netatalk\n\n\n*Now configure your netatalk to share the volume on your Linux box. The filesystem does not make any difference, I used ext4 as it is close enough to modern HFS+ systems. (On my RPi, the only way to access files on it is to use either SSH or AFP, I uninstalled Samba)\n\n*At this point, you can hack your mac to force it to use your Linux box as Time Capsule, or you can find a real Time Capsule (or OS X Server) and replicate all its extra DNS-SD records using Avahi.\n\nA: To #1, yes you can do that, it doesn't need to be formatted to \"Time Capsule\" format, what you would do is format the drive to HFS+, \"bless\" the drive with your mac then connect it to your openWRT router.\nFor #2, yes you can do that, here is a brief guide on how: http://blog.xemantic.com/2008/04/timemachine-backups-on-smb-share.html\n", "Q: is it possible to connect two external monitors with mini displayport + thunderbolt to displayport or hdmi? I've heard that thunderbolt can be used as a displayport. That make me wonder if I can use two external monitors with mini displayport and thunderbolt to displayport or hdmi.\nIs it possible??\n\nA: The thunderbolt port and display port are the same port.  So it's not two separate ports.\nThat said, due to the high bandwidth nature of thunderbolt, I suspect we will be able to daisy chain monitors in the future, as well as having thunderbolt \"hubs\" where multiple devices can be plugged in.\nBut for now, it's one port.  So only one external monitor.  \n\nA: Thunderbolt can daisy-chain monitors, however the limits of the original system still apply. Mac systems with integrated graphics e.g. Intel HD 3000 can only run one external display. Those with dedicated 3D e.g. 15\" Macbook Pro can run a couple of external Thunderbolt displays.\n", "Q: verizon iphone4: if it has access to wifi and 3G which will it use and what's best for battery life At home, my iphone has a strong signal to Verizon's 3G network and my home WiFi network.  In the interest of battery life, which connection will iphone use if it has access to both networks?  Also, given strong connections to both networks, what's the best way to optimize for battery life?\n\nA: iPhones will always use a wireless connection if one is available (and it is authorised to use it).  It will then use 3G (EV-DO).  And then 1xRTT as a last resort.  So it always prioritises wireless if available.\nWireless is generally better on battery life too.\n", "Q: What am I going to do with an iMac 27 inch's display 3, 4 years from now? I want to buy a 27 inch iMac, but the monitor cannot be re-used... it cannot be hooked up to any KVM (Keyboard / Video / Mouse) switch to be used with a PC too...\nAlso, 3, 4 years down the road, I know the iMac will become slow and probably need to buy another computer.  At that time, what am I going to do with the monitor?  Apple is saying they save the \"microwatt\" between your typing, but what about wasting a good monitor like that?\n\nA: Sell it. Used Macs hold their resale value better, in my experience, than used PCs do. (Also, keep the original box & other packaging - that will help the resale value.)\n\nA: The display port on the latest iMac's (actually since late 2009) acts as both an output (for an external display) or an input (to make the imac screen a monitor).\nSee http://smokingapples.com/asides/new-27-imac-doubles-up-as-external-monitor/\n", "Q: Should I disconnect my MacBook Pro's power cord when the battery is fully charged? My friend told me that I need to disconnect the power cord when the battery is fully charged. Otherwise, I will shorten the life of the battery.\nOther people say you should drain it once a month or point out that for long term storage, you should charge it to 50% and then periodically (3 to 6 months) bring it back to 50% and store it again.\nI am going to use my laptop at home 90% of the time. So, I plan to have the power cord connected all the time.\nI'd prefer to just plugging in my MacBook Pro and letting it be on charge long term and occasionally taking it away from the charger when I'm not at home or my desk.\nAre these specific recommendations worth the inconvenience?\n\nA: No. The nature of the lithium battery chemistry does not require periodic cycling to maintain capacity.\nFurthermore, the periodic cycling described in the apple documents listed above (@I-M-JM's Post) does not have an effect on the battery chemistry. It only serves to allow the battery capacity meter to accurately track the battery capacity.\n\nPeriodically draining the battery only serves to allow the Battery metering systems to accurately estimate the remaining battery capacity. It is not needed to maintain the battery itself, and actually wastes a battery cycle.\nBasically, if you don't run your battery down for a long time, the next time you disconnect the laptop from AC, the estimated time remaining value will be incorrect. However, the actual battery capacity and runtime will be unchanged from normal.\nThe statement \"For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally.\" from Apple's site is actually incorrect regarding the lithium battery chemistry at worst, and an oversimplification at best.\n\nFurthermore, The battery metering and battery charging systems are separate, so inaccuracies in the battery metering system will not cause errors in charging the battery (before you ask). Lithium cells are actually quite simple to charge.\nRef:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery\nhttp://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/lithium_based_batteries\nhttp://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries\n\nA: Don't worry about it and just use your MacBook Pros for what you bought them for.\nWhy?\nPhysics.  No matter what you do, you can't change the laws of physics and lithium batteries are governed by age and the number of charge cycles.  A complete discharge and recharge is one cycle.  A 20% discharge 5 times over is one cycle, a 5% discharge 20 types is also one cycle.\nWhether that cycle takes a half day, a full day or a week all depends on how you use it; but I am guessing you didn't buy a MBP to sit on a shelf all day long doing nothing.\nEven when you keep your MBP plugged in, you are reducing the per day cycle count; however you are not eliminating it.  But the bigger question is, did you buy a MBP to sit at a desk all day?  If so, you should have bought an iMac instead - there's no battery so you eliminate this problem altogether.\nThat said, there are things you can avoid that will shorten the life of your battery and those things include:\n\n*\n\n*Extreme temperatures - high heat and freezing temps can kill a battery prematurely.\n\n\n*Drops and physical stress can damage the battery shortening its life\n\n\n*Not using the right charger can harm your battery.  Always use a GENUINE power adapter, not some discount charger you find on eBay.\nWhen they do die, it's always best to get a good quality replacement battery from a reputable manufacturer.  The 2006 MBP uses an external battery so it's fairly easy to find replacements - and some even come with generous warranties.\nThe 2013 MBP Retina (and newer) batteries require the back cover to be removed, but are actually pretty easy to replace even though they may be glued to the top cover.  You can find many good replacements now on the aftermarket, with generous warranties as well.\nWhen you get down to it, the battery prices are not that all off putting.\nThe bottom line is that your batteries have a life span that's governed by age and use and there is nothing you can do short of not using your MacBook to change that. That, however kind of defeats the purpose of having the MacBook in the first place.\n\nA: I would suggest that you read following 2 articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\nFrom my personal experience, don't charge fully, and you can disconnect it after you charge till 90% or more.\n\nA: From Apple's Notebook battery site (emphasis mine):\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing.\n\n\nA: I use Watts which tells me the current state of my battery (in terms of total capacity) and has a regular calibration process to improve its lifetime. It costs $6.95.\n\nA: You do not need to disconnect your MacBook Pro's battery. Your battery will stop charging once it is full. Apple's modern batteries are much smarter than previous designs.\nTo get the most out of your MacBook Pro's battery, follow the Notebook Battery advice from Apple: unplug and use your battery until empty about once a month, then charge back up to full.\nAt the time of answering, Apple's advice read:\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing.\n\nIf you need help following Apple's advice, use Battery Guardian; it is free and will remind you when to deplete your battery.\n\n\nA: I keep my macbook pro plugged in all the time with no adverse effects.  And if you want to use your mac laptop in clam-shell mode (ie lid closed, connected to an external monitor), then you will need the power supply plugged in anyway.\nStill, I (and Apple) recommend to unplug it every month or so and use the battery a bit, just to remind it that its a battery ;)  Keeps it healthy.\n\nA: As Per My Personal Experience I've used my 2012 Macbook pro and Also Sony Vaio etc Replace Vaio's Battery 4 times \nOverall i Released whether you keep it Plugged in or use it \nIts gonna hold less charge after 3-4 Years no matter what\nso stop thinking about it its just normal whatever you do it may have less charge cycles but the capacity will decrease \nLets take an example of an ideal situation where you bought a new macbook and used it for 10 years constantly plugged in with just 1 charge cycle , how many hours of battery backup you'll expect out of that 10 years old macbook.\n\nA: For those who use their MacBooks as a desktop replacement like me, apps like Energiza Pro might be an option to not charge the batteries to 100% all the time. In this case, Apples \"Optimize Battery Charging\" which keeps the battery at 80% and charges up to 100% when you actually need it, usually does not work. Instead, you can limit charging to e.g. 80% and manually charge to 100% in case you need the full capacity.\nDisclaimer: I'm the author of the app!\n\n\nA: I'm adding my personal experience here that I recently had with my MacBook Pro 2015 15\" (maxed out options).  \nI've always kept it on the charger because I always use it docked-in both at home and at the office.  Per my system information, I have only 198 cycles on the battery (again, original battery since 2015). \nLast week my case had swollen up completely... turns out all the lithium cells became defective.  I took it to Apple and they pretty much said that I'm responsible for the battery going bad and that I had to pay for the parts and replacement.\ntl;dr: 2015 MBP has less than 200 cycles as I always kept it on the power cable, but that per-apple damaged the batteries and I'm now responsible to cover all costs to repair.\n\nA: Get authoritative information whether your battery is fully charged or is it still charging by following these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to About this Mac\n\n*Click on System Reports\n\n*Click on Power. Observe \"Charge Information\"\n\n\nA: I have the dell laptop, what I did is alway pluged it into the power, what I end up with is an battery that last no more than 5 minutes without power plugged in\nSo I think you should never charging and working at the same time\n", "Q: Black screen when installing Boot Camp? I recently did a complete wipe of my late 2009 MBP and restore using a Time Machine backup, so I would have uninterupted space at the end of the drive for creating a Boot Camp partition. The Boot Camp tool runs fine now, so I insert my Windows 7 DVD when it tells me to, reboot the computer, it appears to start running off the DVD… but then I just see a black, blank screen. I left it in that condition for over half an hour with no changes. There shouldn't be anything else weird with my system.\nHas anyone else experienced this? Apple's website has a downloadable fix for an iMac attempting to install Windows 7, with the same symptoms. I tried that fix even though I have a different Mac, but it didn't work either. Help?\n\nA: Yep, this is something that can happen, and there are two Apple articles to address it.\nBoot Camp: iMac displays a black screen during installation of Windows 7\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS3173\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the autounattend.xml and updated graphics drivers \n\n\nBoot Camp: Start up to black screen after installing Windows\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS2600\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n\nYou mentioned that you did already download a fix from Apple, so I am assuming you may have followed the first article already, and if that is the case there are some instructions floating around the net to try to resolve the graphics issues by removing an ATI driver pre-reboot. \n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Boot Camp Assistant in OS X as normal and create a partition when asked, then insert your Windows 7 disc to reboot and begin the process proper.\n\n*Windows 7 requires the NTFS file system, so once in the installer just select your new partition (labelled BOOTCAMP), click on Drive options (Advanced) and choose to format it. Then select the newly formatted partition and continue.\n\n*Windows 7 will begin installing, and once it gets almost to the bottom of its checklist, it’ll try to reboot. Now, if you leave it here, you’ll get so far and see the black screen. Any further attempts to reboot will bring you to the same dead end.\n\n*Instead, restart and press a key to boot from the Windows 7 disc when prompted. Rather than running the installation again, choose the little option at the bottom to Repair your computer. Decline any suggestions that pop up until you see a list of options with Command Prompt at the bottom. Choose that option.\n\n*At the Command Prompt, type DEL C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERS\\ATIKMDAG.SYS to delete the default ATI driver, then close the window and reboot.\n\n*This time, Windows should successfully initialise a more appropriate display driver, allowing you into the desktop.

I must've spaced out and accidentally pressed something, but what might that something be?\n\n\nA: Select All and Delete would have been done the trick :)  You've deleted the screenshot (which was in the background) but kept the annotations.\n", "Q: Do I need to open port 5223 for iPhone push notifications to work when on wifi? iPhone 4, iOS 4.3.1\nPush notifications are working, when WiFi is turned off and device uses 3G, but when WiFi is on I can't receive any notifications.\nI was told that something can block port 5223 that push notifications, so I've turned of firewall on my Linksys router. Still don't work.\nFor some games I used to forward port for IP address, the pattern in router configuration is as follows:\napp_name, port_range_start, port_range_stop, TCP/UDP, IP\nBut when I list my DHCP clients in router admin page it seems that iPhone has no IP.\nSo what to do nex\n\nA: You don't need to open any ports on your firewalls for push notifications to work on your iPhone.\nMy iOS devices spent 90% of the time behind firewalls that don't allow any inbound connections to them. Notifications work fine (even with mobile data turned off).\nThe Apple docs at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3576 do talk about port 5223. But they will be referring to out going connections on that port (even though they don't explicitly state that). Your firewall is unlikely to be blocking those, though I guess it is worth checking. I guess it is also possible that your ISP is blocking the out going port, but again that seems unlikely.\nDespite the \"push\" in its name, Push Notifications are actually more accurately \"pull\" notifications (like most things with \"push\" in their name). The iOS device connects to Apple on port 5223 to listen in for the notifications.\n\nA: You probably need to refresh the DHCP list.  A lot of routers only update this list occasionally; my router, for instance, still doesn't list the netbook I authenticated to the wireless over a month ago.  Try resetting the router, or if you don't want to do that get your iphone's IP from the network setup on the phone itself and forward the port to your iphone by IP instead of device name.\n", "Q: Apple Mac OS X Lion: the cost and release date At which date will MAC OS X Lion be released?\nAnd if I have Mac OS X Snow Leopard, can I upgrade to Lion for free?\n\nA: There's no way to know that right now. Apple does not disclose such information.\nWait for Apple's June event where they might specify the launch date.\nOne thing is for sure, you'll have to pay for it, there won't be a free migration path from Snow Leopard, unless you bought a Mac computer the week before Lion's release.\n\nA: Release date and pricing have not been released.\nSince Snow Leopard was only $30, it's virtually guaranteed it will not be free.\n\nA: I believe the 'release date' is this (northern hemisphere) summer. I very much doubt you'll be able to upgrade to Lion for free. Snow Leopard cost US$29. Officially this was for upgrades only, at least initially, but the DVD could be used to do fresh installs too.\nWith Lion appearing to be more about adding features to the OS, rather than a code clean-up, I suspect this version will cost US$129. This is pure speculation at this stage mind you.\n", "Q: iPhone Safari: Clearing the cache does not seem to be enough I'm developing a mobile website and am using an iPhone for testing it. One of the .jpgs used was faulty and displayed as a black rectangle in the iPhone's Safari browser. The code was then changed and there is now a .png image instead.\nFor some reason even after clearing Safaris cache that image is still black, and I need a new phone that has never visited the website before in order to display it correctly. \nWhy is that happening and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Sounds like an iPhone bug/feature where it will cache some images (and not clear them properly).\nThe fix seems to be to put a random number in a query string after the images on your site.\neg  picture1.png?2011242424\nSome web frameworks will do this automatically (eg rails). Otherwise you could do this on just the affected image and see if it fixes it.\n\nA: You can try browsing to the image itself, refreshing that page - that usually clears the cache for the image.\nHowever best practice in web development is to follow @RobZolkos 's advice about putting a number string after the image src. When you change the image, you change the number, which forces it to load again. A little off topic, but check out HTML5 Boilerplate's cachebusting which does this for you automatically in the build script.\n", "Q: How can I use the dvdbackup tool in Mac OS X? I want to use 'dvdbackup' tool in my Mac OS X, however its specification is too simple. I would like to know how to back up my whole DVD, can anyone give my some example or advice step by step?\n\nA: From the man page:\ndvdbackup -M -i/dev/dvd -o/my/dvd/backup/dir/ This action creates a valid DVD-Video structure that can be burned to a DVD-/+R(W) with help of mkisofs version 1.11a27 or later  http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/dvdbackup\nHonestly I have never used this tool on Mac OS X, if you want to do some dvd ripping and this keeps frustrating you, Handbrake is pretty good, or you can even use the built in Disk Utility to do a image backup of said DVD.\n", "Q: What is the best way to use Gtalk on iphone? What is the best way to use Gtalk on iphone?\n\nA: Since Google does a pretty good job of making their websites mobile-friendly, navigating to http://talkgadget.google.com/ and logging in should present you with a nice chatting interface.\nOn the iOS app side, imo seems to be a popular choice, though I can't personally vouch for it (the mobile web interface works fine for me when I'm away from a real computer)\n\nA: For an app that can not only handle the IM features of Gtalk, but also the voice features, check out Talkatone.\nOtherwise, there's too many iOS apps to list that can interface with Gtalk via their XMPP protocol, as well as accessing Google's web app via Mobile Safari.\n\nA: I like to use an app called eBuddy http://www.ebuddy.com/ that I use for a Gtalk chat client. It also lets you use other chat clients like AIM and msn. There are many different apps out there that I am sure do the same thing but I really like eBuddy. \n", "Q: How can I block specific telephone numbers on my iPhone 4? How can I block specific telephone numbers on my iPhone? I don't want to get call from specific numbers. if anyone call to me from the blocked number, he should receive a message that \"this number does not exist\" or \"this number is busy\" always.\n\nA: If you want to block a specific number where they are given a msg, \"Not Available, Blocked, etc\" it is free, you DONT have to have any 'reason' except that you want them blocked. Any phone co. will do it (I'm 100% sure Verizon allows FREE blocking of up to 5 lines) I simply called Verizon n said block this #, they did, it expires after 3 months automatically, but you can simply renew it.\nI'de LOVE to have an app that could simple send specific numbers straight to Vm (like iBlacklist) without jail breaking my iPhone ;(\n\nA: Pay $20 and port your phone number to Google Voice.  Then Google can ignore calls from specific numbers.\n\nA: There are applications that do this if you have jailbroken your iPhone.  Without jailbreaking however there isn't a way to block a single or specific incoming number.  I've known people that have requested their provider to block a certain number and without a very good (usually legal) reason, they won't do it.\nThe best thing you can do is record 30 seconds of silence in garage band and then use that as a ringtone for that specific number.  Then at least the phone won't alert you.\n\nA: Why don't you record your own message and have that respond to unwanted calls. Could be fun eg :  \"All calls from this number are traced by the authorities as part of an ongoing investigation.\"  or  \"Calls from your number are subject to $100 per minute surcharge. You have 5 seconds to hang up before charges commence.\" \n\nA: The only thing you can do is call your provider and ask them to block the number for you. \nThere may be apps available in the app store that can do this though.\n", "Q: Split a single page PDF into multiple pages Is there an easy way (in Preview or whatever) to scale up and split a PDF file with a single page into multiple pages? What I would like is to split say an A3 paper document into two A4 pages, to print separately and then put together with tape.\nHow can I do such a thing in OS X?\n\nA: After googling, I found that \"Preview.app\" and \"Automator.app\" can handle this job.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the pdf file in Preview.app\n\n*Show Thumbnail\n\n*Select all pages\n\n*From Menu, choose \"Tools\" - \"Select Tool\"\n\n*Select right side of a page to crop\n\n*From Menu, choose \"Tools\" - \"Show Inspector\"\n7, On the \"Inspector\" window, choose \"Crop and rotate inspector\"\n\n*Push \"Crop\" button (in \"Selected Pages\" group)\n\n*From Menu, choose \"File\" - \"Print\", and choose \"PDF\" - \"Save as PDF...\", and save as \"right.pdf\"\n\n*Do same thing(4-7) for left side and save as \"leftside.pdf\" \n\n*Start Automator.app and make workflow with following actions.\na. \"Get Specified Finder Items\" (choose \"leftside.pdf\" and \"rightside.pdf\")\nb. \"Combine PDF Pages\"\nc. \"Move Finder Items\"\n\n*Run the Automator workflow.\n\n\nA: A small JAVA program called Briss will do exactly this job.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/briss/?source=typ_redirect\n\nA: Preview cannot do this unfortunately, but an $5 application called Tiler does this with ease.\nhttp://www.mindcad.com/tiler.html\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I've made an open source and cross platform command line tool called pdftilecut which does exactly what the OP wants. It works with multi-page document of various sizes.\n\nA: Adobe Reader can do this, too: It includes a Poster Print option in its custom print dialog. \nIt’s the first time I missed a feature from Preview (or the native OS X print dialog) that Adobe Reader has. \nAdobe Reader is free (as in beer) software, it used to be called Acrobat Reader. (Do not confuse it with full-blown Acrobat or any other expensive Adobe product, which can probably do that, too.)\n\nA: If you in Preview select the half of the A3 (e.g. use the Inspector ⌘+I so you get the exact size) - then choose Copy ⌘+C, and paste it as a new file ⌘+N (my suggestion would be to save each new file as its page number). After that do the same with the other half of the A3.\nIf you save every new file as its page number, then afterward you can select all the new files in Finder. Once they're all selected, right click and choose Quick Actions > Create PDF (available in macOS Mojave). You'll have a new PDF that is composed of every pdf you had selected.\n\n\nA: See pdfposter (you can install it with macports):\nhttp://kernel-panik.blogspot.fr/2011/09/printing-god-damin-a0-poster-as-set-of.html\n\nA: I have been searching for a free solution for this and I stumbled a java app called 'briss' which does what it promised perfectly. \nhttp://briss.sourceforge.net\n\nA: If you have Illustrator you can simply create a document with several letter size artboards and place the PDF.\n\nA: Select option to print -> Poster \nThis will split your page into your default page size(for letter size 8 x 11)\nyou can select tile scale to zoom within this split page. You can also select overlap. You can select labels so you know which page goes where.\n\nA: This is an online  tool I found that worked for splitting an A0 format to multiple A4. https://online2pdf.com/split-page-into-4-parts#\n\nA: You print to PDF with the following setting:\n- change page setup to A4 size (if the original document was in A3)\n- then print..\nfor the other side of page, you need to rotate the original file and do the same as above..\n", "Q: Can volume automatically decrease during communication activity? A feature of Windows 7 that I really like that it can decrease the volume of system sounds/music by 50%/80%/mute entirely when it senses communication activity, ie. Skype call, Google Voice call, etc.\nIs it possible to do this in OS X either out of the box or with a third party app?\n\nA: Skype has a preference called \"Pause iTunes during calls\", enabled by default. In \"Telephone\" it's called \"Pause iTunes during call\" and iChat pauses iTunes automatically, without any preference. There is no system-wide setting however, but there are not many phone apps remaining than those as well.\n", "Q: Can using a non Apple USB cable damage an iPhone? If I use a generic/aftermarket iPhone USB cable instead of the official Apple product, can it damage the iPhone?  A vendor at the mall said that high quality iPhone USB cables have a chip that regulates the charging current so it won't damage the device.  He said the cheaper cables don't have that capability. Doesn't sound very credible, so I wanted to double check.\n\nA: They are generally safe to use.  And they don't have a chip (at least the ones I've used).\nThe charger itself may regulate the current, but the cable itself doesn't.  I've used a multitude of cables from a multitude of vendors over the years and I've never had a problem with damaging devices.   Build quality is a different matter.  Too cheap, and the cables inside can break.   Rare but does/can happen.\n\nA: the vendor is trying to upsell you to the expensive brand\nas Rob says above the charger may make some difference (unlikely) but the cable wont \nthere absolutely is no \"chip\" in a 30pin apple ipod cable\n\nA: There is no evidence that shows unofficial cables will damage your iOS devices. However, as a recommendation, choose the official cables rather than the unofficial ones, since the quality is often better with original label.\n\nA: Apple's sync cables are junk, and can break \"at the ankle\" with less than a year of use, exposing wire, shocking you and shorting your device. Some third party cables are worse. Some are far better: I just picked up today the most awesome sync cable I've ever seen... from a BP Gas Station for $12\n\n\nA: Yes and no. \nIf you get an apple certified charger, it will most probably only damage your battery as much as the apple charger, if not less. \nHowever, if you want to buy those cheap or even expensive chargers from a non certified producer, there is no telling what it might do to your phone.\n\nA: Hypothetically the answer is yes - but - for all practical purposes you will never have to worry.  One could somehow \"rig\" up a malicious USB cable that did something funky - but - one you would buy from a 3rd party should never hurt your phone (although the cable might not last too long)\nIf its MFI Certified that means its Non-Apple but Apple approved.  These cablers will be more expensive than the total knock-offs from china.  \n\nA: If you decide to use a third-party cable, I would recommend an Apple MFI certified cable. These will be more expensive than other non-Apple cables, but they have been approved by Apple and should not damage your device.\n\nA: i bought a non apple cheap iphone 5 cable and it has damaged my battery, im losing 30% an hour when my phone is turned on aeroplane mode, i also noticed when my phone was plugged into this cable when i tryed to control my phone the whole screen would shake and crash\n\nA: I vote no on the cheap cord. Went from 24hr battery life to 5.  Forgot to plug it in one night bought a cheap one at the convenience store on the way to work. Charged a quarter of the way and stopped charging. Once home used apple charger ever since but battery life is terrible now. iPhone 5\n", "Q: New MacBook Pro won't wake from sleep without restart My girlfriend's new MacBook Pro will sometimes seem not to wake up from sleep. No amount of spacebar hits, enters, clicks, etc. seem to awake the computer. She's resorted to hard restarting the computer which is obviously not ideal. \nIt seems to happen regardless of its state as it goes to sleep (closed lid, idle). \nAnyone else hear of this or have any ideas?\n\nA: This is a common problem and is caused by the EFI being out of date.

I run commands in terminal a lot and i'm wondering if it is possible to run the commands from spotlight. For example in spotlight  would like to run the command(because i have a lot of network issues): \nping google.com\n\nAnd then spotlight to load terminal and execute the command instead of having to load terminal because it takes so long to load. So is this possible? \n\nA: Not directly but write the commands you want in a shell script and save the script with a .command extension and chmod it so it is executable. This is clickable from Finder and so should work from spotlight\n\nA: It's not possible through Spotlight itself.\nBut it's possible through free applications that can also search files and launch programs, like Spotlight.\nYou have the almighty Quicksilver, that can also make coffee and walk the dog. \nAnd the new player Alfred, which is quite impressive as well.\n\nA: I use both DTerm and Alfred. DTerm is very nice for the occasional quick command or even a man page as its results window expands to fill the screen and scroll if necessary. A simple ESC dismisses the results.\nhttp://decimus.net/DTerm/\n\nA: This is possible with Flashlight (http://flashlight.nateparrott.com/). Flashlight is an unofficial api to spotlight and offers a plugin (http://flashlight.nateparrott.com/plugin/terminal) to run terminal commands right inside spotlight.\n\nA: Just a heads up that Alfred app now has both global hotkeys which allows you to launch apps/commands/applescripts with a key combo, as well as Terminal/Shell integration, which lets you run any Terminal command without launching Terminal.\nFor example, create a script to auto-shorten a URL using goo.gl then copying it to clipboard (here's how you can do that). Or launch any terminal command (e.g. ping yahoo.com) to pop up a Terminal window.\nIt's part of the Powerpack and is in pre-release right now, going to general availability next week :)\nVero (community gal for @alfredapp)\n\nA: You could use Raycast, it's an interface very similar to Spotlight, but it allows you to create and call (even with parameters) your own shell scripts from the search box.

Just wondering are there any apps specifically for AppleTV on Cydia. I have jailbroken my AppleTV 2 and am looking to install XBMC to get 1080p playback, as well as a browser. Are there any other apps out there? Please let me know.  \nThanks!\nThomas\n\nA: Perhaps pedantically, I'd like to point out that while you can play back 1080p video through an Apple TV 2, you will still get 720p output. From the XBMC FAQ:\n\nAt present, though the ATV2 can decode\n  1080p video (using Apple's private\n  VideoToolBox API for\n  hardware-accelerated decoding), it is\n  limited to 720p output. The 1080p\n  video is decoded, then down-scaled in\n  hardware to 720p.\n\nSlightly off-topic, but I find Plex to be a superior Apple TV client to XBMC. I prefer the Plex interface to XBMC. You will, however, need to set up a Plex server, as Plex for iOS is a client that needs to hook up to a server, which does media management and transcoding as needed.\n", "Q: What does Synchronize mean in Mail.app? In Mail.app, what does Synchronize actually do?  How is it different than \"Get New Mail?\"\n\nA: Get Mail will only fetch for new mail in the Inbox.\nSynchronize will look for changes in the IMAP configuration, it will look for changes in the folder structure of your account, and probably a lot more.\nEdit: Synchronize should not be something you do every time you Mail. It's to force Mail to update the conf/folders of you IMAP account. Like if there's a network and it's not syncing anymore. But usually, when moving, deleting, etc. Mail is already taking care of updating where it needs to be updated.\n\nA: Synchronize is also useful to get two (or more) machines back in sync. If I make folder or configuration changes on one Mac, I will run Synchronize on the other Mac to make the second Mac aware of the changes.\nI've also found that Synchronize has solved an occasional problem I've had where a message appears on one machine but not the other.\n\nA: Loic Wolff -- Get Mail will only fetch for new mail in the Inbox.\nNegrino -- I've also found that Synchronize has solved an occasional problem I've had where a message appears on one machine but not the other.\nThis combination of answers is probably the best for explaining why you would care about Get Mail vs Synchronize in Mail.app\nIt comes into play when you've got an IMAP account on your iphone (or other mobile device) and in your Mail.app (as one example).\nIf you skim a few emails on your phone, IMAP will mark them as read, then when you go to your Macbook or Mac that is asleep and has Mail.app running, and you open the lid or take the Mac out of sleep mode and hit Get Mail, it's only going to get \"New\" (unread) messages, not the ones you skimmed on your mobile device.  So this means NOT new to the MAC, new to the IMAP account user.  Your mac was asleep when the mail came in and was marked as read, so it's going to skip those.  So, it'll look like messages are missing.  The quickest way to end this frustration, is if you've let your mac go into sleep mode, do a quick cmd-q and reopen Mail, which will force a sync and get all \"new\" messages including ones you've read on your phone.\nbmike/negrino said all the rest.\n\nA: Mail talks to the mail server to show you messages. Only IMAP accounts can be synchronized as that is a formal way for the server and the mail client on your mac to double check all messages to make sure everything is in sync between the two.\nGet mail focuses on the Inbox and relies on the Mail app having a \"correct\" view matching the data on the mail server. \nSynchronize allows for noise/errors/lost messages, incorrect statuses and other real life bumps and errors. It basically double counts and double checks each and every message to make sure things are 100% correct. Synchronize also checks all folders recursively to get everything accounted for - not just the subset of folders that are marked as having new mail.\nEven more \"deep cleaning\" would be if you told mail to rebuild the account or the mailbox. That means that the local storage that mail uses on your mac has problems getting mail or synchronizing. It's the last step before deleting the account and starting over to download things cleanly from the server.\nIn a nutshell - synchronize should normally do nothing - but it will fill in any gaps as needed. (of course it will get new mail as part of a total synchronization - but it's going to be a lot slower and use more resources on the mac than just asking for new mail) \n\nA: It also comes in handy when using applescript to move mail from one mail box to another or when deleting mail. \nAs an example, if you write an Applescript program to delete the mail in your SPAM folder, that will seem to work fine. On your Mac, the deleted messages no longer appear in the Spam folder, but do appear in the trash folder.\nBut if you run that applescript a second time, it will think that the deleted messages are still in the Spam folder and will process them again. \nThis is because the list of messages in the trash on the server and the list of messages in the trash on the Mac are out of sync. You have to add this \nset allAccounts to every account\nrepeat with theAccount in allAccounts\n    synchronize with theAccount\nend repeat\n\nto the end of your script to get the IMAP server and your Mac back in sync. \n", "Q: OS X Leopard profile hangs on load ON a current project, and really need help.

No matter if it's connected via WiFi or ethernet, it always fails. Even when I boot into Windows 7 there's no luck (so it's not the OS). All the other computers, older MacBooks, and iPod/Phones work great on the network. Take it to a different network and it works flawlessly. \nHas anyone else had this problem? Did you find a way to fix it?\nUpdate: Manually entering a valid IP (copied from another computer that's on the network) gets me a connection. The issue seems to be just in the DHCP.\n\nA: Have you tried to set 'Configure IPv6' to OFF in the Network > Advanced settings for the en0 ?\nI've just had a sim problem as yours (never got an address, other windows machines worked) that was resolved by turning it off. Then my IPv4 address was received.\n\nA: Two shots in the dark here: does the network in question require a DHCP Client ID to be set in Network Preferences? (System Preferences > Network > Advanced > TCP/IP)? Some networks do require that.\nSecond, is the router set to block the MBP's MAC address? That would account for the failure to connect via OS X or Win7. Hard to believe that could be the case, but I suppose it's possible.\n\nA: My issue was fixed by clearing the NVRAM (hold ⌘ Command⌥ OptionPR at boot up untill it chimes twice). I never did try the IPV6 thing so that might work, too.\n\nA: tl;dr Turn off DHCP Reservation on the router/modem in DHCP settings.\nMy kids both got computers from school.  One Macbook Air and one Dell Chomebook.  Neither would get a DHCP address on our home network but worked fine everywhere else.

I recently reinstalled Windows 7 and I just didn't bother about iTunes (anymore).\nNow I luckily found a way to transfer all my apps \"back\" to iTunes (see here), but now when I don't want to keep downloading the updates with my phone, but instead in iTunes, the sync activation leads to one being forced to overwrite the iPhone data. Three questions:\na). Will iTunes be so smart to recognize that the apps are basically identical, or will it just takes ages to stupidly overwrite all the existing apps?\nb). Will this have an effect on the app settings (or e.g. favorites in my dropbox app)?\nc). As I (now) only sync the apps, I assume this won't affect any data or music?!\nThanks for your help in advance!\nKind regards\n\nA: When using the standard iTunes/iPhone sync mechanism:\na) iTunes won't copy over an app to the iphone unless the app in iTunes is newer\nb) It won't have an affect on app settings\nc) If you only sync apps then it won't touch data/music\n\nA: Rob, basically I don't think your a) and b) answers are right.\na). As far as my iTunes Pop-Up says (it's in German), my whole iPhone gets wiped and the stuff replaced.

Then, iTunes usually copies the tracks to iTunes and organizes the folders accordingly.  For some reason, its not working on three albums.  I can't see anything unique about these albums, but iTunes is adding it to my library, and leaving it in the folder.  Then it seems to repeat this process every so often until I have a number of duplicate entries of the same song, all pointing to the same location.  I've got it working properly before and after adding these tracks, just not for these specific 3 albums.  Any thoughts?\nI will post a screenshot as soon as my reputation allows ;)\n\nA: iTunes will put any songs that aren't compatible into a Not Added folder (underneath Automatically Add).  If your music wasn't compatible then you would find them in the Not Added folder.  So it seems that they are compatible, just not getting deleted. \nI would check the permissions on these files and see if iTunes has permission to delete them.  Command-i on the files and folder concerned and ensure your use can read and write them.\nAnother solution is to open the Console.app application (found in the utility folder in Applications) and observe the output of that whilst iTunes is adding the music and see if there are any specific error messages that may point to why it isn't deleting the files.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

It took about an \"hour\" to be activated, but after that, it started working. \nTry using your SIM card on another phone if you have one around or go to an Apple Store and see if you can test the SIM there. \n", "Q: Why is it not possible to use the \"cut\" command to manipulate a file in the Finder? On OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), I don't seem to be able to us the \"Cut\" command on a file in the Finder, like you can do in Windows Explorer on Microsoft Windows. (In Windows, once you select a file and \"cut\" it, you can then move to a different directory and \"paste\" the file to that location.) \nThe only way I can move a file using keyboard or contextual menu commands is to copy the file to another drive or location and then delete the old version of the file. \nIn the Finder's 'Edit' menu, 'Cut' is in the list but if a file itself is selected, it is always greyed out. 'Copy' is not. Why is this?\n\nA: The cut function is implemented in Lion and later as a result of modifying the paste command. If you copy a file and hold down the ⌥ key in addition to the normal paste command.\n⌘+⌥+V = paste + cut in macOS\nThis retroactively cuts the original file(s) and pastes them in the new folder.\nYou can also use: right click + Copy then Option + right click + \"Move Item Here\"\nOn Snow Leopard and earlier, the cut function is not part of Finder.\n\nThe thing that seems to be different is that CUT on OS X means it's gone now. Whereas cut on Windows means text goes away and files get copied for cutting on paste. The implementations seem quite similar for filesystem cut/paste operations in practice.\nAssuming it's not a \"patent thing\", one could speculate that this is a \"do no harm\" design standpoint. Why cut something and then potentially lose or misplace it? Imagine the harm if you selected a few hundred files to copy them (or duplicate them) but inadvertently hit the X key. Instead of forcing you to realize a cat or toddler has cut a whole folder of files, the cut only happens when you paste with the option key held down to paste and then cut in one action.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, there is no cutting of files in Finder. However, if you think you're mind is able to handle such a notion, you can use TotalFinder, which I highly recommend. It also sports tabs, showing hidden files, split views and even has the option to add cut-copy-paste buttons in the context menu.\n\n\nA: There's a cool little plugin now for Finder that adds — among other missing features (enter to open file, folders before files, tabs, etc.) — cut'n'paste functionality like we're used to from any other OS.\nIt's free, actually! I previously used PathFinder which is a paid app, but this time around I really didn't want to install it, as it doesn't integrate very well with OS X (Finder and PathFinder running simultaneously, gesture to reveal desktop giving an empty screen, ...). This one just adds stuff to Finder instead of installing an extra app. You do have to run XtraFinder to configure, though :)\nCheck it out: http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/\n\nA: If you like cut and paste more than drag and drop I'd recommend to install MoveAddict. It brings cut and paste to the Finder, even with toolbar support. I am using MoveAddict for some time now and I am quite happy with it.\n\nA: Keyboard method: Cmd-C then Opt-Cmd-V does the cut&paste for files on Mac. \nMouse method: Drag the file from one folder to the parent of the target folder (ie, if moving to Documents:Financial, drag to Documents). Hover on the parent folder for a few seconds, and it will spring open. Then you can continue dragging the file to the target folder. (note, the mouse method may result in very long hover times, if you're dragging a huge number of files, eg 1,000 files)\nMenu method: It's not part of the Apple menu system to 'cut' files.  The menu Cut option is grayed out, and becomes enabled when text is selected.  But not files. Here is an in-depth discussion on Apple's discussion forum.\n\nA: There is no native way to Cut in Finder.\nIt has always been that way. Why? We don't know.\nI believe the Cut you're talking about is either standard on an Edit but it will most likely become available when you rename a file.\nBottom line is, you can't cut & paste files natively in Mac OS X.\n\nA: Actually, in Lion, cut is now available as part of the Finder. Copy as usual with ⌘+C and (cut-)Paste with ⌘+⌥+V.\n\nA: The lack of a simple and basic function such as cut n paste of folders and files on the same level as Windows is a damning indictment of Apple and makes a mockery of their supposed \"give the people what they want\" culture. It cannot be about resources or expertise because clearly it is trivial to implement. We are left to speculate that this is a misguided and stubborn refusal to compromise or be seen as imitating Windows. It is just daft. There are many good things about Apple products but this approach prevents them from being as good as they could be and is just unnecessary. \n\nA: I believe cut in Finder is for cutting text. I don't believe Apple intended it to be for cutting files in that sense - that is purely a Windows paradigm. If you select a file and press enter, and then select edit -> cut - it should now work and no longer be greyed out. So cut does work. But the connotation of moving files from the windows user experience has apparently caused some confusion. \n\nA: Insofar as files are concerned, \"cut and paste\" is \"move\" by a different name. With Finder, as you have likely noticed, there is a rule behind its behavior during drag-and-drop operations on files:\nif you drag-and-drop to the same volume: move is default.\nif you drag-and-drop to a different volume: copy is default.\nThis is the default behavior. If you want to change the default behavior, here's how to do that:\nholding the command key while dragging changes copy to move.\nholding the option key while dragging changes move to copy.\nI agree with this opinion that this is not intuitive - perhaps even convoluted. But it's been that way for a while now & unlikely to change. The good news is this: If you find it tedious to remember this, one option is to use mv or cp from the CLI.\n\nA: another way is to use XtraFinder, there are many nice features including \"cut\" \n", "Q: No SIM Card installed error in iPhone 3g My iPhone 3G is showing\n\nNo SIM Card installed\n  Insert a valid SIM With no PIN lock to activate iPhone\n\nIt is in Emergency mode so please give me a solution if there is..?\nIt happened when I am tried to update the from iOS 4.1 to 4.2.\n\nA: This is actually a pretty complicated problem with not enough detail to know which one of many things is causing the failure so I'll go over some basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your phone needs to be activated\nthrough iTunes after a restore - so\nsomething in that restore process\ndidn't work.\n\n*The sim and phone have three components - any of which can fail.\n\n*The activation process is complicated and has a lot of checks to be sure the image you are installing is not modified so that the phone will work as designed. This activation needs to connect to the internet so even when everything under your control is correct, it still fails from time to time. Problems on your computer with iTunes or the system itself can cause this to happen on an otherwise working phone.\n\n\nI'm also going to assume the phone is locked to AT&T to keep things simple. If the phone is unlocked legitimately through the carrier and officially recognized by iTunes' activation process this is much more complicated. If it's otherwise modified, the complication is really much more involved so I'll leave those out of the discussion.\nLooking at #1 above - the best advice is to reseat the SIM card and then try again to make sure it wasn't a timing or contact alignment issue. Considering #3 above - it's simplest to take your device to a totally different computer and try the restore there - you can always take it back to your computer to put the backup on it once it's working.\nLet's look at #2 in more depth - sim and phone. A bad sim will cause this - you'll need to get another SIM to test this and replace the SIM with one active from your carrier if it's the cause.\nHave you tried another SIM from your carrier - it doesn't have to be attached to an active contract or active line - it just has to be working. Try to rule out that the sim itself is bad or has failed. A good SIM will get you to \"waiting for activation\" and a full restore so you can copy apps to the phone and otherwise use it on WiFi. Putting your SIM in another phone can help know that your SIM is not bad, but it has to work in your phone, so you may need to get another SIM even if yours works in another device.\nOnce you rule out the SIM - you'll need to rule out software. Do another restore of the phone following this knowledge base article. If that doesn't work, force the device into restore mode to get the software loaded properly. Be sure there's not a failure in the restore process or you'll be wasting time on SIM olympics or getting your phone swapped.\nThat's the third part of #2 - if your phone has a failure (dust or dirt, contact problems, moisture or corrosion on the inside that is causing the circuitry to break, or just a random electrical failure) you will need to get it in for service. There a technician will have the tools (otoscope, test rig, test SIM, good software to restore your device) and the training to know what worn contacts look like to know if it's a cleaning/reseat issue or a hardware repair is needed.\n\nA: Your iOS update from 4.1 to 4.2 has relocked the device to its previous network. You need to unlock your device using a permanent unlocking method to avoid such hassle on your every future updates. I would suggest  you to get the remote unlocking service from Onlinegsmunlock.com this method of unlocking is safe, simple, affordable, quick and permanent. /it doesn't require a jailbreak too.

I have a number of programs that need Adobe Flash v10. Two of the programs have to do with my husband's business, accounting and load tracking. He is a trucker, I am his \"bookkeeper\".\nIs there a program that emulates Flash? I am told that there is a problem between Apple and Adobe and Adobe will not allow iPad users to use Flash. This is really making me nuts.\nIs there anything that I can use to get my work done?\n\nA: There are apps that will allow you to run flash apps on a remote Mac, PC or server, and view the results on an iPad. RDP, VNC, and others.\n\nA: I have to disagree with jhocking's answer.  There is an app in the iOS app store called iSwifter. From the description of the app:\n\niSwifter Flash Browser unlocks your favorite Flash content on your iPad, letting you view videos, Flash websites, and best of all, interactive Flash applications...\n\nI've used it and it works as advertised. However, it only works with the iPad. Also, the app is free, but there is a 10 (?) hour limit and after the 10 hours is up, you have to buy the \"pro version\" for $4.99.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is not a way to run Flash on websites on the iPad.\nThere is technically a way to publish from Flash to an iOS app, but that's different from what you're asking. That's only relevant to people making apps, not people using the apps.\n\nA: There was, is and most likely never will be any way to run Flash on iOS. Apple argued, Flash has too many performance problems, which is even more important on mobile devices with limited resources and battery. Until this day Adobe hasn't come up with a version of Flash which runs acceptable on mobile devices where it can be installed, like those running Android.\nEven if Flash could be installed on iOS or if you would get an Android tablet, there is no guarantee you're able to use the Flash apps you want to use. All of them would have to be rewritten by the developer to support touch input. But Adobe has abandoned Flash for mobile devices at the end of last year which makes it essentially a dead-end technology. So, I don't think any Flash developer will rewrite their apps to support touch input.\nYour best bet is to look for alternatives of the Flash apps you've used, there are excellent accounting apps in the App Store.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force Mac OS X to close all the applications when restarting? I sometimes shut down my Mac, and I cannot wait it shuts down because I am urgently requested to do something in another office that would require some hours. In some cases, an application that opens a dialog box asking if I really want to close the application blocks the shut down, and when I return I find the Mac still on.\nIs there a way to force the Mac to close any applications, instead of blocking the shut down?\n\nA: All you need is to open Terminal.app and type:\nsudo shutdown now\n\nThat way the system will be forced to terminate all open programs, ignoring any unsaved file changes.\nSo, in order to be able to launch it via the desktop, you need to open Applescript editor, and type:\ndo shell script \"shutdown now\" with administrator privileges\n\nSave the script as an Application, and drag it in your Dock, or somewhere where you'll find it instantly.\n", "Q: Reinstalled my MacBook Pro, resync with iPad issues I just wiped my MacBook Pro clean as part of my yearly reinstall habit. The problem is, now when I connect my iPad or iPhone, there is no really trivial way to sync my PDFs and ePubs back with the clean MBP. If I sync Books, it will overwrite my iPad and I'll be left without said PDFs/ebooks. I have all of them backed up, that's not the problem. I was just wondering if there's a way to do a two way sync, meaning take the pdfs/epubs I have on my ipad then sync them with the MBP. Or is this going to require me manually putting back all of my content sourcing from the MBP first? \n\nA: I do this all the time - introduce an iOS device with content to a new library (whether it's on the same or a different computer).\nIn your case, if you simply don't sync until you reintroduce the last good backup of iTunes then everything will be fine again. But let's assume you don't want to do that and continue with the question as asked.\nYou can cancel the sync when the warning about erasing the content appears. At that point go and deselect the automatic sync option so you have time to transfer the documents.  \nThen you can use the File menu \nTransfer purchases from \"device\" to get all the \"apple iTunes store\" content into the new library. This is a smart merge so you don't get any duplicates. Lastly, inspect the Apps tab to check for any third party data you might want to transfer. \nI also use the iBooks email to get a few PDF off an iOS device but you may want to look into trying and later purchasing PhoneView which lets you move documents to/from your device to a mac with ease. It's very powerful and goes far beyond what iTunes allows.\n\nA: Whenever I've synced my iPhone after loading books onto it via the \"Open With\" emchanism on the phone - e.g. from Dropbox - it's always copied them down into iTunes for me.  It should do the same for you, although I'd definitely suggest making sure that iTunes backs up your phone first.\nHaving said that, if you ARE going to reinstall your Macbook every year, you should absolutely be making sure that all of this stuff is backed up before doing so.\n\nA: What you really want to do is convince the reinstall of OS X (and so iTunes) that it already knows your iPad, rather than a sync resulting in everything being overwritten.\nHow to do this? Well, the iTunes library has an ID that is linked to your iPad. Right now the iPad's ID has not changed, but your library's ID has changed. When you reinstalled OS X and iTunes, a new library was created with a randomly generated ID that is not the same as your iPad's ID.\nThe general process to correct this if you wanted to go this route:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the ID of your iPad library (this would have been the iTunes library ID before you reinstalled).\n\n*Replace the ID of the reinstalled iTunes library with the iPad ID (rather than the ranomly generated one that was created on reinstall).\n\n\nWhile there is a great automated tool for this for Windows, there is not one that I know of for OS X. You most definitely want to backup your libary if you attempt this:\n\n\n*\n\n*This link has very clear and detailed instructions on first recovering your Library ID from your iPad (because you can backup without having to clear the phone)\n\n*Now you must update your iTunes library with this ID. Clear instruction on how to do this are on this link. This requires getting down and dirty with a hex editor, which if you are not comfortable with, you'll probably want to avoid. You'll notice those instructions are in reference to managing an iOS device on multiple iTunes installations, the process and results are the same, you can consider that your old OS X install would still have access to managing the iPad if the install existed.\nI've completed this process on a variety of OS X and Windows install when the machines have been reformatted. It works and allows me to transfer music and whatever else back onto the new iTunes install.\n", "Q: Addressbook resolution for International Callers Numbers in my phone are stored in the following formats\n+1.305.555.1212\n+1.202.555.1212\n+44.222333444\n+44.222.33.3444\n+91.22.34567890\n+91.98765.43210\n+91.98.76.543210\n\nAll calls from the USA show the proper entry from the Addressbook regardless of the format that the number is stored in my address book.\nWhen I get calls from UK or India, the Addressbook lookup does not work most times - over 90% of the calls just show the number. Very rarely do I actually get the name.\nFunnily enough, Addressbook lookup works perfectly for SMS messages.\nWhat do I do to mitigate this?\n\nA: Make sure they are in the Address Book on your iPhone. The ID will resolve itself via the Address Book if the Caller ID itself can't be resolved. The caveat is that this is an entirely manual process on your part. I get phone calls from the UK here in the US, I've never gotten Caller ID to resolve on its own, but as long as the number and name is in the Address Book, then I know who is calling.\nThere is probably a jailbroken-phone method, but I don't know anything about that to provide a reasonable answer.\nUPDATE per your comment: The format of the number received and the number in your phone has to match. I have the impression the OS is looking at the numbers with a simple string comparison, so it's an all-or-nothing scenario. I had a problem with this until I copied and pasted the numbers in the call log into the Address Book entry, then everything eventually worked out fine. Sometimes I get the odd formatting (I'm guessing it depends on which carrier's calling card was used), but now I have a tidy collection for each entry on valid phone numbers. It's still manual, and it's still a hassle to maintain at first, but it was the only way I saw around the problem.\n", "Q: How to get rid of the \"Other...\"-Account on the login screen? Suddenly my MBP shows an \"Other...\"-Account on the login screen. I searched for a solution to get rid of it and found a couple of answers that say I have somehow activated/enabled the root user. All I did was using a couple of trivial sudo-commands at the command-line, but nothing experimental or which I am unfamiliar with...\nThe suggested solutions said I need to deactivate the root user in the Directory Utilities but it was not activated. \nAre there any other solutions to get rid of this \"Other...\"-Account?\n\nA: Have you tried the sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool false in the terminal?

Obviously this can be problematic for battery issues, but sometimes a user wants this capability all things considered.\nDo the Macbook Pro offer this on any of the USB ports and if not is there any chance its wired and just has to be enabled?\n\nA: my macbook pro 2014 has a always on usb on the right side. the left one will lose power when the screen shuts off. \n\nA: Apple has a support document on this topic.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049\n\nTo meet requests for additional power from these Apple peripherals and devices, some Apple computers and displays can provide up to 1100 mA at 5 V through the port to which the Apple peripheral or device is connected. This power is available under certain conditions:\n\n*\n\n*An Apple peripheral device must be plugged directly into an Apple computer or display. Apple peripheral devices connected to hubs will not have access to extra power above the standard USB specification of 500 mA.\n\n*Your Apple computer or display must be powered on and must be awake. If your Apple computer or display is asleep, all ports will provide a maximum of 500 mA at 5 V. If your Apple computer or display is powered off, no power will be provided.\n\n*The port providing extra power is determined by the first Apple peripheral or device to connect to the Apple computer or display that requires power beyond 500 mA at 5 V. The remaining ports will continue to offer 500 mA at 5 V. Some Apple computer and displays may offer the ability to operate more than one USB port at 1100 mA at 5 V. On those computers, the second or third port is enabled when an appropriate device is connected.\n\n*An Apple computer started up to Windows via BootCamp will not provide extra power.\n\n\n\nA: Results on my experiment:\nNone of the 3 USB ports on my MacBook Pro 17 inch early 2011 will charge when the computer is off. All of the USB ports will charge A NON APPLE PHONE (HTC One V, the only device I tested) when the computer is asleep. \nThis is true both when the charger is connected and when the charger is not connected. Be aware that when the charger is not connected the charging power is coming from the laptop battery, depleting it.\nSee the comments to the answer by donlaur, below  for information on charging Apple phones, which work differently.\n\nA: The USB ports on any relatively recent MacBook will provide power while the computer is asleep, but I doubt they would while it is shut down.\n\nA: My Macbook Air does this, I assume that the Macbook pro is the same.  Have the lid already closed and plug it in.\nSome PC's do this, but for laptops, it would be a good way to drain a battery.  It depends on the power this thing drains if you need a low or high powered USB.  \n\nA: Empirical evidence from my experiment:\nNone of the 3 USB ports on my MacBook Pro 17 inch early 2011 will charge when the computer is off.  All of the USB ports will charge A NON APPLE PHONE (HTC One V) when the computer is asleep. I read that for Apple phones the Apple Company has set them to require that the computer be turned all the way on, not sleeping.

And like all macs, there is never enough ports.  I've been searching and searching to find a USB hub that power 3 external USB hard drives.  \nAny advice?\n\nA: Make sure the hub you buy powers each port to 500mAh. Most name brand hubs do this so you'll have to go to lengths to find a cheap / lesser specification hub that doesn't come with a plug in power supply to not be able to power three devices.\nIn general, shopping for items that Apple has chosen to sell through online store is a great way to identify which vendors make quality products. The best of the best items get placement in the retail stores.

Basically that means that the dock is always visible if no windows are in its space, but if a window gets too close, the dock reverts to autohide type behavior. I can only find \"autohide\" and always visible. I would prefer something as I described.\n\nA: I have developed an application (mainly using AppleScript) that does this, or at least very close to what you want: https://github.com/gjherbiet/DockIntellihide.app\n\nA: No. I don't believe that this is supported by Apple at this time.\nSorry for the pessimistic answer, but to my knowledge it's true.\nThere may be ways to run Docky or the like through macports or fink.\n", "Q: Unable to reactivate cancelled MobileMe trial account I tried MobileMe a while back but never subscribed.  I have since used the same Apple ID to enable Find My iPhone and this works fine.  I log in at me.com and get redirected to me.com/find.  However, no matter what I try there doesn't seem to be a way to reactivate a paid-for MobileMe account.  Am I missing something?\nThe support sites tell me to go to me.com/renew, but if I do this I get redirected to me.com/find.  I've checked https://appleid.apple.com and there doesn't seem to be any option for viewing or upgrading my MobileMe details.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: That account shouldn't be burned since Apple explicitly allows for renewal of expired trials as part of the normal upgrade process. You will very likely lose your data if it has been expired past 15 days but you shouldn't lose the account if you still know the password and can answer security questions or account history questions if you get to a human for support.\nThe system is in the middle of a change where they are phasing out physical box with activation codes and moving to all online activations.\nIf you can't renew it following this link then hop on the Express Lane and ask for help with Mobile Me billing. You should get connected to someone that can look up your account and see why it might be blocked.\nI have had success adding these accounts as a sub-account on a family pack as well, but that involves more money or finding a friend to \"resuscitate\" your account long enough to renew it as a stand-alone account.\n\nA: I have the same problem...

GNU Screen's default meta-key is Ctrl-a, which is really inconvenient for me because I frequently use Ctrl-a and Ctrl-e to move the cursor to the beginning or end of the line.\nI'd prefer to change this to Cmd-a instead. I know this can be changed in my .screenrc file, but how do I encode the Cmd key?\n\nA: I generally think the command idea is a bad one, because it is intended to be the system key for app manipulation. Cmd-l appears to be unbound in the application menus, but I couldn't use any tricks to view what it's keycode may be. Thus, I would suggest Shift-Ctrl-a.\nHaving said that, if I understand the man page, and a resource on the Ubuntu Forums on the topic, I believe you can change it to Shift-Ctrl-a either by using the -e flag (which I suggest you use to test with before putting it in your ~/.screenrc).\nYou should be able to run screen -e ^AA. ^ is a common identifier for \"Ctrl\", and A means capital-a (shift + a), as opposed to a lowercase a, meaning the character by itself.\nIf that works, you should be able to add a line into your ~/.screenrc that says: escape ^AA for it to automatically take place on any standard execution of screen just by itself.\n\nA: As usual, I would also recommend trying out tmux. It's kind of a \"screen on steroids\". It uses C-b as its prefix key, but even that is configurable. tmux allows you to easily configure every aspect of it. As per the tmux FAQ, you can change the prefix to C-a like this:\nset -g prefix C-a\nunbind C-b\nbind C-a send-prefix\n\nOf course, since you wanted to get rid of C-a anyway, you may be happy with C-b instead.\nYou can easily install tmux if you have MacPorts installed, by running:\nsudo port install tmux\n\n\nA: run 'cat' in a terminal and press cmd-a to see what characters it sends. You can then use that in your .screenrc\n", "Q: Issues with replacing the internal hard drive in a mid 2007 macbook I have a white 2007 MacBook with a 2.0 GhZ intel Core 2Duo processor with a 80GB Serial ATA @ 5400 rpm. Recently my hard drive crashed so I got a new 500Gb Western Digital AV-25 WD5000BUDT 500GB 5400 RPM 32MB Cache 2.5\" SATA 3.0Gb/s Internal AV Hard Drive. I registered the hard drive and tried installing the hard drive into my machine. When I try to partition using the disk utility it gives a \" Failed to partition ,I/O read/write error\". Interestingly for some reason the disk utility tool says that the hard drive is 3.6TB when it is actually a 500Gb hdd. Has anyone ever faced this kind of problem and if yes what is the solution?\nAlternatively should I go for a Hitachi hard drive?\nAdditional information: When removing my old hard drive I somewhat damaged the hard drive bracket. Do you think that this damaged hard drive bracket is the reason?\nAny help will be really appreciated.\n\nA: You're not the first person to have problems with this drive in a Mac - see http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/apple-notebooks/217444-macbook-pro-hard-drive-replacement-wont-format.html\nIt's possible there is a compatibility issue, as you seem to be doing all the right things (and it is connected properly otherwise you wouldn't see it in Disk Utility at all).\nThe damaged hard drive bracket would not be the cause of the error above.\nTry a non-AV drive (one designed for notebooks rather then surveillance/home theatre use) and see if that makes a difference.\n", "Q: Formatting a used MBP after booting from OS DVD? I'm installing a MacBookPro via DVD which I booted from. Do I use Disk Utility to format the HD which has an OLD OS X, with users info on it that I don't want, so it WON'T upgrade and retain user data, and instead would actually install a fresh copy with NOTHING inherited?\n\nA: Yes, during install you can start disk utility and re-partition/format the hard drive.  Make sure you set it as a GUID partition type so that OS X recognises it is a boot drive.\n", "Q: Time Machine External Drive What factors are important when selecting an external hard drive for time machine backups?\n\nA: Make sure the drive is from a reputable supplier.  I've used Western Digital external drives without a problem.\nWhen you get the drive it will most likely be formatted in NTFS format (for Windows), so when you plug it in, you will need to open Disk Utility and repartition it as HFS+\nA Firewire 800 drive is fastest, although since the backups are incremental and happen in the background (with only the changed bits/files going across), I believe the cost/benefit factor is weighted towards getting a cheaper but higher capacity USB 2.0 drive.  That's just my opinion.\n\nA: The most important factor is get a drive as soon as you can and make sure it's always connected. Even the cheapest slow USB drive is so much better than none. \nGet something that is built strong enough for your environment (for most it's sitting on a desk but is more a factor if you travel with the drive) and looks appropriate sitting by your mac. \nSpend a little more money to buy a lot more space but don't break the bank on the biggest drive unless you really need it. I've been served well getting the lower end drives sold in the Apple stores (they tend to stock the best quality at decent prices) even if I don't actually buy it there. I usually get the middle sized drive and upgrade the size until the jump in price is $65+ for the next larger size.\nI'll disagree on the necessity to get a certain speed interface or FireWire.\nThe only times you really notice a faster drive for backups is the first time you backup all your data and if you ever have to restore the drive.\nTimeMachine runs in the background with low priority (incremental backups over the network get done promptly which is way slower than USB speeds). Your use of the mac isn't disturbed while the backup progresses, so only spend the extra $$ on a faster interface or fancy disk if you really need that speed in the event of a restore. \nWith my backups, I've been happy buying less expensive drives more often than I could if I bought the best. When the drive fills or 18 to 24 months pass, I \"retire\" that drive, putting it on the shelf for permanent storage. This keeps my backup drive fairly new and I have longer history if I need to go back to older files. If you intend to run the drive for 3+ years into the ground, then it's nice to spend another $25 to $150 or so on the best quality drives with a longer warranty.\nLastly, I would avoid any drives that are not a single unit. Raid increases the parts and size which is statistically less reliable. I prefer less chance of failure on my backup drive rather than a bigger bucket of backups.\n\nA: *\n\n*STORAGE SPACE\n\n*Firewire is preferable\n\n*Good brand so you know it won't fail shortly after purchasing it.\n\n", "Q: How to find & delete an obscure file of which I only know the name? Sophos detected a trojan which it cannot remove on Mac OS 10.4 and it says to remove it manually. Problem is, it gives the file name as xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx where the x's are hex digits. No directory path, no nothin—just the digits.\nHow do I find and delete this file?\n\nA: There are a variety of ways of searching for a file by name.  I'd just open the Terminal and run locate xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx, although the locate index is only updated once a week, so if it's a new file it might not be listed.  If you want, you can manually force an update with sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb (you'll need to enter your admin password for the sudo).\nYou can use Spotlight in the Finder, but it leaves out system files by default -- there's a way to change this, but it's a little complicated and may not be the same in 10.4. (EDIT: instructions for doing this in 10.6 are in Apple's KB #HT4355.)\nFinally, you could use the find command: sudo find / -name xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx -- this will require your admin password for the sudo, and will be slow (it actually looks at all your files to find a match), but should find things the other options might miss.\n\nA: If your mac has spotlight, mdfind is a much better command line too for locating a file.\nNext in speed / efficiency would be locate (which uses a typically week old cached version of the find command to index files)\nLastly the slower find to crawl the directory from a root folder you wish to begin the search.\nAll the tools can fail to find files, mdfind has built-in exclusions (few and mostly system cache and internal files), locate can be out of date and excludes sone files by rule as well, find of course needs permission to traverse directories so it can fail to find files that have restrictive permissions.\n\nYou can of course use the finder to search spotlight (which is basically what mdfind does) and ask to include system files assuming your file is squirreled away in some temporary folder and not being found by the default spotlight settings... Command+Option+Space\n\n\nA: I can recommend EasyFind and Find Any File (of which I'm the author, incidentally). Both search for file names on entire disks. They search even in places where Spotlight never looks (e.g. in the System and Library folders). In case of Find Any File, you can even easily search as root user, so that it even finds files usually not accessible to you.\nBoth tools are also better than the \"locate\" command because they search the current disk catalog, while locate only looks inside a database that needs regular updating - so it won't find files that were only just created, e.g. after installing some new software via an installer.\nAnd both are much much faster than using the find command.\n", "Q: What is a good chess app for an iPhone 4? I am interested in learning chess better, and my past experience with chess programs is that if there are multiple difficulty levels, they go very quickly to \"I can usually beat this\" to \"Cut to the chase and resign.\" I haven't been able to find a rough area I can beat 30-70% of the time, get a little better, knock the difficulty up a notch, and win 20-60% of the time. (And then bump things up when I can beat the new level 30-70% of the time.)\nAre there any good chess trainer/chess iPhone apps that are out there? (Are there good chess trainers to recommend on other grounds?)\n\nA: Oddly, the app I favor the most is Deep Green due to the elegance, simplicity and design. It is fairly forgiving for novices but the middle ground is very level so as to allow you to improve without getting totally destroyed. If you have a decent strategy, you can get a lot of play in the middle ground as long as you don't make whoppers of mistakes. I say oddly because it doesn't have many bells or whistles to \"teach\" the game - lacks opening books, training modes, post game analysis or export functionality. It has beauty and simplicity and I find myself actually playing it because it's gorgeous and I learn more when I play more.\nShredder Chess seems to be stronger for learning, but is not nearly as pretty and I'm not serious enough to want to play it over Deep Green. It has fabulous end game support, databases, move puzzles and hints. It also exports the games and has a discount on the Mac version so you can take your analysis to the computer which probably makes this the best learning program. You can preview the engine and the feel of the UI on the mac for free here to get a sense of the program. The iPhone app plays a lot like the mac app. It's a 30 day demo and it's not as massively strong as Fritz and some of the really bonkers engines out there.\n", "Q: Can't preview files in column view I'm suddenly not able to preview files in column view, or select them in the Open File dialog. Selecting the file gives me a spinning beach ball, and eventually I end up relaunching the Finder. I've confirmed that .jpg, .pdf, and .app files all do this, so I'm assuming it's an issue with previewing the files. Has anyone experienced this, or have any suggestions on resolving it?\nI'm running a G5 PPC Mac with OS X 10.4.11\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: Two things you can try :\nIf you don't need the preview feature in column mode (or for a short term fix), you can disable the preview column by going to View Options cmd-J in Finder and unchecking the \"Show preview column\" checkbox.\nAlternatively, you can disable Quartz 2D Extreme (which should be disabled by default, but may be active and been known to cause Finder and preview slowdown). You can run the following command to disable it regardless.  \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver Quartz2DExtremeEnabled -boolean NO\n\nRun this command in Terminal (found in the Utility folder in Applications).  You will then need to reboot your Mac.\n", "Q: Backing up entire drive (10.4.11) to FAT32 external for complete wipe I'm quite inexperienced with OS X, despite being a fairly competent Windows techie, so I definitely need some help with this ancient family computer.\nIt's an old Mac Mini, has a lot of photos, music, etc., but it's gotten so unbelievably slow over the years that my gut is telling me a complete wipe would be the smartest solution.\nProcessor 1.66GHz Intel Core Duo\nMemory 512 MB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n\nI have a terabyte-sized FAT32 partition on this USB external hard drive, and what I want to do is back up the entire disk so I can wipe the drive and install (preferably) a more recent edition of OS X.\nDisk space isn't an issue; all I need is that files can be plucked from the backup later as necessary without restoring the entire thing.\nThe last time I tried to make a backup with just the command line it managed to start recursively copying the backup into itself, so I really am hopeless doing this alone.\nCan anyone help me out?\n\nA: FAT32 isn't up to faithfully preserving Mac permissions, links and metadata. If you cannot repartition the drive as GUID/HFS+ it would be best to make a Disk Image on the FAT and back up to that image.\nIf your drive was 120G and had at least 10G free space you should be fine with settings like this to create the image. The sparse image is nice since it only fills as files are copied but it can expand to the size specified if needed.\n\nThen you could then use Disk Utility to \"restore\" the data from Macintosh HD to the mounted image file. The HFS+ data would all be properly encoded and stored in one big file on the FAT drive. I don't know file size limitations on FAT anymore so that would be the one flaw in this plan if you needed an image larger than could be stored on the drive as formatted.\n\n\nA: Is it possible to reformat your USB drive? If so, I would repartition it as a GUID drive and then format it as a HFS+ drive.\nFrom there you can use a cloning program like Carbon Copy Cloner to clone your Mac mini drive to the USB drive. This will allow you to a bootable clone of your existing Mac mini.\n", "Q: can't partition hard drive I tried to make a partition on my macbook for windows. I was unable to do so, because, apparently, the hard-drive has been damaged. Since I do not have osx installation cd, I tried to recover using 1) disk utility and 2) from command line (exiting the desktop, at boot).\nIn both cases I failed. In particular, doing that by command line seemed to be fine (the output message was something like \"disk recovered\"). But then, again, when partitioning I always get the error message that the disk is corrupted.\nDo you know how could  I possibly solve this problem without osx cd?\n\nA: One suggestion is to grab this recovery CD. If you like you can use a USB stick instead but I find the CD to be easiest.\nOf course, you'll need a functioning computer and CD burner to make this happen so perhaps this isn't possible for you.\nIf it is possible, burn the .iso, insert the CD, and when booting up, press 'C' immediately after the startup tone plays.\nYou'll be presented with some options. Just click Enter for these until you find yourself in a live Linux environment that looks like this. You'll be able to use the graphical tool GParted to see what's going on with your partitions. GParted is a very powerful utility. In an (almost) worst case scenario you'll at least be able to recover your data from the HDD.\n\nA: Well, since your disk is damaged, you'll probably want to get a new one to replace it, yes?\nWhen you order your new drive, get a USB (3.0, if supported) adapter to go with it.  Then, when they arrive, mount your new drive via the USB adapter and install a bootable OS X system on it.  Make sure to partition it as a 'GUID partition table'.  Also, leave yourself enough room for your extra partition(s) at this time.\nOnce you can boot from it, you could backup your existing HDD to it, then swap the new one into your macbook.\nAlternatively, you could just get the new drive bootable and then install it, using the USB adapter with your old drive to retrieve your data.\nAlso, you should be able to get a copy of the OS X installation program from the App store.\nYou might also try to press and hold the  key during boot -- immediately after the boot tone and before the grey screen.  This should present you with a choice of bootable images.  One of them should be a recovery partition that was created when the OS was initially installed.  That might allow you to attempt to repair your HDD.  This is also the mechanism you'll use to boot from your new external disk when you install OS X to it.\n", "Q: Microsoft Office 2011 right-to-left (Arabic) doesn't work I'm facing a problem with Office 2011 for MAC, for example, when you open WORD 2011, and key in some Arabic letters, each word will appear as discrete letters not connected as one single word as it should be !!\nArabic language pack is installed on the machine and works perfectly with many other apps and browsers.\nwhat should be done to get rid of this annoying problem ?\nthanx in advance.\n\nA: If you want type RTL in Mac OS X I suggest you NeoOffice (it's not 100% like MS Word but it can done most of MS Word Job) or you can use OpenOffice and iWork.\nIf you want use MS Word 2011 (not earlier version) you can use some trick to solve your problem. make one document in RTL language in Windows MS Word (in your case you must use Arabic) then bring it to mac and open the document and delete the text and save the document as a MS Word Template (your desired name), then each time you need to write text open your template in MS Word 2011 (when you want open the document you have ability to open the desire template).\nBut you must consider that this solution is not bug free, if you want use RTL and LTR at the same time you will encounter some bugs.\n\nA: MS Office for Mac OS X has never supported RTL scripts.  You must use another app.  Mellel is the best. TextEdit, Nisus Writer, OpenOffice also work well. Pages 4 has bugs that make it unsuitable for RTL for most purposes, but Pages 5 should work ok.  Pages beta for iCloud also works after the update of 11/21/14.  MS OneNote can do RTL on both OS X and iOS.  MS Word for Mac 2016 Preview still not does support RTL.\n", "Q: What will be changed if I install Configuration Profile on my iOS device? In some site offers and forces me to install Configuration Profiles on my iOS device. iOS will warn me it'll change something important but the site is talking nothing will be changed. Of course I can't trust the site. Because it feels something like ActiveX on IE, and the site is lying.\nBut now, some people (including my boss) pushes me to use the site. So I want to know exactly what will be changed when I install the Configuration Profile.\n\nA: Unless the web site is part of a registration to allow you to run a custom app, your hesitation might be well founded.\nConfiguration profiles are used for two main purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*To allow you to load applications that are not approved on the Apple App Store. \n\n*Restrict what you do on the phone just like parental controls can restrict a mac from doing certain things.\n\n\nThat profile contains a secure certificate that tells the iPhone to trust and run applications that are tagged by an enterprise developer for in-house development. This is really nice for companies to make a program that doesn't match what Apple wants to sell or provides more security than selling it to the general public. The second half can mean the enterprise can issue a remote wipe, enforce password lock restrictions, prevent you from installing apps, and many many more diverse settings. You can get documentation on these restrictions at the Apple Enterprise Site and by downloading the iPhone Configuration Utility for free and playing with it to create your own profiles. You have no way of knowing what's in the profile unless you download it to your computer and have a look using the Configuration Utility. You can make a profile that changes no settings and just allows special apps to load and run.\nIf you ever want to remove a profile and find it's locked you out, you can always restore your device in iTunes losing all the data and programs and the profile in one fell swoop.\n", "Q: How to revert OS X Snow Leopard default theme?

It's a great app and really worth the 99 cents.\nNB: there's also a free Camera Plus app, it's not the same as Camera+ and I haven't tried it.\n\nA: Here is a solution which actually works. \n(Basically, the solution is to not take the picture with Instagram, but to open the picture from the camera roll and filter/crop it from there, and it should automatically save back.)\n", "Q: easy way to manage VMware ESXi on Mac OS X I'm a VMware guy, running a dozen of ESXi ... and i'm also a mac user and I've had it with launching VMware Fusion to boot my Win7 to work on vSphere client...\nAm I missing something? Sys Admins and Solution Architects are using Linux/Mac more and more ... Is there anyway that i can do that without having to rely on rdesktop and other unreliable workarounds?\n\nA: If you've got access to vCenter, then you can administer your servers via the vCenter Web Access page. Otherwise, if you have any Windows VMs then you could install the vSphere client in there and remote-desktop into it as a standalone application.\n\nA: For Mac OS X, no.

What are the disadvantages of jailbreaking the iPhone 4 even if it's legal? I'm interested in disadvantages in any and all terms, but especially about the warranty, future updates of iOS, and bricking?\nWill I have to jailbreak after each iOS update?\n\nA: Normally you have to jailbreak after each update. Apple is willing to close the open doors.\nDisadvantages: Normally your iPhone is safe. With a jailbreak it COULD get a security leak, by granting root access with a default password. Without changing that password, someone can get root access with this default password.\n\nA: As with what @New said, your phone will have to be re-jailbroken after every software update. This also means that you have to either be willing to give up your jailbroken applications until a jailbreak comes out for each new version, or wait to upgrade to the new version until there is a jailbreak available.\nAnother (in my opinion, very annoying) issue with jailbreaking is that your jailbroken applications and settings will be lost after every update. Even if there's a jailbreak available for the version you're installing, your phone is initially updated by iTunes to the normal non-jailbroken software, then you jailbreak it again. In the meantime, all of your applications that you've installed through means other than the App Store have been removed. There are products like PkgBackup to back up your jailbroken applications and settings, but the restoration is far from perfect; scanning through the list of hundreds of .plist files to figure out which ones you want to restore is not a simple, quick, or obvious task.\nI do jailbreak my phone, but I don't particularly care for having to live with these issues.\n\nA: I personally have a slight beef with the term \"voiding the warranty\" as a knee jerk reaction to jailbreaking.\nThe warranty very specifically covers the hardware and not the software one bit. \nThe software isn't covered at all in the warranty. The device is legally not fit for any purpose, may not work, may not work as intended and may not be suitable for a whole range of lawyerly things.\nConsumers don't own the software - just a temporary and limited license to use it under very specific circumstances. Modifying the software does break that license and although companies can take action, they usually encourage you to revert the changes or allow them to wipe the device and attempt to set it up correctly before spending any more time troubleshooting a software issue. It's rare to get hauled to court over breaking one or even ten license agreements but you're further out on a limb than if you don't jailbreak in the first place.\nSo the technical and social disadvantages of a jailbreak include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reduced software support from Apple in case you need help\n\n*Potentially circumventing security measures and opening your device up to compromise - you need to understand how to mitigate your jailbreak and the source of the code you run since it could be a trojan and do things you don't want\n\n*Potentially less stable or totally failing software - especially any time the device is updated or requires activation after a restore.\n\n*Inability to run some apps from the app store\n\n*Inability to get more functionality from in app purchases\n\n*Inability to rely on Apple's notification services\n\n*Potential to have hardware claims denied\n\n*Automated backup solutions through iTunes are harder and may require you to learn how to back up your phone with other tools\n\n\nIn the case where software could impact the normal operation of the hardware, you are at the mercy of the company if you bring them a phone that's been modified in a way that you were asked to not modify. Specifically, a jailbreak could fail and cause the boot portion of the phone to become corrupted. If you break a lock that you yourself have been trying to pick. The company could easily take the stance that your picking broke their otherwise fine mechanism. They might also cover the repair if they truly feel your actions were irrelevant to the specific warranty claim you are making.\nAs to future updates undoing the jailbreak - that has been the case for many updates. It's folly to predict what may happen in the future since things could get more restrictive, less restrictive or stay the same where you do have to unlock again and again as you update.\n\nA: Disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Potential reduced stability of the iDevice\n\n*\n\n*More-than-usual application crashes\n\n*Unusual application behavior\n\n*Buggy connections (like WiFi), especially on beta releases of jailbreaks. (In other words: wait until the people who write the jailbreak say it is ready for regular use. Otherwise, expect occasional pain.)\n\n\n*Potential failure of application features\n\n*\n\n*Most notably of late was the issue that iBooks would lock users out of DRM'd material if they were jailbroken. It could determine this by attempting to run unsigned code, which if it ran, would let iBooks know the device was jailbroken. A hack was released later to resolve the issue, but there is always the chance another application will also implement such features.\n\n\n*Inability to receive Apple support\n\n*\n\n*Apple doesn't want to support any jailbroken device (nor should they be required to do so). If you run into something critical, restore/upgrade to an unjailbroken state first, at which point Apple should be able to help. (Although chances are very good the particular problem will also have gone away.)\n\n\n*Increased Memory Load\n\n*\n\n*On the iPhone 4 it isn't as obvious, but it is (IMO) very obvious on the iPad 1 -- when you add services that must always be running (e.g., SBSettings, etc.) you increase the memory load on the device. Apps that were previously very close to running out of memory may do so when they least expect it, leading to unexpected crashes. This isn't particularly the fault of the jailbreak itself -- but typically one doesn't jailbreak and then not install other jailbreak-specific apps.\n\n\n*Increased Likelihood of Strange Behaviour after iOS upgrades\n\n*\n\n*Example: I had a 5-row keyboard installed on my iPhone 4. After I upgraded to 4.3.2, I ran into an immediate problem: whenever I needed my keyboard, most of it didn't appear, and most of it didn't work. Apparently parts of the 5-row keyboard configuration had stayed around after the upgrade, and the only fix was to go into General -> Keyboards and switch to the English keyboard. (At the time there was no untethered jailbreak for 4.3.2, or I would have continued the jailbreak, which likely would also have restored keyboard functionality.)\n\n\n*Increased Security Concerns\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreaking can oft mean adding software that hasn't been through Apple's vetting process, which may make it easier to get malware or other software that does \"bad things\". \n\n*If you add SSH functionality, be sure to change the root and mobile passwords; otherwise you'll get hacked in no time flat.\n\n*On the other hand, you can also sometimes get increased security. IIRC, there was a Cydia app that was used to add security to the device (essentially something Apple should have done, but hadn't to that point).\n\n\n\nPersonally, the pros of jailbreaking far outweigh the possible cons. I've had far more strange behavior than typical for an iDevice, yes, but I also expect it and know how to deal with it. Some features are such that I really expect that Apple should have implemented them to begin with, and sometimes Apple does occasionally remove one or two particular jailbreaking reasons. But until they satisfy my (very) long list of jailbreaking features, I'll keep on doing it.\n\nA: Disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Voids warranty (even though its legal) - an issue if you potentially want Apple to repair the phone.\n\n*Upgrades to iOS tend to eliminate current jailbreak methods, requiring you to perform another jailbreak.\n\n*No curated AppStore. Cydia is the main distribution method and there is no control over what is posted. Potential to install software that is malicious or could at the very least does not perform as expected.\n\n*Cannot back up jailbreak apps and data to iTunes, although workarounds exist.\n\n\nA: When you jailbreak an I OS device using a tool such as the jailbreak me site or some tool, you don’t really know what’s happening to your device; When you jailbreak your device and enable SSH, its more accessible from the outside than it once was and your phone could become less stable\n\nA: Jailbreaking is a software modification of the iOS kernel. It does not affect the hardware and therefore - as the flash ROM of any iDevice is untouched and can be always accessed using DFU mode (google it - you should almost ALWAYS use this mode when restoring an iDevice) - it is impossible to access this using ANY software mechanism, essentially meaning it is impossible to \"brick\" the device.\nAnyone who tells you otherwise does not realise this fact. Please do not be misled.\nI have always jailbroken my iPhones and have replaced my devices numerous times under warranty (I'm fussy and Apple are famous for their \"no questions asked\" customer satisfaction/replacement policy) and so as long as you do a DFU mode restore before taking it in, there is NO WAY they can tell you EVER jailbroke it. This is also a fact.\nHave fun and remember - it's your phone. Do with it as you will :)\n\nA: One thing about voiding warranty.. YES if you take it into an Apple store they wont touch it if they see its jailbroken.. so if you DO have some kind of hardware issue, then restore it first before taking it into the store. \nAfter the Genius's have done their magic, u can then take it home and jailbreak again.\nThe only issue I have with a straight jailbreak (as opposed to jailbreak + unlock) is that when there is an iOS update u cant update your phone until there is a new jailbreak for that version of iOS... not a big deal!\n\nA: I jailbreaked my Iphone4 by Evasi0n and installed Siri by Cydia,It was installed correctly but after I enabled Siri it was rebooting again and again but only the apple logo was appearing and the screen did not appear and I was not satisfied with the Jailbreak and I connected my Iphone4 to my mac and it recognized the Iphone4 and I restored it via Itunes and it became ready to use again\n\nA: JAILBREAKING= a \"thousand Pros\"\nnot JAILBREAKING= not realizing that \"thousand pros\" ;)\np.s\nIt is IMPOSSIBLE to brick an iphone..pls google DFU mode\n\nA: This should answer your questions:\n\n\nAdvantages - http://www.onlinemobilesupport.com/the-advantages-of-jailbreaking-your-iphone/ \n\n\n*\n\n*Tethering\n\n*Ultimate Customizations\n\n*Download Useful Apps from Cydia\n\n\nDisadvantages - http://www.onlinemobilesupport.com/disadvantages-jailbreaking-iphone/\n\n\n*\n\n*A Chance of Bricking your iPhone\n\n*Temporary Void of Warranty\n\n*SSH Hacking\n\n", "Q: Compare my iTunes library with the iTunes Store's Is there a way to compare my iTunes library with the iTunes Store's library, so I can find what songs I'm missing by a particular artist?  Ideally, I would be able to compare the Store and my Library by Song Title, Artist or Album name.\nI did this manually recently to see what Beatles songs I was missing.  It took a lot of time and printed pages of my iTunes Library just to find the names of the 7 songs that I needed.  There must be some easy way to let the computer do the search and comparison. \n\nA: I looked around and honestly I didn't find a great method to do this, just a plethora of different items. \nIf you activate your iTunes sidebar, you can actually go to the album in the iTunes store directly when you are playing or selecting that song.\nYou can also use things like iTunes preview to compare against your iTunes library, for instance The Beatles page has their songs and albums (though they are called top songs and albums) and you can click on any of them to get a track list.\nI found I could copy and paste the track list to a spreadsheet application like numbers while preserving the formatting, and could do the same with an iTunes library exported track list (as text), I then sorted by columns and saw the ones I did have against the ones in the albums on iTunes next to each other.\nThis isn't a great approach, but it seems like it will take significantly less time than manually printing out song lists and the like, sorry I couldn't be of more help.\n\nA: Instead of printing out pages, you could export your iTunes library (or a relevant portion thereof) into a CSV file which you can then import into Excel or Numbers. \nThis would make searching and finding things that you have easier and faster, and save paper to boot.\n", "Q: Tools for measuring wireless strength in iPod Touch?

It would be better to have it (signal strength) in a percentage format, because there some apps that show strength in some other difficult format.\n\nA: If you are talking dBm, which you will see most wifi scanning apps use, it is actually not that difficult to understand. Basically higher numbers are better, and even negative numbers actually represent positive quantities, just smaller ones. \nFrom the wikipedia entry on dBm:\nZero dBm equals one milliwatt. \nA 3 dB increase represents roughly doubling the power, which means that 3 dBm equals roughly 2 mW. \nFor a 3 dB decrease, the power is reduced by about one half, making −3 dBm equal to about 0.5 milliwatt.\nThere is also a pretty dang useful chart.\n\n\n*\n\n*−10 dBm Typical maximum received signal power (−10 to −30 dBm) of wireless network\n\n*−70 dBm Typical range (−60 to −80 dBm) of wireless received signal power over a network (802.11 variants)\n\n\nSorry for not answering the original question, but I think with this knowledge you will be able to powerfully determine the strongest source of transmissions.\n", "Q: Connect older Mac Pro (DVI) to newer Apple Display (Mini DisplayPort) I have an older Mac Pro with two DVI outputs.

The reverse does work (a DisplayPort can output DVI signals), hence the proliferation of cheap adaptors to do this.\nA number of manufacturers have build adapter boxes to allow the conversion to occur (there is electronics in these boxes that modify the signal appropriately to ensure it gets output in the DisplayPort protocol).

Can I just replace the sim on the new iphone with my current sim? Or is there something else that I need to do? \n\nA: If you want to make your SIM into a compatible iPhone 4 Micro-SIM, you'll need a micro sim cutter. Look these up on ebay in your area. They're as cheap as chips and save you a ton of bother.\nLook for DIY ways of making pre-iPhone 4 SIMs into iPhone 4 Micro-SIMs on YouTube. There's video instruction for how to do it yourself\n\nA: Since the SIM are electrically the same, you could cut the current SIM to allow it to fit the iPhone 4 slot. Otherwise, you'll need to contact your carrier. \nThey will be able to assist you in ensuring the SIM cards match your account. Apple (and this forum) can help with moving the content, but only the carrier can manage the database that tracks which SIM and which phone belong on which account.\nOften it's as simple as getting a new SIM card of the right physical dimensions and placing it in the device, but explaining why you want a new SIM to the carrier may speed things up.\n\nA: Unfortunately the iPhone 4 has a microsim card, so there is no moving your sim from pre iPhone 4 iPhones to iPhone 4. \nMost likely you can get one of these from your carrier.\n\nA: Not sure if you have it sussed by now, but I'll give you a quick run down:-)\nAll of the info on the iphone is stored in the backup file you make in itunes - the iphone stores nothing on the simcard - however if you have a simcard from an old phone you can import your contacts.\nSo the best way is to make a backup of your 3GS in iTunes and then restore you iPhone 4 in iTunes and restore from backup - then you have exactly the same on both phones and you can erase the 3GS and continue on with the iPhone 4.\nGood Luck :-) \n", "Q: Why does installing applications require Volume and mount on Mac? I am new to Mac.  In the Windows world, installers basically would be msi files.  These msi files are typically a compressed database telling the msiexec where the files should get copied.  These files would get copied to the appropriate directories. There would also be registry entries indicating that the files should get copied to Program files etc.  \nBased on this, I have following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mac/Unix since there is no control panel, I could be installing same dmg again and again. I would never get repair option.  \n\n*Why are Volume and mount required?  Isn't the installation on Unix like copying files to a target system ?.\n\nA: Note that there are usually two ways of installing applications on Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*A simple and common way is to send the user an application bundle. The user can copy it to whichever directory (s)he feels like it. Typically, applications are copied/moved to the /Applications directory and can be moved around the filesystem (or to other filesystems).\n\n*Another way is to provide an installer. Installers are helpful in case there’s need for pre-/post-flight scripts or specific directories.\nSo, answering your questions:\nIn Mac/Unix since there is no control panel, I could be installing same dmg again and again. I would never get repair option ?\nAlthough there is something similar to Control Panel, namely System Preferences.app, there is no stock application to manage applications (list, install, remove). Since most users install applications to the /Applications directory, listing applications is done via inspecting the directory, installing applications is done via copying/moving application bundles to that directory, and removing applications is done via removing application bundles from that directory.\nYes, it is possible for a user to install the same application repeatedly — but I can’t really imagine a use case for that. Maybe you’re asking this because of a ‘repair option’? What would that do? If you’re considering the case where an application bundle gets corrupted by some reason then it could be just a matter of copying the application bundle again.\nWhy are Volume and mount required ?. Isn't the installation on unix like copying files to a target system ?\n.dmg volumes are not required to install applications. A developer/distributor can ship an application bundle in a .zip file, or a .tar file, or a compressed .tar file. Many developers prefer to ship applications via a .dmg volume because it is possible to customise the appearance of the volume when it is mounted — custom background, custom icons, custom icon sizes, or a link to the /Applications directory to make it easier for the user to copy the application bundle to that location.\n", "Q: Is there a good way to distribute WPA2 keys within the 'enterprise' Due to this whole cloud thing, we've started to end up with more and more macs within our enterprise network. And, like most enterprises, we've got an internal wireless network that we'd rather not distribute the password to. Currently we've got techs visiting people and entering their wifi keys, but we'd like to be able to send folks a file they can import. Is there some tool natively in OSX that handles this? Or some 3rd party package we can use?\nIf you are familiar with Lenovo Access Connections and the key files one can send about for that, we are looking for a macbook version of that.\nClairifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*MAC address cloning is not an option. Outside of it being sham security, we've got an existing ecosystem using the current WPA2-PSK scheme and we don't want to break that. The question isn't how we can re-architect our wireless security to fit a few outliers, it is how can we include the outliers in the current scheme.\n\n\nA: So, it turns out that Loin supports iOS-style .mobileConfig profiles, so the answer is \"distribute mobileConfig files like the macbook is an iPad.\"\nI can't claim to have figured this out. The story went more like:\nHelpdesk Guy: hey, the CEO just called me, can someone get his mac on the wifi now?\nMe: Yeah, I'm in the office still, where is he?\nSysadmin Guy: Dude, you don't need to visit him, just send him the iOS mobile config file we use for the iPads.\nMe: What? That works?\nSysadmin Guy: Yeah, it does you PC loving doofus\nMe: [tests, it does open a newfangled window and holy smokes my mac has enterprise wifi] Wow, that does work, let me email this to the CEO.  \nAnyhow, I did a little looking around for documentation. I did find some verification that other people are doing this, and I also found this apple training doc which might be what you are looking for.\n\nA: Sorry if this is off-topic, but a better solution to your problem would be to setup a \"captive portal\".\nBasically, people can freely join your network but they need a username and password to leave the port (ie to connect to the internet).\nThe nice thing about this is you can keep a central database of users, or use an existing database such as LDAP. Furthermore, this would allow you to make auto-expiring guest accounts. \nBest of all, this can be setup for free with the right know-how.\n\nA: I don't know the exact answer - BUT reading this How-to - http://www.felipe-alfaro.org/blog/2006/01/29/wpa2-eap-tls/ - it looks like a few configurations steps.\nI think it should be possible på make e.g. an AppleScript that do all the nessesery steps, that you then can pack as e.g. a zip-file (key-file and AppleScript), the user then unzip and install/setup the connection.\n\nA: I would suggest using something like Packet Fence. We used to be in a similar situation where employees needed fast unobtrusive internet access and guests needed some kind of simple authentication.\nPacket Fence is a free web-based system. Our implementation involved storing all the employee MAC addresses inside Packet Fence so they can just pop open their laptops and start working without needing to authenticate.\nFor our visitors, they could access our wifi, but needed to open a browser and authenticate using a simple password. We'd also be able to log when they accessed our network.\n", "Q: Streaming music paid app I am getting really annoyed by the number of ads that I get in Pandora and am considering shelling out $36 for the paid version.\nAre there other streaming music iPhone apps that I can review before I make a purchase?\nThis will be used in USA.\n\nA: You can download and try Mog and Rdio for two weeks a piece.  They both also provide Desktop streaming as well.  I've tried both and prefer Mog.\n\nA: Hands down, I would go with MOG. It's cheap, fast, and compatible on most devices (iOS, Android, web, Roku, Mac, Windows). Option to stream songs for quick listening or download individual songs (64 kbps AAC+ normal or 320 kbps MP3s HQ).\nSearchable by track, artist, album with the addition of streaming radio stations similar to what Pandora offers.\nI've tried several services over the years, but MOG stands out with their higher accessibility and listening options.\n\nA: I highly recommend Spotify. The Mac version is free and ad-supported, or you can pay $10/month for ad-free listening, offline mode, iPhone (etc.) support, and a host of other features. There's also Unlimited for a few dollars less, but it does practically nothing but get rid of ads.\nAnother major bonus over Pandora, MOG, last.fm, etc. is that you can specify what tracks, albums, and artists are played. You can make playlists, share music with friends, or even listen to Pandora-style \"similar artists\" playlists.\n\nA: Also, if you've got a large library at home and would like to stream your library to your iOS device, Audiogalaxy is a great free option. It works like a charm and is ad free.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You  could go spotify or soundcloud i dont know but soundcloud have a deal on there where if you pay 5.99 i dont know how much they change it in the us but\n", "Q: Will OSX Lion support filevault encryption on bootcamp partitions? I'm thinking of migrating to bootcamp (from Parallels for speed), but need encryption. Apple has said Lion will have \"whole disk\" 128-bit encryption - any guesses on whether this includes bootcamp partitions?\n\nA: Personally I think it is unlikely, as Windows would need some way to decyrpt the drive, or the operating system would need to unlock the drive before Windows itself booted.\nThere are some screenshots of the process, and it looks like when they said whole disk they meant not just user home folders, but applications and root folders as well.\nhttp://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/28/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_file_vault_full_disk_encryption_and_cloud_key_storage.html\n", "Q: Is AppleTV the only device that can receive AirPlay VIDEO? 3rd-party AirPlay-enabled AV-receivers are starting to hit the market (Pioneer, Denon, Marantz), but as far as I can tell, they can stream AirPlay audio only.\nApple's page for AirPlay seems to imply the same thing. The only Apple pages that mention video streaming are the AppleTV page and the iOS 4.3 Update page, which don't make any mention of 3rd-party products.\nThis question mentions that other iOS devices and Macs can be enabled to receive AirPlay video streams through 3rd-party apps.\nSo are there any existing (or announced) 3rd-party hardware products that can do so? I'm particularly interested in AV receivers as I plan my next home theater upgrade.\n\nA: Didn't intend to answer my own question, but I found this March 2011 Bloomberg article:\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL) is weighing an\n  expansion of its AirPlay audio service\n  to include streaming video from an\n  iPhone or iPad to television sets,\n  according to two people familiar with\n  the project.\nUnder the plan, Apple would license\n  its AirPlay software to\n  consumer-electronics makers that could\n  use it in devices for streaming\n  movies, TV shows and other video\n  content, said the people, who asked to\n  remain anonymous because the plans\n  haven’t been made public. Apple now\n  only licenses AirPlay for streaming\n  audio. Devices that could be used for\n  video may be available this year, one\n  of the people said.\n\nSo apparently the answer is \"not yet, but maybe in the future.\"\n\nA: XBMC can also act as an Airplay video receiver so that'll add practically any computer to the list, but as far as I know, they've reverse engineered the protocol, so there are no guarantees it'll continue to work.\n\nA: Boxee Box works with AirPlay. You can install Boxee software on many hardware platforms so if the native software can't play Airplay you can always try to change it to Boxee. \n\nA: You can Airplay to Amazon Fire, Windows, Mac, or Android devices using Reflector 2. It claims to support sending from iOS 9 devices also (note I personally haven't tested the iOS 9 support yet).\nReflector installs an app that acts as an AirPlay and Google Cast receiver. The app is available for Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire. Since Reflector supports receiving both AirPlay and Google Cast it can receive audio/video from iOS or Android.\nIt's from Squirrels, the same company that makes the excellent AirParrot app (which allows you send AirPlay audio and video from Windows and Mac to AirPlay and Google Cast).\n\nA: These days, many TVs (such as from Samsung and LG) and Roku boxes can receive AirPlay video. I believe they also support HomeKit.\n", "Q: Show selected folders size at bottom of finder - like you can in Windows In Windows, it's easy to grab a bunch of files up to a size limit.\nJust keep selecting and look at the bottom of explorer where you can see the 'selected files combined size'\nThere appears to be no way to do this in finder except for option + cmd + I, which means you have to keep redoing it. You don't get it in the 'dynamic' style like you do in windows.\nWhat's the workaround?\n\nA: The Inspector has this functionality in Finder. Instead of Command-I for get info, add the option key to use the inspector and select multiple items to get a quick summary of space (Command-Option-I)\nThe inspector window is dynamic and summoned with these keys ⌘ + ⌥ + I\nA brief history of the get info and inspector is maintained here.\n", "Q: How to reinstall Snow Leopard on my MBP? I've been installing some applications and some things are not working properly. I want to reset my MBP to factory settings. How do I do a clean installation so I can start from scratch?\n\nA: Just put in the Install DVD.\nYou can do that with the computer running and run the installer from the disc.\nYou can also boot directly to the disc by turning off the computer, putting it in, holding down the c key, and turning the computer on.\nFollow the directions, and you'll have a clean install. Your personal files and preferences will be saved, but system files will be replaced.\n", "Q: CLI - how can I specify a screen saver with the following options? Through the CLI, I would like to select the flurry screen saver set to activate in 15 minutes and show the clock.\n\nA: Firstly, set your screensaver to Flurry in System Preferences and check the checkbox to show the clock.\nOpen up the terminal and type\nsleep 900;/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine&\n\nIn 15 minutes, the screensaver will activate with Flurry and show the clock.\nThe sleep 900 line controls the delay, so 900 is 15minutes in seconds (15*60).\nYou could add an alias for this command in your ~/.bash_profile so that you don't need to type this large command every time.  eg if you wanted to have ss be the command then enter this into the ~/.bash_profile\nalias ss='sleep 900;/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine&'\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Unfortunately there isn't a general program to set arguments in the System Preferences so you will need to edit the plist files where the settings are stored.\nThe important file with the timeout and the module name and path is ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MAC_STRING_GUID.plist\nFlurry has a plist file as well for it's settings, but I suppose you could set them or use the defaults if needed.\n", "Q: JPEG XR support What kind of support does OSX have for JPEG XR (also known as HD Photo)? I know that there is a Photoshop plugin for it, but are there any other forms of support such as an image preview or other editors that can read/write the format? \n\nA: The support for JPEG XR in OS X is limited at the moment.  Being a technology designed and potentially encumbered by Microsoft patents (although as of last year JPEG XR is a ISO recognised standard and part of Microsofts Community Promise) probably doesn't help its quick adoption into the Apple system.  \nI think as use increases, support will make its way into all operating systems, not just OS X.   But even now, even Microsoft support has been limited with support for the format only appearing in IE9 and Windows 7.  \n\nA: I just reviewed this four years later.\nThere is no support for JPEG XR in iOS, OS X, or Safari. There is also no support in Chrome and I believe there is no native support in Photoshop.\nI personally find this very disappointing, but at this point there's not much hope for improvement.\n", "Q: Best way to run WINE on OS X? What is it?\n(I know, oh so subjective.)\nSo let's make that, what's the most effective and pain free way to do it? I realize those may be contradictory conditions.\n\nA: You can install wine using MacPorts or Fink they both are recommended my wine.\nAs for GUI applications for wine the only thing besides wine's own utilities is winetricks. They are pretty useful for automatically downloading and installing different applications and dlls with their dependencies. \nIf your OSX is older than 10.5 than you will definitely need to install XQuartz (newer version already include X server).\nMacPorts Install MacPorts at first.\n\nLet's search packages matching 'wine':\nport search wine\n\n\nwine @1.4 (x11)\n    Wine Is Not an Emulator\n\nwine-crossover @11.0.0 (x11)\n    Wine Is Not an Emulator (1.4-rc5 with CodeWeavers modifications for CrossOver)\n\nwine-crossover-games @10.1.1 (x11)\n    Wine Is Not an Emulator (1.3.9 with CodeWeavers modifications for CrossOver Games)\n\nwine-devel @1.5.0 (x11)\n    Wine Is Not an Emulator\n\nwinetricks @20120308 (x11)\n    downloads and installs various redistributable runtime libraries\n\nNow we see that we can either install CodeWeavers version or just usual wine. Let's install usual wine (I think that for another one you need some kind of licesce):\nsudo port install wine\nIt's also a good idea to install winetricks:\nsudo port install winetricks\nFink\nInstall Fink as deskribed here.\nfink list wine\n\n     wine                  1.3.21-1         Microsoft Windows compatibility layer\n     wine-dev              1.3.21-1         Microsoft Windows compatibility layer\n     winetricks            20111120-2       Install redistributable runtime tools in Wine\n\nLet's now install them\n\nfink install wine\nfink install winetricks\n\nAfter installation\nIn terminal enter wine and press [Tab] and you will see utiles that come with wine (and winetricks of course):\n\nwine         winebuild    wineconsole  winedbg      winefile     winegcc      winemine     wineserver   \nwineboot     winecfg      winecpp      winedump     wineg++      winemaker    winepath     winetricks\n\nwinecfg is very useful to configure wine (dlls overriding, Windows version selection, etc.)\n\nIs also probably posible to install wine on top of Gentoo prefix, but I'm not sure that you will get X support in this case.\n\nA: I would suggest using Winebottler from http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/ \nworks fine for me!\n\nA: Most pain free way is to use Codeweavers's paid for version Crossover\nIt has useful default settings and for many apps provides C4P or CrossTie which will do all the installation and set up of the app from one script.\n\nA: The best graphical install of Wine is Wineskin. It puts all the tools in a GUI and creates a standalone .app file that Mac will run as a native app. Here is a tutorial that is using Steam as an example. \nhttp://www.easypctutorials.com/windows-steam-on-mac-wineskin\nIf you plan on porting several applications then you'll want to run just one Wine environment. MacPorts or Homebrew are probably your best options. \nhttp://www.easypctutorials.com/how-to-install-wine-on-mac-os-x\nHope this helps!\n\nA: The easiest and most pain free way is to use homebrew\nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\nOnce you follow the instructions to install homebrew on this page (which include installing Xcode), you can then simply type \nbrew install wine\n\nAnd this will download and compile wine and all its dependendencies.\n"]
