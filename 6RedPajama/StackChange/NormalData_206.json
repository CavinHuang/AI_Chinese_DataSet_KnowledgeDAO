So, long story short... My brother wanted to play the pc technician and went on and formatted our main computer. I had Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a ext4 partition running there, hoping he wouldnt be so eager to mess with it since it would be more difficult.\nIt wasn't hard for him, and he formatted it first to ext4 again, and when he couldn't get linux installed formatted it to fat32. Then he formatted again (im not sure why at this point) to ntfs. So, I lost some data (most of it I had backups for) buut, I lost some videos of a very important moment for me...\nIs there any way to get my files back?

You can get it by typing sudo apt-get install testdisk and run it with sudo testdisk.\nHowever, if Testdisk fails to undelete, photorec is the more advanced option. You can install it with the command above, but with photorec instead of testdisk. When using photorec, you can set it to exclusively filter video files.

But as a precaution, would there be any drawbacks if I created a Swap on my 3TB storage drive that is shared with Windows 7? \n\nA: You would not notice any difference unless you ran out of RAM. At that point, there would be a monumental slowdown no matter if you used SSD or HDD. (Unless you have one of those fancy PCI-SSD things that are new from Intel.) However, if you plan on hibernating your computer, then there would be a slightly faster performance increase on the SSD.\nWhen editing /etc/fstab, remember to mount and partition correctly. Backup your windows partition when resizing with gparted. \nNote: Hibernation is disabled by default, as it is not compatible with many computers. \n\nA: The amount of storage that you allow for the swap area to be created over is taken from the storage you allot your Ubuntu partition to reside in. This Ubuntu partition will be protected as long as you do not erase or destroy it through another booting from a live CD or through similar mechanism.

I have dual boot installation. Can I set, for example, my Downloads folder in Ubuntu partition to show contents from certain folder in my Windows' partition without actually copying the files?\n\nA: You can link it with soft link, for example:\nln -sf /media/windows/user/documents ~/Downloads\n\nIt will link \"document\" folder to your \"Download\" folder. It means you can see and access your document folder inside Downloads, just \"soft link\", without copying files.\n\nA: You can always create a link to that specific Windows directory in your Ubuntu home folder. For example, I have my Windows partition mounted on /media/davide with name its UUID. So for me, Windows is accessible at the folder /media/davide/\"WindowsPartitionUUID\", where WindowsPartitionUUID is the UUID of the partition in which I have Windows file system.\nWith the command  \n\nln -s /media/davide/\"WindowsPartitionUUID\"/Users/davide/Downloads/ ~  \n\nI can create a symbolic link to my Downloads Windows folder in my Ubuntu home folder (~). Obviously, it depends on where you have mounted your Windows partition.\nTo see where it has been mounted, you can launch the command  \n\ncat /etc/fstab  \n\nand get the second column of the line corresponding to your Windows mounting partition which describes the path to Windows.  \nIf you don't have your /etc/fstab manually configured, you can spot your Windows mounting point by launching  \n\nlsblk  \n\nIt shows all the drives mounted on the system with the corresponding mount point.\n", "Q: Comprehensive list of Czech words in ubuntu /usr/share/dict I need a comprehensive list of Czech words.

I've got a Ubuntu machine running a software that requires internet. However, sometimes the wifi fails (router reboot for example) and doesn't find the network again, until I manually service network-manager restart or I switch off and on the wifi to find it.\nIs there a possible way to run a cron job or a supervisord job to monitor the connectivity and if the network can't be found to restart the network-manager service and connect to that specific SSID?\n\nA: I think this might be due to a new network-manager bug, as I've also started experiencing this problem only recently - I think after upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04.\nIt seems I've managed to solve this problem temporarily as a workaround with these two files:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a script file to watch the WiFi connection and toggle WiFi off and on when disconnected, e.g. ~/.bin/WiFi-Keep-Connected, with this content:\n\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    LC_ALL=C nmcli -t -f TYPE,STATE dev | grep \"^wifi:disconnected$\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        rfkill block wifi && rfkill unblock wifi\n        sleep 10\n    fi\n    sleep 10\ndone\n\n\n\n*I also have a .desktop file to keep this script running every time I login, e.g. ~/.config/autostart/KeepWifiConnected.desktop, with this content:\n\n\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/home/\"username\"/.bin/WiFi-Keep-Connected\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName=Keep WiFi Connected\nIcon=networkmanager\n\nNote: You'll need to enter your user name in the path given for Exec= above.\nNB: Sometimes restarting Wi-Fi in this way is not enough, in which case I have to restart Network Manager by entering this command once or even twice from the terminal: sudo service network-manager restart\nTherefore, it might be a better idea to modify the script above (just in case) like this:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    LC_ALL=C nmcli -t -f TYPE,STATE dev | grep \"^wifi:disconnected$\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        rfkill block wifi && rfkill unblock wifi\n        sleep 10\n    fi\n    LC_ALL=C nmcli -t -f TYPE,STATE dev | grep \"^wifi:disconnected$\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        gksudo service network-manager restart\n        sleep 10\n    fi\n    sleep 10\ndone\n\n\nA: I don't know why, but as you mention, sometimes when wifi fails, network-manager does not find the network again. \nI think that the problem is that network-manager, after a wifi connection failure, does not refresh the wifi list (and it seems that network-manager hides the the problematic network). Network-manager does not have a re-scan menu option, and disabling and enabling wireless checkbox on network-manager menu does not force a new wifi scan (as restarting the service does).\nWhen network-manager loses my wireles connection and it does not find my wifi again (and I known that the wifi is operative), I execute the command:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nIt performs a wifi scan on wlan0 interface (wlan0 is the name of the wireless interface in my laptop) and it shows you the available wireless networks, but as a side effect network-manager automatically refresh its list and finds the lost network.\nI prefer to execute the command manually when this problem happens (network reconnecting does not ensure comunication resuming, and some programs will need to be restarted).\nBut, as you mention, you can cron it, and you can do it without testing connectivity (the scan process updates your wifi list but it does not close your current wireless connection, if you are connected). \nIf you prefer you can test the conectivity using ping or iwconfig and if you are not connected then launch the scan.\nSomething like:\n#!/bin/bash\nif ! ping -c 1 -W 1 your_router_ip &> /dev/null\nthen\n    iwlist wlan0 scan\nfi\n\nBut remember that this script must be sudoed or executed with root privileges. It sends only 1 ping with 1 second timeout.\n\nA: What I think the issue is like the connection gets lost because of router's connectivity issues. Restarting the network manager couldn't help when the router itself is having issues. Rather you could create a script to put the process running the software to suspend using SIGSTOP when the connection gets lost, and again trigger to process to continue using SIGCONT when the network becomes available. And add the script to your cron jobs, scheduling it to run every minute.\nFor your reference : http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20030915193440334\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Allow users in the \"exampleuser\" group to run su -c exampleuser I want to modify sudoers so that users in the group www-data can switch to the user www-data without a password.

One of them on\n  UDP port 1194 and another on TCP 443. We recommend that you use the\n  UDP port because this functions better for an OpenVPN tunnel. However,\n  many public locations block all sorts of ports except very common ones\n  like http, https, ftp, pop3, and so on. Therefore we also have TCP 443\n  as an option. TCP port 443 is the default port for https:// (SSL)\n  traffic and so this is usually allowed through at the user's location.\n  TCP port 943 is the port where the web server interface is listening\n  by default. You can either approach this directly using a URL like\n  https://yourserverhostnamehere:943/ or by approaching it through the\n  standard https:// port TCP 443, since the OpenVPN daemon will\n  automatically internally route browser traffic to TCP 943 by default.\n  (https://yourserverhostnamehere/).\n\nBut my recommendation, from battle field, is to allow all traffic from vpn server ip address\nsudo ufw allow from ip_address_of_vpn_server\n\nDo not specify proto because OpenVPN use both, tcp and udp\nEdit 1\nAlso you can create script to auto reconnect when tun0 is down.\nAdd a simple script to caled tun-upin /etc/network/if-down.d/ which content is\n#!/bin/sh\n# filename: tun-up\n\nif [ \"$IFACE\" = tun0 ]; then\n  sudo ifup tun0\nfi\n\nmake it executable\nsudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/tun-up\n\nEdit 2\nOk, we allow wrong address.\nFirst we need to catch correct ip address to allow traffic.\nStart terminal and run command\ntail -f /var/log/system | grep UFW\n\nthen try to connect to vpn sever.

I tried Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, Linux Mint 17.1, Fedora KDE, Zorin.\n\n\n*Before upgrading the BIOS, which is actually UEFI (absolutely no settings except boot sequence), I got a quick message:\nBoot in secure mode\n\nAfter upgrading BIOS I see this quick message:\n\\EFI\\BOOT\\fallback.efi\": 14\n\nand GRUB starts after that.\n\n\n*GRUB didn't see my  Windows 7, but I thought it's OK.\n\n\n*Installation goes fine and at the end it asks to reboot. I press 'ok do it', but after rebooting I see that message (point 2) again. GRUB starts and doesn't see my fresh Ubuntu.\n\n\n*I tried to make an EFI first partition manually while installing and before it with Gparted (I DID IT A LOT OF TIMES), but nothing helped.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a live USB for Ubuntu 64-bit (e.g. with UNetBootin).\n\n\n*While on the live USB installation, select Do Something Else and make /dev/sda1 an \"EFI\" partition with size 150MB. It must be a minimum of 100MB, recommended 200MB.\n\n\n*Partition the rest of the drive however you want (/ and swap, / and /home and swap, whatever). Use primary partitions only (you might be able to get away with an extended partition for /home, but I haven't tried it). This is my setup:\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 150MB EFI\n\n*/dev/sda2 20GB ext4 /\n\n*/dev/sda3 5GB swap\n\n*/dev/sda4 50GB ext4 /home\n\n*Set the boot installer to install to /dev/sda1 (or your EFI partition #). Do not use /dev/sda.\n\n\n\n*Install.\n\n\n*Pray.\n\n\n*Awesome, now Ubuntu is installed.\n\n\n*Restart your laptop, and boot back into the live USB.\n\n\n*Now, mount your EFI partition somewhere, like this:\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n\n*Change directories into the EFI directory in the mounted folder:\ncd /mnt/EFI\n\n\n\n*Copy over the super secret important EFI files:\ncp -rfv ubuntu boot\n\n\n\n*cd into the boot directory:\ncd boot\n\n\n\n*Finally, move grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi:\nmv grubx64.efi bootx64.efi\n\n\n\n*Restart, and you should finally have a working Ubuntu/Xubuntu 14.04 on your dumbass Lenovo S205 computer! Yay!\nTo get Wi-Fi working, change the boot order in BIOS to boot from network first.\n\nA: After two weeks of heavy googling and checking many procedures, I came up with another solution. The Ideapad S205s issue is due to a not fully standard BIOS that supports UEFI installation, which is not compatible with the Ubuntu EFI installation process. GRUB does not get properly installed in no way. Fixing this problem was impossible for me. My solution is creating a little bit modified installation medium. In my case a USB flash.\n\n*\n\n*Create a standard install USB with Rufus. In used Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS.\n\n\n*Open the USB and rename the EFI folder to another name. In used EFInova, but the new name is not critical.\n\n\n*Making a copy of grubx64.efi from /EFInova to the /boot/grub folder and another copy to the /boot/grub/x86_64-efi folder.\n\n\n*These two changes force booting the Ubuntu 20.04 USB in legacy BIOS mode and also installing in legacy BIOS mode which works fine for Ideapad S205 (approved with Ubuntu 16.04).\n\n\n*After booting Ubuntu 20.04 from the USB, in Try mode prepare your HDD with Gparted in this way:\n\n*\n\n*First partition as ext4, with mount point /.\n\n\n*Second partition as swap.\nThis worked fine for me.\n", "Q: So wide desktop on Gnome My desktop has become so wide and I only can see the left half of it. sometimes applications appear on right half and I cannot access them.\nHow can I make it fit to my monitor?

The answer could be extremely obvious but I need someone to point it out.\nI was trying to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu (yes, I followed a guide, but I don't remember which one) when the Grub install failed.

The second is also EXT4, but nothing is installed there. The rest are the various Windows partitions.\n\n\n*Partitioned my disk in various partitions for Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n*Booted Windows disk in BIOS mode and installed.\n\n*Booted Ubuntu installer and installed.\n\n*Grub install failed.\nHere is my latest attempt at boot-repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11314742/\nIn this attempt I tried to do a manual install to SDA1, with the overall bootloader install to SDA, if I remember correctly.\nWhere should I go from here? Should I erase all Ubuntu partitions and try again?\nThanks!\n\nA: First, your Windows installation, at least, is in EFI mode (aka UEFI mode; UEFI is just EFI 2.x), not in BIOS mode, as your question's title claims. That said, there is evidence of a BIOS-mode Linux boot loader, so you probably either installed Linux in BIOS mode initially or ran Boot Repair at least once in BIOS mode; but there's also evidence of an EFI-mode Linux boot loader.\nSecond, have you disabled the Windows \"Fast Startup\" (aka \"Hybrid Boot\") feature? If not, do so, as described here. Note that this feature is entirely separate from the firmware's \"fast start\" (or similarly-named) feature. The Windows feature can cause corruption of partitions shared between Windows and Ubuntu, including the critical EFI System Partition (ESP), which holds EFI-mode boot loaders.\nThird, and at least as important, there are problems with your partition table:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your /dev/sda1 is identified as your ESP in your partition table, but it holds an ext4 filesystem. This is unusual bordering on invalid. The ESP must normally contain a FAT filesystem. It looks like you erred in setting up your partitions, and re-allocated the ESP to be your Linux /boot partition.\n\n*Your /dev/sda7 is FAT and holds files that would normally be on an ESP, but is marked as an ordinary FAT/NTFS volume.\n\n\nThe appropriate fix is to re-mark /dev/sda1 as a Linux partition and /dev/sda7 as an ESP. You can do this with GParted or parted by removing the \"boot flag\" from /dev/sda1 and adding the \"boot flag\" to /dev/sda7; or in gdisk by changing the type code of /dev/sda1 to 8300 and of /dev/sda7 to EF00. This fix will probably not be enough to restore your system to bootability, but it may be a necessary prerequisite, and it's certainly necessary for safety.\nAs to fixing your problem, after you both disable Fast Startup and fix your partition type code issues, try re-running Boot Repair. Be sure to boot it in EFI mode. It was booted that way when you ran it to generate the output you've shown. Typically, you must select the boot option that includes \"UEFI\" in the description.\nIf Boot Repair doesn't work, try using a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. It should enable you to boot your Linux installation, with one caveat: Because you've got a separate /boot partition, you may need to highlight your kernel, hit F2 or Insert twice, and add ro root=/dev/sda4 to get it to boot correctly. (OTOH, this might not be necessary; it looks like you've got both a kernel on /dev/sda4 and a separate /boot partition.) If rEFInd can start your system, you can either try to manually install GRUB (using grub-install) or install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package.\nAn alternative: Instead of attempting to repair your installation, you can try re-installing. You'll still need to disable Fast Startup in Windows, but once you do that, delete /dev/sda1 through /dev/sda5, fix the type code on /dev/sda7, create new partitions (one for / and one for swap should be sufficient, but you can optionally create more), and install. Be sure to boot the installer in EFI mode; do not attempt a BIOS-mode installation. (Drop to a shell and look for the /sys/firmware/efi directory. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; but if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode.)\n", "Q: Help with corrupted NTFS partition My Ubuntu isn't able to mount a partition.\nIt suddenly became unreadable because of a corrupt Master File Table. chkdsk /f is unable to correct it, saying:\nWindows will now check the disk.\nCorrupt master file table.\nWindows will attempt to recover master file table from disk.\nWindows cannot recover master file table.

When making an assignment you don't need to put quotes around a variable being dereferenced, but since the dereferencing happens in a sub shell, quotes are needed around the ${zip_file} part so that it's value is properly passed to basename.  Quotes are NOT in fact needed around the entire line, because then it's back in the context of variable assignment, where quotes aren't needed as bash will do the right thing with passing the value from the subshell to the assignment line.\nThanks @janos for pointing this out.  I'm not sure what I screwed up in testing the original line that took me down the path of excessive quotes.  You are correct, the following is fine:\nzip_dir=$PWD/$(basename \"${zip_file}\")\n\n", "Q: Permission denied error during \"hadoop namenode -format\" command I am trying to install single node hadoop cluster using this tutorial.\nI followed all the steps as mentioned the above link says but I am not able to format the namenode using command hadoop namenode -format.\nIt gives this error:\nbash: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop: Permission denied\n\n\nA: If it says permission denied, you probably need sudo.\nTry this command instead:\nsudo hadoop namenode -format\n\nIt may not be needed, but as you are having issues it may help.

As such, it is relatively safe to assume that your processor isn't restricted to a 32-bit environment.  With the various improvements in processing power between 32bit and 64bit,\nit makes sense the standard would be 64bit nowadays.\n\nIf Android says they will drop 32-but development environment support in the future that's their call, though.  True you can 'force' it to run 32-bit but soon enough that will probably cease to be the case.\nWith the standard being 64bit you should likely consider getting a 64bit OS.  You may not have to replace the entire system to achieve this unless your processor is only 32bits (in which case that system is obsoleted by today's standard consumer level PCs off the shelf which have 64bit CPUs and you should start considering upgrading if you do development)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome 14.04: stop upgrading old kernel I recently upgraded the kernel in Ubuntu 14.04 from 3.13 to 3.16.

It seems like it automatically figured out what is needed next.\nHowever, when I tried it on my Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS virtual machine, it just showed some usage instructions. Googling for apt-get install !! doesn't seem to work very well. Many search results do not contain the double exclamation mark.\nWhat does apt-get install !! do and what could be missing on my machine that it did not work?\n\nA: !! is a shortcut in bash that means last command executed.\nTry this:\n echo hello\n !!\n\nIn this context, the !! will be expanded to another echo hello.\nI imagine what happened was they tried to run a command and it failed and complained it wasn't installed.  So then they typed sudo apt-get install !! because the package name was coincidentally the same as the name of the command they tried to run.  The resulting command would attempt to install a package by the same name as the command they had just attempted to execute.\n\nA: !! has nothing to do with apt-get. It is a shell keyword that will be expanded to the previous command. This expansion is done by shell before the current command is interpreted. \nFrom man bash:\n\n!!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym\n  for `!-1'.\n\nFor example, if you run a command:\necho \"foo\"\n\nThen if you run:\nsudo apt-get install !!\n\nit will be expanded to :\nsudo apt-get install echo foo\n\nAs you can see it is expanded into two packages namely echo and the other is foo. There is no standalone package named foo and echo. Apart from the shell builtin echo there is /bin/echo executable that is a part of the GNU-coreutils package. So, you will get errors saying that no such packages are available.\nOn the other hand the other person might be doing something like this:\n$ cowsay\nThe program 'cowsay' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install cowsay\n\n$ sudo apt-get install !!\nsudo apt-get install cowsay\nReading package lists...

However, I would like to point out that there are numerous such shortcuts in various shells that help repeat/find/edit commands. Some of the ones that I use are:\n\n\n*\n\n*!$ followed by ENTER will type the last word of the last command. For example, \nls -l /let/me/in\ncd !$\n\nThis will land you in /let/me/in\n\n\n*Ctrl-R and then type a few words from a previous command. For example, if you typed vi /home/mycoolproject.sh and followed it up with some random commands like ls, cd, pwd, etc. then just typing Ctrl-R followed by cool will pull up that vi command.\n\n\nJust search for bash (or csh or whatever) keyboard shortcuts and it will be the best thing you did today!\n\nA: !! : Refer to the previous command. This is a synonym for !-1 (The source).\nFor instance, if i execute:\n./test\n\nthen remember that I need to be Root, then I could simply type:\nsudo !!\n\nit's the same as typing: \nsudo ./test\n\nIt's useful when your last command contain a lot of characters.\n", "Q: Is it possible to package installed software?

Probably shouldn't have done it anyway\nAuthentication realm: <http://seriss.com:80> Subversion repository\n\nSo this is my story and here I am asking for some advice!\nEDIT : \nHere is the older code that also didn't work\n#include <FL/Fl.h>\n#include <FL/Fl_Box.h>\n#include <Fl/Fl_Windows.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    Fl_Window window(200, 200, \"Window title\");\n    Fl_Box box(0,0,200,200,\"Hey, I mean, Hello, World!\");\n    window.show();\n    return Fl::run()\n}\n\nThis was the error : \nmain.cpp:1:19: fatal error: FL/Fl.h: No such file or directory\n #include <FL/Fl.h>\n                   ^\ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nA: For anyone looking for a way to make working this code on Stroustrup's book \"Programming: Principles and Practice\", appendix D, there is a little mistake in the header:\n#include <FL/Fl.h>\n#include <FL/Fl_Box.h>\n#include <FL/Fl_Windows.h>\n\nbut in Ubuntu (or better said: in Linux) you should be very careful with your cases, so you should have\n#include <FL/Fl.H>\n#include <FL/Fl_Box.H>\n#include <FL/Fl_Windows.H>\n\nTo check what is the EXACT name of a header, just look on /usr/include/FL/\nTo have an executable from this file (in this post, main.cpp), one just have to use\n$ fltk-config --compile main.cpp\n\nwhich generates the executable main\n$ ./main\n\nand a simple window will show.\nBy the way, on Kubuntu 14.04 I installed FLTK with\n$ sudo apt install fltk1.3-dev\n\nwhich is version 1.3.2 (new enough for my needs).\n\nA: Regarding the gcc build failure: It looks like you're using an FLTK 2.0 example and trying to compile it with FLTK 1.3.\nIf you're going to use 1.3, there is a PDF with examples that gets installed to /usr/share/doc/fltk1.3-doc/fltk.pdf.gz (from package fltk1.3-doc).\nRegarding the svn problem: you're trying to log into someone's svn repo, and they require a username and password.  You should probably change the password on your local system now because you just tried to use it to log into some other system on the internet.\n\nEdit:  Now that you've updated your code the problem has moved slightly... \nThe problems at this point are the include path, the linker flags, and the typos.\nWhen you see a failure on an include line it's because the compiler doesn't know where to look for the specified file (or it doesn't exist on your system).  So you have to add the include path to your compile instruction.  Once you move past that, you'll still need to specify appropriate linker flags so that the library that contains the objects for the included files are available to the linker.\nYou have some typos in your code:\n#include <FL/Fl.H>\n#include <FL/Fl_Box.H>\n#include <Fl/Fl_Window.H>\n\nint main()\n{\n    Fl_Window window(200, 200, \"Window title\");\n    Fl_Box box(0,0,200,200,\"Hey, I mean, Hello, World!\");\n    window.show();\n    return Fl::run();\n}\n\nAnd you need a series of confusing libraries and includes, assuming it were named something like snippet.cpp compile it like this:\ng++ `fltk-config --cxxflags` snippet.cpp `fltk-config --libs` -lX11 -ldl -lXext -lXinerama -lXft -lfontconfig -o snippet\n\nRegarding the include path:  The fltk-config --cxxflags command is producing a set of flags to pass to your gcc.  Run it by itself if you want to see what those flags are.\nRegarding the linker path:  Again, the fltk-config (with --libs) command is providing the flags for the linker.\nThe string of other linker flags were almost a complete guess on my part.  I tried compiling your code, saw some error output for undefined symbols and then based on the reported function name (and the help of the man command) I was able to guess what library provided the symbol.\n", "Q: Custom keymapping via udev/hwdb.d is not working Background: I got the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 and several keys are not working at all under Ubuntu such as the F1-F10 keys.

I installed Ubuntu for the first time a few months back, and I have recently begun to really try and learn how my system works. So today I have been reading about Swap Partitions and so I have been looking at what my setting where. I have read that its good to have no more than 2X your RAM in swap space. \nSo when I started to look at my Disks it said I had about 6GB in swap, but when I used Gparted it said my partition was \"unknown\" and unable to detect. So I found a tutorial online which walked me through setting up a Partition File and the end result was that I created a 12 GB Partition File. \nShortly after I finished I then read that Gparted cannot read Swap Partitions that are encrypted, thus my original swap Partition was not necessarily corrupted but just unreadable due to encryption. \nSo if you are in my shoes with 6 GB of Swap Partition (from install) and a newly created 12 GB swap file what would you do? I feel one of these Swaps needs to be deleted or both altered. Thanks for the help everybody!!\n\nA: There is no point in having more than your RAM in swap. By the time you have that much data stored there, you would have died of old age waiting for the incredibly slow hard drive to be used as RAM. The only reason you would want more than a few gigabytes is for Hibernation, which is disabled by default because of bugs. I would delete the 12 GB file, as you would need to edit /etc/fstab and set the new partition as swap. Backup your data first. The encryption of swap I have not heard of. Unless you are planning on Hibernating (which requires some small configuration, etc.) then there is no point in having more than 6GB of swap (with 6GB of ram).\n", "Q: seq command with && operator wont work I'm trying to make a for loop in bash where I make a beep of a particular frequency than is incremented until it reaches 500, then goes back down to 1.\nI'm using the \"seq\" command for this but I ran into a bit of a roadblock, I can't use the \"&&\" operator on seq!

So, I just got a new 4TB SSHD and I'll have a tech install it at my house by May 26 of 2015. To back up my stuff, I bought a 4TB external drive and decided to copy everything from my internal and 3TB drives to my 4TB drive. I successfully got the 1TB copied over, but I accidentally canceled the 3TB transfer in the middle of the copy -which I was using nautilus- and I want to verify the integrity of the files since I don't know how my 3TB drive got filled up fast and I just want to erase everything on it once I get the integrity checked. To check the integrity, I don't want to re-format the drive since I have some excess files on here that aren't on the other drives. I want to have a command parse the path of every file in \"directory a\" as if it were chrooted, and then verify that the file exists on \"directory b\" and has the same hash and size. If the hash is different, the size is different, or the file doesn't exist on \"directory b\", it'll copy the file again. Here's an example.\nLet's say directory A is on /a and directory b is on /b. If there is a file of 500KB that has a path of /a/eevee.png it will expect that /b/eevee.png exists and is 500KB with the same hash. If it doesn't exist, is not 500KB, and/or has a different hashsum, it will copy the file and overwrite without asking.\nAlso, an optional feature is this. If the file in directory a matches a file in directory b as I previously stated, but the timestamp is different, then the file in directory b has it's timestamp changed to whatever it is in directory a.\n\nA: I actually found a way with a lot of research, didn't dig deep enough prior to posting this. I'd like to reference it in this post here (On Ubuntu Forums, not Ask Ubuntu).

However, you can specify only to check file size.\nFor instance:\nrsync -av --size-only  source/  destination/\n\nI hope that helps. Let us know how it goes. Regards.\n\n\nA: Here's my crude script for verifying files in two folders, and if any file has an issue - copy it over. I'd suggest using this after copying over files. \nThe basic idea is to use hexdump for verifying the files. The script takes two directories as inputs. Limitation: It processes only the files inside the directory, not subdirectories ( because I don't know how to do it yet ). So you can use this if you don't have that many folders , but if you have multiple folders and subfolders, running script manually for each directory can be tedious. Food for future thought: create list of folders and subfolders for source and destination, and then automate the script going through the two lists.\nScript in Action\nI've tester2 as source directory and testerdir as destination, where I've already copied files. On line 123 I run the script to verify files being copied over. On line 124 I change contents of tester2/hello file (change its contents from \"TEST\" to \"TESTER\"). On line 125 you can see that the script detects that file hello has been altered/changed in size/corrupt , and copies the file over again.

If so, install the fuse-based exfat: \nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse\n\nand try mounting manually if the GUI won't automatically recognize it.\nIf this still doesn't work, well, we'll have to dig deeper :)\n\nA: In my case, the error was looking like this:\nError mounting /dev/mmcblk0p1 at /media/severin/1885-EB0E:\n  Command-line `mount -t \"exfat\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000...\n\n(notice the exfat in the error message)\nThe fix was simple, like specified here:\nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\nThen, I just clicked the device in Nautilus, and it worked.\n", "Q: Western Digital Hard Drive not showing the True Storage size after changing something with the Partioning in Ubuntu I was trying to get back space from the hard drive since 32GB of it was free.

I have a couple of local domains resolved to 127.0.0.1 in my /etc/hosts file. And it was all alright for a period of time but now when I run:\nnslookup test.local\n\nIt results in:\nServer:     192.168.1.3\nAddress:    192.168.1.3#53\n\n** server can't find test.local: NXDOMAIN\n\nThe 192.168.1.3 is our network DNS and it's not supposed to know my local domain test.local. After a couple of searches I found that /etc/nsswitch.conf file holds information on the priority of the DNS sources to query by. But there was no problem there! Here's mine:\n# /etc/nsswitch.conf\n#\n# Example configuration of GNU Name Service Switch functionality.\n# If you have the `glibc-doc-reference' and `info' packages installed, try:\n# `info libc \"Name Service Switch\"' for information about this file.\n\npasswd:         compat\ngroup:          compat\nshadow:         compat\n\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns\nnetworks:       files\n\nprotocols:      db files\nservices:       db files\nethers:         db files\nrpc:            db files\n\nnetgroup:       nis\n\nSo does anyone know why my hosts file is not included in DNS look-up?\n\nA: nslookup only does proper DNS resolution, which is significantly different from the Name Service Switch subsystem that your other applications use; that is to say nslookup ignores /etc/hosts and mDNS.\nTo test local resolutions like that, use something that uses NSS. ping <hostname> for example. Here's a simple demo based on an /etc/hosts entry on my network.\n$ nslookup bert\nServer:     8.8.8.8\nAddress:    8.8.8.8#53\n\n** server can't find bert: NXDOMAIN\n\n$ ping bert\nPING bert (10.10.0.4) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from bert (10.10.0.4): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.352 ms\n64 bytes from bert (10.10.0.4): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.407 ms\n\nNote that there are DNS servers and proxies that can factor in an /etc/hosts file. In these cases, nslookup might return a result from a local source.\n\nA: I guess that you want the name resolution from /etc/hosts file for the specific host (mysite.com).\nAnother common problem that can cause this behavior is that you may have many entries on the /etc/hosts file for the same IP, example:\n1.1.1.1 host1.domain1.com\n1.1.1.1 host2.domain2.com\n\nIn some implementations, this can cause the name resolution to get handed to DNS. A quick fix, group everything in 1 row\n1.1.1.1 host1.domain1.com host2.domain2.com\n\n\nA: Another common thing I see is where somebody (usually me) reverses the IP address with the hostname in /etc/hosts - for example:\nmysite.com    10.2.3.4\n\nAt first glance, it looks normal... Here is my solution about 50% of the time:\n10.2.3.4    mysite.com\n\n", "Q: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod on auth.log My auth.log is full with error messages of freedesktop, most of them look more or less as follows:\nMay 25 07:59:40 lati dbus[425]: message repeated 7 times: [ [system] Rejected send message, 3 matched rules; type=\"error\", sender=\":1.63\" (uid=1000 pid=2218 comm=\"/usr/bin/pulseaudio --start --log-target=syslog \") interface=\"(unset)\" member=\"(unset)\" error name=\"org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod\" requested_reply=\"0\" destination=\":1.1\" (uid=0 pid=503 comm=\"/usr/sbin/bluetoothd \")]\n\nAny idea what that could be?\n\nMy system info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (trusty)\n\n*Architecture: 64 bit\n\n*Kernel version: 3.16.0-37-generic\n\n*Dell E7440\n\n*Bios version: A14\n\n\nA: That message means that dbus rejected an error message (org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod) pulseaudio tried to send to bluetoothd, probably because bluetoothd called an unknown method on pulseaudio's interface.\nThe strange thing is that error replies should be allowed (you should have <allow send_requested_reply=\"true\" send_type=\"error\"/> in /etc/dbus-1/system.conf.

From the terminal you can do it using the following commands:\n1- Find the exact package name:\ndpkg --list 'google-earth*' | cat\n\nwhich may show that the package name is google-earth-stable.\n2- Uninstall the package:\nsudo dpkg -P google-earth-stable\n\n(Source).\n", "Q: Failed to build OpenCL kernel: -11 I have problems with OpenCl compilation.\nFor example, when I wan't to launch SmallptGPU :   \n\nUsage: ./smallptGPU\n  Usage: ./smallptGPU   0 and power of 2)>    \n  OpenCL Platform 0: NVIDIA Corporation\n  OpenCL Device 0: Type = TYPE_GPU\n  OpenCL Device 0: Name = GeForce 840M\n  OpenCL Device 0: Compute units = 3\n  OpenCL Device 0: Max. work group size = 1024\n  [SELECTED] OpenCL Device 0: Type = TYPE_GPU\n  [SELECTED] OpenCL Device 0: Name = GeForce 840M\n  [SELECTED] OpenCL Device 0: Compute units = 3\n  [SELECTED] OpenCL Device 0: Max. work group size = 1024\n  Reading file 'rendering_kernel.cl' (size 3216 bytes)\n  Failed to build OpenCL kernel: -11\n  OpenCL Programm Build Log:   \n\nIt returns the same error for every program I try to launch with OpenCL.\nI have nvidia-346, nvidia-346-uvm, nvidia-modprobe, nvidia-opencl-icd-346 and opencl-headers installed and CUDA works fine.\nMy computer has two GPUs (an Intel one and the nVidia GPU) so I use bumblebee, and when I wan't to use CUDA, I load the nvidia-346-uvm module, and it works fine.\nCan somebody help me to fix this issue ?\nThanks\n\nA: It works now.

I wish to know how to see user logs in Ubuntu. I realized that our son has been using his computer on days he's not supposed to. Apparently, he configured the computer that user logs are deleted so I don't see user logs except on the day the computer is turned on. Is there a way to see computer activity and which dates and time? I will really appreciate your responses. \n\nA: Try this:\nsudo nautilus\n\nInside of the window that opened click \"computer\" with the hard drive icon to the left of it. Open the folder named var, than open log, than double click auth.log, you will see a lot of information that you can ignore but focus on the date and times showing on the left hand side as you scroll down. \n", "Q: Virtualbox and networking I have installed Win 7 in Virtual Box but am unable to see my NAS Drive. I have checked under network and can see the internet. I looked under network in Virtual Box and it is set to NAT.\n\nA: Switch to \"bridged networking\" - than you'll get an IP of your LAN subnet in your virtual machine and therefore can connect to your NAS.\n\nA: The reason why you can't see your NAS, its broadcast can't reach your virtual machine when using NAT. Think as your virtual machine is behind a router.\n\n\n*\n\n*The best is what Mr.Gosh recommends (bridged networking).\n\n*Another option is to enter your NAS IP directly from the virtual machine (If you know its IP or it's static)\n", "Q: Could not initialize Applet Error I have installed java version 1.7 on my ubuntu pc .

How can I do that?\n\nA: To see what processes are running on a machine, you can use ps. This is a command with a huge number of options, so you might want to take a look at man ps to learn a little about it. \nTo check whether anyone is running watch, you would do:\n $ ps aux | grep -w watch\nterdon   15915  0.0  0.0  15912  2676 pts/4    S+   15:58   0:00 watch ls\nterdon   16123  0.0  0.0  13948  2264 pts/5    S+   15:58   0:00 grep --color -w watch\n\nThe -w tells grep to only match whole words. Otherwise, processes like watchdog would also be listed. However, that also returns the grep process itself. To avoid that, you can use pgrep:\n$ pgrep -xl watch\n15915 watch\n\nThe -x makes it look for exact matches only and the -l makes it also list the process name and not just its PID.\nNow, if you want to check for both  MyOwnCommand and watch, you could do:\n$ pgrep MyOwnCommand >/dev/null  && pgrep -xl watch\n15915 watch\n\nThe && means that the second pgrep will only be run if the first was successful, if MyOwnCommand is running. The >/dev/null discards the output of the first pgrep.\n", "Q: E: Impossible de trouver le paquet minicom I want install minicom and other package n ubuntu 12.04 baut I have this result:\nrimeh@rimeh-PC:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install minicom\nLecture des listes de paquets...

I have no issues downloading quickly or streaming live feed from my browser.\nIs there a reason that Deluge and Transmission would be downloading so slowly? \nThe magnet link I am downloading has over 7000 seeders with I had no issues downloading the same magnet link at full speed on a Windows 7 unit.\n\nA: Limit the upload speed to prevent the outgoing buffers in your network from filling up. With unlimited upload speed these buffers quickly fill introducing a network lag of up to several seconds in the outgoing direction. Since this lag also effects TCP control packets, it affects with your download speed as well. You want to limit your rate to just below the maximum throughput of your network so that the buffers don't fill. \n", "Q: When encryption takes place? I found a tutorial which might not be up to date, but I could not find a better one.\nIt states several times:\n\nThis directory is then automatically encrypted when you log off.\n\nIs this true? If yes, doesn't this mean that power loss can expose private data to someone who has physical access to the hard-drive?\n\nA: It depends on how you set up the crypt (ecryptfs). If it is set up to automatically decrypt when you log in, then yes the data is decrypted when you log in.\nThis is the default behavior when you choose to encrypt home at login.\nThere are exceptions, depending on how you log in, for example, ssh and other methods do no not automatically decrypt home.\nIf you set up a private crypt, then of course if depends on how you configured it.\nIf you need a more specific answer, you need to tell us how you set upyour crypt.\nI don't know what will happen with power loss and physical access.\n", "Q: After recent upgrade, nvidia card cannot be detected After recent upgrade from 346.59 to 346.72, my nvidia card can no longer be detected.

On updates you install unstable packages. It is possible to install nvidia drivers from there, but it is not recommended to leave that ppa always connected.\nYou can fix this by running:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nThis will remove that ppa and revert packages to stable ones.\nAnd you have hybrid graphics with Intel. Consder installing nvidia-prime too.\n\nA: I tried all I could.\nBut none really worked. (331 / 304 (the current) from stable and 346 / 349 / 352 from xorg-edgers/ppa )\nEventually I just gave up and installed the .run driver downloaded from nvidia.\nHope this info helps for people who also had the similar issue.\n*will try to do a clean installation in the future to find out more\n\nA: This may happen if running kernel is older than that was recently updated.

Shown below is my current partition configuration (which is supposed to triple boot) with,\n350MB partition for bootloader and MBR of Windows, I guess\n100GB partition for Windows 8.1\n45.02GB partition for Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 LTS (/)\n30.08GB partition for Arch Linux (/)\n5.08GB for Swap (/swap for both arch and ubuntu)\n\n\nEach time I install a new OS or reinstall one I get the grub configuration ruined. Even though there are many similar questions present already in this site, none gave me a clear vision. My doubts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which is the ideal place to install grub, provided that I haven't specified any separate partition as /boot? Will each Linux will have its own copy of grub in its /boot directory?\n\n*What if I select that 350MB as /boot partition for my both the linux? Well, I did it once and got my Windows broke.\n\n*Where to place grub in such a way that removing any individual OS from the system only make the 'entry of that OS'(from grub menu) invalid. Recreating the grub configuration file remove that entry.\n\n*What does installing grub in /dev/sda or /dev/sdaX implies?\n\n\nA: First:\nConsider GPT instead of MBR partitions.\nIf you have the hardware for it (UEFI bios), and new enough OS's (win 10 or 8, linux OS after ~2014), consider using the new GPT partition scheme. \nSee Whats the difference between gpt and mbr when partitioning a drive\n\nSecond:\nChoose between grub or windows boot loader and stick with it. In your case, stick to the windows one, it will be easier. Despite this, I will answer below about grub as well, in case someone does want to know more.\n1) There is only one bootloader/grub/boot-partition needed, and it should be the primary/first/bootable partition; Either that or you use windows proprietary boot loader; Each linux does not have a /boot directory - directories work differently in linux; think of the /boot partition as a \"hidden D: drive\" that any linux can possibly load; Note: linux nor windows will effectively use that /boot partition... when you press the power button, the computers BIOS will first load that partition as a boot loader; then, the grub bootloader on that partition will kick off control to one of the OS's - the OS wont particularly know or care who handed it control\n2) Dont select that 350 MB partition as a new grub boot loader. You already have a bootloader: one that windows put there. That 350 MB partition was put there by windows, and I can tell in the picture because it is NTFS File System format. You dont necessarily need /boot directories in your linux OS's. \nMe on the other hand, I want a bootloader that is free (as in freedom) and that I can tweak and wont look windowsy. In that case, it is more complex and out of scope from this answer. Use the windows one if you just want it to work. To use grub, you may have to reinstall windows or use GPT, basically starting from a scratch disk, no OS already installed.\n3) If you use grub and stick to MBR partition tables (vs the new GPT), you will likely always run into trouble when upgrading windows. Start again from scratch with GPT, or use the windows boot loader.\n4) /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc are actually not effectively directories, so you are not installing grub TO those directories. Instead, you are saying to find those pieces of hardware, and install grub on them. /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc are how the linux operating system automatically keeps track of new pieces of hardware (disks in this case) that are found by the OS and loaded. So it would be like windows \"Disk 0\" or \"CD-ROM 0\" from the picture above. \n", "Q: How does DNS resolution work without any nameserver entries in resolv.conf? I have a query on the purpose of the resolv.conf file. \nIf I delete the name server entry from the /etc/resolv.conf file, my browser still able to do the DNS query. As far as I know, any URL is first looked up in the name server which is listed on this file. \nI read somewhere that if the resolv.conf entry is set to localhost then it means that the name server is running in the local host.

With a randomly generated key, I could find no way of doing this. I tried over 5 times to do it, but never succesful, I found online lots of articles about this problem but never found a working solution or an official one, and there is no other graphical tool that I could find that is able to deal with encrypted volumes. I tried using the command line without success. So and because I need to have my system up and running, I installed my system on a luks encrypted volume with no swap partition. Now I'm writing from my new system, I wan to create an encrypted SWAP with randomly generated key. How could I do that?, I need a complete solution please.\n\nA: I am in the same boat! As of yesterday I tried to install using an encrypted luks and of course it required me to create an encrypted swap.

I've installed a few openjdk-8-jre packages (including one w/\"headless\" in its name) but I haven't been able to get it to work in FF. I've seen a lot of other posts over this issue, but they tend to apply to earlier Javas (there is no \"libnpjp2.so\" for instance). Is it possible? and how?\nI'm running Lubuntu 14.04.2 i386.\n\nA: The plugin to run Java in a browser is called IcedTea. Currently, IcedTea only has Java 7 releases (the version 2 releases). Java 8 would correspond to a version 3 release, so until there's a version 3 release of IcedTea, you won't be able to run Java 8 in the browser.\n", "Q: Is there a calculator which supports arbitrary precision? I have got the standard gnome-calculator installed, but as I am dealing with rather large numbers at the moment, I need something more powerful which can actually deal with them without falling over. So for instance at the moment I need to convert this large binary value to decimal, but when using the standard Ubuntu calculator, I find that it is unable to even represent such a large number and simply falls over. I also found a number of online conversion tools which claimed to be able to deal with large numbers, but simply ended up crashing my browser and draining my CPU cores, and not actually giving me an answer, just an error message.\nSo really my question is, how can I convert and deal with such large numbers in Ubuntu without the tools simply falling over and not being able to deal with it? Can any body recommend me a tool which would be able to deal with such large numbers? Even by splitting the problem up by say calculating small numbers which make up the bigger one and then adding them together or something?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\n\nA: Conversion between bases in bc is fairly easy.

dont know why, my microphone volume is changing automaticly. In pavucontrol, I set my mic to 25% but when I start talking it changes to 50 %. Anyone got a solution on how to disable pavucontrol changing my mic volume?

I have a similar experience with my laptop when Skype is turned on. In your screen shots it looks like you use Skype as well. Maybe you can see if the problem disappears if you turn it off?\nEdit 1. In Skype's Options --> Sound uncheck the tick that allows Skype to automatically control the volume settings.\nEdit 2. If it is not Skype, I am afraid I do not know how to resolve this issue. In any case, is this question not a duplicate of \nHow to disable microphone from auto adjusting its input volume\nwhich after two years does not seem to be fully resolved.\n\nA: I think I have an answer for this, it worked on my machine and it's only a theory. I have three mics on my machine, one built into the desktop, one on the camera and another on my headset. I found that if one of the other mics picked up sound, it dropped the gain on the others. I disabled the camera mic and unplugged the desktop and the headset is working fine now.\nNot sure if this helps anyone, but thought it worth mentioning.\n", "Q: Ubuntu snappy docker ps not working When a run: \nsudo docker ps\n\nin ubuntu snappy i get this error:\nFATA[0000] Get http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.18/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: permission denied.

The only thing I found which made it possible to use docker again on snappy core, was to remove and reinstall the docker framework using the commands:\nsudo snappy remove docker\n\nfollowed by\nsudo snappy install docker\n\nAt that point I was able to run docker commands without incident. I found that my docker images were still available to me, and the ones started with the flag --restart always automatically restarted when the docker framework was reinstalled.\n", "Q: Skype crackling audio during Test Call?

This is done with the -I command\n  line switch (eg -I/gs/Resource).\n2) Use a TrueType font as a replacement. To do this you need to edit\n  gs/Resource/Init/cidfmap and add an entry for the font (Arial),\n  specifying the TrueType font to be used instead and some other\n  parameters. You must then also tell Ghostscritp [sic] to use the\n  specified file, again using the -I switch as above.\nYou can also use an existing CIDfont with a different name as a\n  replacement by specifying this in the cidfmap file.\nPlease refer to the documentation in :\n  /gs/doc/Use.htm\nLook for \"CID fonts\" and \"CID font substitution\".\n\nYou will have to apt-get install ghostscript-doc to get the file:///usr/share/doc/ghostscript-doc/Use.htm Ken refers to.\nThe file to update is /var/lib/ghostscript/fonts/cidfmap just add this line /WPMathA << /FileType /TrueType /Path (/usr/local/share/fonts/Wphv07na.ttf) /SubfontID 0 /CSI [(Identity) 0] >> ;\nAnd run gs -o embedeed-font.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dEmbedAllFonts=true -I/usr/local/share/fonts/Wphv06na.ttf no-embedded-font.pdf\nPlease read file:///usr/share/doc/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html for background information.

I want that all users have the following policy:\n\n\n*\n\n*must start with a CAPS-ON-Letter\n\n*Username must have minimum 5 letter and max 9 letters. \nfor ex. \"Newuser\" should be accepted, \"newuser\" not and \"Hereisanewuser\" neither! \nHow should I proceed? \n\nA: Use this:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z][[:alpha:]]{4,8}$\"\n\nThis will match [A-Z] at the start of the name and them the name can contain any alphabetic characters i.e. [A-Za-z] and the total characters would be between 5 to 9.\nOn the other hand if you want only lowercase letters after the first uppercase:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z][a-z]{4,8}$\"\n\nFurthermore if you want any number or any upper/lowercase (using character classes):\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z]([[:alpha:]]|[[:digit:]]){4,8}$\"\n\nUsing ranges:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z]([A-Za-z]|[0-9]){4,8}$\"\n\n\nA: There are correct answers already, and the answer I'm going to provide suggests in the end to do exactly what the other answers suggested to do already, so technically this is a duplicate, but I think that to give an explanation it's better here.\nNAME_REGEX=\"[A-Z]{1}[a-z]{5,9}$\"\n\nThis regex matches any string whose last part is a 6-10 character long substring starting with a capital letter, so it matches strings such as \"usErname\", \"USErname\", \"12Ername\".\nLeaving aside the fact that this is not something you're expecting, the fact that no username is being accepted is probably (and sorry for the probably, but /etc/adduser.conf is very poorly documented) due to the fact the regex must be anchored both at the start and at the end (the other possibility being you having been always testing using usernames not matching the above criterium).\nSo as it has been suggested already, first anchor the start of the string:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z]{1}[a-z]{5,9}$\"\n\nThen you can remove the number of occurences specifier {1} after the character class [A-Z], since by default a character class matches only one occurence:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z][a-z]{5,9}$\"\n\nThen you should decrement the minimum and maximum number of occurences in the number of occurences specifier {5,9} to 4 and 8, since you want to accept strings that are 5-9 characters long:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z][a-z]{4,8}$\"\n\n\nA: Tested this and it works.\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[A-Z][a-z]{4,8}$\"\n\nsimilar: regex-to-check-if-the-first-character-is-uppercase\n\nA: After testing several of the above regular expressions for NAME_REGEX with no success (html code is hiding some \\ characters, at least), I managed to write a proper and working one including the period symbol, just like this:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[a-z][-a-z0-9_\\.]*\\$?$\"\n\nThis means: Begin with a-z, followed by any number of dashes or a-z or 0-9 or underscores or periods, and may be ended with an optional $. \n(Note that even the default commented out configuration line in some Debian-based distributions' adduser.conf file, have the $ syntax wrong, just \\$ instead of \\$?$).\n", "Q: What is the command to open a specific directory in a new tab in nautilus?

Although the script is not actually faster (consider it is a work around, due to nautilus' lack of cli options) the script \"feels\" more \"crispy\". Fact remains however that the script simply needs to wait for the GUI to be ready for each next step, since it simulates user actions.

As a result, the timing \"inside\" the script is important. I set timing to \"safe\" values on my system, and made it \"smart\" if possible.

If no `nautilus window was opened, a new window will open in your home directory.\n\nA: (These sites drive me crazy with their weird requirements - this should be a comment, but I don’t have enough reputation and this kind of nonsense doesn’t encourage me to get it!)\nJacob’s answer does not work for paths with spaces in them.

So JSlint insalled but when i run jslint in the terminal I get this:\n`\nmodule.js:340\n    throw err;\n      ^\nError: Cannot find module 'readable-stream'\nat Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)\nat Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)\nat Module.require (module.js:364:17)\nat require (module.js:380:17)\nat Object.<anonymous> (/home/felipe/.npm/j slint/0.9.0/package/lib/stream.js:1:80)\nat Module._compile (module.js:456:26)\nat Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)\nat Module.load (module.js:356:32)\nat Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\nat Module.require (module.js:364:17)`\n\nso I ran sudo npm install -g readable-stream , to verify I looked in /home/me/.npm/ and there is indeed a readable-stream folder.

I would appreciate any help on trying to resolve this issue.\nI was trying to get JSLint to work on sublime text 3 by using package install --> JSLint and I also tried SublimeLinter but I've failled with all 3. I could always install brackets which  comes with JSLint by default but I'd like to get it to work in the terminal as well and possibly st3\n\nA: The problem seems to be happening here:\n/home/felipe/.npm/j slint/0.9.0/package/lib/stream.js:1:80\n\n(Not sure what that space is doing in j slint... maybe that's worth looking into?) If you look at the contents of that file, you should see something like this:\nmodule.exports = require('readable-stream');\n\nNothing too revolutionary there, but for some reason your setup seems to be failing to resolve that dependency. One thing you can do is install it manually inside the jslint folder:\ncd ~/.npm/jslint/0.9.0/package\nnpm install\n\nThis will find the package.json file inside the jslint directory and install all of its dependencies locally in a node_modules folder.\nIf that doesn't work, something is really broken. In that case, I'd be inclined to blame the Node.js packaging on Ubuntu and recommend you start over, using nvm to manage node.\n", "Q: 15.04: rsync connection refused I upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 this weekend.

But very soon, it will go off, although the NUM-Lock state did not change, i.e. I can still type numbers on the numpad. But the LED does not match the internal state. It may go off randomly, but usually directly within the first minute(s) after login.\nIf I hit NUM-Lock now, the LED stays off and the internal state toggles as expected to off as well, so the numpad works as arrow keys now and both LED and real status match. Hitting the key again will turn both LED and NUM-Lock on again, as one would expect it.\nSwitching TTYs (e.g. to TTY1 and back to TTY7) also \"repairs\" the inconsistency and the LED shines again, as expected.\nIs this random LED/real state mismatch a bug or how can I fix it?\n\nA: This seems to be a little bug - actually appearing in Ubuntu 15.10.\nIt happens when you start typing too early after booting the computer\n(especially when typing the root password ... after being asked to do so).\nIt also happens when you open an application with root privileges too early.  \nIt does not happen when you wait a few minutes or after the screen turns off when inactive.\nAs a workaround : either wait some time before starting to type or press the Num key twice.  \nI decided to file a bug report on Launchpad.  \nPlease may everybody reading this and having observed the same behaviour\nconfirm this bug to increase its importance and get it fixed quickly! Thank you. \nTo do this, click the link above, log into your launchpad account and click on:\nThis bug affects X people. Does this bug affect you? - Select \"Yes\".\n\nA: I am not sure about this, and it's not really a way to fix it but a hint where the problem might be:\nAround the time when I additionally installed xubuntu-desktop, the buggy misbehaviour of the NUM-Lock LED stopped. Probably something that got reconfigured or replaced during that process fixed the problem...\nSo please, as this is still a bug that must get fixed, go on confirming the bug report @cl-netbox wrote and linked in his answer above.

Every time I try to install it, though, I get to the 4th screen that says \"Installation type\" on the top, and it has the white box where you choose the partition but it is blank. There is a drop down box on the bottom but it only has /dev/sda. Also, I was never prompted with a screen asking whether to remove Windows, dual boot or \"something else\".

Also, I have tried different discs with different .iso files and they did the same thing. I have to hard reset my computer to reboot. Why is this happening?  \n\nA: It is completely normal for the partition manager to take a little time. You should not bother about that.

Any help?\nI created this question based on another answer-less, here is the link for more details on the original question.\n\nA: UPDATED: to reflect solution. \nI don't think that created a $HOME for your user.\nYou might want to run this too:\nsudo mkdir /home/hduser #if it doesn't exist\nsudo chown -R hduser:hadoop /home/hduser\n\nthen try logging in again.\n", "Q: Could sensors-detect have done anything bad to my machine I recently installed lm-sensors and ran the command (as instructed here):\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nBut then I read the man page on it which said:\nDESCRIPTION\n       sensors-detect is an interactive program that will walk you through the process of scanning your system for various hardware monitor‐\n       ing chips, or sensors, supported by libsensors(3), or more generally by the lm_sensors tool suite.\n\n       sensors-detect will look for the following devices, in order:\n\n       ·      Sensors embedded in CPUs, south bridges and memory controllers.\n\n       ·      Sensors embedded in Super I/O chips.\n\n       ·      Hardware monitoring chips accessed through ISA I/O ports.\n\n       ·      Hardware monitoring chips reachable over the SMBus or more generally any I2C bus on your system.\n\n       As the last two detection steps can cause trouble on some systems, they are normally not attempted if the second detection  step  led\n       to  the  discovery  of  a Super I/O chip with complete hardware monitoring features.  However, the user is always free to ask for all\n       detection steps if so is his/her wish. This can be useful if a given system has more than one hardware monitoring chip. Some  vendors\n       are known to do this, most notably Asus and Tyan.\n\nAnd:\nWARNING\n       sensors-detect needs to access the hardware for most of the chip detections.  By definition, it doesn't know which  chips  are  there\n       before  it  manages  to identify them. This means that it can access chips in a way these chips do not like, causing problems ranging\n       from SMBus lockup to permanent hardware damage (a rare case, thankfully.)\n\n       The authors made their best to make the detection as safe as possible, and it turns out to work just fine in most cases,  however  it\n       is  impossible  to  guarantee that sensors-detect will not lock or kill a specific system. So, as a rule of thumb, you should not run\n       sensors-detect on production servers, and you should not run sensors-detect if can't afford replacing a random part of  your  system.\n       Also, it is recommended to not force a detection step which would have been skipped by default, unless you know what you are doing.\n\nBut as I had not really been warning when I was running the first last part, I ran it, and the result was:\nProbing for `National Semiconductor LM78' at 0x290...       No\nProbing for `National Semiconductor LM79' at 0x290...       No\nProbing for `Winbond W83781D' at 0x290...                   No\nProbing for `Winbond W83782D' at 0x290...                   No\n\nAlthough the second last part properly warned me so I did not run it. But the fact that it says No for the first last one, does this mean anything, or is there any way of telling at all (other than waiting) whether any damage was done to my system? Would the program have indicated at all if something bad had happened? Or is there any way of checking?\nI have got a Lenovo B590.\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\n\nA: It appears running the last part of sensors-detect can overwrite values in an EPROM controlling the LCD display on some laptops. If your display looks fine there is no damage.\nSee Archwiki sensors-detect discussion for more details.\n", "Q: Openstack Trusty:Kilo \"Error: Unable to retrieve security groups\" Trying to setup a 3-node openstack Kilo, based on trusty:kilo charms.

I have two hard drives, with two corresponding Grubs. One is from Arch Linux, and the other is from Ubuntu. Using Arch's grub, I can boot into either distribution. However, using Ubuntu's grub, I can see both Arch and Ubuntu, but cannot boot into Arch. I get the error:\nKernel offset\nEnd kernel panic. Not syncing: VFS.\nUnable to mount root fs on unknown-block.\n\nI compared grub.cfg for both distributions. In Ubuntu's grub, I can see an entry for Arch, with the following line.\ninitrd /boot/intel-ucode.img\n\nI changed it to follow Arch's grub.cfg:\ninitrd /boot/intel-ucode.img /boot/initramfs-linux.img\n\nNow I can boot into Arch from Ubuntu's grub. It appears that Ubuntu is not appending this required option by default. How can I make Ubuntu automatically create the correct entry?\nEdit\nI'm updating Arch's grub with grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. In Ubuntu, I've tried both update-grub and the raw command above (which it is aliased to).\nEdit 2\nThe uncommented lines of /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"saved\"\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=\"true\"\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=\"true\"\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=\"3\"\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=\"`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\n\nA: Actually, there are two files that need to be modified to solve this problem.

I'm a relatively new Ubuntu user and would like to use the latest version of PHP 5.6 and Apache 2.4\nI've been using the latest versions of Apache and PHP on Windows without any problems for a few years now, but I'm switching to Ubuntu since they provide better performance.\nI've noticed that the versions in Ubuntu are older, I've read some tutorials and some people recommended to install Ondřej Surý PPA's.\nI've read that PPA's can contain malicious software and such, and since I'm not familiar with his PPA's I'm asking for advice about (his) PPA's on here.\nI've read that he is an official maintainer for some of the Debian packages.\nI was wondering if his packages for Ubuntu have a big user share and if they are safe to use. (e.g. is there anyone else that contributes to his PPA's or that checks for possible malicious code)\nNote: I don't want to suggest he can't be trusted or anything, but I'm just curious and careful ;) \nAdditionally since Debian keeps up with the latest versions of Apache and PHP I'm considering switching to that, since it has more people contributing and using their packages.\nI know how to use the command line and the text editor nano quite well (I run Ubuntu server after all ;)\nMy question is, how hard is it to switch to Debian? Is it comparable to running ubuntu server, as in I install software with apt-get and configure it with a text editor? or is it more like having to edit source code and compile stuff my self?\n\nA: The safest place to get the software you seek would be from the Ubuntu Repositories (as for PHP and Apache, Security Patches are applied by the Security Team to all the releases where a security issue exists), or directly from the upstream projects by downloading the source code in a tarball and compiling it.\nOn Ubuntu, the PPAs from Ondrej for the PHP versions are actually OK to use.  Ondrej is one of the maintainers for the Debian package and also the Ubuntu package as a result of his Debian efforts, and he has worked on Ubuntu bugs at times in PHP5 as well (Debian QA page for php5 where Ondrej is listed in the maintainers and uploaders).  His PPAs are safe to use, and in fact on some systems I use them in production still when I need the older versions of PHP.  (Or in rare cases, I backport the latest from Debian myself, but I'm a power user so...)\nHowever, the only true 'trusted' way to get the latest software is to download the latest source code and compile it yourself for everything.  Your next 'trusted' way is to use the repositories for the OS you have (such as Ubuntu, which the Security Team will provide patches and updates for via the security repositories for Ubuntu to keep security holes patched up).\n\nUbuntu is actually derived from Debian, such that it operates much the same as a Debian system would with a wide number of changes.  The only way to get the 'latest and greatest' PHP and Apache is to use Debian Unstable provided the package maintainers are extremely current on releasing updates (which usually is NOT the case given Debian freezes and such, just like Ubuntu has).\n", "Q: Shutdown just logging out I have an older hp pavilion all in one pc and after upgrading to 15.04 whenever I tell the computer to shutdown while in unity (haven't tried other DEs) it goes to the login screen as if I'd only pressed logout.

On this I have installed a VirtualBox with Ubuntu Server 12.04. OpenVPN is installed on both.\nI need to allow internet on Ubuntu and I also need to connect to a VPN. The Windows [Host Machine] is also connected through openVPN.\nWindows has a network adapter with internet connection and receives IP through DHCP. The adapter TAP is created by openVPN.\nHow I can configure Ubuntu to allow internet (in and out) and you can still be connected to the VPN?\n*The server openVPN is out of the network\n\nA: If you use the default NAT configuration for your guest (Ubuntu) in vbox, it will use the OpenVPN connection of your host without any configuration in the guest.\nHowever, if you use \"Bridged network\" for your guest in vbox, you will need to configure OpenVPN in your guest also.\n\nA: \nI need that Ubuntu has internet and also can connect to the VPN using VirtualBox adapters installed in Windows. –  Ale  (from comments above)\n\nWelcome to the networking hell of VPNs and Virtual Machines.  You have two things you want to achieve:  You want Ubuntu to be able to go out to the internet, but to also be able to use the VPN.  You have a big problem: You cannot achieve both at the same time.  The nature of VPN networking is that all data gets routed through the VPN.  With the VPN existing on the Windows host, that means anything going over the Windows connection via the Virtual NAT adapter will be subject to that routing as well.\nYou'll have to investigate the policies of the network that your Windows system is on (EXCLUDING the VPN part) to follow this recommendation, and check the compatibility of your network equipment with 'Bridged' mode in VBox, but the sorta-simplest option is to add a second virtual network adapter and hook it up to \"Bridged adapter\" and have that set to the network card you want to be 'acted' as (or in laymans terms, the network card which is what your host system communicates with the LAN over, so either wireless or ethernet depending on the networking method).  That way, you have a non-VPN'd 'connection' via whatever the standard network is that your computer is connected to, separate from the NAT'd (VPN'd) connection.\nThe tricky part is this: You have to know VirtualBox enough to be able to manually disable one network connection and enable the other on the VM's hardware controls to switch between them.  One would be NAT out over the Windows computer and would go over the VPN when the Windows computer is connected to the VPN.  The other would be Bridged Network out onto the network that your Windows computer is connected to directly without going over the VPN.  However, you have to do a lot more manual work to achieve this.\n", "Q: Dual booting windows/ubuntu not showing windows I had Windows 7 installed on my PC and tried to install Ubuntu 14.04.

If so, do I need to install Windows again from a CD? I did create a backup image of my computer with Macrium Reflect before installing Ubuntu, but I did not create a recovery DVD. \n\nA: It looks like you did, indeed, format your hard drive and install Ubuntu over everything. You're going to have to reinstall Windows, but it's going to be tricky. Use Gparted in Ubuntu to make a new NTFS partition. Install Windows to this partition. Once that's done, Ubuntu won't be able to boot, so you'll need to use the boot-repair program to fix that.

I was using dd to copy a disk image onto an SD card for a Raspberry PI, but managed to copy the image onto /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdc.  Problem now is, of course, that I've nuked the entire MBR and directory structure of the hard drive. I've reconfigured with a new drive, and this time I've dual booted the thing and taken a copy of the MBR so that if the same thing happens again, it will only clobber windows.  \nWhat I want to know is, is there any way at all to recover the file system once the first few GB of the hard drive have been overwtitten? I can use photorec to recover the files, but I think what I have is more a large collection of file fragments.  I'd really like to recover the directory structure if I can.\n\nA: In this case I'd simply retrieve all your files from your backups.  ;)\nOverwriting the first few GB of a partition will have wiped out enough of the filesystem's structure that it is unlikely you will be able to retrieve file metadata in a meaningful way.\nNow, since you did it to the entire drive (/dev/sda) it is possible that you have intact partitions that start after the part that you wiped, that could be 100% restored.  In this case you can run testdisk to search for the lost partitions and restore them to the partition table, then you should be able to read and write them as normal.\nMost likely, however, you will have overwritten the start of a partition you really wanted, and you will be stuck using photorec which searches through what's left and finds non-fragmented files by their file signature.\nOne tip about how I use photorec: set it only to identify the file types you most want, and don't be afraid to run it multiple times with different/more file types selected each time.  This may decrease the chances that something will be mis-identified (some files may identify as more than one type).  I don't know how effective that actually is, but I do it.  My most frequent reason for using photorec is when someone I know has a corrupted, or accidentally formatted, memory card for their camera, or something, so I narrow down the file types it's looking for to just JPEG/M2TS/MOV or whatever types of files the camera takes.\n", "Q: Standard ubuntu 15.04 won't boot, but ubuntu (upstart) does I understand that Ubuntu switched to systemd recently from upstart.\nUbuntu started on the first boot, I installed cinnamon and made a change to grub.cfg in attempt to get my USB 3.0 Ports working, making me thing that the grub.cfg change is the culprit.\nNow I need to select Ubuntu with linux [version] (upstart) to get it to boot.\nI can provide any logs/lshw/[whatever].

Guys as u can see I want to install Ubuntu,not dual boot.\nMy question is when I select Replace windows with Ubuntu,will it delete all my data (complete hard disk format) or just windows 7 data (my C: drive) ??????????????\n\nA: Yes, it will.\nWindows holds all your data in one big partition, which occupies the whole drive (more or less) - this needs to be removed as a single item, so your data will go.\nSave it to a removable drive?\n\nA: It would be a better choice to select 'something else' and then when the installer asks for a location to install the root partition, just choose the C: drive. You will not lose data on any other drives (but will completely wipe out any data on C: such as Documents, Pictures, files/folders on Desktop, etc.) if you follow this procedure. See this answer for more information.\n\nA: Yes it will, as opposed to dual boot or 'something else'. \nIf you are an Ubuntu \"newbie\" there are a few great options on trying ubuntu without deleting windows all together. \nIf the OP does not like a dual boot, visualization of windows is a great option if you wish to keep some windows functionality for specific programs. \nI would suggest 4gig of Ram for this to be most effective on a 64bit Ubuntu OS. \nA great guide for this is VM Windows on Ubuntu \n", "Q: Apt wants to remove ubuntu-mate-desktop To preface my question, I already know about this question, but it doesn't have any answers (plus it's for an older version), so I'm opening this one, because this is becoming a pretty big issue for me.\nI have 2 applications on Ubuntu MATE 15.04 that I want to remove; Firefox and apport.

If you remove one of the former, the latter will also be removed.\nubuntu-mate-desktop is a meta-package, enclosing the set of packages that make up the Mate DE. apport and apport-gtk are part of this set, meaning they are deemed core components of this DE.

Is there a way to disable the auto dim function of the Ubuntu Phone (14.10 r22)?\nEven though I can disable the auto-brightness function and set the screen timeout to 10 minutes (or never) the screen of my phone is dimmed after a minute of inactivity - meaning NO TOUCH of the screen... This is annoying when watching youtube.\n\nA: Preparation: If you haven't done so already, install the Terminal app.\nIn the Terminal write:\n$ dconf write /com/ubuntu/touch/system/dim-timeout \"@u 0\"\n\nThe dim-timeout Key wants an unsigned int as a value. That's what the @u is for. The number stands for the seconds after the screen is dimmed (0 = infinite).\n(Since the setting is stored for the local user (phablet), it's not nessecary to make the root file system writeable.)\n(Tested on the Ubuntu tablet, with Ubuntu Touch 15.04.)\n\nA: The auto dim is controlled by the donf key /com/ubuntu/touch/system/dim-timeout. You can set the timeout to 0 (= infinite) by executing this command in a terminal:\n$ dconf write /com/ubuntu/touch/system/dim-timeout 0\n\nThe dconf database for the default user phablet is used for brightness control, not the root database, so do you should execute the command as phablet.\n\nThe above should work, but I had to remount the root file system writable and play with the brightness in the system settings app until it worked, but I don't know why or what happened exactly. Remounting the root file system writable is done (as root).\n# remount -o remount,rw /\n\nYou can lock it against writing again by rebooting.

Using the same regex as above, this script will attempt to replace everything on the line with the part of it that matches the regex.

Note though that this is different for different setups. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I disable MoinMoin such that MediaWiki will start working again I have installed MoinMoin (MM) on my 32 bit Ubuntu 15.04 installation, by following this guide. It worked well, but now I can't access my MediaWiki (MW) installation (version 1.24.1 if relevant) through my web browser via localhost (127.0.0.1), as whenever I try I access MM instead. If possible I'd like to keep MoinMoin on my PC (it'd be nice if in your answer you could tell me how to start it again, if this is possible) but if necessary to use MW again I'd be willing to remove it from Ubuntu. \n\nA: In the guide I used there was an instruction to add the following lines to the end of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:\n#\n#  MoinMoin WSGI configuration\n#\n# you will invoke your moin wiki at the root url, like http://servername/FrontPage:\nWSGIScriptAlias /   /usr/local/share/moin/moin.wsgi\n\n# create some wsgi daemons - use these parameters for a simple setup\nWSGIDaemonProcess moin user=www-data group=www-data processes=5 threads=10 maximum-requests=1000 umask=0007\n\n# use the daemons we defined above to process requests!\nWSGIProcessGroup moin\n<Directory \"/usr/local/share/moin\">\n    Options All\n    AllowOverride All\n    Require all granted\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nsimply adding # to the start of them (making them recognized by apache as comments not instructions to follow) gets MoinMoin disabled and MediaWiki back to functioning normally. To get MoinMoin back simply remove the added hashtags. \n", "Q: DNS Issue in ubuntu 14.04 I am facing DNS resolving issue sometimes in my Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS trusty.\nI have configured my system with network manager to work with static IP assignment.

Or, of course a DoS attack but I do not think my server is that important... \nThe program is just for learning purposes and shall not be used by any clients/hackers(of course ;)) but you never now..\nSo, can anyone tell me if it is possible to directly create a file receivedData with a limited file size. At the moment it reaches the file size it should deny receivedData preventing it from causing an OOM.\nIf not I will need to implement that into the java program...\n\nA: UPDATE:\nThe answer by muru is perfect for file size, I'm here giving a solution how to size a directory itself, not just a file.\n\nThere is no such thing direct since filesystem deal with a folder as file of files and its limit is the whole filesystem itself.\nSo as a workaround for your problem you can do a trick creating a virtual filesystem and mount it on a specific (empty) directory. \ncreate the mount point of the virtual file system to mount on (~/test for me) \nmkdir ~/test\n\ncreate a file full of /dev/zero, large enough to the maximum size you want to reserve for the virtual filesystem  (i'm doing here for 1MB) \ndd if=/dev/zero of=test.img bs=1024 count=0 seek=1024\n\nformat this file with an ext4 filesystem\n mke2fs test.img\n\nmount the newly formatted disk space in the directory you've created as mount point\nmount -o loop test.img ~/test\n\nThen use this directory\n\nA: I'd say it's safest to check the file size inside the java program.\nYou can append to any file you have write access to, as long as there is enough space in the partition, so you cannot limit a file's size directly.\nThe only thing I can think of is to create a partition only for this file, so the file size will be limited to the partition's size. Also, if you'd format the partition as FAT32, the file could have a maximum size of 4 GiB.\n\nA: There are two ways this can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*using the ulimit shell utility, or using the setrlimit system call (which is what ulimit calls in turn). \n\n*using filesystem quotas, and a special user for the server process, will restrict the total usage of that user\n\n\n\nulimit/setrlimit\nFrom man 2 setrlimit:\nRLIMIT_FSIZE\n      The maximum size of files that the process may create.  Attempts\n      to extend a file beyond this  limit  result  in  delivery  of  a\n      SIGXFSZ  signal.   By default, this signal terminates a process,\n      but a process can catch this signal instead, in which  case  the\n      relevant  system  call  (e.g., write(2), truncate(2)) fails with\n      the error EFBIG.\n\nI'm not sure how one could invoke the setrlimit function from Java, but this U&L question might help. Alternatively, wrap the Java server in a script:\n#! /bin/bash\nulimit -f 1073741824   # 1GB\njava ....\n\n\nFilesystem Quotas:\nI'm assuming an ext4 filesystem, I'm unsure about others. First, we need to enable quota on the filesystem. Edit /etc/fstab, and add usrquota to the mount options of the appropriate partition. If we're doing this for /, for example, the final entry would look something like:\nUUID=... /               ext4    errors=remount-ro,usrquota 0       1\n\nThen enable it after restarting:\nsudo quotaon /\n\nI'll assume your server is run as a different user (say restricted_user). If not, create one if you don't want your normal processes to be affected.\nThen do:\nsudo edquota restricted_user\n\nWhich will open an editor. \nDisk quotas for user restricted_user (uid 1001):\n  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard\n  /dev/sdd1                   1087940    943718   1048576       9956        0        0\n\nSet the soft and hard limits to the appropriate values (they're  1024-byte blocks, so divide your limit by 1024). Save and quit.\nThen the user will not be able to exceed a total of 1G usage on that filesystem, counting all files owned by them.\n\nNaturally, you should still check the size in your server program.\n\nA: Without seeing your code, it's hard to tell if your application would OOM or not.\nUsually, you would read a manageable chunk of data (say 1MB) from the socket and write that chunk of data directly to a file. That way, you'd never store more than the temporary chunk in memory at any one time.\nTypically this looks like:\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"receivedData\");\n\nInputStream is = clientSocket.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint read;\nwhile((read = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    fos.write(buffer);\n};\n\nYou could then add a counter to the while loop to count how many bytes have been written to the file and terminate the socket should it go over a predetermined amount or is getting close to consuming all available disk space.\n", "Q: Something is using my camera on Ubuntu 14.04.2 My camera is always active and it shuts down(led on camera) when I open-close cheese web-camera program.

Now I want to upgrade from PHP 5.4 to the 5.5 version. I do I update only Php without having to re-install LAMPP again?\n\nA: Edit: Just read the title to the end and noticed you're on 12.10! Upgrade! Upgrade immediately! You are literally years behind on security updates.\nActually, it's probably easier to just do a fresh install of 14.04 (a LTS version, see below) than upgrading to 13.04 (dead), 13.10 (dead) and then to 14.04. And not meaning to scare you, but there have been some pretty serious security issues that you haven't been protected against; your install could already be exploited.\nThe below was written assuming you were using 14.04.\n\nFor standard PHP installations, I would recommend just hopping to the ondrej/php5 PPA. This is a repository maintained by Ondřej Surý (a Debian PHP packager) and this PPA tracks the Debian PHP team's work. It should be as good as what you get from Ubuntu directly.\nsudo apt install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install php5\n\nThat said, if you're using LAMPP, all bets are off. LAMPP is a completely unneccessary and separate packaging of components that I would never suggest be used for production. Use Ubuntu's (or Ondřej's) version. It's maintained and updated in a predictable way.\nThere's also a comment on your question that you upgrade to a later release of Ubuntu. If you're on 14.10, sure that dies in July, but if you're on 14.04, well, 14.04 is a Long Term Support release and is maintained up to 2019. 15.04 barely gets you to 2016. That means fewer upgrades, less maintenance for you, and a lot less testing.\nSo my final suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stay on Install an LTS release\n\n*Install the proper LAMP stack that Ubuntu ships\n\n*Use Ondřej's PPA to hop to the latest stable PHP version (5.5 now).\n\n", "Q: Make it so files can't be recovered I have a laptop with 1 TB hdd which I am selling.

The wipe is going to take time. It has to write to every sector on the disk. A few extra GB for the installation won't make much of a difference.

I really like the animations in GNOME, but I it is really laggy when closing the applications and workspace overview. I read somewhere that this is caused by not caching the menu items. Is there a way to make that happen so that the menu will close properly? Or is their a way to disable or reduce the time of the fade out animation?\n\nA: Since GNOME 3.8 there is an explicit option to disable animations, you can change with gconf editor, or simply issue this from terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false\n\nAlso if this is not enough for you or you PC, you can enhace the responsiveness of UI by reducing the animation time:\nsudo nano /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/overview.js\n\nChange the ANIMATION_TIME to 0.001\nconst ANIMATION_TIME = 0.001;\n\n", "Q: Why does my ubuntu 14.10 have an issue when logging out?

This is likely because each comes with a variety of packages that do similar things, and thus will be competing for resources, and/or conflicting with each other.

I use notepad++ from Wine.\nI want to set Notepad++ as one of the default editors. I tried to set it by right-clicking on a file, then Open With. But I did not see Notepad++ in the resulting list (even after clicking on Choose Other Programs).\n\nA: You can use the  mimeopen command\nUsing a  terminal go to a folder containing some extension you want to open with notpadd++(here i'm testing for txt files)\nmimeopen -d file.txt\n\nYou will get a popup menu, where you can see some options, if you don't find notepad++ with them choose other and indicate your notepad++ .\nAlso you may interested in reading Change all associations from gedit to another application\n\nA: I guess the best advanced option gives you Ubuntu Tweak tool.\n \nHere you can set your default (desired) app to any format/extension.\nMore detailed described here\n\nA: Instead of using Notepad++ through Wine, you can directly install Notepadqq in Ubuntu. You can consider it as Ubuntu version of Notepad++.\nNotepadqq can be installed as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:notepadqq-team/notepadqq\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install notepadqq\nsudo apt-get install notepadqq-gtk\n\n\nA: I have followed the below steps and that exactly made me to fix this issue and made Notepad++ as the default editor in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once after installing Notepad++ using WINE, copy the file \"Notepad++.desktop\"  under, \"/.local/share/applications/wine/programs/Notepad++\"\n\n*We need to paste the copied file \"Notepad++.desktop\" in the below path\n\"/usr/share/applications\"\nNOTE: The applications folder is write protected by default. So open the terminal and navigate to \"/usr/share\" path and execute the following command.\nsudo chmod -R 777 applications\nOnce after copying the \"Notepad++.Desktop\" file, revert back this permission change made by the following command.\nsudo chmod -R 555 applications\n\n\n*Now, we need to make changes in the configuration file that exists in the gnome folder [which is a subfolder inside \"etc\" folder]\n\n\nNote: Again here, the gnome folder is write protected by default so, open the terminal and navigate to \"/usr/share\" path and execute the following command.\nsudo chmod -R 777 gnome\n\n\n*Now open the \"defaults.list\" file inside gnome folder and replace gedit by Notepad++. You can also individually set Notepad++ as default application for certain type of file. \n\n\nFor example, if you want to edit only plain text files in Notepad++, n the \"defaults.list\" file find for \"text/plain\" and you will get a line as follows,\ntext/plain=gedit.desktop\nNow replace the gedit bu Notepad++ so that, it would set the Notepad++ as default application for the plain text. The modified line should look like,\ntext/plain=Notepad++.desktop\nNow, SAVE the file once this change is done and close the file.\n[You can find a new file name defaults.list.xxxx has been created, which is nothing but the backup of old settings and you can very well delete it. Please make sure you are not deleting the other two files namely : \"defaults.list.dpkg-old\" and \"menus.blacklist\" ]\nOnce doing the required changes, revert back the permission change made earlier for the gnome folder by the following command.\nsudo chmod -R 555 gnome\n\n\n*That's it...

The disk worked fine as a disk, but when present, grub would freeze when accessing it in any way, even just tab completion on the grub command line!  My BIOS did not allow selecting which disk to have first in boot order, and the caddy disk had precedence.  Changing the BIOS presence/absence of a CD drive did not help.  I had Ubuntu on both disks.  \n\nOops, found some old notes, couldn't run off the caddy, needed to find a workaround to boot the first disk, then use the disk in the caddy.\n This meant that I could only run the Ubuntu on the internal disk only if grub avoided the caddy disk completely!\nA workaround is to boot off something like USB you can put before the hard disk(s).  I could set grub up to run the installation on the internal harddisk, avoiding any reference to the caddy, and that succeeded. The caddy disk may then be mounted and accessed in a normal second disk fashion. There may be other grub modules to include which might fix the problem, but I didn't find anything which worked.\n\nA: When going through the interface for installing Ubuntu (after booting the setup form either a USB dirve or CD), you should be able to select \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1\". You should be able to select the installation drive as well.\n", "Q: Opening Macintosh Pages files in Ubuntu I am switching from Macintosh. I want to know if there is an easy way to bulk convert files created by the word processor Pages into something Ubuntu can run. Open Office for example. \nAny advice appreciated.\n\nA: There don't appear to be a lot of Pages to OpenDocument Text converters, but luckily there are lots of Pages to Word Document converters, and LibreOffice can read Word documents. I suggest using this website here: https://cloudconvert.com/pages-to-docx.\nIt allows you to upload multiple documents securely and convert them to a Word document which LibreOffice can read. Later, you can convert them to OpenDocument Text inside of LibreOffice if you wish.\nBe warned that if your documents have lots of complex formatting then this may get lost when converting between files.\n\nA: It would be easier to convert the documents in Pages, if possible, to a more widely readable formats:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenDocument Format (.odt) so they can be opened in Libre/OpenOffice - may not be supported\n\n*XML Office etc (.doc/.docx) - this can be imported into Libreoffice and in MS office . If can't do ODF probably the next best thing.\n\n*PDF -  should mean that all the formatting etc is presevered, but it is  \n\n\nIf you don't currently have access to pages, there are various file converters available (e.g. ZamZar) that may work. The problem here is that it is likely to be a proprietary file format, so it probably is not open-able in other programs. If it is, it may have issues with formatting, missing/misplaces bits etc\nIf you have no luck converting the files, you may be able to recover some of the document by making a copy, changing the extension to .zip, and extracting it. You should be able to get the text out of the xml files inside - you may also find a PDF file: [1] [2] \nN.B. Ubuntu and other Linux systems often now come with Libreoffice instead of OpenOffice - it is basically the same, for the pro and cons see here.\n", "Q: How to reset ubuntu to default display settings after failed nVidia driver install attempt? This is the same dreaded story in Ubuntu with nVidia drivers ... I got a new machine with the K2200 nVidia card in it and now I'm unable to boot again after installing the latest nVidia drivers for this card. This machine is behind a heavy secured proxy and I need to do a lot of trial error before getting internet and the latest update version of trusty 14.04, but for this I also needed a desktop up and running therefore I installed the nVidia driver from its download site.\nI would like to reset back the display settings to default or minimal display to have a working environment. How can I do that? Note I have done several attempts and the backup settings may be gone.\nUPDATE (1) \nTo install the nVidia driver I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the driver of Quadro K2200 from a different machine\n\n*copy it into a USB drive\n\n*Install the driver in the new machine.\n\n\nUPDATE (2)\nI managed to run \n$ sudo ./NVIDIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --uninstall\n\nit acknowledged that nVidia was successfully uninstalled but still I still see no desktop after boot just the black screen of voidness. \n\nA: *\n\n*From the black screen where the computer has stopped when booting it, open a text-only virtual console by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F3.\n\n*At the login: prompt type your username and press Enter.\n\n*At the Password: prompt type your user password and press Enter.\n\n*Now you are logged in to a text-only console, and you can run terminal commands from the console. In this example, assume that you have downloaded an NVIDIA driver file called /NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.72.run from the official NVIDIA website to your Downloads folder and installed it.  \ncd ~/Downloads ## change directory to the location of the graphics driver that you downloaded from the official NVIDIA website\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.72.run --uninstall   \nsudo reboot   \n\nReplace the location and driver name in the above commands with the location and name of the driver that you installed. If you can't remember the name of the graphics driver file that you installed, use the ls command to list the contents of the directory where the graphics driver file that you downloaded is located.\nWhen you reboot the computer it will be using the Nouveau default open source graphics driver that is built-in in Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you can get into system console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1, then login there and run\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nIf you can't, then boot to recovery mode using grub menu, choose \"root\" option and run there:\nmount -o remount,rw /\napt-get purge nvidia*\nreboot\n\nThis is applicable to cases, when you installed Nvidia drivers normal way, using apt-get.\nIf you installed them according to some bad manuals with blacklisting nouveau and running a file downloaded from Nvidia site, it is another case. \nThe easiest way to uninstall Nvidia drivers is to run same file like that\n./nvidia-xxxxxxxx.run --uninstall\n\nAnd if you blacklisted nouveau, then you need to revert that too.\n", "Q: SSL for Apache2 Ubuntu Wordpress PLEASE HELP i need direction Hi i have ubuntu as a webserver and have loaded wordpress on there already.\nHowever when implementing SSL (bought from godaddy), the https only works for the homepage https://www.myexample.com but not the other links to the site such as \"about us\" https://www.myexample.com/about-us it gives :\n404 NOT FOUND\n\nThe requested URL /about-us/ was not found on this server.\n\nApache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at www.myexample.com Port 443\n\nI'm not sure what im doing wrong ? \nI have already tried a few things in the default-ssl.conf file. \n\nA: It's probably way too late, but I experienced the exact same issue when trying to install my self signed SSL certificate on my virtual host tonight.\nI followed the instructions provided by digitalocean and it worked very well.

You probably need to update your system to receive it:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\ndist-upgrade differs from upgrade in that it updates packages that might otherwise be 'held back', which sometimes includes the kernel. Currently, you are using the latest 3.13 kernel, which will still get security updates, but you'll have to dist-upgrade to get 3.16.\nOn Ubuntu 15.04, however, the latest version available on Ubuntu is 3.19. If you're using Ubuntu 15.04, again, update using the above method.\nIf you want to use the very latest mainline kernels, you can download them from here - scroll to the bottom to find the latest version. However, you should not do this on a production computer, because these can be more buggy and could break your system.\nYou will also have to manually update these every time, because there's no automatic update method.

(The idea seems to be that the “file I've opened”, i.e. the symlink, has not in fact changed.)\nShort of manually looking up the link location, one way to circumvent this issue is to have Bash do it on the command line:\n$ evince $(readlink link-to-example.pdf)\n\nor more generally\n$ evince $(realpath link-to-example.pdf)\n\n", "Q: Gcc expert 24 vinyl cutter my friend had a gift: Gcc expert 24 vinyl cutter without drivers installation cd or serial cable, only usb cable and power chord.\nItryed with inkscape/inkcut and everythings looks fine but the \"plotter\" doesen't respond.\nInformation about it on the net are all for windows, did any linux user get this plotter work ?\nThe tuxplot / cutplot mention this device as working  as parallel peripheral.\nThanks to anyone who point me to the right direction, i followed \"plotter no ubunut\" tutorial with no results, but should be a lot more software that should be able to make this work.\nThanks.\n\nA: According to product details this plotter speaks HPGL, so the inkcut extension to Inkscape should work.\nJust install the plotter via CUPS at localhost:631, as make choose \"raw\".\nThe USB connection should show up automatically.\nIf not, check lpinfo -v |grep usb: as they do:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/26329186/creating-a-raw-printer-queue-in-cups-host-and-adding-them-through-cups-client\nInstall the inkcut extension to inkscape\nI used this:\nhttp://inkcut.sourceforge.net/\nI don't know how it relates to that:\nhttps://github.com/codelv/inkcut\nwould be interesting, though...\n\nA: Have some problems vith GCC Expert II.

My Sony VAIO Laptop has a feature which will allow me to keep one USB port powered even when my laptop is shut down. It is given in the manual here. It can be switched on or off from the Vaio software which came with pre-installed Windows.\nIn the past, when I was dual booting with Windows, I could enable it by booting into Windows, and it would stay on, even after using Ubuntu several times. For some reason it stopped working recently. But I don't have Windows anymore, and would like to re-enable it from Ubuntu. It would be fun if I could switch it on manually from Linux. I digged a lot on google, especially for information on my motherboard(HannStar J MV-6 94V-0), and came up with its schematics in a Vietnamese site. I specifically mentions USB charging. But I am having no idea as to how to use the information.\nLot of people are suggesting that it can be enabled from the BIOS, but I have checked again and do not see anything in the BIOS. But I also observed that BIOS has very few fields, making me suspect that BIOS features might be hidden. I will try to unlock them. In the mean time, output of dmidecode is appended towards end of the question.\nI don't know if this feature requires special hardware support, but anyways it is possible on my machine. Smart phones tend to go low on battery fast, and you could always connect it to the laptop in your bag, and charge it on the move when you are in college or traveling.

To make life easier, you should either mount certain directories of the clients from a central location, or use a remote interface, such as SSH or VNC. Else, you'll have to apply each setting 40 times.\nPrinting\nThe easiest and safest way would be to use another computer as a print server, which itself connects to all required print servers. By doing so, you can change the printer configuration on one host only. If you can't manage to get one, you could instead use one of the 40 workstations as a server additionally.\nLinux uses the Common Unix Printing System CUPS. It's by default installed on the desktop version of Ubuntu, and you'll have the option to install it on the server edition on installation time. If you already installed the server, you can install CUPS with the command sudo apt-get install cups\nBy default, the CUPS server only works when accessed locally. To change that, open the file /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and replace the loopback entry by one referencing the hostname, i.e. replace\nListen 127.0.0.1:631\n\nby\nListen <hostname>:631\n\nYou can get the hostname with the hostname command. If the server has a firewall (I'll assume ufw in the following), you may have to open port 631 to the outside:\nsudo ufw allow cups\n\nAlso, enable publishing the printers on the network:\nBrowsing on\n\nTo apply these changes, restart CUPS:\nsudo service cups restart\n\nNow, you can use set up all printers via the server's desktop (if it has one) or the CUPS interface at http://<ServerIP>:631/. When asked for authentication on the web interface, use your root or admin user credentials.\n\nIf you have network capable printers, there are chances that CUPS will find them on its own, and all you need to do is to add them to the printer list in CUPS. If some printers aren't found, you should be able to use their IP address to connect to them. When installing a printer, make sure that CUPS will publish them on the server.\nIf your printers aren't network capable, and only support e.g. USB, attach them to the print server and install them there. Again make sure that the printers are published by CUPS.\nTo tell the clients that there is a print server, open or create the file /etc/cups/client.conf on each of them.\nIt would be much easier to mount certain directories from a NAS server (maybe the one that runs the CUPS server), so as to keep certain configuration centralized, but that would go beyond the scope of this answer.\nIn each client.conf, add the following line, replacing ServerIP by its actual IP, and ensure the server got a static IP (in the Router's settings).\nServerName <ServerIP>\n\nNow, you have to restart CUPS on the client systems, using the same command as described above.\nIn the clients's printer settings, or CUPS web interface, add the printers from the CUPS server.\n(src: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUPS_printer_sharing)\nDrive mounting\nTo prevent a user from mounting and unmounting drives, remove him from the plugdev group:\nuserdel <username> plugdev\n\nIf the user is currently logged in, this may not apply immediately; a relog may be required.\n\nA: Not so much an answer to your specific questions, but general advice.  \nSet up passwordless SSH login from the root account on a central \"management\" server out to all the workstations.\nIf your user population needs to share and protect files or otherwise identify themselves, set up all user accounts in NIS or LDAP and mount /home via NFS from a central sever.  Otherwise, have a \"guest\"-ish account (without \"sudo\"!) as the default auto-login on all workstations.\nMount \"/var/cache/apt/archives\" read-write and \"no_root_squash\" via NFS from a central server, and use scripting to do rolling updates around the whole lab ... that way you'll typically only download a package once.  For example,\nfor machine in `cat /usr/local/all_lab_machines.txt`\ndo\n    ssh $machine apt-get update\n    ssh $machine apt-get install  foo\ndone\n\nMake configuration tweaks (such as CUPS setup, for printing) in one place, and use rdist or a loop around rsync to push them out.\nTry clusterssh.\n\nA: How about puppet ?\n\nPuppet is a cross platform framework enabling system administrators to perform common tasks using code.\n\nI don't know much about it but it seems to pretty fit your requirement.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/puppet.html\nThere are other alternatives like Landscape, spacewalk, foreman: Are there any open source alternative to Landscape?\n", "Q: mksquashfs not excluding file I am having issues excluding a specific file from a squashfs.

This script should be auto startet by a cronjob every hour.\nMy check-script (selfcheck.sh):\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /home/teamspeak/s01\nLOGFILE='/home/teamspeak/s01/mylog.selfcheck'\n\nfunction logg(){\n        echo -n `date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` >>$LOGFILE\n        echo \" | `basename $0` $1\" >>$LOGFILE\n}\n\n\n#COMMANDLINE_PARAMETERS=\"${1}\" #add any command line parameters you want to pass here\nDIR=/home/teamspeak/s01/\nUSER=teamspeak\n\nlogg \"### GESTARTET ###\"\n\nif [ -e ts3server.pid ]; then\n    if ( kill -0 $(cat ts3server.pid) 2> /dev/null ); then\n        echo \"\"\n        echo \"      ###################\"\n        echo \"      #Server is running#\"\n        echo \"      ###################\"\n        echo \"\"\n        status=1\n\n        echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | Server is running\" >>$LOGFILE\n\n    else\n        echo \"\"\n        echo \"      ###########################\"\n        echo \"      #Server seems to have died#\"\n        echo \"      ###########################\"\n        echo \"\"\n        status=2\n\n        echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | Server seems to have died\" >>$LOGFILE\n\n    fi\nelse\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"      ##########################\"\n    echo \"      #The server isn't running#\"\n    echo \"      ##########################\"\n    echo \"\"\n    status=3\n\n    echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | The server isn't running\" >>$LOGFILE\n\nfi\n\nif [ $status = \"2\" ]; then\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"      ##############\"\n    echo \"      #Status ist \"$status\"#\"\n    echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | Status ist \"$status >>LOGFILE\n    echo \"      ###RE-START###\"\n    echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | RE-START\" >>LOGFILE\n    echo \"      ##############\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"      ######################\"\n    echo \"      #Stopping the Server!#\"\n    echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | Stopping the Server!\" >>LOGFILE\n    echo \"      ######################\"\n    echo \"\"\n    ./ts3server_startscript.sh stop inifile=ts3server.ini\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"      ######################\"\n    echo \"      #Starting the Server!#\"\n    echo \"`date +\\%d.\\%m.\\%Y` `date +\\%H:\\%M:\\%S` | Starting the Server!\" >>LOGFILE\n    echo \"      ######################\"\n    echo \"\"\n    ./ts3server_startscript.sh start inifile=ts3server.ini\n\n\nfi\n\nlogg \"###  BEENDET  ###\"\n\nexit 0\n\nNow my crontab entry:\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n  */1 *   *   *   *    /home/teamspeak/s01/selfchek.sh >> /home/teamspeak/s01/cronlog\n\nThis crontab is loading but there is no output in the \"cronlog\" file.

Set cron * */1 * * * to run on hour. \nRestart cron, after editing \nsudo service cron restart\n\nTo check how cron work run\ncrontab -l | grep -v '^#' | cut -f 6- -d ' ' | while read CMD; do eval $CMD; done\n\nLike you known log can check on \nless /var/log/syslog | grep cron\n\nEdit 1\nBased on your comment cron work. Also you say, when you run script you have output in defined log file LOGFILE='/home/teamspeak/s01/mylog.selfcheck' in script. Ok.\nYou wont to the same content from mylog.selfcheck in cronlog.\nThen set cron, as you already, to run script selfchek.sh and add\nsecond command in cron to put content from mylog.selfcheck to cronlog\n * */1 * * * cat /home/teamspeak/s01/mylog.selfcheck >> /home/teamspeak/s01/cronlog\n\nFinal cron code\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n  * */1 * * *    /home/teamspeak/s01/selfchek.sh\n  * */1 * * *    cat /home/teamspeak/s01/mylog.selfcheck >> /home/teamspeak/s01/cronlog\n\n", "Q: Installation Problem on Widows 8.1 I have Windows 8.1. I created a bootable USB, and when I clisk 'Install Ubuntu', all I get is a black screen with a white square. The PC hangs there, and I cannot do or see anything. \nHow do I proceed with the installation?\n\nA: I have seen this sort of thing with several attempts of different Linux distros, but with CD/DVD installs. LiveCD would show up fine, but the moment\nof install attempt, just seemed to go to blank screen and hang. \n  Take a look into 'boot options'. ACPI can be a problem and if the install\ncan't configure graphics beyond an initial requirement for LiveCD, just blank screen and hang. You will have to experiment to determine the best combination\nfor your situation.\n  Unfortunately, it may be more challenging if you discover the need for a graphics driver for your card. \n  This is not a solid or complete answer to your question, but it may send you\nin a direction getting you further along. Hope it helps.\n", "Q: Where does Telegram save sent pictures? When someone sends me a picture, where does Telegram save it on the storage? Is there a special folder? Or do I have to save every single picture manually and even if I press \"save\" to gallaery, where does it save it on the storage then?\nThank you!\n\nA: They are saved in /home/phablet/.cache/com.ubuntu.telegram/\"your-phone-number\"/photos\nthis is a hidden folder, so you will have to activate show hidden files in the file manager. \nIf you save to gallery they are saved under /home/phablet/pictures\n", "Q: HD recording via logitech c930e webcam I want to record an Hd video stream via this webcam (hopefully using a script)\nto capture simultaneously with a screen recording into one container. (you can see the pipeline code I've used before, below)\nas far as I know v4l2 doesn't support 1080 recording for this type of camera in fps more than 5 and I really need a hd stream with at least 20 fps. is there any other way or application for this purpose? \nbelow is the pipeline code of gstreamer and it's based on v4l2 and it can capture only 720P in 10 fps which is not enough at all! I do believe that ffmpeg has the same result since it's using v4l2 too. (please note that it's possible to capture 1080 with 5 fps (the command below) but I guess you can imagine how the quality would be(!) therefore I need fps more than 20)\nI really appreciate if you

From the v4l2 list-formats output you can see that it supports 30fps in FullHD with MJPEG.\nSo instead of using video/x-raw-yuv for your caps you should use image/jpeg. Mind you that if you need the final result to be H264 use a decoder before reencoding (jpegdec).\nWith that said, you are using gstreamer 0.10 that is now 3 years obsolete and unmantained. It is strongly recommended to move to 1.x version that is the current upstream version and has, among others, improved support for non-raw cameras.\n", "Q: Lost HDMI sound somehow A few days ago, everything with my HDMI was working fine - sound and video. Yesterday, PulseAudio Volume Control no longer detects HDMI output as an audio output - video still works fine.

The sound starts at the lightdm login screen. There is no hiss in Windows so this seems a specific problem to Ubuntu. Anyone have any ideas how to stop this?\nFrom reading around I've read a few suggestions to lower mic boost in alsamixer but i've tried this and its made no difference.\n\nA: I think I may have found a solution so I'm answering my own question! It might help someone else if they're struggling anyway.\nSo heres what I did. I ran lsmod in a Terminal and saw that there were 3 different codecs in use:\n\n\n*\n\n*snd_hda_codec_generic\n\n*snd_hda_codec_hdmi\n\n*snd_hda_codec_realtek\nI have no idea if this is normal but I thought maybe they have something to do with it so I blacklisted them all in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (by adding blacklist snd_hda_codec_xxxx at the end of the file). I also blacklisted snd_hda_intel just in case that was the culprit.\nI then rebooted and the hissing sound was gone but so was all sound (guessing this is because of blacklisting snd_hda_intel). \nSo next step was to start unblacklisting the various things 1 by 1. First I unblacklisted snd_hda_intel and the hissing was still gone but the sound was back to normal! \nInterestingly, even with the other 3 codecs blacklisted snd_hda_codec_generic and snd_hda_codec_hdmi still show up in lsmod. Is this because they're codecs and modules? \nAnyway there is no snd_hda_codec_realtek showing so im guessing this might have been the cause of the hissing. So far I have not faced any other sound related problems so I'm not sure why snd_hda_codec_realtek was loaded but its all working so I'll leave it this way unless someone offers a better solution\n\nA: Try alsamixer from command line.\nPress F4 (capture)\nUse left or right arrow key to highlight \"Mic Boost\".\nUse up/down arrow keys to adjust sound so that hiss is inaudible.\n", "Q: How to undo login password removal I need help, I am very new to Ubuntu and am running 14.04 LTS. the problem was that my password login screen would prompt me twice for my password, I could not find a solution so I decided to remove my password login completely.

I am having tremendous difficulty burning .iso images on 14.04 Trusty Tahr. I have used Brasero, K3B, and/or XFburn. I have tried just about everything gui possible, as well as command-line (e.g geniso and followed by growisof, even with downloaded and checksum checked .isos). \nEach time I've tried with all the Gui burners, they appear to burn even after setting the speed to the lowest possible options. But yet, after the disk ejects, and I put the disk back in, the supposed content isn't there and it appears in the nautilus file browser as Blank Dvd+R.\nSame thing occurs with growisof. The list of burn times, speeds and buffer percentages runs all the way to completion in the terminal, but yet the disc is still blank. \nI'am wondering if its a codecs issue or a change of codecs that has changed the ability to burn .isos since 12.04 on this machine. But there could be something ridiculously easy that I am not seeing. The permissions of the folder /media/$USER are 0750 (this is the folder in which the device mounts the blank dvd e.g /media/$USER/cdrom0/blankDVD+R). That is also different since 12.04 and previous editions. Formerly the list media mount point of any device (e.g USB or cdrom) was /media/device.\nIt should be known that the optical drive model is a TSSTcorp DVD+-RW SN-208BB on a Dell Inspiron-3520.\nPlease I welcome all answers intermediate to advanced!\nJorge Castro do you have any advice? I have read quite few of your post over the past few years about media manipulation.\nThanks \n\nA: codecs are not involved with ISO burning. Permissions\nwould already interfere at the beginning of the burn run.\nSo it's most probably your drive which fails to burn\nthe given media in a recognizable way.\nYou could try a different media type and/or brand\nor a different burner drive.\nHave a nice day :)\nThomas\n", "Q: Missing Wine Program Folder in Xubuntu 14.04-LTS After installing Wine 1.6.2 from the Ubuntu Software Center the Program folder with the installed Windows programs is not shown in XFCE menu.

To do this, create a new file named something like ExampleLauncher.desktop (the name isn't too important, since window managers will likely read the name from inside the file and display that inside). Then, open that file in your favorite editor (double-clicking may not work in this case, so you'll need to drag the file in), and add the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=JOSM Imports\nGenericName=Java OpenStreetMap Editor\nComment=Editor for OpenStreetMap.org\nExec=JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djosm.home=/home/saikrishna/.josm-imports/\" josm\nIcon=josm.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Education;Geography;\n\nThis is what I have to run a custom instance of JOSM.

Unless what you are running is in your $PATH, I recommend you use an absolute path.\n\n*Icon=: This is an icon file name that will be displayed. If there's no specific icon, you can skip this.\n\n*Terminal=: Specify if a terminal window should open when this is activated. For GUI programs, this will typically be false.\n\n*Type=Application: This is the type of .desktop file.

One, a strange code appears everytime I run the terminal(I've attached a picture of it). Two, I cannot run openfoam, an error occurs, a picture of which is also attached. Please help, I am new to ubuntu.  \n\nA: Neither of these suggestions may work for you, but here's what I would try first:\nRegarding the first issue, there's a hidden file in your home folder called .bashrc. Open a terminal and type ls -a which means \"list files -all of them\" and you should see the file. The contents of this file are executed every time you open your terminal, and I suspect that the offending line may have inadvertently been appended to it.\nAgain from the command line, type gedit .bashrc to open the file in a text editor, then search (ctrl-f) for the word ELMER4.0. If it shows up, comment out the line it occurs on by preceeding it with a #. Save the file (ctrl-s), then close the terminal and re-open it again. The error should be gone.\nFor the second error, the first thing I would do is to type sudo apt-get -f install into the command line. This will list any unmet depedencies any currently installed packages may have. If anything is missing, you can attempt to install it directly with sudo apt-get install [package-name].\n", "Q: Installing Oracle Java SE SDK 8u31 via apt-get How can I install the Oracle Java SE SDK 8u31 via apt-get on Ubuntu 12.04 (prevcise)?\nI tried:\napt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nfrom ppa:webupd8team/java, but it installed 8u45.\nAfter reading this, I tried to run:\napt-get install oracle-java8-installer=8u31+8u33arm-1~webupd8~1\n\nbut got this error:\nE: Version '8u31+8u33arm-1~webupd8~0' for 'oracle-java8-installer' was not found\n\nHow can I downgrade the install from 8u45 to 8u31?

Furthermore, it seems that there is no difference about which signal I send with fuser: it will react always the same way.  \nHowever, if I launch  \n\n./logtest &\n  ./logrotate.sh log  \n\nit happens that the C program logtest receives the signal from the command fuser and then terminates.  \nMy question is: why the two logging programs have different reactions to the signal sent from fuser? I mean, why the schell script keeps on working, whilst the C program terminates?  \nIn the man page of fuser in the RESTRICTIONS section it says  \n\nThe -k option only works on processes.  \n\nCould it be that shell scripts are not considered as real processes in the shell? This would be new for me... I have searched on Internet but no page found about fuser go deeply inside the signalling section.  \n\nA: Your script logtest.sh does only write into log and closes the file-descriptor immediately. So when you call fuser on log.1 there is no process which has an active file-descriptor for this file.\nYou can simulate this by running the while loop inside a list\n(while true; do echo $(date); sleep 1; done) >> log\n\nAnd both logtest.sh and logtest.c will terminate no matter which SIGNAL you send because you doesn't handle the signal. With bash this can be done with trap '<COMMAND>' USR1 (take a look at man bash-builtins). But I've no idea how this is done in C (never lerned C).\n\nA: The problem is that fuser only works on processes currently using a file which have an opened file descriptor for them in the kernel.\nWhile this is true for your C program, this is not true for your bash script:\necho $(date) >> log\n\nJust opens the file, appends stdout to it and immediately closes it. So the file is never deemed as opened by the kernel upon fuser's check.\nA simple solution would be to change your bash script so that the file it's kept open until the while loop ends:\n#! /bin/bash  \n\nwhile true \ndo\n    echo $(date) >> log\n    sleep 1\ndone < log\n\nThis way a file descriptor for log is created upon the while loop's start and it's kept open until the while loop's end.\n", "Q: ubuntu not working I have a macbook pro (15 inch, mid 2009) with OSX Yosemite 10.10.3.

Couldn't be easier.\nBut I'm having trouble making it work mpd.  I got past the user-space/system-wide pulseaudio/mpd issue by running mpd in user-space.  I can get it to send audio to one device using padevchooser (as Massimo suggested below).  But when I try to make an output for each ROCKI using the same sink names that work for VLC:\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"rockigreen\"\n}\n\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"rockigarage\"\n}\n\n...no sound comes out of my ROCKIs.\n\nA: The solution is the \"sink\" field in the audio_output section of.mpdconf.  I mistakenly thought mpd used the \"name\" field to select which pulseaudio sink to use, so I set \"name\" to the pulseaudio name (i.e. \"rockigreen\").  In actuality, mpd's \"name\" field is just the label used for the output.  However if you put the pulseaudio \"name\" in the .mpdconf \"sink\" field, mpd sends audio to the sink of that name.\n(You could also use the pulse audio sink index (0 or 1 or 2, etc..), but the sink index can change with reboots and device disconnects/reconnects, so the pulse audio \"name\" is a better choice.)\nThe following section of my .mpdconfig file allows me to select, via any mpd client software, any or all of the 3 pulse sinks, by whatever label I choose:\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"My A/V Receiver (via pulse)\"\n    sink        \"alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-surround-extra2\"\n}\n\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"The Rocki In My Bedroom\"\n    sink        \"rockigreen\"\n}\n\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"The Rocki In My Garage\"\n    sink        \"rockigarage\"\n}\n\nI'm running pulse, pulseaudio-dlna, and mpd as the current user (me).  As Massimo notes in his comment, this may not work or may require fancy user/group permission changes if you're not doing the same.\n\nA: I tested the following again and it works on another computer without any issues. Perhaps you did not restart mpd after you inserted the TCP module into pulseaudio. Or perhaps you did not enable the 2nd output.\nChange your 2nd output in your mpd.conf to:\naudio_output {\n    type            \"pulse\"\n    name            \"MPD Pulse Output\"\n    server          \"localhost\"\n}\n\nInsert the TCP module to pulseaudio:\npactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1\n\nRestart mpd:\nsudo service mpd restart\n\nInstall mpc to check the outputs:\nsudo apt-get install mpc\nmpc outputs\n\nMake sure the correct output is enabled:\nmpc enable <number-of-your-output>\n\nPlay a song, pulseaudio should now be aware of the mpd stream, so you can switch it via pavucontrol or the ubuntu sound settings to play on your device.\n", "Q: TRENDnet TEW-648UBM 802.11n 150Mbps Micro Wireless N Adapter not working Okay, so I purchased a usb wireless adapter for about 25 bucks in the hopes that it might work better than my on-board Broadcom one.

Or is it even relatively possible?\n\nA: I recommend the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a working backup from which you can easily read if you have enough storage space (e.g. a disk image which you can mount instead of a compressed archive which you have to read completely in order to extract one file)\n\n*Figure out where applications on CentOS store data which you can reuse on Ubuntu (if you use the same desktop environment a lot of settings will be preserved in your $HOME folder, but in order to make sure you have to research this information for each application that you want the settings to be preserved). Move data to a shared partition and create links and mount points (some applications might not like links because they fail to resolve the link and complain about permission issues, therefore test whether the applications work on CentOS right after moving the data)\n\n*Install Ubuntu and include the data from the shared partition like you did on CentOS. You might figure out that you missed some files, so move them to the data partition from the backup\n\n\nThis setup allows you to share data between multiple OS as long as applications don't get confused with different versions (e.g. using firefox 36.x on CentOS and 38.x on Ubuntu will cause the settings to be updated at every start and might mess up files at some point - this is a per application research task as well). In case of incomptibility of versions you need to figure out a custom synchronization routine which is out of scope of the OS, i.e. Ubuntu.\nRemember to use a command which preserves permissions, e.g. cp -a or rsync -a when you move files.\n", "Q: Tamil phonetic typing in Edubuntu 14.04 I'm trying to set up Tamil phonetic in Edubuntu 14.04.

The Amazon Fire phone does not offer an unlockable bootloader and at this time, the development community hasn't found a bootloader unlock exploit.\nSo in short, there is not, at this time any way to flash Ubuntu OS to your device.

Also, I want to remove from my system those Vivid Vervet packages which I had installed.\nThank you\n\nA: First you should remove the added repository. use ppa-purge Difference between \"ppa-purge\" and \"add-apt-repository -r\"?\n\nppa-purge - Disables a PPA and reverts to the official packages if\n  applicable. For example, if I added the xorg-edgers PPA and installed\n  the Nvidia drivers, if I do a ppa-purge on said PPA, it would not only\n  disable the xorg-edgers PPA but also revert the NVIDIA drivers from\n  the one in the PPA to the official ones found on the official Ubuntu\n  repositories.\n\nNow after purging the added repository then update software list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen do upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBut you have to notice that you may still need to downgrade some packages manually. To downgrade a package you can use the command:\n sudo apt-get install pkg_name=version\n\n", "Q: VLAN is not working in Virtual Box I had tried VLAN creating a VLAN pool in between the virtual boxes. But even after installing VLAN in client box, despite all the interface configurations, it is not pinging the other system in the same VLAN. \nI had created a bridged interface for pinging the outer world and another intnet internal network for interconnecting the virtual boxes, in both the machines.\nVirt boxes are pinging each other thorugh other interfaces, it is pinging outer world through the main interface eth0. Still not communicating via the VLAN interface. What is the reason behind it?  \n\nA: This is meant to be informative. It was hard to find out an answer for this question from other online resources.\nWhile using the provided adaptor types in virtual box, this issue arises.\nVLAN tag is stripped is because the Intel adapters support VLAN tagging and needs to be set in the adapter properties. When you don't provide such tag, the default is used (untagged). If you don't have the VLAN tab in the adapter properties, you haven't installed the advanced features of it.\nHence don't use the Intel PRO/1000 family of adaptors, because they will strip the VLAN tags. Instead, either use the Paravirtualized Network adaptor old default of AMD PCNet FAST III, neither of which seem to have this restriction.\nWhen I provided para-virtualised adapter settings, this started to work.\n", "Q: Polyglot installation in ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install the tool Polyglot.

I am currently using Macbook iterm2 for ssh connection to my ubuntu server.\n I am image processing via terminal and want to open the result. What whould be easist way of doing this?\n\nA: I don't know anything about mac, but in your ubuntu server you can enable forward X session. Afterwards you can run a graphical application on your server and relay the application window directly to your ssh client. I can describe the procedure for ubuntu serer AND client.\nServer:\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n*find line X11Forwarding and set it to yes*\n\nNOTE server must have X11 installed for this to work (ubuntu server doesn't come with X11 on by default as I recall but you can install it yourself. Mind that it's a major change to your server that can severely load up your server if it's a low cost machine not suited for graphical interface)\nClient:\nrun your ssh command with -x paramter. Afterwards you can request any graphics viewing software installed to open your picture.\nuser@remotehost# programofchoice /path/to/picture\n\nMy suggestion\nA simpler way is probably to simply copy the file to local disk using scp (a secure copy that uses ssh to copy the file to the local disk - you make a simple script to download the file without typing the path every time.\n", "Q: Windows has not been removed from dual boot I have removed windows 8.1 from dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 following this tutorial . I used the OS uninstaller as described in that tutorial. But still when i boot PC, I see that windows has not been removed, it still works well, although OS uninstaller confirmed that windows has been removed.\nWhat should I do to fully remove windows?\n\nA: You can try this tutorial found at lifehacker at Lifehacker.\n\n1)    Insert a live CD or USB for your Linux distribution and start up\n  its partition manager (like Gparted). Find your Windows partition in\n  Gparted's menu—it'll be listed as an NTFS drive.\n2)    Right-click on that Windows partition and choose \"Delete\" from\n  the menu. Your machine may have other Windows-related partitions as\n  well, like \"System Reserved\" and recovery partitions. If you want, you\n  can delete these as well (but make sure you have recovery discs handy\n  if you're going to delete a recovery partition).\n3)    Right-click on your Linux partition and choose \"Resize/Move.\"\n  Resize it so it takes up the rest of the now-free space on your drive.\n4)    Click the \"Apply All Operations\" button in the toolbar to\n  perform the selected tasks. It may give you a warning saying that your\n  computer may not boot, but with most Linux instalations this shouldn't\n  be a problem (though if it is, check out this article to fix it). This\n  process may take some time, so let it be!\nWhen it finishes, you should have a hard drive with nothing but Linux\n  on it. Your boot menu will still have some Windows entries, and it'll\n  work fine if you leave them there, but if you want to clean things up,\n  just open up a Terminal in Linux and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nto remove them.\n\n", "Q: Installing Lubuntu 15.04 on SSD forces formatting? I'm trying to install Lubuntu on a laptop with one SSD and one HDD, both had Linux mint 17  prior to current install.\nI've secure erased the SSD and would like to partition it my way rather than have the installer do it's thing; problem is - whenever I create a new partition (for both the SSD and the HDD) and uncheck the \"Format?\" option, it reverts to checked and greys out so that only upon removing the partition and creating it again, it is possible to uncheck it. (Which, does not solve the problem as once I hit apply for the new partition the format box reverts to being checked and greyed out again)\nI'm not sure if it's a bug or something I shouldn't take notice of, as it's been a while since my last install. But I am concerned as it does suggest that the Lububtu installer will format my SSD drive.\nIs anyone familiar with this issue? \nHow should I proceed with the install?\n\nA: This behaviour makes sense to me. In order for a new filesystem to be usable, certain things have to be written so that it can, for example, store the locations of files. This is what gets done during a format.\nSo why give you a checkbox at all? I'd say that's only really applicable for old, pre-existing filesystems that are already structurally complete. It's a UX bug that you can un-check it the first time.\nSo basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're asking the installer to repartition, new partitions are going to need to be formatted.\n\n*If you want to preserve data in a partition but also create new partitions alongside it, you'll need to do that manually outside the installer, preferably with something like GParted. You can then either use GParted to create your installation partitions (to which you select in the installer) or leave the space blank and use the installer's partitioner to install into the free space.\n\n*If you're in any doubt, take a backup before doing anything else.\n\n\nThat this is a SSD doesn't really matter:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSDs die slowly, sector-by-sector. All but the first and worst SSDs have wear-levelling handled in their firmware at hardware level. This shunts data to a new sector if another dies. \n\n*All but the first and worst can handle tens of thousands of writes per sector. I'm talking about filling and refilling the entire disk over and over and over and...\n\n*A format isn't writing to every sector. It's only writing to create the file tables. It isn't zeroing out all the data.\n\n\nPeople who are churning terrabytes of data on a daily basis might need to care more about their SSD health but a format is just creating an inode table. You've probably written more data to your SSD just posting the question than a format would be.\nI think part of the confusion comes from the word \"format\". The old Windows installers' \"format\" option was a full, \"low-level\" format that zeroed out all the data on the disk before creating a filesystem. Ubuntu's is the equivalent of a \"Quick Format\".\n", "Q: Where is my Disk Space?

Let's consider a simpler example:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.0\n\nMainView {\n    OptionSelector {\n        model: ListModel {\n            ListElement { name: \"Item 1\" }\n            ListElement { name: \"Item 2\" }\n        }\n        delegate: OptionSelectorDelegate {\n            text: i18n.tr(name)\n        }\n        onSelectedIndexChanged: {\n            console.log(name)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen the index is changed, we get the error, \"ReferenceError: name is not defined\".  And why would we expect it to be defined?  We've defined no variable named \"name\", and the OptionSelector doesn't have a \"name\" property.\nWhy can we reference \"name\" in the delegate?  A new object is created from the delegate for each element in the model.  This object gets the properties from that list element, and our list elements contain a \"name\" property.  Similarly, in your example, the U1db.Query produced list elements with a \"contents\" property, which evidently was an object with a \"name\" property.\nIf we want to reference those properties outside of the delegate, we need to reach into the model and extract them:\n            console.log(model.get(selectedIndex).name)\n\nIn your case, the model is a U1db.Query, not a ListModel, so it doesn't have a get() method.  It does have a results list that I presume you can index, but I don't know enough about U1db to say more.  Hopefully this is enough to get you on the right path.\n", "Q: opening port 80 on AWS I created a AWS EC2 VPS(ubuntu v14) on which I want to open port 80 so that my website can run.\nBut unfortunately, I am not able to open port 80.\nFor this, I first ran the command:\n$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\nwith this is what i get when I run\n $sudo iptables -L\n\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http\n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nI see, tcp dpt:http is ACCEPTED.\nBut when I run nmap to check port 80  it say port 80 is closed.

With that rule, you are basically telling iptables to accept any incoming TCP connections to destination port 80 (http) on your VPS. Technically, this rule isn't necessary since your INPUT chain policy is set to ACCEPT, which accepts any packet that traverses that chain.\nYour Nmap scan reveals that the port is closed. The reason for this is your VPS is responding to the Nmap scan with some sort of \"port not available\" error, resulting in the closed port status. If iptables were dropping the packets, you would see filtered as the port status.\nTry running netstat -anp | grep :80 on your VPS.

A release (eg 12.04, 14.04) will use and maintain a particular version of its software for the life of that release, adding updates like security patches but rarely* changing the major version. \nIt's between Ubuntu's releases, you'll see the major upgrades of software.

If it is set (has been declared) but nothing assigned to it (e.g. it is NULL) nothing will be inserted. \nThere may be a bug here though as the colon following the variable construct (...}:$PATH...) will still be inserted if $GZIP_BINDIR is set but NULL. Since this would add a colon at the beginning of the $PATH, it will cause the current directory to be searched first.\nThat is considered by most to be a security problem since it makes it easier to cause a malicious program with the same name as standard commands to be run just by putting it in the current directory.\nTo leave $PATH unchanged if $GZIP_BINDIR is set but NULL (empty), the correct syntax would be ${GZIP_BINDIR-'/bin:'}$PATH; export PATH\nTo leave $PATH unchanged if $GZIP_BINDIR is either unset or is set but NULL, the correct syntax would be ${GZIP_BINDIR:-'/bin:'}$PATH; export PATH\n\nA: This command update the PATH variable.\nThe PATH is an environment variable specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located.\nPATH=\"${GZIP_BINDIR-'/bin'}:$PATH\";\n\nThis add the value of another variable GZIP_BINDIR if exit to the previous PATH else use /bin instead and add it to PATH\nexport PATH\n\nexport is used to set the PATH available for all child processes and subshells\nRead this for more information about\nYou must note that this is not static and you'll loose it once you exit your shell.\nIn order to make this PATH edit permanent you have to append these lines to your .bashrc\ngedit .bashrc\n\nand add the line\nexport PATH=\"${GZIP_BINDIR-'/bin'}:$PATH\"\n\nthen run the command\nsource .bashrc\n\n\nA: ${GZIP_BINDIR-'/bin'} is a bash parameter expansion pattern. From man bash:\n${parameter:-word}\n              Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, \nthe expansion of word is substituted.  Otherwise, the  value  of parameter\nis substituted.\n\nImmediately prior to this portion man page has (thanks to @jwodder for notifying):\nOmitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset.\n\nAs the manpage says, it will set the default value of the variable GZIP_BINDIR. If GZIP_BINDIR has a value previously set (other than null as you are not using :) then that value will be used, otherwise /bin will be used as the value of the variable GZIP_BINDIR.\nOn the other hand if you want to test for null values too, use this pattern (include :):\n${GZIP_BINDIR:-'/bin'}\n\nAfter that the $PATH will be expanded to the values it was holding before. So, if PATH previously had:\n/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\nNow your PATH will be (considering GZIP_BINDIR is not set):\n/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\nexport PATH will make this PATH available to all the child processes.\n", "Q: Hibernation does not work in Ubuntu 15.04 When I enter sudo pm-hibernate in a terminal, it only turns the screen off for a small moment and immediately turns it on and then terminal goes to another blank line.

But when I press Cancel, another window pops up with an error:\nError: administrator_copy_file (/tmp/.Some_File_Here, /var/www/Rest_Of_Path_Here) failed: Authorization failed\nAs I am quite new to Ubuntu I don't know how to get rid of that authorization pop up.\nI have all permissions to /var/www folder.\n\nA: You don't have permission to write to /var/www/Rest_Of_Path_Here. ST3 is trying to elevate its UID to write as the correct user (hence the sudo prompt). I didn't know it could do this but I've tested it and it works so there you go.\nThere are a few ways you can fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow your user to write the files directly. So many options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*chown the files so you own them. This may upset things running as other users that might also need to write, eg a webserver running as www-user. You may need to change what they run as too.\n\n*Add your user to the www-data group  and change the file mask to 774 so members of the group can write/execute.\n\n*Change the file mask so other users can write (eg 777)... But this is pretty risky if there's something malicious on the server already.\n\n*Use ACLs to allow your user to write without disturbing the standard permissions framework.\n\n\n*Change your workflow to write into a version control system (eg git) as your users, and then have a script running as the other user check it out. This carries other benefits.\n\n*Run ST3 as a user who can write there:\nsudo -u www-data subl /var/www/Rest_Of_Path_Here\n\nThis is quite a lot uglier than just fixing the files.\n\nA: I had the same issue and was able to solve it by providing user right to the particular folder which I had to edit in Sublime text 3. I used the following commands:\nsudo chmod 775 -R projectname/   \nsudo chown username -R projectname/\n\nI think it might be helpful to others in future.\n\nA: Add your user to administrator user group by one of the below based on the version of Ubuntu you're using. Try both:\nsudo usermod -a -G admin username\n\nOR\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo username\n\nIf you're already in the admin group try a chown on the folder.\n\nA: I have the same issue, trying to edit my apache server's file with sublime-text and I don't want to mess up my webserver's permission. Changing your files g+w and putting your user in www-data group is not a very safe idea.\nWhat I would advise is using SFTP plugin for sublime-text: \n\n\n*\n\n*duplicate your webserver's file to a folder belonging to your own user\n\n*configure SFTP plugin with:\n\n\n\n\"upload_on_save\": true,\n\"host\": \"localhost\",\n\"user\": \"www-data\",\n\n\nDo not provide a password in the configuration for this is a major security hole too.\nSublime-text will ask you for the password once and then will remember it for the session. Upon each file save, it will open an sftp session to localhost and will write the file to disk with the appropriate user\n\nA: Perform the following in your Linux/Unix terminal:\nsudo chmod -R 777 project-name\nsudo chown user-name project-name\n\nTried -R 775 and didnt work so -R 777 did the trick although I have given write permissions to all project\n\nA: Add your current user to www-data group. \n$USER already has the current user  or you can change it for another user.\nsudo usermod -a -G www-data $USER\n\nChange permissions.\ncd /var/www/Your_Project\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data .\nsudo find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \\;\nsudo find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\n\n\nA: a quick solution would be to add your user to the www-data group with root user (sudo command):\nusermod -a -G www-data your_username\n\nCheck if it is there:\ngrep ^www-data /etc/group\n\nAnd do not forget to restart your system\n", "Q: How ot install ubuntu on a USB stick and make 100% sure you won't mess your internal HDD install? I learned the hard way that when you install ubuntu to a usb stick it messes up your boot partition and the install of your internal hdd can't run anymore.\nWell, what is 100% fool proof way to simply install it to a usb stick (usb hdd whatever) and not mess your internal install?\nMost tutorials advise you to disconnect your HDD as a 100% fool proof way. Well I'm with laptop that makes that very hard.\nOther tutorials advise using Virtual Box and install guest addons to make it see the USB and install it then. Well that seems like an overkill and involves installing non-free software.\nSo, isn't there some simple solution? I mean that seems like easy enough task, right?\nRight?\n\nA: Instead of installing a complete Ubuntu system to your memory stick, you should install a live image with persistence enabled (i.e. files in the home folder are kept). You can do this by running:\ngksudo usb-creator-gtk\n\nThen, choose the Ubuntu ISO image, and choose the amount of space you want to be reserved for persistence.\nYou may need to install the program first for this to work. If you get an error or nothing opens, run the command:\nsudo apt-get install usb-creator-gtk\n\nWhen it's finished installing, run the original command again.\nIf you're doing this from Windows, you can use the Universal USB Installer to achieve the same result. Just chooose the ISO image and the USB stick, and choose the amount of persistence you want.\n\nA: I don't think it's a good idea to install an OS in any portable media, mostly because of performance issues, but also because of boot manager issues as you described.\nThat being said, I'd use unetbootin to create a live usb, which is probably what you want anyway. Just make sure to follow the (simple) instructions, and nothing bad will happen.\n", "Q: 8GB RAM installed, free only shows 4GB I've installed 8GB of RAM (2x4GB) in my computer.

Go in the bios and slow it down to accommodate the slowest memory.  You might have to test by going slower than the specification to get to a point where the full memory is working.\nAfter you have a working configuration, of course if it works as a results of slowing down the process speed, invest into changing the slowest sticks will faster sticks.\n", "Q: How to put Preinstalled UBUNTU Touch Image in usb I have an x86 tablet and I want to install Ubuntu touch on it\nI downladed the tar.gz image at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch/daily-preinstalled/20150523/\nbut since its tar.gz I do not know what should I do with it please help, I am not very knowledgeable\nFYI : I am on windows 8.1\nThanks for help!\n\nA: I'm not sure about installing the tar.gz file, but you can download an ISO image from here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-desktop-next/daily-live/current/. Note: these are unstable (as is the file you already downloaded) and could break easily.\nThe file you probably want is this. If your tablet isn't 64-bit, then download this one.

Is the one user wrong? When I look at permissions with namei -l, I often see things like root root or proxy proxy. \nWhy does the owner have to be defined and listed 2 times?\n\nA: It is not user:user, but user:group.\nThis is command format\nchown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...\nGroup of users may include many users. Here is some information regarding groups:\nLinux uses groups as a way to organize users. Groups organize collections of accounts, primarily as a security measure. Control of group membership is administered through the /etc/group file, which shows a list of groups and its members. Every user has a default or primary group. When a user logs in, the group membership is set for their primary group. This means that when a user launches a program or creates a file, both the file and the running program will be associated with the user’s current group membership. A user may access other files in other groups, as long as they are also a member of that group and the access permissions are set. To run programs or create a file in a different group, the user must run the newgrp command to switch their current group. \nA file is owned by a user and a group. By default it is owned by the user who created the file and his default group, unless it is changed.\nIn your case user root is a member of group root.\n\nA: man chown gives description and usage and other useful info on chown command.\nNAME\n       chown - change file owner and group\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...\n       chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...\n\nForm the info given by man page, we may know that chown $USER:$USER changes owner and group of target file to $USER, while chown $USER only changes owner of target file to $USER, leaving group of the target file unchanged.\nDetails (from man page) follow:\nOwner  is  unchanged  if  missing.   Group is unchanged if missing, but changed to\nlogin group if implied by a ':' following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and  GROUP  may\nbe numeric as well as symbolic.\n\nSo chown $USER:$USER can be shortened as chown $USER:.\nOutputs like root root from namei -l command mean that the owner and group of that file are both set to root. That's not owner defined or listed twice. Owner and group are two related but different concepts. And a file always has a owner and a group.\n\nAs to use chown command, great chances are superuser privilege is required, since one is likely to transfer the ownship of a file when using chown command. However, that is not always the truth.\nSay, we have a user named 'test', who belongs to several groups. id command gives following output:\nuid=1000(test) gid=1000(test) groups=1000(test),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lpadmin),110(sambashare)\n\nAnd user 'test' owns the following file:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 test test 0 May 27 23:34 test_file\n\nThen we can change the group of test_file to sambashare without superuser privilege, as user 'test' belongs to 'test' group and 'sambashare' group at the same time, user 'test' already owns enough permission to change the group of the file.\n\nA: The chown command is used to change the owner and group owner of a file or directory.\nSuperuser privileges are required to use this command. The syntax of chown looks like\nthis:\nchown [owner][:[group]] file...\n\nchown can change the file owner and/or the file group owner depending on the first argument of the command. Here are some examples:\nchown owner file example:\nchown bob file --> Changes the ownership of the file from its current owner to user bob.\n\nchown owner:group file example:\nchown bob:users file --> Changes the ownership of the file from its current owner to user bob and changes the file group owner to group users.\n\nchown :group file example:\n chown :admins file --> Changes the group owner to the group admins. The file owner is unchanged.\n\nchown owner: file example:\nchown bob: file --> Change the file owner from the current owner to user bob and changes the group owner to the login group of user bob.\n\nPlease read this nice tutorial https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups.

I would like to set Thunar as my default file manager in 15.04. Now, I realize that this question is very similar to How to set Thunar as a default file manager?, but I have tried Kevin's answer, why I even tried rebooting after I completed his suggestion but still Nautilus is used as my default File Manager. I even tried the shell script, Midnight Commander and Manual solutions recommended on the Community Help Wiki. Not one changed Thunar to my default file manager. \nI was curious as to whether exo could change my default file manager at all, say to dolphin (as I also saw this question and its answer) but that also failed. Something tells me that this issue affects not just me but other users too, specifically 15.04 users, as Ubuntuuser reported in the comments that he could not set dolphin as his default file manager via exo either. \nIf you would like to know how I am checking whether these file managers are set to default, well I open folders on my desktop by double-clicking them to see whether they're opened in these alternative file managers or not and as a second test I also try to save files in Chrome to see whether the file manager window that pops up is the one I want. \nIf relevant I am running Unity as my Desktop Environment. \n\nA: I'm sorry that this is a bit late but I hope it is still helpful to you and others. I've never found the 'exo' method to work either and it was annoying to install an application for just this purpose so I looked for the manual method.

The one thing that I don't know how to change is the file picker dialog. The setting is determined by GTK but there doesn't appear to be a way to configure it. I hope this helps. :)\n(If after a while you decide you want the Unity quicklist for Thunar too, open up another question and I'll answer that also)\n\n\nA: None of the other solutions worked for me.

Various options for mapping Caps Lock to Shift with locking are available:\n\n", "Q: Unable to start/stop apache on Ubuntu I am trying to start apache using the following command:\nsudo -E -u [my_username] /usr/sbin/apachectl -f conf/httpd.conf\n\nI get the following error:\nno listening sockets available, shutting down\nUnable to open logs\n\nThe only 2 changes I have made to httpd.conf are as below:\nListen [IP address]:8081\n<VirtualHost [IP address]:8081>\n    RewriteEngine on\n    RewriteRule ^(.*) http://[IP address]$1 [P]\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNote: I am trying to get apache configured on a remote server so I cannot use localhost \nCan anyone guide me as to where I maybe going wrong?\n\nA: It could be your firewall causing the problem.

Basic keyboard layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 → 1\n\n*Shift+1 → !\nI would like: Ctrl+1 → ¹. (Superscript one character). The following code allows me to type ¹, but only with Shift+1:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  10 = 1 onesuperior\"\n\nConclusively, I would like to keep Shift+1 for ! and Ctrl+1 for ¹.\n\nA: *\n\n*This seems to me very related to:\nHow do I assign a keyboard shortcut that uses AltGr as a modifier key?\nKeep Right Alt or AltGr as ISO_Level3_Shift and try to use it as Alt Modifier too.\nWhere in your case is reverse: Keep Right Ctrl or Left Ctrl as Control Modifier and an extend it to be used a Level Shift.\n\n*I couldn't get it to work in both functions, one trial was by adding actions: (Doesn't work)\nkey <RCTL> {\n         type= \"ONE_LEVEL\",\n         symbols[Group1]= [ ISO_Level5_Shift ],\n         actions[Group1]= [ SetMods(modifiers=Control) ]\n};\n\nfrom xkb - problems using virtual keys and ISO_Level3_Shift key but it just works one way only.\nPossibly, someone knowing XKB very well can make such setup.\n\n*One setup that works for me: (no key repeat)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and setup xbindkeys & xautomation as in How can I change what keys on my keyboard do?

Superscript and subscript exist in word editor (LibreOffice, Ms Word, etc) but, for example, in Latex we use underscore \"_\" for subscript and ^ for superscript.\n", "Q: Problem with CPUPower I have set my CPU frequency to min and max, but when my laptop is plugged to the adapter it changes it automatically the min and max frequency to the maximum  CPU frequency (2.2Ghz).

I have tried to set this with Remmina, but when I double-click an RDP file, it simply opens Remina, it doens't actually connect.\n\nA: Remmina does not support opening RDP files. Instead you can open RDP files directly with xfreerdp, the actual RDP client that Remmina uses under the hood for RDP.\nYou have two options, both described in https://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/ubuntu-fix-add-program-to-list-of-applications-in-open-with-when-right-clicking-files-in-nautilus/\nOption #1: create a mime-type file association:\nCreate file /usr/share/applications/xfreerdp.desktop with following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=FreeRDP\nExec=xfreerdp %f\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nMimeType=application/x-rdp\n\nNow when you right-click the rdp file and go to options there will be an option to open it with \"FreeRDP\". The 'Terminal=true' option will open xfreerdp in the terminal (as it's a console application), where xfreerdp will ask for user credentials.\nOption #2: use mimeopen:\nRun mimeopen against your RDP file with the '-d' flag:\n$ mimeopen -d <path to rdp file>\nPlease choose a default application for files of type text/plain\n\n1) gnome  (gnome-usercreated-1)\n2) LibreOffice Writer  (libreoffice-writer)\n3) gedit  (org.gnome.gedit)\n4) Vim  (vim)\n5) Other...\n\nuse application #\n\nType the number corresponding to 'Other...'. In this case it's 5. You'll be asked to type the command:\nuse application #5\nuse command:\n\nBecause xfreerdp is a console app, you can't just type xfreerdp here. Instead pass xfreerdp as an argument to your terminal app, in my case gnome-terminal:\nuse command: gnome-terminal -x xfreerdp\n\nThe xfreerdp will then launch in a terminal window and will open the RDP file.\n", "Q: GMail thinks the Ubuntu GMail app is Safari I installed the GMail app onto my Ubuntu 15.04 machine.\nUpon logging in, a warning message appears, saying This version of Safari is no longer supported.

(Chances of me using Ubuntu is almost zero but still asking as curiosity)\nI want partition the disk into 3 GPT partitions as following:\n1) 100GB Partition fro Ubuntu 14.04 64bit OS.\n2) 100GB Partition for Storing Books etc\nand \n3) 800GB Partition for Media Storage like Songs, Movies etc\n4) 16GB as Swap\nand \n5) may be 500MB to 1GB for EFI Partition if needed.\nSo how can I install Ubuntu 14.04 on this EFI System?\nIf I disable EFI and use Legacy mode, does it affect my performance?\nIf Yes how can install Ubuntu with EFI Enabled?\nI'm quite new to this EFI term, so please explain in detail.\nI tried installing with EFI ON before writing this question, but got ERROR Message saying \"Unable to mount vfat EFI partition\". (Installation windows said I need to create on partition at least of 35MB or more of type EFI, so I created of 1GB of ext4 and set it as a EFI partition but got above error message).\nPlease Help ASAP as I have no other OS my system and unable to use it.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu as a single system. It must not be hard. Use a 64-bit Ubuntu release. Boot from liveCD, start gparted and create partitions you need.\nIf you disable EFI, it won't affect performance, but the system may boot a little bit slower.\nEFI partition should be not less that 50 MB and formatted to fat32. In most cases there is no need to make it larger than 200-300 MB. I use 100 MB size and never had any problems.\nBut there are issues discussed in the net, that some EFI's deal incorrectly with partitions smaller than 512 MiB. So to be 100% safe you can create a 550MiB EFI partition.\nAlso 32 GB swap is an overkill for 8 GB RAM. I suggest making swap not more than 4 GB. In 99% it will not be needed at all. Hibernation is also not useful for this amount of RAM. System will boot as fast as thaw.\nWhen you install Ubuntu just set EFI partition as EFI boot, or /boot/efi, I do not remember the exact name in the installer. But you will easily find it from a drop down menu.\nEverything else should be as before, like installing without UEFI.\nYou get this error, because you formatted EFI partition to ext4, not to fat32.\nYou can install Windows 8 later, but you will need to re-install grub after that. Boot repair is a nice utility for that.\n", "Q: CTRL-ALT-L not locking screen Ubuntu 15.04 w/ Gnome Title says it all.\nThis is a feature I need.  It's probably something easy, but googling it just gave me a hodgepodge of unrelated stuff.\n\nA: You can set the Keyboard Shourtcut for locking the screen and other operation in the keyboard settings:\n\n\nA: I've the same problem and it's somehow related to the lightdm display manager. I use the following workaround. Right after logging in I open a terminal and run: \n/etc/init.d/lightdm restart\n\nThis will restart the display manager and also kills the current X session. After logging in again all keyboard shortcuts should work fine.  \n\nA: You could use the GSettings configuration tool.\nOpen a terminal and fire this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys screensaver \"<Ctrl><Alt>l\"\n\nThe default value is <Super>l\n\nA: This could be related to this bug, also available as this GNOME bug where many shortcut keys stop working. If you have GNOME 3.16 I would look into it. There is not a fix out yet, but it is marked as high importance, so a fix may be released soon.\n\nA: The default keyboard shortcut has been changed.  The new shortcut is Super + L.  \"Super\" means the Windows key, typically on the left side of the keyboard just below Z.\nIf you'd prefer to use the old Ctrl + Alt + L shortcut (or anything else) then you can do so by opening the Settings app and choosing Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> System -> Lock Screen, and re-assigning the action to a new shortcut.\n\nA: I am not sure if you are still having this issue, but the same thing was happening to me and I solved it by switching from lightdm to gdm. Install gdm if you don't already have it, and then sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm. Hope this works for you too!\n\nA: You can create a custom shortcut in the shortcut menu.  The command should be:\ngnome-screensaver-command -l\n\n\nA: You can try Pressing windows(button next to left ctrl) + L which also locks the computer. It works for me, hopefully help you as well.\n", "Q: Drive won't mount after passphrase I have enjoyed my time with linux and the learning process.  So much so, that i setup a profile for my son.

The ibus method handles both layouts correctly. \nI'll post a bug report and see what they think. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I can't see what exactly. \n\nA: So the xkb way is a bit confusing but this is how it works: the \"us,il\" following the -layout flag is a tuple and so in that case the -variant flag would expect a tuple as well. Therefore a command for both layouts could be:\nsetxkbmap -layout us,il -variant altgr-intl, -option grp:alt_shift_toggle\n\nNote the comma after altgr-intl.\n", "Q: Nautilus won't launch in Ubuntu 15.04.

To avoid problems with concurrent access, only one process can hold the lock on these files at once.  apt-get and dpkg will show these errors instead.\nIs Software Updater (or another Ubuntu package management tool) running in the GUI? If so, close it and try again.\nOr you can check for other running apt processes using ps.\nThese is a similar question here with several more answers on how to check for other processes and either kill them, or remove the lockfile. If you can't easily get the directories unlocked, check here: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?\n\nA: The Linux way of installing applications prevent running of more than one process using the packaging tools such as apt-get install/upgrade/dist-upgrade and dpkg -i at the same time.\nFor that when you are using one of these tools and try to use another tool at same time before the first process has completely closed then you'll have this problem.\nTo test it,easily try to run a command sudo apt-get upgrade and at the same time try to install some app lets say vim sudo apt-get install vim, you'll see the error.\n", "Q: When I Formatted an external hard drive in Ubuntu the drive disappeared from the list of devices I just installed Ubuntu and I connected an external hard drive.\nI then went into the Files Icon and selected the external drive so I could format it.\nWhen I began the format, the drive disappeared from my list of devices.\nIs this normal?

I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on a Lenovo G50-30. When I installed Ubuntu I got some troubles with the WiFi. I couldn't turn it on/off.\nI searched on Internet and found out some commands to fix it and it worked. But, every time Ubuntu starts I have to type this command to get WiFi up:\nsudo modprobe -r ideapad-laptop\n\nWhat can I do to fix this?\nAlso how do I run commands automatically every time the system boots?\n\nA: Make sure the wifi is on and working then run the following command to blacklist the module.\necho \"blacklist ideapad-laptop\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf    \n\nReboot.\n\nA: modprobe -r is used to remove a kernel module. You can blacklist the module so that you donot have to remove it after every boot. For this open a terminal and type:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \n\nBy the above command  we are asking nano, the Ubuntu GUI text editor to open /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. But normal users do not have permission to write to this file. So we use sudo to run the command with root privileges.\nAdd the name of the module you want to blacklist to the file opened using the following format:\nblacklist driver-name\n\nTo exit, press Ctrl + X followed by y (for Yes).\nSince you asked, when using Linux, you never have to type in the same commands everytime the system boots. You can automate it. If you want a particular command to be executed every time Ubuntu boots, just add this to /etc/rc.local. For this, open a Terminal and type, :\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nOnce gedit is opened, write the command you want to execute during bootup starting from the second last line, ie. before exit 0.

From Community Help > Repositories, Software in Ubuntu’s repository is divided into four categories or components: main, restricted, universe and multiverse. \n\n\n*\n\n*Main: The main component contains applications that are free software, can be freely redistributed and are fully supported by the Ubuntu team. \n\n*Universe: The universe component is a snapshot of the free, open-source, and Linux world. It houses almost every piece of open-source software, all built from a range of public sources.\n\n*Restricted: Proprietary drivers that make it possible to install Ubuntu and its free applications on everyday hardware\n\n*Multiverse: The multiverse component contains software that is not free, which means the licensing requirements of this software do not meet the Ubuntu main component licence policy.\n\n\n\n\nWe can understand why restricted components are provided. As the page says,\n\nOur commitment is to only promote free software – or software\n  available under a free licence. However, we make exceptions for a\n  small set of tools and drivers that make it possible to install Ubuntu\n  and its free applications on everyday hardware. These proprietary\n  drivers are kept in the restricted component. Please note that it may\n  not be possible to provide complete support for this software because\n  we are unable to fix the software ourselves - we can only forward\n  problem reports to the actual authors. Some software from restricted\n  will be installed on Ubuntu CDs but is clearly separated to ensure\n  that it is easy to remove. We will only use non-open-source software\n  when there is no other way to install Ubuntu. The Ubuntu team works\n  with vendors to accelerate the open-sourcing of their software to\n  ensure that as much software as possible is available under a free\n  licence.\n\nHowever, why is the multiverse category included? What is the purpose of it?\nThere is wide range of non-free/proprietary applications & software included in the multiverse category. I don’t understand why this is considered a good thing.\n\nA: Your needed answer is quoted from http://www.howtogeek.com/194247/whats-the-difference-between-main-restricted-universe-and-multiverse-on-ubuntu/\n\nMultiverse – Unsupported, Closed-Source and Patent-Encumbered Software\nMultiverse is the place for questionable, controversial stuff. This\n  includes closed-source software like the Adobe Flash plug-in and\n  packages that depend on closed-source software, like plug-ins for\n  Skype. It also includes open-source software with legal restrictions —\n  for example, audio and video playback software that infringes patents.\n  DVD playback software isn’t included here — there are serious legal\n  issues around the open-source libdvdcss DVD playback library. In fact,\n  libdvdcss appears to be illegal in the USA.\nUbuntu can’t officially distribute these packages along with the main\n  distribution, but they’re provided here for your convenience. On other\n  Linux distributions, the stuff here is often found in third-party\n  repositories you have to go out of your way to find — RPM Fusion for\n  Fedora, Packman for openSUSE, and Penguin Liberation Front (PLF) for\n  the defunct Mandriva distribution.\nAs with the Universe repository, Multiverse is a community-supported\n  repository. There’s no guarantee of security updates here. Because so\n  many of the packages are closed-source, the community often couldn’t\n  fix problems you encounter even if they wanted to.\nYou can spot these packages by their “Unknown” license. As with\n  Universe, the Ubuntu Software Center states the Ubuntu community may\n  provide updates, but Canonical won’t.\n\nIndeed I find to word to add to the above, great explanation and detailed what is needed\n\nA: The distinction between restricted and multiverse is that Ubuntu itself pledges to support the software in restricted, whereas software in multiverse is provided by Ubuntu but with no guarantee of Ubuntu support.  I's not really fair to say universe and multiverse software is \"unsupported\", just that support will be dependent on the third party that produced it, or other third parties, and/or the \"Ubuntu community\": volunteers that package software for Ubuntu.  This is opposed to software in main and restricted where Ubuntu have allocated dedicated people to ensure its support.\nThe distinction between restricted/multiverse and main/universe is that the software in restricted/multiverse is not fully free by Ubuntu's definition of free software, though it is still free enough for Ubuntu to distribute it in a repository.  Usually this means that it contains binary code for which the source is not available, though sometimes it can be other licensing issues.\nSo, technically, multiverse contains software that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu can distribute, but is not fully free - probably contains binary code without source.\n\n*Ubuntu itself doesn't guarantee to support.\n\n\nWhat are examples of packages in multiverse?\nChiefly, ubuntu-restricted-extras is a metapackage containing a suite of software Ubuntu thinks you really are likely to want, even though it's not open source software.\n\n\n*\n\n*Installer for Adobe's Flash plug-in\n\n*Microsoft Core Fonts for the Web\n\n*A selection of video or audio codecs with non-free licenses\n\n*Unrar\nOther packages in multiverse, but not part of ubuntu-restricted-extras, include a small range of Linux based software included either because Ubuntu thinks you're very likely to want to install it on Ubuntu, or because it is very much open source software in spirit but misses out on qualifying with Ubuntu's definition of free software for some reason, such as by including some binary code without source, or some license terms that make its license incompatible (eg a non-commercial clause, or any other \"custom\" clauses added to otherwise compatible open source licenses).\n", "Q: How to upgrade Openfire from 3.8.2 to 3.10.0?

I am wondering, if I always have to press \"sync\" in the calendar app or if there is a way to actually automatically sync my google calendar.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: To do automatically sync, you can use command lines in terminal app. I think automatically sync is not implemented yet in calendar app.\nThe method below should work with google calendar (I'm not sure because I use calendar from owncloud server)\nTo see the name of calendar server you have to sync, you can use this command : \nsyncevolution --print-configs\n\nThe name of the server could be google-calendar or google-calendar-2, ....\nThen you should be able to sync your calendar by this command :\nsyncevolution google-calendar\n\nor google-calendar-2, ... \nTo automatically run this sync command, a way is to use \"crontab job\"\nYou can see this post for some details about crontab in ubuntu touch.\nI try to describe below the method 1 using a terminal connected with ssh to the phone : \nEdit crontab file with this command : \ncrontab -e\n\nAdd this line at the end of the file : \n@daily export DISPLAY=:0.0 && export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(ps -u phablet e | grep -Eo 'dbus-daemon.*address=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-[A-Za-z0-9]{10}' | tail -c35) && /usr/bin/syncevolution google-calendar\n\nThen use Ctrl+X to quit and save the file (may have to enter \"Y\" et \"Enter\")\nAfter that to restart the cron service : \nsudo service cron restart\n\nThe \"google-calendar\" should automatically daily sync. you can replace @daily by @reboot, @midnight, @weekly, ...\nEdit 04/06/2015\nIf you do this in the phone terminal, the crontab file is not saving because of ubuntu touch is on \"read file only system\"\nOne solution that could work is to switch in read/write mode for the system file (at your own risk)\nYou can for example do  : \nsudo mount /dev/loop0 / -o remount,rw \n\ncrontab -e\n\nThen modify and save the file like you did.\nAfter that, you can check the file by using : \ncrontab -l\n\nIt's not recommended to switch in read / write mode for normal user.

I was using 14.04 before, and I was able to setup and make tftp server and client work. Now that I upgrade to 14.10, tftp server isn't working anymore\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the package.\nsudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa\n\n\n*Edit config file as follows.\nsudo vi /etc/default/tftpd-hpa\n# /etc/default/tftpd-hpa\nTFTP_USERNAME=\"tftp\"\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\"/tftpboot\"\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\"0.0.0.0:69\"\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\"-s -c -l\"\n\n\n*Create TFTP folder.\nsudo mkdir /tftpboot\nsudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot\nsudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot\n\n\n*Restart the app to apply new configuration.\nsudo service tftpd-hpa restart\n\n(Source)\nAt that time, I didn't know that tftpd-hpa is the package for TFTP server and tftp-hpa is for TFTP client so what I did was install another package for the TFTP CLIENT.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp\n\n\n*Change permission of /etc/xinetd.d directory.\nsudo chmod –R 777 xinetd.d\n\n\n*Create a file named tftp in /etc/xinetd.d and write the following:\nservice tftp {\nsocket_type = dgram\nprotocol = UDP.\nWAIT = YES\nuser = root\nserver = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd\nserver_args =-s /tftpboot\ndisable = no\nper_source = 11\ncps = 100 2\nflags = IPv4\n}\n\n\n*Save and exit.\n\n*Create tftpboot directory and change permission.\ncd /\nsudo mkdir /tftpboot\nchmod –R 777 /tftpboot\n\n\n*Restart the service\nsudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart\n\nThis step by step process of installing TFTP server and another package for TFTP Client workis in 14.04 but not in 14.10, and I think that the 2nd installation and set up (sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp) is the culprit why TFTP server isn't working. I've already uninstalled the packages which I think isn't needed. But TFTP server still isn't working. What can I do to make TFTP server work?\n\nA: This works for me:\nservice tftp\n{\nprotocol        = udp\nport            = 69\nsocket_type     = dgram\nwait            = yes\nuser            = nobody\nserver          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd\nserver_args     = /tftpboot\ndisable         = no\n}\n\n\nA: This is an old question, but for anyone looking for clarity my answer may help:\ntftpd-hpa is a self-contained tftp server - it doesn't need xinetd configured to work, in fact some of the recommendations I've read will result in contention for port 69 between tftpd-hpa and xinetd!\nThe answer  elsewhere on this page from user storm is an example. I'm sure this xinetd configuration works with some other tftp package, but I don't see how it could with tftpd-hpa.\nTake a look at the default configuration for tftpd-hpa in /etc/default/tftpd-hpa:\n# /etc/default/tftpd-hpa\n\nTFTP_USERNAME=\"tftp\"\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\"/srv/tftp\"\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\":69\"\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\"--secure\"\n\nUnless you need a solution with more options, you should make sure you do not configure xinetd to handle tftp or listen on port 69 (or just don't install it at all). Edit /etc/default/tftpd-hpa as per your needs and then run sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa and you should be good. You can verify with this:\n$ sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 69\nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:69              0.0.0.0:*                           45262/in.tftpd\nudp6       0      0 :::69                   :::*                                45262/in.tftpd\n\n", "Q: Steam: OpenGL GLX context is not using direct rendering, which may cause performance problems I have the fgxrl driver(gfx: Radeon HD7950, 3GB), yet steam provides me this error every time on startup after I installed it.\nWhat is the fix?

Look in /usr/share/xsessions for a .desktop file named after Pantheon, and check the Exec line in that file:\n$ grep Exec -R /usr/share/xsessions/pantheon.desktop\nExec=gnome-session --session=pantheon\n\nFor a one-time run, you can do:\nstartx /usr/bin/gnome-session --session=pantheon\n\nFor a long-term setting, use .xinitrc. Usually, you wouldn't have an .xinitrc present. So, create one containing:\n#! /bin/sh\nexec /usr/bin/gnome-session --session=pantheon\n\nThen run startx.\nCheck the Arch Wiki article on .xinitrc to see how to make more a full-fledged one.\n\nA: Sounds like you're missing a desktop manager to start X.

In a previous install of ubuntu, my lvm encryption pw was no longer recognized and I lost it all! This occurred on a dual boot setup on a macbook pro 2010, from when I did a drive repair from within mac OS X and subsequently reset the pram. I gave on ubuntu dual boot for a while.\nRecently however, I decided to try once again and installed ubuntu 15.04 on a partition of the macbook pro 2010 with the following configuration: lvm partition encryption mount point at /, 1gig unencrypted mount point /boot.\nIt loads fine now although I am working on configuring an encrypted swap partition (I posted it posted here: Add a swap partition post-install 15.04). The only noticible glitch appears to be a distorted screen on load-up where it should ask for the lvm encryption pass however it displays as scrambled white mesh. I can however input my lvm encryption pass here which forwards me to login to ubuntu as per normal.\nMy main concern is that if I run a drive repair from within my osx parition or if my ram is reset, I will lose the lvm encryption key and no longer be able to access my ubuntu partition as happened earlier on a previous install!\nAny suggestions or ideas from the community here?\n\nA: AFAIK, a PRAM/NVRAM reset should not affect the encryption key. You said you did a \"drive repair from within mac OS X,\" and that action might cause problems, but that goes beyond disk encryption -- if you force a utility that doesn't understand LVM or Linux filesystems to \"repair\" a Linux filesystem or Linux LVM partition, the result is likely to be data corruption, whether or not encryption is used. Encryption will make data recovery from such an event much harder to do, though.\nOrdinarily, I'd expect OS X's utilities to not try to \"repair\" a Linux filesystem or LVM partition they don't understand. They might do so if your partition type code is wrong, though. Linux partitions should be of type 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4 (no flag set in recent versions of GParted or parted, type code 8300 in gdisk). There's the related question of hybrid MBRs. IMO, it's best to install Linux without a hybrid MBR on Macs. You can check this detail with gdisk:\n$ sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nThis example shows a non-hybrid MBR, as identified by the MBR: protective line; a hybrid MBR will show MBR: hybrid instead. You can convert from hybrid to protective by saving the partition table in parted or GParted or by using the n option on gdisk's experts' menu and then saving the change via w (that is, x -> n -> w).\nBe aware, though, that if you're using a hybrid MBR, you may be booting Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, and removing the hybrid MBR will render the Mac unable to boot in that mode. This will necessitate installing an EFI-mode boot loader. (You can check your Ubuntu boot mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi -- if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.) Also, if you're triple-booting with Windows, you must normally have a hybrid MBR. Thus, you should not blindly remove the hybrid MBR, if one is present; instead, you should first assess whether you need it and then delete it only if you don't or if you have a plan to update your boot loader(s) appropriately.\nBeyond this, I agree with user68186: You should back up your data to an external disk or other external media. Risks to data loss go far beyond encryption problems and include things like physical loss of your laptop, catastrophic failure of your hard disk or SSD, accidental catastrophic mis-use of dd or other disk utilities, and so on.\n", "Q: Where can I find a compact list of basic commands for the root shell prompt? My computer is only stable in Recovery Mode. I want to save the files on the HDD before I format the disk and do a fresh OS install. Are the commands for the root shell prompt the same as the ones used in the terminal? Are they similar to the ones used for DOS? Any pointers?\n\nA: Depends.  I don't recall if ubuntu uses busybox, if so, your commands are those available in busybox.  To see a list, type this:\nbusybox --list\n\nOr\nbusybox -h\n\nBeyond that, available programs are determined by your PATH environment variable.  Generally, these are the same as those in the terminal.  Any executable that is in your PATH will be available as a command.  If there is a command you need, but it doesn't execute when you type it in, you might just need to update your path.  Be sure to include the previous value of path if you do this.  For example:\nexport PATH=~/bin:\"$PATH\"\n\nIn addition to executables in your PATH, you have some basic bash commands that are also available.  For a list of bash commands, type help.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not use busybox. The commands available to Recovery Mode are much the same as in other modes.

Is there a bug somewhere in the logrotate script? Does it need to restart nginx on a rotate ?\n\nA: You are running Ubuntu version 15.\nYes, you could muck around with logrotate and with script snippets as in the other answers.  But you are running Ubuntu version 15.  On your operating system services are run under systemd, which by default captures their standard error and syslog outputs and handles the logging.  There's no need for nginx to be writing to that error.log file in the first place.  There's no need for logrotate at all.\nOther answers and the comments beneath them may cause you to look at /etc/init.d/nginx perhaps.  Don't.  That file is irrelevant.  You are running Ubuntu version 15.  The relevant file, as provided right out of the box in the Ubuntu nginx-common package, is /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service which is what systemd will be using, completely ignoring the old /etc/init.d/nginx file which is entirely overridden by a proper systemd service unit file.\nOther answers might lead you to look at /etc/logrotate.d/nginx as well.  You might be mystified by the contradiction between what you can clearly see there, trying to run the old System 5 rc script with a non-standard invoke-rc.d subcommand, and the claim that there's no postrotate stanza.  But again, simply don't.  Don't focus on these logrotate control stanzas in the first place.  You are running Ubuntu version 15 with a package that has a system unit already and isn't using System 5 rc scripts on your operating system, and a service manager that logs service output.\nTwo steps to doing things the systemd way:\nConfigure nginx more appropriately.\nYour nginx service needs to be told to simply write its log to its standard error.  As a bonus, you can send your access log to the journal via syslog, which systemd also intercepts.\nThis is done with nginx global configuration directives and http module directives.  Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*error_log stderr ;\n\n*access_log syslog:server=unix:/dev/log ;\nYou either change your nginx.conf file to say these as this person did, or do what Alexander Kuznecov did here and change your nginx.service unit file to pass (global) directives on the nginx command line: Type=forking\nPIDFile=/run/nginx.pid\nExecStart=/usr/bin/nginx -g 'daemon on; error_log stderr; master_process on;'\nForget about logrotate entirely.\nsystemd puts the standard output and standard error of all services into its journal.  It handles the rotation of the journal files itself.  There are no signals and no nginx service reloading involved at all.  You can read the last few entries in the journal that are related to the service with (run as the superuser or as an adm user)systemctl status nginx.service  You can read everything in the log from that service since the last boot withjournalctl -u nginx.service -b\n\nA: The reason nginx is writing to the rotated file is a missing postrotate section in the logrotate file for nginx to reload the configuration of nginx. \nlogrotate has renamed the file all right but renaming does not closes or changes the file descriptor (kernel internally maintains a descriptor table that demonstrates all open files by file handles or descriptors), the file handle remains the same as it was previously. So the nginx process will keep on dumping to the same file handle (the rotated one) rather than the newly created file.\nTo solve this issue, add a postrotate section in the logrotate configuration file to reload the configuration file of nginx.\nFor example, here is the postrotate section of /etc/logrotate.d/apache2:\n    postrotate\n            if /etc/init.d/apache2 status > /dev/null ; then \\\n                /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null; \\\n            fi;\n    endscript\n\n\nA: Create a file /etc/logrotate.d/nginx with the following content. Works on debian at least. Your mileage may vary\n/var/log/nginx/*.log {\n    daily\n    missingok\n    rotate 99\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    notifempty\n    create 0640 www-data adm\n    sharedscripts\n    postrotate\n        /bin/kill -USR1 `cat /run/nginx.pid 2>/dev/null` 2>/dev/null || true\n    endscript\n}\n\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu Touch multitask like a desktop Ubuntu would?

In an Ubuntu phone application, I need to perform some logic when an event occurs.\nSince I don't want to pollute the QML with too many lines of JavaScript, I made a class in an external file and I connected the signal to one of its methods:\nMain.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport \"action.js\" as ActionJs\n\nMainView {\n    objectName: \"mainView\"\n\n    applicationName: \"example.cos64\"\n\n    useDeprecatedToolbar: false\n\n    width: units.gu(20)\n    height: units.gu(20)\n\n    Page {\n\n        Button {\n            id: clickMeButton\n\n            text: \"Click me\"\n\n            onClicked: {\n                console.log('clicked');\n            }\n\n            Component.onCompleted: {\n                var action = new ActionJs.Action();\n                clickMeButton.clicked.connect(action.handleClick)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\naction.js\nfunction Action() {\n\n    this.handleClick = function() {\n        console.log('handleClick');\n        this.process();\n    }\n\n    this.process = function() {\n        console.log('processing...')\n    }\n}\n\nIt works, but I can't call any other method from the slot:\nStarting /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmlscene...\nqml: clicked\nqml: handleClick\nfile:///home/co64/projects/ubuntu/Example/action.js:5: TypeError: Property 'process' of object [object Object] is not a function\n\nWhy is 'process' not recognized as a function?\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: I believe the immediate problem is that the context changes inside the function definitions inside Action.  The this object inside Action.handleClick() is Action.handleClick, not Action.\nBut let's back up a little bit: why are you using the function-inside-a-function paradigm here?  This is common in browser Javascript, since there is no namespacing in that environment.  To avoid trampling other functions, you fake a namespace by creating an object to hold all of your functions.\nHowever, QML does do namespacing.  Note that you had to reference Action as ActionJS.Action from the QML file.  Therefore, there's no need implement another namespace for your functions; just put them in the top level of the JS file:\nfunction handleClick() {\n    console.log(\"handleClick\");\n    process();\n}\n\nfunction process() {\n    console.log(\"processing...\");\n}\n\nThen in your QML file, do\nComponent.onCompleted: {\n    clickMeButton.clicked.connect(ActionJS.handleClick)\n}\n\nOr, just\nonClicked: ActionJS.handleClick()\n\nI'm assuming here that you don't actually need an Action object for anything other than namespacing.

I've got a Toshiba L845 (that comes with W8 pre-installed) and after having so many problems I decided to go to Linux. \nI do not want to keep W8 (since I can not even start it due to a blue screen error that cost U$S 400 to be fix according to toshiba).\nI've been trying to install Ubuntu through USB. I have correctly \"burn\" the ISO in another computer and have fixed all the UEFI and Secure BIOS issued.\nThe copy boots perfectly, but on the main menu of the installation when I click on \"Install Ubuntu\" the computer keeps restarting all the time. It comes up with the Ubuntu installation menu and then it restarts again and again.\nDoes someone have the same problem? What can I do to fix it? Please consider that I have no access to Windows. I just have my USB stick and the computer. \n\nA: The fact that somebody's asking $400 to fix a blue-screen problem in Windows suggests the possibility that the computer has a hardware fault. That's far from certain, though (you haven't said how much diagnosis went into this repair estimate). If I had to guess, I'd say you might have a damaged hard disk. You can check this by running a SMART test, as described here.\nYou can determine your boot mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi -- if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If my bad-disk hypothesis is correct, this detail is irrelevant; but if something else is going on, knowing the boot mode may be important. Changing the boot mode might or might not be possible, depending on how you created your USB drive. If it is possible, it will be done by using the firmware's built-in boot manager (typically accessed via a function key as the computer starts) and selecting the appropriate boot option -- the description of the boot medium usually includes \"UEFI\" to boot in that mode and omits \"UEFI\" to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n", "Q: D-Link DWA 127 Rev.

It is possible the Router is not creating the packet and sending it correctly.  It is also possible your firewall rules at the router are blocking the packets.  It is also possible the packets are just not being created the way you think they are.  You should start by trying to direct actual UDP packets at the server, such as DNS queries directed at the server instead of an actual DNS server.\nUnfortunately, though, without further information on the infrastructure and setup on BOTH ends of the network (your router/LAN, and your server, specifically what kind of server, if there's a firewall between the server and the internet, or whether it's an EC2 or such), we can't say more about what could be the problem.\n", "Q: GPT vs MBR. Why not MBR? I am a Linux user. I don't have Windows on my laptop. Also the hard drive size is less than 2 TB. Then why should I use GPT tables? Can't I go with old fasioned MBR?\nI will be having two root partitions, two home partitions, and a swap space. So when a partition is not primary, but is extended, does that make any performance difference?\n\nA: There are several advantages to GPT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Supports disks larger than 2TiB.\n\n*Supports partitions larger than 2TiB.\n\n*Supports more than four partitions, with no distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions.\n\n*Uses GUIDs as type codes, which means there's less risk of conflicting/duplicate codes.\n\n*Uses LBA addressing exclusively, compared to MBR's dual use of LBA and CHS. (Even on MBR, CHS is useless on disks over about 8GB, though, so there's little risk of real conflict on modern hard disks, which are much bigger than this.)\n\n*Provides duplicate partition table structures at the start and end of the disk, which makes recovery from some types of user errors, bugs, and disk damage possible.\n\n*Provides checksums of important data structures, which enables detection of some types of partition table damage.\n\n*Provides a UTF partition description field, so you can give your partitions names. Note that this is independent of the name of the filesystem contained in the partition.\n\n*Is used natively by EFI/UEFI firmware.\n\n\nNote the difference between a tebibyte (TiB; 1024^4 bytes) and a terabyte (TB; 1000^4 bytes). The former are IEEE-1541 units, whereas the latter are SI units. For most disk measurements, IEEE-1541 units are more natural. Some documentation and software (especially older stuff) mis-applies SI suffixes to IEEE-1541 measurements, which is confusing.\nMost of these advantages are minor ones for most installations. The two most important advantages are the fact that GPT is the natural partitioning scheme for EFI and the lack of primary/extended/logical distinction. The other GPT advantages combined are worth noting, but are not overwhelming issues for most people.\nMost computers introduced since mid-2011, including the vast majority of systems that shipped with Windows 8 and later, use EFI firmware. If you boot such a computer in EFI mode (rather than using the CSM, which enables BIOS-mode booting), using GPT is something of a default. If you boot (or dual-boot) Windows in EFI mode, using GPT is required (it's a Windows limitation). IIRC, Ubuntu won't install to an MBR disk in EFI mode, either, but you could probably convert partition table type and get it to boot after installing it. Booting from an MBR disk in EFI mode is poorly tested, though, and might fail on some EFIs.\nThe primary/extended/logical distinction of MBR is an awkward hack that was created in the 1980s to get around the four-partition limit of MBR. GPT defaults to supporting 128 partitions, but that limit can be raised if it's absolutely required. MBR logical partitions are no slower to access than primary partitions, but they are more prone to damage because of the fact that they rely on a linked-list data structure that spans multiple sectors scattered throughout the disk. The biggest problem is simply dealing with hassles like running out of primary partitions or handling partition resize operations that involve both primary and logical partitions (and that therefore also requires resizing an extended partition, which is an extra operation -- and an extra chance for something to go wrong).\nIf you're booting in BIOS mode on a sub-2TiB disk, it's probably best to stick with MBR, simply because there are some BIOSes that don't react well to booting from GPT disks. Such problems can usually be worked around, but it's easier not to run into the problems in the first place. Using GPT on a BIOS-based computer will also prevent you from installing Windows on that system. If you know what you're doing and want to use GPT, though, using GPT in BIOS mode for an Ubuntu installation is do-able, and I won't discourage you from doing so -- but if you run into problems you may need to troubleshoot it.\nAs most modern computers use EFI, though, GPT may be semi-required -- if you boot in EFI mode. If you use BIOS/CSM/legacy mode on such a computer, sticking to MBR is still preferable, for the reasons just noted. FWIW, my recommendation at this point, if you've got the choice, is to disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support and use EFI mode exclusively on EFI-based computers. This simplifies the boot path and makes it less likely that you'll run into problems. The trouble is that there's a lot of bad advice out there to do the contrary, which creates more problems than it solves, in my estimation. (A search on this site, for instance, reveals numerous problems caused by cross-mode OS installations and other issues related to using BIOS/CSM/legacy mode on an EFI-based computer.)\nIf you've got an over-2TiB disk, you pretty much must use GPT. The main exception to this is if the disk uses a 4096-byte logical sector size, which raises the 2TiB MBR limit to 16TiB. Some external disks do this, and I've heard of some high-end internal disks that do it, too. (Note that many disks have 4096-byte physical sectors and 512-byte logical sectors. They have the same 2TiB MBR limit as disks with 512-byte physical and logical sectors.)\n\nA: It will make no difference for you at all. Advantages of GPT are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Large partitions, more that 2 TB\n\n*Unlimited number of primary partitions\n\n\nIn your case you do not need first. Second can be achieved by creating an extended partition and creating logical ones there.\nFor linux it does not matter to which type of partitions install (logical or primary). But with GPT it may be slightly more handy to move partitions if needed, because they will all be primary.\nThere is no performance difference at all.\nAll other \"advantages\" of GPT are so minor, that it is not worth to mention.\n\nA: I've been wondering about this for months.  Here's a Windows answer to your question: GPT appears to me to be significantly faster.  I've not found any test results to date that support what I have below, though I've found many guesses that the performance difference is negligible other than at startup.  I'm not so sure now.  Here's my tuppence worth:\nI have a 2TB Samsung D3 USB 3.0 external drive.  I had it split into two MBR partitions approx 1TB each.  My PC is Windows 10 64bit, Asus Z97-P m/b, 8GB memory, i5 4460 CPU.  I ran a CrystalDiskMark x64 test 3 times on it while it was formatted using MBR and got this:\nMBR average results (all MB/s): \n- Read SEQ Q32T1 40\n- Read 4K Q32T1 1.47\n- Read SEQ 142\n- Read 4K 1.22\n- Write SEQ Q32T1 101\n- Write 4K Q32T1 8.7\n- Write SEQ 112\n- Write 4K 8.5\nHaving a sadly large amount of spare time, I backed off the data (about 750GB), reformatted to GPT, in this case as a single 2TB partition, copied the data back to the disk, and ran the tests again:\nGPT average results (all MB/s): \n- Read SEQ Q32T1 165\n- Read 4K Q32T1 1.83\n- Read SEQ 170\n- Read 4K 1.5\n- Write SEQ Q32T1 135\n- Write 4K Q32T1 8.7\n- Write SEQ 138\n- Write 4K 8.6\nSo the SEQ Q32T1 results are much, much higher with GPT, and all other results are higher with GPT though surely not always significantly.\nI'm certainly no expert as regards the actual everyday significance of these differences, but I'm tempted now to use GPT whenever I think I can get away with it (ie avoid old operating systems that can't read it).\n", "Q: How can I create a debian package for MediaWiki 1.25.1? I would like to create an easily installable debian package (.deb file) for MediaWiki 1.25.1 as I know from personal experience that for web programming noobs like myself, installing MediaWiki can seem like an impossible task. \nI have read some guides on how to create debian packages, like this one for Ubuntu users and this one on Debian Wiki, but correct me if I'm wrong but they only seem to mention packages that are installed via the make utility, while MediaWiki, being a Wiki application is installed (if you could even call it an installation) by creating an Apache & MySQL server database for the Wiki and running the setup scripts. But I know such a debian package can be made as there exists a really old version of MediaWiki in the PPA repositories (1.19) and it is a debian package. \nI know the basic procedure of what any such package would need to do, namely (you should note that I'm getting much of this from my own memory plus this article at mediwiki.org):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install LAMP, or at a bare minimum install the packages apache2, mysql-server, php5, php5-mysql and libapache2-mod-php5. Possibly via sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5. \n\n*Install some additional packages (strictly speaking they're optional, but they're incredibly helpful, especially if you're new to MediaWiki) such as imagemagick, inkscape, php5-cli and phpmyadmin, also via sudo apt-get install... It would be grand if an GUI could pop up during installation and prompt users as to which of these optional packages should be installed. Such an interface could also go through the process of setting a MySQL password)\n\n*Extract the tarball of MediaWiki 1.25.1 into /var/lib/mediawiki\n\n*Create a virtual link between /var/lib/mediawiki and /var/www/html/mediawiki (by running sudo ln -s /var/lib/mediawiki /var/www/html/mediawiki)\n\n*Run mysql_secure_installation\n\n*Configure PHP (optional to the user) and restart Apache after. \n\n*Configure Apache (more details on the mediawiki.org article I hyperlinked)\n\n*Open browser to http://localhost/mediawiki to complete MediaWiki configuration. \n\n\nI just don't know how to create a debian package that would do this. So all in all I would like someone's help so I may do this, so that MediaWiki installation on Ubuntu may be made that little bit easier for future users. \nMy attempt at creating a package myself\nI created a directory, /home/fusion809/Debian packaging/bzr so I can try following this guide on the mediawiki-1.25.1.tar.gz tarball. I got down to here in the guide and the debian package I created (by running the bzr builddeb... command in my /home/fusion809/Debian packaging/bzr/mediawiki/debian directory) was only 2.4 kB in size (where the tarball is 23.7 MB) and gave the error message:\ninstall-info: warning: no info dir entry in `/usr/share/info/lilypond/pictures/ross-beam-scan.jpg'\ninstall-info: warning: no info dir entry in `/usr/share/info/lilypond/pictures/carter-brey.jpg'\ninstall-info: warning: no info dir entry in `/usr/share/info/lilypond/pictures/darius-blasband.jpg'\ninstall-info: warning: no info dir entry in `/usr/share/info/lilypond/pictures/orm-finnendahl.jpg'\ninstall-info: warning: no info dir entry in `/usr/share/info/mime.info.gz'\n\nwhen I tried to install it. If you're wondering what my control file looks like, here it is: \nSource: mediawiki\nSection: unknown\nPriority: optional\nMaintainer: Brenton Horne <brentonhorne77@gmail.com>\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 9)\nStandards-Version: 3.9.5\nHomepage: <insert the upstream URL, if relevant>\n#Vcs-Git: git://anonscm.debian.org/collab-maint/mediawiki.git\n#Vcs-Browser: http://anonscm.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/mediawiki.git;a=summary\n\nPackage: mediawiki\nArchitecture: all\nDepends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}\nDescription: MediaWiki, a free wiki application.\n  MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki application written in PHP that is maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation. It depends on\n  Apache, MySQL and PHP.\n\nmy rules file looks like:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n# See debhelper(7) (uncomment to enable)\n# output every command that modifies files on the build system.\n#DH_VERBOSE = 1\n\n# see EXAMPLES in dpkg-buildflags(1) and read /usr/share/dpkg/*\nDPKG_EXPORT_BUILDFLAGS = 1\ninclude /usr/share/dpkg/default.mk\n\n# see FEATURE AREAS in dpkg-buildflags(1)\n#export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+all\n\n# see ENVIRONMENT in dpkg-buildflags(1)\n# package maintainers to append CFLAGS\n#export DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND  = -Wall -pedantic\n# package maintainers to append LDFLAGS\n#export DEB_LDFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND = -Wl,--as-needed\n\n\n# main packaging script based on dh7 syntax\n%:\n    dh $@ \n\n# debmake generated override targets\n# This is example for Cmake (See http://bugs.debian.org/641051 )\n#override_dh_auto_configure:\n#   dh_auto_configure -- \\\n#   -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)\n\n\nA: Packages in Debian/Ubuntu don't have to be built using make. Technically, in debian/rules, there are just certain targets that have to be met. The following is what I (and Debian's Flightgear group) use to copy files from an arch-independent tarball (no compiling involved, just copying files) into the package.\n%:\n    dh $@\n\noverride_dh_auto_install:\n    dh_installdirs -pflightgear-data-aircrafts-ec130 usr/share/games/flightgear/Aircraft/ec130\n\n    find -maxdepth 1 ! -name 'debian' -exec cp -r \"{}\" \\\n       debian/flightgear-data-aircrafts-ec130/usr/share/games/flightgear/Aircraft/ec130 \\;\n\n# Fix some insane permissions\n    find $(CURDIR)/debian/flightgear-data-*/usr/share/games/flightgear \\\n        -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\n# Drop some silly Windows PE32 executable files\n    find $(CURDIR)/debian -type f -iname \"*.mdl\" -delete\n\n# Drop empty directories\n    find $(CURDIR)/debian -type d -empty -delete\n\nBasically, override_dh_auto_install just copies files form the source tarball into the final package, and removes some unneeded files. Because there is no \"compiling\" file in the source tarball, some of the other targets do nothing.\nYou can follow something like this (along with using the postinst and prerm scripts) to automate the steps you've mentioned. Note that the installation of additional packages would go into debian/control, either as Depends, Recommends, or Suggests.\n\nA: I'd recommend using uupdate from devscripts to get good start for your deb package.\nInstall required packages\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts\n\nDownload the the old package from official repository and the new tar-ball from upstream. (I'm using 14.04)\n$ mkdir ~/Downloads/mediawiki\n$ cd ~/Downloads/mediawiki\n$ apt-get source mediawiki\n$ wget http://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.25/mediawiki-1.25.1.tar.gz\n\nRun uupdate to create a new source folder from the upstream tar-ball and the old debian/control\n$ cd mediawiki-1.19.14+dfsg   # depends on your Ubuntu version\n$ uupdate ../mediawiki-1.25.1.tar.gz 1.25.1\n$ cd ../mediawiki-1.25.1\n\nNow you should check if you need to make changes to debian/control etc files. If you're done you can build the deb package and install it\n$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc\n$ cd ..\n$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n", "Q: Can't access internet in KVM virtual machine running RHEL I have the VM running on 14.04.

I am very perplexed as to why it may be happening.\nAn interesting clue: about a week ago, I was trying to move some files around into a folder that I use for music, and I was unable to. The computer told me that it was a read only folder. I knew that this wasn't true, but alas I tried to change its permissions using chmod 777. Despite this, the situation remained the same. I decided to restart my computer, and that is when the next problem began.\nWhen it boots, it asks me for my two encryption passwords, then gets permanently stuck with its loading icon of flowing dots.\nI have gone to the GRUB and ran the system in recovery mode. From there, I have performed both dpkg and fsck. Once on that screen, if I choose the normal boot option, the computer is able to boot, run programs, etc. It still seems a little strange though, like the graphics are a little wonky. \nAfter that, the computer is still unable to boot from a cold start. \nI really have no idea what is wrong with it.

Also, when I first installed Ubuntu I had to restart the computer and at this point I had a black screen for a very long time, is this normal?\nThanks\n\nA: The black screen may have been a prompt for you to enter your encryption password - just a guess from experience.

I'm trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, but not within Windows. I want to use Grub as the bootloader instead of the Windows MBR. I was installing off the liveDVD for 15.04, the amd64 version.\nWhen confronted with the partitioning screen, I realized I didn't really know what to partition. My /dev/sda2 partition is the biggest, at 734GB. But, that's labeled as Windows Recovery Environment. \nHere's my partioning screen\nSorry for the crappy photo, but I don't know how to screenshot from this screen. \nI also don't know which partition to put the bootloader on. The default is /dev/sda, but it also has options to do /dev/sda's 1-4. \nI also don't know what I need in terms of a swap partition. Isn't this where the bootloader should be? How big does this partition need to be?\nThanks so much!\n\nA: The grub bootloader, if you want it as your loader for multiple OSes, goes on the first bootable drive, which would be /dev/sda, and not the partitions.  Even Windows installs its bootloader to the MBR of the drive.  That is also where grub would install to, but it will scan all your partitions for boot files.  So, your Windows would still boot correctly.\nLooking at your pic there, I see the 15GB partition is actually your Windows Recovery partition, and your 736GB partition is that of your actual Windows installation.  If you are not planning on using that much space to Windows, I would recommend shrinking /dev/sda2 down and installing Ubuntu into the new blank area.  But, as a safety precaucion of your data, first back up your data from Windows before you resize any partitions, as there is always the chance of something going wrong and messing up all your partitions.\n", "Q: Can a Mumble Server be hosted on a Ubuntu desktop?

So I just had to trust it on the server by following this guide and now everything works perfectly.\n", "Q: Can't boot into graphical desktop after installing SELinux I have a problem trying to get gui environment to bootup after installing selinux.

I can do this by executing iwconfig wlan0 repeatedly on remote machine. But how to login to that machine and execute this command via telnet. I can do this via ssh, but ssh takes time to login and it hangs if connection to remote machine drops in the middle of execution.\n\nA: Instead of repeatedly invoking the ssh command, you could run ssh to repeatedly execute the command on the remote system and then parse and use the output locally.  Then you wouldn't have to keep running the ssh connection and putting up with the initial lag.\nFor example:\nssh remotehost \"while [ \"1\" ] ; do iwconfig wlan0 ; sleep 1 ; done\"\n\nOr, you could use netcat to send the output on the remote system back to your machine.  For example, run this on the local machine:\nnc -l 9999\n\nThen on the remote machine:\nwhile [ \"1\" ] ; do iwconfig wlan0 ; sleep 1 | nc localmachine 9999\n\nReplace localmachine here with the host or ip of the machine that will be doing the \"monitoring\".\nYou could even pipe the output from nc reading that port into another command.\nCloser to your actual question, you could do this on the remote system to act as a telnet \"server\":\nwhile [ \"1\" ] ; do iwconfig wlan0 | nc -l 9999 ; done\n\nThen you could do this to get the outupt:\ntelnet remotehost 9999\n\n", "Q: removing \"_\" from a very large csv file I have a large csv file (120GB) that looks like this:\n\"JE\",865438083645,2012-12-05T23:07:36.000Z,24,\"NQ\",142,\"658_55525\",475035504705\n\"JE\",875619112765,2012-12-05T23:58:04.000Z,4,\"PG\",144,\"219_9221\",835399289335\n\"JE\",125495251245,2012-12-05T18:16:06.000Z,206,\"PLJE\",153,\"763_60771\",445355650435\n\nI would like to remove the underscore and the quotation marks from the values in the seventh column (e.g., \"658_55525\" becomes 65855525).

Could anyone help me out? I am a beginner so, Step by step process preferred.\n\nA: It is a shame to hear that you are leaving Ubuntu. I too can understand your frustration, but if you stick with it, it is all worth it in the end. I too was frustrated, but stuck with it as I was fed up of windows trying to rule the world.\nNow I personally feel that the gui is more user friendly that most others. With regards to the programs, you have the option of using Wine to run windows files. Also there are so many alternatives to the mainstream programs in the software centre and they are all free. Yes it takes a bit to get used to them, but when you are not paying you don't seem to mind as much.\nIf you have not got drive to back your files on to, have a look at installing an on-line cloud folder such as 'Copy'. I have this and it is good. You could back up stuff to it and know it is safe. This link will show you how to do it:\nInstall Copy\nHave you thought about setting up a virtual box to install windows within ubuntu until you can sort things out. That way you can have both at the same time and know that your files are safe.\n\nA: Before uninstalling anything, in Ubuntu open the file manager( looks like a file cabinet) and mount your Windows partition by just clicking on it. Find the files you want to save and cut and paste to the Windows drive in a directory you are familiar with. Next open a terminal and type: locate mbr.bin  Next write down the location then type: dd if=(the location)/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda This should write over the grub that boots Ubuntu. Once back in Windows open Adminstrator services and go to disk storage. You will be able to delete the drive the Ubuntu os was on.\n\nA: OK I have a few Pointers to for you. Though I hate it that you are moving away from Ubuntu to Windows 7.\nI have been a Windows System Architect for my whole life, My bread and butter is because of Microsoft's Software. However I still use Linux/Ubuntu on all my personal Systems because Linux is superior to Windows in Every Possible Way.\nWith that out of the way, Here is the solution for you.\n1) You can recover your Data from Ubuntu back to Windows without an External Drive, Only if you already have a Windows Installation on the Same system.

If you're on windows, you can follow these instructions which uses the Pen Drive Linux's USB Installer to write the image to the drive. \nOnce you've done that you need to boot from your usb drive (usually hitting F8 or F9 at the BIOS stage) or you change the boot order in the BIOS itself. You'll then be presented with a menu where you can Install Ubuntu or Try Ubuntu without Installation. The latter does exactly what you want: It boots Ubuntu without touching your internal drives. The system will entirely be held in the computer's memory, might however feel slow due to the nature of USB drives. \n\nA: To try Ubuntu without installation you have many choices, the easiest is \n\n\n*\n\n*Try the Ubuntu Live CD\n\n*Make a USB bootable \n\n*Try Ubuntu In a Virtual Machine\n\n\nThe Ubuntu Live CD is just a normal Ubuntu ISO burned to a CD/DVD, once you start booting from CD you'll be prompt with some menu. One Option of this menu is try Ubuntu without installing so you can choose it and this will boot the Ubuntu Live CD so you can  try Ubuntu as you like, but you should notice that every thing you do it will just wiped when you reboot unless you save your work to a storage media.\n\nAnother Option which you may be asking about is to make a bootable USB.

To get past my PC's 2 TB limit I have used Acronis Extended Capacity Manager to gain access to hard drive space beyond the 2 TB limit. I have ran live versions of Ubuntu and I would like to dual boot, or triple boot my PC, Windows 8.1 & Ubuntu & other. When I run the live version of Ubuntu, or any other Linux distro, my extended disk space is not seen by Linux. How can I get Ubuntu to see my extended disk space?\n\nA: I'm not intimately familiar with the software, but based on the description on its Web site, it sounds like this is a non-standard Windows driver that makes a disk look like two or more physical disks to Windows. If I'm right, the only way to access such a disk in Linux would be to write an equivalent driver for Linux, and AFAIK no such driver exists.\nThat said, the question is why you used this software in the first place. You say you're running Windows 8.1. If the computer shipped with this software, it almost certainly booted in EFI mode and used the GUID Partition Table (GPT) for partitioning. GPT supports over-2TiB disks, so there'd be no reason to use any third-party stuff. Even if you installed Windows yourself in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, you could use GPT on a 4TiB data disk; only the boot disk is limited to using MBR in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If the computer is newer than about 2011, it probably supports EFI-mode booting. Thus, you might want to re-consider your system configuration at a fundamental level:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your computer is BIOS-only (as are most pre-mid-2011 machines), you may be somewhat stuck -- but even then, using a sub-2TiB boot disk and your 4TB disk as a GPT data disk should work. Note that you can install Linux to a GPT disk even in BIOS mode; tying GPT to EFI is a Windows limitation, not a BIOS issue, and Linux does not share Windows' limitation on this score.\n\n*If your computer has an EFI, you can re-install Windows in EFI mode. This will use GPT, which supports your full disk capacity.\n\n\nThe problem with either approach, though, is that you'll need to back up your personal data and restore it after you're done re-installing.\n\nA: You can get and run the Seagate Extended Capacity manager directly from Seagate, and it does not require any Acronis Software. Also, remove the Intel Rapid store Drivers, I had to in order to make the Seagate product work. Since the Seagate product is ONLY for Windows, make sure all of the data you place into the new Extended Partition, is not of great importance. I would put ONLY windows software originals and other media photos videos etc stuff. Why?\nWell as you can see if you put valuable data in there, did a backup of the 3 or plus you corrupt the 3 TB or larger drive, you will have no direct means of recovering it in a disaster situation. So you could store non-valuable data, knowing that you would be forced to reinstall the extended capacity and then use Acronis or Macrium to restore the partitions folder back, in the event of Full recovery, because Acronis or Macrium rescue will backup the Seagate extended partition, but you will not be able to restore it using the bootable recovery media. You can restore it later on after formatting the second partition later on. Potentially however and not yet having had to, it may allow by doing partition recovery, from the Windows-created recovery media, by doing it from within windows. So you could recover the windows drive partition and then recover the extended capacity partition later by installing the extended capacity manager onto your system and windows folders and then restoring the folders back to the extended partition later from within windows itself and whatever backup software you used, even the one from the recovery DVD or Windows Install DVD.

Indeed the forwards will not affect your internal DNS this is used when caching to the outer domains.\nIn order to understand bind9 with ubuntu it's better to read more about before starting your configuration.\nyou can read the official documentation from here.\nAnother great tutorial can get from here\nPlease refer to this link How do I do a complete BIND9 DNS Server Configuration with a hostname? you can find your needs in detail\n", "Q: Even after removing vlan entry in /etc/network interfaces file, ifconfig is showing the interface I had set up a vlan in interfaces file. Later on, even after removing the entries and restarting network, the ifconfig command is displaying that interface. Even ifdown isnt taking it down. Ifdown throws error message that the interface isnt configured.\nEven after multiple times of examination, I am seeing the same thing again. Wondering why it worked in the same way in the Oracle VM Virtual Box also.\nEven after commenting-out in the interfaces file, networking restart, networking stop / start, ifdown && ifup, even machine reboot also..!! \nSame experience..!! \nCould somebody please try this and explain..?\n\nA: If anybody comes across this now, I hope this helps!\nUnfortunately, in order to get the interface to go away, you will need to re-create a valid config; this could be as simple as\nDEVICE=eth2.508\nBOOTPROTO=none\nVLAN=yes\n\nBring up the interface with\nifup eth2.508\n\nIf successful, you can then bring the interface back down\nifdown eth2.508\n\nAt this point, you should see the interface removed from ifconfig, and can safely move the config file from your network scripts folder.\nThe lesson to be learned from this is to bring down an interface before deleting it!\nI also strongly recommend moving the configs to an archive directory instead of deleting them in case a situation arises that it becomes required/desired again. On my CentOS servers, I would do\ncd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts\nmkdir if-archive\nmv ./eth2.508 ./if-archive/eth2.508.20170621-01\n\nYou'll notice the filename has yyyymmdd-vv appended to it; the -vv is for if you have multiple configs from the same date, you can manually increment this to keep multiple copies. If you don't have a need, don't add it.\n\nA: I had this problem while I used Netplan to add a VLAN on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic. It did no go away when I removed it from the Yaml file. I even wan't able to create a new VLAN with the same VLAN ID because the previous one was not removed.\nI solved this using this command:\nip link delete name [VLAN-NAME]\n\n\nA: Edit /etc/network/interfaces \nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nRemove the vlan entries \nNow you have to restart the interface \nsudo ifdown eth0 \n\nyou can ignore the error if it appears here\nthen \nsudo ifup etho \n\nNow check again ifconfig\nIf it still shows that entry you may need to make a system reboot.\n", "Q: I cant open dropbox i am install dropbox on ubuntu software center but i cant open dropbox.

I have about 2 weeks of experience with 'linux and friends' as of today and I'm at least a little proud of what I've achieved, but I'm at a loss right now as I can't find solutions to my problems. I want to make all regular users invisible, one already is(the template-user for the guest), so there's only the guest-account to choose from.\nI want this for numerous reasons, we run an big indoor playground, so a lot of nosy kids and dumbfound parents(of which 99% are indoctrinated with windows... like me) will be using these computers. Limiting their choices will mean less questions, which is good, since no one other than me will be able to answer, and I ain't there all of the time.\nTL;DR-ish:\nSo this is what I'm wondering:\nIf all regular users are invisible, and since guest has no privileges, how do I log in to them if I need to change anything? (I don't want manual login-screen)\nMore relevant info/thoughts: invisibility is setup by editing /var/lib/AccountsService/users/user-file and changing SystemAccount=false to true. I've skimmed by something saying you could set userid below 1000 to achieve the same result, would this method change anything regarding my problem, you know, like making it easier?\nCan I do something from the TTY? (what ever that is, it really confuses me, what separates it from the normal Ctrl+Alt+T terminal?)\nMaybe I'm going at this the wrong way, is there a boot-menu or something I could use to gain access? And if so, can I block little potential junior hackers from using it?\nHope that helps you help me, if there's something unclear or something you need to know, just ask away. :)\n\nA: The first thing to do is to choose strong password with at least 16 characters.\nTTY or console is just a non graphical terminal.\nguest is a restricted account with limited privileges and you can't sudo with that account.\nYour only option if you have disabled the other admin account on the login screen, is to switch to a console (aka use ctrl-alt-f1) and do your administration work there. This will mean using only the command line, so you need to improve your cli-fu to be fluent with it.\nMainly you need to know apt-get, dpkg, apt-cache, apt-file, nano\nDisable TTYs\nAnd you can disable ttys also, but then the only way to administer the PC will be via ssh (if it is connected to a LAN), given you have installed and configured openssh-server correctly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the ability to switch to TTYs (Ctrl+Alt+F1…F6)\n\n*How can I reduce the number of TTYs?\n\nA: Welcome to Linux!\nI have a very hacky and inelegant way that might work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the TTY by typing for instance Ctr+Alt+F1\n\n*Login as the user you would like to switch to (administrator)\n\n*Type the command startx to start the GUI of this user\n\n*Then, once in this session (Ctr+Alt+F8), open a terminal by pressing Ctr+Alt+T\n\n*Type unity to restart unity.\n\n\nIt will still be a bit buggy but it worked for me.\n", "Q: how to install libGL files I was just wondering what command I would use in front or behind a file name to install (I am very new to Linux and nothing seems to work for me, not even steam).\n\nA: Most probably you'll want apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx.

I'm wondering why there are so many applications for the same purpose but for different desktop environments. Like the burning software Brasero for Gnome and K3B for KDE. Isn't this reinventing the wheel all the time? Why not collaborate?\n\nA: A more efficient question would be: Why there is so many distributions that look the same except for the logo!\nEven though this may have some disadvantages as you said of reinventing the wheel, but this has many advantages. This is freedom which Linux and open source stands for.\nThis is power of Linux. The diversity, you can find many alternatives for the same application.\nThis is not weakness instead this is powerful, a person who uses Linux can have many choices to work on.\nPlus, each software comes from a different background with different programming language, also developers have their personal attitude.\nAn important point to list here, that most of applications in Linux are community based, with non-profit developers which means those developers don't have a single company to work in, though collaboration needs union and founding a company to sponsor and direct.\nAnother note: Also you should note that in really most of these applications are not really reinventing the wheel, most of them depend on the same core packages, differences mostly on appearance. For example, k3b and brasero are both depend on same core package cdrecord and wodim.\n\nA: The short answer is because (at least in theory) all the software runs better, more efficiently and more cohesively that way.\nThe long answer is that the aim of most desktop environments is to provide for most of a user's basic needs and the people who work on these projects have different ideas about how to get this job done. So, they're all creating software that represents their ideals for meeting those needs.\nGNOME has Gedit, Brasero and other GTK-based software because it will run smoothly, doesn't require additional frameworks and fits in with what the GNOME developers see as an ideal desktop experience. Meanwhile, KDE has software that's based on QT (another software framework) and is representative of what the KDE folks view as being the better desktop experience.\nThe reason they're not making software together is because their views of design are totally different. Developing software is both art and science. GNOME, KDE, Unity and any other desktop you can think of is developed by people who are creating what they want to see on the desktop.\nAnd on top of all of that, as I hinted at before, this stuff is all built on different frameworks. GNOME uses GTK, KDE uses QT, etc. When you build everything for the same framework and environment it fits together really nicely and it usually runs a little better. So, keeping the software \"in the family\" helps development in that aspect as well.\nI just use the default Ubuntu desktop (Unity) and I usually don't care if an app is KDE or GTK-specific, though. Whatever software works best for me is what I'll use. You always have that lovely freedom of choice with Ubuntu and Linux in general!\n", "Q: lsusb is not working on Ubuntu?

I have downloaded Ubuntu iso file. But I am not able to write it to USB as in Debian, I am unable to install unetbootin both from repository and direct download as nothing happens when I double click the unetbootin file even though it is marked executable. I tried various other command options, also searched on google but all solutions had some problems. Please advice me how to make my USB bootable with Ubuntu preferably with unetbootin.\n\nA: The preferred way to make a bootable usb in debian is using dd. so:\n\nsudo dd if=/path_to/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/usb-mount-point\n\nwill write the contents of ubuntu.iso file to usb-mount-point. You have to see where you have mounted the USB (you can use sudo fdisk -l to see (usually it will be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc). \nIt is important to be absolutely sure of the mount point of usb before running the dd command.\n\nA: The one and only supported way to \"burn\" an ISO image to a USB drive (memory stick) is the \"USB Creator\" tool aka \"Startup Disk Creator\".\nIt basically does some conversion and then copies the stuff onto the USB device.\nBe warned that the USB device content will be wiped as a result for the whole process!\n", "Q: Will updating the BIOS remove my Ubuntu EFI entry?

The booting option now is controlled by your system BIOS, so that you have each time to choose which harddisk to boot from and thus boot the needed OS.\nAnyway, To install Ubuntu now on the second harddrive you can keep the Windows HDD pluged but you should be careful to choose the right drive to install Ubuntu on(the free drive), and since this have some rescue I advise you to unplug the Windows drive from your Pc, then Install Ubuntu on the second drive then replug again the Windows.\nDon't forget you have to choose the HDD to boot from the BIOS.\n", "Q: Evolution can't connect to google contacts Hy guys,\nif I want to view my gmail contacts in evolution, I get this: \n\"requested ressource was not found\" and then a link which leads me to the google developers, as if I was a developer.\nEmail works without any problems.

I'm dual booting Ubuntu and Elementary OS.\nIs there a way I can auth myself as a Elemantary OS user and access my files under Ubuntu home folder and vice-versa?\n\n\nA: You wont need to authenticate yourself as an Elementary OS user from Ubuntu or as an Ubuntu user from Elementary OS.  You just have to have the same UID on both systems.  Then, mounting the file system under either OS will allow you to have regular user access.\nIf you want the files to always be accessible, create an /etc/fstab entry for each of the operating systems from within the each other operating system.  Here's an overly long explanation of how to do that: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\nAlso, you would need to create a new directory under each OS where the home directory can be mounted for the other.\nIf the systems have different user IDs, you could add a new user account to each operating system.  Either redundantly set your passwords for each system manually, or create a new user account on each system and copy the password line from /etc/shadow of one system into /etc/shadow of the other.  But be extremely careful that you only copy the one line.  Screw this file up and you'll have to boot up in recovery mode to fix your passwords.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu Mate 15.04 on a Raspberry 2 without display and keyboard?

I have a 2007 Mac Mini that has reached the end of its useful life. It won't run anything newer than OSX 10.7.5.

Good luck.\n\nA: I own a 20-inch mid 2007 iMac (iMac7,1). I was able to boot ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso from a DVD and USB flash drive. I used instructions posted here to create the flash drive. The DVD verified OK, but the flash drive listed an error in 1 file. I did successfully install Ubuntu to an external disk using the DVD. Have yet to test using the flash drive.\nIf you have Lion installed, did you make a bootable USB flash drive using the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0? If not, then does your mac still have its hidden recovery system partition? You can determine this by holding down the option key at startup. If you do, try to see if you can boot to it. Making a USB bootable recover disk assistant will allow you to reload OS X Lion from Apple's web site.\nWithout a working optical drive, you could still install Windows. This would require installing a free copy of VirtualBox on OS X. This option is \"off topic\" and it would be better to ask at the site Ask Different. Actually, the instructions can be found at Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices.\nTo install Ubuntu using a DVD, you would have to repair your optical drive. A factory refurbished Apple SuperDrive 8x DVD Burner Drive can be purchased for $8.75. This would be an upgrade to your existing optical drive.\nIf interested, a service manual can be found at this site.  Here is a link to the actual manual: Mac mini (Mid 2007) Service Manual.  \n\nA: I had the same issue with my mid-2007 mac mini.  I think the issue is that pre-2008 ones don't support 64-bit EFI loaders when booting from USB... or something like that.\nI managed to get the bootable USB working using using a custom 32-bit EFI loader someone else made.  I briefly outlined the steps I took here along with the links to all the blogs and threads I derived my methods from.\nBasically, I installed a 32-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 from USB using a custom loader, then went on to install the 64-bit version from a hard drive partition using unetbootin.\n\nA: Okay, here's an answer from 2018, that actually works (I did it on a 2,1 Mac Mini Late 2007). This took me three days of pain and agony and searching to find out how to do it. Hope this helps the three other people doing this within the next ten years.\nOUTCOME\nUbuntu 18.04.3 (64-bit) installed on a Mac Mini 2007 (2,1) (2.0 GHz model).\nPROCEDURE\nHere are the steps I took. Well, the ones that made forward progress, anyway.\n\n*\n\n*Get rEFInd working on your Mac Mini (This might not be strictly necessary, but I used it and it worked and I'm not reinstalling OS X and trying again without it).\n\n\n*Use Rufus to burn the Ubuntu 18.04.3 64-bit ISO (download link) onto a drive, making sure to use the GPT format, not the MBR format, and have the drive formatted to FAT32, not NTFS. I'd assume you could use UUI or Etcher, but I didn't test them.\n\n\n*Download this file and put it in the /EFI/BOOT/ directory on your newly burned flash drive. (This step came after reading this very helpful article on the Ubuntu forums. I modified what it said to do and it worked perfectly, but do go ahead and check it for yourself if what I'm suggesting doesn't work.) The reason we need this file is that the Mac Mini 2,1 is a 64 bit system that won't do 64 bit EFI boots. So, we need this file to let the Mac Mini do a 32 bit EFI boot of the 64 bit Ubuntu ISO.\n\n\n*Go and plug the flash drive into your Mac Mini, and restart it. When the rEFInd screen comes up, select the fallback bootloader (boot manager? I don't remember) on the flash drive you plugged in. It should have a nice orange icon. Then, when the GRUB screen comes up, select \"Install Ubuntu\".\n\n\n*Profit or whatever.\nI didn't come across any of the issues involving GRUB being broken or not installed or anything, so it was just a clean install and use for me.\nA recommendation: As soon as you can, ditch GNOME desktop for Xfce. It allows your new Ubuntu machine to run much faster (i.e. freeze less).\nAlso, it looks like JWongDev made a pretty good adaptation/improvement on my answer,\nYou can also install mbpfan, which will sort of make your fans work on the Mac Mini (I still need to figure out how to get it to run at startup).\n\nA: I can't currently add this as a comment to Spades solution so it's posted as another answer.\nAnyways, I was seeking a pure Ubuntu implementation as I only use Ubuntu.  I started with Spades procedure. Found basically three things of note.\n1) What is important is the GPT partition table for the flash drive. You can change the partition table of a flash drive by using the GParted program.\nYou can install GParted by doing:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nThen you can just use the Startup Disk Creator that comes with Ubuntu instead of some other program.\n2) On the note of using the 32-bit EFI, I added the file into the ISO before creating the start up disk. On Ubuntu, /EFI/boot is read-only once the flash drive is created\n3) I put rEFInd on another flash drive so the Mac Mini had two flash drives inserted to boot into Ubuntu.\nEverything else is basically the same procedure. I've written my steps in more details on my blog here: https://jeffreywong.ca/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-18-04-and-variants-on-a-2007-mac-mini/\nThanks Spades\n\nA: I also Have a 2007 mac mini that I opened to upgrade to 4GB ram and an SSD then tried to install 64bit Ubuntu with no Luck.

I have a tripleboot system having Windows8.1, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.04. When I choose Windows from grub menu, it takes me to Windows bootloader giving choice between Windows 10 and Windows 8.1.

I would like to keep the Windows bootloader option also there in case I need to troubleshoot my Windows installations. The system uses BIOS.\n\nA: If both Windows are in primary partitions, you can repair install to be directly bootable from grub. But not possible if an install is in a logical partition as Windows only boots from primary partitions. Second installs of Windows normally overwrite the boot files in the existing NTFS primary partition with the boot flag. And it adds both installs to its BCD. You may just be able to copy bootmgr & /boot/BCD to second install and edit BCDs in both installs. But best to have repairCD or flash drive for each install and run its repairs. You have to move boot flag first and then repair an install. You may have to specify not to find other installs. Then move boot flag to other install and do same thing.\nBe sure to have good backups first.

These deb files for ubnuntu can be found at ftp://ftp.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, if you are looking to get them from the console. \nIf you are searching through these on your browser, a good resource is http://packages.ubuntu.com/ \nHere is a link to the linux-crashdump package for 14.04: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/linux-crashdump\n\nYou can see here that it depends on grub-pc and kdump-tools (which probably also have dependencies...), and you can download the deb files for both of these here as well. \n", "Q: Does the automatic backup backup itself? In Ubuntu I have noticed that there is an automatic backup feature, and by default it backs up the home folder, but the folder where it backs it up to is also in the home folder, so \n\n\n*\n\n*does it also backup its own back, and might this not cause an\ninfinite loop of backing up the same folder, and then having the new\ncontents in the folder (the backup of itself) and then deciding to\nbackup again?\n\n*Even if there is no loop as such, does it still backup itself?\n\n*And does that not make backups much larger? Should I then add the\nbackup folder to the ignore list, or...?\n\n\nA: Deja Dup (the name of the default backup program in Ubuntu) will ignore its own backup folder, where it keeps the backup files. There should be no looping.\nIt does this automatically, you don't need to add it to your list of folders to ignore during a backup.\n", "Q: How to find file on random partions then mount that partition Im trying to write a batch script that will find a specific file (EX .homemnt) on a random partion then mount that partition to what ever location I want (EX /home).. \nAdded notes: Will be used on multiple PCs with different device partitions  location for specific folder (ex: /home)\nLong story: Im working on a project that envolves LIVECD and I currently mount the home partition as writable but I have to manually find the device partition on each different computer.

I want to change the login prompt in the virtual console. Is that possible and when yes, how?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: The stuff that is shown before login resides in /etc/issue. To change it, you have to edit this file. You can insert the following issue sequences:\n\\b   Insert the baudrate of the current line.\n\\d   Insert the current date.\n\\s   Insert the system name, the name of the operating system.\n\\l   Insert the name of the current tty line.\n\\m   Insert the architecture identifier of the machine, e.g., i686.\n\\n   Insert the nodename of the machine, also known as the hostname.\n\\o   Insert the domainname of the machine.\n\\r   Insert the release number of the kernel, e.g., 2.6.11.12.\n\\t   Insert the current time.\n\\u   Insert the number of current users logged in.\n\\U   Insert the string \"1 user\" or \"<n> users\" where <n> is the\n    number of current users logged in.\n\\v   Insert the version of the OS, e.g., the build-date etc.\n\n(src: http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/postlfs/logon.html)\nThe login prompt (hostname login:) is hardcoded into /bin/login, so to change that, you have to download its source, edit, recompile and replace it. Have fun with that ;)\nWhatever is shown after a successful login is either contained in /etc/motd or written by programs that run at login, such as the mail notification. Sometimes /etc/motd is linked to /var/run/motd, a temp file which is lost after reboot. If this holds on your system, either delete the link and create a \"real\" file:\nrm /etc/motd && touch /etc/motd\n\nand then edit it, or use the file /etc/motd.tail instead, but this will be appended to the MotD, not replace it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 dual boot with preinstalled Windows 8 I wanted to install Ubuntu with my VAIO laptop with preinstalled Windows 8. So I downloaded the ISO image of ubuntu-14.10-desktop-amd64 and extracted to my USB drive with Universal USB installer. I allocated 50gb from my HDD for Ubuntu by partitioning it as a new volume. Then I turned off Secure Boot in my BIOS and changed the mode from UEFI to LEGACY mode. Then I installed Ubuntu in that 50Gb drive successfully and it said INSTALLATION COMPLETED. PLEASE RESTART.\nI restarted my laptop and it said OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND !!! I tried changing Secure Boot, UEFI/LEGACY mode and nothing worked. Only Windows 8 boots up in my laptop. Ubuntu didn't even showed up in my boot menu. What did I do wrong here? IS there any possibility that I will get to use Windows 8 and Ubuntu along side? Please help me\n\nA: Chances are you've got two problems....\nMixed-mode install\nYou wrote:\n\nI turned off Secure Boot in my BIOS and changed the mode from UEFI to LEGACY mode\n\nA lot of pages recommend disabling EFI/UEFI mode and enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support, but it's BAD ADVICE. The problem is that your computer with Windows 8 pre-installed boots Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. Doing as you described means that you probably installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Those two boot modes don't get along very well; switching boot modes requires either changing them in your firmware (as you've done, or maybe via the built-in boot manager, if its user interface supports this) or using a third-party boot manager (AFAIK, my own rEFInd is the only one that supports this) to switch boot modes on the fly. At best, this is awkward. At worst, it's impossible -- some EFIs don't support making such switches manually.\nAt best, you can fix the damage done by using Boot Repair -- but this can work only if you boot it in EFI mode, and even if you boot it in this way, it's not guaranteed to work. It may be just as easy to disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support and re-install Ubuntu.\nNote that Ubuntu should install fine with Secure Boot enabled. Disabling it is required on a small minority of computers or if you're dual- or triple-booting with an OS that doesn't support Secure Boot. It's probably best to at least try installing with Secure Boot enabled and disable it only if you run into problems. Note that if you get as far as a GRUB menu, Secure Boot is not a problem.\nSony VAIO flakiness\nSome EFIs, including those used by Sony, are broken. They forget their boot order or EFI boot manager entries, and instead boot straight to Windows. There are various workarounds to these problems, which have been covered in other questions here and elsewhere, such as the ones noted by oldfred:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to fix dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 on a Sony Vaio?\n\n*Sony VAIO with Insyde H2O EFI bios will not boot into GRUB EFI\nI haven't thoroughly re-read those questions today, but on skimming them, they appear to both assume that Ubuntu was installed in EFI mode, so you'll need to re-install or fix your BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation before proceeding.\nNote, however, the word I used above: broken. Yes, you can work around problems like this. Do you really want to, though? Would you accept a brand-new car that will start only when the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit? Would you accept a hammer that will be damaged by hammering nails made of metal? It's the same thing with an EFI that can't remember its boot settings. Manufacturers won't pay attention to such problems unless their figurative noses are shoved into the figurative messes, and that can only be done by returning defective devices and letting the manufacturers know of the problem. Thus, if your computer is new enough and if this is part of your problem, I strongly recommend that you return it and buy something that actually works.\n", "Q: Running multiple pipelines of gstreamer simultaneously in sync Thanks to help of \"thiagoss\" I made these pipelines below for gstreamer. one is capturing via Webcam and the other from frame grabber.

Bare minimum is a colorimeter but you really want spectrometer. Unfortunately, spectrometers come with high costs (second hand devices cost at least $150) and colorimeters not really suitable for LED backlighting which majority of the LCD displays are using nowadays. The ColorHug2 is claiming to be an exception because it uses much higher quality sensor than typical colorimeters.\nThe best you can do without any extra hardware is to adjust monitor settings according to test images (e.g. http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/) and then adjust gamma ramp by running xgamma -gamma <some number between 0.5 and 2.0> until the gamma test image reads that the actual gamma is 2.2. Figuring out the correct number for the -gamma argument is trial and error. Try 1.0 first and if gamma is below 2.2 according to test image, you have to decrease your current gamma value. (My monitors have always used xgamma gamma between 0.9 and 1.2 but low quality displays can be all over the place. My \"factory calibrated\" monitor requires 0.92.) After that, just pretend that your display is a calibrated sRGB monitor. If you have a laptop where only display adjustment available is the brightness of backlight, there's really not much to do.\nAnd if you're happy with your display currently, do not visit http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/ because the more you understand the flaws in your display the less happy you will be...\n", "Q: Problem with MAC Spoofing I am changing/spoofing my MAC using \nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nBut the problem is When I try to connect the AP it do not allow me.

Packages of this kind contain shared libraries.\n", "Q: How can I access GRUB in Windows 8.1 I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 installed. I installed Ubuntu Gnome 15.04.  I can not access the GRUB to select Ubuntu, the computer just boots straight to windows.\nI have found the following articles, and tried everything described with no success:\nGrub not showing on startup for Windows 8.1 Ubuntu 13.10 Dual boot\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nThis post as well as the Boot-Repair program told me to try these commands from windows.  After running the commands I'm told that they were successful but the computer still boots into windows.\nI have disabled secure boot and fastboot.\nGoogle gave me these instructions:\nTo access the Boot Menu:\nOpen the Charm Bar by pressing Windows Key-C.\nClick on Settings.\nClick on Change PC Settings.\nClick on General.\nScroll to the bottom and click on Advanced Startup -> Restart Now.\nClick on Use A Device.\nClick on Boot Menu.\nAlthough after clicking Use a Device \"Boot Menu\" is not an option, only my drives.\nI can't find the link at the moment, but I was also told to restart into the UEFI menu and change the priority of Boot Options, although, as I expected, only drives are listed under boot options, not partitions or OS Installations.\nDoes anyone know what I need to do in Windows 8.1 to gain access to my Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: *\n\n*Burn Ubuntu Live USB / DVD (You can do it via Unetbootin).\n\n*Boot the machine in Live Ubuntu environment. \n\n*Open up terminal and type\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair; \\\nsudo apt-get update; \\\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n*Once the boot-repair window pops up , click on recommended repair.\n\n*Reboot.\nThis might do the trick\n\nA: It could be that you have a 32-bit version of windows (and 32 bit EFI system) on 64-bit hardware, this is not uncommon. If this is the case,  then I believe you'll need a 32-bit build of grub not the x64 version that ubuntu installs by default.\nI use rEFInd boot manager and a 32-bit build of grub to dual boot windows 8 32-bit and Xubuntu 14.04 64 bit. Detailed instructions for both are available on the internet. \n", "Q: I don't have ANY packages I'm very very new to Ubuntu and used it for the first time 3 days ago for a project my teacher put me on. He told me to get chrome working on the Lenovo ThinkPads R500's. Turns out, after some searching I've discovered that I have no packages installed. I have no idea where to start with any of these. \nI typed \"dpkg --get-selections\", and every single line has \"Install\" beside it, I'm assuming that means something lol. Every time I attempt to install anything it tells me I have held broken packages.\nI'm not sure what else to say, thanks a lot in advance.\nThis is the output I get when I try to install software center:\nroot@teapot-ThinkPad-R500:~# apt-get install software-center*\nReading package lists...

To install any package, this is the syntax:\nsudo apt-get install <package-name>\n\nSo all you need is the package name. To search among the PPAs on your system, you can use this:\napt-cache search <keyword>\n\nSo with this command you can search for packages. So when you search for chrome by executing the following command, you won't see Google Chrome listed:\nsudo apt-cache search chrome\n\nThis means it is not in the PPAs added to your system. So I add the required PPA:\nwget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add - \nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list'\nsudo apt-get update \n\nAfter executing the above three commands and searching forr chrome again, you will see entries for Chrome. Naturally you'd want to install the stable version:\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\nMethod 2\nOr you could take the GUI approach, by downloading the .deb file and opening it. Then Ubuntu Software Center will open and all you'll need to do is click Install.\n\nA: press CTRL+T\n\nThis will open terminal.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nEnter your account password.\napt-get upgrade\n\nThis will install updates.\napt-get install <the package you need to install>\n\nthis will install your package\n", "Q: pavucontrol is not launching in xubuntu I have the xfce indicator plugin in the system tray.  When I click on speaker icon > sound settings...:\nNothing happens.  This used to work.  pavucontrol is not launching, any suggestions on how to fix?\nUsing Xubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: Pulseaudio is not running :\nType pulseaudio  in a terminal and see if pavucontrol is ok.\n\n\n*\n\n*If yes , the problem is that pulseaudio is not starting automatically when session starts:\nthen  run these 2 command in a terminal :  \nmkdir .pulse\necho autospawn=yes > ~/.pulse/client.conf\nRestart session and test.\n\n*If no, something prevents pulseaudio to start:\nCopy and run this command in a terminal to reset pulseaudio config:\nrm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*; ~/.config/pulse\nand reopen session. \nTest also this to reinstall pulseaudio :\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall pulseaudio \nIf not ok,  likely a program is using soundcard : run this command to display this program: \nsudo fuser -v /dev/snd/* .\nIf you see \"sound-dispatcher', remove it running \nsudo update-rc.d -f speech-dispatcher remove\n\nA: This almost surely happens because the user's session is not Xubuntu.  To find out what your desktop session is, type in a terminal:\n$ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION\n\nIf the terminal does not reply with xubuntu (or ubuntustudio, for that matter) then pavucontrol will never launch when the user clicks on the Sound settings option in the sound indicator.  This is because of the following line of code in service.vala:207 (function activate_desktop_settings), part of the indicator-sound deb package:\n    var env = Environment.get_variable (\"DESKTOP_SESSION\");\n    string cmd;\n    if (env == \"xubuntu\" || env == \"ubuntustudio\")\n\nThus to solve this, you must ensure you log in to Xubuntu desktop on the lightdm screen.\nTo solve this, there are two aspects to consider.  First you should ensure that lightdm's default session is set to xubuntu.  To do this, edit the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf with root privileges and assign the value xubuntu to the key user-session (if it isn't already so), as follows:\nuser-session=xubuntu\n\nHowever, you most likely got into this snag because you previously logged in to a desktop session other than xubuntu. To fix this you will need to select the appropriate option from the list of sessions available on the lightdm login screen.  Log out (or start your computer) and click on the fourth icon from the right in the top panel.  Then select \"Xubuntu session\" from the menu.\n", "Q: Installing Epson print driver gives 404 on Ubuntu.com I am installing the generic Epson print driver from Epson here http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/?OSC=LX.

Only a 32-bit OS can be installed.\nUbuntu is shipped with pae-enabled kernels. Up to 64 GB of RAM can be used.\nBut not more than 4 GB per process.\n\nA: Run the following command to see if your CPU can work in 64-bit mode:\n\nlscpu | grep \"CPU op\"\n\nif you see 32-bit, 64-bit in the output, it means you will be able to 'install' 64-bit Ubuntu. Now, this might not leverage all the goodness of a 'pure' 64-bit machine, but this is an option for you if your CPU supports this. I have a 32-bit laptop and in the past I've done this and I did not experienced any major problems. But sometimes if you try to install some programs/packages you might face a platform incompatibility.\n\nA: Summary:\n\n*\n\n*If your CPU is an old 32bit processor, you have to install a 32bit system.\nIt may be capable of PAE, then it's no problem to use the full amount of the available 4GiB RAM.\n\n*If you have a 64bit CPU, you can decide which OS architecture you want to use. both 32bit and 64bit will work.\nDepending on your RAM configuration, you get the best performance on systems with few RAM ( < 4GiB) with a 32bit OS and on systems with much RAM ( > 4GiB) with a 64bit OS. Around 4GiB of RAM, you have to decide...\n\n\nDetailed explanation:\nAbout the CPU architecture:\nThe physical architecture of your processor (CPU) tells you which operating system (OS) architecture you are able to install:\n\n*\n\n*32bit CPU: Install only 32bit OS or older\n(8bit and 16bit do not really exist any more today, except on some microcontrollers)\n\n*64bit CPU: Install 64bit OS or 32bit OS or older\n\nAbout the RAM size:\nA plain old 32bit CPU can physically address 2³² byte of memory, which is exactly 4GiB (with 1GiB = 1024MiB, 1MiB = 1024KiB, 1KiB = 1024Byte).\nA new 64bit CPU can in contrast physically address 2⁶⁴ byte of memory, which are 16EiB (\"Exbibyte\" or sometimes \"Exabyte\", which is a number with 20 digits in bytes).\nYou have to know that \"memory\" not only is RAM, but includes every memory available to the machine. This includes RAM (main memory), VRAM (video card's memory) and all other internal memories, but no disks or external devices. Especially the video memory is important: If you have a graphics card with 1GiB VRAM, you can only address 3 more GiB RAM on an old 32bit system.\nHowever, we were able to use more than 4GiB even before we had 64bit CPUs. How? The answer is PAE (Physical Address Extension). This technique allows to use more physical memory with 32bit CPUs through special tables that mapped to the memory cells. It's first use was in the Intel Pentium Pro CPU from 1995, so most semi-modern 32-bit CPUs support it. On most current OS, it allows addressing up to 64GiB of memory.\nWhy the 4GB \"limit\" is also important for the 32/64bit decision is the following: 64bit systems use 64bit wide addresses and 64bit wide memory blocks to store data. This however doubles the amount of memory needed for normal applications for which 32bit variables were enough. So if you have less than 4GiB RAM on a 64bit capable system, this effect will dominate and your system is probably less well performing as if you would have installed a 32bit OS due to memory shortage.\n\nA: If you have 4GB of ram then you have 64bit CPU or Physical Address Extensions. 4GB + all of the memory-mapped io, is more than a 32 bit can handle.\nYour choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use 32bit system: Can't use all of ram (approximately 3GB but can vary, it depends on what other hardware the system has). 3GB total mapped memory per process.\n\n*Use 32bit-pae kernel: Can use all of ram (max 64GB, kernel team say performance is degraded above 8GB, due to pae complexities). 3GB total mapped memory per process.\n\n*Use full 64bit system (if you can): can use all of ram. lots of GB total mapped memory per precess.\n\n*Use hybrid 64bit system (install 32bit system, then enable 64 bit kernel): can use all of ram. 4GB total mapped memory per process.\n\n\nAll but full 64bit will use the 32 bit install disk. It is just a case of trying different kernels.  \n\nNote: processes can map memory up to totals listed above. They can map RAM, files, swap, shared libraries, etc.\n", "Q: How to boot from an Ubuntu USB? My laptop is running windows 10, build 9926. I would like to install Ubuntu or Kubuntu over windows 10. I have USB drives formatted and ready with the ISO files of Ubuntu and Kubuntu. (each drive has one ISO). For some reason, my laptop doesn't recognize an available USB to boot the computer from. I don't have a CD to boot from either. I am at a loss, is there a way that I can install Ubuntu without using a CD or a USB?\n\nA: May be your BIOS do not support booting from USB in which case nobody can help you. You will have to use a VD/DVD. Another possible way that uses Unetbootin is described in this post: Install Ubuntu without CD and USB , how? Check it out.\n\nA: You can't install it with just the ISO file. Use Unetbootin (downloadable tool, not command) to install Ubuntu on the USB, then reboot into said USB. Select the option to install Ubuntu. \nAt this point, install it normally like you would for a dual boot by allocating some of your disk space to the Ubuntu partition. Pay attention to the amounts; you'll use them later. Then boot into the live USB again and select \"Try Ubuntu\" to boot into a live session. \nNow that you are in the live session, open the application GParted. It is a partition manager. From this partition manager, you will see several partitions. You can tell which they are by the amounts of disk space they take up. Identify the one that has your Windows system on it (usually /dev/sda1), unlock it (if necessary), and delete/format it. It should now be labeled as empty space. Then, unlock your Ubuntu partition and resize it so it fills your whole disk. Then wait for GParted to finish working, relock your partition, and reboot into your regular system. \nYou should now have only Ubuntu installed, with your whole disk available to it. \n", "Q: Specifying JDK in eclipse.ini not being used I've got multiple JDKs on my system (14.04 LTS), JDK 6, 7, 8 - all Oracle. The JDK 8 is the one picked for update-alternatives.\nHowever, the Java project I'm working on requires JDK 7. I've got a separate directory in my home directory with JDK 7 in it. In eclipse.ini I've put in the -vm option specifying the JDK directory in my home. But when Eclipse comes up and I go to check which JDK is in use, it shows /usr/bin/java which resolves to JDK 8.\nI've got JAVA_HOME set to a JDK 8 installation, also in my home directory, but that isn't the one shown in the Eclipse configuration. So the environment variable is not how it is selecting the JDK.\nCan an expert here explain how Eclipse's configuration is being set?\nThanks.\nLes\n\nA: To specify the JDK in the 'eclipse.ini' you must specify the '-vm' and the path to the JDK on separate lines\n-vm\n/path/to/java\n\nThis entry must also be before any '-vmargs' line.\nNote: This entry sets the JVM/JDK that eclipse itself uses. You can specify different JDKs for each project by adding the JDKs in the Preferences in the 'Java > Installed JREs' list.\n", "Q: Sudden problem when turning on the computer I installed Ubuntu yesterday, everything was working perfect.\nI turned on the computer today and there was a problem with the /(whatever it means).\nThe only thing I can see is the purple screen saying:\n\nSerious problem have been found when trying to check / hard drive,\n  press I to ignore, S no to mount and M for manually fix...\n\nIf I press \"I\" or \"S\" it just goes to a black screen and nothing happens, if I press \"M\" it takes me to a terminal but I don't know what to know.\nI am a bit desperate, since I have to use the computer to make a work presentation urgently.\nWill I have to install it again? It was sudden, nothing was working wrong before turning the PC off.\nThank you in advance. \n\nA: After reading the comments responding to this question, I am also\nof the mind that it is a hardware issue. First, the problem showed\nup so quickly, and the OS is not able to find the root partition\n(/ - equivalent to C:\\ in Windows). There are almost certainly \nHard Disk problems. It may be possible to correct them with the \ninstructions given by the last commenter (Bernard Decock?).\n  If you are in a time crunch with the work presentation there\nmay be a way to deal with that and then spending the time to correct\nthe PC. If the liveUSB will boot and give you access to software\nthat is needed for your work, you might be able to save your work\nto remaining free space on the USB stick. If no space on that stick,\nsee if a 2nd USB stick can be seen and save to that. \n  If this would allow you to focus on the presentation and get it done,\ngreat. Do your work and then fix the PC.   Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Cron execution question Suppose I set up a cron job with anacron, or with crontab -e.\nNow, what if my machine is switched off at the moment cron should have executed the scheduled job?\nWould the job be executed as soon my machine is turned on?\nOr would it not be executed at all?\n\nA: cron will never ever start a job when the system is off when the time for the cron job passed. Jobs can be executed in minutes.\nanacron does start a job when a system was turned off. But anacron can only be set to days. Nothing smaller.\nanacron is used for desktops so Ubuntu has this active (desktops are expected to be turned off reguraly). cron is mainly used for servers (those machines tend to be on permanently).\n\nA: If you are using cron, then the job will Not be executed if the computer is off at that time.\nIf you are using anacron for that job, it will be executed once the computer is turned On next time. The time of execution needs some explnation. Note that the smallest unit of time from anacron is day, so you can only set an anacron job that will have a frequency to run of 1 day or more.\nHere is a sample entry of /etc/anacrontab:\n1       5       cron.daily      run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The initial 1 indicates that this job will run each day (frequency=1 day)\n\n*5 indicates that there will be 5 minutes delay after the start of the computer before running this job\n\n*cron.daily is the job identifier for anacron, it is used to identify specific jobs in the spool directory /var/spool/anacron/\n\n*run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily is the command to be executed.\nSo, if your computer was turned off at the time of running the job, anacron will check the timestamp of last run from /var/spool/anacron/cron.daily. If it was executed the previous day or earlier then anacron will run the job and update the timestamp accordingly.\nUbuntu uses anacron for daily, weekly and monthly jobs. From /etc/crontab:\n05 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nAs you can see everyday at 6:05 AM, the daily jobs will be run from /etc/cron.daily. If anacron exists, it will parse /etc/anacrontab (and run run-parts to execute the files under /etc/cron.daily), otherwise cron will use run-parts to directly execute all files under /etc/cron.daily.\nIf the computer is Off at that time, anacron will run the job after turning it On next time as per instructions from the /etc/anacrontab file.\n\nA: crontab as any other whatever scheduler or whatever can't work when the computer is off.\n\ncron is a unix, utility that allows tasks to be automatically run in\n  the background at regular intervals by the cron daemon. These tasks\n  are often termed as cron jobs in unix .  Crontab (CRON Table) is a\n  file which contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and at\n  specified times.\n\nSo run cron run the command\n crontab -e\n\nwill open the cron file in your default editor.\nAdd the entry of your scheduled command \n*     *     *   *    *        command to be executed\n-     -     -   -    -\n|     |     |   |    |\n|     |     |   |    +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)\n|     |     |   +------- month (1 - 12)\n|     |     +--------- day of        month (1 - 31)\n|     +----------- hour (0 - 23)\n+------------- min (0 - 59)\n\nSo now for your question, suppose I  have this cron entry:\n30 23 31 5 * apt-get install foo\n\nThis I want to install the foo package in 31-5-2015 at 23:30 \nSo what happen if the computer was off at this time\nin simple words, the cron is not executed and will never be executed at all\nNow suppose I  have this cron entry:\n30 23 * 5 * apt-get install foo\n\nThis I want to install the foo package in any day of month 5-2015 at 23:30 \nSo what happen if the computer was off at this time\nin simple words, the cron is not executed, but you still have some opportunity  to run in any day of Month 5 this year at the time 23:30.\nAs a conclusion\nThe cron will not just return to complete if the PC was off by the time it had to be run, instead it will execute at the specific time in your crontab entries.\n", "Q: How to start multi-threading multiple processes with one command I often multi-thread processes from Terminal by running something like:\nsudo etherape &\n\nBut I have noticed that I am unable to start multi-threading two processes at the same time by doing something like:\nsudo etherape & && sudo wireshark &\n\nAnd I get this error:\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `&&'\n\nSo if this can be done, how can it be done?\n\nA: Please try sudo etherape & sudo wireshark\nI hope this answer help you.\n", "Q: Android Studio AVD's Not launching HELP I'm doing a school project using Android Studio and I can't seem to get my AVD to launch.

Try again with a full path like /home/pf/scripts/usr/bin/megasync. Replace pf with your actual username.

For more on the differences between which and whereis see: https://superuser.com/questions/40301/which-whereis-differences. If it's a timing play as Jacob Vlijm indicates in the comments you could call it with a homemade script that includes the necessary sleep time.

At least this was the problem for me and this action solved it.\n\nA: In my case, the error started to appear after doing apt upgrade.

You can also follow the discussion there as they will post the fix when it is done. \n\nA: Well it appears a single application is causing this problem from lack of dependencies and/or broken packages. This can happen from time to time.\nAs a possible fix you can try copying and executing the script below to see if it re-mediates your problem. Since the script does not pass control back to the command-line-interface, as running individual commands does, the package manager should build and fix the dependencies as the script is executed with out having broken packages.\n#! /bin/bash\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get -f install -y\n\nsudo updatedb\n\nsudo apt-get -f upgrade -y\n\nsudo apt-get -f install -y \n\nsudo updatedb\n\nexit\n\nCopy the script into gedit and save it. Then from command line, change the mode of access to executable and execute the script using the sudo command:\n:~$ chmod +x scriptname.sh\n\n:~$ sudo ./scriptname.sh\n\nIf this does not re-mediate your problem, purge sage and it will remove all your dependencies for the application. Then reinstall sage.\n:~$ sudo apt-get purge sage\n\n:~$ sudo apt-get autoremove -y\n\n:~$ sudo apt-get install sage\n\nNOTICE: I did not put the -y flag on the apt-get purge sequence because sage could be linked to ubuntu-desktop package which inturn will take your whole desktop environment. To avoid this you will be prompted with a (Yes/No) option. If you see *XUbuntu-desktop as one of the packages to be removed then enter no as the option.\nIf this not successful re-post and the Ubuntu Universe will help you with another work around!\nGood Luck and Go Ubuntu!\n", "Q: How can I read printer's data from a COM port?

I've seen and followed at least 8 guides to getting Nvidia's proprietary drivers working with ubuntu.\nHere are a list of answers and guides that I have tried (about twice each) that do not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Correct nvidia+intel graphics setup in 14.04 That fixed the GLX error, but I'm clearly watching movies on my CPU. The CPU monitor goes through the roof and the video takes a while to skip around. Also, \"glxspheres not found\" is what I get when I try the \"glxspheres\" command. So I guess it \"fixes the error\" in the sense that it disables the graphics card and leaves a bunch of software that appear to \"cancel each other out\" on your system.\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia This leads to the screen randomly freezing. Oddly enough, I appear to never \"loose control\" of the keyboard and mouse. It's just that the screen randomly decides to stop updating.

No matter how many times I run nvidia-xconfig and/or reboot, this problem persists.\n\n*http://www.binarytides.com/install-nvidia-drivers-ubuntu-14-04/ Be warned abou the xorg-edgers ppa. It has proved to have the same effect as the \"add restricted drivers\" approach on the official guide in that it just leads to the screen randomly not updating. However it leaves your system a mess when you try to get rid of the drivers it installs. A lot of stuff gets upgraded when adding the xorg-edgers repository and it becomes a nightmare to bring your system back.\n\n*Install Nvidia driver instead nouveau As nearest I can tell the blacklist step does exactly nothing, other than create a new text file in an obscure directory so you can check it off your list of things to try.\n\n*How to install NVIDIA.run? I've tried the \"use the run file from nvidia's official website\" several times over the course of a year now. As of 6 months ago, it used to produce that annoying screen freezing problem.

I am admittedly frustrated by all of these lengthy proposed fixes that never solve the problem.\nI am currently typing this question on an ASUS laptop that, according to the sticker under my left wrist, says it contains a \"Nvidia Geforce GTX 960M\" graphics card.\nAnother possibility is that I actually had installed the graphics cards at some point, and I misdiagnosed slow rendering for an insufficient graphics card (I sometimes render 3D volumetric data with mayavi) for ill configured graphics drivers. Though I doubt that since I have always confirmed my suspicions when I found the CPU work monitor skyrocketed as I attempted to rotate the 3D image. Also, my nvidia settings manager has never actually confirmed a working graphics card--often complaining about an ill-configured xorg settings (\"We're sorry, the graphics card you are trying to reach is not available, please run nvidia-xconfig and try again\") or failing to exist entirely (then I install it, and it resumes complaints about incorrect xorg settings).\n\nA: I have just bought a new laptop with a nVidia 960m inside and it is a new hybrid model that also has an Intel graphics processor working side by side.\nI do not know if that is the case for you but I asked a similar question here.\nInstalling nVidia driver on hybrid card\nand the answer I got was to enter the Terminal and enter\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-prime\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nThis installs the latest driver 352.\nRestart and you should be able to have the nVidia X Server Settings in the search bar with all the options etc.\n", "Q: Where is network directory mounted (direct path)?

The Recommended NVIDIA graphics driver from the Ubuntu Software Center is the best driver to install because it is the most stable and reliable driver available from anywhere, and the small incremental performance enhancements that may be possible to achieve from bumping up to the latest graphics driver are not worth the risk of making Ubuntu less stable.\n\nIs the 290 easier to deal with?\n\nIf you want to get a specific answer to this question, you need to provide the full name and model number of the graphics card, because AMD also makes a graphics card called AMD Radeon R9 290 and I need to know the full name and model number of the graphics card to search for the correct driver.

Then take that ip address and add an A record for your domain that points to that ip.\nIf the computer that's hosting the site connects to the internet through a router then you will need to log into the admin gateway for that router by typing your default gateway ip address into the address bar in any browser. \nYour router's ip will usually be 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1.\nOnce you log into the admin portal for router then you will have to forward ports 80 and 443 to the internal ip of the computer that is hosting the site.\nYou can get the internal ip of your computer by typing either ifconfig or ipconfig into your console or command prompt. Your internal ip will usually start with 192.168.###.### or 10.0.###.###.\n", "Q: Having trouble following node.js juju docs I'm trying to follow the docs here and I'm running into an issue with this line:\njuju deploy --config myapp.yaml node-app myapp\n\nI've created a myapp.yaml file and added a github URL to a sample Node.js app but when I try to run the command I get this:\nAdded charm \"cs:precise/node-app-10\" to the environment.\nERROR no settings found for \"myapp\"\n\nThere's no mention of this possibility in the docs and I'm unable to find anyone mentioning something similar.\nI've been able to run other JuJu charms successfully. For instance I've followed the Getting Started docs and everything worked perfectly. \nThanks a ton to anyone who might be able to help.\n\nA: The documentation is sorely lacking and even outright incorrect on this charm.  The trick here is that you're going to be using that last word on the juju deploy line \"myapp\" as the unit name rather than \"node-app\".  The thought would be that you might deploy several different node apps and you need to differentiate them with commands like:  juju status myapp.  Note that we're not using:  juju status node-app.\nThat said, I ran into problems with all this since I'm not running any Precise nodes, just Trusty ones.  So the documentation doesn't mention anything about this and in my case, it just failed since it couldn't find a suitable node.\nYour myapp.yaml then needs to look like this:\nmyapp:\n  app_name: myapp\n  app_url: http://github.com/mmm/myapp.git\n\nYou'd want to replace that git URL with your own.  I found that http worked more consistently than https, btw.\nYou may or may not want to expose your service if you're not using haproxy in conjunction with this.  Note that you might need a config/config.js file in your application which includes variables for mongodb, for example, and which includes the port to use.\nA big warning would be that the config-changed hook seems to NOT be able to pull from the git image.  Translation:  this mighty run the install hook correctly, pull your image and start node BUT if the config-changed hook runs THAT code doesn't seem to be able to pull the git image again for some reason.  It just indicates that it can't find the git image on github.  So at the moment, you might find this useful if your code isn't getting revised too much.\n", "Q: Stop auto-powering-on my USB drive after I power it off My USB 3.0 drives turn on after I turn them off in the Disks utility.\nI've disabled auto-mounting via org.gnome.desktop.media-handling.automount.

The question is, is there a way to retrieve either those drives or the associated data back?\n\nA: The \"drives\" under sda1 are actually the EFI boot files in your EFI boot partition which allows you to boot Windows on your computer in UEFI mode.

I tested out open the help pages in the program while running the program through the quickly run command, and the help pages worked fine.\nHowever, when I made a package for the program using the quickly package command, installed the package, and ran the installed version of the program the help pages would not work properly. Whenever I would open the help pages via the menu option Help > Contents, the following error would pop up in place of the help pages:\n\nDocument Not Found\nThe URI ‘ghelp:jekyll-helper’ does not point to a valid page.\n\nUnfortunately I do not know when the issue began, as I only realized that the issue existed when I ran the installed version of the program, which was a bit of time after I had finished working on the help pages.\nI did some Google searching and found a few similar issues that people had, however none of them had the same exact issue as I had.\nI found this question on Ask Ubuntu that seemed to be related, Problems compiling with Quickly. That person had a similar issue, and they were able to get an error message related to the issue by running quickly package --verbose --extras. So I tried running that command and the package was able to build, however I got several error messages. I put up a copy of the terminal output here: http://pastie.org/10214514.\nThe person who wrote that issue figured out that it was caused by a new line being in the long description on the program. However, I checked my program's information in the DistUtilsExtra.auto.setup section of the setup.py file and there was no newline in the long description. Also their error message was somewhat different from the corresponding one I got. Thus the issue I am having did not likely have the same cause as the other person's issue.\nI also found this somewhat related issue, Quickly gives warnings on packageing, not recognizing setup.py~, however that issue appears to be somewhat different from the issue I have been having. Also that issue was caused by automatic backup files created by Gedit, however I am using Atom to edit the source, which is not making such backup files.\nThe source code of the program is here: https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/jekyll-helper\nHow can this problem be fixed, and what is causing it?\n\nA: After doing some research online, I noticed that help pages for programs are generally located using URIs such as help:ubuntu-help/index. I compared this to the URI my program was calling ghelp:jekyll-helper and noticed that my program for some reason put a \"g\" in front of \"help\".\nI tried running yelp help:jekyll-helper in the terminal and it brought up the correct help files for my program. Thus the help files were being packaged, they just weren't being called properly.\nSo I looked for all instances of \"ghelp\" in my program and found two. One in jekyll_helper_lib/PreferencesDialog.py and another in jekyll_helper_lib/Window.py. I changed the instances of \"ghelp\" in each to \"help\" and re-packaged the program with quickly package --verbose --extras (though I still got a few warning messages). I installed the new package and ran the program and the help pages were then working.\nSo it looks like the call to the help pages for some reason had a \"g\" character in the URI that was looked up, which was preventing it from finding the help pages, whose correct URI did not include a \"g\" at the beginning.\n", "Q: Touchpad only works after hard reset.

I have Windows installed on the other HDD, which I unplugged just to make sure I don't wipe anything (which I did to my Mac when I was installing Ubuntu on it).\nI have looked this up but none of the answers seem to give a clear explanation of what I should do. I've installed Ubuntu before but that was on a Mac, so I'm new to it on Windows.\nThanks\n\nA: Before you do anything else, determine whether your Windows is booting in EFI/UEFI mode or in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode! This information is critically important, since doing a mixed-mode install (Windows one way, Ubuntu the other) will lead to (Yoda voice) pain and suffering.\nYour Windows boot mode is most easily determined by checking the partition table type for the Windows boot disk -- if it's GPT, Windows is booting in EFI mode; if it's MBR, Windows is booting in BIOS mode. A step-by-step in-windows procedure is on my Web page, here.\nOnce you've determined your Windows boot mode, plan to install Ubuntu in the same mode. You do this by controlling the boot mode of your Ubuntu installation medium. In most cases, you can do this by using the firmware's built-in boot manager. Selecting the option for the boot medium that includes the string \"UEFI\" boots in that mode, and selecting the option that lacks that string boots in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Older computers (those from before mid-2011 or thereabouts) are usually BIOS-only and so can boot only in that way. If you have problems booting in one mode or the other, you need to review how you created your boot medium. Many tools, especially older ones, omit the key EFI boot files, rendering the disk unbootable in EFI mode.\nIf you install in EFI mode, the Ubuntu installer will use GPT by default; and if you install in BIOS mode, the Ubuntu installer will use MBR by default. Your situation suggests that you partitioned the disk with GPT beforehand but booted in BIOS mode. Ubuntu can install in that way, but you need a BIOS Boot Partition for GRUB. I don't recall offhand if the Ubuntu installer uses that precise name for it; it might be called a \"BIOS GRUB partition\" or something similar by the installer. By whatever name, it's small (1MiB, typically) and does not carry a filesystem; simply create a small partition and identify it as being for use by GRUB, being a BIOS Boot Partition, or whatever. That said, it's probably better to use MBR for a BIOS-mode boot.\nIf Windows is installed in EFI mode, do not perform a BIOS-mode Ubuntu installation. If Windows is installed in BIOS mode, do not perform an EFI-mode Ubuntu installation. Remember: (Yoda voice) pain and suffering.\nAlso, in EFI mode, disconnecting disks to perform new OS installations is risky. The reason is that EFI relies on both on-disk information and information stored in NVRAM to boot an OS. When you disconnect a disk, many EFIs will erase the critical NVRAM information related to the now-disconnected disk. This is more of a problem when you disconnect a Linux disk than when you disconnect a Windows disk (because many EFIs hard-code the Windows boot loader as a fallback option), but you should keep this in mind in the future.\n\nA: For the next people who wonder about this, you indeed have to match Ubuntu's boot system to your machine (BIOS or UEFI). The way to know is described in the post above. What wasn't so clear in the answer is that when you create the USB medium, you automatically create the 2 ways of booting. You have to choose BIOS or UEFI while booting on the USB, as described here.\n", "Q: Blank screen with blinking cursor after running xdiagnose I have had this problem twice in a row trying to follow these instructions:\nSolution for low screen resolution in Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu \nI have installed Ubuntu 15.04, and had everything running okay since the last time this happened months ago.

I have been trying to get this to work forever and ever and it's just past my ability now. I have read just about everything I can on this...and yet I can't resolve the issue. Here's the short story.  I need to mount remote drives on my local server.  I can make that work with no problem.

Don't forget it as you need to send the system to acer to remove it.  There's other ways in bit you can't clear the password yourself.  I've tried.  Lol\nI don't have the link for the kernel patch handy but the link to it is in the discussion section of the article you read.  It was on Lilliputing I believe.   It's down a bit.  \nHope this helps\n\nA: The latest Linux Mint release works out of the box on the switch SW5-171. \nNo kernel patch needed however there is an issue with the the touchscreen failing to work after a power resume. \nTo fix this explicitly suspend the touchscreen module: \n\necho \"SUSPEND_MODULES=\\\"hid_multitouch\\\"\" > /etc/pm/config.d/modules \n\n\nA: The latest Ubuntu release (18.04) works out of the box on the switch SW5-171. Everything works: touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, wifi, bluetooth, suspend, speakers, headphones, SD card, both USB ports, HDMI output.\nSecure boot needs to be disabled with a supervisor password, as mentioned in other answers as well. There was no need to re-enable secure boot to make grub work (as mentioned on other sites), I could just make the HDD (initially it even labeled it as Linux, I think) the first boot device to boot grub by default.\nMy Switch had Windows 10 pre-installed (it is a refurbished one). I let Windows resize its own partition, leaving 30G unallocated space and then Ubuntu automatically installed itself into the empty space alongside Windows (I used a minimal install, since 30G is apparently not a lot these days).\nOne issue remains: When suspending, the touchscreen stops working. The SUSPEND_MODULES workaround posted by others does not work on Ubuntu 18.04, I suspect since suspend is handled by systemd now. A similar workaround could be made using systemd hook scripts, however it turns out that this bug is fixed in the kernel (first in 4.19-rc4) and will be backported to Ubuntu 18.04 (it is in proposed updates now). There is an Ubuntu bug report about this with more details: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1796580\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 15.04: remote access MySql I install the MySQL from the Ubuntu server CD (15.04). When installation is finished, I found that the configure files under /etc/MySQL/, such as my.cnf and MySQL.cnf are all empty.\nSo I want to access my database from other terminals, I did the following job:\n\n*\n\n*Created a user for host % with all privileges;\n\n*Made firewall utw  allowing MySQL;\n\n*Insert a line in the my.cnf with: bind-address = 0.0.0.0;\n\n*Restarted the MySQL service.\n\nIt has no effect. Remote connections are still denied.\nI checked the variables in MySQL, the bind_address variable shows binding with 127.0.0.1. And the netstat command shows that port 3306 is only bound with 127.0.0.1.\nI don't know why the configure information in my.cnf has no effect?\nThe configuration file shows below:\n[mysqld]\nbind-address = 0.0.0.0\n\nAny one can help me?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 15.04 the MySQL Server configure file is in:\n/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\nYou can find bind-address here. Comment it (by inserting # at the start of it), and restart your MySQL Server using:\nservice mysql restart\n\nThen you can access your MysqlServer from other computer. If you can't, perhaps you need grant some right to the user.\nYou can see MySQL Server bind-address using:\nnetstat -tap | grep mysql\n\nSo you know whether the configuration has taken effect.\n\nA: Line 59 of my.cnf says:\nbind-address        = 127.0.0.1\n\nYou'll probably need to change this instead of inserting a new line at the end of the file.\nThat being said, I recommend, if possible, using SSH with port forwarding to access MySQL remotely instead of opening up your MySQL port to the world.\n", "Q: Why is the content of /run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager changed every time I reboot? I have some issue with my dns configuration, so I googled and picked up a solution by 1) editing /run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager and 2)  running sudo resolvconf -u. \nThis helped a little bit, but the change of dns is not permanent, because I noticed that the dns I added to /run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager always get lost in it after a reboot, and my dns would be reversed as before, which is simply 127.0.0.1, the original one. \nSo why the content of /run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager is changed? Or what's the mechanism behind its change?\n\nA: \nThe /run mountpoint is supposed to be a tmpfs mounted during early\n  boot, available and writable to for all tools at any time during\n  bootup.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nThis means /run is tmpfs which means data on it is not a permanent  storage, it looks like the /tmp, so you can depend on saving any data there since this dir will completely wiped with another data during booting. For that you are loosing your configuration everytime.\nPlease take a look in this Why has /var/run been migrated to /run?\nNow for you, just add nameserver in  the /etc/network/interfaces\ndns-nameservers 127.0.0.1\nread this Adding nameserver in resolv.conf\nElse you can  put it in  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\nread this for more information\n", "Q: Forwarding contact via SMS Ubuntu BQ Aquaris 4.5 I have a new Ubuntu Aquaris 4.5.

I tried everything to fix it. I have bean in every forum on the net for the last couple days, but still nothing. After I login I get a gray screen but don't see the desktop. I even uninstalled XRDP and Xfce4 but still nothing.\nThese are my settings in startwm.sh: \n#!/bin/sh\nif [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then\n . /etc/default/locale\n export LANG LANGUAGE\nfi\n. /etc/X11/Xsession\n. /usr/bin/startxfce4\n\nIt use to work when I only had startxfce4.

Related: https://askubuntu.com/questions/603314/gray-screen-when-i-try-to-remote-desktop-to-ubuntu\n\nA: In general if you have grey screen through xRDP is either you are using an unsupported desktop environment or you have a typo in your ~/.xession or startwm.sh file.\nYou have to configure your linux machine to tell him which desktop environment will be used when connecting through xrdp.  You specify this information by either issuing the following command \n> echo xfce-session > ~/.xsession \nIf you use this approach, and you have multiple users that needs to use the xRDP, each user will need to login locally on the Ubuntu machine and execute this command \nIF you have multiple users that will need to use the XRDP solution, a better option is to let the system automatically create the file. To achieve this,you will add the following line  echo xfce-session ~/.xsession  in the startwm.sh file (after the fi line)\nYour file will look like this :\n\n\nif [ -r /etc/default/locale ];  then \n        . /etc/default/locale\n          export LANG LANGUAGE\n        fi \n\n  #Add this line in the file     \n  echo xfce-session > ~/.xsession\n\n. /etc/X11/Xsession \n\nRestart your system and give it a try and should be good to go...\nNote : You can use mate-desktop as alternate desktop if you do not want to use xfce.\nDetailed description on how to have xrdp working with xfce can be found here\n", "Q: Gnome Metacity, extension how its works?

Why can't I install extensions?\n\nIf you are using GNOME 3.4 or newer and installation still doesn't\n  work, check to make sure that the \"GNOME Shell Integration\" plugin is\n  installed and enabled in your browser preferences. Some browsers have\n  a feature, click-to-play, which make it so the plugin cannot start\n  without user intervention. Make sure that either\n  http://extensions.gnome.org is whitelisted for the click-to-play\n  feature, or click-to-play is turned off entirely. Check your browser's\n  help for more details.\nIf you are behind a proxy, make sure you have configured your proxy in\n  both your browser's configuration dialog as well as GNOME's Network\n  panel under System Settings. GNOME Shell Extensions needs both\n  settings panels configured for the one-click installation to work.\nSome distributions don't quite package GNOME correctly. Make sure that\n  you have the unzip package installed.\nIf you have checked all of these solutions and are still having\n  trouble installing extensions, please file a bug report using the link\n  in the footer of the page, giving your GNOME version, distribution and\n  version, what solutions you have already tried, as well as what the\n  Looking Glass says in both the Extensions and Errors tabs.

Then game ran with lag under setting r_Driver=\"Direct3D9\" and I got following screen.\n\nThen as per the tutorial, I changed r_Driver=\"openGL\" and after that ran the game again. Game ran more faster (less lag) with openGL. However, this time I saw a white screen at startup (when Ubisoft logo plays) and after that I saw following menu screen.\n\nNow the graphics are rendered much better but I cannot view any fonts.\nSo, can anyone please help me solve this problem. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: What you probably need to do is just is try a newer wine version - there is a database of apps that have been tested under wine, and FarCry is rated Gold/Platinum there with most recent versions and OSs.\nUsing PlayOnLinux etc with a particular wine version will often work - but often newer wine versions will work, perhaps better - the info that says 'this is latest version of wine that will work for this' can become out of date with newer releases.\nTo install the latest wine version (currently):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.7\n\nThis is also heavily detailed here.\nN.B. As far as I know, Wine has even and odd releases, even (e.g. 1.4, 1.6) are 'stable', odd (e.g. 1.7) are 'staging'. Staging releases genrally work fine, and may work better with some apps as they are more up to date, unless they suffer from regressions. The wiki says:\n\nYou should avoid using them [development versions of wine] unless the current stable version of Wine does not support or is incompatible with the application you wish to use. \n\nbut that may be out of date anyway... It is recommended by Wine though to test the app in newer versions before reporting any bugs.\n\nA: Some programs using wine for some reason will hide text and other things if they use openGL. (A good example is using RuneScape client with openGL)\nAnother thing is that openGL sometimes won't display correctly with certain video cards, your specific card has good support for Direct3d9 but much less support on openGL.\n", "Q: Wayona mini usb WiFi adapter does not work I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and have found that my usb wifi adapter(wayona mini usb) is not working.

Typical examples of such\n  services are Netflix and Amazon Instant, which both use the\n  proprietary browser plugin Silverlight. These services cannot normally\n  be used on Linux since this plugin is only available for Windows, and\n  the only open source alternative (Moonlight) is lacking support for\n  DRM.\nPipelight helps you access these services by using the original\n  Silverlight plugin directly in your browser, all while giving you a\n  better hardware acceleration and performance than a virtual machine.\n  Besides Silverlight, you can also use a variety of other plugins that\n  are supported by Pipelight. Take a look at the installation page for a\n  complete list.\nPipelight uses a patched wine version to provide a windows environment\n  to the plugins, but you do not need to worry about this as Pipelight\n  will take care of installing, configuring and updating all supported\n  plugins. From the perspective of the browser these plugins will behave\n  just like any other normal Linux plugin after you have enabled them.\n\nJust go to http://pipelight.net/cms/installation.html and follow their instructions (which may vary over time), depending of your Linux distro and the packages (plugins) you want to install.\nNOTE: As of today, latest version (Release v0.2.8) hasn't been updated since 10 Dec 2014, so the project has been quite still since then (2 years).\n", "Q: Shut Down Ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to use Ubuntu 14.04 on Acer (I have recently installed it on Windows 8.1), but  have the problem with shutdown.

It seems that laptop is going to hibernate condition. I have to use the power button to shutdown the laptop. Any suggestion?\n\nA: I am not sure but you could give this a try:\nBoot into Windows 8.1 and disable the fast boot feature which puts Windows into hibernate. This 'may' fix it.\nAlso make sure if your installation is a separate partition (eg: has GRUB bootloader?)  If you installed the software based version of Ubuntu (eg: installed in Windows) then it is just running Windows and emulating it.

You should continue this only if you donot have any data, or you have taken Backups. Also there could be better ways of doing this, and do this only as a last resort. If you do this, you won't be abole to dual boot with newer versions of Windows anymore.\nUpong googling a bit I found that UEFI implemented on Lenovo B757 model laptops are quite buggy. Also it came with Windows 7 pre installed usinh MBR patition table. Since you are not interested in Windows, you must change back to MBR and your problems should be solved.\nI am assuming that you have a live CD/USB from which you installed Ubuntu. Load Ubuntu live environment from the CD. When you have booted into the desktop, press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal. Type in:\nsudo gparted\n\nYou have opened the Partitioning tool. make sure that your HDD is selected in the top right corner(if I remember correctly). If any of the listed partitions are mounted, then unmount them. Select Device->Create Partition Table. Choose ms-dos. Now you need to do the partitioning again from the same tool. \nFinally when you are done, click Apply or the Green Tick Mark. \nExit gparted, install Ubuntu again. You are almost over, but don't forget this last step, or your system won't boot.

I've been inspecting different howto's and guides on how to build packages lately. And there seems to be a lot of ways one could go about it. So I'm a bit confused about what exactly to use. That is I'm trying to see the whole picture. What tools exist? What are the relationships between them? Which are wrappers for which? Which are better suited for what? Like, apt-get source is probably mainly targeting users, not developers. Better alternative must be dget. Which are the alternatives for which? To name a few there are pbuilder, pdebuild, pbuilder-dist, cowbuilder, sbuild, debuild, dpkg-buildpackage, fakeroot. And there must be a lot more I don't even know about. What are the most common workflows?\n\nA: What I managed to find out. First, there is this brief description which is what I mostly ask here.\nAt the core of the build system lies dpkg-buildpackages, which uses fakeroot, which in its turn runs debian/rules (which is a makefile) to bulid a package. And that might be enough if you're going to build a package for internal use for the release you're running it in.\nIf on the other hand you're aiming at contibuting to debian/ubuntu, you're going to use at least debuild, which runs lintian and signs the files.\nIf you want to target different debian/ubuntu releases, you're going to use pbuilder, which among other things builds packages in a clean environment not clobbered with your already installed packages to see the actual dependencies. One might consider using pbuilder-dist to simplify matters even more.\nThere's pdebuild which is said to be \"pbuilder way of doing debuild\". I don't see it running lintian, but that might be not in line with pbuilder way.\nThen there's also cowbuilder, if you want to speed up building packages (wrapper around pbuilder?). There are also tools for building from git repositories, I haven't dug into.\nUPD I'm told on #debian-mentors that \"sbuild behaves the same as the buildd, less surprises\", that \"pbuilder's support for experimental is just wrong\", that \"OTOH sbuild still misses something to take away network from the build process\", and that pbuilder is not maintained. Taking away network is needed since building packages should not rely on it being present, they shouldn't download anything.\nschroot from experimental is supposedly able to isolate (unshare) network.\n\nA: You do not say much about your source environment.\nIf it is open source and just one project (one control file under the debian/ directory) then https://launchpad.net is a really good solution. More or less, you have to get the files right and they take care of the rest.\nGetting the files right is a little bit of magic for me, even now, but there is a plethora of documentation on how to create a package. You could start with a very simple example that works and then take the time to add other options/features as you move forward. That way you do not have to learn all the ins and outs all at once.\n", "Q: Run script when monitor is connected I am trying to run a script located in usr/local/bin/ when I connect an external monitor to my laptop. I have tried to add a new udev rule but that did not work. I created a new file in /etc/udev/rules.d called vga-monitor-connect.rules. The contents of the file were \nSUBSYSTEM==\"drm\", ACTION==\"change\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/panel-fix\"\n\nI took the line from this answer\nAfter searching online I also tried the following rule\nKERNEL==\"card0\", SUBSYSTEM==\"drm\", ENV{DISPLAY}=\":0\", ENV{XAUTHORITY}=\"/home/rumesh/.Xauthority\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/panel-fix\"\n\nHowever this didn't work either.\nI have run the script manually and I can confirm that it works so it is not a problem with my script.\nI also want to make it clear that I do not know much about udev so the rule I have used may be wrong. If anyone knows the proper rule for my problem please leave an answer.\nMy graphics card is an Intel GM965 integrated chipset\n\nA: An alternative way to run a command if a screen is connected or disconnected\nAn alternative solution would be to run a tiny background script. Running the script below in the background, I could not measure any increase in processor load whatsoever.\nIt is an easy an convenient way to run a script, or any other command, whenever a second screen is connected or disconnected.\nThe example script\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply checks every five seconds how many times the string \" connected \" occurs in the output of the command xrandr (mind the space after \"connected\" to prevent false matches with \"disconnected\"). Each occurrence represents a connected screen.\n\n*If the number of occurrences changes, either a screen was connected or disconnected. The change is \"noticed\" by the script and can be connected to a command, you can set in the head section of the script.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--- set both commands (connect / disconnect) below\nconnect_command = \"gedit\"\ndisconnect_command = \"\"\n#---\n\ndef get(cmd): return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n# - to count the occurrenc of \" connected \"\ndef count_screens(xr): return xr.count(\" connected \")\n# - to run the connect / disconnect command(s)\ndef run_command(cmd): subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\n# first count\nxr1 = None\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    # second count\n    xr2 = count_screens(get([\"xrandr\"]))\n    # check if there is a change in the screen state\n    if xr2 != xr1:\n        print(\"change\")\n        if xr2 == 2:\n\n            # command to run if connected (two screens)\n            run_command(connect_command)\n        elif xr2 == 1:\n            # command to run if disconnected (one screen)\n            # uncomment run_command(disconnect_command) to enable, then also comment out pass\n            pass\n            # run_command(disconnect_command)\n    # set the second count as initial state for the next loop\n    xr1 = xr2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as connect_screen.py\n\n*In the head section, set the command to run on connect ( I set \"gedit\" as an example, mind the quotes). Also it is possible to set a command on disconnect, likewise. Else leave disconnect_command = \"\" as it is.\nIf you do use a disconnect- command, also uncomment the line:\nrun_command(disconnect_command)\n\nand comment out the line:\npass\n\nAs indicated in the script\n\n*Test-run the script from a terminal, connect your screen and see if all works fine.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&python3 /path/to/connect_screen.py\"\n\nThe sleep 15 is to make the desktop start up completely before the script starts to run. Just to make sure.\n\nEDIT\nHow to run the script on start up in a \"smart\" way.\nThe break of sleep 15 should work in general, but since the start up time differs per system, It might take some experimenting to find the right break time. With a small addition, the script becomes \"smart\", and waits for the xrandr command to be successful before it starts the actual script. If you use the version below, you only need to add the command:\npython3 /path/to/connect_screen.py\n\nto your Startup Applications. Further usage is exactly the same as the version above.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--- set both commands (connect / disconnect) below\nconnect_command = \"gedit\"\ndisconnect_command = \"\"\n#---\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    try:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xrandr\"])\n    except:\n        pass\n    else:\n        break\n\n\n# function to get the output of xrandr\ndef get(cmd): return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n# - to count the occurrenc of \" connected \"\ndef count_screens(xr): return xr.count(\" connected \")\n# - to run the connect / disconnect command(s)\ndef run_command(cmd): subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\n# first count\nxr1 = None\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    # second count\n    xr2 = count_screens(get([\"xrandr\"]))\n    # check if there is a change in the screen state\n    if xr2 != xr1:\n        if xr2 == 2:\n            # command to run if connected (two screens)\n            run_command(connect_command)\n        elif xr2 == 1:\n            # command to run if disconnected (one screen)\n            # uncomment run_command(disconnect_command) to enable, then also comment out pass\n            pass\n            # run_command(disconnect_command)\n    # set the second count as initial state for the next loop\n    xr1 = xr2\n\n\nA: This can be achieved from following bash script as well.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nxrandr=$(xrandr)\n\ncon_monitors=$(echo $xrandr | grep -c \" connected \")\n\n    if [[ $con_monitors -gt 1 ]]; then\n        # All the layouts are saved in \"screenlayout\" folder.\n        # eg cmd. xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 2560x1440 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output DP-1 --off --output eDP-1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --pos 283x1440 --rotate normal --output DP-2 --off\n        for layout in ~/.screenlayout/*.sh; do\n            ./layout\n        done\n    fi\n\n", "Q: How do I resize root partition I need to resize root as there is not enough space left in the partition.

You probably want to increase size of your / partition.\nYou will have to boot from liveCD to resize these partitions.\nIt must be safe, because you have a separate /boot partition, otherwise /etc/fstab may need to be updated with new UUID and/or grub reinstalled.\nIn your case you need to shrink your /home, which is /dev/sdb7, then move your swap partition right, then extend your / (/dev/sdb5) right.\nYou can do it with a mouse.

Is there a problem with my VGA card?\n\nA: Open Additional Driver , then try to use X.org X server. Or if you already use that you can switch to a new driver corresponding to installed VGA card. Most of the times X server works but I don't guarantee about other drivers to respond properly.\nThen, in Displays check that both displays are ON.\n\nA: i think you need to install drivers for AMD ATI Radeon. Search AMD ATI Radeon and install the driver from their website. Your computer came with preinstalled Windows and Graphics card driver.

Just installed Ubuntu on a separate drive (not partitioned with any other OS), as well as rEFInd, on my Mac Pro. I managed to get it all to start up properly and can boot to any of the locations from rEFInd without trouble. The problem is, I have 3 extra items loading on the boot manager that I kind of want to get rid of. I have been searching for answers and still nothing seems to work. Aside from my OS X, Windows 7, and Ubuntu Grubx64 (whatever that means), I have the following items:\nboot\\vmlinuz-3.11.0-18-generic.efi.signed\nboot\\vmlinuz-3.11.0-15-generic.efi.signed\nBoot Legacy OS from whole disk volume  \nI keep seeing people say \"well try this\" and they just give the method without giving the directions for how to actually do it. Can someone just give me a simple set of directions for how to hide these?\n\nA: There are a number of ways to do what you want, but first, understand that you've got three (or maybe four) entries that boot Ubuntu in different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*The grubx64.efi entry launches GRUB, which in turn launches the Linux kernel (and may also offer its own menu for booting other things, depending on how it's configured).\n\n*The boot\\vmlinuz-3.11.0-18-generic.efi.signed entry launches the 3.11.0-18-generic kernel without using GRUB. (It boots via the EFI stub loader, which is built into the kernel itself.)\n\n*The boot\\vmlinuz-3.11.0-15-generic.efi.signed entry launches the 3.11.0-15-generic kernel -- a slightly older kernel than the preceding one.\n\n*The \"Boot Legacy OS...\" option might launch a BIOS-mode version of GRUB -- you don't describe what happens when you select that option, so it's not really clear if it does this or is useful at all.\n\n\nIn any event, the big distinction here is between GRUB and the EFI stub loader. In most cases, both approaches to booting Linux work equally well, but sometimes one works better than the other. Personally, I dislike GRUB; IMHO it's bloated and unnecessarily complex. It's also an extra step in your boot path, given that you probably need rEFInd to manage your triple-boot on a Mac. OTOH, GRUB is the standard way of booting Ubuntu. Note that, although GRUB has just one entry in rEFInd, its own menu (if you set it to appear) will probably enable you to boot either of the two Linux kernels that rEFInd lets you boot directly.\nPersonally, I'd keep all of those three entries (GRUB and the two kernels), at least if they all work. The reason is that they give you multiple options to boot your computer; if one fails, you'll have the others as fallbacks. Note that your kernel selection is likely to increase as you upgrade your system and new kernels are released. You can keep the list to two or three by using sudo apt-get autoremove once the list grows beyond that limit.\nIf you want to remove entries, you have several options, most of which involve editing refind.conf (which is probably in /boot/efi/EFI/refind under Linux):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the filename(s) you want to avoid scanning to dont_scan_files. Note that hiding individual kernels in this way is inefficient, since you'll need to update the list when new kernels are installed. This could be a good way to hide GRUB, though.\n\n*Add the directory/ies where unwanted boot loaders are described to dont_scan_dirs. (For instance, boot to remove the Linux kernels or EFI/ubuntu to remove GRUB.)\n\n*Add the volume names associated with unwanted boot loaders to dont_scan_volumes. Note that this is the only dont_scan_* option that works with BIOS/CSM/legacy boot options; add any subset of the relevant name to block that entry.\n\n*To disable all disk-based BIOS/CSM/legacy boot options, uncomment scanfor and ensure that hdbios is not among the options. This is probably undesirable in your case, though, since you say you're booting Windows 7, and that usually boots in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If you managed to install Windows in EFI mode, though, this might be a good option.\n\n*To remove both the kernel options, and all future kernel options, you can remove the EFI filesystem driver for your Linux filesystem from the drivers (or drivers_x64 or drivers_ia32, depending on your architecture) subdirectory of the EFI/refind directory on your ESP. This will render rEFInd unable to locate the Linux kernels, so those options will disappear. GRUB does not rely on these drivers, so it will continue to work.\n\n*BIOS/CSM/legacy options appear only when rEFInd thinks it's detected boot code on a disk's MBR or in a partition. Given the description of your \"Boot Legacy OS...\" option, rEFInd has probably found boot code in the MBR. (Bugs in some recent versions of rEFInd cause misidentification of the location, though, so if you're not using version 0.8.7, that identification may be incorrect.) Wiping the boot code can therefore remove an entry from rEFInd's menu. This approach is DANGEROUS, though. I recommend trying it only if you already understand how to do it, which is why I am deliberately not providing explicit instructions on doing it -- I could write a whole answer about how to do this task and it would still probably be incomplete.\n\n\nThe refind.conf options are described in more detail in comments within refind.conf and on the rEFInd configuration documentation page.\n\nA: Easy Fix\nIn rEFInd bootloader menu, you can hide the excess entries by selecting the extra entries by arrow keys in keyboard and then pressing the Delete key! A confirmation will pop up...upon selecting yes, the entry gets hidden and your bootloader is good to go!!\nCheers!\n", "Q: I can't connect to my Firefox OS device I've bought a Firefox OS mobile lately and I thought of flashing it with a new version of Gaia.

Also if anyone could tell me how to bless the boot partition, that would be great.\n\nA: You haven't said why you want to install an OS for one computer by using another one. Without that information, I can't evaluate whether your reasons are good. Odds are they aren't, though. EFI (which all Intel-based Macs use) is different enough from BIOS that BIOS tricks people have picked up over the years don't apply, and trying to use those tricks can in fact imperil your ability to boot. The key problem is that EFI-mode booting involves both disk-based information and information stored in the computer's NVRAM. Although installing Ubuntu using your Mac's disk installed in your HP can create perfectly acceptable disk information, it won't touch your Mac's NVRAM, leaving you with an incomplete boot loader installation. Furthermore, if your HP is also (U)EFI-based and you remove its hard disk, its firmware may notice that its own boot entries are missing and delete them. Thus, you risk not only a failed Ubuntu installation on your Mac, but your ability to boot the HP, as well! There are ways around these limitations, but without knowing why you want to do what you suggest, I'm reluctant to write a lengthy response telling you how to do it, particularly when following my instructions might just make matters worse for you.\nMy hunch is that you're trying to work around a problem booting the Ubuntu installer or a post-boot problem that's causing your installation to fail.

I want to split my Ubuntu partition (which contains the root and the home folder) to two separate partitions, so I could only move my root partition to my SSD afterwards.

Create a New Partition\nIf you have enough free space, you can directly use that as a partition by formatting it into an ext4 using gparted. If you do not have free space you should resize your partition (see Shrink a partition without losing data )\n2.

I just bought an Ubuntu running tower at a garage sale, and I thought it would be interesting to learn how it works. Unfortunately the people left an account on the device, but there are no files or anything on the drive. As they enabled automatic login I'm able to acces things like the terminal, but am unable to run anything as I don't know the password. If someone could tell me how to format it and completely start over it would be appreciated\n\nA: To create a clean installation, you will need an USB, Ubuntu or Ubuntu based ISO, and your current PC. This can be also done in windows too.\nLinux Way:\nDownload the I so and go into a partition manager and make sure to format the USB to fat32. This is need to prep our installation media. Next, download the iso from Ubuntu or another based distribution. In Ubuntu there is a startup live CD/USB creator installed by default. Go into that program and locate the iso. Now select your USB and let the program extract the files. Once done; restart and it should automatically boot. If it didn't, on the bios splash screen, it should be f12 to go into other devices and select the USB/CD. You can then follow the setup and choose to wipe the entire drive. \nWindows way:\nEverything is same except you need a program called Linux Live USB creator. Download it and select ISO and USB (make sure its formatted to FAT32) It will do the same thing and just reboot to boot into your Live USB. \nHope this helps and if you have any questions leave a comment below :)\n\nA: My suggestion is, if you want to see how it works, first try:\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the Grub menu.\nSelect the line which starts with ---Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with --- recovery mode.\nPress Return and your machine will begin the boot process.\nYour PC should display a menu with a number of options.\nSelect the option --- Drop to root shell prompt.\nIn the terminal run:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nmount --all\nls /home\n\nYou should then see a list of the users on your Ubuntu installation.\nTo reset the password, run:\npasswd {username}\n\nYou'll then be prompted for a new password.\nWhen you type the password you will get no visual response acknowledging your typing.\nYour password is still being accepted.\nJust type the password and hit Enter when you're done.\nYou'll be prompted to retype the password.\nDo so and hit Enter again.\nType exit to return to the recovery menu.\nAfter you get back to the recovery menu, select resume normal boot, and use Ubuntu as you normally would, and you could see how it works, only this time you actually know the password.\nSource\n", "Q: Why is my Crucial M550 or MX100 drive so slow in Ubuntu? Recently I replaced the Samsung SSD (Dell OEM) in my notebook with a Crucial M550. Now I see very very poor write performance. Maximum of 80 MB/s sequential writes and the system freezes up for minutes when transferring large files. My notebook is the Dell Latitude E7240.\nAlso with a Crucial MX100 drive in another Dell notebook (E6230) I have the same issue.\nIt's really just raw write performance that's below anything seen in reviews/benchmarks online.\nWhen I put the SSD in my desktop it's performing much better! Can I fix this somehow?\n\nA: It took me quite a while to get this sorted, because it's two factors coming into play here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell sends a full powersaving command during boot (BIOS POST) to the drive if you boot it on battery power. No matter if you later plug back in the AC, power savings will still be turned on. We can work around this with a custom boot command.\n\n*Crucial messed up TRIM with NCQ, resulting in data loss. In Linux, NCQ is disabled hardcoded (blacklisted) for these drives. A firmware upgrade and a kernel update is required to fix it.\nWork around the power saving\nWith hdparm you can check whether your drive is indeed affected.\n# sudo hdparm -B /dev/sda\n\n/dev/sda:\n APM_level      = X\n\nWith X = 128, the power savings is active (low performance), with 254 it's turned off (high performance). You can verify with fully shutting down your laptop and turning it on with AC plugged in (before powering on) that it is 254. And when booting without AC plugged in, this is 128.\nTo manually disable power savings again when Ubuntu starts, put this in /etc/rc.local (above the exit 0 line!):\n/sbin/hdparm -B254 /dev/sda\n\nEnable NCQ: firmware update & kernel update\nCrucial really messed it up in the release of the M550/MX100 drives with NCQ and TRIM. If a TRIM command enters the queue with NCQ turned on, data corruption can happen. Windows does not perform TRIM commands together with other I/O operations in the queue, but these are handled separately. Therefore Windows users aren't affected by this terrible data loss effect, but Ubuntu users were.\nLinux kernel developers therefore put all recent Crucial SSDs on the NCQ blacklist. Without NCQ, performance will be much slower.\nThe good news is that a recent firmware update (MU02) by Crucial fixes the issue. The kernel however, only got aware of this change very recently with the blacklist narrowed down to the MU01 firmware (here). This is fixed in Linux 4.0 and has arrived as a backport in Ubuntu 15.04 as a kernel update through the vivid-updates channel.\n", "Q: Parse file for recursive pattern in my dir there are several files with the pattern \nsimulation_y_t\n\nfor all files with this pattern I would need to check whether in the last line of the file the word hgip comesup or not ...the word might not be separated by spaces from the surrounding characters but if it comes up it will come up within the last 20 characters of the line...\nhow would i be able to do that?\n\nA: Using sed:\nfor file in *simulation_y_t*; do sed -n '$ s/.*hgip.\\{0,16\\}$/&/p' \"$file\"; done\n\nIt will check the last line of each file and if hgip comes within the last 20 characters it will print the line.\nHere is the expanded version (printing the file names also):\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *simulation_y_t*; do\n    line=\"$(sed -n '$ s/.*hgip.\\{0,16\\}$/&/p' \"$file\")\"\n    [[ -n $line ]] && echo \"$file: \" \"$line\"\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The starting $ (before the s/// pattern) indicates the last line of the file.\n\n*The pattern hgip.\\{0,16\\}$ ensures that hgip occurs only with the last 20 characters of the line\n\n*line will contain the line with match\n\n*[[ -n $line ]] tests if the length of $line is non-zero, if so then the file and the matched last line will be printed.\n\nThis can also be done using grep with help from tail:\ngrep 'hgip.\\{0,16\\}$' < <(for f in *simulation_y_t*;do tail -1 \"$f\";done)\n\nHere the logic is same as sed's, in addition tail -1 will give us the last lines of the files so that we can run grep over them.\nEDIT :\nIf you want to delete the last line if it matches the conditions, use this:\n!/bin/bash\nfor file in *simulation_y_t*; do\n   [[ -n \"$(sed -n '$ s/.*hgip.\\{0,16\\}$/&/p' \"$file\")\" ]] && sed -i.bak '$d' \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThe original file will be kept with a .bak extension, if you don't want that just use -i instead of -i.bak.\n", "Q: Juju quickstart failed immediately with: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' I can't seem to get juju quickstart to work using the official documentation\nGet:1 http://ppa.launchpad.net/juju/stable/ubuntu/ trusty/main jujubundlelib all 0.1.8-1 [23.2 kB]\nGet:2 http://ppa.launchpad.net/juju/stable/ubuntu/ trusty/main juju-quickstart all 2.1.1+bzr133+ppa36~ubuntu14.04.1 [122 kB]\nFetched 146 kB in 1s (96.8 kB/s)\nSelecting previously unselected package jujubundlelib.\n(Reading database ... 227193 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack .../jujubundlelib_0.1.8-1_all.deb ...\nUnpacking jujubundlelib (0.1.8-1) ...\nSelecting previously unselected package juju-quickstart.\nPreparing to unpack .../juju-quickstart_2.1.1+bzr133+ppa36~ubuntu14.04.1_all.deb ...\nUnpacking juju-quickstart (2.1.1+bzr133+ppa36~ubuntu14.04.1) ...\nSetting up jujubundlelib (0.1.8-1) ...\nSetting up juju-quickstart (2.1.1+bzr133+ppa36~ubuntu14.04.1) ...\nvubuntu:~> sudo service mysql stop\nmysql stop/waiting\nvubuntu:~> juju quickstart\njuju quickstart v2.1.1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/juju-quickstart\", line 34, in <module>\n    manage.run(options)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/quickstart/manage.py\", line 497, in run\n    app.ensure_ssh_keys()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/quickstart/app.py\", line 146, in ensure_ssh_keys\n    ssh.start_agent()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/quickstart/ssh.py\", line 98, in start_agent\n    re.search('SSH_AUTH_SOCK=([^;]+);', output).group(1))\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'\nERROR subprocess encountered error code 1\n\n\nA: They have a bug in their code.

Right now, an error message says \"No Write Access: /usr/share/java/ij.jar\" \nThanks!\n\nA: You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*The quicker option: (not recommended) You can run your program as root using sudo (or gksudo, if it is a GUI application). This grants the program the right to modify whatever file it desires, but may also allow it to edit unintended files. This might be a security risk, especially if it contains a bug that might damage your system.\n\n*The safer option: You modify the access privileges of the single file you want to have updated. That way, your program may run under your normal user account and can not cause more damage than usual. You just have to execute two simple terminal commands:\nFirst, allow all users to modify the file:\nsudo chmod o+w /usr/share/java/ij.jar\n\nThen you start your program and let it do the update. Close it again afterwards. Now remove the write permission for all users on the file again:\nsudo chmod o-w /usr/share/java/ij.jar\n\nThat already was the whole procedure.\n", "Q: Dropbox stuck on Starting I have Dropbox set to start on load.

so it will always log at least info and higher levels. I verified this by checking the source code.]\nTo quiet thermald, use:\n/etc/rsyslog.d/99-thermald.conf\nif $programname == \"thermald\" and ($syslogseverity-text == \"debug\" or $syslogseverity-text == \"info\" or $syslogseverity-text == \"notice\") then stop\n\nThen restart rsyslog:\nservice rsyslog restart\n\nThis will discard all thermald messages at the notice level or lower, while still logging those at the warning level or higher.\nYou can use the same basic template to quiet other programs to your liking. The starting point for documentation on this feature (Expressions):\nhttp://www.rsyslog.com/doc/expression.html\n\nA: I prefer to log the thermald messages in a separate file, so they are not discarded and are not cluttering up syslog. Put the following in a file called /etc/rsyslog.d/10-thermald.conf (as noted above it must be named with a name starting with a number less than 50)\nif $programname == 'thermald' then /var/log/thermald.log\n& stop\n", "Q: How can I obtain up-to-date packages? I'm using Ubuntu 15.04 which I've downloaded and installed recently. How can I get packages for up-to-date versions of software? For example I can only find g++ up to 4.9, or Boost up to 1.55. g++5.1 was released more than a month ago. I have some packages like git which is just 2.1.4 compared to the latest release of 2.4.2.\nI found a few sources discussing \"Software and Updates\" settings. I've enabled updates from all four sources (vivid-security, vivid-proposed, vivid-updates, vivid-backports) but this has not made any difference. I also found some sources about manually editing your sources file in /etc, but I also found this to be ineffective.\nHow can I find some reasonably up-to-date packages for Ubuntu? Or does Ubuntu simply not ship any updated packages from any source and I'll have to manually track down new sources for every individual piece of software that I want to keep updated?\n\nA: As xangua said:\n\nIf you aim to have the latest version of all your programs, maybe Ubuntu > is not the Linux distro for you.\n\nCompile the latest versions themselves or search for a matching PPA.\nI think , adding a PPA is an efficient way. In any case, this is a good compromise.\nEg: GCC 5.x:\n\n\n*\n\n*ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\n\n\n*ppa:nicola-onorata/toolchain\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:nicola-onorata/toolchain\n\nOr Git 2.4.x\n\n\n*\n\n*ppa:git-core/ppa\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:git-core/ppa\n\nAfter adding a PPA, run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nAnd finally a word:\nYou should add (vivid)-proposed only if you know what you're doing. More infos here.\n", "Q: Disable top sites from Ubuntu Touch's default browser Is it possible to disable the top sites in Ubuntu Touch's default browser when opening a new tab?\nSo far the only way I've found is by removing the whole browser history, but that is not a solution because I need the history.\n\nA: You can select individual sites from \"Top Sites\" by touching and dragging to the right - a trashcan icon will appear and allow you to delete selected sites.\nOtherwise I haven't seen the option to change the new tab page.\n", "Q: How can I export all my VPN PPTP connections to known Ubuntu machines? I have a lot of VPN connections and wonder how can I ease the process of exporting or entering them all at once (about 50) to any of my Ubuntu machines. There should be an application for synchronizing your VPN connections, say using Gmail (like an Android app does) or something of that nature.\nIs there a solutions?\n\nA: Archive (a.k.a. \"zip\") those 50 connections from the /etc/PPP/peers with their configurations in a file and unzip them at the other computer also in the /etc/PPP/peers directory.\nThis is how you can achieve what you want.  \n", "Q: Use Tab Key to switch between files / text windows I'm a new Ubuntu user (14.04) and I'm wondering if the Tab key can be used like it is in Windows to move between files or text windows. For example, I have a long list of files I'd like to rename; with windows one can double click (or right-click > Rename), type the new file name, then hit Tab and move down the list to the next file without having to double click again. Or, if I have a large webpage with information boxes to fill out (e.g. address form when ordering online) one can fill out a box then hit Tab to move to the next one without moving the mouse and clicking.\nIs there a way to do this with Ubuntu? It's not a big thing, but it can be a pain in the ass to click each file or box individually.\nThank you!\n\nA: You can use Tab to navigate to boxes while you are in a webpage. I do not think tab will help you in navigating files. For this I suggest  F2 to rename the file, type your desired file name and hit   ▼   twice to save and highlight the next file.\n", "Q: Is there an Ubuntu upnp interface or api for XBMC/KODI? I am in the process of developing a voice controlled home automation system, a big part of which is my media center...currently XBMC running a Rasberry Pi, soon to be Kodi running on a Rasberry Pi 2.  I would like to have full programmatic control allowing the user, via voice, touch, or keyboard commands to start/stop video, TV, audio, etc.  I know, from experience and from a previous question on this board that there is a somewhat limited HTTP interface controllable through a browser.  I would prefer to have the better/complete control like the Yatse, or other android or iphone remotes.\nIs there anything like this available?\n\nA: There used to be a now depricated HTTP GET interface.\nThat said, the way to go now is JSON-RPC: http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API\nIt is usable over various transports: TCP,HTTP,locally via python and websockets. The web interface is just an extra.\nI suppose this will give you more control over kodi than UPnP because it is the proprietary protocol.

It is a very basic question however i cannot find the answer. I wonder the difference between package and software. \nBy giving command, sudo apt-get install filezilla, the package named filezilla and other dependent packages are downloaded. OK. This is package.\nThen, what is software ? All things are packages in ubuntu, right? Or is there any software? If yes, what exactly is a software?\nBu using ubuntu software center, do i install packages or software?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you are familiar with MS-Windows, the usual mean of installing software under that system is the setup.exe. As you've seen, Ubuntu uses packages.\nThe main (HUGE) difference is that packages have what is called dependencies so a system such as APT can go out and download all the necessary dependencies before installing the package you selected. Of course at times all dependencies were already satisfied, so just that one package gets installed.\nA setup.exe and a package is an agglomeration of files within a single binary file. In most cases this is a compressed archive of some sort. Under MS-Windows, they generally use zip. Debian / Ubuntu packages use ar and tar (ar as a wrapper, tar to save all the files of the package.)\nSo... according to the general definition of software, one package can often be viewed as a software (a program). The fact that it needs dependencies that automatically get installed is an artifact. However, some packages are not software per se. That is, a -doc package is probably just HTML or man files. Others just include debug symbols.\nAs a programmer, I would say that the software is the file that gets installed under /usr/bin (or an equivalent). These files are the actual brain of the software, the compiled program that is sent to the CPU in your computer to do stuff.\n\nA: Packages are like boxes that come with all the components needed to \"build\" software. When you install a software with APT, you basically download a DEB (Debian) package from repository and then build the software with the \"parts\" that come with this pack. So yes, you use software in Ubuntu. Ubuntu itself is a software. Packages are only simple ways to compile (build) programs.\nJust to make things clear, a software is a tool that makes the communication between the user and the hardware.\n", "Q: Typing \"k\" closes search Typing \"k\" closes the Ubuntu/Unity search box. This means I can't search for anything containing a \"k\". I can't seem to find any relevant keyboard shortcut that I could've messed up or anyone else who's experienced this problem.

I want to use my old netbook for a Wordpress server (2Gb ram, 1.6GHz CPU), and I want it to be as resource and energy efficient as possible. I have already tried Ubuntu Server, Lubuntu and Ubuntu MATE on it, and they all use around 200mb RAM when idle (while I expected the server to use less).\nAlso, I am kind of new to Linux, so I would like to have the distribution, with which I will have no problem finding help how to use.\nSo here is what I want:\n1) Which one would be best for performance, the Server version, or something with Desktop environment? I want the server to be able to handle hundreds of users to the website.\n2) Does the RAM memory usage when idle determines which distro works best on my system?\nEDIT: Here is a comparison of Ubuntu Server, Ubuntu MATE and Lubuntu, freshly installed and updated on a Virtual Machine.\n\n\nA: first if your top priority is energy efficiency (and not speed) i would take a single-board computer (like Raspberry Pi).\nthe Raspberry Pi is the most popular (but not the most powerful) SBC with maximum power usage around 4 Watts and it's recommended OS is Raspbian, a derivate of Debian (like Ubuntu also is).\nand if you really need it, also a lightweight DE is preinstalled and with raspi-config also noobs can easily switch between booting into it or just the terminal.\n\nthat said i'm not sure if it can handle your requirements!\n\n\n*\n\n*it depends on the services you want to run on it: nginx or apache, plain text or heavy server-sided scripts, etc...\n\n*and also the amount of users will be an important point: are there only about 100 people having access to your server and so just a hand full using it at the same time, or if some ten hundred users accessing your server at the same time i wish you good luck! :-/\n\n*and also the network connection respectively upload speed must not be ignored.\n\n\n\nto make it easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you don't know what you are doing i won't serve a machine to everybody in the www! - it will probably get hacked...\n\n*i would recommend you to chose a trusted hoster and run your services there (so it is also more reliable, more performant and you hardly have to worry about anything)!\n\n*and beside that you can start trial and error with your own machine inside your LAN or maybe VPN.\n\n*for that case i would take Debian or if you like the \"enterprise-way\" CentOS (for compatibility with RHEL). both without a DE as servers are usually run headless...\n\n\nA: The server versions of Linux tend to take up less resources than the Desktop versions.  So, the netbook should be able to handle any of those.  As far as your second question, I would say only if you plan on your system typically being idle.  That said, your 2 GB of RAM should be more than enough for what you're looking for (unless you end up demanding the server much more than it seems like you intend to).\n\nA: If you really want to be able to compare apples to apples, I would set up Wordpress to your specifications and compare performance there. The problem with comparing those three distributions' idle RAM performance as a basic install without Wordpress is that it's just testing how much it uses sitting there.\nMost of the desktop distros' overhead is probably related to the operation of the GUI environment - probably very little that Wordpress relies on is installed by default. On the other hand, Ubuntu server's RAM usage overhead (depending on what choices you made when you installed it) may very well include a lot of things that Wordpress depends upon or utilizes.\nAdditionally, running a GUI on a machine intended to be a server merely consumes resources and adds potential vulnerabilities. Especially since you say you're new to this, and you're self-hosting a public website, I would keep it as secure as possible. Ubuntu Server (or another server-focused distro like Debian or CentOS) would probably be easier to secure.\n", "Q: install php in Linux I am use VM VirtualBox to use Linux system because I wanna to install php on the Linux system I follow all steps to install apache2 , Mysql , php5 ... and then when put localhost in my browser this page what I get lit works \nbut when I try to run any code by php the result does not appear in the browser.

Does this drive still need to be defragged? If so, what programs would you recommend? \nAlso; would it be worth reformatting that drive to a different filesystem?\n\nA: Whether it should be defragmented depends on how often did you read/write from it. \nNot a good idea to defragment NTFS from ubuntu though: not a native file system. So it is a good idea to reformat to, for example, ext4 file-system.\nI can reference you to this answer: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1335537#p1335537\nBut there aftereffects.\n\nA: It is really not good to have a NTFS partition, if you do not have Windows.\nThere is no good way to maintain it.\nThe best way is to backup all data and format it to something well supported by linux (ext4 or xfs). \n\nA: Obviously if you do not plan on ever booting that would-be-NTFS HDD under any Win OS, then backup/reformat it as ext3 o ext4 and restore its contents. That is your best functionality and performance hope for journalling under Linux. \nIf at a later time you discover that you need to access the contents of your ext3 or ext4 fs under Windows, then know that it's possible to r/w on ext3/4 volumes from Windows XP up, with flaws and unpredictable large surges in CPU usage, in my experience. Just use the the windows extension Ext2Fsd at your own risk for your data and with some limitations for ext4 compared to ext3.\nYes, ntfs is foreign to Linux (already pointed out by everybody here), however I don't see why you could not use it if you ever plan to hook that HDD onto a Win OS at one point or another. \n1) To make sure r/w, hard and symbolic links as well as partial journalling are correctly handled by Lx, install ntfs-3g from the Canonical repo, before rebooting and mounting your ntfs volume. It is perfectly safe in my experience. \nYour fstab line for that mount should read something like:\nUUID=____________ /mnt/[volume-name] ntfs-3g rw,user,auto,nofail,umask=0002,uid=1000,locale=en_US.UTF-8,x-gvfs-show,x-gvfs-name=[volume-name] 0 0\n\nchange umask and uid to will.\nOne drawback though: you might run in some difficulties with setting user permissions for anything saved on that volume. NTFS is rather simplistic about user permissions in general.\n2) Defragmenting; Way back in 2011 \"shake\" was rumored to do defrags on NTFS fs mounted on Lx. Not true, apparently as pointed by this AU set of answers: Defragging NTFS Partitions from Linux).\nOther possibilities are either use a Win OS to defrag your volume before mounting it on yr Lx OS (not very satisfactory) or use \"ultradefrag\". Yet another is to go for a TRIM ready SSD for your NTFS file system. In that latter case you will have zero need for defragmentation. Ever.\n", "Q: My video files keep turning into binary files in transfer to my WD external HD I'm trying to transfer my videos to an external hard drive and to drop box. My HD is a Western Digital 3 TB one I use as a cloud drive to stream on the go and to my smart TV.

I am new to Ubuntu 14.04LTS, new to Ubuntu period as well as old (in age appr. 72yo). So have pity on me and tell me how to do it.\nThank you for replying.\nEdit: I downloaded a compressed file. Can't remember what kind. But, after I had \"installed\" it, no icon would come up to launch it. Found out how to get an icon to launch it. Thinking about it it seemed that it executes from the directory I unpacked it to. \nDeleted the directory and looked for configuration files with UMS in the name and deleted them. So it looked like it is gone. Hopefully it did not leave any remnants.\nThank you for the reply.\n\nA: Yes, Universal Media Server is a Java based application that is distributed as a Java executable jar file, among others (folders, configuration). Installing it only means that you have to unzip the downloaded distribution package file in a folder.\nThe distribution includes a UMS.sh file that starts the JVM with the appropriate parameters. This is the way to start and use the Universal Media Server.\nThe java application is using by default as working directory the folder where the downloaded file has been unzipped. So, it's good you deleted that.\nFurthermore, the application creates a configuration folder under ~/.config/UMS. So, you have to delete this also: rm -r ~/.config/UMS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Terminal Command \"cd -\" makes a Loop! Well I am fairly new in Ubuntu world. New to Terminal too.

So far, I have tried to find a network printer by earlier pressing Wifi on rooter and printer, but no connection has been established.\nWhen trying to find a driver through ipp14, cups it asks about printer's make and model, but this model does not show up.\nIn terminal I also haven't gone far, as managed to install 'lsb' package only (command: sudo apt-get install lsb). Installing 'rpm' file downloaded earlier was unsuccessful as the command was not recognised on terminal. Well, terminal is not yet my strong side...\nHow to install the printer in Ubuntu 14.04?\nThanks\n\nA: You need to download the driver from Epson Drivers Site.\nSearch there for your printer (enter \"SX235\"), download deb files according to your architecture (amd64 or i386).\nI recommend first choice \"full feature\" driver.\nCopy them to \"Epson\" folder in your home folder and run in terminal\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Epson/*.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nBut before Ubuntu could download Epson drivers automatically, when you add an Epson printer in System Settings. Did you try that?\nSame way you can install scanner driver. Download iscan and iscan-data packages and install them same way. For current Ubuntu releases you need to download packages with ltdl7 in name.\nAlso iscan-network can be installed for scanning over the net.\nTo setup network plugin you need to add line net <your_printer_ip> to file /etc/epkowa.conf.\n\nA: I think lsb should be there already.\nI managed to get it work just installing drivers: (they gave couple errors though as I am running 16.04 and some newer softwares)\nGo to the manufacturer site and download driver for Linux: \nhttp://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/searchModule\nNext I installed scanner program from Ubuntu´s Applications and last I edited following SANE file through terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/sane.d/epson.conf\n\nAnd I did add there my printers static ip settings (autodiscovery in case that you use DHCP on your router):\nnet 192.168.2.2 # (Check yours from the printer)\nnet autodiscovery\n\nI had also epson2.conf file and you may want to edit that too if not working or just to be sure. Just add the same line(s).\n\"SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) is the linux way of scanning. sane supports a great many scanners, and the community around SANE adds support for more scanners all the time. By and large, most supported scanners are plug and play simple (plug them in and your ready to scan). However, some scanners will require manual installation.\"\n", "Q: 64-bit java not working I feel like this should just naturally work, but for some reason it isn't. I've gone through the following guide\nHow can I install Sun/Oracle's proprietary Java JDK 6/7/8 or JRE?\nAnd it seems that all the help isn't working.\nI'm trying to get oracle's 64-bit java to work.\nI already installed java using the ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nBut then, it downloaded the 32-bit version for some reason:\njava version \"1.8.0_45\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_45-b14)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 25.45-b02, mixed mode)\n$ java -d64\nError: This Java instance does not support a 64-bit JVM.\nPlease install the desired version.\n\nSo I decided to do a manual download.

Thanks in advance.\nEDIT\nTurns out uname is not as accurate as I thought. Turns out I am on a 32-bit machine:\n$dpkg --print-architecture\ni386\n$ file /sbin/init\n/sbin/init: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x07075fcb55b05aeb6286efabba63534fa6ecd213, stripped\n\n\nA: You are running a 32bit system, as the output of your dpkg --print-architecture and file /sbin/init suggests.\nThe other command, uname, is in fact reliable: You are running a 64bit Linux 4.0.4 kernel.\nThe face that Linux 4.0 is not yet shipped with Ubuntu suggests that you manually upgraded to the newest kernel (or somebody else did it for you), in which the wrong architecture was chosen.\nYou may be surprised, but it is indeed possible to use a 64bit kernel with a system that is elsewise 32bit, as long as a minimum of dependencies are also installed in 64bit.\nThe fact that your Java is being installed as 32bit is due to the fact that the package manager, dpkg, sees i386 as the native architecture and hence installes the corresponding package.\n\nYou can, however, force the installation of 64bit Java. The base requirement, a 64bit kernel, is already given. So you only need to tell dpkg to allow 64bit installations:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64\n\nThen you should be able to force a desired foreign architecture on future package installations:\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer:amd64\n\nNow, this may install a hell lot of packages, namely all dependencies for Java and their dependencies recursively, all in 64bit, even if you already have them in a 32bit version.\nSuch a hybrid system can, however, be unstable, so you may want to choose to reinstall the system.\n(There are ways of turning your system into 64bit, but this is higher necromancy most people on here would never even think of, and I will certainly not link anything of this dark magic here.)\n", "Q: Finding all used IP addresses within a LAN without assigning an IP address to your NIC? Is there any way that you can find all the IP addresses within a LAN without assigning a IP address to you NIC?\nI know most of the tools like angryipscanner, arp-scan, nmap and others can mostly identify the hosts within a particular IP range and with your NIC assigned with an IP address.\nWhat if I wanted to find all the addresses within a LAN just by plugging my NIC to a switch and using for example ARP for all the nodes connected to the network to reply an arp request with their IP address and MAC address using only my NICs MAC address.\n\nA: No, that's not possible.  You cannot use the TCP/IP tools without an IP address.  That would be like connecting to a network without a network card.\nWhat would be possible is test MAC address to MAC address communication, but both NICs would have to have similar firmware loaded and knowledge of each other's MAC address to be able to do this (Intel cards used to be able to do this 20 years ago).\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news...\n", "Q: Can't redirect stdout of `alsactl monitor` When I run alsactl monitor, I see output as such when I adjust the volume:\ncard 0, #24 (2,0,0,PCM Playback Volume,0) VALUE\ncard 0, #24 (2,0,0,PCM Playback Volume,0) VALUE\n\nHowever, when I try to redirect this to a file or a process with >, >>, or |, I see no output, and the output is not redirected.\nWhat causes this behavior, and how can I fix it?\n\nFYI, this is for a hack to force a broken left speaker to stay at 0:\nalsactl monitor | \\\nwhile read; do\n    amixer -D pulse sset Master 0,-\ndone\n\nIf someone knows a better way of doing this (e.g. how to lock a control so it can't be changed), that would be great!\n\nA: The problem is that since alsactl doesn't terminate until you forcefully terminate it, the buffered output cannot be written to the file, because this is something done after the command has terminated its execution.\nYou can force the stdout of alsactl to be line-buffered and hence to be redirected immediately after each line of output using stdbuf:\nstdbuf -oL alsactl monitor > outputfile\n\n", "Q: I want to upgrade VirtualBox 4.3.10 to the latest version 4.3.28 so i can install the extention pack to enable USB 2 support Do I need to first remove Vbox 4.3.10 and then purge and then get the latest 4.3.28 deb from Oracle?

I also recommend you take a backup of all your important data in some external hard disk or thumb drive.\nFirst of all you need to download the right .iso file. You say that you are not a \"techno geek\" so I would recommend you to download Ubuntu 14.04. This version will be supported until sometime in April 2019. Th other version is supported for a much shorter period of time. I am assuming that you would prefer not to go though the trouble of updating your laptop too many times.\nYou also need to get the right architecture for your laptop. You are saying that your laptop currently runs 32-bit windows and has 2 GB RAM so I would recommend you to get the 32-bit version of Ubuntu. You can download the 32-bit version of Ubuntu from Ubuntu website. You have to choose the 32-bit version from the drop-down list.\nOnce you have the correct .iso file.

Now switch it on and boot to the USB. \nOnce Ubuntu has booted, you will have two options. \"Try Ubuntu\" and \"Install to Disk\". If you want to try running Ubuntu before installing it, click the \"try Ubuntu\" button. This will allow you to use Ubuntu without making any changes to your Laptop. If you like what you see, you can install Ubuntu. There will be an icon on the desktop for installing Ubuntu. Just double-click the icon to start the installer.\nNow all you have to do is follow the instructions shown in the installer.

I've tried some solution from the internet such as changing the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\ninside /etc/default/grub to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\"\n\nor\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi='!Windows 2012'\"\n\nor\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nand other solution such as adding:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"card0\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\ninto /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf, but no option works.\n\nCurrent condition:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can change brightness via brightness slider in System Settings > Brightness & Lock.\n\n*I've installed bumblebee and nvidia driver (GL552JX has Intel HD and Nvidia GPU).

I am trying to find how can I install the kernel daemon logger on ubuntu trusty (14.04.2). It looks like it does not run on my machine after ps aux |grep klogd .  locate does not find it as well. \n\nA: To install klogd in 14.04, run the following commands:\n\nsudo apt-get install busybox-syslogd\n\n\nA: Actually, I found my own answer: klogd works with syslogd. Ubuntu uses rsyslogd which does not not need the klogd server at all. In fact, rsyslogd reads the /proc/kmsg file itself. So everything works as is with the default configuration from Ubuntu.\nTrying to install the busybox-syslogd on my ubuntu machine broke its configuration: any nic interface was no longer showing up in ifconfig or ip link show, event after full reboots... I suggest to not install this package, unless you know what you're doing. \n", "Q: Question with connecting to Docker container on virtualized Ubuntu server As a web designer I have been using VirtualBox to set up temporary work servers for my projects. Lately I've been  trying to reduce the number of virtual machines on my laptop(due to limitations of SSD capacity) and I thought learning and using Docker may be beneficial in terms of system storage, deployment of finished work, and in futureproofing my skillsets.\nUntil now, I have been using host-only adapter in addition to NAT to connect to APM server in my virtualmachine from my host(which is usualy Windows).\nThe following is /etc/network/interfaces setting I normally use:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n# VBOX Host-only adapter\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n  network    192.168.56.0\n  address    192.168.56.80\n  netmask    255.255.255.0\n\nI am thinking about IP aliasing to assign more IPs to the Host-only adapter(192.168.56.81, 192.168.56.82...) and routing each of them to each of the containers, which will each be running one of my projects. It looks like Docker gets to have its own network interface, docker0, which cannot be accessed from the VirtualBox host machine. From what I can tell, I have a few possible approaches:  \n\n\n*\n\n*route the connection from the host to the host-only adapter to the\ndocker0 interface\n\n*somehow find a way to connect to the docker0 interface from the host\nmachine, or\n\n*somehow find a way to connect the containers to host-only interfaces\n\n\nI want to know which one of these approaches is the most viable way for me to take.\nI am not sure if my question if clear enough. Please let me know if I should be providing more information in order to make this question answerable.\n\nA: In my opinion, for your usage, you shouldn't have to dig in the madness of docker networking.\nI would advice you to use port mapping when you run your container.\nFor example, say you have created an apache image in docker through your Dockerfile. When you want to run this container, use the -p option to map ports :\nsudo docker run -d -p=80:80 -p=443:443 -P apache:latest\n\nBy doing this, the local port 80 will be mapped to the port 80 of this container.\nSo, by accessing http://127.0.0.1 in your browser you will access your container.\nIf the port 80 is already used locally, you can use for example the port 8080 : -p 8080:80 and then access http://127.0.0.1:8080.\nIf you have multiple projects, you can use multiple ports or use virtualhosts inside your apache container and use dns alias in /etc/hosts of the hosts.\n", "Q: Can't add/remove packages, post-install fails Something is wrong with policy kit and preventing packages from starting:\n# apt-get install -f\nReading package lists...

Installed Ubuntu as a first-time user about two months ago. Has been working great until two weeks ago, when updates would no longer install due to not enough room on the boot disk.\nI did the \"sudo apt-get clean\" thing, as well as empty the trash. No dice.\nThen I checked this website and saw comments which said I needed to boot from my live usb, go to \"try ubuntu without installing,\" and then use the program Gparted to increase size of boot partition.\n\nAll went well until Gparted wouldn't let me resize anything. The partitions weren't locked with a key symbol, but the \"resize\" option was always grayed out. The partitions also had grayed-out \"mount\" on the right-click menu. So I assume they were already unmounted?\nI'm running full-Ubuntu (no dual-boot) on a Dell laptop, if that helps.\nThanks.\n\nA: You have an encrypted /dev/sda5 partition. I am not sure it is possible to shrink encrypted partitions in gparted.\nBut HERE IS information on resizing encrypted partitions.\nYou will need to shrink sda5 left, then shrink sda2 left.\nAfter that you will be able to extend your sda1 right.\nYou can just remove old kernels from your /boot partition THIS WAY\nIf you can't install synaptic try command line way\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d'|grep -E \"(image|headers)\" | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\n\nA: By \"boot disk,\" do you mean the main system (root or /) partition or the /boot partition? The former is your encrypted /dev/sda5 partition, but the latter is your unencrypted /dev/sda1 partition. (These identifications are assumptions based on sizes and how things are generally laid out in Ubuntu, but they're probably right.)\nYour /boot partition is 243MiB in size with 69MiB of that space going unused. The /boot directory typically holds GRUB configuration files, Linux kernels, initial RAM disk (initrd) images, and a few other minor odds and ends. Your free 69MiB should be enough to hold a new kernel, but I've seen some other reports recently of people running into \"insufficient disk space\" messages when trying to upgrade with similar amounts of free space, so it could be your culprit. Try sudo apt-get autoremove to remove your old kernels. For future reference, distributions that routinely create separate /boot partitions generally make them on the order of 500MiB in size, so yours is a bit undersized by that standard. It should still be adequate, though, if managed properly.\nYour encrypted (presumably root or /) partition is almost 149GiB in size. That's more than enough for Ubuntu and just about any software you might reasonably install, so if it is the source of the error message, that suggests that user data is to blame. In this context, \"user data\" is pretty broad, and includes not only whatever you've stored yourself but also log files (stored in /var/log), temporary files (in /tmp), and others, depending on how the computer is being used. See here and here for a couple of questions and answers about locating where your disk space is being used. You'll need to boot into your regular installation or mount your encrypted partition in an emergency system to perform these analyses.\n", "Q: USB3 Docking Station for Dell XPS 15 So I've recently started using Ubuntu and I mist say its the first time I've used an open source / Linux destro ever and so far I'm happy and impressed with its offerings.\nNow recently I've been looking to treat myself a little and purchase a new workbook. \nI've decided on the Dell XPS 15: http://www.dell.com/uk/p/xps-15-9530/pd?oc=cnx9525 however I also want to be able to hook the laptop up to a docking station. One situated in my house and one in my office, with which I will use to connect a few monitors to via the docking station.\nThe docking station that I have been looking at is the Dell USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station D3100: http://accessories.euro.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=uk&l=en&s=bsd&cs=ukbsdt1&sku=452-bboo \nNow after having used ubuntu 15.04 for the past few weeks as my daily driver OS I want to know if..\na) The docking station will work with Ubuntu as I can see it requires drivers to be installed and after having a small look online, I cannot really find a definitive answer.\nb) Has any one successfully run a similar set-up with the same / very similar products?\nIf anyone has any knowledge on the matter it would be greatly appreciated.\nKind regards,\nAdam\n\nA: I'm using a XPS 13\" (2015) and the same docking station as you linked to.\nI was mainly interested in a dual monitor solution with the added benefit of more USB ports. What you've probably read on this forum and other places is that USB 3.0 support on Linux is not optimal. I've tested the dock on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10, not 15.04\nTo sum my situation up:\nThe following does work with the docking station:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet\n\n*USB hub\n\n\nThe following does not work\n\n\n*\n\n*Power (The laptop does not charge via the USB 3.0 port)\n\n*Display port (The screens are not extended. I have not tested the HDMI ports)\n\n\nRegarding multiple display: daisy chaining with Display Port (MST) is supposed to work with Ubuntu 14.10/15.04. I upgraded from 14.04 to 14.10 and still only got mirrored screens. I'm trying to update the Kernel to 3.17 as we speak. I'll let you know if I succeed.\nAs you are on 15.04 I'm not sure how much of this applies to your pc.\nHope it helps.   \n\nUpdate\nThe combination of Ubuntu 14.10 and kernel 3.17 made Display port MST work on my machine. Not via the Dock, but directly from the mini display port on the machine. I never succedded in installing the driver mentioned on cweiske's blog but as far as I could make out the needed drivers should be included on 14.10. \nI'm going to leave my set up as it is for now. I've got two external monitors (connected via the laptop's mini DP), USB hub and ethernet via the dock, and have to connect a power supply directly to the laptop.\n\nsolution\nAfter updating the kernel to v. 3.17 I lost WIFI. The final solution to this was updating to 15.04\nSo on 15.04 I'm using Display ports MST to use dual monitors, a separate power supply directly connected to the laptop and the docking station connected via usb 3.0 as usb hub and ethernet. \n\nA: The D3100 is not designed to charge your laptop as far as I am aware.  I believe only the USB-C/Thunderbolt dock does that.\nI do have 2 external displays working via the d3100 on ubuntu 14.04; 1 is 1200p and the other is 1440p running simultaneously with the 4K touch screen.  \nBasically, you need to install the displaylink package (http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu) and be using lightdm/unity (I had no success with GDM/Gnome).  Then, you can see the monitors connected to the dock via the Display settings in ubuntu.  In brief, the displaylink package provides the evdi kernel module alongside a dlm service that monitors the dock for newly connected monitors and transfers the content of the display via the displaylink software layer.

As far as dual-booting goes, it can be done, but it's usually a tricky process and requires specific hardware.\nNote that you'll usually need an \"ISO\" image file to install OSX using either method, rather than a \"DMG\", which is a filetype that is (to my knowledge) only widely used on OSX.

Here's a near duplicate question.\n", "Q: dnsmasq giving out IPs in the static range I have the following in my dnsmasq.conf:\ndhcp-range=set:red,10.1.1.2,10.1.1.69,72h,static\ndhcp-range=set:blue,10.1.1.70,10.1.1.100,72h,static\ndhcp-range=set:white,10.1.1.101,10.1.1.200,12h\ndhcp-range=10.1.1.201,10.1.1.250,12h\n\nI would have thought that the first two ranges would be off limits to anyone not in the hosts file, i.e. reserved for static IP reservations.\nHowever, when I add a random device in the network, it seems to assign an IP in the red range for example, even though there is no static IP reservation for it.  I would have expected an IP to be assigned in the 10.1.1.101 to 10.1.1.250 range.\nDoes this feature work differently than I expect?\n\nA: Old post but I'll give this a go....\nThis is because all ranges have the same subnet .. \nIf eth0 was 10.1.1.1 then it would provide addresses within 10.1.1.2 to 10.1.1.254 that came in through that interface.\nThis is why all new machines get addresses within that lower (red) range.\nBut if you had a second physical interface (eth1/wlan0 on 10.1.2.1) then all requests coming in through that; would be given addresses within the 10.1.2.x range, if configured that way. This is the only way I know of; of separating traffic easily with firewall rules etc.\nBecause all ranges have the same subnet; dnsmasq is just assigning IPs that are within its own listening interfaces network . 10.1.1.x\nIn man dnsmasq about dhcp-ranges\nit states \nIf you have more than one network, you will need to repeat this for each network on which you want to supply DHCP service.. This to me; means another physical interface and naming them by colour is how I distinguish networks, by using different coloured cables. :)\nReading more into the dnsmasq documentation, I think /etc/hosts is used as part of the nameserver and not DHCP assignment as static IP's usually require a machine name or MAC address to function correctly.\n\nA: The post is even older now, but I just ran into this myself...\nIf a beginning and end address is used:\ndhcp-range=set:red,10.1.1.2,10.1.1.69,static\n\nAddresses will be handed out, sometimes even on the wrong subnet.\nInstead, try only a network address and a subnet mask:\ndhcp-range=set:red,10.1.1.0,static,255.255.255.0\n\n\nA: There is no need to explicitly define static ranges in your dnsmasq.conf if they belong to a subnet defined in dhcp-range: simply define static leases using dhcp-host (e.g., dhcp-host=[MAC address],[IP address]. Defining static ranges is only needed if you want to assign static IP addresses in a subnet where you do not also assign dynamic IP addresses.\nFrom the man page:\n\nAddresses allocated like this [i.e., using dhcp-host] are not constrained to be in the range given by the --dhcp-range option, but they must be in the same subnet as some valid dhcp-range. For subnets which don't need a pool of dynamically allocated addresses, use the \"static\" keyword in the --dhcp-range declaration.\n\nSo, to assign 10.1.1.70 as a static IP address to a machine with MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55 with a 72 hour lease and tag it with blue, use:\ndhcp-range=10.1.1.201,10.1.1.250,12h\ndhcp-host=00:11:22:33:44:55,set:blue,10.1.1.70,72h\n\n", "Q: Reading error messages at bootup I'm helping a friend load Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on an old Dell laptop.

There's also a line that says something about getting some updated software.\nHow do I get to these errors and messages, or stop the process so I can at least read them?\n\nA: I believe that viewing the contents of the system log - \nsudo more /var/log/messages\n\nmight just get you what you are after.  \nThere is also the kernel ring buffer, at \n/var/log/dmesg\nwhich can be viewed via paging commands (using less, and more [as in the above example]), or its most recent contents with just \nsudo dmesg\n\n", "Q: Installing a third OS I just installed Ubuntu on my second hard drive.  I am in an Intro to Unix/Linux course and would like to install another version of linux on my second hard drive as well.  Can I just make a partition and install it there?  Will GRUB be updated as to the third OS?\n\nA: This fairly depends on the os your installing , if you go for windows you would need to install grub again . \nMost linux distros will recognise the already installed os and give you an option to install grub again or not to do so . Either way grub will later on scan for available os's .\n\nA: I use a system with Windows 8, Ubuntu, and Elementary OS. It works great.\nMy computer came loaded with Windows 8. After a while, I decided I wanted to put Linux on that machine. After installing Linux once, I decided I wanted to install another distro (Elementary OS). I just shrunk some space on one of my two OS partitions that I currently had, then installed it there. GRUB works well. As long as both of the two OS's you are installing are not Windows, you should be fine. In which case you just re-install GRUB, like so: sudo grub-install /dev/sda and then sudo grub-update. I think :)\nSo yes, you can. In terms of swap, don't worry. You only need one of those.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: As yohan esteves already said this depends on the Linux distro you want to install. Most Linux distributions install their own version GRUB that will include your windows installation and your two other Linux installations. Furthermore most distros have the option not to overwrite the existing bootloader. So you will be fine.\nHowever if you have costumized your old GRUB (e.g. custom colors) and installed a new GRUB via the new Linux installation or if your old GRUB for some reason doesn't update automatically then you can always execute these two commands:\nTo update the grub configuration manually enter this into a terminal in your Ubuntu system:\nsudo update-grub\n\nTo completely reinstall GRUB enter the following:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\n\nWhere sdX is the hard drive you are booting from.\nIf the Linux distribution you want to install on your PC installs GRUB with a bad configuration then you may end up in a state where you cannot boot any OS. (This happened to me with OpenSuse several times).\nIn this case boot the live system from your installation CD and open a terminal and enter the following commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nWhere sdXY is your Ubuntu partition.\nType the command in the next line only if you are using UEFI boot!\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi\n\nNow go on:\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo mount -t proc /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo cp /proc/mounts /mnt/etc/mtab\nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash\n\nNow you can execute commands in your Ubuntu installation:\ngrub-install /dev/sdX\n\nWhere sdX is your boot hard drive.\nupdate-grub\n\nFurthermore there isn't anything you have to consider except that you make sure that you don't overwrite anything when installing a new OS. Just shrink your old Ubuntu partition and create a new one. You have to make sure that the swap of Ubuntu is also mounted in your new OS if you want that. There should be something like 'use as swap' when you change the mount point of the swap partition.\n\nA: How about installing the third and even fourth and fifth in a vm? That way you can install as many as you want and know that it will not affect your main os.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 suddenly won't load the Unity GUI after an update This follows up with a new twist to:\nUbuntu 14.04 stopped booting suddenly\nThe situation before the problem cropped up was a little different this time around (for one, I didn't mess around with LightDM beforehand): Late this afternoon/earlier this evening, I tried to install some updates on my system with the Software Updater.  \nThings seemed to go relatively well in that regard, but I also noticed that I was suddenly unable to open Opera normally as well as Unity failing to return search results for applications.  I then rebooted.  Wanting to check on things, I decided to go into the Recovery Manager.  I then ran fsck followed by the FailSafe Graphics mode.  \nUnfortunately, the computer failed to boot, so after about 2 or 3 minutes, I did a hard shutdown (power button), did another file check, and tried to start it normally.

That didn't work either.\nAs with last time, it does appear I can at least boot up the basic console, but the GUI just won't work. I even tried starting LightDM, which ended with the system telling me that it was already active. \nSo I'm left with an Ubuntu that is virtually totally useless to me, especially because I'm not an expert user.  Further complicating things is the fact that I'm not sure how I finally managed to get the system to work again the last time.\nSo, can anyone offer some help? \n\nA: Okay, well, luckily enough, I was able to fix the problem early on, and I think I may now know what could have caused it, or at least contributed to it: \nI had been running really low on disk space for some time (and sometimes had to save my downloads elsewhere), and when I was finally able to log in as a Guest (startx might have really helped here!) the system informed me that I had literally no disk space left.\nAfter mucking around with Baobab a bit, I decided to go ahead and delete an old game that I was no longer playing, which gave me about 2 GB of free space; I also got rid of Steam as well.\nWell, when I restarted the computer, I was able to boot up Ubuntu normally, without any issues whatsoever.

I want step by step for understand.\nHelp me please.\nps.\nKUbuntu 14.10,\napache2\n\nA: Quoted from http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/urlmapping.html\n\nFiles Outside the DocumentRoot\nThere are frequently circumstances where it is necessary to allow web\naccess to parts of the filesystem that are not strictly underneath the\nDocumentRoot. Apache offers several different ways to accomplish this.\nOn Unix systems, symbolic links can bring other parts of the\nfilesystem under the DocumentRoot. For security reasons, Apache will\nfollow symbolic links only if the Options setting for the relevant\ndirectory includes FollowSymLinks or SymLinksIfOwnerMatch.\nAlternatively, the Alias directive will map any part of the filesystem\ninto the web space. For example, with\nAlias /docs /var/web the URL http://www.example.com/docs/dir/file.html\nwill be served from /var/web/dir/file.html.....\n\nWhat does this mean?\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default\n\nIt will open:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n    <Directory />\n        Options FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride None\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /var/www/>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride None\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\nNow add the alias and the directory permissions , suppose add /pics and I will use the Pictures directory in my home to server it.\noutput would be like:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n    Alias /docs /home/user/Pictures\n    <Directory />\n        Options FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride None\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /var/www/>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride None\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /home/user/Pictures>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride None\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\nNow restart apache service\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nNow when typing localhost/pics this will serve from /home/user/Pictures instead of /var/www\n\n", "Q: Why does the installation of a 32-bit package remove 64-bit packages?

In keybindings the pull down terminal is empty and nothing can be done there. I close tilda and then need to type exit to get rid of the terminal screen.\nQuite annoying, how can I stop this and could anyone please let me know if there is a fix to get rid it.\nThanks\n\nA: I have just had the problem occur in Ubuntu Mate 15.04. This is a simple way I found of fixing it (for new users such as myself).\n\n\n*\n\n*When the Tilda 1 Config window appears, go to the Keybindings tab.\n\n*Click on \"Pull Down Menu\" at the top left of the window. A new dialogue will open with a place to click \"Close\": ignore that.\n\n*Press the key you wish to assign to Tilda's terminal. I used F12 for this. \n\n*Click \"Close\". \n\n\nAs Christian stated, you can also remove it from the Startup, which I have also done. \n\nA: This issue seems to be fixed by now, try compiling the newest version.\nDownload the Source and take a look at the Instructions on this page.\nBut if you dont need or want Tilda, the easiest way to get rid of this error is to can disable it in the Startup Programs. \n", "Q: Chromium app closes after executing the bash script by double click I have a chromium app which i want to execute from a bash script. I am successfully able to execute this command from terminal and able to open the app but when i tried to double click the script the app is exiting as soon as the script is executed.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nnohup /usr/bin/chromium-browser --disable-gpu --enable-offline-auto-reload --enable-offline-auto-reload-visible-only --app=chrome-extension://jbnkffmindojffecdhbbmekbmkkfpmjd/foreground.html & disown &\n\nHow can I open chromium app by double clicking the script?\n\nA: I can't answer your question to fit with your exact code, however I can recommend a few things. \nFirst, make sure to make the script executable by cding to its location and running chmod +x ./scriptname.sh. This will sort of solve your double click issue; you cannot make it executable by a double click but this way you can execute it with Alt-F2. Just put it in your home folder and run ./scriptname.sh. \nAs for why it quits: I'm not totally sure but it seems like you have an overload of commands in there. nohup, disown and & all do different things, as explained here, but you may not want to do all of them and they may be conflicting somehow. I would recommend removing the last & at the very least. \nThe thing is, nohup and disown make your process ignore a SIGHUP, which you may need to use in the event of a hang, especially given it's Chrome. In this case, just run the command without nohup or disown, and just one & at the end. This will keep your process as-is except your terminal window is free to do other actions, including close. \nAnother thing you could try is making this script open its own terminal window. This is written as follows:\ngnome-terminal -e /usr/bin/chromium-browser (et cetera)\n\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: how do I eliminate unused packages in version 15.04 When upgrading to version 15.04 from 14.10 there was a \"clean up\" time period where I received a query to eliminate 18 unused or unnecessary packages.  Can anyone show me where I can make sure that I don't have any superfluous unused packages?\n\nA: First you should know our systems is not that smart !! A system can't know which package is needed by you or not. Ubuntu can't remove any package that were installed by the user himself, instead it offers you to delete the packages that were downloaded as dependencies for other packages and not used anymore, which means those packages were installed by the system itself and not by the user...\nman apt-get\n autoremove\n           autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically\n           installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no\n           longer needed.\n\nSo running sudo apt-get autoremove will uninstall the unused packages which were used as dependencies for other packages.\nA system can show you  the Important or required packages so those is not supposed to be removed.\nInstall aptitude if you don't have it:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nNow you can search for packages considered required:\naptitude search '~prequired'\n\nor important:\naptitude search '~pimportant'\n\nHow To know The unused packages in Ubuntu\nThere is a bash script for a tool called unusedpkg, this can test since when you didn't use the packages so you can determine what to delete.\nDownload the script. Extract the zipped folder then give permission to the script\nchmod +x unusedpkg\n\nNow you can run it from dir containing the script\n$./unusedpkg \n\nSample output:\n* UnusedPkg 0.6\n  Find unused packages in your Linux system.\n\nWARNING:\n   Idle days may be wrong. Before delete anything, check package timestamps\n   using 'unusedpkg info <package>', or manually with 'ls -alu'.

Until a few years back, I had only one desktop, and KeePass seems to take care of my password management very well. Now I use multiple devices. What I did was that I stored all my passwords using KeePass on my Android phone and typed them in. But this method is very bad because I started using the same weak password for all my online accounts. \nToday morning, I thought of fixing this. I uninstalled KeePassDroid and intsalled keepass2andorid on my phone. I set it up to sync passwords to my Google Drive. I installed keeepass2 on my Ubuntu laptop.\nBut I can't seem to set up KPGoogleSync plug in. The error occurs when I try to extract the downloaded plugin archive.

The thing is that some documents appear well but some others not. Instead of normal letters there are strange symbols\n\nA: The only safe methods to read correctly an MS document are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buying Microsoft Office and a OS that support that, and maybe running it in a virtual machine. \n\n*Using Office365 online on your Linux machine (it works, but keep in mind that Word online, for example, can't support the full Word features).\n\n*Asking your peer to send the documents in other formats (ODS, etc.), taking into account that the same limitation of point 2 applies. \n\n*If just for reading, ask your peers to send you PDFs. These are perfectly compatible most of the time (if fonts are embedded). \nSo unfortunately the answer is that there is no LO-MSO guarantee of compatibility at all; what you have in Libre Office is a best-effort thing that works reasonably well sometime, badly some other time. It is getting better and better, but it is a moving target. \n\nA: \nInstead of normal letters there are strange symbols\n\nAs Rmano pointed out, you never can achieve 100% compatibility. However, the problem you describe sounds like being related to different fonts. So one first attempt would be either to agree on using fonts that are available on both platforms or installing the MS fonts on Ubuntu (the latter however, is not legal with the newer MS fonts if you don't have a Windows license). \n\nA: We do not have enough info to answer your question. Are you using Libre office, and what version and on what ubuntu version?\nHowever, as Bruni suggests, install Microsoft core fonts and try opening your documents again. They can be found in the UBUNTU SOFTWARE CENTER [install the Ubuntu restricted extras]. Install that package and come back if you still have any issues.\n", "Q: Bootloader of Ubuntu I bought a HP laptop with windows 7. After I installed Ubuntu 15.04 desktop.

I have seen multiple guides about installing it on 14.04 - 14.10 but none on 15.04. I have already tried installing the debian repositories which I now know breaks your distro. Before posting duplicates please read what version of Ubuntu the PPA was built for eg. Utopic, Raring etc. I need it for Vivid Vervet.\n\nA: katoolin is a script that helps to install Kali Linux tools on your Linux distribution of choice. Those who like to use the penetration testing tools provided by the Kali Linux development team can effectively do that on Ubuntu by using Katoolin. The following instructions are for installing Katoolin on Ubuntu 15.04. These instructions also work on all other currently supported versions of Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install git  \ngit clone https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin.git && sudo cp katoolin/katoolin.py /usr/bin/katoolin  \n\n\n*Make /usr/bin/katoolin executable.\nsudo chmod +x  /usr/bin/katoolin  \n\n\n*Run Katoolin as follows and you will see the Katoolin interface:\ncd /usr/bin/\nsudo ./katoolin    \n\n\nWhen you go to View Categories and then enter 0 for all, the installer will immediately return to where you were. Scroll up, and you may see that a number of the packages can't be found. Those packages are no longer maintained or have been removed from the Kali repositories. If this happens the best option is to install Kali linux tools one tool at a time in a series of distinct steps.\nWarning about updates after installing Kali linux tools\nThe LionSec Katoolin GitHub webpage clearly warns Katoolin users to be careful when updating software.\n\nBefore updating your system, please remove all Kali-linux repositories to avoid any kind of problem.  \n\n\nAll kinds of problems can occur if you don't do this. \n\nA: I doubt you'll find all the Kali tools.  As well, it's not just the tools you need.\nKali is a purpose built distro.  The software in it is selected for the (intended) purposes of ethical hacking and forensics.  The kernel has modifications, the software is based on Debian, and most if not all the packages are actually modified in some way from Debian.\nUltimately, while you will not likely find all the Kali tools, you may find some, such as Metasploit, but you're missing on some purpose-built security-centric changes that Kali does in addition to Debian and Ubuntu (i.e. it stops services loading at boot, and other things).\n\nA: Kali linux does not use PPA's like the other distros this is part of their security. How ever it is possible to add PPA's to kali and Kali PPA's to other distros.\n! ! ! ! ! !  AT YOUR OWN RISK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! \nWAGUNGS archive @ launchpad they are not official please go to kali.org\nPlease get all of the Kali linux PPA's from the tools listing on the Kali site. They have a updated list of tools with links and PPA's for all of the stuff on their distro's. Not that Wagungs tools are not safe but that being open source any one can make changes to it and I will not tell you or any one to get stuff I myself would not. They may be safe but I advise using Kali to go the the official source of all the individual projects for safety of your system. So you know exactly what your getting is the real deal with untampered code.\n! ! ! ! ! !  AT YOUR OWN RISK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\nIf you would like the install kali tools on Ubuntu or other distros you may run in to binary dependency problems. You can find a list of all the kali linux tools on their site here.\nKali Linux Official Sites Tools List \nThey have all of the PPA's and official project links well organized and kept up to date if you wish to install with the PPA's. You can all so read their Documentation on Kali to install their PPA's and tons of other neat stuff. Like most distro PPA databases Kali's is all so kind of hidden so it's easiest to just have a disk to live boot to get all their PPA's or play with their tools.\nI believe that Kali and Ubuntu have multi-arching compatibility issues. I am running on trusty and I have had some binary compatibility issues with installing some of their tools. So you will need binary, source, library, and PPA's that do not conflict from both to have %100 successful blend.\nKali unfortunately is designed not to use PPA's ever except for the install default two or three provided by Kali themselves. This is part of their tight security feature that makes their Distro so secure since it's much harder to be tampered with by viruses and malware and such.\nYou want to make sure that you do not have to many Kali PPA's or to many Ubuntu or Debian or Arch whatever of any kind because mixing PPA's can drag you to your grave. They will essentially start fighting over your system when you sudo apt-get upgrade causing install and removal of various packages, libraries, and etc... This can cause incompatibility issues and conflicts beyond just a simple fix. They can really make things get funky quick.\nIt is ok to do sudo apt-get update with the PPA's but do not upgrade. You will want to comment out the extra PPA's for the tools after updating to you do not screw your system over with upgrade. Most of Kali's tools are going to have to be installed by source code and mixing PPA's and using apt-get upgrade can delete necessary things for Kali tools or Ubuntu to work.\nIt is most import and I have to stress that Debian PPA's (Kali's Deb based) do not really get along with Ubuntu PPA's. Though every one is technically Debian based. They should be thought of more like In laws. There family but not really tolerable but you can get along.\n", "Q: Apache Httpd backed by both Tomcat and PHP After a bit of googling it turned out that this topic is not well described hence asking about it here.\nWhat I have already: well setup & working system where:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache Tomcat with main web-application is running on port 8080 and handling all requests like mycompany.com:8080/*\n\n*Apache HTTPD 2.4.7 running on port 80 with PHP module and handling requests to WordPress-based blog at mycompany.com/blog\nWhat I successfully achieved:\n\n\n*Adding mod_jk connector and having Apache HTTPD routing all requests to Tomcat via 8009 port so that Tomcat is handling all requests like mycompany.com/*\nWhat I would like to achieve:\n\n\n*Apache HTTPD is intercepting all requests at port 80 and if url is /blog* then PHP5 module is intercepting it, otherwise everything else is handled by mod_jk connector i.e.\n/blog* -> PHP5 Apache module -> WordPress blog\n/* -> mod_jk -> Tomcat with web-application\nCould you please advise if it's possible with minimum configuration of existing modules (without using modules like mod_rewrite or any other)?\nCould you please elaborate regarding possible security holes of PHP module with such configuration since I'm not experienced with it?\nThanks a lot in advance for any help!\n\nA: Answered the same question on StackOverflow and got an answer there:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30935328/php-wordpress-blog-and-tomcat-on-same-server-is-it-possible/30938420#30938420\n", "Q: Adblock problem I use adblock plus to remove annoying ads especially on cpasbien.pw (on firefox / ubuntu 12.04, 64 bit.)\nThe problem is when activating it, not only the ads are blocked, but also the download tab is hidden.

Is booting into recovery console to gain root access to \"sudoers\" file the proper way to enable \"sudo\" for myself on a clean Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation? If yes, how do I do it? If no, what is the best way?\n\nA: Most people who install Ubuntu will already have an account, with sudo privileges, set up automatically.  This will be the case if you install from the official desktop installer.  If you install from a text-mode installer such as a server installer, then it's achieved by setting up a user account for yourself, and leaving the root password field blank.  This will make it set your account up with sudo privileges.\nIf you gave a root password during installation and you want to instead use sudo, then there are a few steps:\nGive your account sudo access\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into the root account (eg with su)\n\n*Make sure sudo is installed with apt-get install sudo\n\n*Add your user to sudo with adduser username sudo where \"username\" is the account name to add to sudo.\n\n*Log out fully from your account then log in fresh.\nRemove root password\n\n\n*\n\n*First, make sure you can sudo from your account.\n\n*Then disable logging in as root with sudo passwd -l root\n\nA: If you're using the default user (the one created at installation) then they're already in the sudoers file, and can edit the file by running the command:\nsudo visudo\n\nThis will prompt you for the default user's password, then allow you to edit the file.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install a docker container on a virtual Ubuntu Server?

Hence 8 Megabits (Mb) or 8,000,000 bits, make up 1 Megabyte (MB) or 1000² = 1,000,000 bytes.\nTo make things more complicated, GSM would display transfer speed in Mebibyte (MiB), which contains 1,024² = 1,048,576 bytes. Even worse, these online speed tests aren't always clear, whether they consider 1 Megabit to be 1000² or 1024² bits.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 virtualbox ctrl and alt keys on a MacBook Pro keyboard?

But after subsequent Ubuntu re-installations/upgrades, I forgot about this, and now seeing your question, I've reimplemented it. This is how I did this:\nFirstly, install the necessary packages:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xbindkeys-config xvkbd\n\nHere, basically xbindkeys is a key grabber for X, xbindkeys-config is a GUI front-end, and xvkbd is a virtual keyboard for X, which can be used to simulate key strokes. Now execute this command to create the default config file for xbindkeys:\nxbindkeys --defaults > /home/your-user-name/.xbindkeysrc\n\nNow run xbindkeys from the terminal followed by xbindkeys-config. \nThe GUI front-end of xbindkeys shoots up. Add a new entry. The process should be self explanatory. Here is how that command entry in Action field should look like:\nxvkbd -xsendevent -text \"text-to-be-auto-typed\"\n\nApply and Save. You are almost done. You need this hotkey to work even after reboot.

During the trial period you can try the app without buying it. The Ubuntu Software Center prompts you to log in with Ubuntu One before you can install the app, so that Ubuntu One will have a record that you installed the app and the date when you installed it.\n", "Q: Installing Chrome correctly I'm a longtime Windows user but I've been interested in Linux for quite some time as a possible alternative.  I've dabbled with it a number of times but just installed 15.04 GNOME as a dual boot with Windows 8.1 and definitely like what I see so far; it sure reminds me of my days as a Mac user.\nAnyway, I'm quite comfortable with tinkering so I downloaded and installed Google Chrome (i.e. not Chromium) by grabbing the package from Google's website.  It installed and runs fine, but it doesn't show up in the Ubuntu Software Center's list of installed apps.  How can I get it to show up correctly?  If I ever need to uninstall it I'd like to be able to do so through the Software Center GUI.\nThanks,\nLuke\n\nA: I'm fairly new to Ubuntu aswell, but maybe this will help:\nWhy isn't Google Chrome available in the Software Centre?\n\nA: You can't see Chrome in Software Center, because you installed it not from Ubuntu repositories.\nYou can easily remove it from terminal by running\nsudo dpkg -r google-chrome-stable\n\nOr using Synaptic program. It is a GUI application.\n", "Q: Wifi slow and unstable on HP Probook 450 G2 under 15.04 HP Probook 450G2 notebook with Ubuntu 15.04 here (RTL8723BE wlan chip).\nDefault, fully updated kernel gives horrible throughput (about 600-800 KBytes/sec over FTP on same VLAN when just under the access point). It's very unstable as well, drops as close as 10m from the AP in direct view.\nI've compiled and installed lwfinger's rtlwifi new driver from Github.\nThis new source has significantly improved network throughput under very optimal conditions (right next to the access point). FTP transfers now over 1 MByte/s.\nHowever in real-life conditions, performance still is very poor, signal drops to 1Mb/s speed only 20 meters away from AP in direct view (hospital corridor). Roaming between APs is slow and unstable as well and connection drops completely sometimes. Same notebook under Windows 7 gives very decent speed and connection stability in the same places. A whole world of difference... Any hopes for more improvement to come? are issues known and worked on or is it still quite shady at this time? I need to make a decision as to the deployment of these nootebooks and I'd hate having to push them out with Windows aboard (they're being used as thin clients for Citrix-published apps).\nI can help in any possible way such as gathering debug output if this is needed.\nEDIT : this is not a duplicate of \"RTL8723be: poor and unstable wireless in Ubuntu (from 14.04 to 15.04)\" as suggested. Well, it might actually be because using lwfinger's rtlwifi new driver precisely was the answer given there.

I plan to reformat partitions one and two as above and keep the /home one. \nWill I be able to tell Ubuntu to do so during an installation? By this I mean: Will it be able to recognize the /home partition and keep all its data intact while formatting the rest? And one more question: Will it be able to keep the users as they are our will I be forced to change them too? (I have the bad feeling that it won't be able to keep the users as they are...)\n\nA: Keep the /home partition\nYes! You can keep the existing home partition using one of the advanced installation options called Something Else\n\nAfter choosing this option, you will be able to tell the installation process to use the existing / and /home partitions. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to choose to format / partition as ext4 and\n\n*Not format (remove the check mark) the /home partition.\n\n\nKeeping the users\nBefore you start the install process\nFrom inside the Mageia installation, run the follwoing command:\ncat /etc/passwd\n\nThis will give you the list of current usernames and user-numbers. Write the names and numbers down, as you will need them later when you recreate the users in Ubuntu. Thanks Arronical for the comment.\nDuring installation\nDuring Ubuntu you will be prompted to create the first user. This user will have sudo privileges. This user is internally identified as user number 1000. Assuming that Mageia uses the same convention, you should use the same username you had before. Ubuntu will setup to use your existing /home/username.\nAfter installation\nFor all other users, you will have to wait till after the installation. See Why can't I click the button to add a new user? for details. If you create them in the same order as you did in Mageia, they will get user numbers in the same order as 1001, 1002, etc. Again, use the same usernames, and their existing home folders will be assigned to them. (You will be prompted to choose the existing folders or create new ones.)\nCleaning up\nNote: your home folder /home/$USER contains your data as well as configuration files (your preferences) for the applications you use. These are kept in hidden folders with names starting with a dot (.). Since configurations in Mageia may not always match that in Ubuntu, you may get some errors when running an application for the first time. If this happens, you may need to delete the corresponding folder (or file) with dot in the the beginning. Alternately, you may want to delete all the hidden folders and files inside your home folder to get a fresh start in terms of application configuration.\nAlso see Changing to another distro: can the -home partition be kept?\nHope this helps\n", "Q: dpkg-query is not displaying all files installed from package I installed postgresql from the package manager \nsudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib\n\nand I want to know what files it installed, including any startup scripts or modifications to any shell scripts.\nWhen I run dpkg-query, this is the output:\n# dpkg-query -L postgresql\n/.\n/usr\n/usr/share\n/usr/share/doc\n/usr/share/doc/postgresql\n/usr/share/doc/postgresql/changelog.gz\n/usr/share/doc/postgresql/copyright\n\nAs you can see, it is not listing a lot of the crucial files, including (but not limited to):\n/usr/lib/postgresql (the binaries)\n/var/lib/postgresql (the data directory and the database initialization via initdb)\n/etc/postgresql (the configuration files)\n/var/log/postgresql (the log file)\n\nAlso I want to know what changes it made to global startup scripts in order for it to be loaded when operating system starts.\nWhy are all these important details missing from the output of dpkg-query and how can I list this information?\n\nA: So what is the problem?\nBack to Installation\n$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib\n\nwill give you a prompt\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  postgresql postgresql-9.1 postgresql-client-9.1 postgresql-client-common\n  postgresql-common postgresql-contrib postgresql-contrib-9.1\n\nSo you have to know not all of your specified files is just related to postgresql instead you should search for all of those packages\ndpkg-query -L postgresql postgresql-9.1 postgresql-client-9.1 postgresql-client-common postgresql-common postgresql-contrib postgresql-contrib-9.1\n\nSo now you can find all of your files.\nTo prove what I'm saying \n $ dpkg -S /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/psql\n\npostgresql-client-9.1: /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/man/man1/psql.1.gz\npostgresql-client-common: /usr/bin/psql\npostgresql-client-9.1: /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/psqlrc.sample\npostgresql-client-9.1: /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/psql\n\nThis is a sample of a files in /usr/lib/postgresql/* and it proves it is not in the postgresql package, so you have what package to search for\nThanks to @steeldriver comment:\n\nIn addition, there may be files that are not part of any package's\n  contents, but are instead created on-the-fly by a post-install\n  (postinst) script - and removed by the corresponding postrm script\n  upon package removal.\n\n", "Q: My Ubuntu system will not boot from GRUB until I select it from the boot menu Okay, I went through the installation process to have dual OS; windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04. No matter what I do my computer WILL NOT boot from the grub menu. To clarify I have already:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabled secure boot and fast start\n\n*run boot repair from Ubuntu side\n\n*manually set bootmgr using Windows bcdedit:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nIf I do nothing and allow my computer to boot on its own I am directed to Windows.\nIf I go into the BIOS to reorder my boot options, my options do not include GRUB or Ubuntu\nIn order to access the Ubuntu partition I have to hit esc as my computer is booting and go into boot option menu where I have 6 different \"ubuntu\" options (none of which appear in my BIOs settings, as mentioned), all exactly the same in appearance except the working option is the only one that begins with a lower case \"u\". the rest indefinitely load a black screen.\nAfter choosing the working Ubuntu option I am finally presented with the GRUB menu and my options are \nUbuntu            # takes me to OS\nAdvanced options for Ubuntu\nWindows UEFI bootmgfw.efi \nWindows boot UEFI loader\n\nthen 10 options that begin with EFI/... \nWindows Boot Manager (on /dev/sda2)   # takes me to Windows \nSystem Setup. \n\nI don't get why I have so many options here.\nI have tried to use gparted to mess with partitions as I see other answers giving several solutions that way. However I have read here in the Ubuntu help wiki that a new boot partition for a computer with Windows first need to be implemented via the Windows side to get it within the first 100 GB.\nI am really just scared to continue making changes. I know my way somewhat around a computer, but I feel like there's a lot wrong here. I just want to boot from GRUB, have 2 options: Windows or Ubuntu. What now?\n\nA: First, a separate /boot partition (as described on the page to which you linked) will do no good. In fact, setting one up could complicate matters in a way that will make it harder to find a solution. Thus, you should not pursue this option.\nSecond, you say you disabled \"fast start,\" but it's not 100% clear from your description if you're referring to a firmware option or to the Windows option called \"Fast Startup\" (or sometimes \"Hybrid Boot\"). If the former, you should disable Fast Startup in Windows, as described here (among many other places). Fast Startup basically turns a shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk operation. One consequence of this change is that filesystems, including the EFI System Partition (ESP) on which boot loaders are stored, are left in an unsafe state. It's possible, although not all that likely, that your problems are a consequence of this fact. Thus, you should disable Fast Startup and try your fixes again -- or at least the bcdedit fix you've noted.\nIf that doesn't help, it sounds as if your firmware is buggy. Unfortunately, some EFIs ignore their boot settings. A firmware update (probably called a \"BIOS update\" on the manufacturer's page) may fix the problem, although you'll still need to use bcdedit in Windows, efibootmgr in Linux, or some other tool, to create an appropriate boot entry.\nIf neither disabling Fast Startup nor updating the firmware fixes the problem and if the computer is new enough, I recommend you return it to the store for a refund and buy something else, then write to the manufacturer and tell them why you returned the computer. Unless and until people start returning their defective computers, manufacturers won't even know the problem exists, much less be motivated to fix it.\nIf the computer is not new enough to return, you'll need to engage in some type of workaround. The simplest of these is probably to rename your boot loader files so that GRUB gets the name that's normally used by the Windows boot loader (EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi on the ESP). The Boot Repair tool has an option to do this (and move the Microsoft boot loader and update GRUB appropriately) on its Advanced options menu. It's called something like \"Back up and rename boot files,\" but I don't recall the precise phrase used.\nAs to your excessive number of menu options in GRUB, I'm not certain of the cause, except in general terms: The scripts that create those boot entries can become confused and generate too many entries. Some people say that the GRUB Customizer tool can help tame the menu in such situations, but I've never used it myself. (I'm not a GRUB fan, and prefer to use almost anything else instead, -- but switching to another boot loader most likely won't solve your primary problem, since it must be registered with the EFI just like GRUB.)\n\nA: UPDATE: My Windows updated (I do not know what the update was) and after that my computer now boots to the GRUB menu. I made no other changes to my computer so I am assuming somehow the update could have possibly addressed the problem?\nMy only remaining issue is the fact that I'm still getting 10+ options on the GRUB menu. Ubuntu and the windows option I mention both work for booting to either OS, even though I would like the menu cleaned up I am satisfied for now that at least it is all working correctly. If anyone knows how to clean up the grub menu I am eager to know. I haven't researched this problem yet so I won't be creating a new question until I have looked into it.

If the symlink doesn't fit, space is allocated normally (so you end up with a single block allocation), which may be optimized by the filesystem using tail merging (but there is no API for du to know about this).\nThe ext4 filesystem performs this optimization for symlinks only, the criteria are found in the function ext4_inode_is_fast_symlink.\n\nA: Symbolic links take the room it takes to store the name and target plus a few bytes for other metadata. \nSo it is the size of the symlink.\nRegarding the size from du -sh: du  only looks at how many blocks are allocated, and so may show 0.stat and ls -l are better in showing the size in that regard.\n\nA: This is size of the symlink file in bytes.\nSymlink file is a normal file that stores data regarding where is the file it is pointing to. In ext 4 it is 7 bytes.\n", "Q: no files in grive Google Drive Folder I have installed grive .

With the latest (tested) proprietary Nvidia drivers installed, how can you find out if Nvidia SLI is enabled? Can you check in the \"Nvidia X Server Settings\" application? Command-line?\n(Running Ubuntu 15.04 x64 w/ two Nvidia Geforce 660's)\n\nA: The SLI connector is a proprietary link between GPUs that transmits synchronization, display, and pixel data.\nThe SLI connector enables inter-GPU communication of up to 1 Gb/s, consuming no bandwidth over the PCI Express bus.\nSLI is enabled by setting the SLI option in the X configuration file.\nThe nvidia-xconfig utility can be used to set the SLI option, rather than modifying the X configuration file by hand.\nnvidia-xconfig --sli=on\n\nThe valid values for SLI are Off, On, Auto, AFR, SFR, AA, and AFRofAA.\nFor further information, look at man nvidia-xconfig.\nCheck if SLI is enabled\nThe only way to check if SLI is enabled is by checking first GPU and seeing what it says as the Screen0 it should say your screen model and then SLI.\nSource\n", "Q: Definitive Guide to Wifi Dropping Consistently This age-old problem seems to never go away.\nThere are thousands of threads related to Wi-Fi dropping constantly.

Then I ran a script to fix the touchpad(which usually doesn't work properly at first with this type of laptop). \nAfter rebooting after running this script the laptop couldn't find wifi and sudo commands didn't work(it just loaded forever. I tried things like \"sudo echo \"hello\"\"). So I decided to reinstall the OS. So I reinstalled Chrome OS and did a \"powerwash\".\nWhen repeating the exact process(using LiveUSB with UNetbootin) I did last week it didn't work. After choosing the \"Start Uberstudent\" option from the blue UNetbootin-menu it stopped and displayed the error: \nKernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(2,0)\n\nI have tried switching usb and I tried installing Ubuntu instead. Both with the same result.\nThere are other similar questions on this site. The difference is that all of those were solved by booting into Ubuntu and doing things from there. But I don't have anything else but Chrome OS installed so they don't apply to my situation. \nThe script I used to fix my touchpad was cros-haswell-modules.sh\nmodified by using\n# Grab Ubuntu kernel source\nwget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.12.5.tar.xz\ntar -xJf linux-3.12.5.tar.xz\ncd linux-3.12.5\n\ninstead of \n# Grab Ubuntu kernel source\napt-get source linux-image-$mykern\ncd $mykernver\n\nas instructed by this site.

And the rest of the laptop should be working fine too since I bought it two weeks ago.\nAnyone here knows how to fix this kernel panic when i don't already have Ubuntu installed?\nAny help is appreciated\n\nA: Last week I installed Ubuntu on my desktop and got the same error. I thought it was my SSD but it appeared to be the USB with Ubuntu on it. \nI formatted the USB drive on my other Windows PC and downloaded Ubuntu again. Then created a bootable drive with Rufus https://rufus.akeo.ie/ which also let's you check for bad blocks on the stick. \nAfter that I tried installing again and it worked.\n\nA: Problem is a file system of USB drive. Downloading another copy of Ubuntu is not necessary, just start Rufus and format disk as fat32. Worked for me.\n\nA: Same problem happen to me. But this works for me. While writing image in Rufus first write the usb in freedos then write the image with the dd format instead of iso. This is due to ubuntu packed in hybrid mode which able to write as iso or dd format. dd format works for me.\n", "Q: How to delete all Desktop UI I install Elementary-Desktop on Ubuntu 14.04, after install and work with that, I don't like Elementary-Desktop and Delete that but Unity to Demolished.\nI try for built Unity (reset, reinstall) but No effect!\nNow, how to Delete all Desktop UI and reinstall Unity ?\nThis is my Unity:\n\n\nA: Test this:\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the Grub menu.\nSelect the line which starts with Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with recovery mode\nYour PC should display a menu with a number of options. \nSelect In this order: Network  -- Drop to root shell prompt.\nIn the terminal run:\nmount -o remount, rw /\nmount --all\napt-get update\napt-get install --reinstall aptitude deborphan ppa-purge\naptitude remove '?and(?reverse-depends(elementary),?not(?reverse-depends(?exact-name(ubuntu-desktop))))'\napt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\napt-get dist-upgrade\ndeborphan\napt-get --purge remove $(deborphan)\ndeborphan --libdevel\napt-get --purge remove $(deborphan --libdevel)\ndeborphan --find-config\ndpkg --purge $(deborphan --find-config)\napt-get autoremove\napt-get clean\nppa-purge ppa:elementary-os/daily\nreboot\n\nSource\n", "Q: i want to setup openstack please help I am looking at starting a small backup company in my country and i was hoping to use openstack to build my private cloud... and also the main backup software I use loves Swift.

There was little information online; everything was telling me to do what the only other answer in this thread says, changing the ports deluge was using. This didn't work, so I began changing random settings and seeing if they affected it. On the below screen I had everything set to -1, and as soon as I changed them Deluge started working fine. I'm not sure which setting it is but I don't care, as long as I can torrent.\n\n\nA: There is one thing to do: check in preferences if deluge sees the port it uses as \"open\" with the \"test active port\" check. Do not use \"random ports\" and use ports between 50000 and 59999 (the default ports used by torrent programs are sometimes blocked by ISPs).\n\nIf it does not show it is active you need to open the ports you selected in your router in the section \"port forwarding\". Here is a how to for a lot of routers (but with uTorrent but that does not matter for the router settings).\n\nbut not in the web deluge\n\nThat one uses your internet port. \n\nA: I tried all methods proposed above, that didn't work. I restarted deluge and changed ports many times. \nI also checked it with deluge -L debug, but the error was not there. \nI deleted all my torrents. Restarted deluge. It started to work. \nNow everything works, but when I 'test active port', it shows the yellow triangle with exclamation (though it's no longer shown in the bottom line of the main window). So don't pay much attention to that 'test'. \n\nA: I terminate processes that use certain port (in my case was 4001), it blocks incoming connections:\nsudo lsof -i tcp:4001\nkill -9 (process id)\n\nThen I close Deluge, reopen it and it works as normal.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 won't boot after installing CUDA 7 I got a laptop (Dell Precision M4700) with a Quadro K2000M.

I stumbled upon the the double reboot solution that @Galto mentioned by accident, but it seems to work reliably. I first reboot using the original generic kernel, 3.13.0-32-generic (without the CUDA packages installed), and then (without even needing to log in completely) I am able to reboot into the latest kernel (with CUDA installed). If I try boot directly to the latest kernel without the first step, the Ubuntu boot sequence just hangs without reaching the login screen... \na \"hacky\" solution, but workable for now...\n", "Q: Screen colours shifted I have an Eee with Ubuntu 14.04 installed, and recently I noticed a shifted in the screen colours: the whites are still white and the black are still black, but now light colours are in shades of light blue, and the dark ones are in shades of dark blue (see image below).\nI tried to fix the problem changing the theme but it didn't work.

Thanks\n\nA: To put the zip file in the correct directory:\nDate=$(date +\"%m-%d-%Y\")\nzip -r \"/mnt/backups/backup.$Date\" /home/folder/folder\n\nOne should avoid using all caps for shell variables.  The important system variables are all capitals and you don't want to accidentally overwrite one of them.  Thus, the above uses the mixed-case Date instead of DATE.\nI would, as you suggested, .zip as the suffix.  This avoids possible confusion in the future.  Also, there is no need here to create a Date variable at all:\nzip -r \"/mnt/backups/backup.$(date +\"%m-%d-%Y\").zip\" /home/folder/folder\n\nFinally, dates in the month-day-year format do not sort properly.  The yyyy-mm-dd format will sort naturally in the right order.  The abbreviation for this common format is %F.

This utility finds the scanner and works OK.\nBut neither simplescan nor xsane can find the scanner.  Can anyone suggest an approach to get these programs to recognize the scanner?\n\nA: Canon does not develop SANE drivers for their scanners but they provide an own solution scangearmp for basic scan functions.

You must not attempt to access any partitions that may appear to be on the individual drives.  Instead you mount the correct partition on the raid device.  Further, intel fakeraid assembles the drives into a \"container\" which is then subdivided into individual raid arrays.  It appears you have activated the container and I believe that automatically activates any other arrays it contains, but they are something other than /dev/md0.  cat /proc/mdstat to see what arrays are active, or you might consult lsblk and it is one of the other arrays ( or partition on that array, such as /dev/md1p1 ) that should contain the filesystem you want to mount.\n", "Q: Need to manually change scaling when remote desktop connecting to high resolution display I have a Windows 8.1 desktop machine with a 27\" QHD monitor. Under Control Panel\\Appearance and Personalization\\Display, I have set \"Change the size of all items\" to medium (recommended) so I can comfortably read the font on my QHD screen.\nI then want to remote desktop from my linux notebook with a 15\" FHD screen, so I set the remote desktop resolution to 1920x1080 in Remmina and connect to the server. The problem is the font and titlebars are huge.\nIf I go into the display settings in my remote desktop session, the \"Change the size of all items\" setting is on the lowest (Smallest) setting and is grayed out regardless. I can click on \"Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays and set the scaling to 100%. After logging out and back into my remote desktop session the font and title bars are all scaled nicely to a usable size, which is great! Then I log back into my desktop machine directly and the font is minuscule, so I need to increase the scaling settings on my desktop again.\nI have tried searching for other people with the same problem and my search terms are either bad or no one else has the same problem or setup, which I find hard to believe.\nI would really like to find a good fix so I don't need to use a clumsy workaround of changing the DPI every time I log in from a different machine.\n\nA: gconf-editor should allow you to set adjust the font DPI, effectively scaling it dynamically. See this answer\n\n", "Q: Grub not booting up Hey guys I have a question about grub. \nI am trying to dualboot windows7 and linux however I am recving a problem with grub. It will just boot into windows. \nI also delated the system reserved partioton because of hopeless. \nI tried to use grubrescue tool and it says this \nGPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again.\n\nThe paste that it gives me for help is this. \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/11508445/\nI have plenty of unlocated space so I dont see why it is telling me this. Any help?\n\nA: Here's your problem (from your Boot Repair output):\nWarning: /dev/sda contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table.\nHowever, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.\nPerhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT\npartition tables.  Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an\nmsdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?\n\nIt looks like your disk used GPT at one point, but when you (re-)installed Windows, you did so in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. That often results in leftover GPT data, which tends to confuse libparted-based tools, resulting in various errors and problems.\nThe simplest and safest solution is to use my FixParts tool (command name: fixparts), which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. The referenced page provides details, but in brief, launching FixParts on the disk should cause it to ask if you want to delete the leftover GPT data. Confirm that deletion and then quit from the program.\n", "Q: I got a problem upgrading packages on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS root@ubuntu:~# su\nroot@ubuntu:~# apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists...

Anything will help. I am still able to use the system and have wifi enabled on Ubuntu OS. Nothing seems to work when I try to apply the security updates it still throws that error.\n\nA: I have run into similar problems when following command line instructions to the letter, and I think I know why this is.  What I find works when this happens is to go to the GRAPHICAL update screen and press \"check\".  Doing so updates the update catalog, or at least that's how I explain it.  It's worth a try and may very well fix your problem.\nPlease see the \"check\" button next to the \"install updates\" button.\n\n", "Q: Merge all files from directory tree I have a directory called /home/foobar/ which contain numerous text files in numerous sub directories.

When I go to that folder with any file manager it gets stuck in loading.\nHow can I go there and view or delete images?\n\nA: Automatically divide your files into a (recursive) directory with an arbitrary number of files per (sub) folder / folders per superior folder\nThe easiest and IMHO most efficient way is to have a script reorganize the files into folders, if necessary even different layers of directory levels. This will make your files browsable without choking nautilus.\nThe script below will do that for you. It will create folders with an arbitrary number of files. These folders will be organized into sub folders if they exceed an (the same) arbitrary number, etc. In other words; each (sub-) level will have the same maximum number of files / sub directories, making browsing easily possible.\nEach of the created folders shows the folder number + the number of created sub levels (where e.g. 22_1 only contains files):\n\nThe test\nI tested in on a directory of 300.000 files, to be reorganized in chunks of (max) 100 files, to be organized into superior directories of (max) 100 folders etc.\nIt took less then a minute on my system. A test of 100.000 files into smaller chunks was a matter of seconds.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\n#--- set the directory to reorganize below\ndr = \"/path/to/directory\"\n#--- set the number of files/folders per level\nsize = 100\n\nlevel = 0\ndef move(fn, drn, level):\n    folder = dr+\"/\"+str(drn)+\"_\"+str(level)\n    if not os.path.exists(folder):\n        os.mkdir(folder)\n    shutil.move(dr+\"/\"+f, folder+\"/\"+f)\n\nwhile len(os.listdir(dr)) > size:\n    level += 1\n    fn = 0; drn = 1\n    for f in os.listdir(dr):\n        if fn < size:\n            move(fn, drn, level)\n        else:\n            fn = 0\n            drn += 1\n            move(fn, drn, level)\n        fn += 1\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty folder, save it as reorganize.py\n\n*In the head section, set the path to your directory, the desired number of files per subdirectory (= equal to folders per containing directory).\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/reorganize.py\n\nNote\nThe script (as it is) just creates a directory structure where each level has a defined number of files/folders. It does not take into account any kind of organisation by name, date or whatever.\n\nEDIT\nAs requested in a comment, a script to move the files back into one flat directory after having processed the files.\nThe usage is pretty much the same. As directory, set the same directory as the first script, but that seems obvious.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\n#--- set the directory, the same as the first script\ndr = \"/path/to/directory\"\n#---\n\n# move the files back\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(dr):\n    for file in files:\n        shutil.move(root+\"/\"+file, dr+\"/\"+file)\n# remove the (now empty) subdirectories\nfor d in os.listdir(dr):\n    folder = dr+\"/\"+d\n    if os.path.isdir(folder):\n        shutil.rmtree(folder)\n\nNote\nAs mentioned in a comment, the script assumes there is not risk of name clashes, since all files initially came from the same (flat) directory.\n\nA: This is a problem in the file manager nautilus when working with directories containing large number of files, this is described in this bug.\nI advise you in this case to use some fast File manager. you can use gnome-commander it's 5X to 6X times faster than nautilus and this ratio gets bigger when dealing with large number of files. It's not that pretty GUI but it should help you to fix your problem.\nTo install it:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-commander\n\nNow open the directory with large number of files:\ngnome-commander /path-to-dir\n\n\nA: I don't have any personal experience with libraries that big, but I've heard good about dolphin.\nDolphin is the file manager used in KDE distributions such as Kubuntu. You can install it and run it just fine on the Ubuntu Desktop, although the footprint might be quite large, as it has to download and install a lot of KDE dependencies.\nDownload Dolphin File Manager\nAnother approach might be to use a photomanager. I would assume such tools would be optimized to display large collections.\nFor photomanagers there are quite a few alternatives, but a couple of popular ones are:\nShotwell, \nDigikam and \nF-Spot\n\nA: I tried Thunar file manager with images in the order of 10,000. Displays thumbnails fairly quickly on local drives and opens network drives too but much slower. I have not tried it for a larger number of files, though. But at least, it does a much better job than Nautilus without compromising the graphical interface\nsudo apt-get install thunar\nThere is also a script to make it your default File Manager (if you like it). You can find the script here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DefaultFileManager\n\nA: You could go through terminal to that folder , do gnome-open image.jpg or xdg-open image.jpg , which should open one of the images with gnome-image-viewer or more commonly known as eye of gnome(eog). Next, if you hit F9 or go to View -> Image Gallery you can preview thumbnails.\n", "Q: sudo and apt-get not found I'm handling server as RA which was passed down to me by another graduated RA but I'm new and fresh to this environment facing a few issues right now.

Then I'm trying to run some command but it shows sudo: not found.\nNOTE:username is ROOT. NOT THE ROOT PRIVILLEGE.\nI tried surfing for solution which asked me to install sudo with apt-get install sudo but apt-get: not found popped out. \nSince I'm accessing via PuTTY, I'm not able to get into grub menu for root shell prompt. I did a reboot but it didn't help.\nPlease help me on this issue, I highly appreciate all solutions.\n\nA: The whole purpose of sudo is to temporarily allow you to do what root can do. \nIf another person has been putting it together from scratch, it is highly probable that person got rid of sudo. As long as you can use root account, you can do everything you need.\n\nA: Like @terdon I'm suspecting your server is not Ubuntu. (Also, please consider that people reading your questions are not in your context. What's a RA? A research assistant?)\nIs the server a physical machine nearby that you happen to access through Putty, some remote machine in a remote datacenter, something else ? Also please run cat /etc/lsb-release to get hints. \nRegarding root user, some hosting services provide an account that is named root and has somehow more rights that regular account yet is not actually a full superuser. In that case it's somehow logical that sudo is not available.\nRegarding apt-get, presumably you wanted to use it to install some software.

(My motivation was to avoid horrific lag when moving windows, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwBH_AkhW_Q.)\nTo develop the tool, I examined the USB traffic from the Windows Logitech software using Wireshark.  I noticed the software using two HID \"feature reports\": one for the sampling rate and another for the DPI level.  The DPI level report had ID 0x8e with a second byte of 3, 4, 5, or 6.  I think they correspond to 400, 800, 1800, and 3600 DPI.\nDuring development of this script, though, I noticed that the device is also happy with a DPI level of 7.  It turns out that if I set the DPI to 7, then the DPI+/DPI- buttons no longer adjust the DPI and instead send an event visible with xev.  The DPI-default button is always visible with xev.\nI'm guessing that DPI-6 and DPI-7 are both 3600 DPI.  (My other guess had been that DPI-7 would retain the pre-7 DPI (e.g. DPI-3 followed by DPI-7 would be 400 DPI), but that doesn't appear to be the case.)\nTo set DPI-7, just run logitech-g400-config.py set -d3600_frozen (after installing libhidapi and maybe setting up udev -- see the README for details).  The high DPI might make the mouse pointer very fast.  I'm personally using DPI-5 right now with a bunch of xinput settings to tweak the acceleration.\n", "Q: Ubuntu software center not opening error \"countrycode\" I have an error which is exactly the same with this one Software Center not opening -- Keyerror: 'countrycode'\nI'm not sure whether it is because I chose to download update in the system setting from an US server while I'm living in malaysia.

In the end it asks me install: you may need to run ldconfig.\n\nA: \nI've installed readline by using ./configure, make, make install. At\n  the end it ask me install: you may need to run ldconfig.\n\nSo you just need to run the command\nsudo ldconfig\n\nWhat is ldconfig\nldconfig is a program that is used to maintain the shared library cache. This cache is typically stored in the file /etc/ld.so.cache and is used by the system to map a shared library name to the location of the corresponding shared library file\nman ldconfig\n ldconfig - configure dynamic linker run-time bindings\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       ldconfig  creates,  updates,  and removes the necessary links and cache\n       (for use by the run-time linker,  ld.so)  to  the  most  recent  shared\n       libraries  found  in  the directories specified on the command line, in\n       the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/usr/lib  and\n       /lib).   ldconfig  checks the header and file names of the libraries it\n       encounters when determining which  versions  should  have  their  links\n       updated.  ldconfig ignores symbolic links when scanning for libraries.\n\nFor more information see : What-does-ldconfig-do?\n\nUPDATE: solution for -bash: ldconfig: command not found\nAs told in comments below when you ran the echo $PATH gives\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games\n\nwhile ldconfig is inside /sbin which is outside the PATH, so you have then either to run the commands by absolute path like /sbin/ldconfig or correct your path.\nTo correct your PATH do  the following:\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nadd the line\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nNow save and exit then source .bashrc\nsource .bashrc\n\nSo now you can use the commands directly\n", "Q: What are the features in Snappy Ubuntu that make it more secure than the normal Ubuntu? I am thinking of using Snappy Ubuntu for IoT application. Security is important in IoT. What is the difference between Snappy Ubuntu and the normal Ubuntu that makes Snappy more secure compared to Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and server version?\n\nA: I don't think there is a huge differences in security model of all Ubuntu versions. Indeed according to this wiki:\n\nSnappy confinement is an evolution of the security model for Ubuntu\n  Touch. The basic concepts for confined applications and the AppStore\n  model pertain to snappy applications as well. In short, applications\n  are confined by default through the use of various technologies and\n  this is achieved through a simple template-based system where policy\n  is extended through the use of caps (aka policy groups).\n\nI think the most important will ran through the package system using click and the core itself, plus the filesystem capabilities.\nI think you should read those:\n\n\n*\n\n*ApplicationConfinement\n\n*SnappyConfinement\n", "Q: Modifying php.ini - Wont see any changes after edit I got a server that runs :\nPHP Version 5.5.9-1 ubuntu 4.9\nI wanted to edit the \"correct\" php.ini file so i can enable some features.\nFirst of all i used:\nroot@server ~ # find / -name php.ini\n\n/opt/psa/admin/conf/php.ini\n/opt/plesk/php/5.3/etc/php.ini\n/opt/plesk/php/5.5/etc/php.ini\n/opt/plesk/php/5.4/etc/php.ini\n/opt/plesk/php/5.6/etc/php.ini\n/var/www/vhosts/system/mysiteyo/etc/php.ini\n/etc/php5/cgi/php.ini\n/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n/etc/php5/cli/php.ini\n/etc/psa-webmail/horde/horde/php.ini\n/etc/psa-webmail/roundcube/php.ini\n\nI read from a previous thread that I should edit the /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini file.\nI also created a phpinfo(); script and run it from my browser.\nThe configuration file Path @ phpinfo  was the /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini but the loaded configuration file was : \n/var/www/vhosts/system/mysiteyo/etc/php.ini \n\nAs I opened the above file, I saw this:\n; ATTENTION! ;  \n; DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE BECAUSE IT WAS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY, \n; SO ALL YOUR CHANGES WILL BE LOST THE NEXT TIME THE FILE IS GENERATED.\n\nSo I thought that this file is somehow generated from one of the other php.ini files.\nThen i renamed both files (/etc/php5/cgi && /etc/php5/apache2) as php_tmp.ini and loaded my new modified php.ini file.\nAfter that i restarted apache2:\nroot@server ~ # /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nAlthough as i rerun the phpinfo(); script, I can't see any changes. I changed kinda half of the scripts I found with the find command, but I got the feeling that I'm doing something completely wrong.\nCould someone enlighten me, if I've missed something or am doing something wrong? I think that this auto-generated file is the problem but I don't know from where it is getting generated to edit that file.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: You've identified the correct php.ini file where you're configuration options are coming from. Its the file shown in the output of phpinfo(), which in your case is /var/www/vhosts/system/mysiteyo/etc/php.ini.\nIf you were to modify that file and restart Apache, then you should see your changes in the output of phpinfo().\nThe problem you have is the file is autogenerated, so any changes you make will not be persistent. The question you need to answer is, what is generating that file and how is it doing it? My guess would be that you have some form of control panel, such as cPanel or Plesk which is creating the /var/www/vhosts/system/mysiteyo/etc/php.ini file. \n\nA: It is clear from the directory names that the system is managed by Plesk. Plesk manages all the different php.ini settings for each domain. It also has an inheritance model for php.ini configuration which may be specified at admin, tenant (user that can create more customers), subscription (dividing a share of customers resource allocation) and domain level, although to a greater extend domain is part of subscription.\nOnce you put a system in the hands of something like Plesk you have to let it do it's job exclusively, otherwise you'll enter a world of pain.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to Plesk\n\n*Home -> Subscriptions -> example.com -> Website & domain -> example.com -> PHP Settings\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and you can add any php.ini settings you like.\n\n*Hit save\n\n\nYou can now see the changes in /var/www/vhosts/system/example.com/etc/php.ini. The best thing about getting Plesk to manage the configuration for you, is that Plesk manages it all for you! So if you upgrade PHP (using the Plesk software manager) it will change all the core PHP configuration then re-apply all your specific changes.\n", "Q: Install VMWare under 15.04 I am trying to install VMWare under Ubuntu 15.04, which was successful but when I start it I get the following dialog:\n\nWhen then clicking install I get \n\nI checked the log file which tells me \n2015-06-02T12:55:08.669+01:00| vthread-3| W110: Failed to build vmnet.

After some digging it turns out that repository includes a fairly old version of PyLNP which contains a broken xdg-terminal script. (Worse still the pack additionally contains a redundant copy of xdg-terminal which is never used as the release bundles a binary copy of PyLNP!)\nMaybe you're like me and simply wanted to play the game. If so you can pretty much install some dependencies, download the original game, extract it and run the thing. Problem with that is that you're left with ASCII art instead of a nice graphical tileset.\nI spent an embarrassing amount of time this evening learning about the various moving parts and I finally came up with some (fairly) simple installation instructions: https://gist.github.com/kzar/341cbb885896e082acb6\n", "Q: Make owner of newly create files AND folders www-data instead of superuser/admin I've been struggling with permissions so far, and posted another question but identified what the problem was, without any way to fix it yet.\nMy setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Desktop with LAMP stack\n\n*5 \"users\" I created users I've create in the ubuntu server using sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false USERNAME and which are used to access the local network shared folders, i.e for the computers on my network to connect to the /var/www folder, shared using Samba.\n\n*EDIT: The purpose is to create sort of a \"master localhost\" where all the computers in my local network can work on the same website, locally (i do NOT have a static IP address thus the server can't be accessed from elsewhere).\n\n\nMy problem:\nCurrently when I create a new folder on /var/www/html (ex: Creating the folder /var/www/html/testsite1) using any computer of the network, this folder is automatically owned by boris:www-data (\"boris\" being the main admin user on my ubuntu desktop install, and it shows indeed boris:www-data when running ls -l on the newly created folder), which is causing problems with my current setup (using Duplicator Plugin for wordpress by LifeInTheGrid mostly). \nHowever, both my /var/www and my /var/www/html are owned by www-data:www-data\nHence, I would like to know how I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change ownership to www-data:www-data of all files AND directories below /var/www and /var/www/html\n\n*Make sure any file or folder I will create with any of the users of my network will automatically be owned by www-data:www-data (That includes files automatically created by php scripts as it is what the Duplicator plugin does if I'm not wrong).\nIs there a way to do that?\nNote: I am a super newbie with things related to Linux and command lines, but I catch up fast.\nNote 2: umask is already set as 0002\nEDIT:\nTried this:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/\n\nAnd then set setuid and setgid bits by doing this:\nsudo chmod u+s /var/www/html\nsudo chmod g+s /var/www/html\n\nThen logged-off, restarted apache, and tried to create a new folder using a Mac connected to my server through network IP (local IP, not static).\nI Ran\nls -l on /var/www/html\n\nOutput is still:\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 boris   www-data  testsite1\n\nNote:\nI already checked my apache config before and envvars, it is already set to:\nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nEDIT: I tried it backwards, e.g setting up everything to be owned by boris:www-data and set my envvars apache config to boris:www-data. IT WORKED! \nHere is what I did:\nChanged envvars to\nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=boris\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nRan\nsudo chown -R boris:www-data /var/www/\n\nRestarted Apachem, created a new folder, add my files, ran the plugin, now says it's good !!!\n\nA: To make sure any file or folder you create in /var/www/html gets automatically owned by www-data you can use inotify, it's like cron but monitors folders/files for changes in attribuets, file creations, modifications and much more.\nFirst install it with:\n$ sudo apt-get install incron\n\nAllow root to use incron by opening /etc/incron.allow with:\n$ sudo vim /etc/incron.allow\n\nand add root to the file, then save and exit.\nEdit your incrontab with:\n$ sudo incrontab -u root -e\n\nand add the following line to it:\n/var/www/html IN_CREATE /bin/chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/\n\nsave and exit.\nNow as soon as a file is created in the /var/www/html direcotry it will automatically set onwership to www-data:www-data. \nExplanation of the line in incrontab:\n/var/www/html is the directory that will be monitored.\nIN_CREATE will watch for created files. It's the file change mask. \n/bin/chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/ is the command/action to execute.\n\nA: \nChange ownership to www-data:www-data of all files AND directories below /var/www and /var/www/html\n\ncd /var/www/\nchown -R  www-data:www-data /var/www/\n\n\n\n*\n\n*./html is implied here (as being part of /var/www/)\n\n*-R makes it recursive (so it will traverse all directories in /var/www/).\n\n\n\nMake sure any file or folder I will create with any of the users of my network will automatically be owned by www-data:www-data\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside /var/www/html/ I would assume?\n\n\nSet your apache config to www-data. See /etc/apache2/envvars\n# envvars - default environment variables for apache2ctl\n\nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nYou need to restart apache after editing this (sudo service apache restart).\n\nThat includes files automatically created by php scripts as it is what the Duplicator plugin does if I'm not wrong).\n\nThe problem here probably is not the plugin but php. The user should be the same process that PHP runs under. So you probably need to set that to www-data too if that is your user and group (/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini).\n\nA: I solved it ! I still think it was an Apache envvars problem, but unsure if that is the particular thing that solved the problem... Anyway here is what I did:\nChanged envvars to\nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=boris\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nRan\nsudo chown -R boris:www-data /var/www/\n\nNow it's working so far. Will test further...\n\nA: Answer to Question #1: Recursive chown\nA recursive chown will let you set ownership and group to what you want for /var/www/....  This is the command you should use:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/\n\nWith that, every file and folder will be set as such inside there with those ownership permissions.\n\nHalf-Answer to Question #2: setgid bit\nIf you want default group ownership on files, set the setgid bit on the /var/www/html folder.  New files should then be created with that group as stated on the folder.\nsudo chmod g+s /var/www/html\n\nYou'll need to set write permissions, though, if any user OTHER than www-data is writing to the directories, and doing so can open you to a security hole or two if you're not careful.\nYou end up with permissions being $USER:www-data; to change the owner you then use a chown as indicated in method #1 (that said, in a proper setup you should rely on group permissions, not user owner permissions, for access to the web files).\n\nPHP Wordpress Duplicator Problem\nThe problem with permissions is the user/group PHP runs as needs write and read and likely +x on the directory to edit the dir structure and such.\nPHP runs as www-data by default in Ubuntu installs which use the default configurations.  Ideally, your steps above would make the issue fixed, as you're stuck with the Duplicator Plugin being a PHP plugin.\nIdeally you should also check the documentation for the Duplicator Plugin to verify what permissions it needs to run and work.\n", "Q: Dell T7400 won't boot Ubuntu unless the live USB is connected Ubuntu server 14.04\nI have a Dell Precision T7400 with onboard SAS controller.  After installing Ubuntu from LinuxLive USB USB drive, the machine freezes at the boot screen.  I don't get any splash screens; this is happening well before that.

The BIOS boot order is the USB first and the local drive second.  I have not configured any RAID with the SAS controller.\nI had Oracle Enterprise Linux installed (6.4) and it works no problem.\n\nA: It was a very simple error - GRUB was on the USB.

Arguments should be a subsystem name and a command (with optional arguments) to execute upon subsystem request.\nThe command sftp-server(8) implements the “sftp” file transfer subsystem.\n\n*Match Match Group sftpusers\nIntroduces a conditional block.  If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisified, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.\nThe arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).\n\n*ChrootDirectory ChrootDirectory /sftp/%u\nSpecifies the pathname of a directory to chroot(2) to after authentication. All components of the pathname must be root-owned directories that are not writable by any other user or group. After the chroot, sshd(8) changes the working directory to the user's home directory.\n\n*ForceCommand ForceCommand internal-sftp\nForces the execution of the command specified by ForceCommand, ignoring any command supplied by the client and ~/.ssh/rc if present. The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with the -c option. This applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution.  It is most useful inside a Match block.  The command originally supplied by the client is available in the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable.

I read many threads that deal with this or similar issues, however, I did not manage to solve my problem yet. Here is the problem:\nI received a Dell Precision M4800 that came with Windows 7. I wanted to install Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS alongside with Windows (which I have done many times before on other machines). I tried from DVD and also from USB but always ended up with a black screen after I selected the language that should be used. \nThere exist several threads about this problem and the work-around described here worked for me: I booted Ubuntu using the options \"nomodeset\", \"acpi = off\" and \"nolapic\", and could then install Ubuntu as usual. \nWhen I then rebooted the system, I ended up with a purple screen. So I booted again, pressed \"e\" when the grub menu appeared, and replaced \"quiet splash\" by \"nomodeset\" as described in the above link. Ubuntu boots fine.\nThen I added the \"nomodeset\" option to the grup file as described in this link. Rebooting works fine now so I was happy since that seems not to have any weird side-effects according to this thread.\nHowever, now I wanted to connect a second screen to my laptop, which is recognized under Windows but is not under the fresh installed Ubuntu version, unfortunately. The reason for that is the \"nomodeset\" option which I need to boot my system successfully.\nI probably need other drivers than I currently use. My current setting looks as follows:. \nI selected the \"proprietary, tested\" version once and it then says that I use the recommended driver. However, when I then booted again, I could still enter my password but after logging in, I could not do anything (ctrl+alt+T did not open a terminal, there was no bar on the left anymore). I could get back to the current status by following the instructions made by Marco Scannadinari. Now I am not sure how to get the appropriate drivers for my graphics card. I run:\nlspci | grep VGA\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK106GLM [Quadro K2100M] (rev a1)\n\nand also:\ngrep -i chipset /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n[     3.606] (II) intel: Driver for Intel(R) Integrated Graphics Chipsets:\n[     3.607] (II) VESA: driver for VESA chipsets: vesa\n\nbut I am not sure how to use this information.\nMy questions - which are highly interconnected - are therefore:\n1) How do I get the second screen to work?\n2) How to I get rid of the nomodeset option in /etc/default/grub without ending up with a purple/black screen?\n3) Which drivers do I have to install for my graphics card and how to do this? \nThanks!\nEdit:\nI do not think that is a duplicate since it is not clear yet what the cause of my problem actually is. I already tried different drivers which did not solve my problem.If someone told me \"The problem is that you use/installed the wrong drivers which can be seen from the screenshot you posted so you need to follow the instructions in the link Fabby provides to install the appropriate drivers\" it would already be helpful. But even then it is hardly a duplicate.\n", "Q: Can't open Terminal! I've customized the terminal to put a transparency. But I put a start command \"dir\" to see what happen, now I open the terminal ,he makes a dir and closes. Before I could to change the default profile .\nHow I can edit the profile o change to the Default profile?\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu comes with 2 terminal emulators actually: one is gnome-terminal and the other is xterm, and as others suggested, there is always virtual tty consoles (which you can access through CtrlAltF3 , or really any f key from 1 to 6). Now, open xterm and run gnome-terminal -e 'YOLOSWAG' (note that  YOLOSWAG is just place holder, could be anything; the real purpose here is to bring up gnome-terminal complaining about a non-existent command being given to the -e flag, which stands for executing a command with gnome-terminal; read man gnome-terminal for more info on that). Now when you have gnome-terminal window open, you can right click and edit the profiles. Close the window (don't click relaunch) and reopen the gnome-terminal again.\nIn the image up above you can see that I've put custom command mkdir YOLO , which prevented the gnome-terminal window staying open (yes, in reality, your terminal was opening, just too fast and exited right away). I've called the terminal with the method described above.\n\nA: You need to remove the folder ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal (where the profiles are stored), and log out and back in before opening the terminal again(!!). \nIf you open gnome-terminal before logging out/in, the existing profile settings will simply be recreated (including the error).\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*remove the folder ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal\n\n*log out and back in. You will lose the possible settings changes you made, but you will have your gnome-terminal back.\n\nNote\nfrom the GUI (nautilus) (since the terminal is not available :) )\n~ stands for your home directory.

I just copied suggestion form F1iX.\nThe alternative software is called \"Termi-nator\".\nTo install the software,\n\n*\n\n*leave your graphical user session and switch to a plain terminal with CTRL+ALT+e.g. F3\nOr ssh to the computer remotely (like ssh <user name>@<IP Address> at remote computer)\n\n*Log in and sudo apt-get install terminator\n\n*Switch back to your graphical session with CTRL+ALT+F1 or F2 (or other F-key depending on your setup)\n\n*Launch terminator\n\n*Optional (set as default: sudo apt update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator)\n\nI had numerous issues such as Nvidia graphic card driver and Python version to Terminal malfunction, so instead of fixing and modifying them, I just installed the Termi-nator.\n", "Q: SANE: sane-find-scanner works (now) scanimage and frontend do not Having done what I hope is due diligence in researching this answer I'm stuck.

That includes cd, dvd, swap, mapper and data partitions. Put the nofail option on to every line in /etc/fstab that you think might not be available at any boot time, even apparently otherwise unimportant ones. \nUnfortunately some bad decisions were made with systemd including a lack\nof fault tolerance and a lack of actionable error messages. It's not at\nall clear that the advantages of systemd outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nA: The reason for this error was an entry in /etc/fstab that pointed to partition UUID that was no longer existing (after I reformatted one of the hard drives).\nThe solution was to remove the fstab entry.\nNOTHING AT ALL in the error message indicates what might be the cause of the error, neither does calling journalctl as systemd suggests.\nBrowsing the internet revealed that the exact same error can be produced in several different situations. Take a look at 'starting version 219' bug after the 15.04 update for other causes. Googling for the phrase returns few other possible causes.\nHope it helps anyone who stumbles upon this cryptic error.\n\nA: One of your mount points is failing.

To speed this up, is there any way to set a timeout option with the copy function to allow it to skip corrupted files after a set length of time, forcing it to continue?

It's slow and not nearly raw enough for data-recovery programs to accurately gauge the issue. That's not to say that USB won't work (it might) but a real SATA connection will do you the world of good, as well as being faster.\nGNU's ddrescue (from the gddrescue package) seems to be the best option to make the clone though that's probably subjective and subject to change in time.\nFrom there, you have tools like testdisk, and photorec to untangle broken files and rescue anything that fell through the cracks (eg broken file headers) back to a live filesystem.\n\nNote that data-recovery tools like ddrescue specifically skips over broken bits the first time around. It'll get as good a copy as it possibly can the first time around and iteratively go back for broken data. That sort of answers your \"timeout\" question in itself.\n", "Q: Set resolution for GDM on 15.04 All the current guides on setting the resolution at login are outdated. Most of them suggest using an xrandr command in /etc/gdm/init/default. Problem is, it doesn't seem to work in 15.04 because init.d was replaced with systemd, finally.\nhas anyone figured how to force the resolution at login? My default resolution results in a black screen, so I have to login blind.\n\nA: The secret is monitors.xml, simply copying your user configuration to the root will fix the issue.

And the service wasn't running anyways so it was able to remove the package.\n\nA: From what I can see, people on later versions of Ubuntu (14.10, 15.04) are running into this issue. This is likely due to Ubuntu's move to the systemd init engine (what starts and stops system services).\nThe error you're seeing is the package's pre-removal script trying to interact with the init system and failing spectacularly.\nWe could assume that that's all the script is going to do. You could ignore its failure and use the dpkg --force-all flag to just carry on.\nsudo dpkg -P --force-all avg2013flx\n\nIt's slightly risky if the script does more than that. We could have a look and just edit (and even fix) the pre-removal script:\nsudoedit /var/lib/dpkg/info/avg2013flx.prerm\n\n... But you need to understand what the problem is to fix it. It's undoubtedly something around a line like service stop avg. I don't have it installed (or have a want to install it just for this) so you'll have to fish around (or edit your question to include it and I'll have a look).\n\nThis has come up before on Ubuntu Forums with a fairly trivial fix:\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /etc/init.d/avgd\nsudo apt-get remove --purge avg2013flx\n\nThis just makes sure a fake copy of the init script exists for the removal script, allowing it to complete. Given the other answers suggest just removing the script, my original --force-all suggestion should be just as safe.\n", "Q: Good offline dictionaries for GoldenDict Can someone refer me to some offline dictionaries to use with GoldenDict and how to install/integrate them with it? Preferably English to English dictionaries with large wordbase and phonetic notations for pronunciations, their usage in sentences etc.\n\nA: There is a whole page dedicated to dictionaries on the official website, Getting dictionaries for GoldenDict. I'm not sure if you can get other suggestions here because, as clearly explained on that page, there is a risk of copyright infringements for the non-free dictionaries.\nThe best offline free English to English dictionary I know is WordNet. There is a version of it, specially formatted for GoldenDict, on the download page: search for WordNet, download the .zip file, unzip it somewhere and add that folder as a source for dictionary files.\n\nA: Babylon\nEDIT: Up to the end of 2019, Babylon Software used to offer a large selection of free .bgl dictionaries that work flawlessly with GoldenDict. This was possible due to a loophole in the international intellectual property treaties dealing with databases. Unfortunately, this seems to be no longer the case.\nNonetheless, I have included a web archive link to get an idea of what was available. Perhaps, these can still be found in the deep crevices of the Internet. You would typically be looking for .bgl or .dsl files; most of the times compressed into a .zip file.\nHowever, Babylon Software still sells dictionaries and voice add-ons. Both will work with GoldenDict.\n\nA: Not sure how i found this page, but it has got plenty of popular dictionaries in .bgl format (that can be read by GoldenDict).\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Drive\n\n*download.huzheng.orgdict.org/dict.org/ or just download.huzheng.org\nfrom which you can download dictionaries in StarDict format.\n\nA: English Wiktionary is probably the best choice. You can download it in StarDict/Dictd format in http://www.dictinfo.com/\nYou may also consider Aard Dictionary as an alternative to GoldenDict for content coming from Wikimedia sites.\n\nA: I think nobody mentioned it.\nGet them at your Ubuntu Package Manager!\nThe standard Ubuntu distribution offers some good dictionaries in the dictd format (dict.dz extension), which is compatible with GoldenDict. I list some that I found there:\n\n*\n\n*dict-wn the WordReference English Dictionary\n\n*dict-gcide the Collaborative International Dictionary of English\n\n*dict-moby-thesaurus A large English Thesaurus\n\n*dict-de-en A German-English dictionary\n\nThere are some more, such as  or dict-foldoc or dict-vera\nProcedure:\n\n*\n\n*Open your Package Manager and search for the specific package or just search the word \"dictd\" there you'll see listed the possible packages\n\n\n*Choose and Install the packages\n\n\n*Add the path where the dict.dz files are to the GoldenDict Sources (Edit > Dictionaries > Sources > Files > Add)\nUsually the path is /usr/share/dictd. But if it does not work, search for it yourself:\n\n*\n\n*Update the locate database sudo updatedb\n\n*Search for the extension locate dict.dz\n\nA: I found some must-have GoldenDict files here, here, here (The tarball labelled \"Wikipedia English - Free Encyclopedia\"), and here. :)\nDownload and extract the tarball(s) of your choice.

Ideally I would like to have a new default entry in grub to do so.\nA possible way I found might be to just set an environment variable from grub, and check this later with some script I start like described here: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Autostart But that would not be very quick I think.\n\nA: The link you included with your question explains basic way of creating a startup application for graphical login ( which is exactly what you want ). \nBasically, Ubuntu runs .desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart or ~/.config/autostart for each app that you want to start as soon as you log in.\nGrub's purpose is to boot the OS, not the apps. If you want to speed up the boot of your OS, minimize number of items on graphical startup and number of services that boot in /etc/init. For instance, with ubuntu 14.04 in /etc/init/bluetooth.conf you can safely add # in front of line start on started dbus to prevent it running on startup. \nThe way I'd approach such question, is to research first which services I can safely prevent from starting on boot, make an autologin (to avoid typing password each time), and create a startup entry for your game. \nHere's an example script with the behavior that you've described in the comments. Place this script into your /usr/bin directory, make sure it has executable permissions by running sudo chmod +x scriptname.sh and add this script as a startup application or add manually a .desktop file into your ~/.config/autostart directory.

I also looked here but that didn't solve my problem. I'm stumped on this one. Any suggestions? Is this a duplicate question that I didn't find? Thanks for your help.\nRegards,\nMarshall\n\nA: Well, with the help of a colleague I got it working. There were two main things we did:\n(1) We set the proxy settings in the environment file, rather than apt.conf (so the proxy settings would be set for every application). Also, we did find my proxy settings were set wrong (thanks steeldriver for asking me to double check that). \nhttp_proxy=<correct proxy setting>\nhttps_proxy=<correct proxy setting>\nno_proxy=<internal work website url>\n\nThe no_proxy setting is for my work's own internal website, since we don't use a proxy to access it, so without no_proxy environment variable, I wouldn't be able to access that website.\n(2) I had gone into /etc/sudoers file and added Defaults  for each environment variable after Defaults env_reset (so there were 3 lines that I had added). It turns out that this was broken; instead, we just added the 3 environment variables on the same line as Defaults env_reset with env_keep, like so:\nDefaults env_reset, env_keep+=no_proxy, env_keep+=http_proxy, env_keep+=https_proxy\n\nWith this, these environment variables don't disappear each time I would use sudo. Now I'm up and running just fine.\n", "Q: Wireless conection stops working after app. 30min on RTL8723BE Just at the beginning: I'm a totally noob with Ubuntu.

In my /etc/default/docker I set:\nDOCKER_OPTS=\"-g /srv/docker\"\nSee also my notes here.\nTo change the data directory in lxc I put in /etc/lxc/lxc.conf:\nlxc.lxcpath = /srv/lxc\n\nA: I believe that in this guide you'll have a good explanation.\n\nYou can change Docker's storage base directory (where container and images go) using the -g option when starting the Docker daemon.\nUbuntu/Debian: edit your /etc/default/docker file with the -g option: DOCKER_OPTS=\"-dns 8.8.8.8 -dns 8.8.4.4 -g /mnt\"\nFedora/Centos: edit /etc/sysconfig/docker, and add the -g option in the other_args variable: ex. other_args=\"-g /var/lib/testdir\". If there's more than one option, make sure you enclose them in \" \". After a restart, (service docker restart) Docker should use the new directory.\nUsing a symlink is another method to change image storage.\nCaution - These steps depend on your current /var/lib/docker being an actual directory (not a symlink to another location).\n1) Stop docker: service docker stop. Verify no docker process is running ps faux\n2) Double check docker really isn't running. Take a look at the current docker directory: ls /var/lib/docker/\n2b) Make a backup - tar -zcC /var/lib docker > /mnt/pd0/var_lib_docker-backup-$(date +%s).tar.gz\n3) Move the /var/lib/docker directory to your new partition: mv /var/lib/docker /mnt/pd0/docker\n4) Make a symlink: ln -s /mnt/pd0/docker /var/lib/docker\n5) Take a peek at the directory structure to make sure it looks like it did before the mv: ls /var/lib/docker/ (note the trailing slash to \n6) Start docker back up service docker start\n7) restart your containersresolve the symlink)\n\n\nA: In more recent Docker versions on Ubuntu you will edit /etc/default/daemon.json like so:\n{\n  \"data-root\": \"/new/location\"\n}\n\n\nA: Upgrade to Docker 1.13.0. \nFrom the Release Notes:\n- New\nThe storage location of the Linux volume can now be moved\n\n\nA: After having upvoted the given answers by Stuart and Conrado, I realized it didn't work, and my system partition went full again.\nI actually had to edit the systemd unit file, like described in the following blog article: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-move-docker-s-default-var-lib-docker-to-another-directory-on-ubuntu-debian-linux.\nAll together, here are the steps :\n\n*\n\n*sudo systemctl stop docker docker.socket\n\n*sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/docker.service\n\n*Change the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// into ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -g /new/path/docker -H fd:// and save the file\n\n*sudo mkdir -p /new/path/docker\n\n*sudo rsync -aqxP /var/lib/docker/ /new/path/docker\n\n*sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\n*sudo systemctl start docker\nNow, my system partition remain slim, the /var/lib/docker folder is not re-created.\n\nUpdate following Dan's comment\nAs Dan stated, updating the Docker packages overrides my update and makes Docker using the default path again.\nFollowing his advice, here is how to properly override the default storage path :\n\n*\n\n*sudo systemctl edit docker\n\n*The above command creates an empty file where you need to copy/past the following :\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -g /new/path/docker -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock\n\n\n\n*systemctl status docker.service will ensure all is fine with the override of the Docker configuration\n\n*sudo systemctl restart docker\nNow Docker is using the new place, and you can update the Docker packages without loosing your configuration.\nNote : The reason for the empty ExecStart= is to clear the value from the original file, and the second one fills it again.\n", "Q: How do I hold all updates related to nvidia 346.72 driver?

Exchanging the position of each column with another one:\n\n\nA: You should copy your table and put it into a LibreOffice Calc document.\nThen switch, modify and change the cells.\nAt the end you need to re-transfer your table into the LibreOffice Writer document: select the table, copy it, and use paste special (Ctrl+Shift+V) to put it in the Writer document, according to this question.\n\nA: The solution depends on your exact needs - your question isn't very precise...\nTo mirror a calc sheet horizontally, only affecting the display: enable CTL (complex text layout): Tools -> Options -> Language settings -> Languages -> Default languages for documents -> (enable). Now, the context menu of the sheet tab has an entry \"Sheet Right-to-Left\". This will arrange the complete sheet right-to-left, so the rightmost column is A, left of it is B and so on (found the solution here - written by Lupp on ask.libreoffice.org)\nTo mirror the content: you can't do this using LO Calc. Calc allows only for transposing, e.g. to re-arrange an array so that columns are now rows and vice versa (in your example:\n A | B | C | D\n 1 | 2 | 3 | 4\n\nwould be transformed to\n A | 1\n B | 2\n C | 3\n D | 4\n\nTo workaround: use Gnumeric.

Adding a PPA then running apt-get update to fetch seems to only fetch the latest version from that PPA, but I would like to install a specific version.\nEg: I'm adding the ondrej/php5-5.6 ppa. After an update, apt-cache policy php5 shows me that the available versions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*5.6.9+dfsg-1+deb.sury.org~trusty+2\n\n*5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.9\n\n*5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4\nA few days ago, the latest version from the PPA was 5.6.8+dfsg-1+deb.sury.org~trusty+4, but now it has updated. This means that I can't run an apt-get install and install the particular version I want.\nIs this possible using apt?\n\nA: It seems as though using apt-get install php5=5.6.* to match the version number solves the problem.\nLooking on launchpad, version 4.6.8 no longer exists, only version 4.6.9 exists.\nSimilarly, the ppa:git-core/ppa PPA on launchpad only contains versions 2.4.2 and 2.3.7. It seems as though the latest patch release of each minor version is kept.\nUsing this meaning I can tie the install to a particular minor release, while still receiving patch updates.\n\nA: You can only install the latest version from a PPA, as old versions are deleted when new versions of a package are built and published in a PPA.\n\nA: @Dobey answer seems to be the best solution in your situation. Though if you installed a package from a specific PPA what you can do is to mark that package when it's installed so to keep that version. For example run:\nsudo apt-mark hold packagename\n\n\nA: You can sometimes get old versions, depending on the source. For the most part, when a package is updated, it replaces the previous updated version (some repos keep the first version for that release, until the release goes End Of Life). This also depends on whether newer versions include security updates, or are no longer supported 'upstream' (where the package came from).\nIf the version you want to install is still in the repository, you can use this syntax to install the package:\nsudo apt-get install apache2=2.2.20-1ubuntu1\n\nIf is not available from the repo you are using, you may be able to get the package from elsewhere.\nWith the PPA you seem to be using, you can currently get version 5.6.9. But there is another PPA by the author, from which you can get version 5.5.25.

I have got two operating systems, one of them is Ubuntu 14.04 and the other one is Windows 7. My problem is, the downloading speed of the Ubuntu is much slower than the downloading speed of the my Windows OS. I can download 5 times faster with Internet Download Manager on windows than downloading the same file with FatRat, FlashGot, SteadyFlow, Axel, Uget, and even Wget on Ubuntu. It seems that the Ubuntu downloading speed is too slow. The same thing does NOT hold for loading web pages.\nThe other problem is, whenever I try to download something with ubuntu I get two options, one would be to download the file via one of the external programs that I have installed like Axel which would be gone through it via FlashGot on Firefox. Is not there any way to make the program like Axel or SteadyFlow to popup automatically whenever I click a download link? Just like internet download manager.\n\nA: You need to do more in these applications than IDM, for example in IDM they try to use as many connections as possible (this can actually get you banned from some servers) whereas uGet default is to use 1. Edit your settings for uGet to use more connections for the file you are trying to download.\nAs for the auto-load thing, sure. FlashGot add-on for Firefox can do this.\nFor example set the default option in FlashGot to be uGet and then download something. The popup that asks to complete download also has a check box to remember that setting, check that and the next time it will auto-load uGet.\n\nA: You need to setup repositories from where you can download software in maximum bandwidth.

There are occasional spells of disk activity that go on for 5+ minutes during which the system is unuseable. I cant quite work out which process is responsible but it reminds me of the continual file indexing that used to take place on older versions of windows. Is it possible to change the way 12.04 indexes files in the background so that I can investigate if this is the cause ?\nThanks\nDavid\n\nA: Are there any programs running while this is happening, i.e Firefox, Thunderbird, anything?\nAlso, its possible a cron job could be running in the background?\nYou might try opening a terminal, and using top to watch processes, see if there are any offending processes? \n\nA: I experienced freezes.\nIn my case, I solved them in adjusting the swappiness :\necho vm.swappiness=5 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo sysctl -p\nThe standard swappiness is set @60 (more suitable for servers than desktops), which means the swap can trigger @40% of ram usage.\nWith the setup I use, it starts only @95% of ram usage and in my experience, reduces dramatically freeze occurences.\n", "Q: Django and SQLite3 doesn't work My problem is following, I'm starting with tutorial

What is the good solution for make a secure wallet on ubuntu ?\nIf you have tutorial its good for me :)\nThanks you\n\nA: Is it dangerous to enable OpenSSL?\nNo, not really. Firstly, bitcoin comes with its own OpenSSL library statically linked, so the version you have installed doesn't matter. Secondly, enabling RPC SSL can be a good way of hardening your server.\nThe point that page is trying to make, I think, is that\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabling SSL doesn't remove the need to choose a good RPC password, and\n\n*If the PHP script and the Bitcoin instance are on the same computer, encrypting the link between them doesn't change anything.\n\n\nHow to set up SSL\nAdd this in bitcoin.conf:\nrpcssl=1\nrpcallowip=<server that will issue commands>\n\nHow do I make a secure wallet?\nThat's a really complicated question. I have a couple of broad pieces of advice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run as few services as possible.\n\n*Limit the amount of Bitcoin in your \"hot wallet.\"\n\n*Wherever possible, hold public keys instead of private keys. For example, you can use a client like Electrum which lets the server hold an extended public key instead of an extended private key, which means that you can accept Bitcoin without (the server) being able to spend it.\n\n*Use a service that monitors the addresses in your wallet and alerts you if a lot of them move in a short period of time.\n\n*Enlist the help of a service like BitGo, which would control one of the keys to a multisig account, and act as a second line of defense.\n\n\nPS. This question would probably be best answered over on http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.

This is why the root account is not enabled for log in by default, and all actions which need escalated privileges are performed via usage of sudo.\nYou should not log in and run applications as root. Doing so gives total access to your machine, to the application you are running, and if it so chooses to be malicious, can thus steal or modify any data on your system.\n", "Q: xUbuntu: screensaver settings are missed with two monitor I've installed xUbuntu 14.04 since 2013.

When you run the command with .*, it simply means that match any hidden file in the current directory (stating with .), the current directory itself (.), the parent directory (..). Simply put anything after . (* means 0 or more characters). As a result the parent directory along with all of it child directories get chown-ed to admin:admin.\nLook at this test:\ntest$ ls -al\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 foo foo 4096 Jun  3 07:15 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 foo foo 4096 Jun  2 18:06 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 foo foo 4096 Jun  3 07:15 egg\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 foo foo 4096 Jun  3 07:12 spam\n\n$ sudo chown -R bar:bar spam/.*\n\ntest$ ls -al\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 bar  bar  4096 Jun  3 07:15 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 foo  foo  4096 Jun  2 18:06 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 bar  bar  4096 Jun  3 07:15 egg\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 bar  bar  4096 Jun  3 07:12 spam\n\nTo revert back you need to chown the affected directories again.\nI am not really sure what your plan was, but here are some ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*To chown any directory recursively (including hidden files):\nsudo chown -R foo:foo /spam/egg/\n\n\n*To chown only the files (including hidden files) inside that directory (not the directory itself):\n(shopt -s dotglob && sudo chown -R foo:foo egg/*)\n\n\n*To chown only the non-hidden files (without the directory itself):\nsudo chown -R foo:foo egg/*\n\n\nA: I think it's the \".*\" parameter for files; that matches everything starting with \".\", including the \".\" and the \"..\" files.  The \"..\" is the parent directory, which includes everything under it.\nThe best way is to back up one folder, and specify the actual folder you want to change (/home/admin).\n", "Q: Why don't these packages download?

You can bind this script to a shortcut, such as CtrlAltI\n#!/bin/sh\n# Author : Serg Kolo\n# Date: Wed Jun  3 09:50 2015\n# Description: list available packages graphically\n# using apt-cache search and zenity\n\nFILE=~/.apt-search.txt\nSEARCHTERM=\"$(zenity --entry --text='Enter key to search' )\"\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        apt-cache search \"$SEARCHTERM\" | nl >  $FILE\n        zenity --text-info  --filename=$FILE \nfi\n\n", "Q: Error \"Cannot utime: Operation not supported\" when restoring a tar archive on an android device I replaced the MicroSD card in my mobile (Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini running CyanogenMod 11 with encryption) with a bigger one.\nBefore I pulled the old one out I backed up its content into a tar file:\n/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C016%5D/SD card$ tar czvf ~/tmp/sgm4/sdcard.tar.gz *\nThen replaced the card, formatted the new one and tried to restore my files:\n/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C017%5D/SD card$ tar xzvf ~/tmp/sgm4/sdcard.tar.gz\nThe files got restored but for each one I got an error message like:\n00001.vcf\ntar: 00001.vcf: Cannot utime: Operation not supported\n\nTelling me that tar is unable to restore the original timestamp of the files. This is confirmed by ls -l - it shows the current date and time.\nI normally wouldn't worry about it but there are files under Android/data that belong to applications that might be timestamp sensitive.\nIs there any mount option or other magic that will allow setting the files' timestamps on a mounted mtp filesystem?\nIs the problem related to me using encryption?\nUsing lubuntu 15.04.\nUpdate\nIt turned out that the MicroSD card itself has been formatted using vfat filesystem without any encryption. I pulled it out of the phone, plugged it in another computer (Ubuntu 14.04) and was able to unpack another tarball without any errors. The timestamps of the unpacked files have been restored correctly.\nIt looks like the inability to set the timestamp of a file is something mtp speciffic. Does anyone knows how to overcome that?\n\nA: You get this error when you do not have proper permissions in the target directory, in this case /tmp , or if you are extracting to an non-linux file system (vfat or ntfs).\nExtract or make the archive to a location you own, such as your home directory.\n\nA: In additional to restoring files from an archive, it also attempts to restore timestamp and permissions. As indicated above, some filesystems (perhaps non-Linux, perhaps network drives), do not support a UNIX client setting the timestamp or setting of UNIX permissions. These can result in the following errors from tar:\n\n*\n\n*Cannot utime: Operation not permitted\n\n*Cannot change mode to rwxrwxr-x: Operation not permitted\n\nIf you want to proceed to extract the files anyway and do not care about the original timestamps or permissions, then, you can use these additional options in tar:\n\n-m, --touch\nDon't extract file modified time.\n-no-overwrite-dir\nPreserve metadata of existing directories.\n\nConsult man tar for more info.\n", "Q: Pre-scheduled daily lock-out periods I'm looking for an automatic way to lock out our home computer during certain pre-scheduled times of the day.  Rather than rolling my own script for doing this, is there some off-the-shelf software for this use-case?\nIn case this matters, the solution need not be absolutely bullet-proof.  I just need to raise the \"activation barrier\" just high enough to discourage casual use of the computer.\n\nA: It looks like you can implement this through the standard Linux authentication system (called pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules). This (amongst other things) is responsible for checking if users can log in.\nWithin the pam system, there's a module called pam_time, which allows you to set restrictions for logins based on the time of day. This is controlled by the file /etc/security/time.conf.\nSomething like this could work:\nlogin;tty*;!kjo;Wd1500-2000\n\n- to prevent everyone except the kjo user from logging-in (ie, using the login service, on any tty* terminal) from 3pm to 8pm on weekdays. Be careful though, I haven't tested this!\nThere is quite a bit of documentation about the configuration format in the /etc/security/time.conf file, and check the pam_time and time.conf manual pages for more information:\nman pam_time\nman time.conf\n\nOnce you've configured time.conf to your liking, you'll need to uncomment the following line in your /etc/pam.d/login.conf:\naccount requisite pam_time.so\n\n\nA: One module would be pam_time.  \nYour question may be answered by How do I restrict my kids computing time.\n", "Q: Which program in ubuntu shows network usage at unity panel top-right beside the indicator?

Once it's done, it gives us a checkered background, and then disconnects. What I, personally, can't figure out is why after editing .xsession in the remote user's directory with this:\ngnome-session --session=Ubuntu-2d, it just closes the connection without giving us a session to work in.

Good luck. :)\n\nA: This is a known issue.  When installing xrdp, you will need to specify an alternate desktop to be used while using xrdp.  Unity or Gnome 3 are not working with XRDP and UBuntu 12.10 and later. \nYou have modified you .xsession file and add the command gnome-session --session=Ubuntu-2d.   There is no more ubuntu-2d in Ubuntu since 12.10.  \nSo to have things working, you have to perform the following steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*install xrdp \n\n*install alternate desktop (let say you choose mate-desktop) \n\n*update the .xsession and add mate-session in the file \n\n*try to connect and you should be good to go \n\n\nYou can find detailed instruction here.

This tool scans files with 56 different virus scanners and reports back on whether any of them found any viruses.\nIn this case the vast majority (54) found nothing to be concerned about while two identified a virus.  It's up to you to decide how much you trust those two particular virus scanners to be accurate and not to display false positives, which can occasionally happen.\nYou also need to decide whether you want to trust that service (virustotal) itself.\nIf you look in the second tab it does say that this is a signed file with verified signature, so the tool itself is saying it is a legitimate file from Canonical UK Ltd and has not been tampered with.  So, if you can trust Canonical not to put viruses into files that lends additional weight to this being a false positive on the part of those 2 out of 56 virus scanners.\n", "Q: How should Juju conect to MaaS nodes with two networks? I am sure this has been asked and answered before but I've looked around and don't see it.   \nI have a MaaS cluster with two deployable nodes.   In addition to the ILO IPMI interface, each box has two network interfaces.   I can PXE boot to either one and register the nodes into ready state, and \"acquire\" them from the cluster controller GUI.  \nHowever, when I try to bootstrap Juju, it can never connect to my just-deployed node.  \njuju bootstrap --to=North.maas \nBootstrapping environment \"maas\"\nStarting new instance for initial state server\nLaunching instance\n   - /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-445132b0-08c0-11e5-b473-001b24b3b2f4/\nInstalling Juju agent on bootstrap instance\nWaiting for address\nAttempting to connect to North.maas:22\nAttempting to connect to North.maas:22\nAttempting to connect to 192.168.137.105:22\n\nThe reason it hangs is that the 192.168.137.0/24 network is the managed network for the MaaS cluster controller.  It is not routable to the network that is running JuJu (192.168.1.0/24).   The node that is deployed doesn't seem to launch the non-MaaS network either - the one that goes to the JuJu control node.   I have tried swapping eth0 and eth1 for the two networks and the end result is the same.   \nWhat am I missing?   \nUPDATE 3 June 2015 \nOnce the node is deployed from the bootstrap, I can ssh to the node from the cluster controller, and manually edit /etc/network/interfaces, bring up eth0 with DHCP managed by my router, delete the existing default route to the MaaS network, and add a new default route to the main network - and I have bidirectional access - from the node to the internet, and from my JuJu host to the IP address on the eth0 network that it got from my router.   It's really unclear to me why this wasn't configured by MaaS as the node was brought up.   \n16:41 I have verified that if I bring up eth0 manually with dhcp in /etc/network/interfaces:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0                               # <--- added\niface eth0 inet dhcp                    # <--- added\n\n# Primary interface (defining the default route)\niface eth1 inet manual\n\n# Bridge to use for LXC/KVM containers\nauto juju-br0\niface juju-br0 inet dhcp\n    bridge_ports eth1\n\nthen restart the avahi-daemon, then the JuJu node (a mac) can get to the North node with\nssh ubuntu@North.local\n\nThe hostname is simply \"North\", which is why this works.   North.maas isn't going to work, even if MaaS/Juju had configured eth0.   The /etc/hosts file has in it:\n127.0.1.1       North.maas      North\n\nI have to be missing something fundamental in node naming and network settings on MaaS. \n\nA: This  is only a partial answer.   I noticed the following message under the Fully Qualified Domain Name dialog box for the nodes:\n\nThe FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is derived from the host name: If the cluster controller for this node is managing DNS then the domain part in the host name (if any) is replaced by the domain defined on the cluster; if the cluster controller does not manage DNS, then the host name as entered will be the FQDN.\n\nI entered North.local here and turned off DNS for the managed network x.x.137.0.   The bootstrap still didn't bring up eth0, but when I did that manually the JuJu bootstrap continued.   \nSo the remaining mystery is why didn't MaaS configure the interface.   \n", "Q: \"Unable to connect to Upstart\" error when installing git-all I am using 15.04. \nSo I'm working with git and I installed the standard version.

If you look at the package properties in Synaptic, you will find that git-all depends on either git-daemon-run or git-daemon-sysvinit. git-daemon-run is the one that gets installed by default for some reason, even though it's broken in Ubuntu 15.04 and up. (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runit/+bug/1448164) But if you install git-daemon-sysvinit manually first, then git-all's dependency will be satisfied, by a package that actually works. You can then install git-all, and everything should be fine.\n\nA: You'll need to forcibly remove runit. Running sudo dpkg -r runit should work. You might need to use one of the --force-* options.\n\nA: You are probably using Ubuntu under a virtual host. If so, you will need to modify initctl to return true using the following steps. First, you need to tell dpkg, that you are going to change the upstart package installation using:\nsudo dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl\n\nThen, you need to create a dummy initctl as a link to true:\nln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl\n\n", "Q: Chromium Won't Play Youtube Videos Past the Ads I use Ubuntu 14.04, and I installed Chromium from the software center.My problem is on YouTube, when an ad plays that i cannot skip, once the ad is over it just freezes on the last frame of said ad.

Most probably it's an icon or link created by yourself and upon editing it's properties you can remove the flag to make it work so that desktop icons don't disappear anymore.    \n\nA: try this command\ngsettings set org.gnome.gnome-flashback.desktop show-icons true\n\n", "Q: is there a conky companion that allows me to read rss feed? Everything is in the title. just adding more characters to reach the 30 characters mark.\nI could not find one. There was conkygooglereader but the Google service has ceased.\n\nA: conky indeed is used for system monitoring such as CPU, HDD, system messages , etc... So I don't think you could find a rss reader.\nInstead you can use a similar approach called screenlets.\n\ncreenlets are small owner-drawn applications (written in Python) that\n  can be described as \"the virtual representation of things\n  lying/standing around on your desk\". Sticky notes, clocks, rulers, ...\n  the possibilities are endless.\n\nYou can find multiple kings and types from http://gnome-look.org/?xcontentmode=6700.\nNow back to what you want. First add the screenlets repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:screenlets/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow you can install a rss reader called feedreader-screenlet\nsudo apt-get install feedreader-screenlet\n\n", "Q: Taking a screenshot of current user's session (Forgive me if my terminology is not quite accurate here)\nI have a cron job set up that uses scrot to take screenshots of my desktop at various intervals. \nHowever, when I switch user to another account (without logging off) the screenshots that come back are just shots of the lock screen. \nIs there anyway for me to get a screenshot of the current user's session? I.e, what is actually on the screen?\n\nA: As far as X11 is concerned, when you switch to another user, that user is on a completely different display. \nIn you session, if you execute:\necho $DISPLAY\n\nyou will have :0, the first virtual display. In the second user, the same will give you :1, the second display. \nYou can see the screens in use with the command w:\n[romano:~] % w  \n 11:32:03 up  1:05,  8 users,  load average: 0,10, 0,24, 0,30\nUSER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT\nromano   :0       :0               10:27   ?xdm?   6:25   0.13s gdm-session-wor\nromano   pts/1    :0               11:03   26:49   0.10s  0.10s zsh\nromano   pts/3    :0               11:21    0.00s  0.12s  0.01s w\ndefault  :1       :1               11:24   ?xdm?   6:25   0.07s gdm-session-wor\ndefault  pts/15   :1               11:24    1:56   0.05s  0.05s bash\n\nTo be able to do a screenshot from one screen of the other, or from another user, the user to be \"shotted\" must issue the command \nxhost + \n\nto enable access (not even root will be able to do the snapshot otherwise). After that, you can do a \nDISPLAY=:1 scrot \n\nfrom a script or another user. Notice that if you shot a screen which is not active (displayed) you will have a black screen or strange things --- who knows what's in the video buffer memory... \nNow it's up to you to write a script exploring all this... you should in principle detect which user is active (not easy --- or simply shot all of the screen and discard the black ones after) and do the screenshot.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You need to store the screenshots in publicly viewable areas, and also the xserver locks the screen on user switching (not a demonstrated fact, but a reasonable assumption). You probably need to set up an xserver to display this to a file in the home directory, so that when the cron job is called, you fire up the xserver to render the screen to file, rather than for the display.\n\nA: When you switch to other user then you are opening a new session for the new user, and the old session for first user is just on the login. This is a normal attitude of cron, cron is associated to first user so it will just work with his session only.\nI hope you understand what I mean. I'm not that good in English anyway, to make it works for the other user, you have to create the same cron for the second user, so that you can take the shots for every user.\n", "Q: How to set Font size in Ubuntu 15.04?

Note that I was able to confirm server was working (displays apache welcome when entering url/ip) and able to both install and config my wordpress (updating welcome page themes etc) however when entering the IP/URL I still saw my apache welcome page. As both the server and wordpress were working in isolation, I established my server was not pointing to my desired wordpress page. \nNote that I am using Apache as web server. The site (homepage) is served from a file in the server directory. So we need to amend configurations explained below.  \nFrom root user you can try this  cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled\nNow if you do ls, this should confirm what file you have within this directory.\nHopefully a file such as 000-default.conf. Now we need to get into this file to amend the configure the \"pointer\". Now sudo nano 000-default.conf\nUpon pressing enter, it should pop up with a config file, code starting with  etc. \nNotice in black writting it has 2 lines of code, server admin which we leave as \"webmaster@localhost\". But the 2nd line is the root of our fix. \nWe need to amend this which tells the server the source of the content being requested when entering/landing the home page.\n(There has been an update to raspian jessie whereby there is now an added line of code causing issues with people following other online tutorials/videos using an older version). \nChange document root, which in my case was from /var/www/html to /var/www/html/index.html then Ctrl X, press y, and enter.\nReload website homepage and you should see the wordpress page!\nNote that methods will vary and my explanation is on the basis all other config has been completed correctly i.e. database linked to wordpress etc.\nMy setup involved a Raspberry pi 3, Apache server, PHP V 7.1, mySQL Mariadb and of course Wordpress latest version as March 2020.\n", "Q: How could we connect ODBC to ubuntu 14.04 Is there any way to connect to a MS ODBC system to the linux os.

I believe this is what caused some texts to display in serif fonts, the best examples are the tab titles in Google Chrome and the texts in dialogs such as for opening files. While this did not break anything, it does look ugly. \nEDIT: I've noticed that also browser drop-down menus have disappeared, I suspect it is due to the same incorrect setting.\nMy Fonts in System Settins read Oxygen-Sans for all but fixed width fonts, which is set to Oxygen Mono. These are sans serif fonts. Also my kdeglobals file reads:\n...\n[General]\nBrowserApplication=google-chrome.desktop\nColorScheme=Breeze\nName=Breeze\nfont=Oxygen-Sans,10,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0\nmenuFont=Oxygen-Sans,10,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0\nshadeSortColumn=true\nsmallestReadableFont=Oxygen-Sans,8,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0\ntoolBarFont=Oxygen-Sans,9,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0\nwidgetStyle=breeze\n...\n\nDoes anyone know where I can change this font used in the examples above back to its default? Could this be caused by something different than the settings I've been looking at?\nI'm not sure if this is important, but I did add the Kubuntu backports ppa. \n\nA: Finally, I found the misplaced setting. I'll put it here in case someone somehow has the same issue.\nThe setting that had changed and caused some texts in applications, especially the 'open file' and 'save file' dialogues to change, sits in System Settings > Application Style > GNOME Application Style (GTK) > GTK Themes > Font. This suggests that the applications having troubles are GTK applications.\nAnyway, putting the Font back to Oxygen-Sans 10 restored the normal look and feel of the applications. \n", "Q: xrdp desktop environment comparison I know that this question might tend to somehow opinion based answers but I think it is very helpful anyways.\nI am using xrdp to my Ubuntu Computer (from Windows and Linux). I have figured out that every Desktop Environment has some \"bugs\". E.g. with xfce, TAB is not working properly, or Gnome has some Problems too.\nMy question now is if someone has a comparison based on actual facts between Gnome, xfce and KDE (and also others) with using xrdp.\n\nA: In fact you can't and this is unfair to make a comparison or whatever decision using xrdp.\nIndeed xrdp is just an open source implementation of the Microsoft RDP protocol, and frankly it's still not mature enough to be stable.\nMoreover, every Desktop Environment has its own problem with xrdp, even unity.\nProblems range from keyboard layout differences , no window decoration, no language switching, no top panel in Unity and many other problems.\nSo in couple of words, to have a fair and logical comparison you should work on a physical system running those environments.\nPersonally, I have more than 4 years of experience using xrdp and other protocols and for bad till now, it doesn't get stable in some way. \nPS: I advise you to take a look at X11RDP\n", "Q: ubuntu on power5 ibm p5 9110 510 I want to install Ubuntu on my ibm p5 9110 510 but from manuals i found that  only aix,suse linux,and redhat linux can be installed on that machine.\ncan any one provide help how to install ubuntu \n\nA: IBM support for Ubuntu actually started with IBM Power8 and officially is only support on power8 and future power systems.

To understand it take the image you want to crop. Now, imagine that on the image, you are drawing a rectangle of the size which you want to retain. The area outside this rectangle will be eliminated, cropped. The rectangle must not be tilted i.e. the top side must be horizontal. \nNow, note down these 4 things: \n\n\n*\n\n*the width (W) in pixel of the rectangle\n\n*height (H) of the rectangle\n\n*distance of the left vertical side of the rectangle from the left margin/end (L) of the image\n\n*distance of the top side of the rectangle from the top margin/end of the image (T).  \n\n\nThus you have now W, H, L and T values. So far so good. To know the pixels, you may install krule tool in Ubuntu. Very useful.\nNow, open the terminal and go to the folder where the image is stored. Use the following command and put the values of W, H, L and T properly:\nconvert input.jpg -crop WxH+L+T output.jpg\n\n\nA: Use mogrify -crop <W>x<H>+<X>+<Y> <files>.\nCareful: the files are overwritten without notice. Add the -path option to specify an output directory to prevent this if required.\nAs an example: mogrify -crop 256x256+10+5 images/*.jpg will crop each image in the images folder to a 256x256 image by starting 10 pixels from the top and 5 pixels from the side. It will overwrite the old images.\nIf you get a Argument list too long error due to trying to convert many images at once, simply wrap your image path in single quotes to prevent bash from expanding it: mogrify -crop 256x256+10+5 'images/*.jpg' (mogrify will do the expansion itself)\n\nA: If you want to trim white regions away, imagemagick has a special command for it:\nconvert -trim input.jpg output.jpg\n\n\nA: You can use convert command in image magick pack.\nTo install sudo apt-get install imagemagick or sudo yum install ImageMagick.\nThen use -crop geometry to crop the image.

Installing desktop specific packages may break the configuration of your phone (similar to how non-desktop packages can break your desktop installation). You also shouldn't use apt-get on the phone unless you are fully aware of the consequences, which the average desktop user typically is not.\nFrom a developer perspective you would just flash a working image from the image server to an unlocked phone. However for a normal consumer there isn't always an option to buy an unlocked or unlockable phone (fastboot oem unlock is specific to Google's Nexus devices). So you can't correct mistakes like above yourself and the device manufacturers customer service may charge you and require to send your device in for servicing.\nRegarding apt-get being unavailable on recovery, this is probably how it is supposed to be. apt-get is not a vital part of the Android or Ubuntu Phone/Snappy infrastructure, so it shouldn't be surprising that it isn't included in the recovery image, which is different from the recovery mode on the desktop. \nRemember that you are on the phone and you get updates through OTA images or the store. You also shouldn't use apt-get, since you would need to reinstall and configure all packages again after an OTA update, this is how the phone works: apt-get is available but not guaranteed to work like on the desktop. I also doubt that the store offered you this package for installation.\nOne thing you could try is to the read the system logs if these are available from the recovery or even do exist and try to find out what keeps the phone from properly booting up (probably a confusing desktop configuration that can be replaced by a more mobile friendly one). If you can modify the system you can poke around and compare the state of your device with contents from the OTA or factory image. The goal is to get the phone booting again and have it flash the next OTA update when it is released that may return the device into a pristine condition, though there is no guarantee for that because OTAs are differential updates not complete system images.\n", "Q: Genius Mousepen i608x I am a simple user of ubuntu.

After seeing this and this, and also adding numerous PPA's that have no logical reason to be added, I still can't get to have gnome-shell further than 3.12.2.\nI am using Ubuntu GNOME LTS and I am fetching from the GNOME Project PPA\n\nA: A strict answer to you question \"Why?\" is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because the maintainers of the repositories decided to not port it to 14.04, as you can see when filtering the versions of Ubuntu (gnome3, gnome3-staging).\n\n\nProbably you also wanted to know whether there is an easy way to install it. The answer is no. Why?\n\n\n*\n\n*Because apparently it is not compatible with Trusty, too unstable on it and no one have yet it officially ported.\nYou can try to compile and install it by following the official Gnome compile guide.\n\n\nFinally, I just want to point out that your behaviour is contradictory. One uses LTSs because wants stable software (although maybe older). If you want to use new (maybe-not-so-stable-on-Ubuntu) software, you should move to the latest Ubuntu version or, even better, change distro and go for a rolling distro.\nInstalling the latest software (via PPAs or just by installing the debs) on a possibly older LTS release will make it more unstable than the last non-LTS.\n", "Q: Unable to install latest brackets on Ubuntu 15.04 I have latest deb package of brackets 64bit.

It\n  was invented by Richard Stallman and Bob Chassell many years ago,\n  loosely based on Brian Reid's Scribe and other formatting languages of\n  the time. It is used by many non-GNU projects as well.\n       Texinfo uses a single source file to produce output in a number of formats, both online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml, etc.).\n  This means that instead of writing different documents for online\n  information and another for a printed manual, you need write only one\n  document. And when the work is revised, you need revise only that one\n  document. The Texinfo system is well-integrated with GNU Emacs.\n\nTo learn how to use texinfo read http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Texinfo\nReading some emacs WIKI:\n\nThis page is about Info mode (‘C-h i’), a major mode for reading\n  hypertext manuals. In particular, the EmacsManual is available in\n  Emacs as an Info manual, providing SelfDocumentation.\n\nQuoted from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsManual:\n\nEmacs comes with a comprehensive manual. Access it through Info,\n  either with the info command in a shell window under GNU and Unix\n  operating systems, or in Emacs, by typing ‘M-x info RET’ (that’s Meta-\n  or ESC x, the word “info”, followed by the return key), or by typing\n  ‘C-h i’ (that’s Control-h followed by i). Starting with Emacs 22, you\n  can also read the manual with ‘C-h r’.\n\nAs a conclusion info pages use Textinfo documentation format but as said in the GNU Textinfo wiki The Texinfo system is well-integrated with GNU Emacs.\n", "Q: How to debug a process developed in C running as a Wi-Fi Access Point?

It is now owned by root and cannot be read - But it's needed for a successful login, as you might have noticed. Now you know, but nonetheless: Don't run startx with root permissions!\nTo fix the permissions, we need to access a command line without X Server. But that's no problem.

You need to put in your username, press Enter and put in your password. \nIf you are not sure about your username (as there is a \"display name\" visible most of the time, if you defined one), switch back to the graphical login via Ctrl+Alt+F7 and log in as guest. Take a look at the /home directory via your file manager - There is a directory named the same as your username. \nGo back to your terminal login prompt, type in your username and your password. I cannot help you with figuring out your password, but I hope you remember it. Be sure your keyboard layout is correctly configured (for example while being asked for your username).\nNow, we'll fix permissions. It's pretty straightforward, just run\nsudo chown -R $(id -u -n):$(uid -u -n) /home/$(id -u -n)\n\n$(id -u -n) will be replaced with your username when the command is running.

I am non-tech entrepreneur. I have developed a Rails app. I want to deploy it live. Can anyone guide me on how to use Ubuntu server + Juju on my laptop to deploy the app live on internet.\n\nA: Using Juju to Deploy Your Rails Application is a great place to start. That documents what you need to do to deploy a rails application with Juju.\nFor development purposes, the Juju Vagrant Workflow for OS X will get you up and running with a Vagrant virtual machine in order to fully experience Juju using the local provider. This is how I do most of my development work.\nWhen you're ready to put your application live, you would then use your own private cloud or a public one such as Amazon.\nFor example, I'd write a yaml file to tell the Rails charm about my rail application. Next, I'd fire up a Vagrant virtual machine, which will start me with a fully functional local environment to test with. I'd deploy rails, passing it the yaml file I created, and then test to verify that my application works as expected.\nAt that point, I'd shut down the vm, returning to my OS X terminal, and juju switch amazon, juju bootstrap the environment, and then deploy the application.\nThat's all a bit high level, but should point you in the right direction.\n", "Q: Remap Fn+F3 from XF86Sleep to XF86MonBrightnessUp I have got a new laptop which is Toshiba Sattelite Pro R50 and I've installed Linux Mint 17.1 on it. After a while it turned out brightness buttons are mapped incorrectly.\nFn + F3 is mapped to XF86Sleep\nFn + F2 is mapped to XF86Battery\nThe keys should be mapped to XF86MonBrightnessUp and XF86MonBrightnessDown respectively.\nI've not found any working solution for this issue. \nThere's one using xbingkeys that allows me to bind XF86Battery to a script, but it still doesn't work for XF86Sleep.\n.xbindkeysrc file below. The /usr/bin/caja it's just for testing purposes.\n# brightness down\n\"/usr/bin/caja\"\n    m:0x0 + c:244\n    XF86Battery\n\n# brightness up\n\"/usr/bin/caja\"\n    m:0x0 + c:150\n    XF86Sleep\n\nI'm looking for a solution to rebind keys to brightness down/up keys or at least run custom script when the combination is pressed. Currently Fn + F3 puts the computer into sleep mode which is very annoying.\n\nA: Take a look at xmodmap.\nIf you want to have the changes you did with it persist, create a script in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d and just add all the xmodmap commands you executed before, each on its own line, into it.  The existing scripts there seem to be bash scripts, so start with the line\n#!/bin/bash\n\nYou will need root permissions to create that file, read about that in your favorite linux wiki if you aren't familiar with it. If you created the script, you'll still have to make it executable with chmod +x /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME.sh – for more details, again, go to your favorite linux wiki.\n", "Q: Systemd tries to mount encfs at startup I have a problem with systemd trying to mount my encfs drive /dev/sdb1.\nSystemd asks for the password to encrypt the drive. This is only a problem when I'm updating Ubuntu, because the installation often halts while systemd is asking for the password. After aborting the password question, the installation continues but this is very annoying...\nI don't want systemd to handle my encfs drive at all, I only mount it when I need it and this is done with the file manager, not through systemd.

After lots of research I found something that suggested that combined WPA/WPA2 mode on the router that generated the wireless access point could be problematic.  I reset the parameters in the router to force it use WPA.  As suggested, I used AES (NOT TKIP).  I did this several days ago and have had no problem since.\nToday's updates included an update to the DHCP client and I have not investigated to see whether this could correct the original problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue after installing kubuntu 15.04 on x230.

This raises some security concerns so this is only for the brave...\nUpdate :\nIn my case the problem was that kwalletmanager stopped working so I had to re install it.

You might be exceeding the \"max\" amount. Example of this:\ninnodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend:max:512M\nYou can up the 512 or remove the :max:512m totally for it to be \"limitless\".\n\n*You are adding an INDEX to a MEMORY table (obviously not the case but worth mentioning).\n\n\n\nRegarding NDB Cluster:\n\n\n*An NDB engine holds all data in RAM. From the link:\n\nIn MySQL 5.0, Cluster is in-memory only. This means that all table data (including indexes) is stored in RAM. Therefore, if your data takes up 1 GB of space and you want to replicate it once in the cluster, you need 2 GB of memory to do so (1 GB per replica). This is in addition to the memory required by the operating system and any applications running on the cluster computers\n\nIf this is the cause you can do this but it will be a perfomance hit.\n\n*Check the values of MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations and MaxNoOfConcurrentTransactions. Set them to a value higher than the largest table in the cluster.\n\n*Check the log file for related messages (ndb_2_trace.log?). If it shows things like \"Node 2: Data usage increased to 100%\" you are running out of memory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Index memory stores primary key indexes ONLY.\n\n*Data memory stores all the data + other indexes.\n\n*The memory you need per table is something like this: \n((size of a table) + (size of index)) * ( the number of records) \n\n*IndexMemory and DataMemory are the corresponding settings. If you exceed these you get this error.\n\n\n*The maximum number of attributes (columns and indexes) per table is limited to 128. \n", "Q: More emoji system wide (especially on empathy) I wanted a familiar set of emoji for the Empathy interface (I currently only use empathy for hangouts).

Aborting.\nSee ATLAS/INSTALL.txt for further information\n\nCan someone help me take a look?\n\nA: I am a fairly recent Ubuntu user and not a computer expert and I was having exactly the same problem as you. After some struggling, I managed to avoid the message \"CPU Throttling apparently enabled!\" and got ATLAS 3.10.2 installed.\nThe first tip I got in https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/859/#f11d, where it basically says that \"The only time ATLAS should detect throttling that isn't occurring is when the processors are fixed to run at a lower speed than their maximum speed.\" My processor was not running at its maximum speed, since I had a BIOS speed limit. \nIf you have the same problem, look at the maximum frequency allowed in the file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq.  Copy this value to the files for each processor(/cpu/cpu1, /cpu/cpu2 etc). You need to do it as super-user, but before it takes effect, you have to edit the file /sys/module/processor/parameters/ignore_ppc from 0 to 1. More details are given here.\nThis was still not enough for me and I figured out that I had to edit the files /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq to the same value that was used before. After that, I did not get the boring message any more and ATLAS was successfully installed!\nupdate: I have just gone through this process again and it seems that the real problem is to have the power scaling driver intel p_state enabled.

In addition to what Filipe wrote, I had to disable ACPI in GRUB, which was the root of the throttling issue (link). I disabled Intel pstate too, since both were installed.

Here was my process (follow at your own risk):\nnano /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text acpi=off intel_pstate=disable\"\nsave\nupdate-grub\nreboot\n\nThe scaling drivers should now be absent, which you can test with this command:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_driver\n\nKeep in mind that this turns off power and temperature management systems.

That's why it works when I use the command line, but not when using network-manager. Rather the nameserver 127.0.1.1 [dnsmasq] is added and that nameserver is told the IP addresses of the actual nameservers.\n\nThe big advantage is that if you connect to a VPN, instead of having all your DNS traffic be routed through the VPN like in the past, you’ll instead only send DNS queries related to the subnet and domains announced by that VPN.\n\nUpdate\nDisabling dnsmasq as explained in link above solves the issue because /etc/resolv.conf is populated.\nThis is not a real solution though, it's a fallback.\n\nA: Check if there is a mismatch between the host you are trying to resolve via the VPN and the \"DNS Domain\" that the Cisco VPN server is sending.\nTo check for this, open a terminal and run:\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\nThen start openconnect via network manager.  You'll see a whole bunch of output come through, including some lines like this:\n\nDec  5 12:54:31 canoe NetworkManager[1266]:    Internal DNS:  10.0.20.21\nDec  5 12:54:31 canoe NetworkManager[1266]:    Internal DNS: 10.10.3.32\nDec  5 12:54:31 canoe NetworkManager[1266]:    DNS Domain: 'internal.example.com'\n\nAnd further down you'll see\n\nDec  5 12:54:31 canoe dnsmasq[1871]: using nameserver 10.0.20.21#53 for domain internal.example.com\n\nThis means that the VPN server is instructing the client that the DNS servers should be used to resolve hosts within internal.example.com, such as server.internal.example.com.\nIn my case, I need to resolve server.example.com (and was not getting any result).\nThe solution for me was to go into the VPN settings and add example.com as an additional search domain:\n\nDon't forget to disconnect VPN and then re-connect for the setting to take effect.\n\nA: So I have resolved this for myself satisfactorily enough. I am on Mint 18 / Ubuntu 16.04\nMy problem was that once I connected to the Openconnect VPN through NetworkManager I could no longer resolve DNS for domains outside of my work domains. I.e. I lost internet!\nMy fix was this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In NetworkManager, I edited the VPN Connection under \"Network Connections\".\n\n*In the IPv4 tab, changed method to \"Automatic (VPN) Addresses Only\"\n\n*Added my work DNS server (e.g. 10.10.10.100) and \"Search domain\" of \"mywork.tld\"\n\n*Click on \"Routes\".\n\n*Add a route that covers my work network, e.g. 10.10.0.0 / 255.255.0.0 and gateway of 10.10.10.253 <-- VPN gateway I got from a \"traceroute\".\n\n*Then I ticked both options:\ni. \"Ignore automatically optained routes\"\nii. \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\"\n\n\nWorks on my computer. \nMy understanding of what happened is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*My /etc/resolv.conf is setup with dnsmasq and is pointing to 127.0.1.1\n\n*dnsmasq is using my ISP's DNS servers for general internet DNS resolution. For example, ISP DNS is let's say 8.8.8.8.\n\n*I connect to VPN, DNS server of 10.10.10.100 is added as an additional server to dnsmasq to be used for \"mywork.tld\" DNS resolution.\n\n*Once I am on the VPN, my work firewall no longer allows me to use port 53 to 8.8.8.8 so my general internet resolution goes away. DNS should timeout and go to the secondary DNS server, but it doesn't for some reason?\n\n*I am left only with access to DNS resolution for \"server01.mywork.tld\" because this query goes to 10.10.10.100 which I have access to over the VPN.\n\n*If I query for www.google.com it fails, even though my internal DNS can forward. I can only assume that my internal DNS is never asked.\n\n\nMy fix seems to stay working so long as my work doesn't change their network or DNS server IP address.\nI'm a bit hazy about it, but I think it works for me because once this is done my Wireless NIC becomes my default network connection. So DNS queries go to 8.8.8.8 over wifi. Any query for \"xyz.mywork.tld\" is told by dnsmasq to go to 10.10.10.100. I have set a route for that, so that goes over \"vpn0\" NIC which returns the correct 10.10.10.x IP address for \"xyz.mywork.tld\". Bingo bango DNS resolution for internal and external networks and everyone is happy. \n", "Q: Kinesis Advantage keyboard keeps cutting out on a new Dell Optiplex 9020 I just started using a Dell Optiplex 9020.  I noticed that my Kinesis Advantage keyboard will stop working every 10 minutes or so.  Simply unplugging it then plugging it back in fixes the problem but this is incredibly disruptive.  I have tried different ports, front, back, and the monitor hub (trying both the ports marked with SS and those without) but nothing seems to make a difference.  This does not happen with the Dell keyboard that came with the computer so I wonder if this keyboard wants more power and the computer stops providing it after a while.  I have used this keyboard without any problems on 3 other computers so I know it is a good keyboard.  Any ideas?\nI saw Dell offers a driver (published a year ago) for Ubuntu 12.04 which I may try despite the difference in revisions, I am using 14.04.  It seems strange as this seems very Windows-ish to me to install a manufacturer driver.\n\nA: The problem was an obscure bug specific to Kinesis Advantage keyboards.  Kinesis tech support said others had similar behavior using Ubuntu when using programmable macros.  It is not clear why but for some hardware, when using a macro, the keyboard gets shutoff (no usb power).  \nI resolved the issue by deleting a macro I had set inadvertently (it was not actually set to do anything which is why it took so long to figure out what was happening).\n\nA: The problem I had was the aggressive power management my laptop was doing, to work around it I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*lsusb to find the device id \n\n*search for AUTOSUSPEND_USBID_BLACKLIST in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/usb-autosuspend.conf and add the device id in there.\n\n", "Q: Can not login in Ubuntu I have a problem with the login to my user account on Ubuntu.

I have done pre-press (for too many years) albeit on Macs/MS-Coreldraw using the same techniques, but a few years ago moved over completely to Ubuntu for all my computing needs; now needing some new business cards, stumbled on this error and cannot work out why it's occurring. The design is simply text with a single QR graphic on it and that works fine, except for the Futura BdCn BT not formatting correctly and coming out more 'fat' and bold as opposed to the slim Futura BdCn BT style.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.10 with the 0.48 Inkscape install, but prior to next trying an Inkscape upgrade, has anyone experienced this issue and how do you overcome it? Failing that, anyone have a solution for the pre-press PDF requirement.\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: I've noted the same behavior when bolding an already bold font. Appearance in Inkscape and the SVG is unchanged whether or not bold is on, but the PDF has the appearance of being bolded twice when bold is on. So, the fix is to make sure that bold is turned off for such fonts, even though it doesn't appear to make any difference within Inkscape. \nI get the same behavior in 0.48.4 on Linux, as well as 0.48.5 on OS X.\n\nA: Get the GIMP. I had to make a poster for the fraternity in a pdf format of all things, and I know that you can just transfer image formats through GIMP.\n\nA: Sounds like an issue embedding the fonts. As this is just for printing the text doesn't need to be recognised as text in the pdf.\nWhen you select save and choose pdf a window should appear with some options. Select the convert texts to paths option. This should hopefully just render the text exactly as you see it in inkscape into an image in the pdf.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer for Dell laptops?

I had to reinstall ubuntu from scratch to resolve this. However, I used to back up data regularly via deja dup. Is it possible to restore my lost data somehow?\n\nA: It is not possible unless you backed up your data to an external drive or cloud service. You need the files stored in the deja-dup folder to restore. I recommend installing Dropbox and changing your backup folder location to be inside your Dropbox folder so you can restore. \n", "Q: Set system clock to local sidereal time (the time needed for astronomy) Basically if you don't already know, the world is round, so we have timezones as an agreement.

Is there a package or script to set the system time based off of LST for current coordinates, rather than something more general, like a time zone?\n\nA: What you seem to be looking for is called \"Apparent solar time\" and will not be part of the OS. You may be able to use a Search Engine to locate an application or algorithm that will help you calculate this based on GPS coordinate.\nI did a quick check on Google and saw that the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration has a web page at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/ that may help you with this.\n\nA: What you search is the  LST (Local Solar Time) or local sideral time, and you can use an online page to see it. \n\nAs the OP found, there is the sunclock application which you can install with \nsudo apt-get install sunclock\n\nRun it (sunclock from the command line) and after you have resized the normally tiny window, you can switch from \"map\" mode to a \"clock\" mode by hitting !

I would prefer terdons answer in your place.\n\nYou can use the command file to to determine the file type:\n% file 20050101_14-24-37_330.jpg \n20050101_14-24-37_330.jpg: JPEG image data, EXIF standard 2.2, baseline, precision 8, 1200x1600, frames 3\n\n% file test.jpg\ntest.jpg: PNG image data, 1192 x 774, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced\n\nWith this information, the files can be renamed:\nPlease do a test before you apply the command to your images\nfind . -type f -iname \"*.jpg\" -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} file -F\"<separator>\" {} | \n awk -F \" image data\" '{print $1}' | \n  awk -F\"<separator> \" '{\n   system(\"mv \\\"\"$1\"\\\" $(dirname \\\"\"$1\"\\\")/$(basename -s .jpg \\\"\" $1 \"\\\").\"$2)\n   }'\n\n\nExample\n% find . -type f -name \"*.jpg\"\n./test.jpg\n./sub/20050101_14-24-37_330.jpg\n\n% find . -type f -iname \"*.jpg\" -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} file -F\"<separator>\" {} | awk -F \" image data\" '{print $1}' | awk -F\"<separator> \" '{system (\"mv \\\"\"$1\"\\\" $(dirname \\\"\"$1\"\\\")/$(basename -s .jpg \\\"\" $1 \"\\\").\"$2)}'\n\n% find . -type f -iname \"*\"    \n./test.PNG\n./sub/20050101_14-24-37_330.JPEG\n\n\nA: You can do it relatively easily in bash:\nfor f in *jpg; do \n    type=$(file -0 -F\" \" \"$f\" | grep -aPo '\\0\\s*\\K\\S+') \n    mv \"$f\" \"${f%%.*}.${type,,}\"  \ndone\n\nThis is the same idea as @A.B's answer but using shell globs instead of find. The ${f%%.*} is the filename without its extension. The -0 of the file command makes it print a \\0 after the file name which we then use to grep the file type. This should work with arbitrary file names, including those that contain spaces, newlines or anything else. The ${type,,} is a trick to get lower case extensions. It would convert PNG to png.\nYou didn't say in your question, but if you need this to be recursive and descend into subdirectories, you could use this instead:\nshopt -s globstar\nfor f in **/*jpg; do \n    type=$(file -0 -F\" \" \"$f\" | grep -aPo '\\0\\s*\\K\\S+') \n    mv \"$f\" \"${f%%.*}.${type,,}\"  \ndone\n\nThe shopt -s globstar will enable bash's globstar option which lets ** match subdirectories:\n\nglobstar\nIf set, the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or  more  directories and  subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by a /, only directories and subdirectories match.\n\n\nA: The script below can be used to (recursively) rename an incorrectly set extension, .jpg, to the correct one. In case it finds an unreadable file, it will report it in the script's output.\nThe script use the imghdr module, to recognize the following types: rgb, gif, pbm, pgm, ppm, tiff, rast, xbm, jpeg, bmp, png. More on the imghdr module here. The list can be extended with more types, as mentioned in the link. \nAs it is, it specifically renames files with the extension .jpg, as mentioned in the question. With a minor change, it can be fit to rename any extension, or a specific set of extensions, into the correct one (or with no extension, like here).\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport imghdr\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n    for name in files:\n        file = root+\"/\"+name\n        # find files with the (incorrect) extension to rename\n        if name.endswith(\".jpg\"):\n            # find the correct extension\n            ftype = imghdr.what(file)\n            # rename the file\n            if ftype != None:\n                shutil.move(file, file.replace(\"jpg\",ftype))\n            # in case it can't be determined, mention it in the output\n            else:\n                print(\"could not determine: \"+file)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as rename.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/rename.py <directory>\n\n", "Q: Krusader/dolphin safe to use for sftp without sha256?

I have installed Lubuntu 15.04 on my EEE PC 701 with the file-system BTRFS. I want to deduplicate my data, but I don't know how.\n\nA: I always used bedup. It is very fast and reliable. This tool is also mentioned on official btrfs page. I've never used duperemove (bedup is older).\n\nA: Start by making a full backup so that if something goes wrong you haven't lost anything.\nI believe you are looking for duperemove -d\n\"Duperemove is a simple tool for finding duplicated extents and submitting them for deduplication. When given a list of files it will hash their contents on a block by block basis and compare those hashes to each other, finding and categorizing extents that match each other. When given the -d option, duperemove will submit those extents for deduplication using the btrfs-extent-same ioctl.\nDuperemove has two major modes of operation one of which is a subset of the other.\nReadonly / Non-deduplicating Mode\nWhen run without -d (the default) duperemove will print out one or more tables of matching extents it has determined would be ideal candidates for deduplication. As a result, readonly mode is useful for seeing what duperemove might do when run with '-d'. The output could also be used by some other software to submit the extents for deduplication at a later time.\nIt is important to note that this mode will not print out all instances of matching extents, just those it would consider for deduplication.\nGenerally, duperemove does not concern itself with the underlying representation of the extents it processes. Some of them could be compressed, undergoing I/O, or even have already been deduplicated. In dedupe mode, the kernel handles those details and therefore we try not to replicate that work.\nDeduping Mode\nThis functions similarly to readonly mode with the exception that the duplicated extents found in our \"read, hash, and compare\" step will actually be submitted for deduplication.

I have lost a disk in the array, he simply went offline and after a few days the second one started to drop errors as well. As the system detected check sum errors on the second disk that has started to fail (some bad sectors according to SMART) it started to re-silver the array and when i got to the PC and saw the re-silvering was already at 40%, in order to avoid a catastrophe I have decided to stop the server asap.  \nSo basically my array looks like almost like this, and somewhere it is mentioned that data's were lost :  \nNAME                                    STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM\nMisu                                    DEGRADED     0     0     0\n  raidz1-0                              ONLINE       0     0     0\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-9YN_Z1F1587B  OFFLINE      0     0     0   (failed hdd)\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-9YN_Z1F14J7V  ONLINE       0     0     0\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-9YN_Z1F14JYL  ONLINE       0     0     0\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G04F  ONLINE       0     0     0\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G1H7  ONLINE       134   5     139 (failing hdd)  \n\nSince the resilver process take some time i'm quite afraid of replacing the first disk and hope that the second one, the one that has checksum errors will not fail. So i have decided  to replace the PCB on the first failed disk since it had pcb problems and not mecanical problems.  \nSo, if i manage to make the first disk running what shall i do next, how will zfs know that the disk was not replace (not sure but i believe that changing the pcb will change the serial number and stuff for that disk) and detect the disk as the original member?\nAny other information that can help me not to make this worse?\n\nA: Reimport the pool read-only and make a backup while it is still mountable.  You have two bad disks in a pool with one level of parity protection, and if the second disk also faults offline, then the problem becomes much worse.  Avoid sleeping or power-cycling the hardware until you have a backup.\nOpenZFS can recognize data on the repaired disk regardless of whether changing the PCB changes the disk serial number.  If the repaired disk reappears in the system with a different /dev name, then just reimport the pool.  Resilvering must happen on the repaired disk before the second failing disk can be replaced, which is when a fatal error is likely to happen.\nNote that this may be a 'bathtub' failure because the disks seem to be from the same manufacturing batch.  If so, then expect additional failures.\n\nA: I see this message is very old, however, I'll add the resolution I suggest in case somebody else run into the same problem.\nWhat you have to do is launch zpool replace command against your drive with errors, not against the drive that is OFFLINE.\nI'll clarify.\nIf you replace the drive OFFLINE, your changes to recover the information disappear.\nYou'll still have one drive with errors, so those files affected will not be recoverable.\nBut if you launch the zpool replace command against the drive with errors, so, scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G1H7, you will recover the same information than in the previous case, but you'll have the chance to recover the rest if you're able to make the OFFLINE drive live again.\nIMO this is the best way to proceed. ZFS will know which data is healthy from the drive with errors and the Resilver will be a bit faster, as ZFS is reading from more drives. Also, in case that other drives have errors in a block of the stripe but the drive returning errors have the Data in good state, you'll be able to recover that stripe, so you'll not loss Data if errors in another drive but not in the others, including scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G1H7.\nSo do not OFFLINE scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G1H7.\nZFS is very good using the information it can from failing drives, so it will do its best.\nIf your pool was composed by 14TB drives and you had 10TB full in each drive, it will take less than 24 hours to Resilver these 10TB to the new drive. (Drives ~200MB/s 5.4K rpm)\nYour drives are Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 3000GB / 3TB 7.2K 6.0 Gb/s SATA Desktop so Resilvering the drive assuming the pool was 100% full would take less than 8 hours.\nCheers\n", "Q: reboot and shutdown executables missing I'm working with some proprietary scripts for a embedded Linux project.  One of the scripts replaces the reboot and shutdown executables in /sbin/ with a symlink to a Perl program.  I ran this script prematurely and now I am missing these two executables.  \nMy efforts at finding which package in Linux contains these executables has been futile, I've tried upstart as well as several others that I could think of or search for.\nAny advice for recovering\\reinstalling these executables?  I can always just use init 0 and init 6... but I'd prefer the executables.\n\nA: I think the answers above can give the result but i'll use a logical approach to reach the same result.\nTo know a specific file belongs to which package you can use:\ndpkg -S /path-to-file\n\nNow lets check shutdown andreboot path\n$which shutdown \n/sbin/shutdown\n\n$which reboot\n/sbin/reboot\n\nNow let's check the package belonging to it\n$ dpkg -S /sbin/shutdown\nupstart: /sbin/shutdown\n\n$ dpkg -S /sbin/reboot\nupstart: /sbin/reboot\n\nSo as a conclusion shutdown andreboot belongs to upstart package, so now you can easily just reinstall the package\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall upstart\n\n\nA: And now, the version 15 answer.\nEveryone else has assumed version 14 and told you to look where you had already looked with no success.  They missed the clue where you said in the question:My efforts at finding which package in Linux contains these executables has been futile, I've tried upstart\nOn version 15 out of the box, there aren't any such executables.  They were symbolic links, to start with, that were provided by the systemd-sysv package.  You don't need to reinstall anything, really.  The program that you run by these names hasn't been deleted.  You just put the symbolic links back.ln -f -s -- ../bin/systemctl /sbin/reboot\nln -f -s -- ../bin/systemctl /sbin/shutdown\nThe clue in what you said about upstart, of course, is that these commands were removed from the upstart package for version 15, precisely so that it could be installed subordinate to systemd.  The conflicting upstart commands and instrumentation necessary for running upstart as process #1 were moved into the upstart-sysv package.  So of course you didn't find them in the upstart package.\nDon't mix and match these toolsets.  Either systemd-sysv or upstart-sysv.  Not a mixture of both.  As I said, on systemd Ubuntu Linux version 15 you can simply put the symbolic links back directly without fussing about with packages at all.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/196471/5132\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/196014/5132\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/77029/\n\n*split out upstart-sysv  1422681.

As I understand it Linux Containers are referred to as light-weight virtualization; virtualization without all the extra OS for every service that is run.  Docker utilizes Linux Containers, and Docker has the possibility of running on Snappy Ubuntu Core.  \nDoes the stack mentioned above require the processor it is running on to have VT-X or other virtualization technology?

(14.04) I have an external Seagate HDD (/dev/sdb) with 2 partitions connected to my media center (Acer 3820TG laptop running 14.04) and it keeps the computer from suspending. Since I want my media center to be quick to boot, I would rather use suspend than a complete shutdown. The HDD contains all of the media files, so it is essential to the setup.\nI tried to simply unmount both partitions (/dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2) but I run into the same situation as before, where the screen goes black for 5-10 seconds before the computer resumes.\nWith the udisks --detach /dev/sdb/ command, though, I get what I want: the drive powers off and the computer can suspend. \nHow could I setup an automated way to: \n1) detach /dev/sdb before suspending and\n2) re-mount /dev/sdb after resuming?\n\nA: Personally, I'd approach this with a simple script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# find if we have sdb mounted\n\ndf | grep -iq /dev/sdb\n\n# if the last command tells us we found\n# something, then unmount it and suspend the system\n# two seconds later\n\nif [  $? -eq 0 ]; then\n\n  sudo udisks --detach /dev/sdb/\n  sleep 2\n  sudo pm-suspend\nfi\n\nOptionally you can add a line gnome-screensaver-command -l to lock the screen before suspending\n", "Q: Crashplan service prevents suspend After a long trial/error process, I finally identified crashplan service as the reason for my laptop not suspending after lid is closed. I have two different Ubuntu laptops, both are suffering from this problem...\nI believe it will be difficult to influence crashplan to change this behavior, but I was wondering if it is possible to add an action to stop crashplan on when lid is closed and start it back when it is back on.\nAny thoughts? Thanks! \n\nA: Direct answer to your question:\nYou can use the lid switch to trigger a script that stops the Crashplan service. See Laptop Lid and Dock Scripts on the Help Wiki.\nAlso see comments and answers of Catch lid close and open events.\nThere are also a bunch of examples for scripts written for different kinds of events people wanted to trigger with the lid switch in the Ubuntu Forums--a bit chaotic, but the examples could be helpful as you write yours.\nHowever, it may not actually be Crashplan that is the problem.\nIf your swap drive is encrypted, that could actually be what is interfering with hibernation. (In a way, Crashplan may have indirectly been the cause--I'll explain more...) You may not have knowingly set up an encrypted swap drive; this happens automatically when you choose to encrypt your home directory during installation of Ubuntu 9.10 and above. \nFurthermore, you may never have noticed that your swap partition was encrypted because you would still have the ability to hibernate if your fstab identifies your swap space by UUID.\nThis only becomes a problem when your swap drive fills up (which it very likely might have done while you were running Crashplan, since many of its processes like file restores are long and resource/memory-intensive). When full, everything about the encrypted swap is overwritten, including UUID, so upon attempting to wake up from hibernation, your system wouldn't know where to find your swap drive--it would be searching for a UUID that didn't exist anymore. \nSo you may not need to write a \"stop service\" script activated by the lid switch at all. You may just need to deal with your swap. \nTwo possibilities are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Modifying your settings so that your swap drive is identified by /dev/sdXX instead of by UUID and also the system is supplied with a randomly generated key when needed (/dev/urandom). See this answer for explicit instructions. It involves editing crypttab and fstab, both of which you should back up before changing. \n\n*Opting for unencrypted swap. Obviously, the latter is not a recommended solution, but personally I think that for the average user, it's not a huge deal to have an unencrypted swap partition. You can read more about it and decide for yourself. See here for instructions on how to do that.\nAlso see the Ubuntu Help Wiki on the caveats of encrypted home and how hibernation is affected.\nNote: This question is 2 years old, so even though it would be best to get more information before answering, I thought it was unlikely the OP would respond, so I went ahead and posted an answer.\n", "Q: Performance of Phenom II X6 processor in Ubuntu I've never used Ubuntu before, and I will be using it for the first time.

You might also want to run\nsudo evtest /dev/input/event2 (or wherever your controller is)\n\nto get an idea of why this is happening in the first place.\n\nA: If you're still having this issue, I figured out a solution. This was done on a Raspberry Pi, but it should work on Ubuntu as well (I don't know how to edit the command line on Ubuntu but I'm sure there's a way to do it easily).\nCopied from my post on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroPie/comments/3drzqt/anyone_using_a_wii_u_pro_controller_adapter_with/\nRun lsusb -v and look for the idVendor and idProduct of your Mayflash adapter (they were 0x0079 and 0x1800, respectively, for me).\nAdd the following string to the end of your /boot/cmdline.txt file:\nusbhid.quirks=idVendor:idProduct:0x40\n\nReplace idVendor and idProduct with the values you found earlier.

You'll probably want the highest resolution listed there. After that, change the scale to 1. \nIf that is impossible or turns out to be incredibly difficult, you can press CTRL + ALT + T, which should get a terminal open. Whether or not it shows up in your zoomed-in version of the display, however, is unknown to me. If that doesn't work, you can get a command line from the GRUB boot menu, by selecting Advanced boot options for Ubuntu, and then pressing C. Once you have the terminal open, you can try this command:\n$ rm ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\nwhich should reset your resolution. After that, you need to restart your computer and you still should go to the System Settings > Displays menu and make sure that the Scale for menus and title bars is set to 1. \nHope that helped.\n", "Q: New to UBUNTU, problems installing steam \n*\n\n*Distributor ID:   Ubuntu\n\n*Description:  Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\n\n*Release:  14.04\n\n*Codename: trusty\n\n\nfirefox\nSteam needs to install these additional packages: \nlibgl1-mesa-dri:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386, libc6:i386\n[sudo] password for gbs2: \n..........................................................................................................\nReading package lists...

I'm not sure if it's the \"uefi with csm\" or the win8 usb that made booting possible but now the laptop can boot into windows through uefi.\n...I did download that boot repair iso and it works seamlessly!! like a charm!! so far I have here this http://paste.ubuntu.com/11564001/ that shows some kind of info about the laptop's partitions and bootloaders' info nd things like that.\n\nupdate2:\nSummary for my mistakes:\n(Don't do these things! Hope it helps anyone)\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't boot the live Ubuntu usb with legacy mode when you have your previous operating systems setup on uefi mode.\n\n*Your live usb's format should be FAT32 for it to be bootable on uefi mode. (not ext4 XD)\n\n*Careful where you place your bootloader!! ...sadly I have no more advice on exactly where to place it but do your search\n\n*This Boot Repair Disk can really come in very handy if nothing is booting. Keep it around.\n\n*If Ubuntu just hangs after booting you might wanna try booting with the \"nomodeset\" option. (see this)\n\n*ask for help when you need it, search a lot, never freak-out, check your iso carefully before installing your system -_- and never forget your root password. -____- XD What a day! Cheers :D\n\nA: Some observations on your Boot Repair output:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have no BIOS-mode boot loader in the MBR of /dev/sda, but you do have EFI-mode boot loaders for both Windows and Ubuntu in the EFI System Partition (ESP) on that disk. This indicates EFI-mode installations of both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*Your /dev/sdb has a BIOS-mode copy of GRUB in its MBR and uses the older MBR partition table. This indicates that Ubuntu was installed to it in BIOS mode at some point. Note that mixing EFI-mode and BIOS-mode OS installations is usually pretty awkward. It's also unclear whether the EFI-mode or BIOS-mode Ubuntu install was more recent.\n\n*It's not clear if you've got a working Ubuntu installation on /dev/sdb1. There are some critical files on that partition, but Boot Repair has not identified some others. Maybe that's a Boot Repair slip-up, or maybe they're absent.\n\n*Your GUID Partition Table's (GPT's) protective MBR on /dev/sda has an end sector of 4,294,967,295. This is as large as is theoretically possible, and is roughly four times as big as your disk can handle. The Boot Repair output comments on this, on line 108: /dev/sda1 ends after the last sector of /dev/sda. I would expect that most tools would be OK with this, but it's entirely possible that something (GRUB, perhaps) is not.\n\n\nI recommend you deal with the final point first. You should be able to do this from your Ubuntu emergency disc by using gdisk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Launch gdisk on the disk by typing sudo gdisk /dev/sda.\n\n*Type p to view your partitions and verify that they're sensible. If not, your disk device filenames might have changed or gdisk might have a problem with your malformed protective MBR, so you should quit.\n\n*Type x to enter the experts' menu.\n\n*Type n to create a new protective MBR.\n\n*Type p to view your partitions again to ensure you haven't typed an incorrect command and wiped them out accidentally.\n\n*Type w to save your changes. Respond affirmatively when gdisk asks for confirmation.\n\n\nAt this point, you might be able to boot normally, but I make no promises of that. If you continue to have problems, I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try running Boot Repair again. It might do better once the protective MBR has been repaired.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium with it. Boot to it. It should enable you to boot Windows, and if the Ubuntu install on /dev/sdb1 is complete, rEFInd should enable you to boot it, too. (Note that rEFInd might show multiple Linux/Ubuntu options. One should launch GRUB, and the others, if present, should launch Linux kernels. The kernels are more likely to work than the GRUB entry.) If this gets Ubuntu booting, you can either install rEFInd using its Debian package or PPA or you can try installing GRUB manually.\n\n\nIf neither Boot Repair nor rEFInd lets you boot, I recommend you try re-installing at this point. If you have no data on /dev/sdb, I recommend you delete its partitions, convert it from MBR to GPT, and install in EFI mode. See my Web page on EFI-mode Linux installations for details on how to do this. As I noted earlier, mixing EFI-mode and BIOS-mode installs is tricky at best, and given that your EFI-mode Windows installation is working, that makes it easiest to redo the Ubuntu installation in EFI mode rather than convert Windows to a BIOS-mode boot. If you have important user data on /dev/sdb, I still recommend you do as I've just described, but back up your data first.\n", "Q: How to run a php file after writing it and saving in vi editor I have written a PHP code using vi editor and saved it as Test.php. What is the command to run the file in terminal?\n\nA: You can install PHP-cli :\nsudo apt-get install php5-cli\n\nThen in terminal :\nphp /path-to-Test.php\n\nsuppose you save your Test.php in your Desktop then the command would be\nphp ~/Desktop/Test.php\n\nOr you can\ncd ~/Desktop\nphp ./Test.php\n\n\nEDIT: based to your comment above: command becomes\nphp  ~/root/adserver/adson/Test.php \n\n\nA: You can also put this at the first line of your PHP script:\n#!/usr/bin/env php\n\nThis tells your shell that this file should be run with php. After this, if you make your script executable, e.g. with\nchmod +x Test.php\n\nThen you can run it as it were a binary executable:\n./Test.php\n\nor with the full path:\n./~/root/adserver/adson/Test.php\n\nNote: Of course you still need to have php5-cli installed.\n\nA: If you are using vim to edit your file you can even execute it within the editor with the command:\n:!php %\n\nThe ! indicates to vim that you want to call an external function, php is the external function to execute and % referes to your current file (which is the one you want to pass to php as an argument).\nAnd as vim is an amazing tool you can even improve your productivity with a mapping. To do so you can add the following line to your .vimrc:\nmap <C-e> <Esc> :w<CR> :!php %<CR>\n\nThis way while you are editing when you will press Esc+e your file will be saved and then the external call to php will be done. \nThe details of the mapping are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*<Esc> makes you leave insert mode if you are still editing to enable normal mode.\n\n*:w<CR> calls the write function to save your changes.\n\n*The last part is the command I gave you at the beginning of my answer.\n\n\nOf course to work this method needs that you install php-cli as suggested by @Maythux in his answer.\n", "Q: GVim extra linespace I recently installed GVim and set the font to DejaVu Sans Mono size 11, but I noticed that there are 2 pixel lines between the lines, making the lines look apart.

If anyone can give proper guidance as to how to fix it that would be super appreciated.\nProblem Description: \nWhile being connected to Wifi the connection is terribly slow. Running speed-test with Win7 on the very same machine and on another Mac machine result in much higher speeds (~10-100 fold or more).\nUsing the terminal to check my hardware type: lspci | grep -i network I get the following  \n00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82577LM Gigabit Network Connection (rev 06)\n02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1000 [Condor Peak]\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I had the same problem with a X201, but with a  Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6200 (rev 35) Wifi controler.\nOne thing that helped was to go to the bios setup, load the default configuration and save changes. But this was only temporarily.\nFor another reason I disabled DHCP and set a fix IP to the wifi connection.

It was pretty simple in ubuntu 14.04 downloading and opening in software center, but in lubuntu that is not working. I have installed it using package installer but when I restart my computer I see same kernel. \nCan any one guide me how to downgrade linux kernal \n\nA: Press an hold shift just before grub starts (if your PC does not show grub at boot), choose \"advanced options for ubuntu\" and you will see all the previously installed kernels you have have, just choose the one you want.\nNot listed ? Google the version you need, install it and then use the grub menu to select it.\n\n\nA: You should boot an older kernel, then remove the one you no longer need (I assume that is the latest one). You can use the command line interface of apt-get if the GUI programs are lacking and should remove the appropriate linux-image-* and linux-headers-* packages.\nUpdate: To get to the GRUB menu, change your GRUB configuration in /etc/default/grub. These keys should be modified:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\n\nThis sets the menu as always visible, with a 10 second timeout.\n", "Q: Why does Genymotion need Virtualbox to run? Genymotion is a new  Android Emulator that could be only used from inside a VirtualBox running Ubuntu.\nWhy I can't just use it in my native physical Ubuntu system?\n\nI know how to install it, I already did it, I'm asking why this doesn't work on PC. Why it does just work on VirtualBox? \n\nA: Because \n\nGenymotion operation relies on the use of Oracle VM VirtualBox in the background. This enables virtualizing Android operating systems.\n\nYour question seems to end in a cirle: Genymotion is a virtualBox based Android Emulator. So the answer basically ends up in: because Genymotion decided on that. \n\nA: Genymotion needs VirtualBox. It creates virtual devices (android phones). In short, VirtualBox takes some of your computer's memory and allocates that memory to a virtual device. It's all about the concept of virtualization. Without VirtualBox, you can't run Genymotion On macOS, windows, or Linux.\n", "Q: Bluetooth (Atheros AR3012) not working on Ubuntu 15.04 I have a Zenbook UX21 and I'm not able to get bluetooth up and running.\nI've just installed blueman and bluez, but I'm still not able to connect devices because they are not found. \nuname -a\nLinux daniel-UX21E 3.19.0-18-generic #18-Ubuntu SMP Tue May 19 18:31:35 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nlsusb | grep -i \"bluetooth\"\nBus 003 Device 006: ID 13d3:3375 IMC Networks Atheros AR3012 Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter\n\nhcitool dev\nDevices:\n\n(empty list)\nrfkill list\n0: phy0: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n1: asus-wlan: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n2: asus-bluetooth: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n3: hci0: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n\nEdit: Jeremy helped me to fix my problem temporary (sudo hciconfig hci0 up).\nUnfortunately, Bluetooth is not working after I restarted my notebook.\nhciconfig -a does not list a device, all other commands return the same as before (see comments below).

For my Gnome Shell, I have disabled that Workspaces should be on primary display only. So now, whenever I switch the workspace, both monitors switch their content as they should.\nYet when I press Meta in order to get a preview of my Workspaces, all I see is the preview of the workspace's content of the primary monitor.\nThis makes navigating my worksapces pretty hard as I have to know on which secondary monitor some window is hiding.\nHow do I get a prewiew of all monitors' content in the preview?\n\nA: This is doable with an extension called multi-monitors-add-on.\nYou can also find it on extensions.gnome.org for installation.\nIf you are using the latest version of Gnome shell (3.14 and 3.16) use the master branch:\ngit clone git://github.com/spin83/multi-monitors-add-on.git\ncd multi-monitors-add-on\ncp -r multi-monitors-add-on@spin83 ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions\n\nFor Ubuntu 14.04, which has Gnome shell 3.10, use the gnome-3-10 branch:\ngit clone git://github.com/spin83/multi-monitors-add-on.git\ngit checkout gnome-3-10\ncd multi-monitors-add-on\ncp -r multi-monitors-add-on@spin83 ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions\n\nthen restart gnome shell and enable the extension.

Why do GUI-based packages update and CLI-based packages update differ?\nMany times after updating Ubuntu packages via GUI, it ask me to restart my computer. However, when I do it via the command-line it never ask me to restart the computer. These seem contradictory to me. If it is that important to restart after some important packages are installed, why does the command-line never ask for it? Should I always use the GUI method then?\n\nA: On a command line interface (CLI) I guess you do\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAFAIK a GUI does\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\ndist-upgrade will/can remove/update packages that change dependencies. thus a restart can be  needed.\nWhen you do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade on CLI, you will see that a restart is recommended sometimes too.\nA GUI is not technically or security wise superior.

Distorted audio\nSometimes, when playing some music file, it just does not sound right - for example it sounds like it's distorted by overmodulating - but it's not so strong that it is obvious how it was distorted. Part of the distortion may even intended effects in the original recording.\nPresent in file, or caused by playing it?\nThe problem is, that even when there is a distortion, it may not be from the file, but added later in the processing steps of pulseaudio, when it mixes relative volumes together.\nWhere to start looking?\nTo know where I have to look for the issue, I would like to have some kind of test tool, that can recognize and identify strong typical distortions - so strong that they are even audible, so the detection may well be possible.\nWith this, if the mp3 file tests ok, I know I need to fix my volume setting. If not, maybe I can just accept the distortion from the original.\nFinding the feature\nThere are various audio tools, from sox to audacious, but I do not know where to look for what I need here.\nIt could be a command line tool, or a feature in the menu of a complex program.\n\nA: One easy to use tool is Audacity which has the capability of showing distortion in your original file in an easy to under stand graphical manner. Simply import your file and then activate the clipping detection by using:\nView --> Show Clipping\n\nand you will see vertical red lines to indicate where the distortion is occurring. See below on a stereo mp3 file of my own:\n\nThis will give you an idea of any distortion in the original file, Audacity also has a tool that you might like to try to fix the issue under:\nEffect --> Clip Fix \n\nwhich I confess has had varied results on my own system...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audacity Waveform\n\n*Clip Fix\n", "Q: How to uninstall a which did not get installed properly when I tried to install dropbox it did not get installed properly it now only shows the icon and does not work too so I want to uninstall it if I do it using gui nothing happens and it is still there if I do it using terminal it shows this\nsairamakrishna@Krishna:~$ sudo apt-get remove dropbox\n[sudo] password for sairamakrishna: \nReading package lists...

Pressing ctrl + c will stop the stream, and typing shift + f will continue the stream.\nThis also gives you the added benefit of being able to highlight things you care about. For example, typing /my_search_term (forward-search) or ?my_search_term (backward-search) will also highlight my_search_term in the file. This highlighting will continue as new data streams in.\nHow do I output to a file?\nThere are a couple of options, but for completeness, this may be best:\nstart_rails_server &>> my_new_logfile\n\nThe &> will pipe both the stdout and stderr to the log file. (You can pick one or the other by using a number, 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr, though stdout is implicit so you could just do cmd > file and you would get stdout printed to your file.)\nThe angle bracket sends the output to my_new_logfile, and the fact that there are two means that it will append to the file if it exists, and create a new one if not. If you used a single angle bracket, then any existing file would be overwritten:\nstart_rails_server &> my_new_logfile\n\n\nA: Click Edit→Profiles→Scrolling. Then increase the value under limit scrollback to: or untick it to allow scrolling through unlimited lines.\n\nFrom comment by Kevin: Be careful with unchecking that option.

Does your usb external hard drive have an seperate power supply. Make sure the power supply is plugged in. USB 3.0 is backwards compatible with usb 2.0 ports but usb 3.0 allows more power over the connection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB. Also I might try another port. Also usb 3.0 can have power management which the powertop package if you install can be useful to troubleshoot but remember you need to use this with sudo in a terminal to change hardware settings. Also maybe try in control center to not give the popup for the media to prompt every time you put a drive in if it causes your computer to crash but this is more of a workaround.

With the following command, a video is created, with the expected duration:\navconv -framerate 20 -i '%05d.png' -b 65536k out.mov\n\nProblem: only the first frame (00000.png) is used, for the whole video. Nothing moves.\nThe files are there, and they are different from one another:\ngauthier@sobel:/tmp/overlay $ ll *.png | head -3\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gauthier gauthier 431982 Jun  4 15:45 00000.png\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gauthier gauthier 446261 Jun  4 15:45 00001.png\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gauthier gauthier 459096 Jun  4 15:45 00002.png\ngauthier@sobel:/tmp/overlay $ ll *.png | tail -3\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gauthier gauthier 470976 Jun  4 15:38 00648.png\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gauthier gauthier 470976 Jun  4 15:38 00649.png\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gauthier gauthier 470976 Jun  4 15:38 00650.png\n\nI suppose there is something fishy about the file name matching pattern, but I cannot find what. I tried with -f image2, that did not help.\n\nA: Oh my. Saving as out.mp4 instead of out.mov worked. The second after I posted the question.\n", "Q: Installation of python's numpy keeps failing I'm trying to install numpy but the installation keeps failing for some reason.\nActually, what I need is

For some reason the TL version shipped with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from the repository is not recent enough. It is possible to get the latest version (TeXLive 2015) via the install scripts from CTAN mirror (see this\nanswer on SX) or from a Ubuntu specific script (see another\nanswer on SX\n)\n\n*Run the latex file with latex->dvips->ps2pdf to get the desired results.

And it should automatically resize if you change the GUI size too.\nVBoxManage edits a config file so you can do it manually if you want. \"virtualbox.xml\" and \"machine.xml\" where machine is your instance. The latter holds screen resolutions.\nEditing those files manually should be avoided. I would 1st try the guest additions, then vboxmanage and then manual. The latter can kill your VBox instance (so do make a backup).\nThe VBoxManage command to set a custom resolution is:\nVBoxManage setextradata \"<VM name>\" \"CustomVideoMode1\" \"1280x720x32\"\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 login keyboard stuck on english.

I know I have an account for Steam but I'm not sure if it saves all this.\n\nA: Although Steam is available and officially supported for Ubuntu, not all of the games sold there are. Visit the store page of the games you want to keep playing and look out for the system requirements:\n\nIf it has a Linux tab, then you should be fine. Else, your game will most likely not run on Ubuntu, at the most with Wine, but don't have too high expectations.\nIf the game is Linux compatible, your game progress etc. will still be available, as Steam stores that on its servers.\nOnly with screenshots you have to watch out. After you quit a Steam game and you took screenshots, you are prompted to upload them. If you don't, they'll only stay locally.\n\nA: Steam uses cloud to save your game data so it doesn't matter which OS you use, the necessary thing is that you are logged in as your steam user. \n", "Q: How to filter out device info from `usb-devices` using VID & PID?

I want to use my media keys when using i3wm. \nWhen I am using Unity, all media keys work. When I use i3 none of my keys work even though they are detected properly by xev, so I assume there is some process that runs when I run Unity that handles this. I am running unity-settings-daemon but it doesn't seem to control the media keys.\n\nA: For me this works with PulseAudio:\n# volume control\nbindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec /usr/bin/pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -- '-5%'\nbindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec /usr/bin/pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ '+5%'\nbindsym XF86AudioMute exec /usr/bin/pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle\n\n\nA: i3 doesn't have those keybindings by default. You can add them by editing your ~/.i3/config file.\nE.g. for the volume keys, you can use something like:\nbindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume 0 +5%\nbindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -5%\nbindsym XF86AudioMute exec pactl set-sink-mute 0 toggle\n\nOther media key names are:\nXF86AudioPlay\nXF86AudioPrev\nXF86AudioNext\nXF86AudioStop\nXF86HomePage\n\nYou can assign them accordingly. E.g. I'm using DBus to control Clementine with bindings like:\n#Pause actually works as a play toggle for MPRIS interfaces.\nbindsym XF86AudioPlay exec qdbus org.mpris.clementine /Player Pause\n\nAfter assigning the new keybindings, restart i3 with Alt+⇑Shift+R\n", "Q: creating partition /biosboot for fedora 22 I've installed fedora 22. I've created a partition /biosboot for this. After restarting I found fedora 22 and other two linux distro ( ubuntu and linux mint)\nbut windows 7 disappear. How I get windows 7 along with linux? \n\nA: First, a BIOS Boot Partition is not mounted and so is not referred to as \"/biosboot\" -- the leading slash normally indicates a mounted partition or a directory in the root (/) filesystem. This may seem pedantic, but the point is to highlight that I'm making an assumption that you're talking about a true BIOS Boot Partition and not simply some random partition that you've mounted at /biosboot. If you've done the latter, all bets are off and the below may not apply....\nA BIOS Boot Partition is meaningful only on GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks and is useful only when booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If you're booting Windows from a GPT disk, though, Windows must necessarily be booting in EFI/UEFI mode -- that's a Windows limitation. Thus, your question implies that you've installed Fedora in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode but have an existing Windows installation in EFI/UEFI mode. (Your Mint and Ubuntu installations were probably also in EFI mode, but they can switch pretty easily and so would still boot in BIOS mode after you installed a BIOS-mode GRUB.) There is one possible flaw in this analysis: You didn't specify how many disks your computer has. If you've got two disks, you might be booting Windows in BIOS mode from an MBR disk and Fedora in BIOS mode from a GPT disk. If this is the case, the below doesn't apply; but if you've got a single disk, or if all your disks use GPT, read on....\nThe first thing to do is to disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support in your firmware. How to do this varies from one computer to another. On a few systems, it can't really be controlled by the user, in which case you'll need to poke around to figure out how to force the computer to boot in EFI/UEFI mode. Knowing the brand and model of your computer (or motherboard, if it's self-built) may be helpful.\nOnce you disable BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, the computer should boot using whatever boot loader you'd used before. Chances are you'll then be able to boot Windows, Mint, and Ubuntu, but not Fedora. You can boot into whatever OS controls GRUB (presumably Mint or Ubuntu) and do a sudo update-grub to get it to detect Fedora.\n\nEDIT: Based on your Boot Info Script output, you appear to have an EFI-mode installation of Windows and a BIOS-mode installation of Ubuntu, Mint, and Fedora. There's no evidence of an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux, which you must have to boot all your OSes. Here's how to recover:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support in your firmware. Using this feature is what got you into the problem in the first place, and disabling it will help you control your boot process in the future. The next step requires booting your computer in EFI mode, which you can do most reliably by disabling the CSM. I can't provide detailed instructions on how to do this because the details vary from one computer to another. The options appear in the firmware's setup utility (what most people erroneously call the \"BIOS setup utility\"), so you'll have to dig through there. Chances are you manually enabled the CSM, since most modern computers ship with it disabled. (If your computer predates Windows 8, though, it may have shipped with the CSM enabled.) Note that \"enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support\" is sometimes phrased as \"disabling EFI/UEFI booting,\" although this latter phrasing is rare.\n\n*Install an EFI boot loader for Linux. Several are available, but the two that are likely to be easiest to install are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My rEFInd -- You can do a test using the USB flash drive or CD-R image, available on the rEFInd downloads page. It should show you options for Windows and for both Ubuntu and Mint, although they may be hard to tell apart initially. Also, your Fedora install seems to put the kernel inside an LVM, so you'll need to split off a separate /boot partition to get it to work, or at least copy your Fedora kernels to the ESP or some other accessible location. (You can tackle that later.) If rEFInd works from a removable media, install its Debian package or PPA from Ubuntu or Mint, then tackle fine-tuning it: Create a /boot partition for Fedora and give the Ubuntu and Mint partitions names of \"Ubuntu\" and \"LinuxMint,\" respectively, so that rEFInd will show the correct icons.\n\n*GRUB and Boot Repair -- The Boot Repair tool can automatically fix many GRUB problems; however to work in your case it must be run from EFI mode. Also, it's an automated script that might or might not get everything right in your complex quadruple-boot configuration, and there's no way to know whether it will do the right thing except by setting it loose on your system, so there's a risk that it will make things worse. If it works, though, everything will come together immediately.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, I'd say that it's probably better to use virtualization (VirtualBox, QEMU, VMware, etc.) rather than try to boot so many OSes on \"bare metal.\" Multi-boot setups like yours are complex and difficult to maintain, whereas virtualization enables you to isolate each OS in its own container, thus making things much simpler to manage.\n", "Q: How to change chromium-browser indicator icon?

Intel i5 processor\ni recently installed ubuntu alongside windows 8.1 and manually allocated swap space of 21 GB and extr space of 76 GB. and the system info after installation shows memory:3.8 GB and disk space:72 GB . I feel my os is slow. What should i do?\n\nA: \nmanually allocated swap space of 21 GB\n\nThis is  a bit of an overkill. Swap's purpose is to assist RAM, and usually the same size of swap as ram is enough, especially in your case where you have 4GB of RAM. Big swap size is necessary on machines with low ram, not in your case. \n\nthe system info after installation shows memory:3.8 GB and disk\n  space:72 GB\n\nHere's the thing about *nix type systems : since hard drives are divided into blocks of 512 bytes,, *nix system report size as calculated from number of those blocks. Humans think in power of 10, computers - in power of 2, so if you see your memory and hard drive space being reported somewhat different, don't be surprised. Here's an example: If I do df -h, where -h is human readable size (as calculated with powers of 2 ), I get 145G . With df -H (which is also human readable, but with powers of 10), I get 156G. The first one makes more sense from engineering / computer science point of view, because it's closer to actual, physical organization of hard drive memory. So the confusion about the size might come from the fact that installer looks at hard drive space differently than the actual installed system.\nAs for the ram 4 GB vs 3.8 GB, again, RAM will always be reported less, because computer science 101 tells us that there's always some reserved memory , for instance - for peripherals like keyboard, screen, etc. If the difference would be large, that's where you'd have to start worrying. \n\nI feel my os is slow. What should i do?\n\nThere's plenty of material on this site and others on how to improve the performance - you just need to use your googlefu a little, and as bodhi already pointed out, lag often comes from graphics. I suggest you switch from default Unity desktop to something lighter. For instance , Gnome or Cinnamon. My personal favorites are openbox, blackbox, and gnome. They're minimalistic, but they do justice to the performance. \n", "Q: How to use the deja-backup I had asked the question 2 days before that I was able to connect to wifi but internet was not being accessed. \nI think I have messed up with some conf files because I tried too many solution. So I came up to the point to re install ubuntu 14.04 again. \nSo my question was I have backup but how would I use that backup after re installing os again. Or what I thought is copy the backup folder with hard drive and then again use it after I re install..\nThis is what I have in my mind...if any one has good solution it would be warmly welcomed. I do not want to loose the data any way\nThanks for the help\n\nA: You will have to have your backup folder copied to an external location, because you need the backup files to restore your data. So do that first. I recommend Dropbox or an external hard drive. Also, you can use the program Aptik (not installed by default) to backup your installed packages list and PPAs. \nOnce you have backed up your backup data to a safe location, you can reinstall Ubuntu. Transfer your backup files onto the new system. Then open Backups and select Restore, and follow the instructions to restore your data. Do the same for Aptik to restore your installed programs and PPAs. \n", "Q: hissing noise over headphones only in Ubuntu So I've looked at many of the other forums but nothing I've seen so far has eliminated my issue.  As soon as I boot up my laptop, Lenovo T440s, I start hearing a pop then a loud continious hiss that seems to cut out anytime the sound adjusted.  This only happens when I boot into Ubuntu, when I boot into windows I do not have this issue.  \nI tried muting my mic, I tried alsamixer, neither worked.  The pop and hissing does not happen over speakers, only headphones, and it happens with the same intensity no matter what my volume setting is, even when it's on mute.  \nWhen I open 'sound settings' it stops, but nothing I've done there has prevented it coming back.  The only thing so far that stops it is if I have other sounds playing.  It almost seems like it is a result of the soundcard not being used.  Any ideas out there? or forums that already dealt with this that I did not see?  Thanks\n\nA: This might be the Intel sound card entering power save mode. Check whether power save in currently enabled via:\n    cat /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n\nIf this returns 1, power save is enabled; it returns 0 otherwise. Check to see if changing this solves your problem by runnning\n    echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n\nThen play some music, pause it and see if the noise returns. If the problem persists, it's something else.\nIf this does get rid of the noise, you'll find it's only temporary, since the value can be reset on reboot or on switching between battery to AC power. A few different services could be changing this value, so try configuring each of them:\nALSA\nTo /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf, add the line:\n    options snd-hda-intel power_save=0\n\nPower.d\nTo /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/intel-audio-powersave, add or uncomment the line:\n        INTEL_AUDIO_POWERSAVE=false\nTLP\nIf installed, in /etc/default/tlp, set the following:\n    SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_BAT=0\n\n\nA: I was searching for solutions to this issue online and I found a topic that dealt with it. Based on the original answer I found, the most persistent method was to edit my \n/etc/init.d/alsa-<distro_dependent_filename>\n\nI added to the end of the start and reset sections the following:\nif [ -f /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save ]\nthen\n    log_action_begin_msg \"Trying workaround for Intel HDA...\"\n    echo 0 >/sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\nelse\n    log_action_begin_msg \"Not using Intel HDA workaround\"\nfi\n\nand change the top of the script from #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash\nAll it does is check if the Intel HDA power_save file exists and puts 0 into it. If not (like my 6-hour-power field-service portable) then gracefully announces it'll not use the work around.\nIt must have to do with awkward and bespoke hardware designs as the latest distros (late 2016) out there still do this to my \"portable desktop\". However, this fix so far works on most Ubuntu/Debian derivatives and some other distros (with my hardware AFAIK). \n\nP.S. This may be good Wiki material as I've commonly seen this happen on several \"portable Desktop\" type laptop machines with complex (2.1, 5.1 etc) sound-systems.\nName suggestion: Hissing Speaker Fixes\n", "Q: Why would removing a couple of modules remove lots of packages?

And compile + install them:\ncd src\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nTo compile your program from command line using SDL_bgi, make sure that it includes the 'SDL_bgi.h' header file. Then:\ngcc -o program program.c -lSDL_bgi -lSDL2\n\nBut you are using Code::Blocks, so you'll have to add SDL_bgi and SDL2 to something like 'Link Libraries' in the project parameters.\nIf you have some non-crossplatform includes, then surround them with ifndef __linux__ directives:\n#ifndef __linux__\n#include <conio.h>\n#include <dos.h>\n#endif /* __linux__ */\n\n", "Q: Wifi not working in ubuntu 15.04 Yesterday I have made some updates and upgraded my linux 14.10 to linux 15.04..

It came from the manufacturer with Ubuntu Linaro 12.04 LTS (kernel 3.0.35).  I need a lot of serial ports, so I got the Syba 8 port PCIe card with the Exar XR17V358 chipset to go with it.  When I attempted to install the driver from the Exar website, I get an error:\nmake -C /lib/modules/'uname -r'/build SUBDIRS=/home/linaro/Desktop/exar modules\nmake: *** /lib/modules/3.0.35/build: No such file of directory.

If not, what else causes this issue?\n\nA: There are two errors shown in your details section log.  The first one at the very top (\"fatal: $HOME not set\") is due to git not knowing your $HOME directory after privilege escalation, and prior to the commit (before the VirtualBox install).  This can be fixed by adding the following near the top of the file /etc/etckeeper/pre-install.d/50uncommitted-changes:\nif [ \"$HOME\" = \"\" ]; then\n    export HOME=\"/root\"\nfi\n\nYou may want to commit this change with:\ncd /etc\nsudo git add etckeeper/pre-install.d/50uncommitted-changes\nsudo git commit -m \"Set $HOME if it is blank\"\n\nThe second error (\"*** Please tell me who you are...\"), near the bottom, is also caused by git, and can be fixed by setting the user name and email for the /etc/ repo owner:\ncd /etc\nsudo git config user.name \"Your Name\"\nsudo git config user.email \"your@email.com\"\n\nI had seen the same issues with my daily updates (on Ubuntu 14.04), however, they stopped showing up after I made these changes.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can't get audio in rear speakers in most multichannel audio formats I'm using Intel's on-board audio (ALC892 Analog) and it works fine, it can output non-surround sounds into rear speakers. However, when I try to play a movie with an 5.1 audio track, or a standalone audio file with 5.1 channels, I'm either don't get sound in the rear speakers or get the wrong sound (it mixes front channels into the back).\nI've tried the pre-installed video player, Kodi and VLC, And the results are the same. In VLC by setting output to Alsa and choosing 7.1 channels, I've managed to get correct sound in rear speakers with the test audio file, however in that configuration, the center and sub-woofer were silent.\nI've also tried to edit a pulseaudio config file, swapping rear and mid speakers in the 7.1 profile, to no avail.\nAnd the most odd thing: with DTS codec I get proper sound from the rear speakers, but not with FLAC and AAC.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I've managed to get it work.\nThe problem wasn't with Linux, Alsa or PulseAudio, the problem was with my setup.\nMy PC is capable of 7.1 audio on-board, but I have an 5.1 speaker set directly hooked into my computer (analogue out). Also, under Windows, real sound from the rear speakers only heard if I plug the rear jack into the side plug. Under Ubuntu, Alsa or pulse correctly recognizes my machine's 7.1 capability and assumes that I have a 7.1 speaker system. The speakers are recognized correctly, but real surround rear stream is flowing into the side speakers, instead of rear, even if choose the 5.1 analogue output in the sound settings applet. Then rear speakers are mapped as side speakers.\nTo get real surround sound, I've also had to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Totem Media Player to 5.1 output Edit | Settings | Sound tab\n\n*Install the Pulse Audio Volume Control. (sudo apt-get install pavucontrol) and adjust the side speaker's volume. Real surround sound, especially the rear channels, is usually low volume. It's recommended to first start the movie/audio and seek to a loud part before you do this, though.\n\n*Also, you have to adjust volume in the output tab, because you can only adjust rear speakers there. \n\n*DO NOT touch the regular volume control indicator while pavucontrol is running, or even after you ran it. it'll behave erratically!\n\n\nEdit 15 aug 2015: Since then, I've mustered the courage and plugged the rear speakers' jack into the correct plug, and set mode to 5.1. It works flawlessly with the test file. The problem was with 7.1 mode with rear speakers plugged into the side plug is that that in that mode side speakers gets a mixed channel from the front and back channels via pulse. With this physical correction, Ubuntu's sound settings applet also becomes more useful, so you may not need pavucontrol.\n\nA: Open alsamixer in a terminal:\nalsamixer\n\npress F6 and select your sound card by using the arrow keys and then press ENTER. \nThe first thing you need to do is turn automute off (use the arrow keys) and then find the back speaker and increase the volume. Press Esc to exit the alsamixer.\n", "Q: Installing QtCurve on 15.04 with KDE5 I installed Ubuntu 15.04 with KDE5.

If there are multiple with the same starting with the current search, it will chose the first by current sorting (alphabetically by default).\nThen there is the real search, to search the folder and all files / folders in it:\n\nTo access this, click the search icon, in the top bar.\nHere, you are searching \"Home\" by default. You want to search a different folder, so there are 2 ways to get that:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to search from the root directory, all the computer (/) click All Files.\n\n*If you want to search a certain folder, navigate there and then use the search tool.\nYour question sounds like you want to search everywhere (although I'm not sure why). So click the All Files at the top, or click Computer at the side, and then do your search.\n\nAs an alternative, install nemo:\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nIt is based on the same code as nautilus, but may work when nautilus doesn't.\n\nA: To make nautilus search all files, simply avoid clicking \"All Files\".\nSo nautilus search does indeed work, its the \"All Files\" button that does not.\n-update- I can not reproduce this. The / always becomes \"Home\" and the \"All Files\" button active.  I am using Nemo instead of Nautilus now.

These are different and usually it's better to use bash in cron jobs.\nBash is a superset of sh, meaning everything you can do in sh you can also do in bash and bash has more features than sh.\nIn Ubuntu sh symlinks to dash, not to bash.\nFurthermore you can execute this cronjob as root to be sure that the permissions are right.\n", "Q: Launching different kernels I have compiled a Real-time Patched Kernel on my Linux Box. I usually run Ubuntu 14.04.\nOn Debian, at bootup, one is given a list of kernels which are installed in the system. One chooses a specific kernel from this list. \nHow does one do the same in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu has GRUB as well as debian. If it doesn't show, press and hold Shift (or maybe Esc) just after the BIOS screen. It will look like this:\n\nThen you can choose which kernel, after selecting \"Advanced option for Ubuntu\".\n\n", "Q: Display offset. See image I am using Ubuntu 14.04, but I have installed the package lubuntu-desktop. Everything was fine till one day, the screen went offset. You can see the grey background at the sides . Windows can only be maximized as much as the desktop background. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: Same problem here, just solved. It's actually quite simple, just didn't think about it.\nJust right click over the grey area, you should read something like \"close this panel\" (translation might not be accurate because I use the italian version of this distro), click on that and the screen automatically \nresizes. \nI don't know how I managed to create the problem first though.\n\nA: Have you installed openbox as your window-manager? If you haven't install it, as well as obconf, obmenu, and possibly lxsession-edit. The configuration files are in /etc/xdg/openbox dir.\nCheck and see if you have a $HOME/.config/openbox directory, and whats in that directory, by running the following commands:\n:~$ stat $HOME/.config/openbox\n\n:~$ ls $HOME/.config/openbox\n\nIf you don't have have the directory, create it, and copy everything from /etc/xdg/openbox to that directory.\nIn the case that the directory ($HOME/.config/openbox) doesn't exist, yet you have openbox installed run these commands:\n:~$ mkdir -p -m0755 $HOME/.config/openbox\n\n:~$ sudo bash\n\n:~# cp -rf /etc/xdg/openbox/* $HOME/.config/openbox/\n\n:~# chown -R yourusername:yourusername $HOME/.config/openbox\n\n:~# exit\n\nNOTE: you should have that directory, and there should be a file titled\nlubuntu-rc.xml in that directory.\nNow you can edit your moving and resizing options, as well as your margins options via the $HOME/.config/lubuntu-rc.xml, or the openbox configuration manager. You might also be able to do this with lxsession-edit. \nBut as you can tell, the DE is not finding (or setting) the dimensions of your screen properly at startup, therefore is not centering itself.\nBasically how it works, the code uses some simple math, subtraction of coordinates off the x and y axis, using a few built in functions and the total x,y pixel length of your screen's size; to get centered. So yours has gonna screwy because your configuration got mangled somehow. \nThis could also be because you made changes to the SystemSettings>Display, most notably it has occurred while connecting a machine to another Monitor with different dimensional specs (e.g. laptop to Flatscreen TV with a hdmi cable).\nAs a possible debugging test:\nWhen you boot, on the top panel of the lubuntu login manager, on the right side there is icon that will allow to select openbox, as well as lubuntu-netbook. Play with these options (login into each one) to see if the issue is occurring across the board on all of the openbox derivatives (the DE's that use openbox as the window manager). \n", "Q: Ubuntu & UEFI - GRUB console after boot (Boot Repair output included) I still have the problem with booting Ubuntu on UEFI based laptop (Dell XPS 13, the newest one)\nAfter booting all I can see is a Grub2 console. I tried Boot Repair, but it hasnt helped me at all.\nHere is the output that Boot Repair gives: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11572310/\nI know that there IS a possibility of installing Ubuntu on this laptop, but fail at every try.\nThe \"place to install bootloader\" was the main disc - /dev/sda.\nThanks for any advice!\n\nA: Since Boot Repair doesn't seem to have worked, the next option is my own rEFInd boot manager. It can boot a Linux kernel directly and needs little or nothing in the way of configuration files (unlike GRUB, which requires a very complex configuration file, which is what's not working for you). Download a USB flash drive or CD-R image from the rEFInd downloads page, prepare a boot medium, and try booting it. (You'll probably have to disable Secure Boot, if you haven't done so already -- your Boot Repair output indicates it is disabled, but you may have re-enabled it.) rEFInd should show you options to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. (For Ubuntu, rEFInd will likely show options for both GRUB and direct boots of your kernels.) Try them both. If any of the Ubuntu options works, you can install rEFInd via its PPA or Debian package and you should be good to go. If rEFInd fails, post back with details of what went wrong.\n\nEDIT: Oh, wait, I just noticed that you're using XFS. That will complicate things with rEFInd. Pete Batard's EFI driver package includes an XFS driver. You could add that to the rEFInd USB flash drive and it might work, but I make no promises about that. Switching to ext4fs or Btrfs would give rEFInd a better chance of working, but of course that will require re-installing.\nIf you do re-install, do so in EFI mode from the start. Installing one OS in EFI mode and the other in BIOS mode is an exercise in pain. Your Windows is in EFI mode, so you should install Ubuntu in EFI mode, too.\n", "Q: Duplicate icons of an application, running in Wine I am running Ubuntu 15.04 and Docky as my launcher. To run OriginPro under Wine from launcher I created a .desktop file and pinned it to my Docky\nHowever, when it starts, it opens a separate icon (which I can't pin to Docky by right-click). I had a similar problem with Matlab (not wine), but changing the .desktop file's name to exactly match the one that opens when I click on it made them group, but it doesn't work for OriginPro. \n\nA: This happens (not only) with Wine applications. I assume your application does not have a duplicated launcher, since you cannot pin it to the Unity Launcher (or Docky in your case). The second icon will most likely be a generic one, or a \"general\" Wine icon.\nThe second icon appears because the launcher and the application window do not \"meet\" each other.\nWhat to do\n\n\n*\n\n*Open OriginPro\n\n*Open a terminal, type the command xprop WM_CLASS + return, the cursor will change into a big +.\n\n*Click on the window of OriginPro, in the terminal you will find an output like:\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"finale.exe\", \"Wine\"\n\n(In the example of Finale, your output will be different)\n\n*Open your .desktop file, add a line, starting with StartupWMClass=, + the section of the output, identifying your application, like (again the Finale example):\nStartupWMClass=finale.exe\n\nNow your application launcher is \"connected\" to the application:\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Black Screen on Resume-After-Lid-Close I've been struggling with this one for a while.

When I first installed Ubuntu, my custom desktop would suspend just fine, but it wouldn't come out of it to a functional desktop. Some time after rebuilding my system with new hardware, it started working. If I recall correctly, Ubuntu 14.04 is what made it so my computer would suspend and resume correctly. However, on my work computer, an HP Compaq something-or-other also running Ubuntu 14.04, I haven't had any luck with suspend.\nBasically, in my experience, Ubuntu sometimes has trouble correctly interfacing with a computer's hardware when it comes to sleeping and resuming. It is completely possible that there is a way to fix such compatibility issues, but I don't know enough to generate a solution, and I may not know enough to comfortably implement such a solution. Unfortunately, that's the best answer I can give, but it's totally possible that some Linux guru may see your problem and come up with a solution.\n\nA: It's very late but people can still have the problem.

Here is what it said exactly:\nFailed to fetch http://ports.ubuntu.com/{package name}  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.88.140 80]\nAfter it completely fails at trying to install chromium, it then tells me that it failed to fetch some archives, and that I should try apt-get update or try with --fix-missing. These did not work. I tried following the guide here: https://smyl.es/how-to-fix-ubuntudebian-apt-get-404-not-found-package-repository-errors-saucy-raring-quantal-oneiric-natty/?doing_wp_cron=1433464178.3783519268035888671875\nBut none of these methods worked. I also tried to install Java, but with the same results. I eventually decided to make an account here and ask a question myself. Now I have. If anyone can help me, and if anyone could tell me a tad more about the forum, that would be appreciated.\nOne more thing, these are the things I am using for linux:\nUbuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander)\nLinuxOnAndroid's SMALL ubuntu .img for ARM\nThat's about it\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) is in End of Life. And so there are no packages available anymore. You should either upgrade to the current release (15.04 Vivid Vervet at time of writing or 14.04.2 for LTS) by running do-release-upgrade or try a different image which is still supported like 14.04 Trusty Tahr or 12.04 Precise Pangolin\n\nA: I voted up Germar for the answer, because that could be possible, I had the same thing occur while using RaringRingtail. But I do not know when saucy's EndOfLife is. Ubuntu 13.10 SaucySalamander was not a long-term-supported (LTS) version of Ubuntu, and non LTS versions are merely rolling releases to the next rolling-release or long-term-supported version. \nLong story short, your problem is more than likely occurring because they shut the SaucySalamander servers down. If that is not the reason inspect your /etc/apt/sources.list file and see if for some reason there is a mistake with your url's. It should look something like this:\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates main restricted\n\nIf the url's are commented out:\n# deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates main restricted\n# deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates main restricted\n\nThen it is merely a problem with your /etc/apt/sources.list file and just remove the comments and retry. \nMore than likely Germar is correct and you should perform the do-release-upgrade.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Meizu MX4 Ubuntu edition not mounting as USB drive and not available to adb My Meizu MX4 Ubuntu edition arrived this week and I'm figuring out how to use it.

I love creating hotkeys to open programs and menus, but sometimes I can't figure out what the command for something is.

(Which doesn't mean there isn't) Sometimes it's quite easy to find a command, sometimes it isn't. E.g. when looking at the process list, Google Chrome shows up as /opt/google/chrome/chrome, but it is required to start the browser with /usr/bin/google-chrome. So here are some methods which can help you.\n\nWhen dealing with an UI application, you can run xprop | grep WM_CLASS, and then click on the window in question. This may give you some hints for the executable name, such as\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"gnome-system-monitor\", \"Gnome-system-monitor\"\n\n\nAlso, you can use the default file browser, navigate to /usr/share/applications and search for the icon of the program. Then right click it, select \"Open with\" and select a text editor. This launcher file will contain a line like:\nExec=/usr/bin/gnome-system-monitor\n\n\nIf you happen to know the name of the package the program was shipped with, you can use dpkg to look up the files shipped with this package using the -L switch. Also grepping for terms like \"bin\" can be of help:\n$ dpkg -L gnome-system-monitor | grep bin\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/gnome-system-monitor\n\n\nA: I also found out that you can look programs up in the repositories to find the terminal command.\n\nThe text after \"version\" before the first space is the terminal command for this program.\n", "Q: Starting a program in a Screen session via SSH Okay, there are a few similar topics to this one, but what I want to do is run a program in a screen session on a remote computer.\nTaking my lead from this thread\nIn the hope that it is correct, I am entering the command:\nssh  remote@192.168.1.5 \"screen -S test -d -m roslaunch startup startup_node\"\n\nwhich neither starts a new screen session \"test\" or runs my script \"roslaunch startup startup_node\"\nI can create a remote session \"test\":\nssh  remote@192.168.1.5 \"screen -S test -d -m\"\n\nBut how can I then run a command in it? How is the screen -X command used with a named screen?\nI have tried, based on this :\n ssh remote@192.168.1.5 \"screen -X stuff \"roslaunch startup startup_node^M\" \"\n\nbut again it doesn't seem to start the process remotely. Both commands work if you are already ssh'd into the remote.\nI've also tried to write a script startnav.sh on my remote machine that contains  screen -S nav -d -m roslaunch startup startup_node\nand I run it by:\nssh remote@192.168.1.5 -t \"./startnav.sh\"\n\nThis creates the screen instance however it is dead as in the following output\n    ~$ ssh swarmbot2@192.168.1.5 -t screen -r nav\n     There is a screen on:\n            4506.nav    (04/06/15 12:30:09) (Dead ???)\n     Remove dead screens with 'screen -wipe'.\n     There is no screen to be resumed matching nav.\n     Connection to 192.168.1.5 closed.\n\nFinally, I've followed the question here\nand can get normal bash commands to execute, just not 'roslaunch startup startup_node'\nfor instance \nssh -f remote@192.168.1.5  \"screen -dm -S nav htop \"\n\nwill launch a htop session in a separate screen on a remote machine. The -f flag seems to be important. But still doesn't work for a roslaunch or a script that contains roslaunch even though it does work if run without ssh. Additionally, for a temporal program such as sleep 10, the screen will only exist until that script is completed executing.\n\nA: As in the final example in the question the problem was not with the ssh or screen environment other than several ROS-specific environment variables were not set up. This was due to ~/.bashrc not being called on the remote, which set them up for me. \nOnce I included the setup of specific environment variables namely  \nsource /ros/devel/setup.sh\n\nthe system worked correctly.\nScript File startnav.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.sh\nroslaunch startup startup_node.launch\n\nAnd the call to load the script file:\nssh remote@192.168.1.5 -f \"screen -S nav -dm ./startnav.sh\"\n\n", "Q: Where can I install ubuntu if I have 4 primary partitions? I want to triple boot Windows 7, Backtrack, and Ubuntu. Windows and Backtrack are already installed. The problem is that both of them take 4 partitions: 3 for Windows, and 1 for Backtrack. When I try to make another partition, it says I can't have over 4. How can I install Ubuntu with this problem? Note: The 3 Windows partitions are PQSERVICE, SYSTEM RESERVED, and eMachines. I don't really know if I can delete one.\n\nA: Hard drives are indeed limited to 4 primary partitions. Luckily for us multi-booters, if you create an extended partition, it can serve as a container for additional primary partitions. The problem is, since an extended partition counts as a primary partition, if you've already hit the limit, you would need to remove a partition and recreate it within a new extended partition. Since you said that your partition manager complained, it looks like you've hit that limit. So, my best advice is to see if you can safely delete and recreate one of your partitions. Your best option may be to do so with Backtrack's partition. If you have a spare hard drive, you could probably clone that partition to it and restore it back onto a new partition within your extended partition.\nUnfortunately, that's the only solution I know of. More experienced guys can probably give some more insight, but hopefully this will prove helpful at least for now. Best of luck to you!\n\nA: You have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert from a BIOS-mode to an EFI-mode installation. This will also convert from the limited MBR partition table to the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT), which raises the 4-partition limit to 128 partitions. The trouble is that converting Windows from MBR/BIOS to GPT/EFI is tricky; you may need to re-install. Also, older computers are BIOS-only; EFI became common only with new machines delivered in mid-2011 and later.\n\n*Convert one or more existing partitions from primary to logical form. This can be done with my Fixparts program, which is installed in the Ubuntu gdisk package. There are caveats to its use -- see its documentation for details. Chances are you can convert Backtrack to boot from a logical partition relatively painlessly. Once you've converted one partition, you should be able to create additional logical partitions, although you'll have to resize and perhaps move partitions to get it all done. DO NOT convert the Windows boot partition; it must boot from a primary partition.\n\n*Get another hard disk. This is the safest way to get another OS installed. If your computer is a laptop or really tiny one (like an Intel NUC), you might need to use an external disk.\n\n\nThose are all the options that spring to mind and that I recommend. Which is best depends on your specific needs.\n", "Q: Duplex printing, Brother DCP 7065DN, (K)ubuntu 14.10 How can I do duplex printing on a Brother DCP-7065DN printer in Kubuntu 14.10?

The\nquestion pertains to the 'who' command, and its output. On previous editions of Ubuntu the output the who command would read what tty was used to login and initiate the system and lightdm, for example:\n:~$ who\ngeo      tty7     thedate (:0)\ngeo      pts/n    thedate (:0.0)\n\nBut on 14.04 TrustyTahr, when I run the who command my output yields:\n:~$ who\ngeo      :0       thedate (:0)\ngeo      pts/n    thedate (:0.0)\n\nOn both editions the vt7 handoff is happening in /boot, and on TrustyTahr\nmy XDG_VTNR variable is 7 when I login via lightdm; but tty7, nor vt7 is \nprinted to the utmp file. This annoyed me for months, I finally wrote a c++ program, that incorporates the popen function, as a supplement to the who command in order for the who command to display the current XDG_VTNR with a tty coefficient e.g.:\ngeo      tty7         2015-06-04 20:54 (:0)\ngeo      pts/0        2015-06-04 20:54 (:0.0)\n\nNone the less why has this changed? And also is mine the only one like that, cause I downloaded this around May of last year, and I might have gotten a bunk iso or something, everytime I run the who command it makes me think of that Beastie Boys song: Sabotage (jk its not the bad).\n\nA: Try upgrading the package that contains the who command; even if you did use a strange version of the ISO to install from, an update should replace it:\nFind out what package owns who:\nwhich who    # find out where 'who' binary is\ndpkg -S /path/to/who\n\nThen:\napt-get update\napt-get install <package name from dpkg -S command>\n\nIf it still doesn't work, try a different shell with no environment (to get rid of any wonky environment variables, setups, bash-specific junk, etc.):\nenv -i /bin/dash\n$ who\n\nIf it works in a bare shell, then the problem is likely a weird alias definition in a bashrc, or something similar.\nAlso, does who --all work?\n", "Q: Audio Card can't be found I had a similar problem as this person.

I.E. when I boot up a computer, I want to put in my username and password and have access to the same files/configuration as if I logged onto the other computer.  I need to have about 5 different sets of users on this network.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: Sounds like you would need an authentication service that works for both Linux and Windows and then a way to share files across either Windows or Linux with your home directory mounted automatically (potentially on login) and a roaming profile shared out for the windows machine.\nFile sharing is the easy part.  Samba and NFS.  NFS to share files to the Linux machine and Samba to share files to the windows machine.  Though you could use Samba for both, I guess.\nAs a starting point, you could check out Open LDAP for authentication.\nI'm not sure about configuring the windows machine to authenticate against LDAP, perhaps you have to use samba for that, too... otherwise you may have to install additional software in windows to enable it to authenticate against LDAP (such as pGina).\nThere are various guides with varying levels of user-friendliness.\nI hope this is a starting point, at least.  I've not had to do this sort of set up in a very long time, so I'm afraid I wont be of much help other than what little info I've provided here.\n", "Q: How to deploy Openstack HA with services inside lxcs? I am trying to deploy Openstack in HA environment where there are 3 nodes(controllers) which have charms deployed inside lxcs but I am having difficulty in deploying the charms inside lxcs on specific nodes. \nI would like to deploy 3 units of a charm inside lxcs. i.e. juju deploy -n 3 rabbitmq-server \nIs there any way I can use the --to flag for this?\ni.e. juju deploy -n 3 rabbitmq-server --to lxc:0 lxc:1 lxc:2\n\nA: When using --to, you can't specify -n, sorry. You have to run the command once for each unit, like in a for loop.\n\nA: First of all you need to make sure that your containers are running: lxc-ls --fancy. If not start them with lxc-start -n lxc:0 --daemon \nThen you need to jump into each container with lxc-attach -n lxc:0, make sure you have OpenstackHA installed and running in each one of them (yes, that means installing it 3 times and wasting some bandwidht and disk space)\nOnce this is done you can do your Openstack stuff for which I admitedly can not help you much.\n\nA: If the units have to be places on specific nodes then do not use the num-units flag (-n).\nInstead deploy the first unit using the command:\n\njuju deploy  rabbitmq-server --to lxc:0\n\nThen add-units accordingly:\n\njuju add-unit rabbitmq-server --to lxc:1\njuju add-unit rabbitmq-server --to lxc:2\n\n", "Q: How to create custom resolution How do I input custom resolution in the nvdidia xserver settings?

Then on next boot it will use your modified rules instead of what used to be in there.\nI'm guessing the location is /etc/iptables.rules, but to find yours grep -R iptables-restore /etc/init.d/.\nOnce you know that file, you can modify your live rule set and then save a good set with the following command as root:\niptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\n\nOr, as a normal user via sudo:\niptables-save | sudo tee -a /etc/iptables.rules\n\nYou may even want to save off the current rules to a file, edit the file by hand, and then reload from this file.  For example:\nsudo iptables-save > edited-rules\nvim edited-rules #or whatever editor, gedit?\nsudo iptables-resore < edited-rules\n\nHowever you do it, be sure that when you are done, you save the new ruleset to whatever the file is in etc (again, probably /etc/iptables.rules)\n", "Q: How can I install Iceweasel in Ubuntu 15.04?

Any comments? This does not solve the lowercase hex question.\n\nA: I suspect that the warning you're seeing is a red herring. The Boot000a is not EFI 1.10 compliant (lowercase hex in name) and related messages are clearly marked as warnings, not errors. (In computers, a \"warning\" is almost always a notification to users that something is sub-optimal or that it might cause problems in some situations, whereas an \"error\" denotes a show-stopping problem.) Note that your example output includes the following statement:\nInstallation finished. No error reported.\n\nIn other words, everything should be working; the warnings have not prevented installation of GRUB.\nI've also tried to track down what's causing the warnings, and it's the efibootmgr utility:\nhttp://efibootmgr.sourcearchive.com/documentation/0.5.4-2ubuntu1/efibootmgr_8c-source.html\nThe code that generates the warning does nothing but display the warning message; it does not set flags that would have other follow-on negative effects.\nThat said, it's conceivable that some follow-on program, such as the GRUB binary, might also have problems with lowercase hexadecimal numbers, not generate a warning, but fail when it sees them. That seems unlikely, though; AFAIK, GRUB doesn't consult the EFI Boot#### variables, so if GRUB is launching, you're probably past the point where they should matter.\nAnother point about this is that the names of the boot options with lowercase hexadecimal numbers suggests that they were created by your firmware. Thus, even if you were to delete those boot options, they or other options with lowercase hexadecimal numbers might be (re-)created by the firmware in the future. The warning says that the values are not compliant with EFI 1.10, but most modern computers ship with EFI 2.x (aka UEFI). Thus, the warning should matter only on these older EFIs.\nThis brings me to the real heart of the matter: You've described the scary-but-probably-red-herring warning, but you haven't described what the actual problem is, at least not in enough detail to be useful. You note that you lost the ability to boot after you updated some packages, but that's a very vague description of the problem. Does GRUB come up at all? If GRUB comes up, does it show a menu? If GRUB tries to launch a kernel, does it hang, and if so, what type of output appears first? You mentioned use of rEFInd, but did it enable you to boot Linux any better? If not, what symptoms appeared when you booted with rEFInd? The answers to these questions are critical to solving your actual problem. I suggest you post a new question with this information and pay less attention to the (apparently harmless) efibootmgr warning.\n", "Q: Notify me for voice when I am wearing headphones I keep listening to music with my headphones all day and there are people who keep calling me but it does not always work for them.

It's mostly working, except when I do a shutdown or reboot, it doesn't actually turn off the power after quitting everything:\n\nSo I have to click the power button to actually turn it off.\n\nI've kept the Windows 8.1 installation in case there's any future firmware. Before installing Xubuntu, I turned off Fastboot from Windows, then installed Xubuntu. Unfortunately, the UEFI BIOS didn't let me change boot order so that Ubuntu actually started as default. I tried bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi, tried turning off \"quickboot\" (whatever that is) in BIOS, tried the Boot-Repair program from a Live Session, and tried turning off SecureBoot, but still it would just boot Windows. I ended up, with the help of EricC^^ of #ubuntu on freenode, just switching around the .efi files to trick the boot manager into thinking Ubuntu was Windows:\ncp /boot/efi/efi/boot/bootx64.efi{,.backup}\ncp /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi{,.backup}\ncp /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/efi/boot/bootx64.efi\ncp /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi\ncp /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/grubx64.efi\nsudo vim /usr/lib/os-probes/mounted/efi/20microsoft\n# and changed bootmgfw.efi to bootmgfw.efi.backup\nupdate-grub\n\nI don't know if any of this has a bearing on the shutdown trouble.\nEDIT: Come to think of it, the reboot from the Xubuntu installation (when I was booted through a USB drive) didn't work either.\n\nWhat I've tried so far to get it to shut down:\n\n\n*\n\n*acpi=off → no difference\n\n*acpi=force → no difference\n\n*install proprietary Nvidia drivers → that just made X not start with the message \"bbswitch: No discrete VGA device found\"\n\n*various variations on sudo poweroff, sudo shutdown now, sudo shutdown -h now etc.\n\n\n\nAlso, if I reboot instead of shutdown, I get this psychedelic lightshow on my monitor and have to long-click the power button to turn it off:\n\nIf it's helpful, here's a journalctl --all output right after booting up and perhaps even better: journalctl -b -1 (journal from bootup to shutdown).\n\nAlso, perhaps related, I notice now that pressing the power button while logged in to XFCE turns the computer right off, even though I have XFCE power settings to \"Ask when power button pressed\" and \"Do nothing\" on any other buttons.\nMy /etc/systemd/logind.conf has no uncommented lines apart from the [Login] header. \nThere is a /usr/sbin/acpid process running as root.\n\nEDIT: More revelations: Ctrl+Alt+Delete actually reboot fine from GRUB.\nEDIT2: I've filed a bug report since this doesn't seem fixable with the regular tricks.\nEDIT3: Solved with acpi=noirq and kernel 4.4 and newer.\n\nA: Try adding\nacpi=noirq\n\nto the kernel boot parameters. This lets it poweroff on shutdown/restart (tested with kernels 4.4 and 4.7rc5). \nIt seems to suspend too, but unfortunately does not resume from suspend on pressing the power button.\nThis has worked fine for over three months now on the A740, so I'm calling this solved.\n\nA: My best guess based on the info provided is a buggy UEFI BIOS. digging through the kernel bugs for Haswell I found a possible workaround. Try using xhci_hcd.quirks=262144 as a boot option or Disabling xhci in the UEFI.\nThe only other options I can think of are as follows:\nA) Wait and hope that either the kernel development team or Lenovo comes up with an update that resolves the problem.\nB) Contact Lenovo Support and push for a BIOS update that resolves the problem or encourage others with the same problem to subscribe to your bug report. This may or may not be any more effective than A.\nC) Modify the BIOS or the kernel yourself until you reach the desired result (Not for the faint of heart). I'm not recommending this course of action, only including it for completeness. Modifying the BIOS can easily leave you with an unbootable system with a voided warranty. You should also read carefully the reasons for and against compiling your own kernel in the aforementioned linked document.\nSource: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66171#c118\n\nA: After ferreting through the system files I saw a few warning about the BIOS. I checked Intel's website and there was an upgrade available that seemed to solve an issue of overlapping memory addresses. Not obviously the same but my logs indicated that various sectors of my BIOS were returning unexpected values, which did not prevent the kernel from starting but obviously was not good. The issue was not apparent until the kernel stopped using upstart and started using systemd.\nI downloaded the updated BIOS and applied it and now my system turns off as expected.\n\nA: What cat /etc/default/halt says? Try halt -p.\nYou can also edit /etc/init.d/halt and remove this lines:\nif [ \"$INIT_HALT\" = \"HALT\" ]\nthen\n  poweroff=\"\"\nfi\n\nbelow\npoweroff=\"-p\"\n\n\nA: From your Kernel Logs (Screenshot) I have a hunch that unattended-upgrades might be the cause of your issue. There have been several bug reports on this years ago, but they have not been resolved. A temporary fix to this would be to disable automatic updates by updates, but we will keep it as a last resort. But first of all, we will try a manual upgrade:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf this did not solve your issue, and the upgrade went without any errors or warnings, wee will try digging a bit more deep to see if we can find out what is causing the issue. You could get a lead by inspecting the contents of /var/log/unattended-upgrades. If you could figure out which update is causing the issue, you could blacklist the update by modifying /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades. \nIf it still does not solve the issue, you can temporarily  remove the package, to confirm if it is the cause:\nsudo apt-get remove unattended-upgrades \n\nI recommend that you reinstall it even if it solved your issue. If this is the case bring back the the bug report with more information so that the developers can solve your issue.\nWarning: If you choose to disable automatic update and then don't manually update your system, you may be at risk from security and stability view point. \n\nA: I tried everything and after days a lowly rated fanswer from this forum did the trick: Ubuntu 14.04 stuck on shutdown\n\nFor me, the solution was to upgrade the kernel. I used 4.5.3 on Ubuntu\n  15.10 (anything greater than this will crash the OS after login) And 4.7 RC3 works on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nNow works perfectly :-)\n\nA: I can confirm it definitely has something to do with ACPI. My system exhibits this exact behaviour if and only if I pass acpi=off in Linux 4.20-rc3 for kernel development purposes. If your ACPI was enabled at first, then there is a fair chance that the ACPI implementation in the BIOS was buggy. I see you said a kernel upgrade helped. But a BIOS upgrade may have done the trick, also.\n\nA: I have had the same problem and believe that it is related to the UEFI boot. On an Acer Aspire V 11, originally Windows 8, I have done a fresh install of OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 with EFI boot and secure boot set to \"disabled\" in the BIOS. Now the shutdown, reboot and suspend work correctly.\nPreviously, I was using Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and most recently 18.10 under legacy boot and they all suffered the same problem. I also tried Fedora 24, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and OpenSUSE 42.2, all with the same problem.\nI also tried Ubuntu 18.10 with EFI boot and secure boot enabled but got a non-bootable device error. I did not try EFI boot with secure boot disabled.\n\nA: We bought a cheap mini-pc with Intel board for a project. It was shipped with Win7, I reinstalled Debian 10 for deep customization in the project. On every reboot/poweroff, it has a high chance to stuck at the end of poweroff stage with systemd's \"Watchdog didn't stop\" as the last message.\nI checked the BIOS setup screen, there is an option, to specify system type. Win7/Android/Win10. After switched to Android, it can reboot/poweroff without problem.\nPS: I did try reboot=pci reboot=bios parameters, but none of them worked. I wish I've checked BIOS for ACPI related settings ealier.\nHope this helps in some case.\n\nA: Your hardware might not support software shutdown.  I've had that happen before, and the way to test is this:\nsudo poweroff\n\nIf that does not shutdown the hardware, it's a hardware issue and not software.\n\nA: *\n\n*Restart then F2\n\n*Go to configuration and disable xHCI\n\n*Save and exit\n\n\nDon't think about it just trust me and do it :) \n", "Q: Pidgin can't connect to Facebook chat After some time, I tried to connect to my Facebook account with Pidgin.

below link :\nFacebook Chat Will Stop Working in Ubuntu This Week\n", "Q: How can I create a new blank file in an occupied directory? I am not experiencing the problem in How to create a new blank file in Nautilus 3.6 and above?, perhaps because I have a newer version of Nautilus.\n$ nautilus --version\nGNOME nautilus 3.14.2\n\nI can create a blank file very easily in most directories: find some blank space, right click, and select New Document » Empty Document. However, if a folder has enough content to fill the screen, there is no blank space. If I switch to icon mode, there is blank space between the icons, but in list mode there is no blank space anywhere. I don’t recall having this difficulty in the past. Right clicking in list mode used to work. Is there any way I can restore older behaviour?\n\nA: The easiest method is this keyboard combo: Alt+F, D, E.\n\nThis basically mimics Florian Diesch’s answer: Alt+F opens “File”, D opens “New Documents” and E is for “Empty Document”.\n\nA: If there is no blank space you have to use New Document » Empty Document from the File menu.\n\nA: The canonical command to create an empty file is indeed touch.\nFrom the command line, enter touch <filename(including full path)>.\n(Although, beware arguments containing spaces.)\n\nA: You could just use the cd command to move to your folder step by step from the terminal and then use any editor to create a file, such as\ncd Desktop/../..\nnano a\n\nThis opens \"a\" file. Just save the file by clicking Ctrl+o and exit with Ctrl+x. Two dots \"..\" is for parent directory.\n", "Q: Get specific PID and save to file I'm running two minecraft servers on my machine. I want to know what the pid is of a single mc server that is running and put it to file so that I can kill it later. So for this example I only want to know what the PID is of World2 nothing else and save it to file.\nWhen I perform a command \nps h -o pid,cmd -u minecraft \n\nI get the following results\n31416 /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java -Xmx2G -Xms1G -jar /data/mc-server/World1/minecraft_server.jar nogui\n31706 /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java -Xmx6G -Xms4G -jar /data/mc-server/World2/craftbukkit.jar nogui\n\nI then pipe to grep using this command\ngrep World2\n\nThis is where I get into difficulties, I then pipe to to get a single result back. I tried the following but just can't get it.\nawk '{print $1 > world2.pid}'\n\nSo my full command is:\nps h -o pid,cmd -u minecraft | grep World2 | awk '{print $1 > world2.pid}'\n\nI get the following error:\nawk: cmd. line:1: {print $1 > world2.pid}\nawk: cmd. line:1:                 ^ syntax error\n\n\nA: If you want to put the redirection inside awk, you need to put the filename in quotes - otherwise, awk treats it as a variable rather than a literal string:\n... | awk '{print $1 > \"world2.pid\"}'\n\nHowever it would be more conventional to let awk write to standard output, and redirect that i.e.\n... | awk '{print $1}' > world2.pid\n\nAlternatively, you may want to look at using pgrep for the whole task e.g. something like\npgrep -f 'World2' > world2.pid\n\n\nA: If you put the > world2.pid after awk '{print $1}', it should work:\nps h -o pid,cmd -u minecraft | grep World2 | awk '{print $1}' > world2.pid\n\nThen the output of:\nps h -o pid,cmd -u minecraft | grep World2 | awk '{print $1}'\n\nis written to:\nworld2.pid\n\nOR\nAs suggested (thanks) by @JonathanLeffler, you could save the usage of grep:\nps h -o pid,cmd -u minecraft | awk '/World2/ {print $1}' > world2.pid\n\n", "Q: probleme with vps connection device I bought a VPS with Ubuntu and I installed VNC and I would like to use a VPN account to change my IP address when I want.

After disabling nouveau drivers following this and rebooting, I needed to disable graphics with Ctrl+Alt+F1, login, and then stop lightdm\nsudo stop lightdm\n\nthen ran the installer .run file. Installation finished successfully. After installation finished I rebooted with:\nsudo  reboot\n\nBut after the reboot when I tried to login, the login page reappeared. I have tried almost all the solutions suggested here but nothing changes. More specifically I've tried correcting ownership of .Xauthority, .ICEauthority, and  .gvfs. I've tried removing .Xauthority and /tmp. I've tried reconfiguring lightdm with:\ndpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nand also tried removing and restarting lightdm. But nonof them has worked. What should I do?\n\nA: 1- First, you must uninstall nvidia packages. apt-get purge nvidia-*\n2- Try re-install ubuntu-desktop.\n3- Reconfigure lightdm package. (dpkg-reconfigure lightdm)\n4- Reboot\nIt must work, if not; try modprobe nouveau to load nouveau kernel module\n\nA: I also encounter the same problem. So I switch to TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and created a new user and found out that I can login using the new user. Then I realize that if I use the new user's $HOME/.profile, I can login too. Finally, the problem lies in the $HOME/.profile, LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\\*/cuda\\*:\\*/nvidia\\*:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nIt turns out that if your current graphics card is not compatible with the Nvidia driver or CUDA library, login will crash the X session. It seems like a bug in the gnome-session.\nYour case might be different though.\nMy problem now solved.\n\nA: Do you have an Intel Graphics on your machine? I had the same problem before (HD4600 + NV860M + Ubuntu 14.04), it was caused by overwriting the original opengl of Intel. I have solved the problem with --no-opengl-libs while running the runfile as described in the official documentation (the same as yours). \nI also suggest you to reboot to the pure text mode by changing the boot info while choosing the system. \nIf you have a similar laptop, you can refer to my another answer. I hope you can find your way out soon. I personnally have reinstalled Ubuntu a dozen of times for this, do not give up!\n\nA: Just wanted to add my five cents here.\nI was running a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04, after installing CUDA 9 I also got stuck in a login loop.\nAt first I also thought I made a mistake in updating the .profile but it turned out that UEFI secure boot was enabled in the BIOS. This caused 3rd party drivers not to be used. After disabling secure boot every thing worked fine.\n\nA: Actually, I have also encountered exactly the same problem before. After trying numerous ways, my final conclusion is that if you want to install CUDA using the .run file, do NOT install the bundled Nvidia graphics driver (type \"no\" when you see the prompt) in the .run file, just install the CUDA library (or maybe the sample code).\nIf you want to install the driver, follow the standard procedure below:\nsudo su\nadd-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers\napt-get update\napt-get install libcuda1-390 nvidia-390-dev nvidia-390 nvidia-libopencl1-390 nvidia-opencl-icd-390\n\nwhere the *-390 is to be replaced by the latest Nvidia driver version.\nI suspect there might be some post-installation scripts to be run after driver installation in order to make it work on X11 desktop. These scripts might not be present in the bundled .run file. You may want to check the X11 crash log at /var/log/Xorg.0.log as well.\n\nA: I still use Ubuntu 14.04, and my laptop has dedicated Nvidia GE-Force 920M and Intel i915 Hybrid GPU.\nI wanted to install CUDA (nvcc) for trying some HPC codes. So, I installed CUDA; following the official way. But, when I rebooted, I was facing the well known Login Loop Problem\nI tried all of these ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 login loop problem\nNothing really worked...\nFinally I was able to solve this problem by Un-Doing what I did earlier (which caused the login-loop). I uninstalled Nvidia drivers, and completely purged CUDA:\nUninstall just nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\nUninstall nvidia-cuda-toolkit and it's dependencies\nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\nPurging config/data\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\nor\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit \n\nI suggest you to find out what actually caused the problem, and trying to remove it completely might help you, instead of just blindly following all the solutions from Google.\n", "Q: IP Messenger not working in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Do anybody got success using IP Messenger in ubuntu 14.04 LTS ?\nI'm getting error while launching ip-messenger.\nFileName:ipmsg.c\nFunction:create_lock_file\nLine:157\nCan not setup lock file:/tmp/g2ipmsg.lock errno : -11 (Resource temporarily unavailable)\n\nWell, I can see g2ipmsg process using ps command:\nravi@dell:~$ ps -e | grep \"ipmsg\"\n9266 ? 00:02:33 g2ipmsg\n\nThat means, after process is running its just not showing in notification area, and so If i try to re-launch Ip Messenger from dock, its showing error because .lock file is already created at /tmp/g2ipmsg.lock by previous process and its being used.\nI've tried many solutions from other questions I've mentioned, but none of them worked for IP Messenger yet.\nI know, there something to do with gnome notification panel for allowing ip-messenger icon to appear behind system clock.

I have not come across this on other operating systems. Some one asked me to help them so I don't know your jargon\n\nA: The Dash is Ubuntu's equivalent of the start menu. From it you can do a lot of useful tasks. Here is an overview.\nPress Super to open it. You may know super as the \"Windows Key\" - it opens the start menu in Windows.\nWhen you open the dash you'll see an overview of recent programs and file / folder.\n\nYou can search just by typing, that will show Applications, Reference and shopping suggestions.

Back in the days on Windows, I used to format my disk used with Windows once a year or so. Would you recommend the same for Ubuntu?\n\nA: There never was a reason to format a disk in Windows unless for re-installing the OS or another OS. Defragmentation yes but that was inside Windows. Regarding the comment: people tended to format to get rid of malware in Windows but (to me) that is similar to blowing up the house to kill 1 mosquito. In general malware can be removed without a format but it was ofcourse the easiest method. We in general do not have malware (or it is installed deliberately by the user).\nThere is not really a need to format a disk on a regular base; when you re-install you can format but even then you can install the same OS without formatting. As long as you system does not go over 95% full there is also no reason to defrag the disk.  If you do reach 95% defragging is just a band-aid; you probably need a larger hard disk.\nSo no.  \n\nA: I have a slightly different opinion.\nFirstly, there were occasionally good reasons to reformat Windows. It slowed down if you installed things (including fonts). That wasn't fragmentation, it was just Windows being Windows. The registry on earlier versions could also get bogged down just through everyday use. And then there's malware.\nAnd I think some of those reasons exist in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching desktop environment leaves you with tonnes of duplicate apps and so much old config in your user directory.\n\n*Occasionally we break things and don't know how to fix them. Installing takes 20 minutes, learning how Upstart or the X stack work takes a couple of years.\n\n*And sometimes release upgrades just aren't as good as a fresh install. You'll upgrade and everything looks just a bit wrong. This is usually linked to major desktop changes, or things like that.\n\n\nSo yeah, sometimes it's nicer to reset to the \"factory default\", and much easier than trying to undo years of abuse.\nBut how often you need to do this will vary hugely. I do horrible things to my computers and servers so I tend to end up doing a fresh install on each every new LTS. A normal user might never get themselves in such a pickle.\n\nA: Formatting recreates the partitions on the hard drive.\nWhen would you do this?\n\nDisk formatting is preparing a storage device for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. The first part is \"low-level formatting\". Partitioning is the second part of the process, making the data storage device visible to an operating system. The third part of the process \"high-level formatting\" refers to the process of generating a new file system.\n\nSource, Wikipedia\nAs it says, it's typically for initial use - either the first time ever, or for a reinstallation. You might also do it if you've corrupted something, or have unwanted file (such as malware - which you probably won't get on Ubuntu).\nThis means there is no need to format yearly for Ubuntu - or any operating system. I can't think of any advantage to formatting yearly over leaving it - and reinstallation is a pain to me.\n", "Q: Ensure Services start on boot and perform an Security Audit I'm quite new to Ubuntu Server (14.04) and I need to make sure Nginx/php-fpm/MySQL start up automatically on boot. Where do I need to check to make sure they are set to start on boot and how to set them up to boot if needed?\nAlso which is the best way to perform a security audit on the server? Is there some software which will do this and produce a report?\n\nA: The simple test is rebooting but you can inspect how things are linked in quite easily.\nNginx uses an old-fashioned init script at /etc/init.d/nginx which is symlinked into various /etc/rc.n directories (which the system executes at boot). You can confirm:\n$ find /etc/rc?.d -iname '*nginx*' -exec file {} +\n/etc/rc0.d/K20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx' \n/etc/rc1.d/K20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx' \n/etc/rc2.d/S20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx' \n/etc/rc3.d/S20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx' \n/etc/rc4.d/S20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx' \n/etc/rc5.d/S20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx' \n/etc/rc6.d/K20nginx: symbolic link to `../init.d/nginx'\n\nThe other two use Upstart scripts at /etc/init/php5-fpm.conf and /etc/init/mysql.conf. Upstart is the main init engine in 14.04 so unless these have been edited, they should stay up.\nThe security audit is really dependant on what store and what you need. If you need simple PCI-DSS compliance, it's often easiest to farm it out to a third party which will scan your machine.\nBut that doesn't mean it's secure. Server security starts with SSH security but extends well through where you keep your data, what logs you retain, etc etc. There isn't an off-the-shelf answer for that; it's a manual slog through everything in the server.\nIf you don't know what you're doing in that respect, hire a pro. It's cheaper than the alternative.\n", "Q: Video Editing Performance?

The problem was the FILE CODEC. Smartphones often use H264 codec that are awful to decode on the fly, so preview will hang even with a decent hw. Ironically, a 100 Mb video file from a smartphone (LG G3 in my case) can be heavier to decode on the fly than a 1 Gb file encoded with Xvid (wich probably isn't the best option for a video edit, but at least prevents sluggishness). \n\nI'm stuck with the SAME problem! \nAnd I've got notable hw specs:\nXeon E3-1241v3 quad core 3.5\n16 Gb RAM 1600\nSSD\nVGA MSI GTX 970 oc\nI've tried EVERY editor available so it's not a sw-specific problem. \nI think it's a NVIDIA driver issue, or a kernel issue, or a OS issue. \nToo bad that pro video editing on Linux lacks a pretty decent solution because of structural problems. \n", "Q: Network Applet has disapeared after an update to 15.04 (unity interface) I can't see if I'm logged on my wifi lan or internet lan since I update my ubuntu to 15.04 (I use Unity interface).

If you have the DLL files installed in the appropriate location along with the program in question.\nIf you wish to build an application natively for Ubuntu, that was written using Windows controls from third party vendors, you would need to port your application to a portable toolkit framework such as Qt, and use the widgets provided within it, or using third party control widgets written for that toolkit, which can be used on Ubuntu (some proprietary ones may not be for example). You would also need to port any code using standard Windows controls over to the portable toolkit, and avoid using platform-specific calls. Alternatively (and possibly easier), you could write a new portable application based on these portable technologies, which is used for the same tasks, that would work on both Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: I installed the GUI twice I somewhere read and installed GPU which had asked me for a disk space of some 900Mb.
