["Q: My MacBook boots into recovery no matter what I select as a startup disk My MacBook no longer boots into macOS after I tried installing rEFInd. Instead, it always boots into recovery mode no matter which disk I select.\nBefore that (I know OS X El Capitan isn't officially supported on my MacBook), everything (except GPU Acceleration) was working great.\nI've tried booting into Safe Mode, running First Aid on Disk Utility and resetting the NVRAM and SMC without any luck and I can't reinstall macOS because I can't boot into the patched installer and the Installer from Recovery Mode isn't patched.\nI think that my bootloader isn't working properly after I tried installing rEFInd\nHere are the specs for my MacBook:\nModel identifier : MacBook2,1\nSystem : Patched OS X El Capitan\nCPU : Intel Core 2 Duo (64Bit)\nName : Late-2006 MacBook\n\nI want to at least boot into the installation medium, so I can reinstall macOS\nThe patcher I used for installing macOS/OS X El Capitan is RMC's OSX PATCHER\n\nA: I found that the EFI Partition was faulty and that I still can boot into my Debian 10 Live Medium so the solution was to reinstall macOS or to fix the EFI partition\nIn my case, I simply need to reinstall macOS/OS X Snow Leopard and then repatch the El Capitan installer and install and then, I'm done (Yes, I can just repair the EFI partition but I've erased my disk without doing it in purpose).\nIn the case of others, just reinstalling (without erasing anything) will fix the issue.\nI hope that everyone is doing well and that my answer helped.\nVitali64\n", "Q: MacOS Catalina change word delimiter language region setting I would like dash (-) to be considered a letter so if I double-click on\n1d18830d-0250-ee03-0c48-6ff9d89dfcff\nthe entire string is selected and not just one segment.\nIt seems you used to be able to select a English Language region:\nUnited States (Computer)\nto get that behavior but I don't see that choice in preferences anymore.\nIs there a way to add that region or copy the \"United States\" region and modify it for this?\nI'm currently running Catalina, but if this changes in Big Sur, tips for it would be welcome too.\nThanks\n\nA: To choose a region go to System Preferences and then to Language and Region.

An acceptable Answer would include giving support/documentation for the conclusion that Apple's claim (that the new M1 MacBook Pro has only \"65 (U.S.) or 66 (ISO) keys\") is an error, that new M1 MacBook Pro actually has 66 (U.S.) or 67 (ISO) keys, and that the only difference in keys is the 12 function keys.\n\nA: You can compare photos of the two keyboards here:\n\n\nHere we can see that the two keyboards have the same number of keys in the 5 lower rows of keys. The only difference being that the MacBook Air has 12 function keys where the MacBook Pro has the TouchBar.\nThe difference in Apple's technical specs I would attribute to Apple describing the power button (TouchID sensor) as a seperate key on the Air, whereas the Pro is is thought as a part of the TouchBar - even though it is physically separate (which is wasn't on earlier models).\n", "Q: \"sudo crontab -e\" not updating /etc/hosts In my /etc/hosts file, I have records like this:\n127.0.0.1    www.youtube.com\nTo keep me from getting distracted. When I need something on one of the sites I have blocked, I add # to the beginning of the line. Running this command, I can make it so all of the lines can be uncommented to remove access again:\nsudo sed -i '' 's/\\#//g' /etc/hosts\nTo automatically remove access, I run sudo crontab -e and add this line\n*/10 8-15 * * 1-5 sed -i '' 's/\\#//g' /etc/hosts\nI also tried with sudo crontab -e -u root\nAfter saving it, mac asks for permission for terminal to admin the machine, which I grant, and I figure it should be all good, but it doesn't see that the command is ever run (the file doesn't get updated). Is there something I need to do to get it to update the file?\n\nA: When you issue a command via cron, you need to specify the whole path, so instead, you should use /usr/bin/sed.\nThere are a couple other issues you should consider:\n\n*\n\n*cron is deprecated and this should be done using launchd instead\n\n\n*Why edit the file in place?  Simply save the original version of the hosts file  (i.e. /etc/hosts.orig) and create a new hosts file for when you want to block YouTube (i.e. /etc/hosts.nodistractions).  Just copy the appropriate file to /etc/hosts at the specified time interval.\nFor example, to unblock everything:\n  cp /etc/hosts.orig /etc/hosts\n\nTo go into \"no distraction mode\":\n  cp /etc/hosts.nodistractions /etc/hosts\n\nThe benefit of using this method is you can easily edit the file to add more hosts as your distractions evolve and you won't have to modify the code. Running this as a LaunchDameon executes this as root so there's no permission issues to really worry about.  You won't have to contend with sudo or su or ensuring you're using the right user.\nThat said, there's an app called Focus ($20) that has a very rich feature set that will allow you to block not just websites, but apps as well.  There's a \"take a break\" function that will allow you to release the restrictions for a configurable amount of time allowing you to take a break or as you described, get something when needed.  The price point (IMO) is quite reasonable for what it provides.\nPlease note, I'm not affiliated with this app/company in any way nor do I personally use it. I just know of this product as a result of having to find a tool for parents of students - who were not focused on the task at hand - that gave them the ability to manage their distractions automatically; mainly due to location (parents at work, kids at home not doing homework).\n", "Q: Regular USB thumb drive rubber-ducky? I just thought of this amazing April fools prank: I was going to make my friend think that his Mac was hacked using a rubber ducky. I realized that it'd take a long, long time to develop, so I decided to get started today. Anyway, I don't have a rubber ducky. I have a thumb drive, though, and I was wondering if I could put some sort of file in the root directory of the thumb drive that would turn it into one.

However, if you do an nslookup it will still return the IP address of the host you're querying.  Remember, DNS is essentially an address book - it translates or maps names to numbers.\nWhy does your ping fail?\nThere are any number of reasons, but these are the \"big three:\"\n\n*\n\n*host can be down\n\n*it can be configured to not respond to ping\n\n*the firewall can block/reject ICMP packets - from either/or both your computer, your network; their computer, their network\n\n\nWhen I am on another machine on the same network, I can ping deeznuts.noodleofdeath.com successfully\n\nIf others can ping it, the host is obviously up and not rejecting packets.  To find out why packets on a particular machine is being dropped, you need to do a packet capture with something like Wireshark to see where the packet is going and where it's failing.\nI would look at these factors (in order):\n\n*\n\n*firewall on the local machine that could be dropping packets\n\n*network firewall (local network) blocking ICMP/ping packets from a particular host, range of addresses, subnets, or networks\n\n*firewall on the remote machine blocking/dropping packets from particular hosts\n\n*network firewall on the remote network blocking/dropping packets from a particular host, range, or subnet.\n\nAn easy test to see if it's related to something security like the firewall or IPS software is to assign the IP of the machine that can't ping to a different machine.  If it fails, it's security related.  If it works, it's your host.\nI can't rule out any IDS/IPS software that may be running on the remote.  For instance, if a host or firewall sees too many pings from a particular node, it will stop responding to requests from that node.  This is a very common tactic in preventing DDoS attacks.\n\nA: The issue appears to have been firewall related as mentioned in Allan's answer.

I am aware that the M1 is a different chip and requires programs to be rewritten to run on that new chip. I am also aware that some programs which have not yet been rewritten to work on M1 chips can still be run on an M1 device through emulation in Rosetta 2 (albeit less efficiently, but they'll still work and can still be used).\nQuestion: can every single program that ran on Intel chips still run on M1 devices one way or another?\nNote: the practical thing I am trying to answer is: if someone buys an M1  device, can they be extremely confident that all of the programs they ran on Intel Macs will work (in one way or another) on the new M1 Mac? Or are there some programs which simply will not work at all (yet)?\n\nA: \ncan every single program that ran on Intel chips still run on M1 devices one way or another?\n\nAs of November 2020, the answer is no. Programs that require virtualization support, for example, such as Docker or VMWare don't work on M1s yet. They will likely be updated to work in the coming months -- the M1 supports virtualization, but virtualization is a very low-level CPU-architecture-specific feature, so can't be emulated in a reasonable way.\nVirtualization is a major piece of functionality that's known not working, but there are a number of other specific programs that don't seem to work yet. Here's a Twitter thread covering a few that are relevant to software developers.\n\nA: No.  If you're still running MacOS 10.6, you can use the original Rosetta to run PowerPC programs on an Intel Mac.  Rosetta 2 doesn't let you run those on an ARM Mac.\n\nA: For those seeking an answer from a technical perspective:\nNo. And as noted by Apple themselves in particular, virtualization softwares (such as VirtualBox, Xen) will not run on Apple Silicon M1.\nApple Silicon M1 is based on ARMv8 instruction set architecture, where as Intel ones are based on x86-64, and the instructions for running virtualized systems are different fundamentally.\nAnother difference is that, ARMv8 doesn't have native x87 data types, and in particular the 80-bit extended floating point type (1-bit sign, 15-bit exponent, 64-bit significand). This means that Rosetta have to emulate 80-bit floating point in software, and due to the legacy nature of x87 technology, the compatibility of this area will be particularly tricky to ensure.\nSpeaking of floating point, Intel and ARM SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) instructions and registers also operate slightly differently - not at mathematical level, but in ways they handle rounding, calculation errors.\nLastly, most programs are written in high-level programming languages such as C, C++, Python, etc. If care had been taken to ensure portability, they don't have to be re-written - the vendors only have to tweak a few build settings and compile the program again and sign them, they'll be ready for the new platform.\n\nA: I bought a M1 Mac for dev work, and I use the following site to check the status of softwares compatibility of apple silicon. Their list is decently comprehensive.\nisapplesiliconready\nAs of Dec. 18th, 2020, the following apps do not work with rosetta 2\n\n*\n\n*SEGGER Embedded Studio\n\n*Google Drive File Stream\n\n*Haskell\n\n*Box drive\n\n*WD Discovery\n\n*Rhinoceros 3D\n\n*Barracuda VPN\n\n*Pro tools\n\n*Neutron plugin\n\n*Nectar plugin\n\n*LFO Tool plugin\n\n*Virtualbox\n\n*Revit\n\n*VMWare Fusion\n\n*Parallels\nThings that depend on these application also won't work. Notably, I found no way to run a Kubernetes cluster.\nAt a glance, they tend to be apps that use virtualization, tinker the filesystem, or use OpenGL. However, I expect the developers to catch up within a year or so since they are working quite actively. For example, Docker not working was a main deterrent from purchase for devs, but a month later Docker seems to work.\nNotice that for Google File System and Box, you can get away with RClone and OSXFuse, which I tested to work.\nMy verdict is that you should be fine using this for work if you need nothing from the list immediately.\n\nA: \nIs every program that ran on Intel Macs capable of being run on the new M1 Macs?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes, but it really depends.\nRosetta 2 is the compatibility layer that will allow legacy software to run on the new Apple Silicon.  It's this compatibility layer that will allow you to use your old software on this new chip much like how the original Rosetta allowed you to use software for PowerPC Macs to run on the new Intel based ones.\nI very much hesitate to say that every program will work because there are always exceptions to the rule. Simple function apps or apps that don't make extensive use of hardware will probably work fine.  More complex apps or ones that make direct calls to hardware will likely have issues.  For instance, virtualization software like VirtualBox or Parallels won't work.   If you need Boot camp - that's off the table altogether.  So if you need to run these apps for whatever reason, you're out of luck for now.\nOther specialized apps/products could have compatibility issues.  MusicTech recommends holding off for now until thorough testing can be done.  This is good advice across the board.  When your business and/or livelyhood depends on having a stable platform to get work done, switching to a brand new platform is risky, no matter how hyped and shiny the new product is.\nIf this is your sole computer and it's for work - hold off.  The software that you use is what brings in money and if nothing works, the brand new machine you just bought is effectively a paper weight.  It's like buying a brand new, state of the art robot to manufacture something only to forget to bring in all the new electrical and network connections to run it.\nIf you have multiple machines and you can continue functioning without it, then I encourage you to go get a new Mac and start testing (I can't wait to get mine in a week or so).  This way you'll know what works, what doesn't and what your options are down the road.\n\nA: \nQuestion: can every single program that ran on Intel chips still run on M1 devices one way or another?\n\nThis is in some sense a very narrow question because of the universal quantifier \"every single program\", and on the other hand a very broad question because of \"one way or another\".\nThe former means that we have to find only one single counterexample to make the answer be \"No\", but the latter means that we have infinite resources available to make the answer \"Yes\".\nSo, I will answer \"Yes\", every single program that ran on Intel chips can still run on M1 devices. Here's the proof: if you spend enough money (say, a billion dollars) and hire enough engineers (say, a hundred) and give them enough time (say, 20 years), then you can analyze every single element of a current Intel i9 CPU and write an emulator that emulates every single transistor, capacitor, resistor, wire, layer, interconnect, flip-flop, register, voltage, current, oscillator, clock, instruction, etc. accurately, and simply run the program in question within this emulator. It will probably be about 100 million times slower than running it on an Intel CPU directly, but it definitely will run \"one way or another\".\n\nA: There can’t be any guarantee, for several reasons.\nOne reason is bugs: It is possible to have bugs in software that have by sheer coincidence no effect. If you make any change, suddenly that bug hits you. And changing from intel code to arm code is a big change.\nThe other reason are limitations. The arm processor doesn’t support some intel vector operations. Everyone using these operations should have checked that they are available before using them. If they didn’t, that’s also a bug, and will make the arm version crash.\nAll these things are easily fixed, but sometimes things go wrong.\n\nA: \n... M1 device, can they be extremely confident that all of the programs they ran on Intel Macs will work (in one way or another) on the new M1 Mac?\n\nIdentify your critical apps and make sure you maintain the hardware to keep it going.  Then jump into M1 with both feet because you will never stop hem-hawing about it. Those apps will eventually port or drop out of the Macosphere altogether. Either way the problem is solved.\n\"all Mac programs\" is too vast of a problem space for a practical solution to what is a personal issue. Reflecting on two Apple Computer, Inc. chipset changes I've experienced it was essentially no different than all the OS updates, application updates, et cetera, that we've endured since 1984.\nOver time the greatest engineered incompatibility headaches, for me, were caused by software updates breaking their own data and file formats. Microsoft was the worst, breaking Word file formats then dropping support on every new release. Heck, one time, at band camp the office I used my personal Mac to convert correspondence from a new MS Word (for PC) format to our not-upgraded PC's.\n", "Q: How do I route system audio to specific channel on audio interface?

I'm currently on Catalina 10.15.7.\n\nA: Looking back, past crashes are logged in the log system, and also individual dump files are saved for about a month in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports\nLooking forward, to cause them is a bit harder and risky.

None of the paths I have in the /etc/paths.d directory are being added to $PATH in any of the shells on my High Sierra system.  Presumably there’s supposed to be something in some file that says to look in /etc/paths.d when a shell starts; what is that something and where should it be?\nIdeally I’d like to know a proper way (i.e. not some weird hack that technically solves the problem but will cause more problems down the line, because that’s almost certainly how I got into this mess) to get $PATH to use the contents of /etc/paths.d for at least bash and zsh.\n\nA: /usr/libexec/path_helper is used to build PATH from the default in /etc/paths and the entries in /etc/paths.d (see man path_helper for details).

I have OS X version 11.0.1 (Big Sur), and checked to see if my Xcode were up to date. I originally installed Xcode from the app store because I'd read that if you do it that way, it updates automatically. When I checked, the Xcode version was 11.3.1, and when I looked at this link in the Xcode 11.x - 12.x (since SwiftUI framework) table, it seems like the Xcode version should have automatically updated to 12.1.1.\nWhat I Want To Know:\nI read that if you download Xcode from the app store, it updates automatically, whereas if you download it from developer.apple.com/download, it doesn't. Given that it doesn't seem to have updated itself after downloading from the app store, should I download version 12.1.1 from developer.apple.com/download? If so, will it continue to not update itself, and I should plan to update it manually from now on? Or do you have any other advice on how I should handle this?\n\nA: Xcode is not automatically updated as a consequence of updating to Big Sur.\nJust installing Xcode from the App Store itself won't automatically ensure it is updated. This only happens if you have enabled automatic updates in the Mac App Store settings.\nIn any case, there can be a lag from the time the new version is released and until the automatic update feature on your Mac notices it and upgrades.\nYou can always just open the App Store, go to the page for Xcode and hit the \"Update\" button there.\nIf you download and install Xcode manually from a link, then no, it will not automatically update from that point on.\n", "Q: Fonts showing in Font Book but not in Finder I randomly found a font called 'Baloo' in Font Book, yet I can't seem to find out how it's been installed.\nWhen I click on one of it's variants in Font Book, it says that I need to 'download' the font, and presents me with a download button like the below.\nThe font doesn't appear to be in my library folder and I can't find the file for it anywhere else.

Is it possible to connect an external monitor to a regular iPad 6th Gen?\nThe goal is to use it to watch Netflix, etc.\nI found some Lightning to HDMI cables, but my monitor only has DisplayPort input. Are there any Lightning to DisplayPort cables?\nWhat resolution monitor can the iPad use?\n\nA: This is an excellent question as converting in this direction (Lighting/HDMI to DisplayPort) very rarely comes up.  Offhand, I don't know of any Lightning to DisplayPort adapters and I don't suspect that you'll see any as the market for that type of adapter is very small.\nSo, to do this, you will need the following:\n\n*\n\n*The Apple Lightning to Digital AV Adapter (HDMI output)\n\n*An active (powered) HDMI to DisplayPort Converter\n\n*A USB power source.  Either on the monitor or via a USB power adapter plugged into the wall.  A regular phone charger (12W) adapter is more than sufficient.\n\n*The HDMI and DisplayPort cables to make the connections\n\nWhy is this so convoluted?  Unfortunately, going from HDMI to DisplayPort isn't very easy.  There are HDMI monitors and televisions everywhere, so manufacturers build for that.  DisplayPort monitors are designed for use with higher end computers (like Macs) and not for \"consumer grade\" displays.\n\n*\n\n*Display converters are one way, meaning the descriptor tells you which direction the conversion goes (i.e. \"DisplayPort to HDMI\" or \"HDMI to VGA\").\n\n*DisplayPort is most prevalent on high end computers (like Mac) whereas HDMI is ubiquitous.\n\n*It's easier to convert DisplayPort to HDMI.  As such, you can get both active and passive adapters.  Going from HDMI to DP,however is not as easy so an active adapter is required.\n\n*Because it's active, power is required, thus the USB-A connector on these adapters.  If the monitor has downstream USB ports, it will be able to supply the necessary power.  If not, a simple USB phone charger that plugs into the wall will do\n\n*DisplayPort has power on it's bus, so it can \"self power\" an active adapter.  HDMI doesn't, this is why it needs additional power.\n\nAn alternate solution would be to connect a Mac to that monitor and Airplay your video to it.\n", "Q: Intuos 3 Drivers for Mac OSX Sierra (10.12) I have an old Wacom Intuos 3 tablet (with pen and mouse) that I occasionally use with my Mac (OS 10.12.6 - Sierra).\nI noticed my Wacom Intuos 3 mouse was acting strange (clicks not always being registered). I tried to re-install the Wacom Drivers for the tablet to troubleshoot whether this was a hardware (mouse itself) or software (drivers) problem.\nWhen I reinstalled the latest drivers that work with Intuos 3 tablets for Mac (Driver 6.3.15-3), the Wacom Preferences Pane kept saying there was something wrong with the driver and the computer needed to be restarted, and if the issue persisted to re-install the driver. I restarted my computer a few times and still had the issue, then I un-installed and I re-installed the driver and still had the issue.\nI realized it was probably because the supported Mac OS versions were 10.8 - 10.11 according to the Wacom Driver site and searching \"Intuos 3\".

I want to use an ARM version of iTerm2 (Universal binary), then run latest ZSH (may be x86_64 depending on what version brew installs, then also use a mix of ARM and Intel binaries.\n\nA: There's some mis-understandings about what each of the elements are...\n\n*\n\n*Terminal - The terminal is just the utility that allows you to execute commands.  Think of it as a \"window\" into the system.  You can open a Terminal on a PowerPC Mac, then establish a connection to an a new M1 Mac that in turn connects to X11 desktop running on Linux on an Intel CPU.  In other words, the Terminal doesn't determine what environment you ultimately work in.  If you're on the new M1 Mac, the Terminal will be the native M1 compiled Terminal.\n\n\n*The shell is the environment in which you operate; it's the actual user interface.  You're probably familiar with Bash and Zsh (default shell since Catalina). This too will operate as the native compiled environment, so if you're on the M1 it will use the shell compiled for that platform.  The shell is just how you send commands to the OS to do things including run binaries.\n\n\n*Executing binaries depends on what that binary was compiled for.  We know that a Linux binary (even compiled on x86) won't run on macOS.  The binary has to be compatible or you need something that gives you that compatibility.  For example, FreeBSD has a Linux compatibility layer. This is where Rosetta comes in; to make Intel instructions compatible on Apple ARM.\nRosetta is the tool or \"layer\" that allows you to run x86_64 instructions on the ARM chip.  So, if you want to execute a widget that is only available on x86_64, you would run that on Rosetta.\nSo, using your example, you would run the universal binary of iTerm2 (native to ARM)  to use the universal binary Zsh shell that was compiled on ARM to either launch the universal binary tool natively compiled on ARM or the x86_64 tool compiled under Intel via Rosetta.\nFrom the comments:\n\nI wonder why Homebrew team are suggesting to open terminal under Rosetta?\n\nDoing some related research on MacPorts, there are many, many ports that do not yet support compiling under ARM; Bash is one of them and I've included the Port Health page for reference.  See below:\n\nThey will tell you to open Terminal (or iTerm2) under Rosetta to ensure you're initializing an x86_x64 environment.\n\nIf a binary includes both arm64 and x86_64 instructions, the user can tell the system to launch the app using Rosetta translation from the app’s Get Info window in the Finder. For example, a user might enable Rosetta translation to allow the app to run older plug-ins that don’t yet support the arm64 architecture.\n\n\nSo, Terminal (or iTerm2) will be universal (runs natively under ARM) but the environment will be able to support the x86_64 instruction set.\n", "Q: Disable magic switch to Apple watch I have had a mt Apple watches for 4 years now (first a series 2 now a series 4) and I always have the following issue: When I active Siri on the watch with my AirPods connected to iPhone (and listening to audio) the following happens:\n\n*\n\n*Siri is activated on the watch\n\n*AirPods connect to the watch causing audio playback to stop\n\n*Siri waits for the AirPods to connect (taks around 3-5 seconds, sometimes longer)\n\n*Siri is ready for input\n\n*After input the AirPods don't switch back to the iPhone causing met to take my phone and connect/play again\n\nIs there any way to disable 'Magic Audio Handoff' to the watch?

I want to look at the Rosetta 2-translated binary specifically; I'm not looking to build a Universal 2 app myself (that would be trivial).\nI attempted to run the program through Terminal ($ ./helloworld) and even stick it inside of a .app, put it in the Applications folder, and double-click it. In both cases, the program runs correctly, but according to $ file helloworld, the binary is still x86-only (Rosetta 2 didn't add an arm64 executable).\nAny idea how to force Rosetta 2 to translate a binary?\n\nA: If you've written a program in C, simply compile the program twice, using Mac's version of gcc, and then use lipo to combine them into one program.\nSee https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building_a_universal_macos_binary for Apple's explanation of the process to create a universal Binary (containing both x86_64 and ARM64) \n\nA: This is a bit late, but you can directly run oahd-helper and pass it two file descriptors (the x86 binary to translate as the first and a file to output the translated bin to as the second). The location of oahd-helper varies (on Big Sur it’s in /Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah, on Monterey its /usr/libexec/rosetta).

Does anyone know how I can find this information on the ipad?\nOn the iPhone, there is a similar issue if you go to the facetime app. However, if you go to the phone app, it shows the call history, but there is no phone app on the iPad.\n\nA: FaceTime history are stored into each device you make FaceTime calls with.\nIt looks like Apple don't let us see our detailed history, only a global one with recent calls. But there is something we can be 100% sure about : is that the complete logs are stored somewhere on your device.\nIn my case, even with Handoff and Continuity enabled, FaceTime calls made with one device won't show up on others after hang-up, expect when I make a classic phone call from my Mac using my iPhone.\nThe only way to find it, would be to extract your device's save file and browse it through a third-party-app.\n", "Q: I cannot open system preference panes I am using Big Sur, and am unable to open the system preference panes.

I have killed a laptop while doing that so be very careful when blowing out the fans.\n\nA: My hunch is the added load on the GPU for having a second display is negligible and won't matter in your hardware. On portables, they tend to have less metal and airflow, so that second screen tends to make the overall heat load measurably higher.\nYou can test this by playing the video with only one screen to verify that the CPU+GPU for that activity are generating the heat load and not the second display.\nApple has their own CPU and GPU now to combat the power needs of the Intel / traditional GPU manufacturers that went into your era of iMac. You can look at efficiency settings, but they will be unlikely to move the needle on that era hardware.\n", "Q: Can Browsers on iOS use Content Blocking?

Is there a way to put it in stone that the finder window size shouldn't change? Through Terminal perhaps?\n\nA: The common trick stops working when you open a new Finder window starting at a folder you've never viewed before—a location that doesn't have any Finder window info saved. You could replicate this by making a new folder on your desktop and then double clicking it to open in a Finder window. You'll see the size has been reset.\nI'm pretty sure the \"real\", permanent Finder default is hard-coded into the Finder binary. I've seen stuff hinting towards that within Hopper.\nHere's the next best thing—you can set up an Automator service that quickly resets the front Finder window to your preferred size:\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator, and create a new Quick Action / Service.\n\n*Set \"Service receives no input in Finder\"\n\n*Add a \"Run Applescript\" block.\n\n*Paste in: tell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Finder\" to set size of front window to {770, 460}\nEdit {770, 460} to your preferred width and height, respectively. Note that you can find a Finder window's current size by running the following in Script Editor: tell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Finder\" to get the size of front window.\nWhen you're done, save your Service with a name like \"Reset Finder Window Size\". You can also go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services and assign your Service to a keyboard shortcut.\nThe first time you run the service, it will likely fail. To fix, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Automation and grant Finder the ability to control System Events.\n\nA: Personally I think this AppleScript solution may be a good fit for your needs.\nSTEP 1: Close all of your Finder windows then open a new Finder window and set its size and position to what you would like your default window size and position to be.\nSTEP 2: Open Script Editor.app and create a new document.\nSTEP 3: Insert this following code into that new document… tell application \"Finder\" to set windowBounds to bounds of Finder window 1 and run the code …This will retrieve the coordinates for the location and size of that Finder window\nSTEP 4: In Script Editor.app, create a second new document and insert this following code… tell application \"Finder\" to set bounds of Finder windows to  then paste the coordinates that you copied from the first script… as demonstrated in this following animation.\nYou can test that it works the way you want it to by clicking the run button. If all is well, save that second document as an application. I named mine “Default Size”\n\nSTEP 5: Open a Finder Window, and while holding the command key, drag your new application to the menu bar in your Finder Window. Now anytime you want in any open Finder window, simply click the app that you just created. This is demonstrated in the next animation.\nBe sure to grant the appropriate privileges for your new app in Security Preferences\n\nDepending upon how much time you feel like investing in automating Finder, there’s no limit to some of the detailed scripts you can create to control the Finder.\nFor example, I like all of my Finder windows displayed as column view with the side bar set to an exact width. I also have Finder set to open new windows in tabs. But occasionally other apps open Finder windows in a new window and next thing I know I have 5 or 6 Finder Windows opened… some of which are in tabs and with different views etc.\nSo I decided to build on the code I supplied in this post.  My version centers the Finder windows, sets them all to column view and sets their side bar width then merges all windows to tabs.\nFor my extended version of this code to work, first I needed to assign a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences, for the “Merge All Windows” menu item in Finder because by default, that menu item does not already have a keyboard shortcut.\n\nHere is my version of the code. As you can see in the following animation, each Finder window has a different view and some have no side bars.\nproperty windowNames : missing value\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set windowsRef to a reference to Finder windows\n    set windowNames to name of windowsRef\n    set collapsed of windowsRef to false\n    tell windowsRef\n        set current view to column view\n        set bounds to {383, 112, 1108, 735}\n    end tell\n    repeat with thisWindow in windowNames\n        select Finder window thisWindow\n        delay 0.1\n        tell Finder window thisWindow to set sidebar width to 250\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    set frontmost to true\n    repeat until frontmost\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 123 using {option down} -- ⌥ ←\nend tell\n\n\n", "Q: Why are network speeds reported by Activity Monitor different than the ones reported by speedtest.net?

I think this sites claims to sell Mac Mini 2020 M1 Ram Upgrades to 64gb https://www.crucial.com/compatible-upgrade-for/apple/mac-mini-%282020%29\n--but--\nEverymac.com and the Verge.com both claim the RAM limit is 16gb and is not upgradable.  I don’t understand the confusion from these sites or am looking at old articles, not finding the correct links for new M1 Macs.\nCan the M1 Macs get aftermarket RAM upgrades?\n\nA: No RAM upgrade - you would need to reflow new processor board or be skilled enough to rework the one you have.\nRAM Memory on the Apple Silicon M1 Processor is integral to system package “chip” that’s mounted as one unit to the logic board. There is no slot or place to add memory on the M1 based Air, Pro or Mini. The SSD chips have separate placement on the logic board from the Processor board. Everything is soldered to the logic board for Apple Silicon Minis.\nI would not mistake an 8 GB RAM Air, Pro or Mini for anything but a beast of a workstation for most tasks.

Our app shows that we have Desktop devices in our metrics.\n\nAlthough iOS apps can now be made to run on macOS, we have explicitly declined/disabled that feature (at least we think we did...) for now both in the Xcode build and in the App Store Connect availability.\n\nThe phrasing is a little confusing to me. The checkbox mentions Silicon/M1 devices explicitly, but I thought Desktop compatibility applied to (potentially) any macOS device on Big Sur. Either way, it's unchecked!\nFurther, none of the App Store Connect analytics seem to show that we have Desktop device entries for our users/units. Only the \"Sales and Trends\" page shows any Desktop data.\nThis is befuddling. How could a Desktop analytic event have gotten in there? I'm willing to accept it's some weird fluke, but also want to make sure we're not missing something and a certain subset of macOS users are somehow able to run our iOS app.\n\nA: It seems that your declining the macOS option is administrative only. It does not prevent people running your .ipa on their M1 Macs, so long as it's running under the correct Apple ID.\nTo do this you need to extract the .ipa from the phone to the Mac, using iMazing.\nFrom The Verge, a quote from the makers of iMazing\n\nApp management has been available in iMazing since November 2017. We did not do any particular adjustments to ensure that iOS apps exported from iMazing’s library would run on Apple Silicon Macs. It turns out that when developers choose whether or not to include their mobile app on the Mac App Store, no change is made to the app itself – the setting is purely a distribution toggle.\n\n\nA: You could have downloads/purchases using an older version of iTunes.\nApple removed the App Store in iTunes in September 2017. iTunes version 12.7 comes without the App Store. It's possible that iTunes prior to this version still are able to download/purchase apps from the App Store even today.\nLooking back in my old statistics in App Store Connect/Sales and Trends, I can find that I have the desktop section as well.\n", "Q: Does the 2020 Apple M1 MacBook Pro support 2x daisy chained Thunderbolt Displays? The Apple Silicon based 2020 Apple M1 MacBook Pro supports Thunderbolt version 3 and I'm wondering if anyone has tried connection one to an Apple Thunderbolt Display?\nOf course you'd need to use one of Apple's Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 converters.\nI also understand that this version is limited to supporting only a single 4K or 6K display, but since the original Apple Thunderbolt Display is only 2K I’d want to try and daisy chain these.\nCan I run more than one external display from the Apple Silicon M1 CPU/GPU based MacBook Pro (or Air)?\n\nA: No, you get only one external display - for two supported displays total and they do not chain (in the case of the mini and two external displays).\nOne is the MacBook Pro / Air screen and the second can be as large as the 6K Pro Display XDR. The Mac mini has the same limitation - two displays only, no chaining of displays. Initial reports from the Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter are very encouraging that those displays work well. As do the latest displays with newer connections.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/specs/\nNow, just because Apple doesn’t support it, you can add all sort of Thunderbolt docks and USB to HDMI adapters.

It looks like you can push things far more using DisplayLink software instead of the supported direct connection with reasonably priced adapters if you really need more pixels and are willing to sacrifice performance and handle third party display software limitations and potential bugs.\n\nA: The youtube video showed 5 display works with M1 systems is not using M1 video solution, but a third-party DisplayLink (not DisplayPort) solution, which using USB ports and the computing power of installed systems to redirect/ repack the video output via USB ports.\nSo, technically speaking if your systems have unlimited USB ports, then you can have unlimited monitors connected to the systems (not limited to M1 systems), as long as the connected systems can provide the process resources for the DisplayLink converter/adapter.  That is why the solution MUST have a matching DisplayLink driver for the installed OS version on each connected system.\nThe solution is not perfect, but looks like is the only solution currently to provide multi-monitor for M1 systems.\n\nA: This videos shows how to connect 3 monitors on macbook pro with M1 chip:\nhttps://youtu.be/yxrM394Rka4\nmake sure second dock is compatible with DisplayLink drivers.\nits working for me. :)\n", "Q: How do you change the notification duration in Apple macOS 11 / Big Sur How do I change the time of how long a notification stays on the screen in macOS 11 Big Sur?\nThere's no setting for this in the system preferences.\nI macOS Catalina the following command in Terminal worked (followed by a re-login to the system), whereas the number at the end of the command determined the number of seconds the notification stayed on the screen:\ndefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime -int 2\n\nIn earlier versions of macOS the command looked like this:\ndefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime 2\n\nNone of these commands seems to work on macOS 11 Big Sur.\n\nA: Judging by the output of defaults read com.apple.notificationcenterui it appears that specific preference domain key is no longer available.

Since the new Macs have ARM chips, there is now access a build of macOS that technically could run on a device like, say, the iPad Pro? The architecture should be pretty much the same, I guess?\nClearly some tinkering would be required, but what are the main technical obstacles to it, even with the right skills and tools?\nI suppose this would be something similar to what the Hackintosh community has been doing for over a decade with macOS on Intel computers. Only instead of creating Clover bootloader etc. to make macOS \"think\" it's running on a Mac, the same would be done on a jailbroken iPad, making macOS think that iPad is a Mac.\nObviously one would pair a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to get that desktop experience. Heck, maybe even a second monitor through the thunderbolt port on the iPad Pro?\nI figure the coolest thing would be to have a dual-boot of both iOS and macOS on the same iPad. I guess virtualisation on top of iOS may also work, but I think the performance would be way better if running bare metal macOS.\nAnother cool idea, Imagine having macOS as a dual boot option on your iPhone 12. All you would need would be a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and an adapter to plug it into a TV, and your phone could be your computer to go wherever you needed it.\nI am mainly talking about a fully function version of macOS here, with GUI, Bluetooth support, etc.\n\nA: Technically it is possible.\nApple made a Developer Transition Kit (DTK) available to developers back in June 2020 - i.e. the recently released M1 Macs were announced. This DTK runs macOS Big Sur on an A12Z CPU. This is the same CPU that the iPad Pro 2020 has.\nThe latest release of Big Sur still runs perfectly fine on the DTK, although a few things aren't perfect. For example the A12Z CPU does not contain the same virtualization functionality as the M1 - essentially making virtualization a no-go here. The M1 and the A12Z compared also has a lot of other differences - which are the cause of the big performance difference in running macOS on the two systems.\nBesides the CPU itself, there are other things to take into account however - most importantly being drivers for the basic peripherals and bootloading - especially the signing of the operating system.\nIf Apple wanted to make macOS boot on iPads, those issues are very small and could relatively easily be overcome. After actually booting (i.e. getting the kernel running) - then comes the question of getting the actual graphical user interface running on the iPad. This involves having a suitable driver for the GPU - and drivers (which can be quite complex and involve a lot of high-level functionality) for things such as FaceID/TouchID, the flash drive, camera, audio (speakers/microphone), touch module, cell subsystem, etc.\nIf others wanted to try doing it, you would need a bootloading exploit to get the non-Apple-for-iPad-signed operating system to get accepted. Also you would need to acquire or create drivers for all those elements of the iPad.\nGetting macOS to boot into a text-only command prompt on the iPad is probably feasible for outsiders within a reasonable time frame. Getting a full macOS working with support for all peripherals, Bluetooth mouse/keyboard and external Thunderbolt monitor - probably not something we'll see before long. Prediction is ofcourse always difficult, especially if it's about the future.\n\nA: The SSD storage systems in most iOS devices might not be designed for long life expectancy when being used intensively for virtual memory backing swap space.\nNote: iOS does support virtual memory, but only uses VM backing store for memory mapped files and for \"freezing\" background apps, not for generic application page swapping.\n", "Q: Cannot change login wallpaper in 11.x Big Sur?

This is a bit of an unusual question but I have a Mac server that gets hit with a lot of DDoS attacks. Usually my data center's mitigation system catches them but sometimes they slip through. When they do, they often can completely kill my system's TCP/IP. Even accessing localhost does not work. TCP/IP is completely dead. But the system is not frozen. It still runs perfectly fine otherwise. I know this because once I reboot the system, I can see all of the log entries from my scripts from the entire time it was offline. I have screen shots of the desktop from when it was offline.\nRebooting the server in this state returns it to normal. But I'm hoping there's some way I can restart just the TCPIP stack without rebooting the whole OS? That would at least let me regain access to the machine in a way that, while clumsy, would be significantly less so than hard remote reboots via IPMI.\nThis is all just a band-aide while we work out ways to shore up the DDoS mitigation. But it would be a good band-aide. Also useful, and along similar lines, would be a way to hard flush ALL TCP connections, established, half open, everything including all state information.\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to restart the TCP stack, but the question should be why TCP becomes unresponsive, it must be hitting some limits in the stack.\nIf the service creates new connections to answer incoming requests, it is possible you're hitting the default 16K limit on ephemeral ports and the even more problematic 30s (MSL*2) timeout on TIME_WAIT connections until they can be reused.\nYou can use sysctl to tweak those:\nsudo sysctl net.inet.tcp.msl=1000 # default 15000\nsudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first=16384 # default 49152\n\nThe default TCP queues are also rather small (128 waiting sockets):\nsudo sysctl kern.ipc.somaxconn=2048 # default 128\n\nIf you are also getting port scans or DoS to unused ports you can reduce backscatter by enabling blackhole mode and limiting ICMP/RST responses:\nsudo sysctl net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2 # default 0\nsudo sysctl net.inet.udp.blackhole=1 # default 0\nsudo sysctl net.inet.icmp.icmplim=50 # default 250\n\nOnce you are happy with the sysctls you can persist them in /etc/sysctl.conf.\nUse something like sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf to create it.\nI would also suggest to install HAProxy on your server in front of your services and use it to apply rate limiting and filtering for backend connections. You can even do packet inspection like dropping connections with invalid SNI headers. The easiest way to install haproxy on the Mac is through Homebrew.\n", "Q: iPhone X stuck in recovery mode after maxing out storage. Getting \"Error Code 14\" So a couple of weeks ago I restarted my iPhone after it started glitching like crazy, when I tried to boot it up again it got stuck on the Apple logo. A couple of days later I found an article that said something about booting it into recovery mode and then updating it through iTunes would fix it, well big mistake. Now it's stuck in recovery mode. I have tried every possible thing I can think of to boot it out.\nIncluding:\nUpdating it in iTunes\nUpdating it in Finder\nSwitching cables\nSwitching computers, from Mac to Windows\nUsing Reiboot to boot it out of recovery mode\nUsing Reiboot Pro (Paid Version of Reiboot) to \"Repair the operating system\"\nUsing 3u tools to repair it.\nUsing checkra1n to jailbreak it in DFU mode\nUsing a Windows computer to try to mount the iPhone as a removable storage device\nAnd a couple of other 3rd party tools. None of which have successfully fixed it.\nAny help or advice would be much appreciated.\nP.S. This iPhone is a business phone with a lot of important information on it that hasn't been backed up in quite a long time, so it's very important for me to try to get the information off of it.\nThanks\n\nA: If the iPhone is currently stuck in a reboot loop, try to enter DFU mode and restore it using iTunes.\nDFU mode is entered by:\n\n*\n\n*Connecting to Mac with Lightning cable\n\n*Press Volume Up, then Volume Down quickly\n\n*Press and hold right (Standby) button until display goes dark (about 10 seconds)\n\n*Keep holding Standby and also press Volume Down for 5 seconds\n\n*Keep holding Volume Down, but release Standby button\n\nWhile the display stays black, iTunes or Finder should say that it found an iPhone in recovery mode and you will be given the choice to return it to factory settings which will wipe the storage and apply the latest firmware.\nEntering DFU mode from a reboot loop is very tricky, since it is likely to reboot before you are finished. Try to start the procedure as soon as the Apple logo is displayed and don't be discouraged if you need a few tries.\nIf that doesn't fix it I would contact Apple, maybe the storage is faulty. Flash storage needs free space for wear leveling and running it near full for a long time can cause a lot faster aging of the memory cells. I would recommend keeping at least 20% free space to counter that.\n", "Q: Cron job cannot find ffprobe/avprobeor ffmpeg/avconv even though its installed I have a cronjob setup to run \"/Users/admin/Scripts/youtubedl.sh\"\nScript:\ncd \"/Users/admin/Music/youtubedl-music\"\n/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" --download-archive .mydownloads -i -f bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://youtube.page/here\n\nCron fails saying \"ERROR: ffprobe/avprobe and ffmpeg/avconv not found.

Mine is mac pro m1 and this error causing no backlight on the touch bar. All I can do is wait for the password screen to show up and turn off my device. But sometimes this causing my device to restart and shows error reports (kernel panic). Idk why this happens, probably because big sur bugs.\n\nA: So while I have this issue still, I can share my findings on what I've been doing to \"fix it\" on my model.\nI've been running into two issues:\n\n*\n\n*the exact same issue when returning from sleep with the same shortcut, where I get a frozen login screen;\n\n*I can actually log into my computer - or what seems like I logged in since I see my windows - and move my mouse, etc., But can't really interact with anything (get the \"error\" sound);\n\nNow, my model is a fingerprint (TouchID) enabled Macbook.

On Big Sur that separate volume is also signed to prevent unauthorized modifications.\nWhen you're booting from the Recovery terminal, you're essentially using a different file system and not seeing the contents of the actual sealed system volume that would see when booting normally.\nYou cannot delete the kext's from a normal boot as the volume is read-only.\nI would really advise against modifying the sealed system volume, however if you really want - then ensure you have backups and time on your hands, and then you can use the following command in Recovery mode to turn off the verification of the seal:\ncsrutil authenticated-root disable\n\nAfterwards you can mount the sealed system volume and remove the kexts you want. Then to make the system bootable again, you run this command:\nbless --folder mountpoint/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot\n\n(all in one line)\nNote that \"mountpoint\" should be the name of the folder, where you have mounted the sealed system volume in read-write mode.\n", "Q: How to color all menu icons white?

I don't need to install applications from app store, so it is not an issue. But I wan to receive OS updates.\nIs it possible to receive OS updates when using a MacBook without having to sign in for Apple ID?\n\nA: Yes and no. Upgrades can require an ID, updates do not.\nWith an MDM, you can push out most apps and updates without any Apple ID needed on the machines. Also in the yes, many but not all OS updates are pushed from the device channel and not the user channel of the App Store.\nNo for some cases if the machine is older.

Or, even better, that shows whether a core is big or LITTLE? For example, neither htop (on Rosetta 2, installed with Homebrew) nor Activity Monitor show which cores are which, since both seem to assume that all cores are homogeneous. I've seen some (old) htop modifications for Debian (see, e.g.., here) but nothing similar for Mac. Additionally, htop doesn't seem to have an option to show the clock frequencies of each core, which I suspect would also be enough to distinguish them.\nAs a side note, this is mostly to check how Electron apps are running (such as VS Code). Do they mostly run on the LITTLE cores, or do they actively hog a good chunk of the big cores? Etc, etc.\nAny utility for seeing this would be phenomenal. Thanks!\n\nA: Pull core information using powermetrics, monitor with your favorite tool. However, be wary, and consider if it's worth the effort.\nIdentifying P/E cores\nUnlike on iOS, this is thankfully quite easy on macOS. Using the built-in powermetrics tool, we can identify which cores are the performance (P) and which are the efficiency (E) cores. Unfortunately I don't own an Apple Silicon equipped Mac, so these screenshots are courtesy of Matthew Panzarino on Twitter. If you have the time, I also recommend reading his TechCrunch article on the M1.\n> sudo powermetrics -s cpu_power\n\n\n\n(Probably, not actually 100% sure of the command)\nAlthough I don't have any source for this, I wouldn't be surprised if cores 0-3 are E-cores and cores 4-7 are P-cores on all M1 chips. Still, I'd recommend checking for yourself.\nCool! Off to the races it is then, right?\nActivity Monitor as an example\nActivity Monitor has a nice feature to monitor per-core CPU usage, hidden under Window -> CPU History (shortcut ⌘ + 2.) top/htop/Glances/iStats/Task Manager/whatever your favorite status app is probably has something similar.\n\nHowever, you'll immediately notice a problem. While the total load on each core is immediately apparent, what's doing what where is not at all. Vice versa, we can see what's do what quite easily if we look at the normal Activity Monitor window, but not on which core. Even on something like htop, which readily provides far more powerful insights and tools than Activity Monitor, getting it to show (even at the process level) what's on which particular core is not an easy task.\nScheduling and stuff (sorta)\nIt's at this point that we need to address the fact that programs don't just run on one core forever. Forewarning: I am by no means an OS expert, so I'll be doing my best to just address things from a high level. If there are mistakes, please feel free to edit or leave a comment!\nModern systems typically contain at least one scheduler, handled by the OS (typically within the kernel) that decides what runs when and on what physical resources. On macOS (and other Darwin based OSs), this takes the form of a queue within the Mach kernel. However, Apple's OSs also contain a second layer of libraries designed to assist in this task at a higher level. The Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is Apple's sorta main approach to this: it contains a whole bunch of useful classes that can be used by develops to help optimize their application. In turn, GCD schedules code to run on a variety of threads, which it hands off to the the OS to decide what runs on what core. All of this is constantly being swapped around and changed to best utilize available hardware resources.\nHopefully it's possible to see how things are a little bit messy at this point. While this is by no means untangle-able, it's a little tricky—especially when so many tools have been built with the assumption of homogenous cores.\nSolutions\nIdeally, we'd like something that (grouped by process) would show up how much each individual core was used by all threads belonging to or used by that process. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anything. Problem is, everything I have found doesn't log what's using what core in a way that's easy to deal with. For example, want to know what process owns what threads and what core a thread is running on in htop? Easy, turn on tree view and enable the PROCESSOR column. But want to have it sort by which processes are using a few cores the most? Good luck.\nWhile I'm sure there's a way to make it work—if nothing else, these are open source tools—it's not something easy or straightforward that I know of. Barring these general purpose tools, is there another option?\nProfiling\nAs with a homogenous CPU architecture, if you really want to know what's happening inside your application, the best way to do it is by profiling it. This is true for figuring out which core you're running on, among other things.\nHow exactly you go about this is going to depend on how your application is built. For native Mac apps, Apple's Instruments tools (built into Xcode) can provide a great look into what's running where. For Electron apps, you might be able to use Chrome's Runtime Performance tools since Electron is basically Chrome; however, I'm not particularly familiar with it.\nThing is, these are intended as dev tools. They take setup, they (usually) require some access to source code (or something like it) to work well, they provide a lot of information, and they're not always the easiest to work with. Which brings us to the next point:\nWhy?\nI'm as much of a fan as the next guy of knowing just to know; it's great being able to see what's doing what and play with your workflow. But do consider for a second what you're actually seeing: some (likely) very situational and complicated numbers that are frankly kinda hard to work with. Optimizing software is hard enough when its your job; as an end user, it's a whole other game.\nSo, even though I'd love to see it as much as the next person, I suggest maybe just... not worrying about it too much. Look at the total per-core utilization, sure; look at the per-app energy consumption. But in terms of what's on what core under what conditions, don't worry about it.\nOf course, if anyone does come up with a tool, I'd love to see it :)\n", "Q: Can an application that requires JRE 6 run in Rosetta 2?

I've bought a new router (LinkSys WRT32x), flashed OpenWRT onto it, and set it up as a NAS server with a disk attached (formatted in ext4 because OpenWRT is a Linux distro).\nI have the disk recognised as a Time Machine backup disk through Samba 4, and I'm now backing my MacBook Pro wirelessly.\nHowever, if I have to recover from this partition, as it is formatted in ext4:\n\n*\n\n*Will I have to do so wirelessly through my router (supposing my Mac can still access the LAN in whatever state it's in) or will the disk be recognised as a Time Machine backup when plugged into my Mac?\n\n*What will happen if I can't restore wirelessly, will my Mac even recognise the ext4 disk?\n\nAny knowledge or advice appreciated, I am keen to learn.\n\nA: Yes, you will have to do via the router. It could be wirelessly or via a cabled ethernet connection. This is normally not a problem as macOS Recovery supports Wi-Fi and restoring from network Time Machine backups.\nIf you plug the disk directly into the Mac it will not be recognized as a Time Machine disk, and you will not be able to access its contents without a third-party ext4 driver.\n", "Q: Can I tell my Mac to charge to 80% only? I leave my MacBook plugged in for days at a time, so the battery stays charged to 100%. Despite Apple claims to the contrary*, I believe that the battery's capacity would be better preserved if I could keep it at an 80% state-of-charge. Is there any command or setting that would let me disable charging from the power adapter?\nHere are various options, (1) being my most preferred:\n\n*\n\n*A setting to automatically maintain battery at 80% SoC (like my Tesla has)\n\n*A setting/command to use the AC adapter for running power only (\"not charging\" state)\n\n*A command to tell my Mac to totally ignore the AC adapter power\n\n(2) could be cobbled into (1) with some kind of script. Even if not possible from the Mac itself, (3) could be cobbled together with an IOT switch. But with (3), it's unclear the lower maintained SoC would outweigh the cost of the additional cycling.\n* As of 11 Feb 2022, I can no longer find Apple claims that it's best to fully charge the battery.\n\nA: You can try AlDente (there is also a Pro Version):\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge Limiter allows you to set your maximum charging percentage between 20 and 100 percent. You can either set it by using the slide bar or by typing in the desired percentage in the field above and pressing enter afterwards.\n\n*Discharge - This feature allows your MacBook to run completely on Battery even if it is plugged in. Therefore, you can actively discharge your MacBook to a more healthy percentage. Unfortunately, while Discharge is activated, clamshell mode is not supported due to technical limitations.\n\n\n\nA: Use bclm (Intel MacBook only)\nFollow the instructions on github:\n1. Download signed and notarized binary from releases.\n# Alternatively, you can also get it from homebrew or compile it manually. Read github readme for more details.\n\n2. Extract battery tool\n$ unzip bclm.zip\n$ sudo cp bclm /usr/local/bin\n\n# 3. Set battery limit\n$ sudo bclm write 80\n\n# 4. Verify battery limit to 80%\n$ blcm read\n\n# 5. Reset the limit back to 100% when needed\n$ sudo bclm write 100\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*It might be better if you set it even lower, for example, 60% or 70%. Then, before you need to use it on battery for a long time, sudo python3 main.py -r. You can automate this switching between 80% and full using launchd (read man launchd.plist).\n\n*macOS show charge approximately 3-5% greater than the real value, so it may feel like the tool is not working initially. Use coconutbattery (GUI) or ioreg -l | awk '$3~/Capacity/{c[$3]=$5}END{OFMT=\"%.3f\";max=c[\"\\\"MaxCapacity\\\"\"];print(max>0?100*c[\"\\\"CurrentCapacity\\\"\"]/max:\"?\")}' to calculate real battery charge level.\n\n*If you are using macOS Catalina or higher, you need to turn off the \"Optimised battery charging\" function for the tool to work properly, otherwise the value you set might be overwritten.\n\n*There is also a GUI version: https://github.com/godly-devotion/charge-limiter. Both work by setting the BCLM key in SMC to a custom value.\n\nFor Apple Silicon Macs and macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher, use AlDente.\nAlternatively, there is more lightweight tool with a command line version: battery.\n\nA: Tried below and it worked.\nOpen Terminal and run\nxcode-select --install\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/DevNulPavel/osx_battery_charge_limit\ncd osx_battery_charge_limit\nsudo python3 main.py -s 80\n\nI set limit to 70 and it does stop charging until 72%\n\nA: macOS 10.15.5 on a Mac notebook with Thunderbolt 3 ports has this option (even a bit smarter) embedded, see Optimised battery charging.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT211094\n\n\nA: There is also Energiza Pro.

I've been wrestling with a 14TB+ video library for the last months trying to dedupe and sort all of it into production ready folder structure.\nFor the life of me I have not been able to find (spent 3 solid days with no sleep) a script that will sort a folder of video files, using their dimensions, into Portrait and Landscape folders.\nThe closest I've found is this -\n#!/bin/bash\nshopt -s nullglob\n\nfor f in *.{mp4,MP4,mov,MOV,m4v,M4V}\n    do \n        height=`mdls -raw -name  kMDItemPixelHeight \"$f\"`\n        width=`mdls -raw -name  kMDItemPixelWidth \"$f\"`\n        mkdir -p \"${height}x${width}\"\n        mv \"$f\" \"${height}x${width}\"/\n        \n        printf \"File: $f\\n\"     \n        printf \"> Dimensions: $height x $width \\n\\n\"\n    done\n\nprintf \"All done! \\n\"\n\nWhich gets me closer by sorting them into folders based on dimensions, but it's not what I'm trying to achieve.\nAlternatively I found this script for images using Imagemagick, (which I installed via Homebrew) it does read the files, though it moves them ALL into the portraits directory.

But for now, this is working for me:\nSummary\nA Siri shortcut executes an Apple Script on the Mac that starts the radio stream with the Music app and adds the HomePod as airplay output.\n1. Apple Script to start the radio stream\nOn the Mac, create a script using the Script Editor application and save it e.g. to ~/play-radio.scpt.\n# ~/play-radio.scpt\ntell application \"Music\"\n    set selected of AirPlay device \"HomePod Kitchen\" to true\n    set selected of AirPlay device \"HomePod Living-Room\" to true\n    play (every track of playlist \"My Radio Playlist\")\nend tell\n\nIn the Playlist \"My Radio Playlist\", I've added the radio stream I want to start. I suppose, one could also add the radio stream's url directly. But this way, I can modify the playlist without re-opening the script again later.\n2. Create Shortcut to execute the script\nWith the device that has been paired with the HomePod, e.g. the iPhone or iPad, open the Shortcuts app and create a new shortcut that is named after the desired Siri command, here: \"good morning\"\n\nAdd the workflow item Run Script Over SSH. Enter the hostname of the Mac and your Mac's user-account name. Choose \"SSH Key\" as authentication method. Add the command to execute the apple script:\nosascript ~/play-radio.scpt\n\n3. Import the SSH Key\nIf you haven't done so already, export the public SSH Key of the Shortcuts app by clicking on the SSH Key entry, share, and then air-drop it onto your Mac.\nOn the Mac, add the key to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.\nAttention! This will allow the Shortcuts app on your iOS device to ssh into your Mac.\n4. Activate SSH\nIf you haven't done so already, activate SSH remote login on your Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"System Preferences\"\n\n*Go to \"Sharing\"\n\n*Activate \"Remote login\"\n\nNow the HomePod will understand \"good morning\" and execute the script, which will start Music on the Mac playing the radio station on the Mac and the selected AirPlay devices.\n\nA: It looks like your solution plays a list in the Music app instead of TuneIn.

I know this is really old, but except for the battery (which I removed from the laptop) it is still a great machine. Everything works fine except apps installed from the App Store do not start (downloading and installing works fine).\nAs an example, after downloading The Unarchiver, immediately after double-clicking on the app, I get the following error message:\n\nThe Unarchiver quit unexpectedly. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.\n\nAgain, this happens with all apps from the App Store (not just \"The Unarchiver\").\nStrangely enough, apps installed not from the App Store work just fine. I tried installing Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Minecraft, and all apps are starting and working normally.\nI digged around a bit and found out that maybe this problem is related to app signatures not working for the App Store somehow. For example, I verified the signature of \"The Unarchiver\" using the following command in my terminal:\n$ codesign --verify --verbose /Applications/The\\ Unarchiver.app\nThe Unarchiver.app: CSSMERR_TP_CERT_REVOKED\nIn architecture: x86_64\n\nSignatures for apps downloaded outside the App Store are OK:\n$ codesign --verify --verbose /Applications/Googe\\ Chrome.app\nGoogle Chrome.app: valid on disk\nGoogle Chrome.app: satisfies its Designated Requirement\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on here?

Disabling the rule allows messages to come to the inbox from the SMTP server, which indicates this was the root of the problem.\nThis same rule is not visible anywhere within Mail.app, for some reason.\nThe moral of the story for me is, \"when in doubt, check the webapp\".\n", "Q: Mail App Showing As \"talagent\" in Mission Control simple one just wondering why is my Apple Mail showing as \"talagent\" in mission control?\nAny idea how it can be fixed?\n\n*\n\n*I do not realise when it switched to this name\n\n*I tried rebooting and resetting RAM but it's still showing the same\n\nA: From a wild guess in comments, which seems to have worked…\ntalagent is the service responsible for relaunching apps after a restart etc.\nSomething has got confused, so try…\nQuit Mail, then delete the contents of\n~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.mail.savedState/\n(not the folder itself as it's an alias) Then relaunch Mail.\n", "Q: What is invalid internal_flags (0x28000) warning? I have an external hard drive with 1 HFS+ partition and 3 APFS partitions. When I run Disk First Aid (in High Sierra), it finds no problems with the HFS+ partition. It also reports \"drive appears to be OK\" for the APFS partitions, HOWEVER I get several warnings like this on each of the APFS partitions:\nwarning: inode_val: object (oid 0xHHHHHH): invalid internal_flags (0x28000)\nwhere 'HHHHHH' is a hex number.\nI've searched online and can't find any mention of a flag value of 0x28000. What does this mean? Is it anything to worry about? Please explain.\n\nA: The reason you cannot find it is that there's no single flag with a value of 0x28000 - rather that is the value of internal_flags, which is a combination of multiple flags.\nIn particular 0x28000 corresponds to a combination of:\n0x20000 = INODE_FAST_PROMOTE\n0x08000 = INODE_NO_RSRC_FORK\nINODE_FAST_PROMOTE means that the inode is scheduled for promotion from slow storage to fast storage. I.e. the next time the operating system reads in this inode, it is supposed to be promoted.\nINODE_NO_RSRC_FORK means that the inode does not have a resource fork.\nWhy this combination is illegal depends on the state of your system, which you haven't specified. For example INODE_FAST_PROMOTE is only valid on a Fusion drive, and particularly it is only valid on an inode stored on the slow drive in the Fusion drive.\nThis particular warning could come from various causes depending on your specific system - for example:\nA) You have a Fusion drive and this inode was migrated from the slow drive to the fast drive without removing the flag. It would be an operating system bug.\nB) You haven't got a Fusion drive and this inode was tagged for promotion anyways. That would be an operating system bug.\nC) A hardware error occured with the drive, interfaces, or other place that caused this particular bit to flip inadvertenly.\nSo to sum it up: If this is the only warning you have, and you experience no other problems - I would take care to ensure that you have working backups, and then disregard it.\nIf this is only one of many warnings, and you have experienced that more and more warnings are given - I would highly suspect that the drive is about to fail and needs replacement.\nIf you absolutely want to get rid of the warning, I would suggest taking a full backup - reformat the drive - and restore the backup.\n", "Q: How to remove Google Chrome from Spotlight suggestions in macOS Big Sur Starting Big Sur I have Google Chrome that returns in every possible Spotlight result.\nThis is very annoying because if I do a typo in Spotlight and hit enter then Google Chrome shows up.\nIf I recall correctly before there was an option to disable this by unchecking: System Preferences > Spotlight > Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight and Look up. The option is not present anymore on Big Sur.\nThe only categories I have enabled in Spotlight are Applications, Calculator and System Preferences.\nHow can I stop this behavior from Spotlight? Or exclude Google Chrome from it?\n\n\nA: It's impossible to make Spotlight do what you want but you can install a replacement. I like ueli, which is both free and open source.\n\nA: New in Big Sur’s Spotlight are web search completion results.\nThis is not the Google Chrome application presenting itself, but rather web search results showing in Spotlight able to be opened with the default web browser. Since your default web browser is Chrome, the icon of Chrome shows by the results.\nIt’s currently not possible to remove web search results from Spotlight.\n\nA: You can disable one (or more) specific applications from ever showing up in Spotlight by:\n\n*\n\n*Moving it (or them) into a separate folder (like /Applications/private or something in your /Users/<user> folder)\n\n\n*Adding that folder to the exclusion list in System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy.\n\nA: The best/only option remaining in Monterey is to remove \"Siri Suggestions\" from the Spotlight preferences (System Preferences). Still, you might also want to remove Bookmarks & History (same list in System Preferences > Spotlight), since those will allow Spotlight to suggest websites you've ever visited that happen to include your search term.\n", "Q: What is the exact equivalent of this netsh wlan add filter Windows command for Mac? I want to block all networks from my PC with admin access and make it so that the user cannot reverse the changes. I will use admin access to only white list certain networks that will be visible to the user and all other WiFi networks are blocked. I am blocking all connections in Windows with the following command. Since I am just starting out with macOS, any help in this regard is appreciated.\nnetsh wlan add filter permission=denyall networktype=infrastructure\n\n\nA: \nSelecting the option to \"Block all incoming connections\" prevents all sharing services, such as File Sharing and Screen Sharing from receiving incoming connections.\n\nStart with the firewall general help is my advice.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642\nOnce you know how those controls work, a follow-on question might work on how to lock this down, whether you use MDM or configuration profile or make a user not an administrator so they can’t change a setting you as the administrator set.\nP.S. there is no exact equivalent as the systems are architected differently.\n", "Q: Archive Utility Error 13 - Permission Denied attempting to create archive I want to compress a Time Machine backup folder to a Zip file on another drive. I've set what I believe are the right preferences for Archive Utility. But when I try to run it, I immediately get \"Error 13 - permission denied\". It doesn't tell me whether the problem is with the source folder or the destination archive, and I don't know where to look.\nI've read everything I can find on Archive Utility, but can't find the solution. Does Archive Utility need write permissions on the source item? If so, that could be my problem.\nAlso, what user does Archive Utility run as? Is there complete documentation for it anywhere?\n\nA: It is not a good idea to compress the folder as a zip. Time Machine uses directory hard links a lot and zip does not recognize them. So you might end up with a zip archive 10 time (or more, depending on size and modification frequency) bigger than the space your Time Machine backup originally requires. If you have to have your backup as a file, then create a compressed image from your Time Machine disk.\nOpen Disk Utility. Select your TM drive, and go to \"File - New Image - Image of \". Then choose \"compressed\" in \"format\". Choose a location and click \"save\". This operation might take several hours to several days depending on the size and complexity of your backup.\nIf you want to do it no matter what, you have to use the command line.\nsudo zip -9ry /where/you/want/zip/to/be.zip /path/to/backup/\n\n", "Q: Can I select a clip in imovie by specifying the start and end time?

I have a couple of different problems with ls /Volumes. 1st, I have an AppleScript that could mount only 10 of my 13 volumes. The 3 I could not mount were named Data 1, Data 2, and Data 3. I renamed those 3 volumes to Data 11, Data 22, and Data 33 and now my Applescript can mount all 13 of the volumes.\nTo debug this, I ran the following AppleScript:\nset mountList to do shell script \"ls -l /Volumes\"\ndisplay dialog mountList\nset thisDisk to \"Data 1\"\n\nif thisDisk is in mountList then\n    display dialog thisDisk\nend if\n\ndo shell script \"diskutil unmount \" & quoted form of (\"/Volumes/\" & thisDisk)\n\nThe result of display dialog mountList was:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 29 root  admin   928 Nov 20 21:40 Data\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 30 bud   staff  1088 Nov 20 21:40 Data 11\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 31 bud   staff  1122 Nov 21 18:48 Data 22\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 28 bud   staff   896 Nov 20 21:40 Data 33\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel     1 Nov 19 20:02 MacHD -> /\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 15 bud   staff   480 Nov 20 21:40 Parallels\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 11 bud   staff   352 Nov 20 21:40 Photo Data\ndrwxrwxrwx+  3 root  wheel    96 Nov 17  2018 TTSS\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 56 root  wheel  1972 Nov 20 21:40 TTSS 2\n\nTTSS is a volume I erased 2 years ago. This is the first phantom volume I noticed.\nThe result of display dialog thisDisk was Data 1.\nThis is the 2nd phantom volume I observed. Remember, I have renamed Data 1 to Data 11. I presume this phantom Data 1 is what caused my original mount script to fail to mount Data 1: the OS thinks Data 1 is already mounted.\nThe do shell script resulted in the error message\n\nUnmount failed for /Volumes/Data 1\n\nThe result if I run display dialog mountList again is the same list as above.\nI reran the debug script with thisDisk set to TTSS. It, too, returned the error message that Unmount failed.\nSomehow, Data 1 is in the list of volumes but it doesn't appear. Somehow TTSS is in the list of volumes, and it shouldn't be. How do I get rid of the phantom volumes? Data 2 and Data 3 behave just like Data 1.\nI should mention that I barely understand AppleScript and Terminal commands, so I will probably need step-by-step help.\n\nA: Before removing anything, run mount and eject or more safely, I would disable every network connection, detach all drives and then reboot.\nAt that point you can be sure all the directories are actual directories (except the system mounts) and clean them safely and strategically.\nGoing forward, I would never mount anything here. Let the system manage it if at all possible. Make a different mount point if you want to make manual network mounts.\n\nA: It's still not very clear what you are trying to accomplish here, but let's get some misconceptions out of the way first.\n/Volumes is just a directory like any others, it's only special because macOS by defaults mounts drives/partitions there. In order to do this a directory within /Volumes is created for each mount (and usually removed again at the end). The removal part doesn't always work though, so you may end up with stale directories like TTSS. To get rid of it you can run sudo rmdir /Volumes/TTSS from an account with admin privileges.\nAlso, as mentioned, the content of /Volumes is managed by macOS automatically. So when writing a script to automatically mount volumes you shouldn't rely on the content of /Volumes (you probably don't want to touch MacHD for instance) but keep the list of relevant volumes separate.\n", "Q: How to fix macOS Big Sur Dock after having customised it on Catalina for uBar I had a sweet setup for using uBar for favourites and the MacOS Dock for seeing open applications before I upgraded to Big Sur.\nI had used commands from this Ask Different question: Is there a way to completely disable Dock?\nEven after I upgraded to Big Sur, everything for working fine perfectly.

I had used both the commands - \"The Simple Fix\" killall Dock and \"The Slightly Less Simple Fix\" defaults delete com.apple.dock; killall Dock.\nThen I relaunched the Finder as recommended in the same article and now I'm back to my fantasy setup.\nSorry for the bother, I hope this helps others as well.

And as you have already tested, it also does not support using /dev/stdout or a named pipe or similar, as it will recreate the file when outputting.\nHowever, you can use ordinary shell scripting \"tricks\" to make a \"one-liner\" for combining the commands if you wish to do so:\n sips -s format png test.icns -o __$$ && base64 __$$ && rm __$$\n\nNote that this is for Bash, and that it will create and delete a temporary file named __.\nAlso note that I have removed the -w0 parameter in your question from the base64 command. That is a parameter you would use on for example the Linux version of the base64 command, but the macOS command does not have such a parameter. Indeed that wrapping behaviour you request with that parameter is already on by default on macOS.\n", "Q: Does disabling the prompt to enable two-factor authentication on an iOS device disable future prompts from appearing? I was recently working with an iPhone user who noticed that since updating to iOS 14, they were being prompted to set up two-factor authentication on their Apple ID. They temporarily dismissed the prompt by navigating to Settings, tapping the \"Two-Factor Authentication\" option and selecting \"Not Now\" - but out of interest, will this prompt re-appear - or does choosing this option disable all future prompts from appearing on that device (or Apple ID)?\n\nA: You cannot guarantee that the user will not be prompted in the future.\nThere's a continued development in security and the need for preventive measures. Today two-factor authentication is absolutely crucial and wide-spread, 25 years ago it was only used by the few.\nApple some times \"moves the bar\" by changing the minimum security requirements. In those cases, they could start prompting user's again for enabling two-factor authentication - or even requiring it entirely.\nFor example, not so long ago the requirements for developer accounts were changed so that these users must have two-factor authentication enabled (also affects apps such as TestFlight, App Store Connect, etc.). These users were notified in advance that this requirement would be instated.\n", "Q: \"ip route get 8.8.8.8\" equivalent in Mac? In Linux, I use ip route get 8.8.8.8 to determine the route and interface to connect to IP 8.8.8.8.\nSince iproute2 is unavailable on Mac, what should I use instead?\n\nA: You can simply use the route(8) command\n$ route get 8.8.8.8\n   route to: dns.google\ndestination: default\n       mask: default\n    gateway: 192.168.0.1\n  interface: en0\n      flags: <UP,GATEWAY,DONE,STATIC,PRCLONING>\n recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire\n       0         0         0         0         0         0      1500         0\n\nThe ip tool is not supported on MacOS because it's a very Linux-specific implementation (Netlink).

When navigating to the Settings app on an iOS device, there are three categories of setting that allow for an account to be added - either Mail, Contacts or Calendars (adding an account can be achieved by opening the respective category, tapping \"Accounts\" and then on \"Add Account\"). What isn't immediately obvious, however, is whether it's possible to remove an account from one of the above categories, whilst keeping the data synced from another - for example, I may wish to remove an Exchange ActiveSync mailbox from the native Mail app, but keep my contacts syncing from that same account within the iOS Contacts app. So - my question. Is it possible to either add or remove an account from the Mail, Contacts or Calendars section of the iOS Settings app - whilst keeping data from that same account synced within the other categories that it hasn't been deleted from?\n\nA: In a word, yes.\nNavigate to\nSettings > Mail > Accounts\nSelect the account you want to edit/change\nThere will be on/off buttons allowing you to selectively sync only those parts of the account you want.\nIn the screen capture below I have only Mail turned on.

I would like to watch some videos from iCloud, via my iPhone without downloading. But when I open Files app from iPhone, it just downloads the media file to my phone. I know even though I streamed, I'll consume the same amount of data, but if I stream rather than downloading I'll save some time.\nSo, in summary, my question is:\nHow to stream a video file from Documents, from iCloud to iPhone?\n\nA: iCloud is a file synchronization service, not a streaming service.  So, the short answer is - you cannot.\nThere's a big difference between opening a file and streaming a file.\nWhen you open files, whether it be on your local device like your computer or your phone, across the network to/from  a shared folder on a friends computer or from a file server or even across the Internet, it is copying the file to a local store before it opens it to play it.\nWhen you stream a file, a service on the server (remote) will open the file and broadcast the contents of the file (audio/video) over the network. The (local) client will then \"listen\" for this network traffic, capture it, then play it.\niCloud doesn't do this; it's not AppleTV.

Initially there was no problem. But after a few weeks my Macbook started to shutdown suddenly at about %15 (in changes time to time, sometimes it can be 5%). And when it is closed, I couldn't open it without connecting charge cable.\nBecause of the quarantine I stuck at home and using it while charger is connected, even it has 100% charge, but not for too long like 1 month or so. But I don't think that's the reason.\nAnyway. I controlled battery health with coconutBattery and it was about 80-85%, I can't remember clearly, maybe even more, but I'm sure it was not less. Then I did a research and found SMC & NVRAM reset. I did those resets and calibrate the battery by charging to 100% and draining until it shuts down itself.\nThe sudden shutdown problem seemed to be solved, but after a few days the Service Recommended warning started to appear. And when I checked with coconutBattery, it said 55% battery health. Still same value with small changes. I mean, how this can be possible? The cycle count is not even close to its limit, it just have 350 cycle. I have friends who has same computer for more than 5 years and more than 800 cycle without changing the battery and their batteries' health are much better than mine.\nIt seemed like a software problem to me. Before try formatting or downgrading to High Sierra I just wanted to ask you. Thus I won't waste my time by backing up and formatting if it won't make a difference.\nNow I have to charge it like every 4-5 hours. And I realized that sometimes the battery percentage is going up. Like, I am looking the percentage and it shows 65% and I am going back to my work, write something in Word etc. 5 minutes later when I check that again, it shows 66%. That's odd.\nI don't want to buy a new battery, I can't spend that much money right now.\nI apologize for the long text, I just wanted to explain everything :)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Have you contacted Apple to get a quote on the battery? They can run diagnostics remotely and send a box. It’s worth the time in case they want to service the battery due to a service program at no cost to you. Once they ask for service, it could be a short time till it stops working entirely. Or you could run on wall power at slower speeds until you want to replace or repair it.\n", "Q: Upgrading High Sierra to Catalina on 2016 MBP using local webserver In the past colleagues (and I) believed it was often a bad idea to install newer OSs on older Macs. I get the feeling that has changed, and that putting Catalina on my 2016 MacBook Pro shouldn't be a problem.\nWhat I'm wondering about is whether my local webserver will survive the upgrade. I have Apache/MySQL/PHP set up in the same approximate manner as we were told to do this years ago - sites running in /Library/WebServer/Documents, custom hosts and httpd-vhosts.conf files in /private/etc and so on. In past os upgrades and moves to new machines it's been necessary to re-set-up all that, which isn't a huge problem but also not a lot of fun.\nIn the past it helped that I was migrating to a new machine, so I had access to my whole old setup and could do things like export MySQL databases from the old and import into the new. This time I'm thinking about upgrading my existing machine so I won't have easy access to a backup while I'm doing this.\nI hate the thought of buying a new machine just so I can upgrade the OS. On the other hand this is my work machine and it's 4 years old (and has a dead speaker) so perhaps it's time to bite the bullet.\nAny of you experienced migrators have an opinion about which way I should go?\n\nA: \nIn the past colleagues (and I) believed it was often a bad idea to install newer OSs on older Macs.\n\nIt's actually a bad idea not to upgrade to at least more current versions of OSes as you will miss out on important security and feature updates.  There's no evidence that Mac's can't or shouldn't be upgraded.\n\nWhat I'm wondering about is whether my local web server will survive the upgrade.\n\nIt depends.  When Apple releases a new OS, they try to update all of the 3rd party software as well. This means if Apache changed things from one version to the next, you could potentially break something. Without knowing which version you had, which version you're going to, what your config looks like specifically , it's impossible to tell you whether it will break or not.  However, in the interest of playing it safe, assume it will.\nThe ideal path is to keep your web server up and running, install/upgrade your OS onto a different machine, deploy your web server, test it out and once everything is working switch over.  It's never a good idea to take a running (production) web server and just upgrade the OS in place and hope for the best.  It's not a good idea to do this with individual services for that matter (i.e. Apache, MySQL, PHP, etc.)\n\nAny of you experienced migrators have an opinion about which way I should go?\n\nUse Virtual Machines\nUnless you have a special use case, I advice folks to not load up an AMP stack on macOS.  Why?  If your site is being hosted somewhere it's likely a Linux variant or FreeBSD.  You want to keep your test/dev environment as close to your production environment as possible.  When you have a VM, you can easily manage the web server environment independent of the host OS.  You can also clone the VM, perform the upgrade as I described earlier and if it succeeds, simply forward traffic from the firewall to the new VM - you wouldn't have to purchase a single piece of hardware.\nIn my use case, I standardize on FreeBSD and use only the bare minimum that I will need for my AMP stack.  This keeps the overhead for the VM as low as possible. There's no desktop environment, no client software, nothing but the core OS and the AMP stack with necessary dependencies.  I usually have my DocumentRoot pointed to an iSCSI LUN on a NAS or SAN (locally or in the cloud).  This way, I can very easily move data from VM to VM without much downtime.  My NAS has it's own multi-level backup so I can be certain data is secure.\nThese are broad stroke suggestions and you'll need to tailor it to your  specific environment.  By using VM's to host your web server, you gain a lot of flexibility especially if you want to migrate from a locally hosted machine to a cloud based instance.  It's very easy to copy a VMDK to an Azure or AWS container and then scale as needed.  Since you're considering a migration/upgrade, now is the time to do this - migrate to a virtualized environment.\n\nA: Thanks for the input, everyone. After talking with my colleagues who use and like MAMP, and asking the MAMP developers if I can run MAMP alongside the built in webserver, I think what I'm going to do is get MAMP Pro and start moving sites into it, moving away from using the built-in webserver. I have time - the OS upgrade is being forced by TurboTax, which requires something newer than High Sierra, and which I won't need until next spring. So I have until then to get comfortable with MAMP and move everything I care about into a MAMP-controlled universe.\nThen when the time comes to upgrade the OS - or buy a new machine - with all the sites encapsulated in MAMP-land and not being dependent on customizations to the built-in webserver, I expect it will be easier to make the transition.\n", "Q: I have a 50 GB storage plan for a previous phone that I still pay for. How do I make it cover my new phone? I had  an iPhone now I have a Samsung. I am still paying for my storage plan for the iPhone. How do I get my new phone covered with this plan?\n\nA: It's assumed you mean an iCloud storage plan and not a storage plan sold/supported by your carrier (i.e. AT&T has Personal Cloud).\niCloud storage is tied to your Apple ID, not to the device itself.  So, all devices that you have signed into with your AppleID, will have access to that storage pool.  Once you sign out, the device will no longer have access to it.  Since you're using a Samsung (Android) device, the only way to access iCloud is via the iCloud Website (https://icloud.com).  If you no longer need this, you simply have to cancel it as there's no Android app for iCloud.\nIf it is a plan through your carrier, to move your service you would need to contact them for support.\n", "Q: What results in the price difference for seemingly the same product? I am considering buy the latest Apple Mac Mini M1 with 512GB storage from Apple or from Amazon. Apple lists it at $899 while Amazon lists it at $859. What is the hardware/software different that results in Amazon being $40 cheaper than from Apple directly?\n\nA: There's no hardware or software difference.\nAs with all other retailers, everyone is free to set their own price. The price can be based on all sorts of parameters, which makes it impossible to say exactly why retailer A is xx$ cheaper or more expensive than retailer B.\nIt could be for example that a retailer has lower costs. For example having an online presence versus a physical presence is typical less costly. Similarly could spending different amounts on customer service, warranty repairs/support, etc.\nIt could also be that a retailer that is also the maker of the product wants to be in the market at a relatively high price in order to ensure that other retailers find it worth while to sell their products.\nIt could also be that one retailer earns money from other sources than the specific product sale - and that makes it possible for them to lower their price. For example by gathering data about the customer, or simply by having the customer browsing their web site making it more likely that they will buy other products from the same retailer.\n\nA: Manufacturers sell to shops at a trade price, let's say 75% of the full retail price. The retailer makes their money from this 25% difference in price. Retailers can reduce the retail price from their cut, if they think that this will attract more customers, in order to sell higher numbers.\nThe retailer hopes to make more money from a slightly smaller margin by selling more units.\nThere is no difference in the hardware, and you get the same access to Apple's services - iCloud, Music, TV, etc. You can take it into an Apple Store if you have a problem with it.\n", "Q: How to download and install updates to these Apple apps in this macOS without an Apple ID? Can I download the installer? If so, from where exactly? I need to update Numbers, Pages and Keynote on macOS 10.15.7 but I do not have an Apple ID. Is it possible to update macOS without Apple ID? has an answer which is insufficient for me and is closed so it cannot receive any further answers.\n\nMost important thing to remember is that a user only needs the Mac App Store to download the installer, which downloads the update to the machine.\nYou can also download the installer from the Web by visiting this link on Apple Support website.\n\nIf I go to that download site and type \"installer\" in the bar no results are found.\n\n\n\nSo I am stuck.\nQuestion: How can I download and install updates to these Apple apps in this macOS without an Apple ID? Can I download the installer? If so, from where exactly?\n\nNote: I just want to update the three Numbers, Pages and Keynote\n\n\nA: The linked question bypasses the App Store, because merely owning a Mac entitles you to macOS. You can also get any of these through Software Update in the Control Panel. You'll note you can only get delta & combo updaters there, not entire installers for the whole OS - for that you need the App Store, or to boot from Recovery.\nTo update any app from the App Store, first you need to be signed in to the Apple ID that \"purchased\" it, even if that purchase was free, or it came pre-loaded on the Mac. The only exception I can think of to this might be Safari, which seems to come through the Software Update channel rather than the App Store.\n", "Q: Messages.app notification only shows contact number instead of contact names on macOS After upgrading to macOS Big Sur (11.0.1), the notification of new messages only shows contact number instead of contact names. I can see contact name, profile pics in my Messages.app and Contacts.app, just not in the Notification Center.\nI have enabled messages in iCloud on both macOS and iOS.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I managed to fix this by going to System Preferences > Language & Region.  I changed the default language from English (UK) to English (Canada) and quit System Preferences.  I then changed the default back to English (UK) and then quit System Preferences again.  I then restarted macOS.\nI have absolutely no idea why that works.  From the number of similar posts on the internet proposing different solutions, I suspect there are multiple possible issues leading to the same problem.  However, this it worked for me on macOS Big Sur 11.0.1.  Unfortunately I can't find the link describing this solution to give credit but if anyone does find it do link in.\nHope this helps you.\n\nA: I did a bit of digging and uncovered a fairly unobtrusive workaround for this. YMMV, but it worked for me. Tested on macOS 11.4.\nBy restarting a few system agents, the bug appears to go into remission.

It just sits at 8% all the time and says: It's not charging even though it's plugged in.\nThings that I have tried:\n\n*\n\n*Resetting default settings in System Preferences\n\n*Removed the option for \"Optimised battery charging\"\n\n*Reset the SMC with my T2 Chip\n\nAny idea what further steps I should take?\n\nA: The first thing I would do is verify the charge cable is capable of handling the wattage of your adapter. (Did you perhaps get an Air adapter or a non-apple cable?)\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700\nThe second is check CPU usage. A runaway process could out run even a 61W adapter that’s using the correct charge cable.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/view-cpu-activity-actmntr43452/mac\n\n\n*Check in Activity Monitor - show all processes: the charging circuitry should be able to net charge past 80% regardless of your “optimize” settings. Only if you have massive energy usage, would this make sense - and on your Mac - it can run the battery down if it’s stuck in a loop - the charger is less powerful than that hardware running 100% on CPU and GPU in some cases.\nThe third would be to open a support ticket with Apple online to run remote battery diagnostics. They have the best tools to pic apart the health status and recommend any actions. A one time SMC reset is good but now that you’ve ruled that out, I would go straight to the authority to see if they can share with you anything specific about your battery health.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211094\nYou can look in About This Mac in system information and as long as the status is healthy, you’ll have an official diagnostic log sent to Apple in case you find it degrading and want to seek warranty or out of warranty repairs.\nYour case where it’s less than 50% and running but not charging should be very easy for Apple to diagnose remotely.\n", "Q: How do I erase MacOS from HDD but keep personal files (i.e. convert a bootable disc to a storage disc)?

When running simulations in MATLAB I have noticed the fans to spin quite loudly, and the CPU temp is rising very high. I have seen the temp peak 100C when plugged in, and around a max of 95C on battery power.\nMy question is whether this is typical behavior for this computer/CPU or whether I am at risk of damaging my components.\n(Note: I am using this completely out of the box - have made no modifications, overclocking etc.. The temperatures I am seeing are just higher than I have seen previously for CPUs and I was shocked to be honest)\n\n\nA: The CPU is specified to function up to 100 degrees C.

But with Big Sur that has stopped to work.\nI used to have vscode and BBEdit on my finder toolbar and after upgrading to Big Sur they just shows 2 big question mark icons.\n\nA: Running macOS Big Sur (11.0.1) I can add an application to the Toolbar in Finder by first selecting the target application in Finder and then while dragging the target application to the Toolbar, and before actually being over it, press and hold the ⌘ key and then drop the target application on the Toolbar.\nYou will know you are doing it right because a green circle with + in the middle of it will appear when having moved over the Toolbar while pressing the ⌘ key while dragging the target application onto the Toolbar in Finder.\n\n", "Q: Zoom in where the focus is I use Mac. When I do a presentation or make a screen recording, sometimes I need to zoom in to the part where the focus is; then I need to zoom out to restore the normal screen size.\nI have seen people doing this, but I don't know how they achieved that by keyboard and mouse.\nDoes anyone know?\n\nA: I believe you can do this with accessibility features that are baked into macOS. They're located under System Preferences -> Accessibility. You can change the keyboard shortcuts under System Preferences -> Keyboard.\nThere are a couple different settings for the zoom type. It sounds like you might want to try fullscreen.\n\nA: You can do that by holding the CTRL-key and scroll up (zoom in) or down (zoom out).\nYou may have to enable the setting first. The setting is called \"Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom:\". You can find it under System Settings -> Accessibility -> Zoom.\nMake sure Zoom style is set to Full screen.\n\nA: Assuming you have pinch to zoom enabled in your trackpad settings, couldn't you pinch in and out on the trackpad in order to zoom in and out?\n", "Q: Pale colors on external monitor with MacBook Pro M1 Yesterday I received my new MacBook Pro with the new M1 Chip. So far I'm really amazed! But there is one point: On my external display (LG 27UK850) the colors, especially black, are really pale. Black is more greyish.\nMy old MacBook Pro (with Intel) never had these color issues with this monitor. Also on the MacBook monitor colors are perfectly fine.\nAnybody else have these issues? Or does somebody know how to solve it?\n[edit] maybe good to know, I tried Display Port and USB-C\n\nA: Have you tried to disable \"True Tone\" for your internal display via display preferences?

It's also slowing down game animations as when my mouse it moving, games won't animate.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: You’re using an unaccelerated virtual monitor. Because your external monitor has no GPU to accelerate its graphics, all rendering is done on the CPU for that display. You can speed it up somewhat by going to the accessibility system preferences and enabling the Reduce Transparency option. But it’s always going to be much slower than an accelerated display.\n\nA: UPDATE: My original conclusion was pure coincidence.\nThe cause was Night Shift. I had Night Shift scheduled for sunrise - sunset. Each day at sunset while Night Shift was transitioning, for about 20 min, WindowServer would use a lot of CPU. It's a macOS bug. I disabled the schedule and do it manually when I need to. It's all been good since then.\nINITIAL answer:\nIn my case,\nmacOS Mojave on a MBP 13\" 2015 connected to a qHD external monitor over HDMI. Logitech G305 gaming mouse.\nSometimes the fan spins up close to 4000 RPM and stays there even if I just use Finder and WindowServer shows high usage constantly.\nThe fix for me: disconnected the HDMI monitor, turned off the mouse, moved the mouse USB dongle to the other side, then reconnected the monitor and turned on the mouse. All was nice and quiet then.\n\nA: My problems were completely identical with OP's, and my logs were showing the exact same results as well.\nI tried many things to work this one out from my research on the Internet, but no luck.\nIn my case the issue was resolved by changing the refresh rate from 75Hz to 60Hz. I don't know the reason but it is magically decreased as soon as I did that. CPU usage is better than ever, no fan noise which was the most problematic issue for me. Also, changing Displays > Color > Display Profile from PHL245E1 to SD170M-A might have helped as well, but after I changed it back to HD one, no significant CPU increase or fan noise detected. Btw, I realized that the Color profiles have HD and SD modes, and in my case PHL245E1 profile is HD one while SD170M-A is, well, obviously the SD one. If someone has a 4K monitor and having issues like this, it might be of help checking these settings as well.\n\nA: If you're using an usb mouse, I've noticed that my gaming mouse causes the WindowServer to use a lot of CPU.\nTurning transparency down in accessibility settings has helped quite a bit.\nAs of Dec 9th, 2020, it looks like it's still happening intermittently with one 4K display and my 2019 Macbook Pro.\n", "Q: -5101 error on Internet Recovery I'm trying to install macOS Big Sur on a 2016 15\" MacBook Pro using Internet Recovery (Cmd-Opt-R during boot), but I keep getting an -5101F error, with a link to apple.com/support.\nI've tried an Ethernet connection and using Internet Sharing to create a WiFi hotspot from another Mac, but that doesn't change anything.\nIn addition, installing the much older macOS Sierra using Cmd-R also fails with the error The installation information on the recovery server is damaged.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: In the past, a similar range of error codes has been network related errors, so if your firewall/router/DNS is filtering Apple network IP (perhaps relating to OCSP shenanigans or just running something like PiHole) you might retry your installation from a very open network. Another thing to try would be a different network connector and reboot your home router / modem network setup to be sure it’s in a clean state.\nMostly, that error is designed to get you to Customer Support however, so starting that chat might be worthwhile if you don’t feel like troubleshooting this without vendor notes on what that error code signifies.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/\nIt’s also seldom popular to just wait a day, since you likely had a reason to recover your mac, but many problems do sort themselves out when it is server side and your process is correct.

Continuously running the application does not count, it has to be (re)started.\nI created a calendar automator script that runs every other night that restarts the application, but that brings the application to the front, and I want it to be launched in the background. Due to the application's lack of AppleScript I cannot use the\ntell application [...] set miniaturized\nwhich is the common solution I find when I search the web for solutions.\n\nA: As you stated \"I created a calendar automator script that runs every other night that restarts the application, but that brings the application to the front\", I assume you have the parts of the workflow in place that closes your application on a timed-basis.\nIt sounds like the part you need solving is how to open the application after it's closed, so that it does not appear in the foreground.\nUsing a Run AppleScript action (deleting any and all sample code that may be present):\nignoring application responses\n    tell the application named \"...\"\n        if it is not running then run\n    end tell\nend ignoring\n\nYou should make sure that the part of your workflow that shuts down the application has completed before moving onto attempt a relaunch.  If the above script executes while the application is in the process of shutting down, it will not do anything.\n\nFor completeness, here's an example script that would handle the closing and relaunching of an application in the background.  It would be run using a Run Shell Script action, and assumes you have zsh installed:\n#!/usr/bin/env zsh\nbgreopen () {\n        pkill -xi \"$*\" &&\n        osascript <<-OSA\n            ignoring application responses    \n                tell application \"$*\" to ¬          \n                    if it is not running ¬ \n                    then run it\n            end ignoring    \n        OSA\n} &>/dev/null\n\nbgreopen Microsoft Teams\n\nReplace \"Microsoft Teams\" with the name of your application.  It uses osascript to execute the AppleScript from the earlier part of this answer, partly to demonstrate its incorporation into a larger solution, and partly because it's very reliable at launching apps silently.\nThe shell command open has an option flag -j used to launch an app hidden.  It has been slightly less reliable at abiding the request to remain hidden in the past, but this was in an earlier version of the OS.  If you want to give this a try instead, it would actually be a more ideal method as it keeps everything executing in the same language rather than calling in and out to other places.  It's also a much more elegant solution:\n#!/usr/bin/env zsh\n(){    pkill -ix \"$*\" && \n       open  -ja \"$*\"\n} &>/dev/null Microsoft Teams\n\nAdditionally, open has a -g option flag, which specifically stops apps being brought to the foreground upon launch.  Used independently of -j, it would open the app behind whatever you're working on, but not necessarily be hidden.  The -j flag ought to imply -g as well, but perhaps it doesn't and explains my varying mileage with it in the past.  So, you can experiment to see what works for you, and you can combine their use together with: open -jga \"$*\" (just make sure a is the last of the option flags immediately before the \"$*\" argument that represents the name of the application).\n\nIf you wanted to optimise efficiency of this process, you can google launchd.  It's the macOS launch demon that regulates execution of programs on a schedule, and would allow you to remove Automator and calendar alarms from the equation.  It would only require a .plist file that defines how often you want to run a script, and the script body or path to a script file, which would simply be the shell script above.\n", "Q: Hide new \"play\" icon in menu bar after upgrading to Big Sur I recently upgraded to Big Sur and I now have a media player icon which I don't really use or need.

I am running my MBP on AC power and without a battery as I'm waiting for a replacement battery from a third-party.

The battery was grossly swollen to the point where the touchpad wasn't working.\n\nA: \nI cannot find out how to alter the CPU_Speed_Limit variable.\n\nYou can't.\nIt's not a variable in the sense that modifying it will increase/decrease your performance.  It's more of an indicator as to what the limit is currently; it's similar to your battery's current charge status - what it is at the time it was measured.\nAs correctly stated in the comments, your Mac will limit performance when the battery is missing: Broken battery - downgraded performance\nUnfortunately, you'll just have to wait until the replacement battery arrives and you install it to regain full performance from your Mac.\n", "Q: Connect MacBook Pro to Smart TV wirelessly I have a MacBook Pro running High Sierra 10.13.6.\nIn my house I have two Smart TVs:\n\n*\n\n*LG Smart TV with webOS\n\n*Xiaomi Mi SmartTV with Android TV 9.0\n\nI would like to wirelessly transmit the screen of my MacBook to these TVs (not both at the same time because they are in different house's divisions).\nI know that Xiaomi Mi SmartTV has Chromecast incorporated but I think that would only work with Google Chrome's \"cast\" feature.\nI want to transmit the screen of my MacBook to these TVs so I can work in different apps, documents, code and watch movies.\nIs there any way to do this without Apple TV?\n\nA: \nI want to transmit the screen of my MacBook to these TVs so I can work in different apps, documents, code and watch movies.\n\nYou need a simple AirPlay compatible dongle plugged into the HDMI port of your TV.\nI have used several of these in different locations\n\n*\n\n*The work great for business presentations (i.e. PowerPoint) and simple animations\n\n*They work fairly well for playing standard definition video (i.e. YouTube or regular DVD).\n\n*It's marginal at best once you get to HD video (720p or 1080p)\n\n*If you want 4K, UHD, HDR, etc, you need an AppleTV.\n\n*It doesn't get around any copy protected (DRM) content; it won't play!\n\nFor their price point of sub $50 USD, they're a great little adapters to keep in your computer bag for when you go on client site for a presentation, training, or you just want to mirror to a larger screen.

This is not unique to this particular application but antivirus have similar sort of features. Any insight on how to achieve this..\n\nNote: Ours is an enterprise app that will be installed on machines owned by the companies and managed by IT but end users will have root access on their machine.\n\nA: \nThe aim is to prevent even root users from uninstalling our app on their mac.\n\nYou as a 3rd party developer can't prevent the root user or users with root privileges from uninstalling apps that they, technically, can install themselves.  What one one admin can do another can (un)do.\nThe core OS is protected by SIP and if using Catalina or later, the system volume is read only.  This is implemented at the very base layer and not at the application layer where you operate.\nIT, however, can manage permissions, rights, and roles through the use of MDM (Mobile Device Management) software.  Once a device is enrolled, IT will be able to create and enforce policies allowing/disallowing software use and installation.\nThis is for IT to manage, not the developer.\n\nA: You're going to have to disable SIP by rebooting into Recovery Mode, opening up a terminal window (click Utilities > Terminal in the menu bar), and typing \"csrutil disable.\" Then, reboot to get out of Recovery Mode and proceed to unload and delete the remaining kext files.\nAs of 10.15 (MacOS Catalina), kernel extensions have been put in the /System/Library folder and only mirrored (or symlinked) into the /Library folder. Thus, in order to change the system parameters, you'll have to disable the /System folder's protection (SIP) and then proceed to unload whatever kexts you don't want.\nBe sure to re-enable SIP after you're done (do the same thing as before, except type \"csrutil enable\" instead of \"csrutil disable\").\nAlso, a while back (on either MacOS El Capitain or MacOS Sierra, I don't remember which right now), it was possible to disable kexts using the same terminal window which you used to disable SIP (Recovery Mode) or Single User Mode.\nIn order to enter single user mode, reboot and hold down ⌘S while starting up.\nIn order to enter recovery mode, reboot and hold down ⌘R.\nI advise caution whenever dealing with system parameters; some may render the system unoperational, or at least some of the services that are offered could be severely hampered.\nAnother possible route would be through the installation of \"Provisioned Configuration Profiles\" which bypass/block internal processes (as if they'd be installed by an organization or an MDM).\n\nA: I do not recommend trying to lock down administrators. It’s much better to manage admin access, but if you insist you want to swim in the opposite direction from Apple, start with a product like DeepFreeze.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.faronics.com/products/deep-freeze/\nTheir Mac management solution is the best of you want to sacrifice the more efficient modern ways to control changes. Now, once you price out that software or underwrite a “built it again ourselves solution”, look again for Apple to partner and get acquainted with how well DEP and MDM work to achieve all of your goals and not just the unintentional modification of files issue.\nWhat you are after is MDM supervision and device enrollment. That is the efficient and modern way to secure corporate assets and as a benefit, your IT enrollments will be zero touch and enforced by Apple. Mojave and newer are quite well designed and Big Sur has some massive levers to further secure against file modification out of the box even without DEP+MDM.\n\n*\n\n*http://business.apple.com\n\n*https://www.apple.com/business/it/\nApple offers free advice and consulting to get any business started down this path and offers paid professional services any time you want first part support or enhanced services past the basic free accounts needed to properly secure all devices (Mac / iOS / iPadOS / tvOS / watchOS).\nBy enforcing code notarization and signing, you lock down all the modifications whether malicious or user generated.\n\nA: Kernel extensions (KEXTs) can prevent the system unloading them. As it's not always a good idea to unload a kernel extension currently in active use, it may freeze the entire system or panic the kernel if you do, a kernel extension is asked prior to unloading if it is okay with that and if it denies, the system won't unload it. Of course, a KEXT can simply always claim unloading would be a problem. So I cannot unload it from a running system.\nAnd a KEXT can hook itself into the file system API to monitor all file access and prevent certain kind of file operations, e.g. one that would delete the KEXT itself on disk or any user space helper tool (agent/daemon).\nSo on first glance, that system seems bulletproof. But it isn't. E.g. nothing stops me from booting into single user mode and delete the KEXT in that mode. Nothing stops me from booting the recovery system and deleting the KEXT on the main partition. Nothing stops me from booting from an external drive and delete the KEXT on the internal one. And once deleted, I can just boot the internal system normally and nothing will stop me from removing any other software I dislike.\nThis is just something maleware cannot easily do and also not without the user in front of the computer noticing it. So this stops malware and thus makes sense for a virus scanner but it doesn't stop a human being sitting in front of such a machine from doing it.\nEven SIP can only protect an actively running system. I can boot into recovery mode and tamper with any files I want, even those usually SIP protected. And SIP protection is not available to third party developers, it's a protection system intended do protect macOS itself from being tampered with by malware and hackers.\nAnd since KEXTs are obsolete with macOS 11 and the upcoming macOS 12, this is no solution I would even consider to begin with.\n", "Q: Where were the rock formations in the new wallpaper backgrounds from iOS 14.2 and macOS Big Sur photographed?

Today my iPad automatically updated its OS to 14.2 and it shows a prompt from Apple ID Security to enable two-factor authentication.\nThe message mentions that \"Some iOS features require two-factor authentication\", but I could not find which features exactly require it. The Apple's support page Two-factor authentication for Apple ID tells me what this two-factor authentication is and how it is important, but it doesn't say which features of the OS require it. There is only the same vague phrase without any details:\n\nCertain features in the latest versions of iOS and macOS require this\nextra level of security, which is designed to protect your\ninformation.\n...\nYou need two-factor authentication to use certain features that\nrequire improved security.\n\nI'd like to know exactly what features of iOS require two-factor authentication.\n\nA: All of them if you don’t have a grandfathered AppleID.

I only use it for video games. I recently built a PC for a better gaming experience and to free up space on my iMac. I am trying to retrieve my save files from the partition, but am getting a blue screen. There have been no changes made to my computer. One day I was gaming, the next day I get a blue screen.\nI typically do a full shutdown before booting into Windows. That acts just fine - I select windows and it starts up. I first know something is wrong because of how slow it starts up. Then, it attempts a Windows update, gets about 50%, and then blue screens.\nThe specific error message is: attempted write to readonly memory\nI knew bootcamp wasn’t the best option, but dang it if I don’t want to lose hours of gameplay.\nI see two options:\n\n*\n\n*fix the blue screen and get back into windows OR\n\n*retrieve files without accessing the partition (Guessing this is not feasible. That’s probably like getting something out of a box without opening the box.)\n\nBut I’m not even sure where to start.\n\nA: Actually your second choice is a bit odd but possibly the way to go.\nmacOS will certainly read (not write) from/to the default Windows 10 partition format, NTFS.\nYou should be able to access that partition and, assuming you know what to look for, copy the needed save files from your games to a flash drive to then transfer to your PC.\nAnd depending on how \"hands on\" you are, you could theoretically remove the iMacs internal drive, stick it in an external USB enclosure and access the drive from your new Windows PC. Assuming it's not a fusion drive.\nThere are also utilities that will back up the Boot Camp partition, and presumably you might then be able to restore it to an external drive and access it from the new PC. That would depend on the software you use to do that and how it restores any backups it creates.\nAll of this depends on the Boot Camp partition being largely intact. you say nothing about that, just that it blue screens.\nAlso if you have a bootable Windows 10 flash drive (like the one Boot Camp created, you could boot from that and repair Windows. I use Windows 10 install media all the time to repair a blue screen error.\nBut there is absolutely no way to get the data off the partition without accessing it. As to get the data off of it (no matter how) you must access the partition.\nHopefully this gives you some starting points for avenues to recover your data.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 won't restore No matter what I try, it always goes into recovery mode (Connect to iTunes screen) after restoring the device. The progress bar under the Apple logo becomes full, the device reboots, then it goes back into recovery mode. Same issue when trying DFU restore.

No dice.\n\nA: I got it working by using Pwned DFU Mode (iPwnder32) and idevicerestore with an IPSW.\n", "Q: Can’t connect to Time Capsule in recovery mode (Big Sur) I made a big mistake and updated some Python packages with Homebrew on my 2015 MacBook Pro, MacOS 11.0.1. The updates caused many issues with my preferred IDE, PyCharm. Of course, I made a backup on my Time Capsule prior to updating with Homebrew. So, after being frustrated and getting nowhere with PyCharm, I decided to restore from my backup. I entered into recovery mode by holding CMD + R while restarting. When I went to restore from backup, I could not connect to my Time Capsule. The prompt stated, “There was a problem connecting to the server.” Any ideas on how to get the MacBook to connect to the Time Capsule?\n\nA: After over an hour on the phone with Apple, it was suggested I try to use Migration Assistant to restore from backup. That worked for me.\nEDIT: While it did work, there was a major issue: While trying to run Python/Jupyter in PyCharm, I repeatedly get malware warnings that have to be manually suppressed, individually. I mean, every file associated with a Python package in the virtual environment seems to be identified as possible malware. I called Apple about the issue, but no one knew how to globally suppress the malware warnings. There are way too many files to manually suppress them all.\nI found an alternative, create a new project in PyCharm, copy in Python/Jupyer files (not packages, but files I created), then add the packages needed to run everything.\n\nA: I unfortunately have no real solution but as I recently also installed Big Sur on a MacBook Pro Late 2013 and wanted to revert back to Catalina. I got the exact same error message “There was a problem connecting to the server.” when trying to connect to the Time Capsule through recovery (CMD+R mode) - (also shown by me as NAOpensession failed for afp:// ... - Error 22) in the log window when seeing extra details.\nI later made a copy of the sparsebundle (from the Time Capsule) to an external hdd and could make it further through the recovery screens. (I didn't finalize the steps as I later read Big Sur may brick 2013 MacBook and didn't want to take any more risks - but it looks like I could have made the complete recovery through the hdd with the same backup copied from the TM). This may be a potential temporary alternative\nI also did further testing my on wife's laptop (still on Catalina) and she received the same error (There was a problem connecting to the server...).\nI suspect the bug may not be new to Big Sur.\nI also made a hard factory reset of the Time Capsule and made two new backups that are working and are verified perfectly on Big Sur itself, but once in recovery mode it fails to connect to it.\nRegards\n\nA: „NAOpensession failed for afp:// ... - Error 22“ is also the case for Big Sur 11.1.\nI needed to go down to the shipped os for this machine (10.10) and then back to catalina again to gain access to the backup. From catalina I could sucessfully recover the Timecapsule Backup.\nMy recommendation is to have a big usb3 thumbdrive at hand and format it as startup drive, that can spare a bit of this trouble. https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT201372\nSadly one can not choose which specific version of Mac OS the internet recovery loads, only the one from hardware production time and the last installed, which is Big Sur when you have the problem.\nThe Problem itself is unrelated to Python or Homebrew, i needed a backup after the Mac Server app forgot it´s settings.\n", "Q: How can I see where Photos.app thinks the System Photo Library is? I have about 8 photo libraries, all of them on a [connected and mounted] external disk. One of them is the System Photo Library, but which one? I have forgotten.\nSince I upgraded to Big Sur, Photos.app is saying it cannot find the System Photo Library. Apparently, Photos.app is looking for it in some place where it is not.\nI would like to know where it is looking, and what is the name of the library it is looking for, so that I can point it to its correct location.\nNecessarily, Photos.app has this information stored somewhere. Where?\n\nA: In Photos if you go to preferences (⌘ + ,) under General there are some library location settings:\n\nIn order to find out where System Photo Library is and to change it just hold ⌥ while opening Photos. You will be presented window with needed controls:\n\nRefer to Apple documentation for needed steps: Designate a System Photo Library in Photos\n\nA: I was also having trouble determining which photo library was the Systems Library. In my case I did not have one designated, so that's another issue that I address later in this post.\nUsing Ventura 13.2, if a Systems Library is designated this will be shown indirectly with the \"Use as Systems Photo Library\" button under-intensified in Photos > Settings > General.\n\nYou can also find it by opening Photos with Opt and \"(SystemsPhoto Library)\" will be displayed next to the library.\n\nBut if you're not seeing this you don't have a library designated as your Systems Library. I had this issue when storing my library on an external hard drive. An Apple Senior Advisor fixed it by following this order of operations:\n\n*\n\n*Apple > System Settings > Apple ID (top of side bar) > iCloud, Turn off Photos slider.\n\n*Shut down and reopen in Safe Mode by holding the power key.\n\n*Click on the internal hard drive, usually \"Macintosh HD\".\n\n*Login and open Photos. You should be opening the Photos Library you want as your Systems Library.\n\n*Open Photos > Settings and select the Use as Systems Photo Library button. It should change to be under-intensified.\n\n*Log out and restart normally.\n\nThis worked for me and allowed the designation of a Photos Library on an external hard drive as the Systems Library, which also enabled iCloud storage and using Shared Albums from this Photos Library. Good luck.\n\nA: I don't know if you're still having this problem, as the OP was almost two years ago. I'm having a different problem with Photos but stumbled across this post. Are any of your 8 libraries called \"Photos Library\"? I believe this is the default library that Photos will look for. Unless you've reset the System Photos Library (sounds like you have not done that yet), this should be the one, and it should reside in your Pictures folder on your Mac.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Do iPhones sold in the US support dual physical SIMs?

Or will it be drawing power from the outlet?\nI'm wondering about battery performance (cycles) since the device would be on most of the day and it would need to charged often.\n\nA: The iPad is always powered from the battery. It doesn't matter whether the charger is plugged in or not, the power is always drawn from the battery.\nThis is actually essential in ensuring that a sudden spike in power consumption (for example due to briefly engaging the CPU and GPU at 100%) doesn't result in system shutdown because the charger cannot supply enough power.\nOfcourse when the charger is plugged in, the battery is charged at the same time. If the power draw is less than the charger output, then the battery will be charged (until it reaches max) - otherwise you can still experience that the battery level drops while using the iPad.\n\nA: I've used my iPhone being constantly plugged-in for development and screen on-time for many hours a day As a result my battery's overall health degraded insanely fast.\nMost likely iPads don't overcome this issue, so I would say its best to not use Sidecar that often (to work as a permanent second monitor) or really use it unplugged, let it discharge, and then charge up again, preferably when not using.\n", "Q: Mysterious folders that appeared in Documents on upgrade to Big Sur After upgrading to Big Sur today (from macOS 10.14 Mojave) on my 2018 MacBook Air 13\", I found a number of unwelcome new folders had appeared in my Documents folder (when viewed with Finder).\nThese folders are:\n\n*\n\n*GarageBand\n\n*Keynote\n\n*Numbers\n\n*Pages\n\n*Preview\n\n*QuickTime Player\n\n*TextEdit\n\nEach one, except Preview and TextEdit, contains a single Alias file called \"iChats\". The Preview and TextEdit folders are empty. Needless to say, I cannot open the iChats files.\nI do not want these folders, but I can't move them to somewhere else, unlike my own genuine folders: a circle with a slash through it appears if I try.\nSo I thought I would look using Terminal, but cd Documents and then ls -a shows only my own files and directories. These unwanted interlopers are nowhere to be seen.\nEdit: Some more information:\nFollowing the advice of Joy Jin, I dragged each folder onto a Terminal window, to see what was revealed. The folders appear in Terminal as follows (every path begins with\n/Users/davidhoadley/Library/Containers/ - I have edited that text out of each item below:\n\n*\n\n*... com.apple.garageband10/Data/Documents\n\n*... com.apple.iWork.Keynote/Data/Documents\n\n*... com.apple.iWork.Numbers/Data/Documents\n\n*... com.apple.iWork.Pages/Data/Documents\n\n*... com.apple.Preview/Data/Documents\n\n*... com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Documents\n\nIn answer to user3439894, yes, I can right-click and Move to Trash. But what then appears in the trash is the com.apple.(whatever)/Data/ folder, with several subfolders (i.e. not simply the folder from Documents that I described above). I do not know what these folders do, and I am afraid that if I delete them or send them to the trash, I will somehow adversely affect the running of the relevant applications.\nSo the folders appear to be some kind of link or alias. But they are not a unix-style hard link or a symbolic link, because they don't appear in the directory as seen from Terminal using the ls -a command.\nSo my question now becomes: is it safe to send them to the trash? And if anyone has any clues as to what the mechanism is that shows me these links/aliases/whatever they are, I would be most interested.\n\nA: All of those folders could easily come from iCloud documents sync. You are correct to be cautious deleting them. I would be sure iCloud is signed out (or at least you don’t enable document sync) before trying to delete these.\nWe can’t really look at your iCloud settings, so a chat or call with Apple support would be prudent if you don’t see right away what happened to be sure you do not delete iCloud data.\n\nA: Finder now shows documents belonging to some sandboxed applications.\nNo other application shows these extra folders.  In particular Terminal commands and Finder replacements, like Path Finder and ForkLift, do not show the folders.\nThe folders are only present in Finder when an application has put data in the ~/Library/Containers/app/Data/Documents folder.\nThe applications I see in ~/Documents all have content in iCloud Drive though the files in iCloud Drive are not the same as in Finder.\nIn my case, I see the pseudo-folders for 3rd party applications like BBEdit, iThoughtsX.\nThis behaviour seems to be designed to mimic the behaviour of the Files application in iOS.\nThere is no known way to turn off this behaviour.  But I would be glad to shown wrong on this.\nIt is not a good idea to just delete the folders or the files in them. Deleting the files is likely to cause problems when using the applications because the content has been created by the application.\nMy solution is to create a new folder ~/MyDocuments and put all my documents in there.  That leaves ~/Documents for Apple to manipulate.\nIf you dislike this behaviour, submit feedback to Apple.\n", "Q: InstallerSandboxes directory eating up disk space My MacBook hard drive is full. I have tried some common methods such as emptying the Trash and rebooting in Safe Mode, but these haven't helped. So I ran a Perl script with root privileges via sudo which adds up file sizes, and I found that the InstallerSandboxes directory is eating up most of my disk space.\nIt can be found on multiple locations, so I suppose it's hardlinked. It has a .PKInstallSandboxManager subdirectory which contains 4 subdirectories with names in format: *SOME-UUID*.activeSandbox. They all have huge sizes: 16.42GB, 18.72GB, 18.76GB and 29.27GB, all of which add up to 83.19GB.\nAll of them contain a Root/Application/Xcode.app so I suppose they are all related to Xcode which is installed on my device (I have an /Application/Xcode.app too).\nI don't suppose all 4 of them are in use, how can I get rid of the ones that aren't in use?\n\nA: I've originally added the question because I didn't have enough space to update XCode. I ended up removing then reinstalling it. But things have gotten worse, last time I uninstalled it and then I got the error that I can't reinstall it because there isn't enough space. So desperate times call for desperate measures, I have deleted the 4 directories mentioned in the question which gave me 30GB extra space. I did it with sudo an mc and mc reported it deleted around 1400000 files, it's ridiculous! So then I could reinstall XCode and it seems to be working without problems.\nEdit:\nTo free up additional space go to About This Mac > Storage > Manage > Developer. In there XCode Caches was 15Gb on my computer. You can delete it and the next time XCode runs it will recreate some of it but only a couple GBs.\n", "Q: How to change syntax coloring for JavaScript files in Automator Dark Mode?

I would suggest that you try the same and also with any other devices you have connected.\nI also had a similar issue with Catalina as well which was related to the external monitor's audio driver and my bluetooth headset. which caused issues with shutdowns and sleep mode often leading to Kernel panic reports when I booted up the following day.\nIt is most likely a software bug, however, can begotten around physisically.\n\nA: The process to isolate kernel panics is the same on all recent macOS releases.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553\n\n*Big sur kernel panics\nIt can be work, so keep good notes of dates and times so when it’s time to figure out if it’s software or accessories or software, you spend less time doing the work needed to pinpoint the cause.\n", "Q: Macos login from terminal (Terminal/iTerm) takes long time with high CPU When I open the terminal (iTerm/Terminal), login process consumes %100 cpu and waits for 1-2 minutes before the shell appears.\nI have been googling for some time, I tried to remove asl files, reset user permissions, used custom login command with hushlogin flags...

I would like to ship a MacBook Air (M1 model released in 2020) from Japan to South Korea via EMS, but the EMS website says it is not possible to send a machine that has more than 2 lithium-ion batteries.\nHow many lithium-ion batteries the M1 MacBook Air contain? Also, does the adapter that one finds in the box have any lithium-ion batteries?\n\nA: From the iFixIt teardown of the new Air, it looks like there's 2 li-ion batteries, one on each side.\n\nWhen I look at the Apple technical specs, it states:\n\nBattery and Power\n\n*\n\n*Up to 15 hours wireless web\n\n*Up to 18 hours Apple TV app movie playback\n\n*Built-in 49.9‑watt‑hour lithium‑polymer battery\n\n*30W USB-C Power Adapter\n\n\nI take this mean there's a single battery as it's written 'battery' and not 'batteries'.  Maybe this is just one battery that's split in two, I don't know.  Maybe others here who are more knowledgeable on this can edit this answer to add that info.  Either way, I'm sure these are built in such a way as to be shippable to South Korea by major carriers.\nI can't find any info on a battery in the power adapter.  My guess is that there isn't a battery in there.\n\nA: The answer is zero batteries in the adapter and the assembled laptop qualifies as UN 3481 product for shipping purposes.\n\nThe M1 Air has a built-in 49.9‑watt‑hour lithium‑polymer battery, so it falls under UN 3481, Section II IMP:ELI\n\nTo elaborate, you are shipping a computer (portable electronic equipment) that contains one battery with multiple cells and this assembly is regulated differently than loose batteries included in a box (or spare parts for repair of an Air).\nHere is the relevant section from a 30 page guide from UPS.  Ask your carrier how they define portable electronic equipment if you are not sure if the shipping standard I have quoted doesn’t govern EMS website or staff.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.ups.com/media/en/lithium_batteries_guidance.pdf\n\n", "Q: Sometimes right-clicking on magic mouse does not work I'm using Mac and magic mouse.\nLeft-clicking on the mouse always works. But sometimes, when I right click on the magic mouse, it just does not work. So I have to right click again or again and again.\nIt was not very very harmful, but now I'm making videos and recording screens, everything needs to be perfect. So I'm wondering why sometimes my right-clicking does not work. Is it the way I right-click wrong?\nHas anyone experienced the same problem?\n\nA: I have that problem too. You are not right-clicking on the correct position on your mouse. You should play with it and make a note or put a mark on your mouse to show where on the mouse you need to press to get a right-click. I found placing your finger on the right side of the mouse near the edge and towards to top works best for me.\n", "Q: MacOS limit Spotlight results to .app files I have already limited Spotlight search to Applications inside System Preferences > Spotlight\nHowever, this seems to actually just limit searches to the directory /Applications.\nIt means there are results from application files, configuration files, etc..\nIs it possible to limit Spotlight search results to the .app file extension?\nUsing macOS Catalina (10.15.7).\n\nA: If you invoke Spotlight (⌘ + space) and enter search term followed by kind:app you will see only applications (and 'Related searches' block with 'Search the Web' and 'Search in Finder' options)\n\nRefer to Apple support document Search by the type of items to find item types you can use to narrow Spotlight search results.\n\nA: If you initiate your search from Finder (rather than Cmd + Space), after typing your search name you can add criteria using the + button on the right side:\n\nand then filter by \"Kind\" is \"Application.\" If you want to filter to items named \"*.app\": on my screenshot where the dropdown box is \"Kind,\" scroll down and select \"Other\", then choose \"File Extension\", and you can do this:\n\n(Filtering by \"Name\" is \"*.app\" did not produce the same result for me.)\n\nA: Interesting. I saw your clarification; you want Spotlight to only search apps, always, or to default to that, and you can opt out?\nI don't think you can, directly, but you could record an Automator flow that launches Spotlight, adds the appropriate kind:app, and then change the system keyboard shortcut to point to your flow.\nIt really depends on what you are trying to do. Spotlight searches are quite valuable for documents, are you sure you want to give that up?\nAlso, have you considered using Alfred or something like it, instead?\n", "Q: Closing Macbook lid changes external screen to primary I've recently got a new Macbook with Big Sur and I'm observing some different behaviour compared to my old Macbook with Catalina.\nI have an external monitor connected as a secondary display and I have a video player streaming on full-screen on it. When I close the lid, on Catalina my video keeps playing on the external secondary display, however on my new laptop when I close the lid the external display turns into primary, and I'm seeing my laptop's windows rather than the video.\nAny ideas what might be causing this?\n\nA: Again, another stab at the dark here:\nEither:\n(Easy route) remove the monitor's cable from the computer/ or manually put it to sleep OR\nopen up your terminal and write the command\n'pmset -g'\nit will display your current power management settings.\nfrom then on you could try disabling lidwake, acwake or messing around with the gpu switch option(though, honestly i think its only related to either enforcing dedicated or external/separate internal gpu settings ).\nAlso, try disabling the darkwake option.(which is not listed within pmset's man pages but you can google your way thru understanding it)\npmset -c darkwake 0\n\n*\n\n*Note: all pmset values require sudo access\n\n\nA: This is, somewhat, by design - you are able to use your laptop as a computer completely independently of its own peripherals; just as you would with a Mac Mini, by simply closing the lid.\nThe simple answer is to unplug your laptop from the wall outlet, which disables this mode.\nSee below:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834\n", "Q: iCloud TextEdit folder not visible on icloud.com service (stuck in uploading state) I have enabled on my Mac the iCloud Drive and its TextEdit folder where I uploaded one specific file, but if I login to icloud.com icloud drive I don't see this folder there.

Signed into her account on Mac Mini, I have successfully signed into her account in Apple ID in System Preferences, and into iCloud too.\nWhen I open the Messages app, it prompts for credentials. I enter her creds (that I just created), and all seems to go well. I tried sending a message to my account, which was never delivered. Then, within a matter of seconds, the app appears to either restart or decides that authentication needs to be re-performed, almost like her account is being logged out. This repeats no matter how many times I try, or whether I restart the machine.\nIf I log into my Mac account, open Messages and log in with my Apple ID, the same thing happens. When I just tried, it lasted seven seconds before restarting.\nIf I open Messages using my Apple ID on a 2018 Macbook Pro, also running Big Sur, everything is fine and I can send messages to friends with iPhones, using their phone number. Similarly if I log in as her account on my MBP, I can send messages.\nIf I try to send a message to my child's account using my MBP, I get \"Not delivered\" errors.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: What i can recommend for you is to download “iMessage debug” Its a terminal Applcation,just unzip it and double click it to run in the terminal. You will have to goto system preferences and click on the security and privacy icon and allow it to run because it will blocked because of the “unidentified developer crap” But anyhow just run that and see if that fixes your problem. If there was a known good imessage configuration on the said Mac at one point then this app will be able to restore that configuration automatically. Your ethernet in your Hardware config will have to read as “en0” and “built in”. And your nvram must be working as well. In terminal you would type the command “sudo -s” enter your password and then “sudo nvram -p” hit enter. “sudo nvram -c” now type “sudo nvram mymac=1234” where 1234 can be whatever you want to put there and then just hit enter. Then reboot and then go back to terminal and just type “sudo nvram -p” and it should bring up some data on the screen along with whatever you named the 1234 above and that way you will know if your nvram is working. If it doesnt show the 1234 rename then its not working and that would be the problem. Anyway hope this helps\n", "Q: Macbook Air Full Factory Reset? I want to reset my Macbook Air Early 2015 but not just simply deleting the disk and reinstall it with macOS Utilities menu. What I mean is \"full factory reset.\" I want it to be like it just left the factory, at least in the software side. Like SMC and NVRAM reset etc. Or deleting the disk resets the things that I mentioned?\nIf not, when should I reset them? After deleting the disk and before installing the High Sierra (I will downgrade from Mojave to High Sierra) or after installing the High Sierra?\nAnd are there any other things that can be reset like SMC and NVRAM? If there are, please mention them.\n\nA: There are so many terms used in the question that indicate a misunderstanding of what a \"full factory reset\" is.\nFirst off, your MacBook Air (or any computer and not limited to Apple) is not a phone;  there's no \"factory reset.\"  In fact, \"full factory reset\" is not correct either.  You can \"reset to factory defaults\" which is a term used for wiping the custom configurations of your device so that it will behave like it was just removed from the box.  It doesn't, however, return it to the OS/firmware that it originally shipped with.  If you applied any firmware updates, you can't roll those back - and it wouldn't be prudent to do so.\n\nI want it to be like it just left the factory, at least in the software side. Like SMC and NVRAM reset etc.\n\nThe SMC and NVRAM have absolutely nothing to do with software.  The SMC handles power, battery charging, fan control, etc.  There's nothing in the SMC that has anything to do with how you personally interact with your computer; there's no identifiable information.  The NVRAM sets your pre-boot environment variables and your Find My Mac token.  There's nothing in NVRAM that's personally identifiable and necessary of resetting.\nI wrote an a short piece on what Resetting the SMC and NVRAM actually does. (it's part of a broader answer).  It's not necessary to reset either of these.\n\nOr deleting the disk resets the things that I mentioned?\n\nNo. I assume you mean erasing your disk.  Your disk contents has nothing to do with the SMC.  As far as your NVRAM goes, pretty much the only entries in NVRAM related to your disk is where the the boot and recovery partitions are located and this info rarely changes from computer to computer.  You could reset it, but it will likely go back to what it was before.\n\nAfter deleting the disk and before installing the High Sierra (I will downgrade from Mojave to High Sierra) or after installing the High Sierra?\n\nWhy downgrade?  Most users would want to know that the Mac runs the latest and greatest operating system, not one from three years ago (2017).  However, if you want to go this route, all you have to do is boot using the keyboard combo ⇧ Shift⌘ Command⌥ OptionR.  This will install the version of macOS that came with your Mac or the closest version still available (this one reason is why \"full factory reset\" is not applicable to computers).\nSee:  How to reinstall macOS from macOS Recovery\nTL;DR\n\nAnd are there any other things that can be reset like SMC and NVRAM? If there are, please mention them.\n\nAs mentioned, SMC and NVRAM reset are useless - doing this will accomplish nothing.  It won't hurt anything if you do so, if you feel better doing it, have at it.  I just want to make you aware that these resets, that are way too often cited, aren't very relevant.\nWhat you should do is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you've backed up your data\n\n\n*Sign out of iTunes/Music (de-authorize your computer), iCloud, Messaging, etc.\n\n\n*Remove any accounts you may have added (like Mail, Exchange, Social networking, etc.)\n\n\n*Unpair any Bluetooth devices you may have connected\n\n\n*Remove any firmware and File Vault encryption passwords you may have enabled\n\n\n*Wipe your drive and reinstall macOS\n\n*\n\n*⌘ CommandR - Install the latest macOS version installed with your Mac\n\n*⇧ Shift⌘ Command⌥ OptionR - Install the version that came with or closest to when your Mac was shipped from the factory\n\n*Before proceeding with the installation of  macOS, use Disk Utility from the Recovery Boot Menu to wipe your drive\n\n\n\n*Turn off your computer once you get to the \"Welcome\" screen.  When the new user gets it and turns it on for the first time, they will get the \"new computer experience\" like it came from the factory.\nThe key is to un-link your Mac from you both physically and online.  Removing firmware and File Vault passwords will ensure the new user can use the Mac without going back to you for them.  Wiping the drive ensures your data is gone and not just \"hidden\" in a different user account.  Removing online links (i.e. iCloud) ensures the new user can link it to their account and keeps you and your data out of the mix.\n\nA: Here is the checklist for a full reset of a Mac.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065\nIt covers most of the accounts people tend to forget. Yes, you do want to turn of FileVault to encrypt all data. Then do the cryptographic erase, install from recovery to upgrade all firmware with the latest OS.\n", "Q: How to disable or change an application's shortcut? I have an app (Skitch) that has a seemingly unchangable shortcut of command-shift-5 for capturing the screen. I'd like to disable this or, at least, change it to another shortcut.\nPreviously I could go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts and add an app with its accompanying shortcut there. For example, I tried to change it to the following:\n\nUnfortunately in this instance command-shift-5 retains its function whenever the app is open and in the background in Catalina.\nSkitch appears to capture this keyboard setting even when the key binding is disabled for the normal macOS keybinding for \"Screenshot and recording options\":\n\nIs there a way to stop Skitch from receiving this shortcut and/or assigning it another shortcut that works?\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it by changing the key combination of my Mac.\nTo change the shortcut, you must click directly in the column of the key combination. Then it will change to an input field. Now click the new key combination on your keyboard, and your mac will change the key combination for this shortcut.\n\nUPDATE: If you have a look at the last option in my screenshot, \"App Shortcut\" with this you can define an other shortcut for something in the menubar. But it will properly only work if Skitch is in focus then.\n\nA: shift-command-5 is a macOS keyboard shortcut, not any particular application like Skitch.\nChange or disable it in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Screenshots.\n\n\nA: Notwithstanding a couple other unsatisfactory workarounds presented in answers here, the only workaround I know of that achieves your goal of using the OS X shortcut free of Skitch's double bind is just to close the Skitch app. Skitch only has that shortcut wired while the app is running.\nI stumbled upon an app called Custom Shortcuts that might let you override the Skitch shortcut. Worth a try; if it works, please update so the rest of us can use to achieve the same goal. :)\n", "Q: How do I import my iPhone Mail imap account settings to my Macbook Mail client?

I have an external drive for use on a Linux system, and would like to read it on macOS (High Sierra).\nThe drive is encrypted (I have the password).\nIs possible?\n\nA: Natively?  Definitely not.  F2FS was developed by Samsung for use on Linux.  I don't know of any mainstream Linux distros that support this out of the box either.  From the cursory research I've done, it can be added to the kernel to support it at compile time.\nTo get this support on macOS, you'll need to add support using Fuse much like you add support for any of the 3rd party file systems.  Currently, it's not listed as supported by Fuse.\nWhat you might want to try is to load up a VM running Linux with F2FS support enabled then create a USB Device Filter to immediately mount it on the VM and not mount it on the macOS host.

Shortly after updating to macOS v11 (Big Sur), I see:\n\n\n\"Google Chrome.app\" would like to use Bluetooth.\nOnce Chrome has access, websites will be able to ask you for access.\n\nWhy does Chrome need Bluetooth?\n\nA: The official Google Support mentioned some of the Bluetooth usages on Chrome:\n\n*\n\n*Connect a website to a Bluetooth or USB device\n\nChrome lets you connect a website to your Bluetooth and USB devices. For example, if you have a Bluetooth-enabled heart monitor, you can let a website connect to it. Then, the page can record and show information about the monitor.\n\njksoegaard's answer explains this in more detail.\n\n\n*Use your phone's built-in security key\n\nYou can use 2-Step Verification to help protect your account from hackers, even if they’ve stolen info like your password. You can set up your phone’s built-in security key to safely sign in on Chrome OS, iOS, macOS, and Windows 10 devices.\n\nWhen a supported Android, iPhone, or iPad device is added as a security key, Chrome will prompt the user to turn on Bluetooth on both the host machine (e.g. macOS) and the phone when logging into your Google account.\n\nUse your phone's built-in key to sign in to new devices\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Bluetooth is turned on for both devices.\n\n*[...]\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n\nA: Modern Web APIs allow web sites to run code that communicates with your Bluetooth devices using the Web Bluetooth API - after you have given permission in each specific instance.\nThis particular prompt gives Chrome access to Bluetooth, which is necessary for Chrome to be able to offer that functionality to web sites.\nYou can find some technical examples of Bluetooth usage made possible by the Web Bluetooth API here:\nWeb Bluetooth Samples\nIn regards to actual use, it could be useful for controlling almost any kind of Bluetooth-enabled device. Imagine for example a new smart home device that you could setup by visiting a web site - instead of having to install an app or similar. Other examples could be RFID scanners, receipt printers, busy-lights, and so on.\nHere's a GitHub repository with code examples for various fun demos:\nWeb Bluetooth Demos\nFor example, it includes controlling racing cars, a toy plane, a receipt printer and an LED pixel display.\n\nA: Chrome doesn’t need this access, but it wants it for sure or it wouldn’t have asked Apple SDK to grant access to the hardware.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210578\n\n\n*Apple started warning people on iOS quite a while back since this access is elevated past what is needed for accessories like headphones to work.\n\n\n*Clearly some developers and people intercepting otherwise legitimate traffic have abused this access. Now that privacy warning is added to macOS.\n\n\n*This is part of Apple ensuring that developers have to ask us before\nthey gather information from devices.\nGoogle does make money selling targeted advertisements, so gathering this can enhance their services. You could have specific needs for Chrome to access bluetooth drivers directly, but since there are privacy implications granting Bluetooth access to any application Apple went to lengths to alert you before that happens.\nSome apps try to do local device discovery for chromecast or other local devices to collaborate with rather than using AirPlay API to locate remote screens and speakers.\nDo some research if you’re not comfortable with yielding such localized information as 100 % of the Bluetooth beacons/devices/products in range of your computer to apps. This sort of collection is one very lucrative part of the industrial advertising complex to generate and sell location-specific data. Yes, most responsible companies then try to anonymize the data, but if you don’t collect it, it can’t be leaked or abused. Not all apps are designed to collect and sell this private data, but some are.\nTo reiterate, you don’t ever need to grant this for mouse, audio, microphone access since apps can use proper API for those functions. This prompt grants full access to the entire Bluetooth stack to use Bluetooth radio data and scan your paired devices and location traffic.\nI say no to these until it’s clear I need it for a specific task.\n", "Q: Big sur kernel panics After updating to macOS 11, aka Big Sur, my Mac has kept crashing every ~2 hours. Here's the kernel panic log from one recent panic\nHere is another panic log.\nI initially thought the issue was related to a Dell DisplayLink docking station I had connected to, but I have uninstalled the driver and I have also experienced crashes without any peripherals attached.\nAny help reading and understanding a kernel panic log would be much appreciated.\nI should note that the install process of big sur was a bit strange with several reboots and clicking \"update\" again. Not sure if that means anything.\nI'm on a 2017 15\" MacBook Pro with touchpad, i7 and intel graphics.\n\nA: As of 11.3 and 11.3.1 I'm not experiencing many panics on the M1 Macbook air.\npreviously:\nCurrently this is a game of whack-a-mole with Big Sur. I've been seeing repeated kernel panics 2 days into 11.2 and the previous 11.1. I've now largely adjusted my workflow to accommodate regular crashing to manage work loss and expect this to remain true for at least several point releases (11.x) given the slow progress--just my guess. Hardware checks reveal no issues and report all good.\nAs with notable software updates from Apple the past several years this reveals a significant systemic weakness of the company. LinkedIn was recently hiring for head of software and Google Project Zero is revealing related security issues and improvements, so both directly and indirectly seeing that simply adapting to the shortcomings is the norm with Apple products moving forward.\n\nA: Your panics repeatedly occur in IOAcceleratorFamily, which is the graphics driver. Panics with this specific signature are overwhelmingly the result of a bug in macOS, not anything that you’re doing wrong. Debugging this fully requires Apple internal tools and engineering expertise, not to mention access to the code. You won’t be able to fix this yourself (although you might stumble upon a workaround, such as a full erase-install) because this isn’t the user’s fault.\nYour best bet is to file a bug report and provide Apple with detailed information to help reproduce and root-cause your issue. This will include collecting a sysdiagnose immediately after you reboot from a crash ($ sysdiagnose in Terminal or CommandOptionControlShift. from any app). Then you can file the bug via the Apple Developer bug reporter if you have a developer account or through Feedback Assistant if you don’t. If you file a good report, you will either work indirectly with an Apple engineer if this is a novel bug or have your data be added to the pool of existing reports for this same issue. Apple will then work to make a fix and roll it into the earliest software update that it can.\n\nA: Apple has an excellent guide to starting to resolve or at least narrow what causes panics.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553\nWhen a panic is induced by a device injecting bad data, you may have to triage while troubleshooting. Is it a cable, a controller board on a display, a hubs that increases the frequency. Eventually, Apple may patch the system to catch the error condition before it’s acted on by the kernel - but that presumes their engineers analyze the sysdiagnose logs for your specific crash (or one fundamentally similar to yours).\n", "Q: Are vintage devices compatible with iCloud?

I have a list of URLs saved in a text file separated by spaces, and I would like to download every single one to my iPad as a zip file.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: There are at least a couple of ways. Unfortunately there is no command line interface on iPadOS so WGET is going to be impossible to use. And unless the text file is ENORMOUS there is no need to zip the text file, though there are zip utilities for iOS.\niCloud allows for the synchronization of data between apps on both the Mac, iPhone and iPad. If you have iCloud drive you could paste the URLs into a pages.app document and save it there. Then you can open it on pages.app on your iPad.\nIf, like me, you don't have iCloud drive set up you can log into iCloud.com on your Mac and paste that text into a new notes document. This will then sync to all of your iCloud devices, including your iPad.\nIf you have a blog you can upload the text file to the blog and then go to that file on your iPad:\nhttp://myblogwebaddress.com/textfileiwant.txt\nAlso if you have iCloud drive you can put the file in one of your iCloud folders and then use the files.app on your iPad to access the text file.\nThere are other ways but, hopefully, that will get you started.\n\nA: You can use wget CLI program.\nwget -i text_file.txt\n\n", "Q: How to fix run-time error 53 every time I open a file in MS Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on Big Sur?

Using Windows in Boot Camp, I'm able to get the extended mode closing the lid, but on macOS, I can't.\nAny suggestions (except using two adapters, which is very uncomfortable and it's the reason why I bought this new adapter)?\n\nA: The dock you have bought operates over USB-C and requires MST support from the operating system in order to do extended mode on the connected monitors. MST is not supported in macOS, both it is in Windows. This is why it works in BootCamp, but not in macOS.\nThe Amazon product page you link to actually contain this information. If you look at the illustrations, you'll see that the monitors connected to a Windows PC shows different content on each monitor - whereas the monitors connected to the Mac shows the same content on both monitors.\nIn order to solve this you need to connect the second monitor with a cable directly to the MacBook Pro instead of through the dock - or by replacing the dock with a Thunderbolt 3 dock. Those docks do not require MST in order to function, as they work with Thunderbolt display multiplexing instead.\n", "Q: How do I view full process paths in Activity Monitor?

If I share a video file via iMessage, the recipient doesn't get the exact file I've shared, but a converted version of the video, which has a lower resolution and lower quality (e.g. when I share a 1080p H.265 video, iMessage actually sends a 300p H.264 blurry mess.)\nIs there a way to make iMessage share a video without re-encoding it? What are the technical criteria that video files have to meet in order to be spared re-encoding? (codecs, profiles, resolution, file size)\nI know I could share a URL to a file hosted elsewhere, but I want to have end-to-end encryption, and I don't want to require the recipient to perform any unusual steps or leave iMessage to view the video.\n\nA: I don’t think we get to directly influence this.\nFor my threat model, I’m not super concerned if iCloud and Apple can decrypt the attachments stored in iCloud, so I typically save the video to iCloud shared photo album and share a link. If you’re sharing copyright content or something you don’t wish the government to get at via a cell carrier I understand not wanting to upload that to a server.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204042\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/imessage-overview-secd9764312f/web\nAlso, be sure your carrier settings are updated, some carriers influenced sending quality in the past, but I haven’t seen that happen lately in the US.\nThe function of iCloud and Messages/FaceTime varies greatly based on what region your device was sold and what region you associate your AppleID.

This means that the kernel (the core of the operating system) tried to access memory addresses that aren't mapped to physical RAM.\nThe cause of this is an invalid pointer. A pointer is basically a number stored in RAM that works as an address and \"points to\" a different piece of the system memory.\nInvalid pointers can be caused by software bugs. However, a bug that causes a kernel panic every 2-3 minutes no matter the activity would almost certainly have been discovered by other users. Those type of software bugs that cause kernel panics are usually triggered by a specific action (such as inserting an external peripheral), and not something just happening randomly.\nIf you have third party kernel extensions installed - disable them to test if they have any part in the kernel panic. It is also a good idea to boot up in Recovery Mode and confirm that the kernel panics also happen here, in order to rule out third party software as a cause.\nInvalid pointers can also be caused by defective RAM. This I think is the most common cause for invalid pointers happening \"randomly\" in kernel space with a production kernel.\nThere are also other, less common, causes of invalid pointers, such as for example a defective CPU, a damaged memory bus, and defective PCIe DMA units.\n", "Q: Apple News Remove Topic I currently subscribed to Apple One and I'm on macOS 11.0.1.  I never used Apple News prior to subscribing so this is my first experience with it and trying to tune it to the stories that interest me.\nThe sidebar contains a section titled 'Apple News' and it contains several topics, screenshot below).  I'm not able to customize this section (I can customize sections like 'Following' and 'Suggested by Siri').  I have zero interest in the topic named 'Racial Justice' and want to remove it.\nI went thru Preferences and can't find any way to delete that topic.  I know I can right-click on stories and block channels as well as 'suggest less like this', but that doesn't impact this section of the sidebar.  Does anyone know of a way or a hack to remove items from this section of the sidebar?\n\n\nA: Apple's News editorial team chooses the categories under ‘Apple News’ and these are shown to everyone in your region. These are not customisable per person.\nThe categories you choose to be interested in go under ‘Following’, which is customisable and can be removed with a secondary click and choosing Unfollow Topic or Block Topic.\n", "Q: What is this process called? Apple Time Machine software seems to backup in increments.\nSo you do your first full TM backup and then after that the initial backup seems to be \"built upon\" with new data.\nBut, in data storage terms what is this called? Is it incremental backup?\nAnd secondly, when doing a restore from TM. These \"chunks\" have to knitted together again. What is this process called?\nFrom a user perspective Time Machine seems easy, but I think behinds the scenes its a lot more convoluted than people think. Can anybody shed some light on what goes on with Time Machine behind the scenes?\n\nA: Yes, you can call this a form of incremental backup.\nAnd no, contrary to an \"traditional\" incremental backup, there's no need to \"knit together\" chunks when restoring. So there's no process that needs to be named here. This is similar to what some vendors name \"reverse incremental backups\".\nAn traditional incremental backup system works by first taking a full backup, and then for the following backups storing the changed parts separately - requiring a recombination step when restoring.\nTime Machine instead uses a system where you can always directly read out the total backup in its latest form. In rought terms this is done by having a folder for each backup, and in this folder you have every file as it was when this backup was taken. However most of the files share their data contents with files in older backup folders on the drive (via hard links). Some vendors call this a \"synthetic full backup\".\n", "Q: Change Mac terminal name after the @ symbol I just bought the new Mac mini, this is my first owned Mac.

I have a build system with a command line driven batch file that uses jar (from Java JDK) on a Windows machine to make a zip file like this ...\njar cf c:\\target\\Application-1.5.zip -C Application-1.5/ .\n\nIt \"zips\" up everything in the Application-1.5 directory into zip file Application-1.5.zip.\nI used jar because there's no zip command at the command line on Windows.\nWhen I download the zip file on a Windows 10 machine, Windows extracts the zip fine.\nHowever, when I download the zip file on my MacBook (Catalina), and double-click on the zip file, the Mac won't unzip the file ... it says ... \"Unable to expand \"Application-1.5.zip\".  It is an unsupported format.\nAlso ... when I use the jar command on the Mac to unzip it like this jar -xf ./Application-1.5.zip it works, so the file is \"valid\" but Mac's built-in unzipper doesn't like it.\nWhat do I do to make a zip file that Mac will like?\n\nA: I worked around my problem by installing 7-zip on Windows 10 and using that instead of jar like so ...\n7z a c:\\target\\Application-1.5.zip .\\Application-1.5\\* -r \n\nMac likes the zip file produced by 7-zip, so this will work for me.\nBut I'd still like to know how to make a zip file with jar that Mac's default unarchive can unzip.\n\nA: Thanks for posting this interesting question.\nLooking under the hood of Archive Utility, it turns out that it does two things to check the file type:\n\n*\n\n*Check the file extension: .zip in your case.\n\n*Check the file magic using /usr/bin/file.\n\nIn order to detect the file as a valid zip file, the file magic result must say \"Zip archive data\". I'm guessing that the Archive Utility developers didn't want to rely on the file extension to determine whether something is a zip, so they rely on the file output.\nYou can find out the file output that was produced by setting the following defaults key:\n$ defaults write com.apple.archiveutility log-commands -bool TRUE\n\nand opening the file in Archive Utility. Then the output will show in the system log (Console.app).\n\n(You could also run file asdf.zip yourself to find out the magic.)\nYou can see that file detected the zip as a JAR file, not a Zip file. This is sort of a \"feature\" of the JAR format, which is a Zip but may have a special 0xcafe tag. This tag seems to be a bit of a rabbit hole, but suffice it to say, the jar utility does add it to files it generates.\nNote: I'm running High Sierra. YMMV with other versions.\nAnother way to generate Zip files on Windows is to use Powershell's Compress-Archive. Other readers may want to check into that since it doesn't require installing any software.\n", "Q: BigSur upgrade breaks the share menu option in Safari I've just upgraded to Mac OS X Big Sur (Version 11.01) from Catalina.

Upon clicking the volume icon in the menu bar, if you misclick/misdrag anywhere but the allowable volume change slider it will interpret this as trying to rearrange the menu bar icon to another menu bar location.\nMy current \"fix\" is to use the open the control center menu and drag the volume back into the menu bar every time this happens.\nEDIT: Seems to be fixed in MacOS 11.3\n\nA: I had this problem until I made the change that Aveij described and the icon has not had this problem since.\nNo idea why they made a change that makes a control that I use many times a day disappear.\n", "Q: How do I add an ePub to my iPad I have an ePub which I bought outside of the Book Store, and on which there is no DRM. It is sitting on my iMac, running MacOS Big Sur.\nI can double click on the ePub and open it in the Books App. From there I can add it to one of my collections. The question is how do I add it to my iPad from there?\nAs of Catalina, you’re supposed to do this sort of thing in the Finder. Indeed I can see my iPad, and select the Books tab. However, the list of books only shows a few dozen books, when my iPad definitely has hundreds. The list of books doesn’t show my new books, certainly not my collections. Thus there is no check box for me to select and then sync.\nWhat do I do now?\n\nA: Just send the book via AirDrop to your iPad, then click share and after that select the Books app.\n\nA: I have folder named 'books' under Documents on my Mac for books sourced outside Apple ecosystem.\nVia iCloud this folder is available under Files app in iOS. So in iOS I navigate to 'book' folder in Files app and open book I want. From now on I can access it in Books.\nQuite surprisingly some sort of syncing is present. If I keep book open in Mac Books app then in iOS it opens on the same spot.

When I compose an email in the stock Mail app, it shows potential words via autocomplete.\ne.g. typing  larg results in 'large' popping up as a suggestion.\nHowever, when I hit ENTER to select the word, it adds a carriage return/new line.\nHow can I turn this 'additional newline' behaviour off?\n\nA: Use SPACE to accept autocorrect suggestion.\nIf you like to use enter, then you can open dropdown list of suggested words with ⌥ + ESC, navigate to needed word using arrow keys and press Enter (will take cursor at the end of word).\nWord you are looking for may or may not be first in list and automatically selected. If this happens to be true then of course no navigation with arrow keys is needed and enter can be pressed right away (⌥+ESC and Enter).\nIf you use SPACE instead of Enter then space is added between cursor and end of entered word so you can continue writing right away.\n", "Q: Macbook screen freezes when I move my external mouse I recently updated to macOS Big Sur, and I wanted to use my external mouse for work and gaming.

If you don't need it, get rid of it.\nMore Complex\n\nAfter years of moving the same home directory from one version of macOS to the next...\n\nThis where the problem stems from - simply copying the home folder from one Mac to the next or even between upgrades means that all of the support files, including from programs you no longer use or even have, are taking up space.\nThis is why I don't suggest copying over the entire home folder, but rather only the user data like your documents, pictures, etc. from the home folder when migrating to a new computer (or even when upgrading).  I personally always like to start with a clean slate so-to-speak and I spend some time migrating only what is necessary.\nSome Tips...\nTechnically speaking, you could delete all of it and most will get recreated with only the latest data as you use the Apps.  That, however, will cause you to lose preferences.   This is why I like to backup all of my preference files before embarking on an upgrade or migration.\n\n*\n\n*Backup Your Preferences for Your Important Apps. Using Firefox as an example, find out where the preference files are located and back those up individually.  Then, when you move to your new system, simply copy them back to the default location.\n\n\n*Selectively Migrate. Also, don't migrate everything all at once.  Instead, keep your original Time Machine backup for about 1 month or so after you've created your new account on you new machine and as you install or use programs for the first time, copy the settings from the Time Machine backup as you need them.  This way, you're only migrating what you actually use, not migrating files from the App you stopped using years ago.\n\n\n*Make use of the cloud for data.  I prefer OneDrive over iCloud for syncing my data (mostly because it's cross platform compatibility), but more importantly, it has it's own folder within my $HOME directory, not a folder buried deep within $HOME/Library/Application Support.  I symlink Documents, Pictures, etc. to the OneDrive directory so from a Finder perspective everything looks standard, but everything I have is actually synced to the cloud.  If I move to a new machine, once I sync OneDrive, everything (current) is pulled down from the cloud; no migration necessary.\n\n\n*Keep separate copies of shell customization, scripts, ssh keys, etc. on a different volume.  Over the years, I'm sure you have made a number of tweaks to your shell profile including environment variables, your prompt or even custom functions. Keep these seperate so that when you migrate/move you can easily copy them over.   You can use a (removable) flash disk or a network share, or even a folder in the cloud.  (backed up, of course).  Doing it this way also makes it very easy to share with others or use it on another platform (I do this a lot with my FreeBSD boxes).\n\n\n*Pictures, Music, etc. These files will take up tons of space.  What I do here is get a USB disk (I'm using flash now because it's so inexpensive) to individually back up those files.  Instead of including it on my regular Time Machine backup, I have a separate job for backing up Pictures and Music onto physical media.  Technically, I personally backup to a NAS that backs up to the flash disks, but a NAS isn't required.  A simple USB hub (USB3 and powered is ideal) with some flash sticks that you don't remove makes an excellent backup location.\nThese strategies have worked well for me over the years.  However, in your pradicament, I would suggest to just \"bite the bullet\" and start with a clean user profile and manually migrate as you need it. It will take some time, but you don't need to do it all at once - do it as needed.  Then. when you get ready for your next upgrade/migration, it will be much easier and much faster.\n", "Q: Date and Time only partially visible in Big Sur \nAs you can see in the image above, the date and time are dimmer than normal.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Date and time is now also Notification Center 'icon'. If it is dimmed it means that you have 'Do Not Disturb' active. To toggle between on/off DND hold ⌥ key while clicking on date/time.\nIf you don't like dimming then you should head to Dock & Menu Bar in Preferences.

I've got a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) running Catalina 10.15.3 (cant upgrade OS since its a work laptop) and 3 external monitors. All 3 external monitors are connected and working fine.\nAll external monitors are connect via a HyperDrive GEN2 USB-C Hub 18-in-1. In particular the HyperDrive has 2 HDMI ports and 1 VGA port (all of which I am using). The HyperDrive is connected to my Mac via a USB-C port.\nMy MacBook has 4 x USB-C ports and seemingly no other ports.\nI want to extend the display to all 3 monitors (like I can on Windows).\nWhen I choose to extend the displays via ... System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement tab\nand then uncheck \"Mirror Displays\" ... It extends the display on the laptop monitor to the 3 external monitors, however, the display on the 3 external monitors duplicates/mirrors the display on the other external monitors (but not the laptop monitor).\nI don't want any of the displays to be duplicated! Is this possible on Mac out the box or is there any software to support this?\nI read here ... https://hypershop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044788432-Does-the-12-or-18-port-allow-me-to-display-multiple-monitors- ... that:\n\nMac OS only supports Single Stream Transport (SST) meaning it can only support one extended display over a single USB-C connection.

Any thoughts or help on this?\n\nA: It turns out my MBP ports were TB3 ports not USB-C ports.\nHerein Type C refers to a cable that supports USB-C and TB3.\nI solved this by simply buying cables as follows:\nExternal Monitor 1 ... Type C (MBP TB3 port) ---> HDMI Cable (Monitor)\nExternal Monitor 2 ... Type C (MBP TB3 port) ---> HDMI Cable (Monitor)\nTHEN\nCable from MBP TB3 port ---> HyperDrive (Cable came with HyperDrive)\nTHEN\nExternal Monitor 3 ... VGA (HyperDrive VGA port) ---> VGA Cable (Monitor)\nAND\nVoila - Monitor extends to all 4 displays (including laptop display).\nTHE GENERAL RULE IS, USE 1 TB3 PORT PER MONITOR IF YOU WANT TO EXTEND YOUR DISPLAY TO THAT MONITOR.\nAnd I have 1 TB3 port left for the power. Perfect!\nThe only reason you need a HyperDrive at all is so that you have some ports for USB-A / USB-B devices, etc.\nGenerally speaking, you can purchases cables from any port type to any port type. I think they even do Type C to VGA if you need it!\nI purchased my cables from Amazon Prime and they arrived next day. Companies I purchased cables from were UGreen and Uni. All cables purchased worked great. God is good! Jesus is amazing!\n\nA: No, second screens are addressed as separate windows and not spanned. You can run 6 plus displays on the macOS window manager even without external GPU, so it’s not about ports or cables or protocols. It’s the window manager design you’re fighting.\nIf you consider adding more pixels on a second or third display, then it’s trivial to add displays, just connect them. If you want a blended space where two displays extend into one logical contiguous space, that needs hardware or a different OS.  This came about in Mavericks and there’s no sign Apple is reversing decision on this.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.imore.com/how-span-window-between-two-displays-mavericks\nThe best you can do is in mission control, enable displays have their own spaces.\n\n*\n\n*how to make each display a separate space, yet have a keyboard shortcut to move both screens at the same time?\nYou also might be very happy with an external GPU since it simplifies cable management and unlocks performance far past the MacBook Pro / Intel chipset alone can deliver.\n", "Q: Which phone number is shared by Apple Pay in a dual SIM iPhone?

If it's not possible, could you point me to an editor that supports line numbers that I could use with HDL files?\n\n\nA: I typically use the App Store app to download BBEdit since it runs for free and has all the things you would want including line numbers. If you are familiar with VSCode, that’s a solid option too, but it is not a native app like BBEdit and TextEdit are.\nI’m fairly sure there is no line number function in TextEdit.\n\n*\n\n*http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html\n\n*https://code.visualstudio.com/\n\nA: Emacs.

For interactive use it's probably best to call python2 directly if you rely on pre-3 syntax/functionality.\nPS: AFAIK it's the same for zsh.\n", "Q: Can I connect a mid-2011 iMac to an external HDMI display with a mini Displayport-to-HDMI cable? I have a mid-2011 iMac running Sierra.  I just purchased a new Ultrawide monitor to use primarily on my PC, but it also supports dual input devices, so I was thinking I could connect my iMac to it in order to have the Mac as a picture-in-picture on the same screen as the PC.\nThe iMac has mini Displayport and Thunderbolt.  The new monitor has HDMI inputs.  I would like to use the miniDP port.  Will a miniDP-to-HDMI adapter/cable work?  I seem to recall the 2011 iMac was right on the cusp of some changes to DP and the only way I've ever connected an external display to this iMac was using the Apple mini DP to Dual-Link DVI cable/adapter.  Can I just go direct miniDP-to-HDMI?\n\nA: Yes, a mini-DisplayPort to HDMI cable will work well with the iMac.\n\nA: \nCan I just go direct miniDP-to-HDMI?\n\nYes, but I wouldn't advise it as your first option.\nThe DisplayPort and HDMI signals are very different. It's not just the pin-out of the adapters that are different, there's a difference in voltages and a clock sync signal that's doesn't exist in DisplayPort.  Because of this, you can run into issues.  Here's a short sampling:\n\n*\n\n*Screen blinking \"HDMI no signal\" when Mac is sleeping\n\n*External Monitors Flicker when plugged into my Mac\n\n*HDMI to DisplayPort Not Working\n\n*MacBook Pro detects syncmaster (monitor) but doesn't display\nTherefore, to avoid/overcome these potential issues, I suggest (in order), the following:\n\n*\n\n*Use native DisplayPort input and avoid HDMI\n\n*Using an Active HDMI Adapter rather than using a passive cable/adapter\n\nUnlike a passive adapter/cable, the active adapter will recreate the actual HDMI signal giving you a more reliable connection.\nI personally avoid HDMI for all my computer related activities.  I've found that by using the native DP connectivity end-to-end and not converting, my displays/video have been rock solid with no issues. Less conversion = higher reliability.\n", "Q: How to stop announcing the time on macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 After upgrading to Big Sur, my Mac started announcing the time every hour.\nI didn't find a way to disable announcing the time, do I maybe have to run a Terminal command?\n\nA: You can disable this in System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar -> Clock\n\nThe setting is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist:\n$ plutil -p com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist\n{\n  \"SpokenUIUseSpeakingHotKeyFlag\" => 1\n  \"TimeAnnouncementPrefs\" => {\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsEnabled\" => 1\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsIntervalIdentifier\" => \"EveryHourInterval\"\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier\" => \"ShortTime\"\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsVoiceSettings\" => {\n      \"CustomVolume\" => 0.5\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou can use any Plist editor (or defaults) to change the setting, it may require a restart (or killing the Dock) though to get activated.\n", "Q: Remove Chrome Policy.

I have an iPhone SE (1st generation) in which Sprint was the previous carrier.  I'm trying to figure out what other carriers may be compatible with this phone.  I found this web site -- https://www.whistleout.com/CellPhones/Guides/Will-my-iPhone-SE-work-on-another-carrier, that says there is T-Mobile 4G compatibility but \"Missing bands: 66, 71\".\nWhat does this mean?  Does this mean if someone uses this phone with a T-Mobile 4G network that there may be intermittent call drops or network outages because of the missing bands?\n\nA: Carrier bands are analogous to TV or radio station \"channels.\"  Each carrier operates a specified network technology and are assigned bands in which they can operate.  In order for your phone to connect to a carrier's network, your phone must be able to connect to at least one of the carrier's bands.  The more bands, the more ways to connect to the carrier network.\nDepending on how many of that carrier's bands you can connect to determines the quality and availability of the service.  It doesn't necessarily mean that you'll have poor connections with the carrier, but rather you may not get signal in a particular market.  Whether or not you get dropped calls or poor service has more to do with the capacity, saturation, and signal strength than the number of different bands.\nFor example, you might be able to get excellent coverage in the city, but if you go to the outskirts of the suburbs or into a rural area, you may lose coverage.  They may be using band 66 (this is an arbitrary example and not necessarily the actual case) out in the farmland or countryside.  Since your phone doesn't support band 66, you won't be able to use this band to access the network.\n", "Q: SD card not detected through a USB hub on a newer intel-based Mac This is my first time trying out an SD card via a USB hub on my new Mac (since there's no port for SD card on newer Macs) and I can't seem to detect the SD card; it doesn't show in disk utility and nor in finder.Does anyone know what could potentially be the cause?\nThis is my setup\n\nA: You won't see it in disk utils or finder until it is mounted. The primary causes of this are (in my experience):\n\n*\n\n*Inadequate power in the USB-C hub. Typically, power needs to pass through the hub rather than the hub being a stub. (Sorry, couldn't resist the rhyme). I think I saw the hub plugged in by itself...\nNow, that said, with nothing else, that shouldn't be a problem, but try it. It's quite common with USB hard drives that are USB powered.\n\n\n*Bad connection or damaged card. Check the card contacts, make sure they are clean and undamaged.\n\n\n*A corrupted card (or a card image that looks corrupted due to 1 or 2). Check to see if an fsck process is running on the card; this is done for 'dirty' disk images that aren't known to be cleanly ejected. It won't mount until that completes. If the process is hung, or dies repeatedly, then it's likely that it's having a hard time reading the card, again, see 1 and 2. If it's hung, kill it, and eject the card and try again.\n", "Q: Are Apple silicon M1 Chip MacBook Air/Pro \"laptops\" usable on the lap? I have a work-issued MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) running macOS Catalina, and it's not usable as a laptop, because it runs too hot, making it impossible to hold on the lap for any significant amount of time.\nThere's nothing in System Preferences to address the problem; I know it has very powerful fans, but they are generally turned very low and are inaudible, and there doesn't appear to be any free software that would automatically control said fans to attain a desired thermal profile (e.g., maybe 35degC or lower) to make it usable as a laptop on a lap.  This is confirmed by third-party reviews as well, as Notebook Check shows that it can run as hot as 42 degC on surface, when the ambient temperature is merely 19 degC, which possibly means mine's running at maybe 45 degC at 23 degC ambient, which is surely not comfortable.\nIt is my understanding that the new Apple silicon M1 Chip are supposed to be much more energy efficient than the older processors; however, it's also the case that MacBook Air no longer has a fan in the newest iteration.\nAre the new M1-based MacBooks finally usable as actual laptops, to keep on the lap for an extended period of time?  (Or is there any free software for MBP 16\" to reign in the thermal envelope?)  And why doesn't Apple offer any \"laptop mode\" options for its laptops, to automatically spin up the fans if the temps get uncomfortable for keeping on the lap?  Windows has software like SpeedFan that does that easily.\n\nA: The M1 machines are much more portable since the Processors fit within a 10 Watt thermal envelope. Intel CPU fit in about the same thermal design power (TDP) envelope, but measures and battery life show the M1 run far cooler in the same metal case.\n\nApple always avoids calling them laptop computers, but the Apple Silicon M1 is designed to be far more efficient which makes them cooler, use less battery and do more work for the fixed battery power available.\n\nA: According to iPhone in Canada, they did a temperature check of the new M1 MBA and MBP and found them to be cooler than previous models (forgive the extended quote but I wanted to get all the info into the answer).\n\nWe ran a Cinebench benchmark (runs 10 minutes straight,\nsimulating an export operation) on both the MacBook Air and MacBook\nPro\nUsing a thermal imaging camera, Heads of Technology shared the heat\ndistribution on the bottom of each laptop. The following temperatures\nwere taken after a short cooling period (5 minutes or so from their\nvideo) after Cinebench had completed.\nYou can see the M1 MacBook Air has a temperature of 37.4C (99.3F), with heat\nconcentrated in the upper middle back area, favouring the upper left,\nlooking at the laptop from the bottom:\n\nThe M1 MacBook Pro had a slightly lower temperature of 36C (96.8F), with heat\nconcentrated along the centre and slightly more towards the upper\nright compared to the left. The MacBook Pro has a fan to dissipate\nheat, while the MacBook Air does not:\n\nThese temperatures are really low compared to non-M1 2020 MacBook Air\nunits, which many customers have been complaining about overheating\nearlier this year, with temps up to 80C and fans spinning at 2-3000\nRPM. Now, you have a fan-less M1 MacBook Air that can much, much\ncooler, similar to the temperature of the human body.\n\nWhile this is not an exact scientific measurement, it should give you an idea of how much cooler these run.  Hopefully, someone who owns one can put it on their laptop for a while, do some work, and come back to add their experience.\n\nA: Yes, the M1s use radically less power, as mentioned before.\nI'm surprised, however, that (for example) Macs Fan Control or iStat Menus can't bring the fans up and the temperature down on your 16? What happens?\n", "Q: Mail on Big Sur does not reliably find dollar values As an online shopper, I regularly use Amazon to purchase lots of stuff.  When I reconcile my credit card spending, I use Mail.app to search all mailboxes for specific dollar figures (e.g. command-option F, then type 24.95).\nPrior to Big Sur, finding dollar figures in Mail.app worked perfectly, whether the email messages resided \"On My Mac\" or on iCloud.  However, since Big Sur, doing a global Mail.app search for numeric strings, especially with a decimal point, doesn't work reliably.\nFor example, I'll do a global search in Mail.app for 65.88 and I'll get one result from a locally archived message from years ago, however a very recent message in my InBox containing that figure is not found.  When I do a single message search (command-F) looking for 65.88, the value IS found.\nUnsurprisingly, using Spotlight delivers the exact same results.\nUsing mdutil, I've manually erased and rebuilt the Spotlight index, rebuilt my Mail.app mailboxes, deleted all ~/Library/Mail/V8/MailData/Envelope* files to force the Mail.app to re-import everything, and reinstalled Big Sur.  I've also confirmed all my Spotlight settings to assure that Mail and Messages are included in searches, and that the volume where my mail resides is not excluded.  Nothing worked.\nI should note that I am using one SSD for macOS, and a separate SSD for my Home directory (c/o \"Advanced Options\" under Users & Groups).  I've had this setup well before Big Sur, again, without any issues.\nInterestingly, I tried using the Spark email app, which DID successfully find dollar figures without any issue.  I suspect that Spark is not relying on Spotlight to obtain search results, and that's why it works.  (I would use Spark, however it doesn't support local mailboxes.)\nI've already sent Apple a report using the Feedback Assistant, and I can only hope something will get fixed.\nCan anyone else confirm this issue with Mail.app on Big Sur?  Any ideas on what else I can do?\n\nA: I can confirm this is a real issue since Big Sur. I did talk with Apple Tech Support, she agreed it is a known issue. She told me to put problem in Feedback Assistance which I did a while back. I have not come up with any work around other then just searching for numbers to left of the decimal point as you mentioned.\nIn addition, various text and text strings are not found as well. Really want Apple to fix this asap.\n\nA: \"doing a global Mail.app search for numeric strings, especially with a decimal point, doesn't work reliably\" -- this works with a decimal coma\n", "Q: Why sometimes the charger for iPad Pro cannot charge for Macbook Pro Why sometimes the charger for iPad Pro cannot charge for Macbook Pro.\nI use the charger for iPad Pro to charge Macbook Pro, sometimes it can be used to charge the Macbook Pro while sometimes it cannot work.\n\n\n\nA: The chargers have different capacities.\nSo the ipad charger can charge the pro when it is idle but cannot meet the demand when the pro is working hard.\n", "Q: kernelmanagerd using 50% of the cpu constantly After upgrading to macOS Big Sur my MacBook Pro 2017 constantly heats up even when it not in use which was not the case before upgrading.

However, it still taking space in my SSD, because I can see it in Storage Management.\nCould you help me to copy to an external device and delete from my computer the Documents folder? Thanks\n\nA: In Big Sur the real location of an iCloud Documents folder is within ~/Library/Mobile Documents. There you will also find folders for various apps that maintain their own iCloud folders. No matter where you view them from, various icons should appear by files (to the right in list & columns views) to indicate their iCloud status.

Here's a screenshot from it...\n\n\nA: The contents of the iCloud Documents folder is completely eligible to move to an external drive. Select the files you wish to move and drag them to the external drive. You can delete them from iCloud after you've verified the copy was successful.\nIf you receive an error when copying these files, please post it here.

It is the same with photos you take while your phone is locked, and then delete them, while it is still locked, they still show up in your gallery, although they are already in the bin folder.

I have an iMac with a full-size keyboard as shown below. I'm curious if there is some webpage that explains what each key actually does (apart from the obvious querty keys, etc.)\nHowever, I'm particularly confused by the two sets of up/down keys beside the fn key.\nThe key with arrow pointing downward toward a horizontal line is driving me crazy. Say I'm editing a document and I press this key, it scroll down a page (but doesn't move the cursor). If I press the key again, it scrolls back up a page, and moves the cursor to the end of the line.\nIs this what's supposed to happen? Ideally I want this key to behave like a traditional 'end' key.\n\n\nA: It was formerly labeled \"end\" and should function exactly as you described.\nIts function is app-specific. While it's up to the developer to interpret its meaning and implement it in code, exactly what it's supposed to do is not strictly defined anywhere. You can peruse Apple's Human Interface Guidelines but it won't tell you exactly what to do with that particular key, but that document's general principles state user input should always do something the user expects.\nLacking specific guidance it's reasonable to look to the examples Apple provides in their own apps. Using Safari as an example (because I happen to be using it right now) that particular key will scroll to the end of the webpage, no matter how long it might be. In other words, exactly as you expect and not as you experienced in the example you provided. Pressing it again should do nothing assuming the displayed webpage is still at its end. That suggests the app in question is not following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.\nWhat can you determine from Apple's Human Interface Guidelines? Whereas it does not define that particular key, it provide suggested actions for Down Arrow, Control-Down Arrow, etc. By trial and error I determined that ⌘ Down Arrow performs the same function as the End key—the one you're asking about. I suppose that's relevant if the user doesn't have a full size keyboard as in your picture.\nFinally, even Apple occasionally fails to observe their own Human Interface Guidelines. Calling their attention to that fact in a bug report might get them to address such an oversight... eventually.\n", "Q: When a powered USB hub is used, would we need to worry the power flowing from the hub back into the MacBook or iMac? If I use a non-powered USB hub, the iPad Air or iPad Pro could be losing power over a few hours, because the charging power is not enough.\nHowever, if I get a powered USB hub, would it be an issue, say, if the USB port on the MacBook, MacBook Air, iMac is at 5.2V, while the powered USB hub happens to be 5.3V, in which case the current could be going back into the Mac instead of out of it?\nThis may be more of an issue if the iPad Air and iPad Pro is unplugged, so the current has no where else to go.\n\nA: There's an isolation on the power connectors to prevent power from the hub flowing into the USB-A port on a computer.

If it shows up there but not in the System Preferences, I would hazard a guess that it's a driver issue. If it doesn't show up there, then I would think it's a hardware issue. Maybe also check the system logs for coreaudiod; the USB audio interface I use shows up within a second of being plugged in and prints all kind of info there.\nIn general, I've never had issues with USB audio devices on macOS over the last 15 years, and this reddit thread indicates that there are others with a similar issue with AKG headphones.

The only way I can get a bookmark for the page listed at 666 is to find the pdf-page 666 and create the bookmark there (which is page 629 in the book-listing).\nI never encountered this strange behaviour on my MacBook Air 2013, but I recently upgraded to the Macbook Air 2020. Has anyone else experienced the same issue and if so, how did you fix this?\nI'm using Preview version 11.0 (999.4)\nI'm running macOS 10.15.7\n\nA: Apple did change the way that Preview handles logical vs absolute page numbers at some point, and it's not entirely good.\nPreview shows logical page numbers only in thumbnail view\nIt's also worth pointing out that Preview's Bookmarks are entirely proprietary: they only work in Preview (and possibly other Apple apps), and are outside of the PDF standard (which has its own perfectly good mechanism for bookmarks).\n\"Other PDF viewers are available.\"\n\nA: I was having this problem after updating to Big Sur and tried turning off logical page numbers by going to Preferences > PDF and then unticking the Viewing documents: use logical page numbers box.

I want a seamless way to launch a particular app at any moment on iOS, whether the device is locked, on the home screen or in a particular app.\nIs there any way to create any kind of shortcut or functionality to do so?\nOf course, simply going to the home screen and then clicking on the app is possible, but my desire is to give the ability to launch the app even more directly, without any intermediate steps.\nI may be able to make an Apple Shortcut that launches the app, but it would only be accessible if there were a Share menu in the app I was in.\nI think I could make a Siri shortcut, but it would have to be voice activated, and that’s not ideal for all situations.\nSo: is there any hack or possibility I haven’t thought about for quickly launching a specific app, from anywhere?\nRight now, the only idea I have is being able to associate launching a Shortcut with a particular hardware functionality like tapping the back of the phone, clicking the power button and volume button at the same time, and so on.\n\nA: Besides the hardware functionality you mention in the last paragraph of your question, I think the only other solution is to use the NFC support in Shortcuts like this:\nOpen up the Shortcuts app and tap the Automatics tab in the bottom of the screen. Tap the \"Create Personal Automation\" button and then choose \"NFC\". Tap the \"Scan\" button and hold the NFC tag on to the phone. Then tap \"Next\" and \"Add Action\" and choose the app functionality to launch.\nNow you can use the tag to trigger the launch at any moment.\nNOTE: You need an iPhone XS or later that supports background tag reading.\n\nA: There is \"Back Tap\" accessibility feature in iOS 14 which can be used.

When I start it again, then I'm unable to scroll up, on my external Logitech Mouse.

So I'm pretty certain, that it's a software-issue.\nHowever once, I got it working by simply reboot.\nAnd another time I tried that the clearing of the PRAM didn't solve it. But then I did it again, which then solved it. Really wierd!\nHere are some facts:\n\n*\n\n*It has happened about 20+ times so far, and it's always scroll-up that won't work.\n\n*It's not every time it crashes, but I'd say 80% of the times. My gut feeling tells me that it has something to do with, if I have been scrolling, when it crashes.\n\n*I have tried several different mice-models, and this is the only model it has happened with. But I don't want to switch mouse-model, since this is the best mouse across all other areas.\n\n*The built-in touch mouse works as it should. It's only my external mouse (the scroll-up feature) that doesn't work.\n\n*I've tried reconnecting the USB-cable. And the USB-cable is connected to an adapter, and I've tried reconnecting that as well.\n\n\nI'm looking for a way where I can 'clear the driver cache' for the mouse?

But once everything had started up, scroll up stopped working. So it is some software bug.\nI tried plugging in my Magic Mouse 2, and on that the scroll did work!\nI'm not a fan of that mouse, so I went and bough a new mouse that was bluetooth (MX Anywhere 3).

But only once! Second time I did it, no luck. I tried several times, but it was only that first time that I got it working. And that was on the MX Anywhere 2 mouse.\nI've also purchased an MX Anywhere 3 mouse - and I don't recall having gotten the bug on that, but I'm not sure.\nThis is driving me mental.\n\nUpdate 4 - 2021-05-09\nI just experienced something wierd.

I am sending it to you. Could you please take a look and tell whether you think my mac got infected or not?\nI installed Clear VPN through my Setapp subscription last week and it asked for my keychain password. I am not really informed on keychain access and security. I was even less informed last week. I reset the password for keychain and entered it in the Clear VPN App and then got this suspicious alert on MacOS Kernel. I then tried to restore from a time machine backup, which seemed to help (this was a couple of days earlier). But today I got this alert once again. I blocked it. However, I have a feeling that this is not good.\nMaybe the installation of clear VPN and keychain password isn't related to this alert. I don't know. If anyone does, could you please help me with this and shed some light on the matter?\nBig Sur 11.0.1\nLittle Snitch 5.0.3\n\n\nA: There's nothing there that indicates being \"hacked.\"\nToo often, folks see connections or random behavior and immediately assume this is a hacking attempt.  It's not.\nThis could be any number of legitimate connection attempts especially given that the IP in question isn't flagged as coming from a known hacking IP, one of the many rogue countries (like China) or from a remote, anonymous proxy.\nNow, you shouldn't be getting connections like this directly to the kernel especially if you are behind a firewall.  However, if your Mac sends a request out and creates a \"state\" on your firewall, it can connect back - making this entirely legitimate.\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you're behind a proper firewall\n\n*Turn on the firewall on the Mac\n\n*Log outgoing connections in Little Snitch to correlate traffic\n\nBottom line...a single connection is not enough to determine anything.  You need to see this in context and you need to see the actual traffic that's incoming.  If you're not using firewalls, your very first action is to get behind one and/or turn it on.\n\nA: I believe this is a real hack attempt targeting a BitTorrent listener on port 6881. I witnessed such an attempt recently from a malicious source IP, identified as a VPN client located in Zurich. Most likely, your firewall has port forwarding enabled on port 6881 to the machine running Little Snitch, prompting the alert. Whether or not a torrent service is running on the Mac, you'd see the alert from Little Snitch when the connection is attempted.\nTo check if your Mac is actually listening on port 6881 and see the application and PID responsible for it, run a command in the terminal (netstat on Mac will not show the process name and PID, a limitation of netstat on the mac, so we use this instead):\nlsof -i -P | grep -i listen\n\nIf Little Snitch hadn't stopped the attempt, it's reasonable to assume the connection would be dropped, since there is nothing listening on port 6881... unless there is something listening on port 6881 in your case, such as when running a torrent client.\nYou can disable port 6881 at the firewall when you don't need it, or better yet use a different port as a listener, so that you are less likely to be targeted. Hopefully modern Macs block connections to the kernel without the use of Little Snitch. It would be a major vulnerability if it were allowed by the operating system. I had a difficult time finding information online describing such an attack or what operating systems would be vulnerable.\n", "Q: How can I disconnect my profile from a dead OSX Server?

I have a TrueNAS server with two afp shares and an smb share on it.  In the keychain of my mac system I can see the saved credentials for one of the afp shares, and for the smb share.  But I can't see any saved credentials for the second afp share.\nHowever from Finder when I do a \"Go => Connect to Server\" and enter the details of the second afp share, my mac connects to this share without asking me for that share's credentials.  But this share does have credentials on the server side so I believe that the credentials for it are being cached somewhere on my mac.\nSo if the credentials are not being cached in my keychain, where else could they be cached?\nThe reason I ask is that I believe that the cached credentials for this second afp share are wrong and I want to try and reset them.\nEdit\nI just changed the password on the server side and now I cannot connect to that second afp share.  OS X reports \"There was a problem connecting to the server\", but doesn't prompt me for any new credentials.  This says to me that the credentials are being cached somewhere.\n\nA: Things are way weirder than I thought!  The way that I access my three shares is:\n\n*\n\n*afp://192.168.1.100/Share1\n\n*afp://192.168.1.100/Share2\n\n*smb://192.168.1.100/share3\n\nWith all the entries deleted from the keychain and I do a \"Connect to server\", I am prompted for the server side credentials.  If I enter them and do not check \"Remember this password in my keychain\", then all is well and I can correctly log into any of the shares.\nThe issue seems to be when I do check \"Remember this password in my keychain\".  From experimenting, the keychain only remembers the credentials per IP address and per protocol.  So that there was always only ever 2 different entries in my keychain: one for afp://192.168.1.100 and one for smb://192.168.1.100 and that the keychain would ignore the share name itself for a single protocol/IP pair when retrieving the server credentials.\nSo the sequence of events seems to be:\n\n*\n\n*(no credentials in keychain)\n\n*Access afp Share1\n\n*Prompted for credentials for Share1\n\n*Check \"Remember..\" and the correct credentials are saved for share1 in my keychain.\n\n*Access afp Share2\n\n*The keychain gets excited and says \"Hey I've got credentials for that IP address and that protocol - here they are!!!!!\" and totally ignores the share name itself.\n\n*Somehow the system then connects to afp Share2, but with the wrong password.\n\n*With the wrong credentials applied, I end up with a read only access to the share.\n\nI only noticed this because previously I hadn't saved the password for either of the afp shares.  Over the weekend I updated the server and as a part of checking that I could access the shares I finally checked the \"remember .. \" check box.  But I didn't get an error or notice that the second share was read only until today when I was trying to use the system.\nI did check the smb share and this was connecting as read/write.\nNote that I tried to fix things in my Keychain by renaming the afp share entry in order to disambiguate the two afp shares.  However this didn't solve anything.  It seems the keychain only cares about protocol/IP pairs\n", "Q: How do I check the active audio codec for a bluetooth connection in Big Sur? How do I check the active audio codec for a bluetooth connection in Bug Sur?\nIn Catalina, you used to be able to option-click on the Bluetooth item in the menubar, and then it would show more detail about every item including the codecs for audio devices. Now it still shows the additional detail but not the audio codec.\nHow do I see the audio codec being used now -- for instance, to ensure that my headphones are using AAC and not SBC?\n\nA: Download Bluetooth Explorer, open it, then navigate to Tools > Audio Graphs. You can see at the bottom the active codec - in this example I'm using AAC.\n\nNote that Bluetooth Explorer is no longer included in the latest Xcode Additional Tools bundle. The last version I could find was for Xcode 11, and it now crashes sometimes on Big Sur, but still does the trick. Download it here: https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=additional%20tools\n\nA: Pasting a solution I found from a GitHub gist comment.

Over the course of the last two days I have received upwards of ten notifications alerting me that a password reset request was sent from some device. When I go to check my Apple ID email, I see no notifications to this effect. When I click the \"Show\" button, I am taken to System Preferences and given the opportunity to type in my administrator password to reset my Apple ID password. I have not done so.\nThe full message of the notification reads: \"A password reset request was sent from a device at the location shown below.\"\nI have a hard time believing this is a legitimate communication from Apple. The few others who have posted similar questions here and elsewhere have received unhelpful answers. Any idea what's going on here? Has my system been compromised somehow?\n10.15.7 (19H2)\n\n\nA: I suggest changing your iCloud password and enabling 2-factor authentication if you haven't already.  But DO NOT click the notification to do this.  Go to Apple's website to do it.  (Also, don't trust anyone on the internet to give you a good link.  Check your URL bar to make sure you are at appleid.apple.com when you click even my link.)\nAlso, go to System Preferences -> Notifications and see what apps have notification access and restrict notification access to anything that looks suspicious.\nJudging by the way the notification looks, it does not look legitimate as it does not have an app icon.  You can call Apple if you want to make sure, though.\n\nA: I just had the same issue. I changed my Apple ID ( appleid.apple.com) and the notifications have gone away.\nI contacted Apple Support about this. They said they were getting a lot of messages about this today (07.11.22) and shared with me the \"If you think your Apple ID has been compromised\" Apple support webpage.\nFWIW- @Salocor's sage advice was best and spot on.\nBest of luck.\n\nA: These messages can be legitimate. I'm on Big Sur and received the same notification. Shortly after I received a legitimate 2-FA code via SMS and a call with spoken code shortly thereafter. All these actions were not initiated by myself.\nAs a precaution I changed my password and tried went through the \"forgot password\"-steps myself to make sure this could be initiated without having my password. The good news is that these verification requests, texts and calls can be initiated by having only your e-mailaddress and phonenumber. So you can probably rest assured that your password is not compromised. Just to be sure, I'd recommend changing it anyways, as elaborately explained by user Salocor.\n", "Q: Some of the keys on my keyboard are not working Some of the keys on my keyboard are not working all of a sudden.

Hopefully my keyboard isn't just dead :(\nUpdate:\nWithout further input of my own, the problem has apparently resolved itself. The one physical change that may hint towards the underlying problem is that my laptop has cooled significantly since I made this post originally.\n\nA: Probably just dead.  I suggest plugging in an external keyboard to test if it's software or hardware.  If on the external keyboard the same keys don't work, then you know it is a software issue.  Otherwise if the external keyboard works fine, it's a hardware issue.\nYou can also take it to an Apple Store to get it diagnosed, and if it is broken, fixed.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone have too many photos in a smart album after syncing from my Mac? I set up a smart album on my Mac. It only contains the ~500 photos I expect. I selected that smart album to sync onto my iPhone. After the sync completes, that smart album on the iPhone contains approximately all the photos in my collection! Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: I don't believe you can sync photos from a Smart Album to an iPhone or iPad if you're using iCloud Photos on those devices.\nYou need to first turn off iCloud Photos on the iPhone, wait until all your photos are removed from the device, then try to sync the photos in the Smart Album via USB to your Mac.\nIf you turn iCloud Photos on for the iPhone, it will remove the photos from the Smart Album sync and replace them with the iCloud Photos images.  That's the situation I think you're seeing now.  There's no way around this other than to turn off iCloud Photos on the iPhone.\n", "Q: Why is screentime and app usage reporting different numbers? I have screentime set up for managing apps and usage and am having a hard time making sense of the numbers.\nIn this instance I have set all apps to be limited to 2 hours, and you can see that the time used is around that amount (I changed the limit to 30 minutes just before this screenshot because I was experimenting). However, the used time is nearly 5 hours.\nWhy does my screentime report 4:42 and usage continues without hindrance. Changing it down to 30 minutes hinders usage but to allow later usage, I have to allow > 4:42. This is inconsistent with the app usage and makes management difficult. What’s being counted and why does it vary so wildly? \n\nA: If you click the blue \"SHOW CATEGORIES\" button, you'll see the categories listed in the list at the bottom of the screen. You can see what usage is labelled as Social, Education and Creativity - the rest of your usage is shown as the grey bar.\nThis can include for example having the phone displaying the lock screen or the home screen. It does not count as time for any particular app, and thus do not interfere with your app limits - but it is still counted as time the phone is displaying something.\n", "Q: How often should a RAID consistency check be done? I have a LaCie 60TB RAID array. I've had it for a couple of years, but I am wondering how often I should do a \"Consistency Check\" on it. I don't know a whole lot about RAIDs. It's formatted HFS+, so I think this is a different than defragmenting. LaCie don't mention doing this as a routine in the section of the manual regarding the subject.\n\nA: A RAID consistency check will verify all of the blocks in the volume so there will be  a significant hit to operational read/write  performance.  That means you want to run this test ideally during off hours.\nThat said, how often you run it will depend on  its use.   Typically, in an IT department with a typical file server and lots of reads and writes, a consistency check every week is advised.   If this is for archival access - more reads than writes - a less frequent consistency check is fine. On the other side of that coin, if it's a file server with more writes, you'll want to check it more often.\nThe file system type really plays no bearing on it because the consistency is for the RAID array to ensure that it's consistent across the whole volume.\nThat said, of all the arrays I have used in the past, Sun StorEdge with ZFS was champion; hands down.  I’ve since moved onto FreeBSD with ZFS and the ability to ensure redundancy and resiliency is bar none the best I’ve run across.\n\nA: You should balance running the consistency check with your requirements for uptime for the RAID-array. Essentially running the consistency check makes the RAID-volume slower for a long period of time, so you want to avoid doing that when you need the full performance of the volume.\nOn the other hand, not running it often enough could result in errors going undetected for a longer period of time, eventually leading to a situation where you'll fail to be able to read the data even though it is on a RAID (assuming we're talking about RAID-5, RAID-6 or similar with redundancy). Running a consistency check earlier on could have detected the error and corrected it, perhaps kicking in a hot spare or having you eventually replace the drive.\nThis means that not running the consistency check often enough increases the risk of you having to take the whole volume down in order to restore a backup, which is often a quite time consuming task. So it's a balance.\nContrary to popular advice, the interval between consistency checks should not be chosen simply based on how many writes you have on the volumes or hold how the hard drives are. I.e. for example the argument that an archive that it is only written to very seldom and mostly endures reads will need only a less frequency consistency check is actually not a good idea. Similarly thinking that new hard drives require fewer consistency checks is also not a good idea.\nInstead you need to take into account the actual size of the individual drives. The larger the drives, the higher the risk that errors occur undetected on parts of the drive that are not accessed. If you have very large individual drives, you want to run consistency checks very often. It is for this reason that RAID-5 is really not advisable with very large drive sizes.\nNote that if your RAID consists of SSDs things are slightly different.\n", "Q: When mirroring my Macbook Pro with an ultra-wide external display, can the resolution be set to the external's native resolution? To emphasize again, this question is about mirroring. I'm looking at buying a 3440x1440 (or higher) resolution monitor, and I'd like to use it as the only display with my MBP while keeping the MBP open. From my research, it doesn't seem possible to do this. The workaround I found, was to mirror the displays. So, if I do that, will the resolution match the external display?\n\nA: Yes. When mirroring, you can choose which display to \"optimize\" for.\n\n", "Q: Alternative Notification System for Macos || Program or CLI to Display Image/Emblem/Icon at corner of screen (no text or box) I am hoping there is some kind of alternate notification system available for macos as a program or a cli. I don't mind paying. I have created vim bindings with karabiner that work anywhere on macos, but I would like to display a small indicator any time I switch modes or turn the bindings on or off.\nIf you don't know what vim is, basically I just want to display a small colored circle or some similar indicator on the corner of my screen using a bash/zsh/shell scripting command.\nIf anyone could give me some direction on beginning to write an application or system extension I will do that if I can't find a tool for this out there.\n\nA: The premiere notification third party notification system for macOS is Growl:\nhttps://github.com/growl/growl\nThe project was just recently marked as retired (less than a week ago), but you can still download the code and use it. It is very easy to use Growl to trigger a notification from a shell script.\nIf you can live with the built-in macOS notifications, you can use a command like this from your shell script:\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Mode change\" with title \"Mode change\"'\n\nThis uses the built-in AppleScript function for displaying a local notification. You can ofcourse change the text to be whatever you want, like \"Bindings turned on\", and so on.\nIf you want to write your own application to display the notification, you could start looking at this sample application code from Apple:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/FunkyOverlayWindow/Introduction/Intro.html\nIt is basically an overlay window that appears on top of every other window at all times. If you make it small, you could use it to display a color when you want, and let it be fully transparent at other times.\n", "Q: System Preferences keeps coming back to dock after every use following Big Sur update I don't want System Preferences in my dock (not just because of the annoying red badge that keeps showing, I just don't want it).  I move it to trash, but every time I open System Preferences again, it pins it back to the dock.  I have to 'remove from dock' each time.  Why?  How do I prevent this?\n\n\nA: This area of the dock, separated by the lines, is your recent applications. It will show your three most recent applications, even if they're closed.\nIf you only want to hide System Preferences and not disable the feature entirely, you will need to open other applications (at least three) and System Preferences will be replaced.\nAlternatively, you can hide this area of the dock in the Dock preferences. It is a checkbox called \"Show recent applications in Dock.\":\n\n", "Q: How does Rosetta 2 work? I'd love to understand more about how Rosetta 2 works. The Apple Developer article is brief. Has anyone done a deep analysis on how Rosetta 2 works, how it is invoked and whether it's possible to use it via an API?\nSome questions:\n\n*\n\n*How are x86_64 applications launched under Rosetta?\n\n*Is it possible to dynamically invoke translation for a portion of x86 instructions?\n\n*Might it be possible to bridge Rosetta to QEMU or similar to allow fast virtualization of Intel Docker images?\n\n\nA: This is an answer for a deep analysis on how Rosetta 2 works.\nI have reverse-engineered Rosetta 2 a little bit. For more details, see the GitHub pages of this project.\nCache files of Rosetta 2 are located at both /System/Library/dyld/aot_shared_cache and /var/db/oah/.\n/System/Library/dyld/aot_shared_cache contains only translated results for System dylibs (e.g., /usr/lib/system/libsystem_blocks.dylib, /usr/lib/system/libxpc.dylib You can see the full list here for macOS Big Sur version 11.1). This file contains multiple cache files for System dylibs, so its file size is huge.\nFor non-system binaries such as third-party x86_64 binaries, the files with aot extension under /var/db/oah contain the translated results.\n\naot_shared_cache is a (big) file, are there any tools available to extract specific content?\n\n@nohillside I have created a simple python script to show the contents of aot_shared_cache. You can use this script to extract specific content.\n\nA: Rosetta 2 works by doing an ahead-of-time (AOT) translation of the Intel code to corresponding ARM code. It is able to do this efficiently and easily mainly because the M1 CPU contains a special instruction that switches the memory-ordering model observed by the CPU for that thread into a model equivalent to the Intel x86 model (TSO - total store order). This has to do with how programs can expect memory consistency to work when having multiple processors (i.e. cores in this case).\nUser's can observe the translation the first time they launch an Intel app on the M1 as the first launch is slow. The translated code is cached and used on subsequent, much faster launches.\nIf you have a binary that is valid for several different architectures, you can specifically invoke Rosetta 2 by specifying that you want to launch the Intel code. You can do that from the terminal like this:\narch -x86_64 ./mycommand\n\nNote that this setting also applies to any program that the \"mycommand\" process should choose to run.\nRosetta 2 as delivered by Apple in macOS Big Sur is not setup to dynamically invoke translation for a portion of x86 instructions. It is entirely focused on doing an AOT translation of the whole binary in advance. There's no user interface for translating a few small set of instructions on the fly. Rosetta 2 does include a JIT engine that allows translating instructions on the fly (for example if you run an Intel-based browser with a JIT JavaScript engine) - it is however not a general purpose JIT-engine that you could use for other purposes through an API or similar.\nIf you want to do that for research purposes or just out of \"pure interest\", then you could just take the instructions you want to translate and add them to a simple application shell (essentially adding them to a simple main()-only C program for example) and run it. The cached, translated version of the program then includes the translated instructions for inspection.\nThe cache is available in these folders:\n/var/db/oah/\n/System/Library/dyld/aot_shared_cache\n\nThere's no immediate way of \"bridging\" Rosetta 2 to QEMU to allow fast virtualization of Intel Docker images. QEMU contains its own Intel x86 emulation, so you could get it to run Intel Docker images on the M1 without involving Rosetta 2 at all. In this case, \"fast\" is a very subjective measure.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro experiencing random restarts and buggy behavior while running programs My MacBook Pro (15inch Mid 2014) has been displaying odd behavior (slowdowns, problems running certain software packages including jGRASP, beach balls, delays in expected restarts, as well as unexpected restarts) for the last few weeks. The only thing that I can think of is I updated it to Big Sur. However, my issues started several days before I updated it. I reset the PRAM, SMC and ran Malwarebytes but the issues persist. Could someone please advise me on additional steps to take?\n\nA: \"Could someone please advise me on additional steps to take?\"\n\n*\n\n*Check Activity Monitor (in /Applications/Utilities) to see if any processes are using excessive CPU% or Memory.\n\n\n*Make sure that all the software you use is up-to-date, and compatible with Big Sur.  (Very often, the cause of problems after upgrading the OS is because of old, incompatible software that is crashing or hanging -- particularly 'invisible' background processes.)\n\n\n*Create a new user account and test the problem there. If the problem goes away, you know that something in your old user account was causing it. It might be a Login Item, Launch Agent or other process that's programmed to launch, or settings/preferences that are incorrect or corrupt. Go back to the old user account and investigate. If the problem continues, then you know it's a System-level issue, not a user-level one.\n\n\n*Check the logs for messages about crashes, unexpected restarts, and other errors. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/console/cnsl1012/mac\nIt's also possible that problems like unexpected restarts are caused by hardware problems, such as battery, power supply or logic board issues.\n", "Q: App Store apps can't be opened after upgrading macOS 10.12 to 10.13 I updated my Mac from 10.12.6 \"Sierra\" to 10.13.6 \"High Sierra\".\nNow every app that was installed using the App Store is not able to run anymore.\nThey all give me the following 2 screens:\n\n\nAll apps show up like they are not installed:\n\nIf I install them like here (5th item in list):\n\nThen it still won't work.

I don't recall if I installed 2020-002 security update manually on it or through Software Update.\nNow that Apple is releasing even Combo updates for the macOS, which are cumulative updates of point releases, is there any clarity on whether security updates are also now cumulative?\n\nA: Yes, security updates are cumulative since the most recent point release. So, if you're downloading updates manually (to use with offline machines, or in some sort of automated deployment setup, etc), you'll want to install (1) the most recent \"combo update\" followed by (2) the most recent \"security update\".\nFrustratingly, I have been unable to find any official confirmation of this from Apple, but I am relatively confident this is how things work based on my own use. If you try to install an OS X 10.9.5 security update (like 2016-004) before updating from 10.9.4 to 10.9.5, the installer will complain and won't run. However, installing security update 2016-001 followed by 2016-004 seems to have the same affect as just installing 2016-004—you end up on the same build version.\n", "Q: Mail unexpectedly quits - MacBook Pro - macOS High Sierra My Mid 2012 MacBook Pro runs High Sierra 10.13.6 and Mail application version 11.5 modified 01 Oct 2020 by Apple Store Security update 2020-006.

I am using zsh, macOS 11.0.1 (Big Sur), was working on a project and for some stupid reason I decided to write touch ... A file was created in the Desktop so I don't think that it will affect the computer's performance in any way.\nI tried doing vim .. and a document was opened.\nIt contains so many things it is not the one that I just created, also on the top I read /Users/Serax instead of /Users/Serax/Desktop.\nI don't want to damage or delete something that i should not. I tried using mv .. my_stupid_mistake.txt but it didn't work.\nI also checked Desktop in the finder but found nothing.\nIs it safe to do rm ..?\n\nA: touch just creates a new empty file if a previously extant file is not specified. If specified it will update the last modified date.\nAs you created it on your desktop, I'm sure it would be simplest to just grab it and drag it to the trash… saves making any further errors ;)\nIt will cause no issues at all.\nrm has consequences for the unwary that a simple drag & drop doesn't.\n\n*\n\n*. means the current directory\n\n*.. means the directory above the current location\n\nIf you're not sure where you are, rm .. could be somewhat chaotic, as it will delete (potentially all) files from the next directory up.\n\nA: Don't run rm ..!!!\nI just did the exact same thing and it didn't actually create a file.  If you run vim .. you will get a list of folders as the computer recognizes .. as previous directory.\nCheck in Finder and you should see there is no .. file.  If there is a file, try opening it in TextEdit with Finder rather than terminal and if it's empty, you are safe to delete it.\nBut, again, DO NOT RUN rm ..!!!\n\nA: I am writing this because I feel that the currently accepted answer doesn't really explain the user's situation. If you ran touch .., that would not create a new file on your Desktop. That would only be a no-op (no operation) at best and update the modification time of the parent directory at worst. It's completely harmless from the user's perspective and requires no response. The filename .. simply refers to the parent folder/directory of the current location which would be the user's home directory if that was run from the Desktop. touch .. would never create a new file because that name is always in use. If the user did see a new file appear on their Desktop, that is from a completely separate, unrelated event to running touch ...\nAs for what happened with vim .., Vim will show a directory listing of a folder if you try to open a folder like a text file. What the user is seeing is a complete listing of their home directory and why they see Desktop in the \"file\" they opened. That's completely normal and should not be a concern. There is no reason to attempt either mv .. my_stupid_mistake.txt (which will fail because you can't move a parent into a child) or rm ... That command will fail:\nrm ..\nrm: \".\" and \"..\" may not be removed\n\nSo, in summary, don't worry, you did nothing bad by running touch. That is a relatively harmless command. The worst it usually does is creates an empty file, but in this case, it didn't even do that.\n\nA: Do not delete it! In unixish filesystems (including macOS), .. is a link to the parent directory. So if you were in the directory /Users/Serax/Desktop and you ran touch .., that's equivalent to touch /Users/Serax, which just marks your home directory as being modified.\nSimilarly, when you're in /Users/Serax/Desktop, trying to delete .. is equivalent to trying to delete your home directory. If you succeeded, you'd lose all your files. You do not want to do this.\nRunning that touch command will not have damaged anything, so there's nothing that needs to be fixed, deleted, or cleaned up. Just go about your business.\nBTW, do you have a good backup? If not, I'd strongly recommend you make one. Because accidents happen, and sometimes you delete your entire home directory by mistake.\n\nA: touch .. didn't create a file. That is impossible on macOS because the name .. is already taken and refers to the parent directory.\nSo, you have not created a new file, and you don't need to delete anything.\nYour touch .. actually only edited some of the metadata associated with the parent directory (sounds like that's the Desktop directory itself in your case):\nIt updated the\n\n*\n\n*last change time\n\n*last modified time\n\n*last accessed time\n\nTo the time that it was when you ran touch ... You should be able to see these changes by running stat -x ...\n\nSometimes Finder may show files called .., for example perhaps like this:\n\nHowever, this file is not truly named .., it's just that Finder is hiding its extension.\nOpen Finder > Preferences... > Advanced, and enable the \"Show all file extensions\" checkbox to see what its name truly is (for example, it may be ...png)\n", "Q: My mac's UI is randomly freezing for 5-10 seconds throughout the day. How can I figure out what's going wrong? I have a 2017 27\" iMac running macOS 10.14.6. Throughout the day the entire screen will freeze for a period of 5-10 seconds. This happens sporadically and there's no consistent way to trigger it, but toggling Exposé and opening tabs in Safari seem to be the two biggest triggers.\nWhile the screen is frozen, I can still move the cursor around, but I can't interact with anything on screen. All clicks and keystrokes will be delayed until the screen unfreezes, and then they'll all haphazardly fire at once. I'll still be able to hear audio from any application that's running, including music, videos, voice calls, or video calls.\nI tried reinstalling macOS 10.14.6 to fix the issue, but sadly that didn't help. I read somewhere that one of the security updates released by Apple for 10.14.6 could introduce this issue, but I don't have any security updates installed currently and the issue is still there, so that's not it. I also have a 2019 MacBook Pro with 10.14.6 and much of the same software loaded on to it as my iMac, and it's not experiencing this issue.\nIs there anything I can do to debug this, or some other solution I can try?\n\nA: I have discovered how to determine the cause of the freezes. The trick is to take a sample of the system WindowServer process while it is frozen.\nOf course, since I can't interact with the system while it's frozen, I used a separate computer to ssh into my mac, switch that session to the root account with sudo -s, and then execute the following command the moment the system freezes: sample WindowServer 5\nThat creates a sample that shows what the window server was stuck doing while it was frozen, and it consistently showed it locked in the following functions:\n4613 Thread_1658: Main Thread   DispatchQueue_<multiple>\n+ 4613 start  (in libdyld.dylib) + 1  [0x7fff71e563d5]\n+   4613 ???

There seems to be no way to remove such apps when they are no longer needed.\nWhat have I tried?\n\n*\n\n*In App Store, in the grid of apps after clicking on my account, I tried selecting \"Delete app\" from the three dot menu of the app.\n\n*In Launchpad, I tried hitting ⌥ option key and clicking ⦻ which appears next to the app.\n\n*I tried going to Applications folder in Finder and choosing \"Move to trash\" from right-click menu.\n\n*I tried dragging and dropping the app from Applications in Finder and from Launchpad onto the trash bin icon in the dock.\n\nEach time the pop-up asks to login as an administrator. I cannot satisfy it with my Mac login account or my Apple ID which I use for App Store.\nI imagined that the application is installed to a place where the App Store is allowed access to, so I would be able to remove the app with the App Store in the same way that I installed it. I have no problem updating those apps manually in App Store. App Store also updates them automatically for me.\nFor example, here are the permissions of WhatsApp app directory:\n/Applications % ls -la WhatsApp.app\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x@  3 root  wheel   96  2 гру 12:08 .\ndrwxrwxr-x+ 28 root  admin  896  2 гру 18:08 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  10 root  wheel  320  2 гру 12:08 Contents\n/Applications % xattr -l WhatsApp.app \ncom.apple.appstore.store_cohort: 7|date=1605871800000&sf=143492&pgtp=Software&pgid=1147396723&prpg=Search_3d742123-f66f-4798-8833-3ee76553ac1b&ctxt=Search&issrch=1\ncom.apple.appstore.storefront: 143492\ncom.apple.appstore.vendor_name: WhatsApp Inc.\n\nI tried rm -r WhatsApp.app, but, as expected, it returns Permission denied for each file until I terminate it.\nMay it be possible to be able to remove the apps, which I install from App Store, on my own or there is a technical obstacle which definitely prevents me from doing it? If it is not enabled by default, may be the system administrator can enable it somehow, so that I do not need the administrator for removing those apps, without giving me unnecessary permissions?\nI am under macOS Catalina version 10.15.7 (19H15).\nThis question is similar to another one, but in my question I am specifically interested in how to remove the app, not in why the administrative password is requested.\nPlease note that my display language is not English, so some text may be not precise.\n\nA: It is possible a non-administrator user can remove an arbitrary folder, but not guaranteed. The permissions model will show your permissions on the folder.\nYour last shows the directory is locked to everyone except the owner. You are correct you need admin to change that.\nThe App Store generally doesn’t drop a folder, so you might need to open a support case with someone or disclose a screen shot / output shoeing your precise setup for someone to tell your specific case.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-permissions-for-files-folders-or-disks-mchlp1203/mac\nThe article above should cover your attempt to change permissions on the folder in question.

There is no restore option when I right click a folder in my trash. Did I do something wrong with my computer to cause it to do away with this option?\n\n\nA: From comments, it appears the folder may have been deleted by an app/script.\nI general, the only time the Put Back flag is created is if the file/folder is deleted in the 'normal' way, by the user themselves, in Finder.\nI'm afraid i don't know how it does this or the spec of the tagging it uses - perhaps someone smarter than me could provide analysis on that - I just know this through empiricism.\n", "Q: Replaced iPhone 8 Battery, Now Home Button is Dead My battery life was getting pretty poor, but my phone was fully functional otherwise. So I ordered a new one on ifixit it and replaced it.\nIt was not the first iPhone battery I've replaced and it was pretty easy to do. But when I reassembled it, the home button is now dead. Dead in every way. It doesn't perform any function when you push it, it doesn't read you fingerprint, and it gives no taptic feedback.\nImportant to note, I did not disconnect any of that stuff to do the battery. I dislodged the screen, tipped it up, and easily did the battery without taking all those parts out.\nI did turn the phone on before reinstalling the display. I read afterwards that that can disable the home button on older iPhones, but I'm not sure if that applies to the 8.\nI did take the phone apart again, twice. Checked all connectors, they're all great. Theres nothing obvious I can see. I did several hard resets, no affect. I also removed the battery again for a few minutes to fully reset the device.\nAny other ideas what could have happened, and how I can try to fix?\n\nA: You have a couple options.  For diagnosing the issue you could buy a new display to see if that is the issue, or buy a new home button called the JC home button.  It will not restore Touch ID, but it will tell you if the screen cables are broken, or the home button itself.\nBefore you do any of that, try using the old battery again to see if your home button works again.  Also take off the display and reseat the display cables.\nI have replaced several batteries on iPhones and have never had that issue, so I'm guessing a cable isn't seated correctly or a ribbon wire got torn.\n", "Q: Something changed my Time Machine drives to APFS (Case-sensitive) Setting up my dual docking station with two HDDs for Time Machine has me baffled.\nI was told to format the TM HDDs, backing up my iMac running Big Sur, as Mac OS Extended (journaled) which I did.\nI did this two hours ago using Disk Utility and got my dual dock system up and working just fine, or so I thought.\nI was checking out one of the eclecticlightcompany.com’s neat little apps called Mints, chose to check Get Volume Info, and was surprised to see that both the HDDs I had set up two hours ago as Mac OS Extended (journaled) were now formatted as APFS (Case-sensitive).\nWhy is this happening?  Should I be concerned?  Should I reformat these HDD and if so, what format?\n\nA: Thanks you two for replying.  I continued to research the subject and now realize that Apple automatically changes your external HDDs to an APFS format without a \"by your leave\".\nThat said, what I find odd is that instead of just changing them to APFS, Apple changed them to APFS (Case-sensitive).  Truly strange, that.\n", "Q: Is it okay to use an external flash drive to store a Photos Library?

However, tapping on the Open Print Queue... button for that printer also does nothing.\nI have contacted Dymo Support, but have nothing but the automatic email back from them yet.\nHas anyone gotten a Dymo printer to work with the new M1 laptops?\n\nA: To resolve the \"Open Print Queue\" button not working, go to ~/Library/Printers and set each printer to \"Open using Rosetta\" on the \"Get Info\" screen.  This resolved the problem on both of the printers configured on my M1 MacBook Air.\n\nA: Had the same problem with a LabelWriter 450 and had previously called dymo who were aware of the issue.  Was fixed after installing macOS 11.1 without needing to further update my Dymo drivers or software.\n\nA: If you open the spooler you will see an error “Missing USB class driver”. Apparently it’s the way the M1 handles hardware attached to USB. That’s why the printer on AirPrint worked. I’ve heard that Dymo knows about the issue but have no timeframe for a fix or if it will be even addressed.\n\nA: That works for me, too. Installing drivers for HP Photosmart Wireless B109n-z\nI had to install Apple's HP printer drivers, because I'm newly setting up a very old printer. Can't get it to connect to our wireless network, so I'm having to use USB.\nThen set up the printer with the USB drivers. It creates a printer device in ~/Library/Printers.\nThen configure the print queue to open in Rosetta.

Okay, Apple are really starting to freak me out (I don't use them much). Here's the timeline of my story:\nMy daughter's MacBook Air (2017-ish) that she needs for school would not update to Big Sur because it had a pityingly small 128G SSD. So, I decided to spring for a 500G one and get her device to a more acceptable level.\nI first tried this on my less important Mac Mini, swapping out the 500G for a 1T, though still spindle rather than SSD (I don't need the speed on that box). A Time Machine full backup was done in preparation for restoring, the new drive was inserted, and I used recovery to get everything back. That worked well.\nDaughter's machine, not so well. Trying to do a normal recovery with command-R and restoring from Time Machine, resulted in a failure, the text which I don't remember. But it did seem very fast compared to the following step.\nDoing it with command-shift-R seemed to work but consistently ended up rebooting with a dreaded:\n         \n\nSo, I thought, forget the automatic recovery, I'll just install Big Sur and try to get the data from Time Machine afterwards (I'd read a migration would allow this). I left the install running and went to work.\nThe first thing I noticed was that it didn't ask me for my wi-fi password, despite the fact it was a brand new SSD. I can only assume certain stuff is stored in the Mac somewhere, separate from the drive.\nThe thing that really amazed me was that, when I got home, the machine seemed to be fully done. It had my daughter's account information, all her files that she knew about, all the apps she had installed, the screen-time settings, the school stuff like Office 365, and everything that I know to look for.\nThis is despite the fact neither the Time Machine backup nor original SSD were available during the Big Sur install. I know Mac aficionados say it \"just works\" but this is bordering on \"horror movie\" scary.\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is:\n\n*\n\n*How did this actually manage to do all this? Is there more stuff than just the wi-fi password stored on the device outside of the disk? This is about the only way I can see this happening, though it couldn't possibly be a large amount of data, surely?\n\n\n*Can I be reasonably certain it did it properly? I want to avoid the drama of visiting IT support next year when she starts school, because I may have stuffed something up.\n\nA: Though iCloud does store more than just Wi-Fi passwords by default (assuming you're using it), it isn't the primary culprit. Unlike some other operating systems, macOS doesn't wipe everything when installing (or reinstalling) the OS by default. While I don't have a definitive list of files it touches (and it likely varies by macOS version), you can typically assume that it will primarily touch system-related files.\nWhat appears to have happened in your case is that your initial \"failed\" installation actually copied over many of your personal files successfully from the Time Machine backup; however, for one reason or another, something related to the OS installation failed and prevented the drive from being made into a bootable disk. When you re-installed macOS after the fact, those files remained in place, and macOS simply installed the OS alongside them.\nGiven the fact that the initial Time Machine migration failed, the exact state of what was restored isn't entirely clear. I'd recommend wiping the entire disk via Recovery Mode, reinstalling, and then using the setup utility to restore from Time Machine. Remember to format the SSD as APFS rather than HFS!\n", "Q: Wifi Tx rate in airport and speedtest cli upload/download speeds are drastically different When I run airport -I or opt click my wifi icon, it says my wifi Tx rate is around 700 Mbps, but when I run the speedtest-cli command, it says my upload speed is 20 Mbit/s and download speed is 30 Mbit/s. Shouldn't the upload speed and Tx rate be the same thing? What is the difference?\n\nA: Tx rate is the speed of connection between your computer and the WiFi; this is not the same as the speed of your network connection provided by your ISP. So you might have a high speed in your local network, but accessing the internet has lower speed limited by your internet plan (which is what speedtest-cli tests for as it establishes a connection with a server somewhere else).\nIf you want to test LAN speed, use iperf on local devices.\n", "Q: Where are / are the \"counting hand\" cursors used in macOS I was looking around inside the system folders in MacOS and where the cursors are there are 3 cursors I've never seen before called countinguphand, countingdownhand and countingupandownhand. You can find them in /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/cursors(I'm on mojave so it may be different), Or go to System/Library/ and search for PDFs. I haven't found any info about these cursors online, it doesn't look like css supports them... So are they just leftover or is there any use for them I can't think of? Thanks in advance for any info!\n\nA: They're probably leftover\nOrigins and Classic Mac OS\nThe gloved hand icon, designed by Susan Kare, has been with us since the first version of Mac OS. However, it looks like the counting version didn't appear until System 6.0.4. System 6.0.4 introduced a new installer version—3.0—designed to support customizable multi-disk installations. As part of this, we get a few new loading icons! This includes the hand in question, which plays a counting-up animation during installation.\n\nFun fact: if you type \"ski\" on the setup screen, you get a little Easter egg: an alert box which allows you to choose from one of five different idle cursors!\n\nYou'll notice that (among others, including what looks to be the precursor to the current idle \"busy but clickable\" icon) is the classic watch. However, notice the hands; this isn't quite the same version. System 6.0.4 didn't include an animated watch—only a static one—but the one in this installer includes an animated one. We can confirm this by using ResEdit to inspect the installer.\n\nEven after installation, the animated icons aren't copied over to the system.\n\nThis means that there's no way for other programs (or even the system) to use it, short of manually copying the icon from the installer and using it themselves. Different icons came and went between installer versions (7.0 and 7.1's installers do away with the Easter egg and cut the icons down to the animated wristwatch and hand), but they remain exclusive to the installer. I would say this was an intentional decision to have exclusive icons to the installer, but the animated icons (including the famous animated wristwatch) were later added to the System installation (I'm not sure by exactly which version, but sometime between System 7.1 and Mac OS 9.)\n\nSo if they were added intentionally, surely something must have been using them. The watch certainly gets used plenty; however, I haven't been able to find anything that uses the hand outside of the installer. Further, there's no option I could find in the Control Panels (Appearance, General Controls, Mouse, Screen, Text, etc.)  to switch to use the hand over the wristwatch, so it's not an optional extra.\nOS X\nThe wristwatch was replaced by the blue waiting animation during the jump to Mac OS X (though it wasn't respected in all conditions, such as the standard cursor displaying in response to the CSS cursor: wait; as recently as macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra), but stuck around regardless and all the way until macOS 10.15 Catalina with the deprecated Carbon interface (and occasionally some other apps for no clear reason, though it may have something to do with system resources or other GUI frameworks). Just like with Classic Mac OS though, there's no way to swap out either the old wristwatch or the current blue-spinny-ball for the counting hand through any \"normal\" settings. The hand, including the counting version, has also received updated artwork throughout the years, so it's not just like they've been left unattended.\nSo, if it's not being used as an alternative to the waiting cursor, could it be used for something else?\nDigging a bit deeper, we find that the cursor is represented using an NSCursor object under macOS. Here we can see all the different types of static cursors available to developers—including the hand, in three of the six positions: closed, open, and pointing. No animated cursors though, and we're still missing two of the positions.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find Apple's source code for the NSCursor. However, GNUstep, an open source GUI framework that tracks pretty closely to the official Apple Cocoa framework has an NSCursor class. Unfortunately, still no direct mention of the other hand positions. There is a count method, but there's no clear documentation for it nor code usages I could find, let alone anything to tie it to the hand. The only macOS application I was able to think of that  features a regular countdown is the Screenshot application; however, it doesn't use the hand, and neither does its older counterpart, Grab (despite the name.)\nSo, my guess? They needed three of the six positions, someone ported all of them for sake of completeness, and no one has seen any reason to remove them. As far as I can tell, without manually including the assets or work by the end user, they're pretty much inaccessible to developers since macOS's sole remaining native GUI framework provides no clean way to access them.\n", "Q: Bluetooth app with XAMPP permission problem in Mac OS 11 I using a web GUI for controlling some Bluetooth devices.

It can be run in various ways such as for example inside httpd in an Apache module, as a CGI executable or through a process manager such as FPM.\nThe important thing here is that you must give the Bluetooth privileges to the process or parent of the process (or grandparent, etc.) that is actually running your PHP code.\nFor example that could be your php-fpm daemon in a FPM setup.\n", "Q: Is there any command to check if a download is in progress on macos?

Reading around, almost none of it is likely to run on the latest version of MacOS without serious issues.\nThe OS's age has become a problem for almost everything else - the latest browsers won't run so more and more websites are unusable, and most downloadable software simply won't install (we had to dual-boot it with the highest OS that the hardware supports just to allow him to do iPad sync).\nI've read that it should be possible to buy a newer Mac and run a virtualised copy of Mountain Lion in something like Parallels.

And can anyone comment on how well old Adobe apps run inside a VM, both in terms of performance and potential compatibility issues?\n(The creative software is the main thing he uses the Mac for, so if it's going to be sluggish or painful to use in practice then maybe a different plan would be better.)\nEdit: Sorry - a bit more detail!:\niMac 24-inch, Early 2009, 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 8Gb DDR3, Geforce 9400 256Mb, upgraded with an SSD boot drive\nOS X 10.8.5, and Adobe Suite CS5\n(No specific model in mind as an upgrade, min spec recommendation welcome)\n\nA: This is difficult, at best, to tell without the specs on the current Mac and what Mac you are planning on getting. Even then determining how well the Adobe apps in question will run is entirely subjective. How \"well\" something will run depends on how the person using the virtualized macOS perceives it to run.\nThat said, you should likely not purchase an entry level model of Mac (EG cheapest, iMac, cheapest MacBook, cheapest Mac mini, etc) with base level storage and RAM.\nThat said Parallels (and for that matter VMware Fusion) will both allow you to virtualize macOS on macOS and provide the ability to run those Adobe Apps that your father uses.\nNote that transplanting an image of the old Mac's drive to use in the virtualization software might be more problematic than just installing a fresh copy of Mountain Lion in your virtualization environment, updating it and then using Migration Assistant to copy over his settings and apps. However other people may have better advice on that front.\n", "Q: Determine which application the media keys will control When you press e.g. the pause key, the Mac OS will send that to whichever running application is playing media. How can I programmatically find out what application this is? And is there any other information available, such as the name of the currently playing media?\nI'm looking for a command line tool, an API, or a scripting interface; I'm not picky.\n\nA: There was an app (no longer supported) called Media Key Forwarder that allowed users to decide which app would receive the Play/Pause command. Its code is open source.\nIt wasn't the only one: BeardedSpice also allows users to control the play/pause button behavior, and it's also open source.\nI quickly browsed their source codes looking for a specific piece of code to embed here but it was not immediately obvious to me.

When using mixed speeds, your computer will under clock the higher speed cards to match the lower speed cards so they all have the same speed, but since the speeds are so close together (2666 MHz vs. 2400MHz) you wouldn't notice a difference.\nAn extra 8GB ram is totally worth the 266 MHz speed difference.\n", "Q: Using automator or script to turn on wifi in case of ethernet cable failure, and vice versa? For the moment, I have slightly faulty thunderbolt port on my 2013 mac book pro that I use to connect to the internet. My wifi works fine, but I prefer the increase in speed with the direct line. My concern is that if I accidentally bump anything there it may disconnect. While it doesn't take long to go to network pref. and connect to my network, I'm wondering if there would be a way to use automator or some other means to configure so that in case of a failure on either side for any reason I could automatically connect to the other?\nAny advice appreciated!\n\nA: Isin't 'Set Service Order' in System Preferences > Network sufficient (click  circle with three dots inside at the bottom of left pane to see it)?\nSetting Thunderbolt Bridge first and active and WiFi second and active should make MacOS switch automatically if first connection becomes unavailable.\n", "Q: How can the macOS calendar show (1 more...) daily events in the month view?

How do I get the path? Or how do I otherwise delete one of the backups listed by tmutil listbackups?\n\nA: In addition to the combination of -d and -t, you can also use the -p parameter to provide the full path to the backup (if you know it):\ntmutil delete [-d backup_mount_point -t timestamp] [-p path]\n\nThis works for me:\nsudo tmutil delete -p /Volumes/Time\\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2021-04-03-123111/\n\nThis is on macOS Big Sur 11.3.\n\nA: The Big Sur syntax changed, but you need to specify the volume and the timestamp with -d and -t:\nsudo tmutil delete -d /Volumes/Time\\ Machine -t 2020-11-18-100936\n\nYou don't need to specify the Backups.backupdb folder or the backup machine.  I had done tmutil setdestination /Volumes/Time\\ Machine previously (where Time Machine is the name of your drive.)\n\nA: This is a pretty tentative answer, but too much for a comment...\nBig Sur & Time Machine on APFS will always require the entire volume. You can't do anything other - see APFS changes in Big Sur: how Time Machine backs up to APFS, and more\n\nAPFS doesn’t support directory hard links, so can’t use the same mechanism when storing Time Machine backups.

Why would the phone show a different MAC address than is actually connecting to the network?\nAny insight appreciated.\n\nA: For privacy reasons, iOS randomizes its MAC address so that public Wi-Fi networks (and other Wi-Fi based tracking networks) cannot use your unique unchanging MAC address to track you from place to place.\nThat 4A:… MAC address has the 2's place bit in the first octet set, which signifies that it is a locally administered MAC address (which in this context means it was randomly self-generated) not the guaranteed globally unique address that's burnt into the hardware. The 88:… address does not have the first octet's 2's place bit set, so it is the guaranteed globally unique address that's burnt into the hardware.\nIf you go into the iOS Wi-Fi settings for that network, you can turn off the \"Private Address\" switch to get your iPhone to use its unique, trackable MAC address on that network.

Your VPN administrator has enabled a \"full tunnel,\" such that all traffic goes over the VPN. If your VPN administrator is willing to switch to split tunnels, it will work fine.\nThe longer, potentially getting you fired answer: you can use openconnect (installed via homebrew) to connect to the VPN. This will still have the full tunnel issue, but it won't continue to screw with the network routes after the initial connection - so you can forcibly enable split tunnels.\nTo connect, something like:\n# openconnect yourvpnserver.com -u username --authgroup \"your group\" \n\nThen you can fix your routing table:\n# sudo route change default 1.2.3.4 \n\nwhere 1.2.3.4 is your normal home network default route. You will not be able to access any resources over the VPN after you do this, until you add routes for them:\n# sudo route -nv add 5.6.7.8 -interface utun0\n\nwhere 5.6.7.8 is the IP of the VPN resource you want to access, and utun0 is the VPN interface.\nBut again, risk of being fired if caught, etc, etc.\n", "Q: Local policy error when disabling SIP on Big Sur/M1 I'm trying to disable System Integrity Protection on an M1 Mac.\ncsrutil disable as well as csrutil authenticated-root disable fail with an error:\n\ncsrutil: Failed to update security configuration for \"Macintosh HD\": Failed to create local policy\n\nHow can I avoid this failure?

It's available via Homebrew with brew install cliclick.\nThen I figured out the coordinates of the time in the top-right, which when clicked, opens the notification centre. This took a bit of experimentation.\nThen I figured out the coordinates of the close button that appears on hover. Again this took a bit of experimentation.\nThen I wrote a script that uses cliclick and these coordinates to open the Notification Center, move the mouse over where the \"clear\" button appears, sleeps for 500 milliseconds to give it time to appear, and then click it. It worked!\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH # make sure cliclick binary is on the path\ncliclick c:1900,10               # click on the time to open Notification Center\ncliclick -w 500 m:1570,45 c:.    # move mouse over the close button, wait for it to appear, then click it\n\nI then tried to get this running as an Automator service. I got it running from within Automator but though the script worked there, it refused to work when I assigned it to a keyboard shortcut. I bashed my head against a brick wall trying out different permissions etc until giving up.\nI tried the HotKey app, but had the same result.\nEventually I thought about trying an Alfred workflow, so I could open Alfred with Cmd+Space and then type \"Clear notifications\" to clear them. Much more verbose than a keyboard shortcut but... it worked! And no mouse needed. My best guess as to why is that when Alfred runs the script, it always runs from within Alfred, and Alfred already has the required permissions to move the mouse and click on stuff, but when I try to attach an Automator service to a keyboard shortcut, that service runs with whatever permissions the currently in focus app has.\nThis feels like a horribly brittle solution (what happens when I'm not using my external monitor??) and it seems rubbish that there's no built-in way to do this, but at least it works.\nTL;DR a combination of a script using cliclick and an Alfred workflow to run it.\n\nA: I've tried most of the solutions offered here, but none has quite worked as well as I want. I've since tried using Keysmith, and been pretty happy with the results.\nKeysmith offers an existing shortcut for this. It looks like this:\n\nThis gives you the ability to press ⌘ esc to close notifications (from any application).\nThe only issue I had with it was that once the notifications had been closed, the active window of the current application lost focus. Fortunately, you can add an additional step in the Keysmith shortcut to regain the focus of the active window: ⌃F4. That looks like this in Keysmith:\n\n\nA: Thank you @lunzwell.

I use it to clear out all the notifications I get with an external drive.\n\nA: This answer suggests that on Big Sur in its current release there is no satisfactory way to dismiss notifications with a keyboard. Instead, this answer explains alternative ways to dismiss them that are not noted elsewhere in this thread.\nTwo-finger swipe right on the notification group works on Big Sur with the Macbook's trackpad (not sure about Yosemite). It also works with left-click and drag to the right. I assume this would work with an Apple Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad as well. I personally find both the two-finger swipe and left-click and drag to be easier to do than clicking the X icon then clicking clear all. I find coordinating the twice-click in such a small area is very difficult.\nThis doesn't \"clear\" all notifications permanently. They will still show if you open the notification sidebar. They will also show if another message comes through; instead of seeing 1 notification it will show N + 1 notifications available.\nThis idea was noted in a comment in another answer: Dismiss MacOS Big Sur notifications with keyboard.\nThe reason I am suggesting that there is no satisfactory way to dismiss notifications with a keyboard is: an automated script is noticeably slow for large numbers of notifications, the Keysmith solution didn't work on Big Sur (it errored), pkill/killall NotificationCenter didn't work dismiss the notifications (which means a keyboard shortcut for it wouldn't help). I did not try the clickclick solution, I was concerned I would waste too much time trying to get it to work and that it would experience the same delays as an automated script.\nThis thread is similar to How do I clear All OS X notifications with 1 click?.\n", "Q: LG Ultrawide 21:9, MBP 2017 no HiDIPI 2560x1080 I have a LG Ultrawide 34WN650 and a 2017 MacbookPro(Big Sur) with both Radeon Pro 560 4 GB\nand Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB.

The one that seem most knowledgeable mentioned that as of now, it's impossible to recover data from the memory of an iPhone 6 because of data flow encryption between the logic board and the NAND memory chip. For the iPhone 4, people had discovered how to reverse engineer it, but no one had done it for the iPhone 6 yet, so no one in the world would be able to recover data. They suggested I call and check again in a few months. Is this true?\nSecond update: Here is a photograph of the motherboard after dismantling the phone. It seems intact to me:\n\n\nA: What matters most is the the motherboard and its components are in a good state, anything around (battery, screen, cameras, etc) can be replaced without touching the encryption chain. If it is broken (solder, contacts, etc), then you'll need to rebuild the chain; which is possible (check with harddrive recovery companies); if components are broken, you still can recover the chain with specialized services (using microscopes, white room and microelectronics) to get the AES key (I think hard coded/stored in the SoC/CPU if not in a security chip), and then I think only the memory chip is needed (which does not store the key).\nIf you can show a photograph of the motherboard instead of the screen, one might be able to tell more about the actual situation.\n", "Q: How to trust an invalid certificate in Big Sur / Safari 14 Since installing Safari 14, I can't find a way of trusting an invalid SSL certificate (either expired or set up for the wrong hostname).\nI used to be able to click on the address bar and then trust that specific certificate but can't find a way to do that in Safari anymore.\n\nA: Note: Don't do this for sites you don't trust!\nThis might not be the simplest solution, but it's the only one I could come up with (thanks to https://serverfault.com/questions/139728/how-to-download-the-ssl-certificate-from-a-website# for explaining how to download the certificate).

I want to create a workflow on my Mac where I select text on a Chrome webpage and then press a hotkey combination to change the title of tab to be the selected text.\nI generate lots of tabs that get identical titles and I want to tag them with something based on the contents to be able tell them apart. I use the Chrome extension Tabs Outliner that displays a tree diagram of my tabs with their titles. Once the tab structure is in Tabs Outliner, I can do various things like copy the tree of that window and paste it into Google docs as an archive of the tabs I created, my research, testing versions, whatever.\nBut all my various archiving flows depend on the tabs having meaningful titles. The website(s) are not doing that sufficiently for my purposes, so I want to manually tag them, in most cases as quickly and easily as possible. Select text and press a hotkey seems about as quick as I can get short of having the computer read my mind and track my eye movements. Maybe add the complexity of stopping to allow me to edit the pasted text and then pressing another hotkey to confirm and move on.\nMy idea is to have the hotkey initiate something like the following automatic flow.\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+C: Copy the selected text.\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+A: Open the RenameTab Chrome extension.\n\n*Cmd+V: Paste the copied text into the RenameTab text field in the dropdown.\n\n*CLICK the \"Lock Title (beta)\" button in the RenameTab dropdown.\n\n*Ctrl+Tab: Move to the next browser tab.\n\nI can write a simple Service to send all the keystrokes. But don't know how to automate the Click that is required.\nI want to be able to do this approximately 20-40 times a day, day after day, so I cannot presume that the Chrome window will be at the same screen location, on the same monitor, the same window size, or any of the other assumptions that basic click-automation scripts like Cliclick seem to require.\nI can presume that the RenameTab dropdown will be at the same relative location to the Upper Right corner of the Chrome window (actually relative to the extension button which is mostly stable). The image here is on Windows, from the Chrome web store, but I'm working on a Mac.\n\nI've found references to Selenium as possibly able to do that click, but the Selenium tutorials that I've found want to put me through weeks of becoming a Test Automation expert.\nI presume that Selenium can do its thing in a way that defaults to the current browser window, current browser tab. But how do I tell Selenium where to click?\nCan Selenium recognize that the browser frame, not the current web page, has displayed a dropdown window and can it find the button by name? All the stuff I've been able to understand about Selenium so far is that it seems to deal with the displayed web page, so maybe it cannot deal with being able to identify content that's generated by the browser frame itself.\nDo I maybe need to forgo Selenium instead using more basic click automation tools and capture the current window size and then subtract the coordinates based on the Upper Right corner to get the click coordinates relative to the current window? Do I need to also deal with the current window position on the screen?\nSorry for dumping all the details, but I don't know how to ask the question more simply without running the risk of presuming what the solution is when I really don't know. So I'm trying to explain exactly what I want to do, in what context, and why. In researching this, over and over I find that the descriptions of various tools are enthusiastic descriptions of how the tool works in use cases that don't seem to overlap with mine, without ever explaining the underlying operating mechanism so that I can determine whether or not the tool is even possibly equipped to do the job.\nAny experienced guidance would be appreciated. If you can tell me things like \"Cliclick presumes this so you won't be able to ...\" or \"Selenium can only deal with what it gets from ... so you'll have to ...\" or point me to where the basic operating principles are outlined, I would be grateful.\nThanks.\n\nA: I haven't found a free solution, but I've been able to solve my problem with the free-trial version of Keyboard Maestro.\nKBM allows you to record key clicks and mouse motions, and with an option on the Recording process, you can include real-time time delays that can then be edited to speed up the process without it zipping along too fast for the apps and app switcher to keep up.\nOn thing about KBM that is very useful, as hinted at in my problem description, is that the mouse clicks are initially recorded relative to the upper right corner of the screen or the frontmost window, BUT, after recording, you can change what the zero-point is for the mouse coordinates. In my case, changing the mouse clicks to be relative to the upper right corner means that they should be pretty stable w.r.t. where the RenameTabs Chrome extension dropdown dialog appears.\nI still don't know how to capture the current window size, which would be required for a totally free solution. One option I've thought of is to use another Chrome extension, Easy Window Resize, to ensure that that the window is always at a predefined size so that I can indeed use Cliclick relative to the upper left corner. That could be a free solution.\nI probably won't go that way for my own purposes because, the other features of KBM make it look like a worthwhile investment for me.\nDISCLAIMER: I am just a customer, currently using the free version of KBM and am not affiliated with the company in any way. I haven't even paid them anything yet.\n", "Q: Big Sur - unable to focus any app or make mouse/keyboard inputs after waking from sleep? Update 9-Jul-2021: This issue appears to have been resolved with macOS version 11.4. I am no longer experiencing the problem after this update.\nProblem Description\nSince upgrading to Big Sur I have been experiencing, sometimes multiple times per day, an issue where after waking the machine from sleep:\n\n*\n\n*I am unable to enter text input with the keyboard. Typing into text inputs produces the system alert sound, as if typing is not allowed. Some shortcut combinations like Cmd+Tab still work. Using the on-screen keyboard produces the same results, so it appears not to have anything to do with the keyboard hardware.\n\n\n*I am unable to click on some kinds of UI controls with the mouse. Clicking on a window will bring it to the foreground. But links on webpages have to be double-clicked to navigate, as if the first click is ignored. Other kinds of controls such as the sidebar in Finder don't respond to clicks at all.\n\n\n*When clicking between windows belonging to different apps, the active app in the system menubar does not update. So I may have a Finder window in the foreground, but Chrome's menu will still appear in the menubar.\n\n\n*If I switch to a different desktop space, a different app may appear in the menubar (depending on what is open in that space) but then the menubar becomes complete unresponsive and does not respond to clicks after that.\n\n\n*It's obvious when looking at some apps like System Preferences or Activity Monitor that even when their window has been brought to the foreground, the app isn't fully \"focused\", as some controls remain greyed out in the way they do when the app is in the background. (I think this gives a big clue about what's going on - is something stealing focus and won't allow any other app to be focused?).\n\n\n*Putting the machine back to sleep does not resolve the problem, it remains in the same broken state after waking again. Using fast user switching to jump to another user profile reveals the other profile to be unaffected, but switching back to the first user returns it still in the broken state.\n\n\n*I have tried force quitting Finder and sending kill signals to SystemUIServer and the Dock process, but this has no impact.\n\n\n*The only solution I have found is to log out and log in again, or restart. Sometimes it is not even possible to log out, as the menubar may become unresponsive and the Cmd+Shift+Q shortcut doesn't always work, in which case a forced restart from the Login Window is required (the Login Window itself behaves normally throughout).\nThis issue began immediately after upgrading to Big Sur, so I think it must be a macOS bug - but as I have been unable to locate any other reports of this issue by Googling all the terms I can think of, it is conceivable that the problem results from a particular combination in my system of third-party apps or peripherals.\nMy machine is a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) with i9 and Radeon Pro 5500M. Running Big Sur 11.0.1. I usually have a Thunderbolt 3 dock attached with external display, USB keyboard and mouse, but the problem has also occurred when roaming with nothing plugged in.\nQuestion\nGoing with the focus-stealing theory, is there a way to debug this by determining which process owns the currently focused app/window in macOS? (I am able to run terminal commands by ssh'ing in from another machine when the problem occurs.)\nAlternatively, is this a known issue or has anybody else experienced this? Are there other solutions or workarounds I can try to resolve the problem without logging out?\n\nA: This has been happening to me as well, but after reading what Juan said about Touch ID, I tried resting my finger on the Touch ID sensor and it seems to fix the focus issue. Looks like its some sort of bug where the \"Use Touch ID to unlock\" screen isn't showing but the desktop is being shown instead.\n\nA: I have not experienced this issue after disabling Touch ID unlock, by unchecking the option to Use Touch ID for: ... Unlocking your Mac in System Preferences > Touch ID.\nThis requires me to enter my password instead of using my fingerprint to unlock after waking from sleep. Somehow that appears to avoid this issue.\n\nA: For those of you who wish to avoid doing a hard reboot with the power button\nsudo launchctl bootout gui/501\nwill log you out via the CLI (which might be considered preferable/more graceful way to recover). I had to do this a few times now, caveat is I already had SSH enabled and did this from a different host. (also, should mention \"501\" should be the desired user ID - whatever echo $UID returns).\nI've run into this a few times now on my MBP16\" on both 11.0.1 and 11.1, but never experienced it on Catalina. Those of you MBP16\" users still on Catalina, I would suggest you stay on it until this gets sorted out.\nI use an Anker USB-C hub and will have to test and see if this reoccurs without it. Didn't install any drivers for the Anker, and my Big Sur install is a clean install, not an upgrade, so all my kexts are notarized and obtained from Apple (no 3rd parties). It seems likely to me this issue is on Apple and I do hope the relevant team(s) fix soon.\nIf anyone knows of the appropriate Radar(s) please add a link this post.\nUpdate: just happened again, continues to be very annoying. Used launchctl bootout to avoid the hard reboot. Will try and fiddle with TouchID next time.\nUpdate 2: Using TouchID a subsequent time seems to be a clunky but viable workaround. TouchID once to unlock in the usual way, and again once you're in. Silly but has been working. I hope 11.2 fixes this\nUpdate 3: I installed 11.2 recently, and have unlocked a few times. At least so far, the issue hasn't happened again. Let's hope it stays that way.\nUpdate 4: Spoke too soon - just happened again on 11.2 :/. Seems it's not fixed unfortunately\nUpdate 5: Just happened again on 11.2.1 :/\nUpdate 6: Just happened again on 11.2.2, disappointing since the update description specifically called out USB-C hubs...\nUpdate 7: +1 on 11.2.3. Anyone know the Radar #(s)?\nUpdate 8: +1 on 11.3.0. Sigh...\n\nA: Same problem for me with my MacBook Pro 13” 2020! It started happening yesterday, I think it has to be related to the 11.0.1 update because I have Big Sur installed since two weeks and I had no issue until yesterday.\nIn my case the only way is to shutdown MacBook from  the Touch ID button and power on again. I hope Apple will launch an update soon.\n\nA: I had exactly the same symptoms and previously added a comment. However, I then removed all 4 of my USB input devices connected via USB3 docks, and the problem has not reoccurred. The symptoms also seem to be compatible with an input device problem.\nCommonalities: MacBook Pro 16 (2019) i9 Radeon 5500M, Big Sur 11.0.1.\nI have 2 USB3 docks, each with an HDMI external monitor and 4 USB input devices (Logitech USB-PS/2 mouse, Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 joystick, CH Pro Pedals USB, www.tigerfly.net Chaplet Systems IR receiver). I'm assuming one of these caused the problem and will try plugging each in in turn.\nUpdate: unplugging USB devices made no difference. But when the problem happened, locking the computer and then unlocking with password made it functional again without a forced reboot. Agree with the proposed solution, it seems to be related to unlocking via TouchID. The same problem persists in Big Sur 11.1.\n\nA: I've had this experience too, and my solution was to use the Touch Bar to put the laptop back to sleep, then re-awaken and unlock again. Focus came back properly the second time.\nThe icon to put the laptops back to sleep is a circle with a horizontal line through the lower half. If you don't have it bound, you can do so by going to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Customise Control Strip.... and drag the icon to the Touch Bar.\n\nA: I've suffered with this issue for a few months now.\nI've got a MacBook Pro 15\" 2019.\n\n*\n\n*2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9\n\n*32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4\n\n*Radeon Pro Vega 16 4 GB\n\nI tried every suggested solution listed here.\n\n*\n\n*TouchID enabling/disabling.\n\n*Putting the system to sleep and re-awakening\n\n*Resting my finger on the TouchID key.\n\n*Logging out and back in.\n\n*Changing the Display Scaling\n\n*Disconnecting/Reconnecting USB devices (like an external HD)\n\n*Enabling Drift Screen Saver\n\n*Enabling/Disabling Screen Mirroring (Airplay)\n\n*etc\n\nNone of them worked for me. The only thing to date that worked for me was a complete reboot.\nInterestingly, some had suggested that they'd had issues with external monitors and that disconnecting it (and/or USB devices) brought some relief. I'd ignored this question for ages because I didn't ever have an external monitor connected. My issue was with the internal graphics card (I assumed).\nJust now I tried something new which worked. Connecting an external monitor via HDMI through an adaptor. Boom. Flickering gone. No reboot required.\nHowever, it's not a complete solution. When now just testing to see what happens when I disconnect the external HDMI monitor, the internal monitor's redraws and flickering issues return. Reconnecting the HDMI monitor again returns sanity.\nSo the fix for now (for mobility) is still a full reboot unfortunately.\n\nA: MacBook Pro 16\" 2019, macOS Big Sur 11.2.3. The issue started immediately with Big Sur upgrade, I had to reboot several times a day before I found this thread and tried all workarounds. Connecting and disconnecting external display few times restored sanity without reboot. After connecting-disconnecting external display the issue is completely gone, MBP is going from sleep OK, Touch ID is enabled.\n\nA: I found the culprit on my system: FortiClient VPN.\nWhat happens is that whenever I get disconnected from the VPN (for example, after closing and reopening the laptop), the keyboard stops working.\nThe only place where it works is the FortiClient window, and if I connect again, keyword input is restored everywhere.\nIt looks like I'm not the only one: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/big-sur-2020-16-inch-macbook-pro-keyboard.2269859/ and https://forum.fortinet.com/tm.aspx?m=191558\n\nA: I have something like this issue where I've determined the cause to be the interface is stuck (i.e. during the zoom transition) between Mission Control opened/closed states. It's usually very difficult to detect or realize that this is the problem because it only gets stuck just before Mission Control would have been completely closed (or just a frame or 2 after its opening) when the zoom transition animation state is only a few frames in, i.e. you can't really tell Desktop was in process of zooming out. Anyway, if I do my gesture for Mission Control to let it \"complete\" the animation from that point, everything goes back to normal.\nI believe the symptoms occur because input is generally /dev/null'ed during the animation transition between Desktop and Mission Control.\nThis certainly is invariably the problem for me; not only does this effect a fix 100% of the time, but also you can sort of see the few pixels of zooming that had taken place when you bring the desktop view back.\nHere's a demonstrative video example of how this animation looks, and how it looks when it is stuck.\n", "Q: Display the current network use (upload and download) in the notification bar on iPad I'm looking for a program for iPadOS 13.7 compatible with ipad pro 9.7 inch (2016) that displays the current network use (upload and download) in the notification bar.

Usually, you can simply open either and then do whatever you want, e.g. clone one disk, save the data,...\n\nA: Don't panic, It can probably be the EFI partition, a simple reinstall (without erasing anything) will do the job.\nNor, if you have another Mac/PC, you can boot your Macbook on which you want to recover files, in target disk mode (by pressing \"D\" at boot) and connect it on your other Mac/PC.\n", "Q: Is there a workaround to pay for several years (stock up) with in-app annual subscription? Usually subscription services let you stock up subscriptions ahead of time. You can buy 3 annual subscriptions at the same day and have 3 years of subscription.\nApp Store in-app annual subscription doesn't let you to buy ahead. If you pay for 1 year, you have to wait till the end of that year to pay for the 2nd year. You can't buy the second year at the same day you bought the 1st, nor can you buy a 2nd year if there are still 4 months of the first year.\nIs there a workaround to bypass that limitation?\nIt says at subscriptions page that I can cancel at any time and continue to use my annual subscription until it expires. If I cancel and there are 4 months of subscription left, will I be able to re-purchase annual subscription right away? Will this new subscription start after the first one or will it overwrite the 4 months that I had left?\n\nA: I don’t think you get any sort of hidden features with subscriptions through Apple. Since this is a service, it’s not baked into any OS upgrade or app, it’s just logic on how the system works.\nI would reach out to the developer if you need this, but I would caution you - how could Apple offer a refund for something they might not even be able to deliver in 3 years. If the developer offers a side registration process - they an do whatever they please, but Apple has been pretty set on the terms for a while - so anything could change, but I would expect them to be selling annual passes at the longest term for as long as they’re on the hook to provide refunds when a purchase has issues.\nI think you have a very good grasp - there’s no hidden workarounds here - it’s like asking a bank to change how they grant interest on certificates of deposit.

Examining htop on iTerm2, I'm finding that my machine is maxing out swap space while leaving ~4GB of normal RAM. Why?! This seems like it's going to really slow up my machine. What's going on here? Is there something I can do to improve the distribution?\n\n\nA: When your computer runs out of physical RAM, it swaps some of the data in RAM out to disk.\nLater when the need for RAM decreases, you will have a situation where you have free RAM, but still an amount of data swapped out to RAM.\nYou could argue that the operating system should start swapping that data back into RAM immediately. However there are arguments that this is not a good strategy, namely because:\na) swapping in resources takes away resources from other programs running\nb) swapping in resources will occupy RAM that another program might need in a short while, provoking another swap out\nThese are reasons why the swapped out data isn't immediately swapped in when RAM is freed. Instead it is swapped in when needed.\n", "Q: Hide file previews in Dock folders?

So did I. After a bit of a struggle, I got OpenToonz 1.4 working with ffmpeg on a Mac running macOS Catalina (10.15). I installed the \"static files.\" I did not build from source. Here is what I did:\n\n*\n\n*download ffmpeg, ffprobe, ffplay and ffserver from the download page.

However, without opening the MacBook it is very unlikely to find the actual cause. You should still try the different startup modes. D for hardware diagnose, opt cmd p r for NVRAM/PRAM reset.\n\n\nIs there a fix?\n\nThis really depends on what's broken. It could be a defective GPU, but it could also just be a broken connector cable.\n\n*\n\n*iMacs from that decade are known to have GPU overheating issues (my Dad experienced this as well).\n\nTo analyze this further you would have to take the computer apart and/or take it into a repair shop. If you think you can detect hardware problems yourself, I suggest following this iFixit guide and open the MacBook yourself. For example, a broken cable could be detected by basically anyone, motherboard repairs are obviously for Pros, but in general possible.\n\nThe last two questions are so close, I am going to answer them as one:\n\nWorth it to repair/get a new one?\n\nThis very much depends on how much the repair would cost and how happy your wife is with this machine.\nBut as a general advice I would actually look into buying a new MacBook, since 8 years for laptop is not a bad age, especially for a low-speced MacBook Air 11\". Even the cheapest new MacBook Air from this fall will feel lightyears faster and actually seems to be a pretty good package as early reviews indicate.

If I open Preview while holding down shift it still tries to open all the documents that were open when it crashed, and consequently crashes again.\nI'm imagining the list of open documents is stored in a plist file somewhere, but there are currently no files in ~/Library/Application Support/Preview, so it's not there.

I am using an iPad 2 and I need Microsoft teams for classes. But it says that teams needs iOS 11 or later. I tried installing it from purchase history but it still doesn't work. Is there anything I can do?\n\nA: No. An application is (broadly) a list of instructions to the OS. Each new OS contains new instructions that applications can use.\nMS Teams requires instructions that are only found in iOS11 and later. Your OS doesn't recognise these.\nSome apps do keep older versions on the App Store for older OS/hardware to use: but I don't know the history of when Teams was ported to iOS.\nAn iPad2 is 9 years old. While you can always keep using the same software for as long as the hardware works (I'm surprised the battery's still going!), if you need newer software, then you have to have hardware that's closer in age.\n", "Q: 20 Watt charger harmful for the battery of a device? I'm considering to buy a 20 watt charger for my iOS-devices. Obviously it charges a device two to three times faster then the 5 watt chargers, which I currently use.\nI just wonder: Might it reduce the life-time of the battery? Or is it even dangerous (strong heating up, explosions)?\nShould I definitely get an original Apple charger? Or are others vendors safe too?\n\nA: A higher wattage charger will not harm the device, but it will also not charge a device any faster than a matched rating charger.\nThe power or current rating of a charger (or any power source) is its delivery capacity. The power or current rating of a device (or any load) is what it draws. No matter how much power or current a source can deliver, a load will only draw up to its own rating. Conversely an under-rated source will be insufficient for the load. In general, using an over-rated charger is a waste of money, but it won't cause harm.\nUSB is USB is USB, the brand doesn't matter, & any exception is equipment that differs is breaking USB spec. USB-C delivers 5 to 20 Volts (negotiated between source & load) at up to 5A. USB-A tops out at 3A & is 5V only. That's why USB-C can charge devices that support it faster.\nIf you have multiple iOS devices I suggest a better choice would be a multi port USB-C charger with ports of at least 5W capacity.\nP = V x I, where P is power in Watts, V is Voltage, & I is current in Amps (all 3 units are capitalised because they're people's names). So a 5W USB-C charger could be delivering 5V at 1A or 20V at 0.25A, as negotiated between the devices. A 20W USB-C charger could deliver 5V at 4A or 20V at 1A, as negotiated. A top rated USB-A charger will deliver 5V only at 3A = 15W, but many supply lower current for lower resultant power.\n\nA: 20W USB chargers are not dangerous to use with an iOS device. A non-defective USB charger coupled with a non-defective iOS-device will not overheat, explode, or reduce the life-time of the device.\nIt is perfectly valid and normal to use a 20W USB-charger with an iOS device.\nAny standards-compliant charger is fine. Apple chargers follow the same standards as chargers from other vendors.\nYou might want to stay away from the cheapest, no-brand chargers, as the quality is usually not that good.\nNote: A device won't necessarily charge faster with a higher capacity charger. Each type of device has a maximum wattage that they can draw from a charger - having a charger with a higher rating doesn't speed up anything.\nFor example an iPhone 12 can take advantage of the full 20W rating, where as an iPhone 7 only draws 10W.\n\nA: Buying a non apple charger is fine, as long as you take a reputable brand. Anker is known to be good for exemple.\nAvoid cheap Amazon or Aliexpress no name chargers at all cost!\nAs far as battery life is concerned, yes, it will have a small negative effect on battery life: Faster charge means more heat, which is known to have a small cumulative effect on battery life.\nI don't think it's particularly worth worrying about since the phones are designed to be charged this way.You could also mitigate this buy using 5W charging for night time, and 20W for quick day time top ups.\nDon't forget that your phone battery WILL degrade anyway, and that the battery can be exchanged (for a fee, or free under warranty)\n\nA: \nI'm considering to buy a 20 watt charger for my iOS-devices. Obviously it charges a device two to three times faster then the 5 watt chargers, which I currently use.\n\nI'm not sure about that, the BMS on the iOS device should alter its power draw to match what it's programmed to accept, given the current state of the battery.\nIf 5 W is the most it can charge at, then plugging it into a 20 W charger isn't going to force more than 5 W in.\nIf your device is capable of drawing more than your current charger provides then you'll see some improvements in charge time with a higher capacity charger but not necessarily by the ratio of how many watts the new charger provides vs the old one, ie. 20/5 = 4x faster. The BMS has to accept 20 W and even then things are a bit more nuanced as 20 W would be the maximum, not continual power draw.\n\nMight it reduce the life-time of the battery? Or is it even dangerous (strong heating up, explosions)?\n\nIt really shouldn't, unless there's an existing flaw in the battery or charger.\n\nShould I definitely get an original Apple charger? Or are others vendors safe too?\n\nI think that's going to be tough to get a definite answer for unless you have a teardown on the specific device, from someone qualified to comment on its quality. I've seen some teardowns of USB chargers with terrible isolation and there have been cases of people being shocked while using their phone as it's charging.\nI'd put money on there being plenty of properly made, safe chargers out there. The question I ask myself is: do I feel safe plugging a $1,000+ phone into this to save a few dollars, or is my peace of mind worth the ~$30 for an OEM part that I've seen a teardown confirm that at least the design is sound?\n\nA: The iPhone 12 has a 2815mAh battery. At a nominal voltage of 3.7V, this is 10.4Wh. Charging at 20W is equivalent to a C rate of 1.92 (20 / 10.4). Typically for maximum lifespan, Li-ion manufacturers generally recommend charging at < 0.8C for optimum battery lifespan. (The other answers are correct in that the BMS in the phone will not accept charge current in excess of the design spec, but 20W is now an allowed option, at least with an official 20W Apple charger).\nFor comparison, a Tesla Model Y has a 75kWh battery pack. The peak supercharger power is 150kW which is a C rate of 2 (150 / 75), so scaled for battery size, the 20W charger is roughly like supercharging your phone. It's pretty well accepted that while supercharging your Tesla is safe and not catastrophically destructive to your battery pack, it also isn't ideal for long-term battery health.\nWill your phone, or your Tesla explode? No, not unless something else is wrong. But is it ideal for your long-term battery capacity? No.\nMy recommendation is that if you need to charge fast, go for it. But if you're going to have your phone on the charger overnight anyway, why not use a slower charger in that location and save your battery a little stress?\n\nA: As several have explained, so called \"chargers\" are actually just charging power supplies; it is up to the charge controller inside the device to chose the appropriate charging rate, bounded of course by what the charging supply can provide.\nAs a result, the one argument why using a lower wattage external supply might be preferable, is if one felt that the on-boarding charging logic tended to prioritize convenience in the form of speed, over longevity.  If one believes that, then using a lower wattage source would constrain what the on-board charger controller could do; in effect you'd \"game\" it and force it to charge at a maximum rate of your preference, even if it were designed to \"think\" that a higher rate were permissible in a given case.\nRelated to this, and perhaps more meaningful, there are those who have rigged charging supplies to cut off when the device battery has reached some fraction of total specified charge short of completion.  There is some real reason to believe that the upper part of the charging curve (and storage at the upper part of the allowed state of charge) is more detrimental to long-term service life of lithium ion batteries than the middle part.  So if something like 70% charge would see a user through a given day, it's not a crazy idea.  At the same time, deep discharge isn't great either.  Someone going this route probably wants to carry a portable powerbank as backup.\n\nA: You know how a wall outlet works?  The outlet in the wall that is able to run a garage door opener, a vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, coffee pot, or toaster doesn't make your 15 watt LED lamp overheat and explode.  That outlet is able to supply 1800 watts but your little 20 watt cell phone charger isn't melting down.  That's because the wall outlet supplies a consistent voltage and the devices plugged in are made to draw no more power than they are designed to take.\nA USB power supply does the same thing, it supplies a consistent voltage and the phone is made to draw no more current than it needs.  There's an additional level of safety in that that every smart phone has a battery charge management system.  They monitor the battery temperature and voltage to make sure it doesn't explode.\nNow things happen and you will see people that blow up their phones.  Most of this is from improper battery replacements or severe damage to the phone.  Sometimes it is from a cheap charger or damaged charger.  Buy quality products and maintain them well and the chances of a phone exploding is small.\nBuy a quality charger of any wattage and the phone will be safe.  Apple has made improvements to their iOS battery management to improve battery life, one thing they did was to lower the rate of charge to the battery as it reaches full capacity.  They have the phone \"learn\" your routine and slow down charging when it thinks you are asleep.\nI have chargers from a number of vendors and they have all treated me and my phones well.  If you are concerned about quality of a high wattage charger then look for the USB \"trident\" symbol, UL and CE approval, USB-PD (indicating USB power delivery support), and other markings that indicate someone checked it over for safety.  There's no law against building a cheap power supply but it is illegal to use these markings without permission.  It's too expensive to fake these markings because the people that own them have a lot of money to chase violators down and take them to court.\n", "Q: Adding Environment Variables I can't understand the 3rd line in these instructions, found here\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dependency Ghostscript.

I'm concerned about updating to iOS 14 mainly because widgets have moved from their own screen onto the home screen. I get reminded of Windows 10 active tiles which just don't know when to stop moving.\nI use widgets often in iOS 13, but I really don't want to be distracted by them because they're...\n\n*\n\n*Animated\n\n*Not out of sight\n\nAre they animated? As in: are they allowed to animate in perpetuity?\nIs there a solution to #2 other than putting them on their own home screen page? If so, are they accessible from within apps as they are in iOS 13?\n\nA: I am using iOS 14 with widgets on the home screen, & I don't find them at all distracting.\nFirstly, widgets are only on the home screen if you put them there. If you don't they're all on the screen to the left of the home screen as in iOS 13.\nI have the Music, Photos, Calendar, & Weather widgets on my home screen, with all but Music as a stack. The closest to animation that I've seen is that sometimes the top widget of the stack changes as I wake my iPhone. Of course widgets do live update, so there would be a momentary animation when one updates. If those updates are frequent enough I imagine it could look like animation, but I can't imagine why a widget would be updating so much.\n", "Q: Changing character encoding from Unicode to Ascii I need to convert the character encoding in some text files created by a third-party app on my MBP Catalina 10.15.6.  I'm in unfamiliar waters here, so please indulge my ignorance.  Also, please note that the 3rd party app is not the subject of this question - understanding how to reconcile the different character sets used in macOS is the subject.\nI use an application (LTspice) on my MBP occasionally.  There is also a Windows version of LTspice.  LTspice provides a GUI for creating a circuit schematic, and LTspice creates a plain text file (.asc extension) to encode the schematic and other directives and parameters created in the LTspice GUI; this is the file I need to convert.\nI assumed the .asc files were not ASCII-encoded, and so I ran the file utility on the .asc file to learn how they were encoded:\n% file -I '/Users/seamus/Documents/LTspice/Rounding demo-MacMod.asc'\n/Users/seamus/Documents/LTspice/Rounding demo-MacMod.asc: application/octet-stream; charset=binary\n\nbinary?!...  This made no sense to me. I can open and edit this file in TextEdit.  All of the characters are recognizable ASCII characters - which I understand to be a subset of UTF-8.\nMy next step was to open the file in the BBedit app.  This revealed new information.  According to BBedit, the demo-MacMod.asc file reported by file -I as binary is actually: \"UTF-16 Little Endian\" format.  I know this is confusing... In an effort to clarify, I've placed a couple of screenshots below to illustrate how this file is rendered in BBedit and TextEdit.  The extra byte (¿) in the BBedit screenshot is a NUL.\nI need a method (that I can automate/script) to convert these \"UTF-16 Little Endian\" files to \"US-ASCII\". I thought that the iconv tool would be perfect for this job:\niconv -l\n...\n# long list of character encodings which included:\nUS-ASCII\nUCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE\n\nUCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE looked like the best match to \"UTF-16 Little Endian\", but:\n% iconv -f 'UCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE' -t 'US-ASCII' '/Users/seamus/Documents/LTspice/Rounding demo-MacMod.asc' > '/Users/seamus/Documents/LTspice/Rounding demo-MacMod-iconvASCII.asc'\niconv: conversion from UCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE unsupported\niconv: try 'iconv -l' to get the list of supported encodings\n\nI don't know why I get this response. Clearly iconv -l says that UCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE is supported. Whether it's the correct match for \"UTF-16 Little Endian\" is another question, but I find nothing in the list that looks to be a better match.\nSo this is the gist of my question. I think it could be answered in one of two ways:\n\n*\n\n*What is my error in the use of iconv, or in my reading of man iconv or iconv -l?\n\n\n*Is there another option for converting \"UTF-16 Little Endian\" to \"US-ASCII\" that can be automated/scripted?\nSCREENSHOTS:\nin TextEdit:\n\nin BBedit:\n\n\nA: With BBEdit this is easy. First open the file in BBEdit. If you let BBEdit install its command line tool you can even do this from Terminal with bbedit /path/to/filename. If the file has opened as the wrong encoding, select File > Reopen Using Encoding > correct encoding. I think it would be worth trying reopening using UTF-16 Little-Endian & UTF-16 Little-Endian, no BOM to see if either of those has the file open as desired. When you have the file correctly opened, select File > Save As.... In the Save As dialog box you can choose the desired encoding, & also the line ending type if that matters.\nFor dealing with inverted red question marks, probably null (ASCII 0), select Text > Zap Gremlins... for the dialog below...\n\nUsing the options shown there should give a state like what you see in TextEdit. Try different options on copies of a couple of your files.\nBecause BBEdit has a command line tool, you should be able script it once you have the correct options. BBEdit also works with AppleScript & Automator.\nYou can download BBEdit for free from the link I've given. It will start in demo mode, & when the demo mode expires it will continue to run in free mode where the features you need are still available.\n\nA: \n\n*\n\n*What is my error in the use of iconv, or in my reading of man iconv or iconv -l?\n\n\nThe error was simply mis-reading the output of iconv -l:\niconv -l\n...\n# long list of character encodings which included:\nUS-ASCII\nUCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE\n\nThe character encoding is correctly read as UCS-2LE - not UCS-2LE UNICODELITTLE.

It will not require receiving a text message or voice call.\nThis works using a similar technique as app based authenticators like the Google Authenticator app and the Microsoft Authenticator app, namely that a secret is stored on your device and that enables you to generate 2-factor codes on this particular device. It does not however follow the TOTP standard like those two authenticator apps.\nOnly when that secret is lost (for example by wiping your hard drive), and you haven't got access to any other device that can generate the 2-factor code for you - you'll need to request a new confirmation code by text or voice.\nIf you want to guard against that (rare) situation, you can definitely use a Google Voice number to receive the voice delivered code.\n\nA: You can use any mobile phone for an AppleID that requests two-factor. You don’t have all the extra bells and whistles, but it will work just fine.\nI have two AppleID that need this and I can’t have both work via iCloud only on my single iPhone.

I have a WD Passport external hard drive with ethernet and Firewire 800 ports only.  Having just purchased a new MacBook Pro (2019), I'd like to continue using this drive as my backup.  As ethernet is faster than FW800, I want to connect using the ethernet port, however it seems that I have to buy both a TB3 to ethernet adapter and a separate ethernet cable of some length.  (Actually, I may need a TB3 to TB2 dongle + a TB2 to ethernet dongle + the ethernet cable).  I'm looking for the simplest solution hopefully without a 6ft. ethernet cable coiled on my desk.\nIs there not a single male to male adapter cable that can accomplish this connection?\nI would appreciate any suggestions.\nThanks!\n\nA: I doubt that such an adapter exists.\nYou can get TB3 to Ethernet dongles from many different companies - there's no need to buy a TB2 dongle and TB2 ethernet adapter.\nYou can also get very short ethernet cables. There's no need for a 6ft ethernet cable - you can get a 1ft one (or even shorter). They're available at a low price (few dollars).\nRemember to take a close look at the specs of your drive before purchasing adapters (you did not include any identifying information). There's a good chance that the FW800 port is actually going to be faster in practice than connecting over Ethernet.\nAlso if the drive is already several years old (which I gather it is, as I do not think any current Passport product has the FW800/Ethernet combo) - then it is might be more economical to buy a new drive with USB-C. Remember that old drives will fail at some point.\n\nA: Even if this exists, you don’t want it. Thunderbolt 3 can run this gigabit Ethernet adapter cheaper on USB-C 3.x and faster than the network can handle.\n\n*\n\n*Belkin USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter\n\n*Any reliable CAT-5e or better ethernet patch cable of the length you prefer.\n\nNow, I’m skeptical your ethernet controller is actually faster in practice than FireWire 800 but the power efficiencies are better and cabling and parts are much cheaper if you tunnel the storage traffic of point to point ethernet. You’ll want faster ethernet on both ends and a modern storage controller to get faster response than FireWire 800 which was ridiculously fast for it’s time.

I tried resetting my iPhone 8 by selecting \"Erase All Content and Settings\", but for some reason, when I check my storage after, \"Other\" is taking up 50GB??? I haven't even backed up any new/old data into the phone, so it should have been in a clean slate. For some reason, \"Other\" is still taking up 50GB. What's going on?\n\nA: Try resetting the phone.\nBack it up first using iTunes (or the Finder on macOS Catalina.) And don't forget to give the backup a password so it saves your passwords.\nThen go into Settings > General > Reset and erase all content and settings.\nThis will reset it to factory defaults and delete the caches and temporary files or whatever else is taking up that space.\nThen restore the backup you just made and most, if not all, of that \"other\" storage being taken up should be reduced substantially.\nIf not you may want to look at Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see if you have a particular app that is holding on to a lot of storage space.\n\nA: On rare occasion, erase all content and settings will free this, but most of the time you want to restore it from Finder on a Mac or iTunes on Windows.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252\nThe why is space from apps that should be deleted either is stuck or there is file system corruption or snapshots that aren’t cleaning. Normally, this is a small portion of storage and letting the device run, shutting it down once a day for three days cleans things up well. When that is not effective, restore it to factory default - do not sign in to iCloud or restore a backup and then report the space with nothing on the phone.\n", "Q: How can I make unlocking my Mac with my Apple Watch more secure? I have turned on the feature to allow my Mac to be unlocked via my Apple Watch. However, there is no interaction required from me - if I am home and asleep with my watch on, my roommate can go to my computer and it will unlock. I'd prefer if I had to tap something on my watch to allow it. This is how 1Password works - it prompts me on my watch and I have to accept\n\nA: I think that you should approach situation in more generalized way.\nI don't think that requirement to interact with watch will improve your security. Why? If your roommate have access to your computer and to you while you are sleeping there is nothing that stops him/her interacting with your watch.\nPossible solutions as I see it (in no particular order): change roommate, take off watch while sleeping, disable unlocking with watch.\nBut keep in mind that if you have fingerprint access on your notebook and it's enabled it should be relatively easy to press your finger on sensor without waking you up. So you may consider turning it off as well.\nIf your computer is off then in order to unlock with watch or with fingerprint to work you should first log in with password. So if you go to sleep with computer off neither of these options work without password.\n\nA: Before bed, engage the passcode on the watch by taking it off your wrist long enough for proximity to break and then put it back on.

There is a ~1 second delay every time I input my password to unlock the Mac, regardless if it is correct or not. I'd like to turn this off, or at least reduce it. How can I do this?\n\nA: This sounds like normal behavior to me, especially if the machine is a bit older.\nAs far as I know, there is no setting you can change to speed this up.\n\nI can confirm that on a solid 2017 15\" MBP there is a ~0.5 seconds \"wait\" time after hitting enter and the screen unlocking. But this not only varies from machine to machine, but especially from the programs that are running and if you have multiple monitors connected.\n\nWhat you could try, but IMO is not worth it, make a clean install (preferably on an external SSD) with just one sample user with no other programs installed and check if you still have the delay.\n\n*\n\n*If the answer is yes, then it's definitely normal behavior\n\n*If the answer is no, you might want to look into programs that are continuously running in the background, which could impact general performance.\n\nIn general though, I suspect investigating this (IMO) non-issue will take you more time than \"waiting\" one second every unlock.\n", "Q: Why can I no longer reply from Messages notifications in macOS Big Sur?

From time to time, I want to unplug my iMac from power in order to move it, but I also want it to restore the state back to where it was. I learned that I could enable a hibernation mode, which would save the contents of RAM to SSD before sleep:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n\nNow, when I tell it to sleep, I can hear the fans turning off after 10 seconds. But when I wake it up, the screen turns on instantly, as if no sleep was happening. This is clearly wrong, because the documentation says the memory should be powered off:\nhibernatemode = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a\ncopy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to\nmemory. The system will restore from disk image.

I used HardwareGrowler for years to get notified about hardware and system events on my Macs.\nHardwareGrowler was initially provided as an extra with Growl, and was then proposed as a standalone app in the Mac App Store.\nThe Growl developper recently announced Growl's retirement (see also ArsTechnica's recent post).\nI won't miss Growl, given that I haven't used it for year.

I would still like to understand why.\nORIGINAL POST\nAfter upgrading to Big Sur from Catalina, I tried to use the terminal to rename some files in a subfolder of my Home folder. I had created and used the subfolder before upgrading. Specifically, I tried renaming a group of Rdat files using a bash for loop. I could do this under Catalina, but now I get an error. Here, I am trying to replace 'PCC-' in each file name with an empty string (i.e. ''):\nfor f in *.Rdat; do mv $f ${f/PCC-//}; done\n\nThis yields an error for every file, like this (for file PCC-ASR-H.Rdat):\nmv: /ASR-H.Rdat: Read-only file system\n\nThis seems strange because as owner of the folder I have write permissions:\ndrwxr-xr-x    8 mike  staff   256 Nov 21 15:04 Rdatafiles\n\nAnd I have write permissions for the files in the folder (example):\n-rw-rw-r--@ 1 mike  staff  10926 Dec  4 18:26 PCC-ASR-H.Rdat\n\nI tried disabling SIP in Recovery Mode:\ncsrutil disable\n\nBut the problem remains. Is it possible to make subfolders of the home folder writeable under Big Sur? Are there some additional changes I need to make to the system (i.e. permissions) to enable write access? Or do I now need to move my work files out of Home and into, say, Home/Documents, to avoid this issue?\n\nA: The problem is the double forward-slash in ${f/PCC-//}. Unlike a sed substitution pattern, there's no / at the end of the replacement pattern (it's terminated by }), so the extra / is taken as the replacement string. This turns e.g. \"PCC-ASR-L.Rdat\" into \"/ASR-L.Rdat\", which (because of the \"/\") is at the root of the filesystem... which is read-only.\nWhen I'm doing things like batch renames, I also often don't get everything right on the first try, so I tend to do a dry run with echo in front of the mv (or cp or rm or...) command first, so I can see what's going to happen before actually running it. I also strongly recommend using mv -i or mv -f, so if there's any sort of naming conflict it won't just silently and irreversibly overwrite files. Also, putting double-quotes around variable references is a good idea, in case any filenames contain weird characters.\nSo my dry run would look something like this:\nfor f in *.Rdat; do echo mv -i \"$f\" \"${f/PCC-/}\"; done\n\n...and if that looked right, I'd hit up-arrow to get it back, delete the \"echo\", and re-run it for real.\nIf you need to troubleshoot in even more detail, using set -x before the command will show what the shell thinks is going on (i.e. what the command looks like after substitutions are performed) in cases like this.\n", "Q: Failure to reconnect to networks on iOS Since installing iOS 14.0 (now 14.2) my iPhone XS repeatedly fails to reconnect to my network after returning from being out of range (e.g., on a walk) and frequently loses the network connection after periods of inactivity (e.g. overnight).

Configurations I added:\n\n*\n\n*Created the file untitled.sh on my Desktop (which has #!/bin/bash in the beginning of the file).\n\n*Ran 'chmod +x untitled.sh'.\n\n*Using crontab -e, added the cron 0 13 * * * /Users/michael/Desktop/untitled.sh.\n\n*In Security & Privacy > Privacy, gave Full Disk Permissions to iTerm, Terminal, bash & cron.\n\nbut I still get the error:\n/bin/bash: /Users/michael/Desktop/untitled.sh: Operation not permitted\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nA: Posting here a partial answer to the question, from the comment section (courtesy to nohillside and scottmeup).\nSeems the problem is related to the Extended Attribute com.apple.macl that was automatically assigned to the bash file on creation (discovered by running ls -la FILE_NAME, and the xattr itself from xattr FILE_NAME). This xattr was in fact attached to any file I created on the Desktop, Not sure why; I didn't manage to easily remove it by using xattr -d.\nWhen I created the file in e.g. $HOME, it didn't have this xattr, and did run in the cron without any additional action. After moving the file from $HOME to Desktop, the cron worked as well.\n", "Q: Can you Manually copy User Folder to new Mac? I've had an issue with an old Mac where I can no longer boot into it. I plugged the drive into another computer and I can access my user folder.\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to restore this whole user account on a new Mac?\n\n*Could I just paste it in the Users folder in the new mac?\n\n*Is there a way to create a time machine backup of that\nuser folder which I can then restore from?\n\n\nA: If the drive is fine and only the old Mac broken, then you have several options. These are the steps I would recommend:\n\n*\n\n*With the drive attached to your new Mac, open disk utility, hit view and select show all devices. Then choose the parent volume of the drive and click first aid. Do the same with its volumes. If an error occurs try again multiple times and/or in Recovery Mode.\n\n*Try simply booting from this drive. Shut down the Mac. Disconnect everything, then only reconnect the old system drive. Start your Mac and hold the opt. If the boot loader detects your old system drive to be bootable it show up and you can select it to boot from that drive. You can then do a TM-Backup or even continue using it that way if you want.\n\n*As already suggested by @nohillside you can also try using Migration Assistant.\n\n*If you want to completely control what files will be on your new Mac, then I suggest only copying specific files from your old drive to the new Mac (e.g. only the Home folder and no Apps).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To restore your user account I would recommend creating a TM backup, since this will also restore settings and all programs for that user account.\n\n*If you only want to restore the data of your user account, it is\nperfectly fine to just copy the contents of the Home folder (e.g. the\nMovies folder).\n\n", "Q: Upgraded to Big Sur, and now screen sharing doesn't work even though I granted app permissions I recently upgraded to the Big Sur OS.

Recently, Apple logged me out of my Apple ID and made me go through a new procedure where I used my recovery key, and was asked to provide my machine login info, and my iPhone unlock code to be able to access my account. (I was also told that recovery keys were no longer usable, unless I changed setting to enable them, though it's not clear how.)\nIs this part of a new Apple security policy? Does Apple now have my machine login info; my iPhone unlock code?\n\nA: This isn't new. While I can't speak to the exact moment this was added, you can rest assured knowing that your passcode/password is safe. What Apple is doing here is verifying your identity by taking advantage of the fact that you use iCloud Keychain. iCloud Keychain escrow is a fairly complicated procedure, but in essence Apple never sees your passcode, it can only see that their hardware modules granted you access to your escrowed bag which proves that you know the passcode to your devices. It's a really neat solution for account verification!\nFor more info, see page 86 of the Apple platform security whitepaper.\n", "Q: internet sharing (mojave) AND two-way connection I apologize for any confusion bc of the subject line. Explanation:\nI am sharing a wireless connection on a Mojave MBP 2012 (ethernet/thunderbolt/USB) with a PC running Win10. The PC is able to surf, so internet sharing is nominally working. Is there a way to also go in reverse? What I mean is, I want to use the same network to connect from the MBP to the PC, for example using Remote Desktop.\nMy hardware is configured as follows:\nwireless router <---> MBP <---> eth <--->|        |<---> eth <---> PC\n                                         8-port hub\n\nFor separate reasons, I'm not using the default internet sharing settings:\nicu-mojave:~ $ ifconfig bridge100\nbridge100: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=3<RXCSUM,TXCSUM>\n    ether aa:20:66:b1:68:64 \n    inet 192.168.22.10 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.22.255\n    inet6 fe80::a820:66ff:feb1:6864%bridge100 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xe \n    Configuration:\n        id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0\n        maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200\n        root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0\n        ipfilter disabled flags 0x2\n    member: en0 flags=3<LEARNING,DISCOVER>\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 7 priority 0 path cost 0\n    Address cache:\n        84:2b:2b:a5:11:63 Vlan1 en0 1199 flags=0<>\n        dc:a6:32:96:3f:b8 Vlan1 en0 1192 flags=0<>\n        84:2b:2b:a5:11:10 Vlan1 en0 1187 flags=0<>\n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\n\nMy ethernet interface looks like this:\n\nAs I mentioned, this \"works.\" The PC is surfing the internet etc - it is set up to get an address conventionally (DHCP) and has the IP 192.168.22.11.\nProblem: from the MBP, I can't ping 192.168.22.11. I get a request timeout (as opposed to host down for example). I figure if I can't ping it, I can't do anything else either. For starters, I'd like to connect to the PC using Remote Desktop from the MBP so I can get rid of the extra monitor and keyboard.\nOK that's it – is this quest even possible perhaps with a change to bootp settings, or do I need to replace the hub with a router and create a 2nd downstream network? I've read that Apple's NAT doesn't do \"true bridging,\" but I can't evaluate that comment or whether that's the issue even.\n\nA: Answering my own question for the record if anyone else searches. FYI I had to go to a full router setup to get this to work. The new configuration is:\nwireless router <---> MBP <---> eth <--->|    |<---> eth <---> PC\n                                         router\n\nThe MBP side of the router is the \"internet\" connection and the other side is the 4-port hub provided by the router for its private local network. Had to set up port forwarding on the router to target individual PCs via RDP, and there are Raspberry Pis on the hub side as well, but all is functional.\nI still think I'm lacking something because \"internet sharing\" is inherently 2-way on some level, but I don't know enough about Apple's implementation of this sharing to know what's missing.\n", "Q: 3/4 Icon in the status bar.

The RAW images were shot without corresponding JPGs, ie the CR2 and DNG images are the only copy.\nAre CR2/DNG unsupported by iCloud, or is there something wrong with my setup?\n\nA: I think it's working, I think it's still uploading them but the progress bar in Photos.app is missing. I looked at the total number of items visible at https://www.icloud.com/photos and the number is gradually going up. They're slower to appear on iPhone but I do see some RAW photos there, based on a random check.\nThe progress bar is now working and the \"Uploading 445 items\" counter is slowly going up instead of down, so it looks like it's slow to decide what it needs to upload. There's now only 6324 large RAW files left to upload.\n", "Q: iOS backup to iCloud: how private? My understanding is that most data uploaded to iCloud from an iPhone is encrypted on some server and that apple possesses the decryption key to this data. For example, files from the Files app can be stored in iCloud Drive, which can then be decrypted by Apple. But what about the generic iPhone backup that essentially stores a clone of the device in the cloud? Can Apple simply decrypt and view the full contents of your device when you back it up to iCloud?\n\nA: Quoth Apple:\n\niCloud secures your information by encrypting it when it's in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication. For certain sensitive information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption. This means that only you can access your information, and only on devices where you’re signed into iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information.\n\n\nIn some cases, your iCloud data may be stored using third-party partners’ servers—such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform—but these partners don’t have the keys to decrypt your data stored on their servers.\n\n\nEnd-to-end encryption requires that you have two-factor authentication turned on for your Apple ID. Keeping your software up-to-date and using two-factor authentication are the most important things that you can do to maintain the security of your devices and data.\n\nAccording to the chart in the link below, all iCloud services are encrypted in transit, and all but iCloud.com and Mail are encrypted on the server.\nTwo-factor authentication is required for end-to-end encryption.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303\n", "Q: Show videos, animations or text in Mac's touchbar Given that the mac's touchbar is an actual display would it be possible to do things like display arbitrary text, a video or an animation in the touchbar?\nFor example, what would it take to display a text file, an animated png/gif or mp4 in the touchbar?\nIs there an API that allows doing it and/or are there apps that implement the API and provide a UI to do it?\nIdeally I would like to see the API exposed via AppleScript so that one could do something like\n-- pseudo-code\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    display touchbar text 'hello touchbar'\nend tell\n\n\nA: This little snippet from Developer HIG indicates that animations are possible in the Touch Bar:\n\nAvoid animation.

Earlier AirPods and AirPods Pro models send audio over 256kbps AAC.\nAs I use Tidal HiFi (lossless streaming) and some offline flac/wav files, I still need to use wired headphones, and I need to get 3-4 lightning to 3.5mm jack adapters each year, as they go off often.\nI'm thinking about buying the AirPods Max, but I won't buy it if it's still limited to the same 256kbps AAC recompression as the earlier AirPods.\nIt seems it uses Bluetooth 5.0 which by itself supports up to 2Mbps, also it may have it's own wireless chip again, so I see the chance, but I'm awaiting confirmation as Apple's marketing page didn't convince me if it's supported or not: https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-max/\nQuestion:\nDoes someone know if AirPods Max support lossless audio over wireless?\n\nA: It does not. Apple's current implementation of the bluetooth 5.0 specification does not allow for support of any lossless codec. And in any case the real world  performance of the bluetooth chipset can not sustain 2 Mbps beyond very short ranges so you may as well use a long cable to connect it.\n\nA: There isn't any such thing as lossless Bluetooth for audio... Even Sony's LDAC is 900 Kbps. I'm listening to a 11.2 Mbps DSD Pink Floyd album as I type this on my Audeze wired headphones. With LDAC bluetooth, I'd lose 92% of the quality.\n\nA: Misconceptions\n256 kbps AAC files are compressed by transcoding causing further information loss to AirPods when streaming from an Apple Device.\nThe Reality\nThere is no 256 kbps AAC compression to AirPods.\nSome insights\nThe idea can easily be called \"lossless\" audio because AAC audio files are not transcoded and then decoded by various Bluetooth specifications; they are simply transmitted and decoded without the transcode step.\nWhat lossless means in this sense is that the AAC file is delivered bit-for-bit to your AirPods. Any other format will first need to be transcoded on the fly to be shrunk down to the bandwidth limitations of arbitrary audio formats like mp3.\nCharts and references\nYou can see this in how bitrates are transcoded to constant or have encode-decode lag in transmission:\n\nTranscoding a 256 kbps AAC file to a higher kbps file will cause even more information to be lost as transcoding is a lossy compression technique.\nFor AAC, again, there is no encoding performed on the original audio, and thus the only decoding done is of the original audio stream.\nMore data dispelling false idea that AAC is transcoding from Apple device to Apple BT devices2:\n\nSee also\nAbout lossless audio in Apple Music\n\nWhile the difference between AAC and lossless audio is virtually indistinguishable, we’re offering Apple Music subscribers the option to access music in lossless audio compression.\n\n\nAirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and Beats wireless headphones use Apple AAC Bluetooth Codec to ensure excellent audio quality.

How can I run binaries on a M1 based Mac in the Terminal that is not natively built for Arm?\n\nA: When macOS tries to run an app that is not built for Apple silicon, macOS will prompt to install Rosetta 2 to automatically translate the app to Apple silicon.\nIn Terminal, there is no automatic detection for missing Rosetta to run older architecture command line tools.\nIf you haven't been prompted for any other app already, manually install Rosetta 2:\nsoftwareupdate --install-rosetta\n\nIf you need to run a universal binary in the previous architecture, use arch and specify the architecture.

This way will Terminal and every binary it tries to run through Rosetta, so Apple silicon binaries won't be supported and performance will be impacted, but you don't need to specify the architecture to run old binaries.\nTo switch an existing zsh terminal to x86_64 use this command:\narch -x86_64 zsh\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a new Terminal session.\n\n*Remove /usr/local/bin from PATH for this session by PATH=${PATH/\\/usr\\/local\\/bin:}\n\n*Run which git curl in this session.\n\n*Confirm that you get no errors and neither path reported begins with /usr/local/bin\n\n*Run the installer in this session.\n\nSource: https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/1379#discussioncomment-672727\n", "Q: Voice control custom command with variable? I'd like to be able to declaim \"Keyword foo\" and have voice control, on hearing this, type :foo for me.\nMany of the built-in commands take 'parameters' (i.e., some following speech), so if it were possible to make a user defined command as such it would look like keyword <phrase>, i.e., a 'variable' goes into the command (that variable being \"phrase\").\nIs there a way to make a user-defined command which takes a variable as input, as many of the built-in commands do?

My MacBook Pro 15, mid 2015, has bad distortion on the right speaker. Headphones and bluetooth are fine, and when I use the Audio MIDI utility to swap channels it stays on the right speaker. I installed another right speaker I bought online, but the problem persists. Neither speaker had a broken cone, and the distortion sounds more electronic anyway.\nEither:\n\n*\n\n*I got a replacement speaker with the same problem. Since it was used, this is possible but seems unlikely given that my searches online don't suggest that this is a common problem.\n\n*I somehow managed to get the old one I removed mixed up with the new one, and put the old one back in. Possible as I'm a old fart, but I labeled the old one as \"bad\" to avoid this, and the one in my junk box is labeled \"bad\". Tho still possible that it was the labeling where I spaced out, but would require me to have been even more of a screw up than I usually am.\n\n*There is some sort of preamp on the sound/mother/other board that has blown.\n\n*There is some sort of software issue that is overdriving some amp somewhere.\n\nI can solve #2 by doing the swap again, but it required more futzing inside the case than I like to do, always worried my fat fingers are going to break something else when I have to go that deep. Maybe it's possible to just plug the bad-labeled speaker in to test it, but I hate actually booting the thing with the back off.\nIt was pretty cheap, tho I don't recall where I got it, so if I could eliminate #2, #3, and 4, I'll just buy a new one.\nCan any of you help me eliminate #3 and #4?\n\nA: I impatiently decided to check the other speaker and managed to bust the plug (Doh!) trying to pull it off so I could test the \"bad\" one. That left me having to actually install the \"bad\" one anyway, which I did, and lo and behold, it seems to be working.\nLooks like I was indeed more of a screw up than usual, in that I somehow managed to label the new one \"bad.\"\nSo anyway, never mind.\n", "Q: How to toggle dark mode on and invert colors using Automator I am using Automator for the first time and I wonder if it possible to create a quick action to toggle dark mode on and invert colors using a shortcut.\n\nA: I don't know about invert colors, but to quickly toggle Dark/Light Mode, In Automator:\n\n*\n\n*Make a new Application document:\n\n\n\n\n*Simply add the chunk for Change System Appearance > Toggle Light/Dark:\n\n\n\n\n*Save and name the application somewhere you can easily activate it, such as the Desktop so you can double-click it to toggle Dark Mode.

I would like to participate.\nThe primary problem is that when I send messages from Message+, the messages that I send do not show up as text messages in the iPhone iMessage version of the conversation.  So I can only see what I text from the Message+ app.\nEveryone else can see my messages in both places.  I cannot find anything in the iPhone settings to change this.\n[This problem makes no sense... why would the app not sync my own messages with my own phone, when it shows it to everyone else, even though some people don't have iPhones (some are on android)? ] (Original)\nEdited: Everyone else can see their own texts in both apps, but I cannot.  There must be some setting to toggle this, but I cannot find it in either app's settings.  None of my friends toggled any settings from default, nor did I.  Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Ask Verizon why their app does not have some feature you think it should have.\nRe why you think it's strange that the recipient sees the message in both apps... what else did you expect to happen?  Verizon's Message+ does not implement a different communication channel, it's a received SMS.

After enabling COVID exposure notifications on my iPhone, I was not prompted to enable Bluetooth which was turned off in the control center at the time. I thought Bluetooth need to be on for this service to work.\nIf I turn off Bluetooth, will this service stop working?\niPhone 11\niOS 14.2\nThis is about the new exposure notification service that does not require a separate app to work (like it did previously). These are the \"exposure notifications\" built into iOS that were not available prior to iOS 14.\n\nA: I would go back to basics. How are you disabling Bluetooth? The radio is active for system services in almost all cases and I would expect enabling COVID 19 exposure notifications implies that each device hardware listens and broadcasts on a separate hardware channel than any other Bluetooth emanation or pairing.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/ios-11s-misleading-ish-setting-bluetooth-and-wi-fi-bad-user-security\n\n*https://covid19-static.cdn-apple.com/applications/covid19/current/static/contact-tracing/pdf/ExposureNotification-BluetoothSpecificationv1.2.pdf\nBoth Google and Apple have the same design document up and someone with a Bluetooth sniffer could validate this as well.\n\nA: Yes, exposure tracking requires Bluetooth. See, for example, the description of the Califonia effort now leaving beta, at California Covid tracking.\nNow, why the phone didn't prompt you to enable Bluetooth, I couldn't say.  Do you have your state's tracking app installed?

Is there any instance of cellular support for the Apple Watch enabled with a pre-paid phone plan?\nI wonder if this is a contractual restraint, rather than a technical constraint.\n\nA: There is no technical constraint preventing an Apple Watch cellular from being used with a pre-paid plan.\nI have used an Apple Watch Cellular with pre-paid plan in India.\n", "Q: Why iphone 6s frequently restarts?

Google's speed test (just for one quick and easy metric) frequently dips down to about 1 Mbps for downloads. A separate laptop on the same network at the same time, but through WiFi, will consistently show 250 Mbps.\nSometimes connecting the iMac to WiFi seems to improve speeds a bit. Sometimes they improve on their own. In any case the iMac never sees more than half the speeds a laptop does.\nThis is a new problem immediately after upgrading to Big Sur (i.e., no other changes to the system or network). I'm therefore assuming this is something to do with macOS. But I am at a loss to even begin to know how to troubleshoot the problem.\nWhat in macOS can I check or tweak or investigate to get any handle on what's even happening, much less how to fix it?\n\nA: The culprit here is the Cisco AnyConnect client. Apparently Cisco changed the way AnyConnect works for Big Sur (to get away from kernel extensions), and the new approach adds three \"filters\" that are visible in the Network panel.\nThe main filter shows as \"connected\" even when AnyConnect itself is not actually connected and indeed when the application isn't even running.\nRemoving the filters outright immediately restores network speeds back to normal. It also (unsurprisingly) breaks AnyConnect, which then tries to re-add the filters the next time it's run. That's going to be a problem for Future Me to solve.\n", "Q: Chrome's location setting constantly disabled Whenever I open Google Chrome (including Chromium and Canary) on my Mac the location is set to off.

I use macOS 11.0.1 (updated to 11.2 now) and found this is true on multiple macs.\n\nUPDATE\nI found out that this problem happens on all Chrome variants. Also, this even happened while I'm running the app.\n\nA: Not a solution, but perhaps a path to one....\nMany people (including me) have this problem.\nIn another forum, a user (Sizmo_68) inspired me to wonder:\nWhat if the abhorrent security preferences in macOS are remembering the version number (or similar) of each app that has location (or other preferences) enabled?  Then, when the app gets updated...poof, new version, and ... it no longer matches what's in the security database, so: no longer enabled.\nIf that's the case, we're out of luck until Apple admits the problem and fixes it.\nAs one other user pointed out, it's clearly a macOS problem (not a Chrome problem), because by implementation apps can't change the security preferences :)\n\nA: This is tracked here (I think.) Sounds like it's fixed and hopefully will be corrected in a coming chrome version.\n", "Q: Why are some SMS-recipients reachable through iOS but not macOS? I can launch the Messages app on Catalina and send an SMS to anyone on my iCloud or Gmail contact lists, which gives me the convenience of touch typing replies, as well as seeing attachments on a large screen—except for one contact.\nThis one contact, with whom I communicate often, uses an Android mobile phone. I had understood that so long as I am using a recent enough iOS version (it's 14.1) and a recent enough macOS (10.15.7), and am logged into both using the same Apple ID, I should be able to message anyone on my contacts list using the Mac's keyboard, regardless of the mobile OS of the person on the other side, indeed even if the other person uses only a very basic phone device.\nWhen I enter this recipient's name in Messages, I only get a few older messages. When I receive messages from this one individual, I can only see them on iOS, not through macOS.\nWhy are some message-recipients reachable through iOS but not macOS?\nIn case it matters, this one contact used to use an iPhone, but moved to Android. Yet even when using iOS, I was receiving \"green\", not \"blue\", message bubbles, signaling that the messages are sent/received through the phone company's networks, not through iCloud.\n\nA: *\n\n*On your computer, open the person’s contact card in Contacts/Address Book\n\n*Verify that the phone number you are attempting to use is classified as something other than “iPhone” (e.g. “Work” or “Mobile”)\n\n*Ensure you don’t have multiple contact cards for the same person, and create one for them if one doesn’t currently exist\n\nIf that doesn’t work, it might be worth trying to sign-out and back in to iCloud on both your computer and your iPhone, after re-booting both devices first.\n(As for the messages when they were previously using an iPhone, the may have had “send all messages as SMS” enabled, or they didn’t a reliable mobile data connection while messaging you.)\n", "Q: Mac OS Big Sur - mouse stutter (not a Bluetooth problem) I'm experiencing really annoying mouse stutter on my MacBook Pro 16 inch. When I move the cursor it's smooth for a few seconds and then it suddenly stops for a split-second before moving again. This stutter/lag is there all the time.\nIt started about a week ago and it doesn't stop. I restarted the computer, reset everything that is to reset on a Mac (except reinstalling the os) and it still persists.\nI googled that problem and almost all posts I found relate this to the Bluetooth connection. That's not the case for me because the stutter is also there when I use the built-in trackpad.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: My laggy mouse seemed to be related to my USB3.0 external hard drive. This is explained in this blog post. I ejected the drive and unplugged it, which seemed to make the lagging go away.\n\nI am using:\n\n*\n\n*Logitech MX Anywhere Mouse 2S\n\n*MX Keys Mac\n\n*MacBook Pro Intel Core i9 on OS Big Sur 11.6\n\nI am also using a USB C DisplayPort External Monitor, but the problem seemed to be the external hard drive, not the USB C monitor.\n\nA: I have this problem for sometimes. Really annoying, especially when working on photoshop. I have external monitor attached. And using my Macbook Pro 16 in Clamshell mode.\n\n*\n\n*Use USB docking (baseus 16 in 1 dock)\n\n*Using Pen Tablet using USB\n\n*Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard\n\n*Logitech Bluetooth MX Anywhere Mouse\n\n*2 external hard disk connected\n\n*Using USB-C to DisplayPort Connector for External Monitor\n\nI tried the mouse using Bluetooth and also the Dongle come with the Logitech mouse. Both of this method show stutter. With the dongle stutter is worse.\nThis happens for sometimes, change to Wired mouse the problem was gone.\nBut I am still trying to make my Logitech Bluetooth works as I like the mouse a lot.\nDid many things in many forum discussing this problem.\nThen stumbled in just one discussion forum. And install this software called Smooze (https://smooze.co/). 7 days trial, so might try if this is works or not.\nMagically after using this software, all the stutter using Bluetooth Mouse is gone. I didn't know what was going on, but the stutter issue just gone.\n\nSo maybe just might give this small program i try.\nI am not related to Smooze in anyway :)\nThanks\n\nA: So the solution for me was to unplug the hdmi monitor cable from my vava dock, once I did that the mouse became smooth again. I didn't need the hdmi connection because I use a usb-c to display port adapter for the mac. The hdmi cable in the dock was for my pc laptop. It's probably not a good idea to have 2 separate display cables feeding into the same monitor from one machine anyway.\n\nA: This model is buggy for me too when I had at least six devices in the four USB-C/TB Ports: I had a question yesterday, and then started ranting: Shutdown Cause -128 on MacBook Pro: Should I replace the charger with exposed wire?\nI just think the MacBook isn't getting the power it needs with the default 96 W charger, so I asked for a deal, and got shot down. They sent me a new one tomorrow.\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\nI'm getting the higher wattage one and selling this if the problem continues. It was shorting out my LAN of all things (Hub has one more change)!\nLook in System Information under power it tells you the current you're machine is getting.\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/iOgEr.png\n\nA: I've never used any Bluetooth mice or trackpads, I only had a Bluetooth speaker. Anyway, resetting bluetooth daemon using the command below did the trick: the stutter is gone!\nsudo pkill bluetoothd\n\nP.S.: I'm using built-in trackpad.\nP.P.S.: UPDATE: I have finally found the certain source of the problem. And it is related to Bluetooth. The real cause of the problem is Handoff feature. Disabling Handoff between your iCloud devices in your system settings makes stutter disappear.\n\nA: I was having the same issue. Problem was being caused by using a secondary monitor that was connected to the USB3.1 slot of my iMac. (Display-to-USB3.1) For me the problem was solved after reconnecting/changing it to a different USB slot. I also can confirm it has nothing to do with the mouse since i was experiencing the same issue with a WacomPenTablet.\nSo it definitely has something to do with USB ports and Displays.\nI Hope this helps.\n\nA: Apple has some good content to explain the general concept of a hitch, which is when the system isn’t responding fast enough to react to user input and make a change on screen.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/10855\nThis talk is focused on iOS which is far more simple than macOS since less program variability and less modifications are possible on iOS compared to macOS. Depending on how fast your display syncs, you might have a small issue where one program is causing the system to triple buffer or worse or you might have a more complex situation where several programs are overloading some portion of the system.\nFirst steps are use Activity Monitor to check for things like GPU or CPU overloads or just high usage. Lots of background processes or a stuck process can aggravate this situation and disrupt the pipeline of inputs.\nAlso, if there is a faulty device in your USB or thunderbolt buses they could be flooding the input without you realizing it and removing that extra input might fix the issue immediately.\nMore likely is you’ve changed the system and will need to backup all your data and apps and settings and perhaps try a clean install and make sure the OS and hardware alone can keep up with your pointer.\nOnce you’ve ruled out hardware and tested a clean OS, restore your data and then analyze if some app or setting or change has had an impact on the performance. This last step is hard and can take a long time, so unless you have a hunch which app or change is causing the performance issue, it is sometimes easier to focus on a clean slate to confirm it’s not a bug. Either way you approach this, good luck - the interaction between apps can get hard to track even with half a dozen apps and utilities added to one build.\n\nA: I have this problem occasionally, on a wired mouse (Roccat Kova+ specifically).\nYou can literally see the mouse pointer moving around on its own if you leave the mouse untouched on the desk.\nSolution for me has been to change the DPI on my mouse - I can do that on a button on my mouse, but if not try changing the tracking speed in MacOS settings.\nI assume changing the DPI also resets whatever is causing the sensor to think it's moving slightly when it is not.\nNote: I can cycle the DPI through the options, back to the one I was on originally, and the problem disappears, so it's not a problem with that particular DPI, and I don't have to start using a different DPI - just cycle through back to the one I want.\n\nA: I finally found an answer to this problem.\nI have been using this DELUX wireless mouse via USB dongle which I purchased on Taobao.\nAfter all, the problem was that I had to recharge its batteries. Yes, it was that simple!\nYou may be wondering why I didn't think about that, to begin with. The reason is that since this mouse has a USB Type-C input, I was using the same cable and charger that I use for my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra phone. And I didn't realize that it was not working. After trying to change many things on macOS and not being successful, I tried to change the charging cable and also the charger. I used a standard USB charger (not type-C) and just used a converter to output the power as USB type-C since that is what my mouse needs.\nAfter the battery was recharged properly, my mouse is working fine again.\n\nA: So this is not an answer exactly; more of a workaround that I've found. To be clear, this is more than just a mouse/trackpad input problem. I know because when my cursor starts stuttering, if I'm watching a show (say on the TV App), the video stutters in the exact same manner. Some answers above associate the problem with secondary monitors. I think that could be correct. I use a USB-C to Display Port adapter (not thunderbolt). And my external monitor is 144Hz (not sure if the 60Hz and 144Hz refresh rate difference is part of it). I've done all the normal SMC NVRAM reset stuff - not fixed. I even re-installed macOS with a completely deleted and re-setup filesystem - not fixed. It even does it in Internet Recovery Mode.\nSo anyway, the only way I've found to fix it is to restart the computer each morning. Sometimes I have to restart two or three times, but eventually it stops doing it. I may try switching out my USB-C to Display Port for a Thunderbolt Dock with Display Port built-in. See if that makes a difference.\n\nA: I've been having similar issues on MacBook Pro 16\" 2019 after upgrading to Big Sur with mouse pointer being laggy when using a mouse connected via Bluetooth or a trackpad. I've also noticed that the text input has been lagging behind typing in different applications including basic editors and terminal.\nThere is pretty long (18 pages at the moment of writing) thread on Apple developer forum discussing similar issues, and one of the workarounds listed there that also worked for me was to disable \"Automatic graphics switching\" under System Preferences -> Battery -> Battery. A word of caution: this will increase battery usage.\nThat's how one of the posters explain the root cause of the issue:\n\nThe problem is actually in the video card intel hd graphics 630 - when you do not do anything with the interface - its frequency is 0 - and when you open a new window or print a video card does not have time to increase the frequency from 0 to 300/400 mhz - apple need not lower the frequency to 0 - but they can't do it because then the autonomy will suffer - hence the conclusion.\n\n\nA: I had a unifying dongle that was broken (no response), and I was trying to figure out if I could revive it (for fun). I forgot that I left it in the USB port (on the back of my iMac), and ive been trying to fix this annoying bug for the past day. After seeing this, I noticed the bad dongle on the back of my Mac. Unplugging it instantly fixed my issue. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD, my Mac has been unusable for the past day and it has been driving me crazy!!!!\n\nA: SOLVED: In my case it was my Thunderbolt USB dongle.  Funny enough the mouse was janky even if not plugged into the dongle.\nPlugging the dongle into a different Thunderbolt port fixed it.\n\nA: Great thread - this issue is complex for sure w no guarantee you'll find root cause.\nMy suggestion:\n\n*\n\n*If using a laptop, confirm the problem is also happening on the trackpad.  If so, it's not a bluetooth issue and you can disregard any bluetooth related troubleshooting. Go to #2. Otherwise, check your batteries, reset bluetooth, etc - simple stuff\n\n\n*Do yourself a favor and no matter how confident you are that everything you have plugged in couldn't possibly be causing the problem and unplug it all.  Yep - it's a pain.  Goal is to keep it simple.  After all is unplugged, confirm the issue with the trackpad mouse persists or it has now magically gone away.  If it persists, it's likely software and you may want to consider uninstalling your high-suspect items until the problem goes away.  Otherwise go on to #3\n\n\n*While your trackpad mouse is working fine now, your bluetooth mouse should be too. If trackpad works but bluetooth mouse still lags, my guess is you should go back to #1. Otherwise, plug your devices back in 1-by-1 until you find the culprit. For me, it was a USB-C cable driving USB devices - I have no idea what the issue is/was. The comment above about a rogue USB device flooding the bus could be accurate.  It's also possible you'll plug everything back in and the problem just went away... at least for now.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can one re-create Apple’s defunct ‘Back To My Mac’ service with specific open-source tools? Question: how can one re-create Apple’s defunct ‘Back To My Mac’ service with specific open-source tools or, if necessary, with limited custom (non-commercial) software?\n(Ideally, this would be done in a way that would preserve integration with Apple applications such as Finder or Terminal; that might, however, happen automatically as soon as a VPN allowing network discovery is enabled on a particular computer.)\n\nBackground: Apple discontinued the 'Back to My Mac' service in 2019 after twelve years of operation.\nAs I understand it, this used a combination of Wide-Area Bonjour, a VPN, and probably some sort of iCloud database/directory to automatically keep all of the Macs signed in under a particular AppleID on a VPN so that they could communicate and use built-in services such as file sharing (AFP/SMB), screen sharing, and SSH through NATs and with dynamic IP addresses. No network configuration was required, once one had signed into a computer with their AppleID and enabling the checkbox for 'Back to My Mac' in Settings.\nThe other computers appeared in the Finder (and in other applications, such as Terminal) just as they currently do if they were on the same network.\nI believe the AppleTV (and possibly other devices) were also used to provide Wake-on-LAN functionality.\n\nConjecture: It is possible that Apple discontinued this for any number of these (or other) reasons:\n\n*\n\n*to minimize their engineering / maintenance costs\n\n*to drive iCloud Drive storage revenue\n\n*they had been licensing some of the underlying technology since the beginning, and wanted to avoid those costs\n\n*a key component was found to be covered by someone else's patent, patent(s) they were unwilling or unable to license\n\nIt is of note, however, that they disabled the feature for all existing installations of older operating systems, instead of just making it an unsupported / depreciated feature.\n\nPossible starting points:\n\n*\n\n*if either of the last two reasons are true, does anyone know the patent numbers (or patent holders) and technologies that were licensed?\n\n\n*are there any open-source replacements for this functionality (beyond what Apple mentions in the above link)?\n\n\n*what technical references are available documenting Apple's implementation and what is still missing to create an open-source replacement?\n\n\n*do you know of any other online discussions of this topic that can be linked to this question?\n\nTechnologies used by some iteration of BTMM:\n\n*\n\n*DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD; RFC 6763, RFC 8553, RFC 8552) to announce host reachability information\n\n\n*Dynamic DNS update (RFC 2136) to refresh the DNS resource records (RRs) when a host detects network changes\n\n\n*DNS Long-lived Queries (LLQ / DNS-LLQ) to notify hosts immediately when the answers to their earlier DNS queries have changed (Wikipedia and IETF)\n\n\n*IPv6 Unique Local Address (ULA; RFC 4193) as the host identifier\n\n\n*NAT Port Mapping Protocol (PMP / NAT-PMP; RFC 6886) to assist NAT traversal\n\n\n*Kerberos (RFC 4120) for end-to-end authentication\n\n\n*IPsec (RFC 4301) to secure data communications between two end hosts\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Understanding Apple's Back to My Mac (BTMM) Service - RFC 6281 (June 2011)\n\n*Take Control of Back To My Mac\n\n*Publishing Network Services - Apple Developer Library Archive\n\n*Authentication and Identification in Depth - Apple Developer Library Archive\n\n*Is it possible to use Back To My Mac DNS or routing information from the command line? - AskDifferent\n\n*Looking for information about the inner workings of Back To My Mac  - AskDifferent\n\n*Did You Realize Apple’s “Back To My Mac” MobileMe Service Uses IPv6?\n\n*How does Back To My Mac work without UPnP or NAT-PMP?  - AskDifferent\n\nThank you!! (and thanks to jksoegaard for comments to the previous question)\nNote to moderator(s): this is a edited restatement of a previous question, “What technical and/or patent information exists for Apple's discontinued 'Back to My Mac' (BTMM) service, and/or what are possible replacements”, that was recently auto-deleted; if you close this current question in the future, please consider doing so in a way that allows it to remain as a searchable reference for future users.\n\nA: Your question is broad and contains numerous elements, therefore I'll need to enumerate my answer accordingly:\nStarting point 1:\nI cannot see how any of the involved technology could be patented, nor that any technology as such is licensed here. Apple could ofcourse be licensing an implementation, but they would be able to reimplement themselves. The BTTM system can be re-implemented in a variety of ways using various protocols and technologies and still end up with similar functionality - so patents is not a problem in recreating similar functionality.\nNote also that modern versions of similar systems exist in the market place now. For example you could just install Tailscale and have similar access to all of your devices. As long as you're a single user and have less than 100 devices, it is free of charge.\nStarting point 2:\nThere are open-source versions of almost everything included in Apple's BTTM system. You would however need to integrate those yourself and make it scalable. This would involve things like automatizing a CA, having a specialized DNS-server, etc. It is not rocket science, but it's not something you do in a Sunday afternoon either.\nNote that there's a big difference between making a service like Apple's BTTM that is supposed to support thousands (if not millions) of users and even more devices - and making something that will just work for your own purposes. If you're just looking for some way to create a BTTM-like experience for yourself, it can be done much simpler than trying to replicate Apple's BTTM system.\nStarting point 3:\nFor a technical reference you can just look up RFC6281. It holds information enough for a professional (or motivated hobbyist) to create a similar system. However if the goal is to make it interoperable with Apple's BTTM service (i.e. used with the clients included in older versions of macOS) - that is much harder (bordering on impossible) and not worth doing. Some of the issues here is that you wouldn't have access to Apple's secret keys, their me.com domain and the custom protocols for AppleID authentication.\n", "Q: OCSP Errors - Firefox - macOS Certain websites are failing when I have \"security.OCSP.require: true\" set in Firefox. Normal websites work, but when visiting commonly used websites (Facebook, GitHub, Spotify) it fails 90% of the time.\nWhat could be causing this?\nFirefox Version: 84.0b7\nMacOS Version: 10.15.7\n\n\nA: There are multiple causes of this - it could for example be a server error, overloaded server, no route/path to the OCSP server, etc.\nWhen the check fails, Firefox displays an error code that will tell you the reason. The text looks like this:\n\nAn error occurred during a connection to www.facebook.com. The OCSP\nserver experienced an internal error. (Error code: XXXXXXXXX)\n\nThe XXXXXXX part will tell you what the problem was.\nThe problem you're experiencing is actually on of the main drawbacks of OCSP. By default, failing to check the status of the certificate online will just show you the page anyways - effectively bypassing the whole point of OCSP. On the other hand, setting it required as you did, makes it likely that you will experience web sites that won't display - even though you know they're up and running and \"should\" have been working.\nThe newer OCSP stapling standard attempts to remove the drawback while keeping the benefits by essentially letting the server do the OCSP check periodically, and keeping a timestamped, signed receipt of that check around for sending to clients.\n", "Q: move grub from sd-card to win partition? i'm not the first one with this kind of problem, but my specific nuance, i did not yet encounter: i have a 2014 macbook pro with os x plus a windows 10 bootcamp partition. now i wanted to have a look at ubuntu and managed to install that on an sd-card. all that worked, but the situation i have now is:\n\n*\n\n*if i start without the sd-card inserted and option pressed, i can choose between os x and windows. loading os x works, loading windows does not and results in a grub prompt.\n\n*if i start with the ubuntu sd-card inserted and option pressed, i get all three options. again, os x works and windows fails, but this time with a grub error message. choosing ubuntu successfully starts grub and gives me the option of booting either ubuntu or windows: which both work.\n\nfrom my understanding (which might be wrong), part of grub ended up on the windows (or efi??) partition, the rest with the actual configuration on the external ubuntu sd-card. is there any way to move this second part to the windows partition? so i can still start windows without this external sd card? in an ideal world, i would just get rid of grub and use the apple bootloader for all of this, but i assume this is not a possibility, is it?\n\nA: You can setup a grubless boot of Ubuntu which can be executed by the Mac boot loader, however the Mac Startup Manager will not detect such an arrangement. You would have to use a different boot manager such as rEFInd.\nAnother solution would be to install grub entirely on the SD card, leaving the EFI partition on the internal drive use by Windows. Or, create a second EFI partition on the internal drive, so the grub and Windows boot files will not overlap.\nMoving Grub Boot Files to the SD Card\nWhen installing Ubuntu on the SD card, an EFI partition should be created on this card. The Grub boot files should be installed in the EFI partition. The However, the Ubuntu installation software will install the Grub boot files on internal drive EFI partition instead. Below are instructions for moving these files to the EFI partition on the SD card.\n\nNote: The steps below assume the device name for the SD card is /dev/sdb. If your device name is different, then make the appropriate substitutions when entering the commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Turn off automatic updates. Open \"Software & Updates\" and set \"Automatically check for Updates:\" to Never. See the image below.\n\n\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n\n*Verify the first partition on the SD Card is FAT formatted. Enter following command.\nsudo blkid /dev/sdb1\n\nIf the TYPE is not equal to vfat, then the first partition on the SD card is not an EFI Partition. If TYPE is equal to vfat, then record the UUID value and proceed with these instructions.\n\n\n*Move the Grub boot files to the SD Card. Enter the following commands.\ncd ~\nmkdir efi\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 efi\nsudo mv /boot/efi/EFI/Boot efi/EFI/boot\nsudo mv /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu efi/EFI/ubuntu\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nrmdir efi\n\n\n\n*Update the /etc/fstab file so Ubuntu will know the new location of the Grub boot files. Enter the following command.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nFind the line with the mount point /boot/efi. Replace the UUID value on this line with with the value recorded in step 4. Exit the editor and save the change.\n\n\n*The installation of Ubuntu replaced the bootx64 file that was first created by the Boot Camp installation. The following commands rectify this replacement. (The bootx64.efi and bootmgfw.efi files used by Windows are the same.)\nsudo mkdir /boot/efi/EFI/Boot\nsudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\n\n\n\n*Restart the Mac and boot back to Ubuntu.\n\n\n*If necessary, restore automatic updates to the previous setting.\n", "Q: Wake On Lan behavior with Mac Mini - how to put asleep and confirm wake success? Experimenting with Wake On Lan, I tested with a small Fujitsu Esprimo mini computer and a Mac Mini.\nIn a Windows desktop app \"WakeMeOnLan\" on another unrelated computer, I can see \"green\" dots for awake clients, and \"red\" dots for sleeping clients. I can put the Esprimo to sleep, so the dots turn red, but not the Mac Mini. How can I test if my Wake On Lan works?\nEsprimo with Ubuntu\n\n*\n\n*makes a \"click\" noise when switched on, so I know it worked.\n\n*The colored app indicators change between green and red, as expected.\n\n*SSH connection drops on sleep via pm-suspend.\n\nMac Mini with latest OS\n\n*\n\n*LED stays on always\n\n*Monitor turns off when starting sleep via SSH and pmset sleepnow.\n\n*Even after sleepnow, the colored app indicators are always green (unless the Mac is really switched off, so I can't wake on lan anyway)\n\n*SSH connection stays alive\n\n*After some time of inactivity the MAC's LED pulsates slowly, which at least gives an indications of a changed state. Still, the colored indicator in my wake-app is still green not red.\n\nWith the mac I have tested hibernate modes 0,3,25. Energy saving settings are those:\n\n*\n\n*[ ] Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\n\n*[X] Put hard disks to sleep when possible\n\n*[X] Wake for Network Access\n\n*[X] Start up automatically after a power failure\n\n*[ ] Enable Power Nap\n\nOutput of pmset -g\n\nHow can I be sure that the Mac is sleeping actually? (LED, SSH connection,...)\nI need a way to proof that my Wake On Lan actually works for the Mac. It might just be a typical Mac issue, but I have no clue about Apple stuff.\n\nA: To determine if a computer is sleeping:\n\n*\n\n*Use hardware, such as the ‘Caps Lock’ led on a wired keyboard as a proxy for sleep, or the connection light on certain bluetooth hardware\n\n*Prior to putting the computer to sleep, check for potential ‘Power Assertions’ that could be blocking sleep\n\n*Review the Console system logs afterwards, looking for messages relating to sleep and wake events\n\n*Ping the Mac’s local network IP address from another computer - a properly sleeping computer should not respond (at least not in a timely fashion) to a normal ICMP ping (but this may not be decisive for recent macOS versions on recent Macs)\nThings like music playback or open SSH connections are good indicators of wakefulness but not of sleep, partially due to #2 above.\nThe pulsing computer LED is a prima facie indicator of sleep.\n\nNote: if you have certain other Apple devices on your network (certain Apple TV and iPad models, and maybe other Macs and Airport devices), the indicator in your WoL app is likely green because you have “Wake for Network Access” enabled.\nThese devices monitor the network for connection attempts to your sleeping Mac’s local IP or MAC address - if they see that network traffic, they will send a WoL packet and wake your computer (it’s sort of a proxy WoL system). In this case, your Windows WoL app (or another network device) could actually be what is unintentionally keeping your computer awake.\n", "Q: Why does Terminal not honor preferences? Sometime in the last week my Terminal stopped honoring the \"New tabs open with: Same Working Directory\" setting.

If I could edit the shortcut's definition as JSON, XML, or whatever on my Mac and then import it back into the Shortcuts app, that would be wonderful.  Is this possible?\nI've never used XCode but is that a possibility if text editing is not?\nI have the complete list of table entries in plain text format already, if there is some other approach rather than retyping all of them.\n\nA: Currently this is not possible, unless you want to edit it in a plist format as states by @grg, but you could use an application called ScPL to write your shortcuts, then convert it to a .shortcut file and import it. There is also Shortcutor, however it is a paid app.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Monterey, you can edit most shortcuts on macOS with the companion app. Monterey is expected later this month/year.\nNot all shortcuts can be edited - actions that are not supported on Mac (such as controlling cellular service) will not be editable, but the shortcut overall will be.\n\n\nA: Shortcuts are just property list files.

You can do this in the Finder, via the command line, or with a tool such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper!\n\n*Delete the original HFS+ partition and rename the remaining HFS+ partition as desired. Now your disk will have a block of free space between the APFS container and the HFS+ partition\n\n*Use Disk Utility (or terminal commands) to increase the size of the APFS container (disk0s2) and then the APFS volume (“Macintosh HD - Data”, I presume, in your case) as needed.\n\n\nNote to others:\nThere is another time you will get “insufficient space” errors when trying to modify or add partitions: often on external USB hard drives that still have their factory formatting, the EFI partition is either missing or too small for macOS.\nMicrosoft recommends it be at least 100 MB, but macOS requires a larger size (200 MB, I believe).\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur YubiKey Login Freezing Issue\nAfter upgrading to macOS Big Sur's update on 11/19/20, the login screen freezes intermittently, after entering the YubiKey login pin, requiring the MacBook Pro to be shut down completely and turned on again.\nThe YubiKey issue has been documented from a few sources.\n\n*\n\n*Reddit - MacOS Big Sur SmartCard Authentication issues\n\n*Apple Discussions\n\n*\n\n*Stuck at lock screen, macOS Big Sur\n\n*Big Sur and smart cards\nMacBook Pro Configuration\n\n*\n\n*Two-Factor authentication enabled with a YubiKey 5C\n\n*OS: macOS Big Sur, Version 11.0.1\n\n*Device: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019)\n\n*Processor: 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9\n\n*Memory: 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4\n\nAttempted Solutions\n\n*\n\n*Restart the computer.\n\n*Shutdown and turn back on.\n\n*Reset NVRAM.

They should both display the date and time when the last backup has been completed, so you should be able to check both.\nIn your case I assume you have not selected the chat backup method in WhatsApp, but the second one, backing up your complete iPhone. Yet, if the last successful backup was completed one month ago, there is no way to retrieve newer Chats.\n\nAs a general rule: If you are not 100% that your data is in a backup, never modify important apps and documents.

I saw some online articles that suggested you create a \"Multi-Output Device\" in the Audio-MIDI-Setup software. But I tried that and I cannot get it to connect to Teams (i.e. I cannot select this Multi-Output Device as my \"microphone\" in Teams).\nDoes anybody know how this can be achieved? Thanks!\n\nA: Usually, whenever you need to stream the audio from your PC, you only need the audio from a single programme, because otherwise also the incoming audio from your conference members in MS Teams would be streamed back to them as well. When you start screen sharing, or sharing a particular programme, there should be an option to share audio as well, at least this is how MS Skype works so I think Teams will do it similarly. So in order to share for example the audio from a video file, you can open it with whatever software you want, and then just share this software with the screen sharing option.

I need to programatically get the Volume Serial Number of a FAT volume (for example, a USB drive or removable SD card) in mac OS. Do you know of any program with which to do it? (Bonus points for a Python API call!)\nTo clarify, I'm asking for the hyphenated 8-hex-digit number that is displayed by the vol command in DOS:\nC:\\>vol e:\nVolume in Drive E is MYSDCARD\nVolume Serial Number is E432-EF79\n\nE432-EF79 is the VSN I'm looking for. It may sometimes be referred to as a UUID, though it's not 128 bits long.\nOn Mac I can mount the drive, and get its volume name, using commands like df. I can inspect it in DiskUtility, and see things like capacity and device name. But how do I get the VSN?\n\nA: For a FAT32 formatted disk, in Terminal, the following example compound command will output its volume serial number:\nvar=\"$(sudo dd if=/dev/diskNs1 skip=67 bs=1 count=4 2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '4/4 \"%X\"')\"; echo \"${var:0:${#var}/2}-${var:${#var}/2}\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace N in /dev/diskNs1 with the correct disk number.\n\n*\n\n*You can use the mount command or diskutil list to ascertain the disk number of the target disk.\n\n\n\n*Note that the target disk needs to first be unmounted before running the example compound command.\n\nAssuming the target disk is mounted as /dev/disk6s1, in Terminal use:\ndiskutil unmountDisk disk6\n\nAfter the target disk is unmounted, then use:\nvar=\"$(sudo dd if=/dev/disk6s1 skip=67 bs=1 count=4 2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '4/4 \"%X\"')\"; echo \"${var:0:${#var}/2}-${var:${#var}/2}\"\n\nFor my test disk, a USB flash drive formatted FAT32, the output was:\n18E4-4FA7\n\nI confirmed this with the vol command in Windows and the blkid command in Linux, and the output of vol and blkid matched the output of the example compound command above.\n\nNotes:\nWith FAT32 volumes, the Volume Serial Number is stored in the Boot Sector at offset 67 (0x43), and is four bytes long.\nInteresting Reading: Volume Serial Numbers\nand Format Date/Time Verification\nThere may be a way to format the output of the dd command with hexdump to avoid the rest of the compound command, however, I didn't want to take the time to figure it out and chose to use parameter expansion and shell arithmetic instead for the final formatting.\n\nA: Q: \"how do I get the VSN?\"\nThis Wikipedia article indicates the FAT VSN is based on the RTC in the system used to create or format the disk. Interestingly, it's said that Microsoft & IBM created the VSN to keep up with an early innovation by Apple!\nAs you've suggested, it seems that the the label UUID is used in some systems instead of VSN - e.g. this seems to be the case with the lsblk utility widely used in most Linux/Unix systems. However, macOS (specifically the diskutil tool) uses a \"true\" 128-bit UUID for FAT volumes. For FAT volumes then, there are two methods for creating a \"unique\" identifier. Intuitively, it seems that the 128-bit UUID is much more likely to be \"unique\" than the VSN.\nYou've indicated your preference for the VSN in your question, and that may be \"unique enough\" for your application. However, given that there doesn't seem to be any readily available tools for macOS to easily extract the VSN (vol for macOS :), you may wish to consider an alternative:\nStep 1: Get the device name\n% DEVNM=`diskutil list | grep FAT | grep -o \"disk[0-9]s[0-9]\"`\n% echo $DEVNM\ndisk4s1\n\nStep 2: Get the UUID (EDITED)\nUsing macOS' diskutil piped through grep with a regular expression will output the 128-bit UUID:\n% diskutil info \"$DEVNM\" | grep \"Volume UUID:\" | grep -o '[0-9A-Z]*-[0-9A-Z]*-[0-9A-Z]*-[0-9A-Z]*-[0-9A-Z]*'\n74453B21-2067-3766-8A2D-EA0AC27F99A8\n\nAlternatively:\n\n*\n\n*You asked about a Python API call:\n\n*\n\n*the uuid.py library may be useful generating UUIDs (perhaps for use in Windows?)\n\n\n*The Python FAT Reader project may be useful for extracting VSNs from FAT volumes, but it seems to use dd which will (inconveniently) require the volume be unmounted.\n\n\n\n\n*The article Get FAT Drive Serial Numbers in Unix has a good walk-through & explanation with a CLI for fetching a VSN from several FAT variants. It's similar to another answer here.\n\n\n*If the drive is exFAT, you can use this:\n% sudo newfs_exfat -N disk3s1 | grep Volume Serial\n\nUnfortunately, newfs_msdos doesn't have a facility for outputting the VSN.\n", "Q: Cannot sync photos from photos app to iphone using iTunes When I navigate to photos from my phone settings in iTunes, I am not able to select the photos.app from the \"copy photos from\" dropdown.\nMy Photo Library exist in the Pictures directory and it is set as a system photos library.\nMy photo library is not corrupt.

How do I put FaceTime in a folder and assign a password to the folder? The aim is not to have access to the apps without password.\nI actually want to restrict access to minimize distraction ( tv app, FaceTime, App Store) and I was able to do that without any problem in Catalina, but with Big Sur it's another story.\nI have already tried using screen time but I don't think parental control is the solution to my problem as I want to use the Mac for academic use.  I wanted to prevent myself from being distract by them, but still use safari without any problem. I actually did try activating screen time, but it's not effective (as I explained in screen time, we aren't able to to activate \"Downtime limitations\" and \"limits apps\" but still use Safari) so I'm looking for solutions.\n\nA: I personally don’t recommend blocking things that you as the administrator can unblock, but I understand friction can be good for many people so I would encourage use of screen time - if only to show you the amount of time you spend so you ca track that and build healthy habits over time. Also, it’s quick and easy so start with it while you wait for other answers to arrive.\n\n*\n\n*You can not delete apps in a meaningful way to accomplish your goal in Big Sur. It’s not easy and you have to circumvent the sealed system / patch and update process. Plus you may waste more time than you save in a week, but have at it if someone documents a solution there.\n\n*Use Screen Time to block whole apps.\n\n*Use the SelfControl app to block sites in Safari (and other browsers) https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ\nBe sure you read the self control FAQ. It has some amazing gems of wisdom in it. Good luck tailoring your experience - don’t be out off by parental controls or screen time instructions - that’s the best way to block things without breaking the OS.\n\nA: If you don't want to have access to FaceTime, simply Sign Out from FaceTime.\n\n*\n\n*Open the FaceTime app\n\n*Select Preferences\n\n*Click Sign Out\n\nThen nobody can FaceTime you, nor you can FaceTime to anyone without logging in to the app again.\nIf you just want to disable some apps, create another user account without administrative privileges and then apply Screen Time restrictions to that account.\nLikewise if there are multiple users sharing the Mac, create at least one user account per person and then you can apply unique restriction profiles for the respective user accounts.\n", "Q: How to tell if dmg file contains universal binaries, i.e. if it has been compiled for arm64 hardware Can you tell from a .dmg file if it contains arm64 binaries?\nI've got a Mac mini M1 running Big Sur.

Getting good sound quality on Bluetooth headset seems to depend far more on the Bluetooth profiles used on a connection than the quality of the headset itself.\nAAC is quoted in many articles as \"the profile you need for Apple devices\", and although I found helpful information about finding out the Bluetooth profile used on a given connection, there seems to be no reliable information whether or not AAC really is the only available high-quality audio profile on Apple's mobile OSs.\nSo, which Bluetooth profiles are available for headphone (stereo audio from device to headphone only) and headset (stereo audio from device to headset, likely mono audio from headset to device, simultaneously) use when used with iOS and iPadOS 14?\n\nA: Isn't AAC a codec, not a BT profile?\nSeems AAC is nested in A2DP - ref.

Everything went nicely until this week, when it started charging inconsistently and coconutBattery shows 5-10W of charging. I plug the charger and it says \"battery doesn't charge\". Sometimes reconnecting the charger helps, sometimes not; the same is true about waiting some time. I've reset SMC couple time but it usually doesn't help. I’ve attached of screenshot showing coconutBattery output.\nAlso I’ve ordered a new charger and cable.\n\nA: Sometimes, your mac will do this to preserve the battery. It learns from your charging habits and will wait to charge past 80% until you need it. for example, if you go to work every day (ok, maybe not right now during covid) at 8 o clock, and have your mac charge the entire night, it will charge to 80 during the night, then at around 7 o clock, finish charging, and by 8, it should be at close to 100%.\n\nA: This one's probably going to come down to trial and error.\nPotentially coconutBattery is providing incorrect information, so pay attention to the actual system behavior -- is it draining too quickly? Taking too long to charge? etc.\n\n*\n\n*First see what shows up under System Information under the \"Power\"\nsection. Specifically look at if things are charging and what the\nWattage of the power adapter is. That info can tell you if things appear to be working right, but coconutBattery is misreporting.\n\n*If you have access to another charger, try that out. Look on the adapter if it's a replacement and make sure it's 61W or more.\n\n*If that doesn't work, then there could be a short on the main logic board. If you check out Louis Rossmann he has several videos on charging issues that he's posted. His stuff is entertaining in general but probably not something you'd want to do yourself -- just to understand what might have went wrong.

However, there are other options, among them are:\n\n*\n\n*Move Window to Left Side of Screen\n\n*Move Window to Right Side of Screen\n\nFor those one needs to assign keyboard shortcuts. System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortucts, click on +, keep 'All applications', enter exact text as above into 'Menu Title' and assign shortcut in 'Keyboard Shortcut'. I personally have followed the path of built-in which start with ⌃⌘. For left it's ⌃⌘L and for right it's ⌃⌘R.\nThere is also built-in keyboard shortcut to toggle full screen: ⌃⌘F.

I work on a 13\" MB Pro without an external monitor, and typically I use the touch pad's app exposé function to quickly switch between windows. Most of the applications have a characteristic look, so my brain is usually pretty quick to identify the particular window that I need. Lately, however, both as a result of some uniformity trends in web and application design as well as the particular set of tools my latest job requires, all the windows look the same and it's hard to distinguish applications in exposé.\nGitHub? White screen, black bar on top. AWS console? White screen, black bar on top. Outlook? White screen, black bar. Postman, Jenkins, various StackExchange sites? You see where I'm going with this... App exposé basically shows a lot of very similar looking windows. A few of these allow theming, but it requires that you have full control over the application or web site, so it's not always an option.\nMy question now: is there a way in Mac OS to customize the window title bar color on a per-window basis to make them look more distinct? Are there some other visual customization utilities available? (I noticed, e.g., that Microsoft Teams is able to put a colored frame around a window that's shared with the team).\n\nA: This is not possible.

The external disk was selected as the startup disk and on startup it would automatically boot from that disk.\nAfter the update (and even while updating) my iMac won't automatically boot even if the disk was still selected as the startup disk. It is instead stuck prompting me to look at http://support.apple.com/mac/startup with a flashing folder icon with a question mark. To manage to boot I have to shutdown it and start it while holding the Option key, then after less than a second my SSD shows up, I can select it and the boot would proceed normally.\nThis is not a problem I can't live with, but I would like to fix it, especially to ease the process of updating in the future.\nI recall reading about forcing the boot process to wait for all disks or a specific one to mount before continuing, but I could be thinking about a Ubuntu or Linux thing. Is this the right way, how can I do it? If not, is there another solution?\n\nUpdate: I wouldn't call it a solution, but I've decided to go for a clean install, formatting the SSD and reinstalling Big Sur by booting from an a USB install media created from the installer downloaded from the AppStore. While the boot problem persisted during the installation, I managed to complete it using the Option-boot trick and after that it can now boot automatically from the external SSD (manually re-selecting it as boot disk may have played a role).\n\nA: One solution that worked for my desktop iMacs is to reset the PMU, which I accomplished on the iMac by powering off, unplugging from the wall point, and holding the power button for some seconds before replugging and powering up again.\nToday I came across the same situation on my MacBook Air 2015—completely ignoring the Alt key and also ignoring the Startup Disk setting—so I reset the PMU on the MacBook Air by the conventional means.

My work involves running very long (multiple day) processes in R, so I need to be able to leave things running for a long time with the screen off, so as not to waste energy. At the moment it seems that if the screen goes to sleep, all processes are paused. Is there a way to get the linux/windows behaviour where the screen can time out but everything keeps running?\n(Other similar questions I've found all refer to previous versions of MacOS and/or desktop versions, the system preferences seem to be completely different.)\n\nA: The fastest way to always stop sleep is the built-in Terminal command caffeinate which will let you set various options on preventing sleep.\nAnother way is to disable sleep when plugged into battery under Settings, which is likely the easiest method as it has a visual indicator by way of the charger.\nThe Amphetamine app is yet another method, and it has a friendlier UI compared to Terminal as well as extra options.\nBy default all apps sleep when the display is off unless the app specifically requests otherwise.\n\nA: For Big Sur, go to System Preferences > Battery and select setting for Power Adaptor.

The System Information app popped-up today telling my disk is nearly full (65 gigs of 256 gig drive).\n➥ That tool reports that \"System\" is taking 132 gigs. What exactly do they mean by \"System\", and why is it so large?\nI find it hard to believe that macOS Mojave 10.14.6 is itself so large as to take more than half the smallest size drive that Apple ships. Not so long ago Apple was shipping Macs with 128-gig drives.\nThe Activity Monitor app reports \"Swap used\" as 3.8 gigs. But that still leaves 128-gigs as inexplicably bloated.\nMy Question is similar to What is 'System' on mac laptop storage?. But the accepted Answer there is weak and seemingly incorrect.\n(I won't even bother asking what is \"Music Creation\" and why is it 2 gigs when I don't create music.)\n\n\nA: System is everything on the disk that takes up space and does not fall under other named categories. Unless you have a spotlight issue or the system is still indexing, I would use a tool like Daisy Disk to get a second opinion on system.  Have seen it where a category doesn’t finish indexing so perhaps you have 80 GB of documents, but the indexer crashed at 80 MB and system looks bloated when it’s not.\nWhile that’s running, be sure to take advantage of all the Apple steps to clean things you don’t need: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206996\nIf system remains larger than you like, back up and do an erase install. When you log in, you convince yourself the system is not bloated, but the things you've brought to the Mac are what use the disk space. After that, migrate your data or import things again.\nTo save a double erase, here are sizes of a survey of system sizing per system after importing apps and setting up users and using them for a week to a month:\n\n*\n\n*Mojave: 23.17 GB\n\n*Catalina: 11.31 GB\n\n*Big Sur: 14.95 GB (M1 with Rosetta)\n\nAfter an erase install, you should be even slimmer on the system sizes than listed above.\n", "Q: drag folder shortcut to the left side of the dock Hi I wanted to drag my folder shortcut to the left side of my dock where all the applications are. the folder I have is just a folder with other apps in it from the same manufacturer because I dont want my dock to be very long I did it that way but is there a way to drag a folder to the left side of the dock or maybe an app that does the same thing.\n\nA: Folder shortcuts, & document shortcuts, are stuck at the right hand end of the dock.

The allegation is that I was communicating with other students during the test. Is there was a way I could retrieve a log of the processes/applications that were running on my mac that day, at that time in order to prove no communication-based apps were running during the test?\n\nA: Not really - and the more you try to prove with technical details, you might be sabotaging yourself. It’s easier for you to tamper with the process list than it is to cheat on an online test, so I wouldn’t go down that path at all.\nI would just ask the accuser or referee how you can demonstrate mastery of the material and remedy the situation. It’s awful when your character is accused and it’s awful when you get caught cheating, so either way, you are in a bad situation and grasping for a technicality isn’t going to help you. This is a social problem, not one that can be dismissed without two conditions:\n\n*\n\n*Referee has to be agreeable to a technical summary and adjudication.\n\n*You can in no way be involved in the preparation of any exculpatory data. A forensic investigator has to handle the preservation, preparation, analysis and evaluation of any technical evidence.\n\n", "Q: Why is option + s = ß and option + b = ∫? I am not sure why they choose to do it this way, it makes opposite sense to me because of the shape of each of the letters.\n\nA: A definitive answer would probably require being in the head of the person who defined those assignments. Yes, some option & shift + option characters do have shape relationships. Others have phonetic relationships. Option + s = ß is one of those, since ß as a sound character is related to s. I cannot even speculate on what the basis of option + b = ∫ is.\nYou would have to go way back in time to find out why.  Here is the assignment published by Apple in the manual for the original Mac in 1984. (Note that the colors listed are wrong, Red should be White and Black should be Red.)\n\nThose assignments have remained the same with a lot of additions. The following screenshots of the Keyboard Viewer show all of the current key assignments. The Keyboard Viewer is accessed with Input menu > Show Keyboard Viewer. If you don't have an Input menu (it is a flag icon representing your current input language), go to System Preference > Keyboard > Input Sources & check Show Input menu in menu bar.\nUnmodified keys...\n\nOption modified keys...\n\nThe keys with the orange surround are for accent marks. You type option + key, then an eligible character, so option + e followed by e gives é. If it is followed by an ineligible character, such as option + e followed by w, you get the accent followed by the character, like ´w.\nShift + option modified keys...\n\n\nA: The why is impossible to answer without asking the person, who decided it so. However I would say that a big part of these key assignments is the simple fact that there are few keys on the keyboards, and lots of symbols you would like to produce - therefore you cannot assign a meaningful key to every symbol.\nFor the ß symbol the \"s\" key makes a great deal sense, as the symbol is really a form of s in for example German where it is used quite a lot. Here in Denmark the symbol is known as the \"double-s\". In German you would sometimes (especially in older texts) see it spelled out as \"sz\" if a ß symbol wasn't available.\nFor the ∫ symbol there's simply not a logical connection between the key b and the symbol itself - it would have been more logical that it would be matched with the s key, but as now know, it is already taken by the ß symbol. One interesting bit of information though is that the character code for the ∫ symbol is actually 222B, where as other forms of integral symbols have codes 222C, 222D, etc. I don't know if the Mac keyboard shortcut precedes the Unicode character code assignment or vice versa, but it could be a part of the thought process in assigning the seemingly random b key to that symbol.\n", "Q: Can you turn the pages of an ebook on your iPad with your iPhone?

I work on Apple devices so I have all my work data synced through iCloud (documents folder is steadily synced with Apple iCloud).\nWhat I'm looking for is a solution for data archiving for data which I don't want to have on my local machine but only on the archive media. It's data starting at about year 2000 and consists mostly of private family photos and other personal stuff. Currently about 500GB of data.\nCurrently I have it all spread over three HDD harddisks. I've also put it all together into one big archive on a new LaCie USB-C HDD. I'm afraid one of these HDDs might fail someday so I'm looking for a solution.\nI don't have a network at home (only use iPhone 4G hotspot for internet) so I have no Ethernet connectivity for a NAS or similar. I was thinking of a NAS with RAID 1 although I know it's rather meant for data availability than archiving since it can fail as a whole too.\nWhat do you recommend for my case? I have a feeling there is no \"best practice\" here and I'm a bit lost. I've tried pCloud (similar to Dropbox but better server availability in EU) but I hate their web UI, I think it's really outdated and ugly and that is something that keeps me from a product. I'd really like to have the data on my site too.\n\nA: There exists many time-proven solutions for data archival - so there's lots of best practice advice around.\nYou indicate that you have no existing local network, you have a slow internet connection using a phone hot-spot and you have only about 500 GB of data collected over 20 years that you wish to archive.\nIn this case, I wouldn't have cloud services or NAS devices with old style hard drives in a RAID setup at the top of my list of technologies to use. Those come with recurring operating costs and other drawbacks.\nInstead I would look to storing the data on optical disks or tape. Depending on the product used you have plenty of space, it is relatively cheap to make extra copies and it is local only technology. I.e. for example today you can optical disk recorders that store multiple terabytes of data on a single disk - however, I would advise you to start with one of the cheaper options ofcourse.\nThe advantage of being able to make multiple copies is that:\na) any copy will eventually deteriorate over time and needs to be replaced (this is also the case with RAID-volumes, where hard drives will eventually fail and need to be replaced)\nb) you risk theft of the device, house catching on fire, water damage, etc. - so better to have multiple (encrypted) copies that you can store in other locations\nFor optical disc storage you can start with a simple BluRay. A good quality, archival grade disk probably lasts 20 years without you having to do anything except keeping scratches away. It is ofcourse best to keep them out of light, heat, vibrations, etc. as well.\nI would say that with a budget of 300-400$ you can get a BluRay BDXL burner and a big pack of 100 GB archival discs so you can get all your data stored.\nAnother contender would be using the commonly available, very small sized, SD-cards. These are available at cheap in the capacities you seek, and it is easy to make multiple copies that can be stored in various locations (in the car, at a friends house, etc). They typically last longer than hard drives that have a life-span on average of about 5 years or similar.\n", "Q: How to show open tabs on other devices on Mac Safari?

It started as the black screen issue, that I troubleshooted to find that there was an issue with the CPU tray.  I found this out by doing the usual troubleshooting, replacing the graphics card and then buying a used second machine and interchanging the CPU cards between chassis.\nI ended up replacing the 2009 Octocore CPU tray with an Early 2009 2.8GHz Quad core tray, as this machine has now become a spare machine, but the fans are cranking loudly.\nWhen I run hardware diagnostics I see that the PS, Exhaust and Intake fans are not running and the PCI and Boosta fans are running at 850 rpm - seemingly not too far above min spec.\nI would love to get guidance as to how to get the three fans running again and got my lovely mac pro back to its usual quiet self.  The loud noise is unbearable in my home office.\nThanks for the guidance.\n\nA: After some research I discovered that the fans were blowing because I put a single CPU tray into a machine that originally had a dual CPU tray.

Therefore, the firmware does not support Secure Boot. A Mac with a T2 chip can be configured to only allow booting of macOS and Windows 10. A Mac's firmware can not validate the integrity of a grub efi binary.

And unless I am mistaken, Thunderbolt 2 does NOT support DisplayPort. I do not care about taking advantage of Thunderbolt, meaning no webcam, speakers, and other peripherals.\nDoes anyone know of a solution?\n\nA: Thunderbolt displays require thunderbolt to work. Add a PCI card or see if it can be upgraded to USB 4 which is the same as Thunderbolt 3. Then the 3 to 2 adapters will work to operate the display.\nSorry there is no other way to make these work. Once you get thunderbolt hardware, windows can work with Apple products.\nEssentially, you have a thunderbolt dock with an embedded display and not a display that uses thunderbolt.\n", "Q: How do I have both custom show tv art and custom episode thumbnails?

Like a Drobo 5-Bay DAS Storage.\nMac, Mojave, External NAS, Time Capsule,\n\nA: If the NAS is connected over Ethernet then you are dependant on the NAS software being able to present a share that supports TimeMachine.\nFor example, the Synology series of boxes let's you create a share on any volume (Raid or non-Raid) and has an option to allow TimeMachine backups to be made to this share.\nI have not seen a NAS that would present a drive / share via USB.  A simple external drive can connect to the AP via usb and be used for TimeMachine this way though.\nYou have to be careful moving the backups from one drive to another - the format changes from a direct connected USB drive to those connected via AP or NAS and the actual mount point name will change - the NAS share name can be totally different from the AP name it is connected to.\nBe aware you cannot encrypt the data drive on the AP so you have to set the TimeMachine backups to be encrypted for security of data.\n", "Q: Booting MBP 15\" 2015 without battery I have a MacBook Pro 15\" from Mid-2015.\nUnfortunately the battery started swelling up (funnily the battery menu claims the it to be ok).\nSince it's a stationary computer after I smashed the screen I simply want to run it without battery.\nAs soon as I remove the battery it does not boot anymore.

On the other hand it's a pretty sound theory, electronics wise.\nIs there any possibility to reduce load on boot? I could also try to sacrifice an old AC adapter and solder the MagSafe to either a thicker cable or even to a different power supply...\nAny thoughts on this? Could it be, that the AC adapter is not capable of providing enough power (85W though...)? Or could the wimpy cable introduce too much voltage drop?\n\nA: I wouldn't solder a new cable as you may risk destroying the entire Mac.  It would be best to just buy a replacement battery.  They're around $50 on eBay, but that's a whole lot cheaper than a new Mac if the DIY power cable fries it.\n\nA: The 85W power supply should be able to supply enough power, and the problem is unlikely to be resistance in the cable.\nIt has been observed here and elsewhere that removing the battery on many models of MBP causes severe CPU throttling.\nCan MacBooks run without a battery??\nHowever, there should at least be enough CPU to boot, so it's possible that you have some other problem.

You can test it on your machine - Calculator app also refuses to go full screen because it is just an instrument.\nSo the devs concluded that Activity Monitor is not something that users would want in full screen. Users would rather want it on the side while they are focused on the actual program whose CPU/Memory/Disk/Network activity they want to keep an eye on.\n\nThe section of human interface guidelines on design for full screen mode has this guidance:\n\nEnable full-screen windows only when it makes sense. Full-screen mode is useful when a user wants to be immersed in a task, but not all apps require immersion. For example, some utility apps like Calculator work better with smaller windows that reside onscreen alongside other apps. When porting an iOS app to macOS, don’t assume the app must support full-screen mode in macOS\n\nPerhaps, the utility aspect of this is prioritized so the menu bar isn’t hidden for people that wish to be immersed in the activity display.\n", "Q: How can I transfer all data except photos to a different iPhone? I need to send my iPhone in for a screen repair, which quotes a 5-9 day turnaround time.  In the interim, I would like to use my previous, smaller storage capacity iPhone.  Ideally, I would want to be able to use all my apps with its app data.  I can't just do a transfer or a restore from backup, since my new phone has more storage capacity used than the old phone's max capacity.  If I were to do a transfer without the photographs, it would fit without a problem, and would be plenty acceptable.\nIs there any way to transfer all data without images to the new phone, or barring that, at least the application data?

Where did this 8GB go?\n\nA: Very likely pagefile &/or hiberfile, each of which can be the same size, or even larger than, your total RAM size. You can remove/disable the hiberfile but not the pagefile.\nHaving only 8GB free space on a drive is actually critically low anyway. You ought to have at least 10% even on a large drive/boot volume. On a tiny drive unfortunately you really need even more. 15 - 20 GB would be the minimum free space I'd recommend on a drive that size.\nHow-to-Geek has an article on how to disable hiberfile - What Is hiberfil.sys and How Do I Delete It? which I won't précis here as it's really a Windows issue not Mac. Basically, you stop Windows from allowing Hibernate then you can delete the file.\nThere are many disk/map/storage apps for Windows so you can see what may be using more space than you'd like -  I don't use Windows enough to know which might be best suited.

Going into Terminal, however, I can see executable permissions are enabled for the app, just like for every other app.\nWhat can I do to be able to open the app?\n\nA: Was having this issue with Eclipse.

I suspect that this issue has not been resolved in the intervening years, meaning that the app modifies itself and thus breaks its own code signature.\n\nForcing a replacement of the application's signature fixed it for me:\n% codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Eclipse.app\n\n/Applications/Eclipse.app: replacing existing signature\n\n\nA: In playing with the Triangulator app I found the following issues on Big Sur:\n\n*\n\n*When decompressing the .zip, the application contents didn't retain the execute bits.  Add it back with sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/app.\n\n*Since the application was downloaded by a web browser (in my case) the quarantine bits are set on the decompressed files.  Remove that with sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app.\n\nOnce those issues are remediated then the application can be launched.\n-Eric\n\nA: This is a known, not fully resolved problem with some apps, probably older apps which haven't been updated for Big Sur.\nHere are some other things you can try in addition to the answers already given.\n1. Set permissions not only for the app bundle but for all files contained within (you may have done this but it's not clear from what's been said so far):\nUsing Terminal, enter the following, with the trailing space\nsudo chmod -R 755 \n\nand then drag the app bundle onto the Terminal window, press enter, and enter your password if asked.\n2. Using Terminal, install upx with brew:\nIf you don't have Homebrew installed, you can first install it with\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nThen run brew install upx\nThen run this command, substituting the path of your app's executable for the part after sudo upx -d , and enter your password if asked:\nsudo upx -d /Applications/my_app.app/Contents/MacOS/my_app\n\nTo open an app bundle to find the executable, right click it in the Finder and click 'Show Package Contents'.\n3. Contact the app developer to ask for any support they can give, or an updated version of the app.\nThis may well be all you can do at this stage, except for downgrading your Mac back to Catalina.\n\nA: Good News / Bad News\nGood news: I figured out how to solve the problem for my apps. (Spoiler Alert: The answer for me is: “Open in Rosetta”.)\nBad news: The same solution probably won’t work for everyone, if for no other reason than I believe people are seeing this on Intel Macs.\nTo recap:\nHere is the error message that I was getting when I tried to open either of the two apps in ~/Library/Printers/:\n\nTrying something like this:\nopen ~/Library/Printers/Brother\\ HL-2270DW\\ series.app\nwould lead to this error:\nThe application cannot be opened for an unexpected reason, \nerror=Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-10826 \n\"kLSNoLaunchPermissionErr: User doesn't have permission to launch the app \n(managed networks)\" UserInfo={_LSFunction=_LSLaunchWithRunningboard, \n_LSLine=2508, NSUnderlyingError=0x7fa98a43e450 \n{Error Domain=RBSRequestErrorDomain Code=5 \"Launched process exited during launch.\" \nUserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=Launched process exited during launch.}}}\n\nwhich was not at all helpful.\n\n*\n\n*`open -a 'Brother HL-2270DW series' did not work.\n\n\n*Trying to remove the quarantine flag didn't work\n\n\n*There were no files that were not executable but should have been\n\n\n*Right Click » Open did not prompt me to open it at all.\nWhat fixed it\nSetting these apps to “Open in Rosetta” immediately solved the issue.\n\nI don’t know why.\nSome further thoughts on how I got into this mess…\nNeeded Official Drivers from Brother\nWhen I tried to install the printer, macOS was going to install it as a generic printer. I didn't want that, so I went to the Brother website and found the official Brother Downloads page for the HL-2270DW.\nNow, that page only mentions compatibility with macOS 10.15, and I'm using Big Sur, but I guessed that it would work and probably just had not been updated for Big Sur yet because some companies take forever to do that.\n“Did I install this .pkg using Rosetta? Does it matter?”\nI use iTerm as my default terminal app, and I have it set to always open using Rosetta, which was recommended for making brew work with Big Sur on M1 macs.\nAs a result, anything that I do while using iTerm is done as if this is an Intel Mac.\nHere’s the weird part: Lots of times when I run into a .pkg that I need to install, I have a shell script that runs sudo /usr/sbin/installer with the proper parameters. So chances are good that I installed the Brother drivers with that script.\nIn iTerm.\nRunning in Rosetta.\nDoes that matter? I really have no idea. It’s entirely possible that I could have installed this with the regular Installer.app and had the same experience. But the fact that I had to manually set the printer apps to run under Rosetta makes me at least wonder if that would have been true even if the Installer app had been running as an Apple Silicon process.\nConclusion: I should probably test that. I should also probably stop using my pkg installer shell script in iTerm (I might be able to use it in Terminal.app which I left to run as an Apple Silicon process).\nPro-Tip: Get Suspicious Package and set it as the default app for all .pkg files. It’s free and it’s fantastic.\nOne “Trick” that I used to help solve this…\nI launched the app via lldb like so:\nlldb ~/Library/Printers/Brother\\ HL-2270DW\\ series.app/Contents/MacOS/PrinterProxy\nOnce it was ready, I typed run and it worked. That’s what first tipped me off that “Open Using Rosetta” might solve it, once I remembered that iTerm was running under Rosetta which means that lldb was running as an Intel process.\nHave an M1 Mac? Now you have another troubleshooting step to try.\nMight take a while to get this one to soak in (at least for me), but clearly “Have you tried running it under Rosetta?” is another question we should ask ourselves/others when trying to diagnose issues on M1-based Macs.\n\nA: Remove the ‘quarantine’ attribute from the file via:\nsudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine *FILENAME*\n\nThat should fix it.\nF.\n\nA: I may have a solution. Check to see if you have two (or more) Application folders. You should only have one at the top level of your disk. Click on your hard drive and your should see your main Applications Folder (as well as Library, System and Users). If you Open Users, your username and see an Applications folder there with the problematic apps, you have found your problem. Move your apps to the Main Application folder or reinstall into that folder. You may have to Boot into Restore mode, launch Terminal and run repairHomePermissions (case sensitive) to get the installs to go into the right place.\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur - Set quick look provider for specific file types?

I have a Mac mini in my office. I have a wireless keyboard and mouse that can easily reach between the two locations, but am not willing to walk between them to turn on Airplay.\nI'd like to connect via AirPlay with a keystroke from my wireless keyboard, which would turn on Airplay to my living room computer. I would prefer this to be silently performed in the background.\nThis is apparently quite difficult. I spent two hours on the command line approach. I found no working commands.

And the same transfer SUCCEEDS on my iPad Pro (2018).\nWhy/How is this failing?\n\nA: I Googled this issue and found a question on Apple's forums, but sadly with no answers.\nComparative Analysis:\nI was fortunate to have uploaded the same folder successfully on an iPad Pro (2018) running IOS 14.2. This proved it was certainly possible, just not on my iPad Air 2 running the same version of IOS 14.2\nSo same folder containing same files, both devices running the most current version of IOS- 14.2. Airdrop succeeds on the iPad Pro (1TB storage), but reports a \"cancelled\" error on the sending device, a Macbook Pro (2018) running OSX 10.15.7 despite the iPad Air 2 (128 GB) having the required free space.  Oh, and Bluetooth was doing nothing other than Airdrop at the time of the issue.\nTesting:\nThe Airdrop was attempted again after rebooting the iPad Air 2.  I also tried disabling and re-enabling the Bluetooth on both the sending and receiving devices for the sake of completeness.\nDid some testing to see if file size was a limiting factor by incrementally removing chunky files and retrying the transfer.\nSolution:\nThat was it: only after I got the folder size down to 1.5 GB, did Airdrop succeed.\nThen I had to airdrop the chunky files I removed to get the total folder size down to 1.5 GB and move them back into the folder on the receiving iPad Air 2. So the same volume of data was transferred in the end, proving that it wasn't down to insufficient local storage.\nConclusion:\nSince Airdrop worked with my more modern iPad Pro 2018, may only be an issue for folks using Airdrop as target devices with older legacy iPhones/iPads. Anyhoo, at least I can tell you what worked for me; YMMV.  Hope this gets you out of a hole if you bump into the same problem-\n\nA: I do a lot of video file manipulation for my work and use AirDrop a lot between iPhones (12 mini, XR and 6S), MacBook Pro 13” 2020, and older iPad Mini.\nSo I’ve had my fair share of AirDrop problems. I’ve tried everything, from shutting down and turning on devices, turning on and off the Bluetooth, and restarting the MacBook.\nUsually I AirDrop from MacBook to one of the iPhones, though.\nIf I get a “Cancelled” (sometimes it’s “Declined”) message on my MacBook after trying to AirDrop to an iPhone, the trick that always seems to work is to delete several files from the iPhone.\nUsually I already have tons of space available, like just now I had 51.1GB of 128GB of memory free on the iPhone 12 Mini, yet AirDrop from the MacBook still resulted in “Cancelled”.\nBut then it worked after I deleted a few videos from the iPhone.\nI have no idea why this works when there is so much free memory already available, but it just does, for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem for a while when sharing files between two of my macs. I've just realised that the problem I experienced had to do with Umlauts in the filenames (it's not limited to Umlauts, but it's an easy enough to understand example).\nThe files that I tried / failed to share were created with an application that didn't correctly write the Umlauts into the file's name. Finder was capable of showing the Umlauts correctly and most file operations work. AirDrop doesn't work though.\nThe easiest solution is to rename or move the file. In both cases Finder will correctly update the Umlauts and it will be able to send the files via AirDrop.\nBeware: the problem may not be limited to the file's name but could also be in the directory / directories that the file's located in.\n\nTechnical detail:\nmacOS uses Unicode normalisation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normalization and once Finder modified the file's name, its filename is normalised and everything works.\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur Macbook does not respond to ping on neither ethernet or WiFi I cannot ping my mac that is running macOS Big Sur 11.0.1\nIt

include a built-in firewall because the VPN connection can have firewall rules that are defined by the VPN site administrator.\n\n*Checkpoint VPN is compatible with 10.15 Catalina and 11.0 Big Sur. When you install it, you MUST go to the System Preferences->Privacy and allow their extensions. Then reboot before trying to use it.\n\nNote on the previous answer:\nlaunchctl changed in newer macOS releases. Previously, you could edit the *.plist file and change the RunAtLoad and KeepAlive directly. But this is no longer recommended. Instead, you should use launchctl to set the status to enable or disable, for example:\nlaunchctl disable system/com.checkpoint.epc.service\n\nTo list services available, use the print system or print user or print gui options:\nlaunchctl print system\n\nlaunchctl print gui/501 ### Where 501 is the User UID number, 501 is the first account created.\n\nlaunchctl print login/myname ### Where byname is the User login name\n\n\nA: It seems that the Endpoint Security VPN (I have the Checkpoint client but the Symantec is also culpable) mingles around and blocks any incoming connections and any PING echo requests.\nSo the solution is to kill the agent:\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.checkpoint.epc.service.plist\nsudo kextunload /Library/Extensions/cpfw.kext\n\nand turn the AutoLaunch off by setting the RunAtLoad and KeepAlive PLIST values to false:\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.checkpoint.epc.service.plist\n\nI have a script that can be used here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/cyupa/ebb2a80a699d4c2f567b78161cb28767\n", "Q: inscrutable rules for disallowing binaries on a new Apple Silicon (Big Sur) machine EDIT: This problem appears to have been a bug in the Apple code signing mechanism, and has been fixed in the 11.1 Big Sur release candidate. At the moment I write this, you need to enrol in the Apple beta software program to receive this update.\nSoftware versions I used when I encountered this problem, for posterity:\n\n*\n\n*PyCharm: PC-203.5981.165\n\n*Rust toolchain: 1.50.0-nightly (d274fcf86 2020-12-07)\n\n*Rust IntelliJ plugin: 0.3.136.3514-203\n\n*macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (20B50)\n\nHowever, as a matter of academic curiosity, I'm still interested in understanding why this happened. My working hypothesis at the moment is that the codesign metadata was somehow corrupted, but in a way undetected by codesign -dv\n\nI was able to produce a hello-world terminal app that gets SIGKILLed on launch but works as intended after I either\n\n*\n\n*reboot the system, or\n\n*copy the binary to a new location. (After this, it continues to work if I move it back to the original path.)\n\nHowever, it will continue to be SIGKILLed if instead of copying I move the file. Another interesting property of this binary, while in its unoperational state (let's call it bad_hello), is that it crashes codesign -s - bad_hello with the error \"the codesign_allocate helper tool cannot be found or used\", even though codesign_allocate is available and codesign -s - typically works.\nNeedless to say, this is quite puzzling and seems like a bug in the Apple code signing system.\nThat's the long and short of the problem. Now, for more details.\n\nI've recently acquired an Apple Silicon device, and have run into a bizarre problem as soon as I started writing code.\nI made a \"hello world\" project in Rust. Building with the Rust toolchain from the command-line gives me a functioning binary.\nNow, I clear the build artefacts, open my IntelliJ-based IDE, and ask it to build the same project using the same toolchain. It builds. But, I try to run it, and...\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./hello\nzsh: killed     ./hello\n\nIt gets SIGKILLed instantly.\nI put the two files side-by-side. One will be good_hello and the other, bad_hello.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./good_hello            \nhello.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./bad_hello\nzsh: killed     ./bad_hello\n\nThey were built from the same code with the same toolchain with the same options, so I'd expect them to be the same.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % diff good_hello bad_hello\n[no output here]\n\nIndeed, diff says they are. xattr says they both had no extended attributes, and mdls says they only differ in their names and certain timestamps:\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % diff good_mdls bad_mdls   \n1,2c1,2\n< _kMDItemDisplayNameWithExtensions      = \"good_hello\"\n< kMDItemContentCreationDate             = 2020-12-14 00:41:15 +0000\n---\n> _kMDItemDisplayNameWithExtensions      = \"bad_hello\"\n> kMDItemContentCreationDate             = 2020-12-14 00:39:07 +0000\n4c4\n< kMDItemContentModificationDate         = 2020-12-14 00:41:15 +0000\n---\n> kMDItemContentModificationDate         = 2020-12-14 00:39:07 +0000\n13c13\n< kMDItemDateAdded                       = 2020-12-14 00:41:23 +0000\n---\n> kMDItemDateAdded                       = 2020-12-14 00:40:55 +0000\n15c15\n< kMDItemDisplayName                     = \"good_hello\"\n---\n> kMDItemDisplayName                     = \"bad_hello\"\n17,18c17,18\n< kMDItemFSContentChangeDate             = 2020-12-14 00:41:15 +0000\n< kMDItemFSCreationDate                  = 2020-12-14 00:41:15 +0000\n---\n> kMDItemFSContentChangeDate             = 2020-12-14 00:39:07 +0000\n> kMDItemFSCreationDate                  = 2020-12-14 00:39:07 +0000\n26c26\n< kMDItemFSName                          = \"good_hello\"\n---\n> kMDItemFSName                          = \"bad_hello\"\n\ncodesign -dv also returns the same for each binary, with the exception of the Executable field. Strange! And every stranger: after I restart the computer, they both work.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./bad_hello\nhello.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./good_hello\nhello.\n\nAfter learning that code signs sometimes \"break\" and need to be corrected by \"copying the binary and re-signing it\", I make a fresh version of bad_hello and try it out. Actually, I find something more mysterious: it's enough to just copy the file.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./bad_hello\nzsh: killed     ./bad_carm\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % cp bad_hello some_random_new_path\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./some_random_new_path \nhello.\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % mv some_random_new_path bad_hello\ncgadski@ChristophersMBP hello % ./bad_hello\nhello.\n\nMy questions are: what could the IDE be doing to break my binary in this way? (It claims to just be invoking the same toolchain command, cargo build in this case.) And, what is it about the original bad_hello that warrants a SIGKILL?\n\nA: All binaries run on M1 need to be code signed. It can be an ad-hoc signature, and the first party toolchain will perform the necessary step, but other tools may not.\n\nthe operating system will enforce that any executable must be signed with a valid signature before it’s allowed to run. There isn’t a specific identity requirement for this signature: a simple ad-hoc signature issued locally is sufficient, which includes signatures which are now generated automatically by the linker.\n\n\nThis new policy doesn’t apply to translated x86 binaries running under Rosetta, nor does it apply to macOS 11 running on Intel platforms.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-universal-apps-beta-release-notes\nYou can apply a signature on a binary with codesign using -s (sign):\ncodesign -s - /path/to/binary\n\nYou can see whether a binary has a code signature using -d (display contents):\ncodesign -dv /path/to/binary\n\nThe diff tool won't display any difference since the files are identical, but the signature will mean the binary runs.\n$ echo foo > a\n$ echo foo > b\n\n$ codesign -dv a\na: code object is not signed at all\n$ codesign -dv b\nb: code object is not signed at all\n\n$ codesign -s - a\n$ codesign -dv a\nExecutable=/Users/user/a\nIdentifier=a-f1d2d2f924e986ac86fdf7b36c94bcdf32beec15\nFormat=generic\nCodeDirectory v=20100 size=187 flags=0x2(adhoc) hashes=1+2 location=embedded\nSignature=adhoc\nInfo.plist=not bound\nTeamIdentifier=not set\nSealed Resources=none\nInternal requirements count=0 size=12\n\n$ diff a b\n$ echo $?\n0\n\n", "Q: How to assign latitude & longitude to a photo \"Location\" in Photos 6?

I tried using lsof but not sure if I find something that's using disk3. What am I missing?\n\nA: It seems like you have confused some things:\nminicom is a program that will allow you to communicate with for example a different computer running Linux over a serial connection.\n/dev/disk3 is a device node on your computer that refers to a physical block device (i.e. for example a hard drive or an SSD).\nIt does not make sense to ask minicom to communicate with an SSD disk.

It was slower and I thought it was because of many apps. I formatted it and use essential apps but it has not made it faster. Last year I had its battery changed as it was draining the battery too fast.\nThe claim that Apple is purposely doing the phone slow, seems to be true? What is the way around to make my phone faster as not even the search would show up if I want to find an app.\n\nA: The claim you refer about Apple purposely making the phone slow is one of these things that can seem both true and false depending on your point of view.\nThe short version of that story is that the battery in your phone is a wearpart - and as it wears down it will loose capacity and perform worser. At a certain point the battery is weakened so much that you risk the phone just spontaneously turning off as the battery cannot supply the necessary power. At that point Apple applies \"performance management\", which essentially means making the CPU a bit slower in order to consume less power and prevent the phone from turning off unexpectedly.\nYou can disable this behavior from Settings > Battery > Battery Health. It will display the following text if performance management is applied:\n\n\"This iPhone has experienced an unexpected shutdown because the\nbattery was unable to deliver the necessary peak power. Performance\nmanagement has been applied to help prevent this from happening again.\nDisable…\"\n\nYou can disable performance management to ensure the CPU is run at full speed again. However, it will automatically be turned on again, if the phone is unexpectedly powered off due to battery problems.\nEssentially if your current battery is worn down, you want to replace the battery to fix this problem.\nHowever, if your previous battey was worn down and performance management applied - and you replaced the battery without disabling performance management again, then you can simply disable it to regain performance. If you used an official, authorized repair shop, they should have done this for you as part of the battery replacement though.\nAll in all the \"truthiness\" of the claim now depends on whether you think an slightly throttled iPhone is faster than a non-throttled iPhone that might turn off at the most unfortunate time.\n", "Q: Is there a FileVault compatible 3rd party Bluetooth keyboard?

I have a late 2021 unibody Mac Mini, upgraded to Catalina. For some time I have had problems where the monitor will not wake up from sleep even though the Mac is running - I think it's a known bug in the hardware/firmware.\nRecently I thought I had solved this buy setting the screen to never turn off:\n\nI thought it was working but recently I am coming back to my Mac after several hours and frequently I turn the monitor on with its own power button to find the same problem. Every time I have to hard reboot the thing.\nHow can the screen still be put to sleep when told not to? How can I prevent it?\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nI think this has been helping with my 2018 MacMini (on Catalina) display wake problems. Standby is different from sleep, and not in the Settings GUI. standby 0 will make sure your Mac never goes into hibernation. (That command must be entered in the terminal, and will ask for your password. You must be using an administrator account, or one on which sudo has been enabled.)\nThere are also two workarounds for this that may be helpful.\n\n*\n\n*Always turn the monitor on first, before waking the Mac (touching keyboard or mouse).\n\n\n*If you get the black screen, try putting the Mac to sleep and waking it again in a few seconds. You can put it in sleep by moving the mouse to the “sleep” corner set up in System Preferences, or with a key combination like Cmd-Option-Eject or Cmd-Option-Power (varies with keyboard type).

I regularly get interrupted in watching and listening to video by the volume randomly getting lowered without me asking for it. I get a system notification telling me \"the volume was lowered\", telling me it's protecting my hearing based on the last 7 days of use. I've never been asked about enabling such a feature.\nI have already disabled what relevant items I can find under Sound & Haptics, which is given as the source of the notification. It apparently doesn't matter though because it's not being respected.\nHow can I make this stop?\niPhone 8, iOS 14.2\n\nA: Update: See @Andreas' answer below - iOS 14.4 addresses this issue by allowing the user to specify what kind of device are they listening to. The loud volume notification features still cannot be turned off, but with the right settings, the notification will no longer lower volume automatically. I am currently on iOS 14.4 with iPhone 8 Plus in EU region and I can confirm that I can set my BT devices as external speakers or car stereos, so that they do not have their volume lowered.\n-- Original answer:\nIn addition to @grg's response it is worth noting that this feature doesn't work properly at least in following circumstances:\n\n*\n\n*You are using your phone in a car, where bluetooth car radio is registering itself to the iPhone as bluetooth headphones.\n\n*You are using non-Apple headphones.\n\n*You are using home appliances, such as external bluetooth speakers, which register to the iPhone as bluetooth headphones.\n\n*You have a hearing disability and need to set high listening volume in order to hear anything. You currently have no way to listen to music (or anything, actually), since iPhone will automatically lower the volume.\n\nIn these cases, iPhone will determine you are listening to music too loud and will turn the volume down. This cannot be turned off. The screen in your Sound & Haptics setting screen explicitly states these notifications cannot be turned off. This feature was introduced as part of iOS 14, but the inability to turn it off was introduced in iOS 14.2.\nI can confirm the above scenarios from my own experience with JBL external speaker and bluetooth receiver I use in my car.\nSome users and articles claim that this feature is based on legal requirement in EU and elsewhere. I reside in EU and I was only able to find EU recommendation on hearing protection in mobile devices. I couldn't, however, find any regulation that would make it mandatory for phones to have mandatory automatic volume controllers that can't be turned off. Follow-up discussion is available at Apple forums. This change has arguably created massive amounts of e-waste, since every BT gadget from AliExpress that allows you to use bluetooth in your car has been rendered useless, as well as many, if not most, external speakers and sound appliances on the market currently.\nI have no idea why anyone is defending this or why anyone would think I am too incompetent do decide for myself how loud I should listen to music.

The terminal app is located in the Applications folder under Utilities. To make it open in one click you can drag the Terminal application to the dock and add it there. Then whenever you click on the Terminal app in the dock it will launch. This will not give you root access. The terminal will open a window to your user's directory.

(The OP refers to the Mac Startup Manager as the \"boot menu\".)\n\n*\n\n*Method 1: Create folders, copy files and rename files from the linux installation so the Linux will appear in the Mac Startup Manager.  This may not be possible will all Linux installations. The main problem with this method is that the Linux installation does not know of these changes. So future updates to Linux may cause an unstable boot environment.\n\n*Method 2: Basically this is the same as Method 1 except instead of harvesting files from the Linux installation, the necessary files are taken from the download of the rEFInd Boot Manger.\n\nIn the case of Kali Linux, the steps to implement Method 1 are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS.\n\n\n*Mount the EFI volume. Open a Terminal application window and enter the command given below.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\n\n\n*Create folders, copy files and rename files. Enter the following commands in the Terminal application window.\nmkdir -p /Volumes/EFI/EFI/BOOT\ncp /Volumes/EFI/EFI/kali/grubx64.efi /Volumes/EFI/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi\n\n\n\n*Unmount the EFI volume. Enter the command given below.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nThe steps to implement Method 2 are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS.\n\n\n*Use Safari to download rEFInd. Be default, the download should automatically unzip to the ~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.12.0 folder.\n\n\n*Mount the EFI volume. Open a Terminal application window and enter the command given below.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\n\n\n*Create folders, copy files and rename files.

The installation procedure outlined by the OP seems to followed those of Offensive Security, but did not finish with the installation of rEFInd. The OP might consider continuing the installation by starting with the instructions in the section titled \"Installing rEFInd using Kali Linux\".\n\nA: macOS boot manager, on my system at least, only has the ability to select macOS and a bootcamp installation if present.\nIf you want to manage installations of operating systems outside of Apple's supported installation methods you'll need a boot manager such as refind.\n", "Q: M1 Mac clean install, getting stuck at \"Create a computer account\" I wanted to do a clean install on my shiny new M1 MacBook Pro, running macOS 11.1. I booted into recovery mode and navigated to disk utility, click my Macintosh HD entry, erase, then erase volume group.\nReformatting done, I selected \"Reinstall macOS Big Sur.\" This progressed normally, and I was eventually greeted with setup assistant, asking me to select a language.\nEverything works normally, up until I reach the \"Create a computer account\" dialog. No matter what information I enter here, the setup assistant freezes for 5-10 minutes [1]. It eventually reports that creating the account failed, with no further information. It asks me to try again - if I try to use the same short or full account name, it complains that the short or full name is in use and to select something else. If I change the full and short names and try again, the same thing occurs.\nIf I forcibly shut down the machine at this point and reboot, I am greeted with a normal login menu - e.g. no setup assistant. The accounts that I tried to create using the setup assistant are all listed, but I am unable to log into any of them - seems the password might be set to something other than what I specified.\nIf during the setup process I signed into iCloud (I have tried with and without signing in), I am given the option to reset the account password using my iCloud account - but this does not work, it shakes a bit as if the iCloud password is wrong. (The iCloud password works perfectly fine on another machine.)\nI would write the whole thing off as a glitch, but it is 100% reproducible (on this machine, at least - I am afraid to try my existing machine for the moment). That is, erasing the hard drive and restarting the entire process results in the same errors. If there was a hardware issue, doesn't it seem more likely that we'd run into different set of problems each time?\nSo, wall of text finished: has anyone run into this, or have any advice on debugging?\nI am on attempt 5+ at the moment.\n[1] I can still bring up the Force Quit dialog, and adjust brightness/etc using the Touch Bar.\n\nA: Use the other machine, you indicate that you have, to restore the M1 MacBook Pro M1 fully.\nYou can find Apple's instructions on doing that here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-2/apdd5f3c75ad/mac\nIt consists of the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Install Apple Configurator 2 on your working Mac.\n\n\n*Connect the two Macs using a USB-C cable. On the non-working MacBook Pro it needs to go into the left-hand side port that is nearest the back of the Mac.\n\n\n*Run Apple Configurator 2\n\n\n*Put the non-working MacBook Pro in DFU mode by pressing the power button and holding it down and simultaneously pressing and holding the right shift key, the left option key and the left control key - all for 10 seconds.\n\n\n*After 10 seconds release all keys except the power button.\n\n\n*The MacBook Pro should now appear in Apple Configurator 2. Select it and click Actions > Restore.\nAfter the restore process is finished, you can setup macOS as normally - including the user accounts and passwords.\n\nA: paraphrasing @Remiks' answer (thanks Remiks - your writeup got me unstuck!). Remiks reports:\nApple Support shared this alternative to their published steps\nIt relies on recovery tools, not Configurator.\nUpsides over the published Apple support steps:\n\n*\n\n*requires no 2nd machine or external drive\n\n*requires no new software (just the Mac OS already on your machine; no downloads of any kind)\n\n*works reliably (whereas Apple support warns configurator 2 is flakey)\n\nCrazy idea, but should these become the official steps? Anyone aware of a situation actually requiring Configurator?\nsteps to follow:\n\n*\n\n*shut down your computer\n\n*remove the computer from any iCloud accounts (thanks for the edit, @abbaf33f)\n\n*unplug any ethernet cables (thanks @davidgiga1993; probably also best to unplug any peripherals)\n\n*hold the power button until the \"options\" icon shows\n\n*select the \"options\" icon\n\n*when next screen loads, select menu item to launch terminal\n\n*in terminal type \"resetpassword\" and hit enter\n\n*when a reset password box appears, reveal a new menu by clicking somewhere off to the side of the reset password box (thanks for the edit, @brendan-duke!)\n\n*select \"Recovery Utilities\" then \"erase Mac\"; in new pop up confirm option to erase Mac\n\n*once erased, exit back to recover\n\n*reinstall the operating system\n\n*once installed, create the account.\n\nRemiks' reported result matches mine: this fix works on the first try.\nOn the other hand, the official apple steps failed repeatedly for me, and two Apple Sr. Advisors warned me as they attempted to assist that the published instructions were unreliable (yep, they were also frustrated that the Apple-supplied steps failed try after try).\n\nA: As of Feb '21 things are easier. I was able to boot into the config menu and after erasing \"Macintosh HD\" with Disk Utility, got the error that no users were available to give permission to reinstall like before. Figured I was headed to DFU mode and Configurator 2, I have done it before and it works. Instead I tried erasing \"Data\" also. After that I had to activate the machine again with an Apple ID, but then reinstalling Big Sur from the network proceeded.\nIt may make a difference that I had turned off the secure boot option before erasing \"Macintosh HD\"; don't know for sure.\n", "Q: How to add characters (accents) to the press and hold character picker in macOS Big Sur? In macOS Big Sur, there is a very useful feature for people like me who need to write in multiple languages, which pops up a small menu of additional characters when you hold down a letter.\nFor instance, when I hold down the letter ''E'', I get:\n\nThis is great when I'm writing in French for example. However right now I need to write something in Czech; however, the Czech letter ě (looks like the 3rd letter in the popup with the accent flipped) does not appear in the popup.\nIs there a way to tell macOS Big Sur to include Czech or other additional characters in those popups?\nNote: I do not want to use the Czech keyboard layout; I found switching layouts for each language is somewhat unpractical.\n\nA: This is to address productivity and not specific question.\nIf I am not mistaken then czech language includes letters like á, č, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ř, š, ť, ú, ů, ý, ž. So ě is small subset of root problem: need to write in czech (or any other language with special characters).\nKeeping this in mind there are several approaches which one can pursue to address the root problem.\n\nI found switching layouts for each language is somewhat unpractical.\n\nThere is built-in shortcut (which may or may not need to enabled/set up): System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources > 'Select the previous input source', 'Select next source in input menu'\nAfter adding needed layout(s) and enabling shortcut it is very simple to switch layouts without need to raise your hand from keyboard. If one is familiar with language specific layout IMHO it is by far the simplest solution.\nThere is also selection under 'Input Sources' labeled 'Automatically switch to a document's input source' which can be used to automate switching.\nAlternatively, there is keyboard layout in input sources called 'ABC extended'. If one uses this then there are handy shortcuts for different accents. NB! these shortcuts may or may not conflict with 'personal' shortcuts set up.\nHachek caron:\n\n*\n\n*⌥ + V,  followed by letter (like c, e, n, r, s, z or special cases l and d) -> č, ě, ň, ř, š, ž, ľ, ď\n\nAcute:\n\n*\n\n*⌥ + E followed by letter (like a, e, i, o, u, y) -> á, é, í, ó, ú, ý\n\nU-ring:\n\n*\n\n*⌥ + K, followed by letter (like u) -> ů\n\nAlternatively, there is 'Character viewer' which pop-up window can be invoked with  ⌃ + ⌘ + SPACE.

Since upgrading, I am unable to unlock the \"lock\" in the System Preferences panels that require it (the window \"jiggles\" even with the right password) and I am unable to set up Touch ID (after entering the password it doesn't prompt me to register a new fingerprint).\nI saw in other answers that others used the resetpassword utility from Recovery mode, so I did this too. The problem persisted even after changing the password. The linked answer recommends creating a new admin user, but I cannot do that as I can't unlock the \"padlock\" in System Preferences to do so. I also reset NVRAM to no avail.\nUltimately, I chose to reinstall Big Sur from recovery, but entering the password to unlock the disk does not \"do\" anything, as in, the password entry window simply fades out but the installation does not move forward and I am still able to click on the \"unlock\" button again.\nI was wondering if anyone knew how I can solve this issue.

I tried to delete the source using xattr -c\nIt seems as if the information is in the file and not added attributes are from the system itself ...\nDoes anyone know how to delete or change the metadata on PDF files?\n\nA: Meta information and attributes is complex thing and I am not qualified to cover it extensively. Nevertheless. Distinction should be made between:\n\n*\n\n*meta information in files (usually displayed in GUI like Finder)\n\n*Extended File Attributes\n\nIt is my understanding that question is about meta information one can see using ⌘ + i in Finder and xattr is not suited for that (it's for Extended File Attributes).\nIf you remove extended attributes with xattr -c my_file.pdf it may seem that all attributes are removed (xattr my_file.pdf returns nothing). However, Finder displays meta information in tact.\nBuilt-in mdls lists the metadata attributes for the specified file. The problem with mdls is that attributes are in MacOS plist format which not match names of attributes one can see in Finder using ⌘ + i. Additionally it also displays mixed selection of meta information and extended file attributes as well as fact it allows listing but not editing.\nFor deleting pdf meta information one can use exiftool and/or qpdf (both are not built in).\nTo remove all meta information in my_file.pdf using exiftool:\nexiftool -all= my_file.pdf\n\nIt removes meta information, but displays warning:\nWarning: [minor] ExifTool PDF edits are reversible.

The PDF file format itself contains metadata for the Title, Creator, Author, encoding software used, creation Date and more. This is separate from the data that macOS can append to a file on its disks.\nVarious third-party apps, like Acrobat, PDFPen Pro, etc, provide dialogs to edit this data. You can also modify it with Automator.\nYou'd need to create a workflow that takes a PDF as input, and then changes the metadata to something else, which could be \" \".\n\nNote that it doesn't contain 'your OS', but the version of MacOS that made the PDF.\nNote that you can't change the Encoding Software value.\n\nA: You can look at ExifCleaner ... despite the name, it also cleans non-EXIF metadata, e.g., from PDF files.\nDescription from documenation:\n\nDesktop app to clean metadata from images, videos, PDFs, and other files.\n\nSupports:\n\n*\n\n*Windows, Mac, and Linux\n\n*Image formats such as PNG, JPG, GIF, and TIFF\n\n*Video formats such as M4A, MOV, and MP4\n\n*PDF documents (partial)\n\n*Batch-processing\n\nInstallation:\n# see https://exifcleaner.com/ for other installation options\n# see https://github.com/szTheory/exifcleaner#readme for Github repo\nbrew install exifcleaner\n\nUsage:\nEasy.

Is there a working keyboard shortcut here?\n\nEDIT: Note the problem applies to Monterey as well\n\nA: The new destructive action doesn't have a keyboard shortcut by default.

I have read articles where people say its okay but I cant grasp the full picture consequences of what will happen if I do. I just wanted to hear from someone before moving on any farther.\n\nA: Clearing any cache, unless it has gone seriously awry, is a very temporary stop-gap.\nIt doesn't hurt anything really, but the cache will simply refill next time you run whatever process needed to cache the data. Cache is there to prevent excessive access times - it's right there when your machine needs it rather than on the other side of the world on some server.\nClearing it will temporarily reduce your data footprint, in extremis if you need space for a large download/install, which Xcode is, but is not a permanent solution to the fact that your drive is critically low on space.\nGeneral rule of thumb is to always keep 10-15% free at all times, so you really need to farm something out to other storage.\nFor further reading, I'd have a look at How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?\n", "Q: Trying to modify keys to left and right arrow keys but doesn't work I have this Json file and it does not apply to the left_arrow key.

The monitor LED panel brightness stays the same, but the colours get darker as you lower the brightness in Lunar which mimics a brightness change.\nI've written about how that works here if anyone's curious about it: The journey to controlling external monitors on M1 Macs\nLunar should fallback to Gamma automatically if DDC is detected unresponsive, but you can also force that fallback by disabling Hardware Controls in the Lunar monitor settings\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of Lunar\n", "Q: GFortran compiler error on Mac OS Big Sur I am trying to compile a hello world program in fortran on Mac OS Big Sur.

My understanding is that with APFS, volumes exist inside containers, and the volumes all grow as much as needed, as long as there is space in the container.\nBut I want to limit the space for the volumes. I have a 2TB disk with two volumes - one for Time Machine and one for general storage. I don't want the Time Machine volume to take the entire physical disk. Sadly, there is no way (in macOS 11 Big Sur) to delete Time Machine snapshots, so I need to limit its space by limiting the size of the volume.\n\nA: When creating an APFS volume, you can set a quota. In Disk Utility, in the sheet to create a new volume, choose Size Options and set a Quota Size.\n\nThe optional quota size limits how much storage this volume can allocate.\n\nThis can't be added or changed for an existing volume.\n\nA: Yes it's possible, but not by the Disk Utility, because you can't set a role to your Volume by this way.\nYou can find my solution at this link : https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/419848/415185\n\nA: There is no way to limit individual APFS volumes that are used with Time Machine as per macOS 11.1.

For example, there are several places where long-pressing does nothing, any one of which could become a useful forward delete key.\nHere's a short list (illustrated in the image below): the shift key, the 123 key, the autotype area above the keyboard, the space below the spacebar, letters like \"p\" which have no long-press action.\n\nIs there no way to program this, come up with an app, or a customized keyboard? It's hard for me to believe that with all the brilliant minds out there no one can come up with a better way. By the way I've wanted to have a forward delete key about five times while writing this post!\nPlease don't respond if you have a negative answer (which can never be proved). Let's wait for someone brilliant out there to share with us.\n\nA: I don't believe there is an option with the built-in keyboard. The only way you could forward delete is to connect an external keyboard and hold down the fn key and press delete key.\nAlso, this same question was asked here and here on this site.\n", "Q: Safari (iPhone, MacBook) gives NSURLErrorDomain:-1017 I face the issue that Safari returns the error: cannot parse response (NSURLErrorDomain:-1017)\nI tested it on different iPhones and one MacBook.\niPhone XS & 11 (iOS 14.3).

I need to use a DNS server that serves on port 5353, how do I specify the port in the system DNS settings?\n\nA: [Edited]\nYou cannot. Most all DNS clients expect that the DNS server will be listening on port 53.  All DNS servers run on port 53, period, end of discussion. Yet you can run them on alternate ports but the only operating system that allows a DNS client to connect directly to a custom DNS server on a non-standard port is OpenBSD. That means every other OS will have difficulty connecting directly to your DNS server running on port 5353 and will fail.\nYou may be doing something unusual such as dnsmasq or unbound, etc. Or you are on a network that restricts port 53 which breaks Internet standards. You must then setup a router or perhaps a proxy redirect to be the IP address that receives the DNS client connections on port 53 and forwards / redirects to the actual DNS server running on port 5353. You may be able to get around restrictions via VPN or SSH port forwarding.\nWould need much more detail to answer the question any further.\n", "Q: Changing Bootcamp Partition ID on Terminal in Recovery Mode I have an iMac 5K 2017 running MacOS Big Sur and Windows 10 and the problem is a little bit tricky:\nAfter I resized my Bootcamp with AOMEI Partition Assistance and restarted it, it couldn't run MacOS(it showed prohibitory sign) and needed to be recovered.\nIn Disk Utility on Recovery Mode, the Fusion Drive had been separated into HDD and SSD. Except Bootcamp partition, the other partitions are gone and cannot be erased or splited.\nTherefore I restarted to Windows and tried to fix it with gdisk, but I accidentally changed the partition ID on wrong disk(I changed Bootcamp partition ID into APFS as shown in fig.1)\n\nfig.1 Weird partitions\nNow I am not albe to boot both systems, only Recovery Mode. I am trying to change APFS back to Microsoft Basic Data of the Bootcamp partition on Terminal in it, but it always shows \"command not found.\"REF1 REF2\nIs there any way to fix it? Because I didn't backup my Windows(Mac is OK to be erased)\n\nA: \nThe commands given in this answer should be entered while booted to macOS Recovery. Older versions of macOS (OS X) may require booting macOS Recovery from the Internet or a macOS installation USB flash drive. Also, some commands may need to be preceded by a sudo. The instructions given below will probably fail when hybrid partitioning is being used.\n\nThe command provided by macOS to change a partition type GUID is gpt. However, this command works differently from gdisk in that gdisk is interactive and gpt is not. Also, the gpt command requires removal of the partition from the GPT in order to change the partition type GUID. Once removed, the partition can be added back to the GPT with the correct partition type GUID. This removal and addition does not alter the contents of the partition.\nThe command below can be used to partially view the current contents of the GPT for the drive with the identifier disk0.\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nThe commands below can be used to remove from the GPT the partition with the identifier disk0s2.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0\n\nThe commands below can be used to add to the GPT the previously removed partition. This partition will be given the Windows GUID type. Replace <start> and <size> with the integer values shown in the output of the command gpt -r show /dev/disk0 for the row with an index of 2.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b <start> -s <size> -t windows /dev/disk0\n\n\nNote: The integers used in identifiers do not have to match the index values used by the GPT and gpt command. In this case, the 2 used in disk0s2 probably refers to the partition with index value of 2 in the GPT.\n\n", "Q: How to execute pre-defined JavaScript function in AppleScript and pass data to JavaScript In my AppleScript, I want to pass a list of keys to a website's client-side, then query the data on the backend, and get the response and re-render the client-side.

It works with up to 100mbps, and it shows in Network as \"USB 10/100LAN\", but I know it can do up to 1000mbps, but when trying to add + a new interface, the \"USB 10/100/1000 LAN\" does not appear as an option. The rest of the dongle works. Ethernet adapter works up to that speed.\nHow can I make the Mac recognise the full speed of the dongle, namely connect under a \"USB 10/100/1000 LAN\" connection and actually run full speed?\nIt says in the box 1000mbps.\n\nI had another adapter, different model, that stopped working, that did show as \"USB 10/100/1000 LAN\", and did run close to 1000mbps in tests.\n\nIt reaches 1000mbps in other laptops and the seller has confirmed other clients, presumably using other laptops or OSs, don't have the problem.\nIt's a non-branded dongle. I have tried installing Realtek drivers but it didn't solve the problem.\n\n\nA: Judging from your screenshots it seems like the LAN cable is not directly plugged into your Mac, instead:\nLAN cable → USB 2.0 Hub→ 4-port USB 2.1 Hub → USB 3.1 MBP Controller\nUSB 2 spec does not allow for high speed data connection like 1GBit/s. As mentioned in the system report, the maximum speed is 480MBit/s. Therefore you can't establish a 1000MBit/s connection.\nAs long as you have one device in this connection tree that is not at least capable of USB 3.0 speeds, you will not get the faster 1GBit/s speed on your LAN connection.\n\nEdit: There is another faster 4-port USB 3.1 Hub being mentioned in the system report. I think that since your dongle has so many ports, it also has two different controllers that are being recognized by the Mac and shown as separates Hubs, although they are one dongle.\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur - How do I disable keyboard backlight permanently?

Something else is needed to impact Safari and the App Store conn3cting to resources outside your mac.\nNetworking, dns and firewall software are the things that typically impact multiple apps, but the best strategy might be to pick one app and one target and isolate / troubleshoot that and then repeat with the next app or the next online service.\n\nA: In case someone runs into the same issue, here were the steps I performed to solve the issue.\nOn system report, under applications, I identified all 32 bit applications and deleted them.\nThat gave me back safari for a session (stopped working after restart), but still overall icloud and mail wouldnt connect.\nAfter restart I disabled wifi, created a new network location, and set the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and renew my dhcp lease.

Can I use a Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable?\nAccording to Apple:\n\nThunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 are not the same as Mini DisplayPort . They have the same shape, but use different symbols on the cable and port. However, this port does support Mini DisplayPort for video output, so you can use a Mini DisplayPort cable to connect a Mini DisplayPort display.\n\nIt seems you can, but I have had trouble with Mac-related compatibility before, so I want to make sure.\nThank you.\n\nA: I assume you want to use this with a DisplayPort compatible monitor:\n\n*\n\n*Yes you can. As you quote:\n\n\nHowever, [Thunderbolt 2] does support Mini DisplayPort for video output\n\nThis is definitely correct and I can confirm that this works on a similar machine. The cable you show should work as intended.\n\nWhat doesn't work is using a Mini DisplayPort as Thunderbolt 2, e.g. for transferring data to a hard drive.

Then you would need to know how you send an email as text, which you could easily find with a quick internet search.\nNot being an Android user there MAY be a way to send an email as a text message so it is received in the Android equivalent of messages.app on iOS. But for the answer to that question you will need to look elsewhere.\n\nA: If you are referring to sending a text message like a SMS to someone else via an e-mail address, then the answer is usually no. Emails is usually not meant for this kind of use, but apparently at least in the US it may be possible. Check SteveChambers answer about that.\nYour confusion most likely comes from Apples messages app, that allows you to send messages (similar to Telegram) to devices without a phone number. This, however, is restricted to Apple products like Macs and iPads.\nThe easiest and most obvious way for you to communicate would be via email. You have to have an email address configured in an email client (the preinstalled one on iOS is fine) and from there you can send an email to the recipient. However, the recipient needs a way of accessing their email, like an email client app or through a browser.\n", "Q: New iMac freezing every click I bought this iMac 6 months ago, model late2019, with 64gb RAM and fusion HD 3TB\nI ran all the utility tool and I get a lot of MT mapping warnings when i run the First Aid, but they don't seem to be critical error\nI feel my computer started to get slower/freeze after a message about Adobe Creative cloud file being corrupted or what not... was an unusual message but i just ignored it until the mac was impossible to use, literally freezing for a minute every click.\nI wonder if installing bigSur will fix everything or should I simply erase everything and reinstall the original OS, then upgrade to bigsur and reinstall all the apps (pain in the butt:))\nthanks\n\nA: First things first: Always backup your files!\n\nI would start narrowing down the issue, i.e. trying to find the actual cause.\n\n*\n\n*Run First Aid multiple times on your hard drive and see if it is able to repair the disk.

There was a point in time where I had 500GB of unusable free space that I couldn't allocate to my functional partition of Big Sur!\nNot too long ago I installed the Mac OS Big Sur Developer Beta on my computer. It was alright – a few issues here and there, but nonetheless not bad for a beta. After Big Sur was officially released, I wanted to get out of the Beta and remain on the public version of Big Sur. Of course, that's no easy task. So what I decided to do was partition my drive (500 GB / 500 GB), install the public version of Big Sur on the new partition, and then move all my files over – It worked! Now it was time to resize the new partition after formatting the old one so that my new partition was the full 1 TB of available space – and that is where this tutorial will help. For some reason, with Big Sur, I was unable to change the size of the Partition. I tried every single command-line google had to offer – I even went as far as using Recovery to run GPT commands. The furthest I got from that was the ability to recover the \"Free Space\" and use the 1st partition as a drive, but it was still considered separate from my main Big Sur partition.\nWhat do I do to retain my entire storage in 1 partition?\n\nA: Found a Solution!\nWhat you'll need:\n\n*\n\n*A Second Mac (With enough storage to backup your files)\n\n*A Bootable USB Big Sur Drive (Apple has great docs on how to make that)\n\n*A Thunderbolt cable (and respective adapters to establish a connection between the first (Problem Mac) and second Mac)\n\n*Time\n\nBefore you start just know that you will lose your preferences and installed Apps (Some apps may be transferred by the methods below). If you use Time Machine, you might be able to hold onto your preferences and Apps.\nYou may be able to use a time machine backup, but I haven't tested it. If you want to use a time machine backup, Mount your Troubled Mac (covered in Step 1) and then skip to Step 2.\nStep 1\nFrom the Troubled Mac: Turn off your issued Mac, then turn it on and immediately hold down 'T' on your keyboard. Plug in your thunderbolt cable.\nFrom the Second Mac: Plug in the other end of the thunderbolt cable, go to disk utility, find the Hardrive(s)/partitions of your troubled Mac, Right-click on all partitions and choose \"Mount\" – You may be asked to enter the password for the drives. Right click on the \"-Data\" drive and choose \"Show in Finder\". Navigate to your home directory where you'll find all your files.\nContinuing on the Second Mac: Make a new folder in a safe spot. Move over all your files from the issued Mac (\"Show in Finder\" Finder Window). Patiently wait until you have secured a copy of all your files on the Second Mac.\nStep 2\nThis step may be able to be completed from Recovery/Bootable Installer command-line. Not Tested\nFrom the Second Mac: Open up terminal and type in\ndiskutil list\n\nYou'll get a list of all the drives, including the attached Target Disk (Troubled Mac). Note the disk identifier of the troubled Mac (In my case it was disk3; yours may be different). With your Partitions still mounted through Disk Utility, type in the following command:\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk3 1 GPT HFS+ Untitled 100%\n\nThis will format the troubled mac's SSD/HDD to an HFS+ partition. Note: If you receive the \"Can't open\" error, double check that the troubled Mac is A) Mounted in Disk Utility and B) Not being used by another application such as a Recovery Program or Transferring Files!\nOnce completed, you'll see the new \"Untitled\" drive in Disk Utility, formatted as an HFS drive. Select the new \"Untitled\" drive in disk utility and click \"Erase\" along the top menu. Choose to erase as \"APFS\" (Don't choose encrypted) and Give it a nice title – How about \"Macintosh HD\". Click \"Erase\". You've fixed your hard drive Allocation/Partition Problem!\nStep 3\nFrom the Troubled Mac: Hold down the power button for 10 seconds to shut off the computer. Plug in the Bootable Installer USB. Turn on the Mac and hold down the \"Option\" key until you see the Bootable Drive. Select it. Install Mac OS Big Sur Public as normal. Set it up and Log yourself in. Wallah! A fresh Mac that is the full hard disk size!\nStep 4\nIf you are using a time machine backup, restore from Time Machine and you should be good to go!\n\nThere is a good video by 9to5mac on how to do this step if you are not using a time machine backup\n\nWith your newly formatted Mac still plugged into the Second Mac, go to System Preferences on Both Macs.\nOn Both Macs: go to network settings and click \"+\". Add a thunderbolt bridge connection. Note the IP address from the Second Mac.\nOn The Second Mac: Go back to Sharing Preferences. Check mark \"File Sharing\".\nOn The Newly Formatted Mac: Go to Finder. Hit\n\"Go\" in the top menu bar, then select \"Connect to Server\". Enter the IP address you noted from the Second Mac and hit \"Connect\". After a few moments you'll be asked to login, in which you'll enter the credentials for the Second Mac. The Second Mac should now be mounted as drive on the Newly Formatted Mac where you can move your files back over to their respective folders.\nFinished! If you've made it this far, I know you were as desperate as I was. I hope this was able to help a few of you – And for those of you that knew this, WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I NEEDED YOU?! Let me know if this worked out for you.

To be sure my ssd was totally clean including the efi partition, i zero'ed the drive with dd. Then, booted to internet recovery, which oddly booted up to Big Sur recovery even though i never upgraded to Big Sur. I decided to install Big Sur anyway via internet recovery, and after the install, i noticed that in \"About this mac\" as well as through a terminal command, that my serial number was labeled as \"unavailable\", and is no longer recognized in the MLB of the \"Mail logic board.\"\n\n*Furthermore, i noticed that my icloud automatically signed my mac out from my icloud interface in the settings panel on my iphone. I never signed myself out before erasing.\n\nEXPERIMENTS AND QUIRKS:\nOne more strange quirk is that apparantly, this somehow also deactivated all of apples DRM (digital rights management) for any of the apps that i had purchased. I concluded this, because after the clean install from internet recovery, I DID NOT SIGN INTO ICLOUD. Then, instead of importing my files with migration utility, i simply dragged and dropped my digitally purchased app store apps from my time-machine backup, onto my clean install. After removing time machine drive, i opened the apps, and low and behold, all of them worked perfectly without asking me to sign into icloud, or log into the app store. How is this possible?\nMY IDEAS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUE:\n\n*\n\n*Supposedly, once a certified apple technician burns a serial number into your logic board, it is impossible to remove unless you have specialized software that contacts apples servers with a registered signature and encryption key, and waits for apples servers to send authorization to write or remove the serial number from the logic board. Assuming that apples technology is impenetrable, then you would have to assume that someone stole apples special software and one of their keys, and used it on my logic board remotely to deserialize my mlb.\n\n\n*The other possibility, is that apples hardware and logic boards are flawed, and they can erase their oen serial numbers. other than that, im out of ideas.\nMY QUESTION:\n\n*\n\n*Can someone explain how i lost my serial number, and explain the weird quirks (missing drm, unauthorized deregistering my mac from icloud) that are happening as a consequnce?\n\n\n*Then, can someone please tell me how I can get my serial number burned back into the mlb so that i can use imessage on my mac again?\n\n\n*I found a website with some software called BlankBoard Serialzer at https://www.macintoshrepository.org/26584-blank-board-serializer?ns=1\nCould anyone tell me if this sofware is safe to use and if I should use it to re-burn my serial number into my mac?\nThanks for any help! Check screenshots below!\n\n\n\nA: Question 1a:\nWe don't know all the steps you have taken (and you may not remember all of them very clearly) in your reinstall.  So hard to say why.  The most common causes are some hardware change, but you say this does not apply in your case.  Of the steps you mention using dd is the only unusual step - I would have used Disk Utility in Internet Recovery.\nQuestion 1b:\nYou have already discovered that some Apple services require a valid serial number. iMessage and various DRM are tied to your serial number and UUID as well as Apple ID.  As an aside, loading a valid serial number is a tricky and important step in getting a Hackintosh to run iMessage.\nQuestion 2:\nThe best solution is to take the MBP to an Apple Store where they may well fix your problem for free - just say it happened during a macOS upgrade (which is true in your case).\nQuestion 3:\nThe Blank Board Serializer is an Apple tool and can be used to fix your Serial Number.  It is important to find the version which is compatible with your MBP - I can't help you there.\nHave a read of these three links which describe the process which must be following very carefully - the first one has lots of comments from those who have succeeded (or not) using this method.\nRoger Sen\nWhat causes Mac to lose its serial number\nHow to fix missing serial number\nWarnings:\n\n*\n\n*However you fix this (either via Apple or yourself) make very sure you enter the correct serial number belonging to your Mac.  You only get one chance to get it right.\n\n*If you do it yourself, be prepared that you might get it wrong and brick your MBP.\n\nAdditional warning:\n\n*\n\n*Read @DanRan's own solution and heed the warnings about the need to unregister the Mac and unauthorise from any services which have been used with the incorrect or blank serial number.\n\n\nA: The reasoning why this occurs is unknown to the general public. But the issue appears to be related to OS changes and unofficial hardware changes. As for a fix, if your Mac is still under warranty, take it to the Apple Store so they can correct the issue.\n\nA: For those who experience this problem, I partly solved the issue (which created a new issue) by doing the following:\nTHE SOLUTION:\nI took my mac to the Apple store, and showed them the missing serial number. The Apple Technician connected my mac to Apples servers and reflashed my logic board with the correct serial number right in front of my eyes all for the price of $0.00 without apple care or a warranty for my mac. So, the Apple Stores do have the proper software, means, and ability to reflash your serial number into your MBL if this issue happens to you.\nTHINGS TO CHECK BEFORE TAKING IT TO THE APPLE STORE:\nAfter I had the Apple store reflash my macbook pro with the original serial number, I encountered a new problem, that may not have occured if I took care of this issue BEFORE REFLASHING THE SERIAL NUMBER AT THE APPLE STORE.\nThe NEW Probem:\nReflashing the Macbook pro with the serial number (possibly) created a permanant issue in icloud. Now, when using the icloud web interface, my iphone, or my mac, i CANNOT REMOVE the Old macbook pro with the \"UKNOWN\" Serial number. This means, that when trying to reformat my newly flashed mac, and start from scratch, icloud somehow thinks my macbook is permanently logged in and will not de-register \"Macbook Pro: Unknown Serial number\" from icloud using any means or methodology. I have no idea if this issue existed before reflashing my mac serial number, but i believe it didnt. Therefore I suspect the issue comes from the fact that iCloud is detecting two of the exact same hardware and logic board configurations with different serial numbers.\nIF YOU ARE TAKING IN YOUR DESERIALIZED MAC to the APPLE STORE TO REFLASH THE SERIAL I would strongly suggest to do the following before hand:\n\n*\n\n*Unregister your mac with the \"UNKNOWN\" serial number from all off apple services including imessage, icloud, app store, itunes store, icloud, and any other apple service you can possibly think of. THEN Verify that your deserelized macbook pro DOES NOT SHOW UP in icloud from your phone, or from your icloud panel on another mac. If It DOES SHOW up after deregistering it form icloud, then you have the same problem, and should show this to the apple technician before reflashing the serial number onto your mac.\n\n*Be sure to de-authorize your mac from the iTunes store, and any other apple services. Note that de-authorized and unregistering are two different things. Do both, especially with itunes.\n\nIf you have the same issue, and these steps work for you please leave a comment so I can update the solution. Hopefully this helps anyone else out there.\n", "Q: TeX on Arm Infrastructure I am new to the macOS and the apple ecosystem in general.

Also, if I install using MacTeX+MacTeXUniversal and in April 2021 I want to upgrade will I have to delete everything and install from scratch?\n\nA: As it says on https://www.tug.org/mactex/aboutarm.html\n\nAfter installing MacTeX-2020-Universal, all front ends and the command line programs will automatically use Arm binaries on Arm machines and Intel binaries on Intel machines.\n\nso if you start from scratch and want a working TeX installation which runs natively just install the Universal package and you are all set. The remarks about the 2021 version providing full ARM support most probably refers to extended testing and maybe adapting some programs to make better use of ARM.\nAs for upgrading to 2021 next year, this will work the same way as before: The 2021 package will install into its own directory within /usr/local/texlive and you can then switch to the new version with the TeX Live Utility. Any user-installed styles and fonts are in /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local so they will remain available.\nPS: Using Homebrew has the advantage of updating TeXLive automatically whenever you update your Homebrew installation. OTOH Homebrew currently is still transitioning to ARM so IMHO it's better to install MacTeX directly and run tlmgr update --self; tlmgr update --all every few weeks to keep it updated.\n\nA: Regarding your question B:\nMacTeX is released in a new, official version once a year. I.e. MacTeX 2019, MacTeX 2020, etc.\nIn between these releases, development occurs - and various \"interim\" versions can be made at any time. The Universal package with ARM and Intel code is such an \"interim\" version.\nI.e. if you want the official version, which will most probably be the version that works best, fewest bugs and problems - you want the MacTeX 2020 version that is not universal.\nIf you want to something that runs faster and you're OK with getting an \"in-between\" version that hasn't been tested as well as the ordinary versions, then get the Universal version.\nIn any case upgrading to the new version next year is easy, and does not require you to start from scratch.\n", "Q: How to paste graphics image data to folders in finder If you right click and copy an image from Safari, Mail, etc. (or command-control-shift-4 to save screenshot to clipboard), certain apps support pasting (e.g., Mail, MS Word, etc.), but I can't paste the image to a folder in finder.\nIs there some way to override the default behavior, allowing me to paste to a folder, the aforementioned image data as a file using command-V? I don't really care what the file type is.\n\nREVERTED EDITS TO QUESTION: See accepted answer to original question below.\n\nA: As a workaround, you can open Preview and use File → New from Clipboard (cmd-N). Preview opens the clipboard data and you can save this as a file to the location you desire.\n\nA: Here are the steps to get something working (I asked a separate question to extend this solution so that it will work with CMD-V instead of CTRL-CMD-V):\n\n*\n\n*Install pngpaste using brew install pngpaste.\n\n\n*Make Automator Quick Action, and configure as:\n\nosascript -e 'set formattedDate to (do shell script \"date +'%Y-%m-%dat%H-%M-%S%p'\")' -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to set thePath to the quoted form of (POSIX path of (insertion location as alias) & formattedDate & \".png\")' -e 'if ((clipboard info) as string) contains TIFF picture then do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/pngpaste \" & thePath' -e 'if ((clipboard info) as string) does not contain TIFF picture then tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using control down'\n\n\n\n*Save and close.\n\n*Assign a shortcut to trigger the service:\n\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY: If you want to paste any file just as normal, use CMD-V and if you want to paste a screenshot or image from the internet use CTRL-CMD-V.\n", "Q: Apple Automator (or similar): performing workflow triggered by shutdown? I was thinking about turning my desktop into a git repository that automatically syncs with BitBucket. The idea is that, periodically, the desktop is synced as well as automatically before it shuts down, i.e.: shutdown -> sync -> when sync is finished, actually shut down.\nIs it possible to do something like that? Just an idea that I had a second ago but I couldn't find the right tools to implement it right away.\n\nA: Triggering events on shut down is unlikely to be reliable. macOS is not designed to interrupt or pause the shut down process.\nIf a user is logged in, graphical applications can inadvertently cancel or delay shut down. This behaviour typically occurs when a modal dialog is shown for an unsaved document. In this situation, the preferred solution is to auto-save the work and restore it on next launch; this is considered better than interrupting shut down.\nBetter to sync periodically or in reaction to changes to a set of files.\n", "Q: How can I tell Apple iCloud to forget or delete system configuration settings? I've noticed that whenever I setup a new iMac or MacBook, that small system configurations from older/other systems are copied over to my new system as soon as I login to iCloud.  While I like iCloud for syncing files across desktops, I don't necessarily want each of my systems to share the same configurations.  It's a granular as the speed of my pointer or the touch settings on the trackpad.  With a couple iMac's and a physically different layout in my offices, this shared configuration is obtrusive and I frequently need to revise it.  Is there a way to enjoy some iCloud features on one Apple ID account, but not have every system configuration shared?\nI've noticed other settings sync in the past, but \"Tap to click\" and \"Tracking speed\" are the most annoying.  On one of my physical desks, I've my trackpad off to the side like \"normal\" people :P. At my other office, I've the trackpad and keyboard in a container laid out like a MacBook so bumping it with my palm causes a tap-to-click, so I have to turn it off. If I turn it back on on the other system, it updates both.\n\n\nA: iCloud does not sync settings like mouse pointer speed. If these settings are appearing on a new system, it means you have implemented an alternative syncing method (inadvertently or not).\n", "Q: Can I obtain the web browsing history from my in-app browsers on iOS and iPadOS? Every week or two, time permitting, I recap my web browsing history. It provides insight into my thought processes, aids my memory and encourages some continuity of purpose. But I'm unaware of any detailed history log generated by browsing pages in in-app browsers. Currently I work around this by opening in-app browser pages in Safari so that they are logged, but in practice I often forget to do so.\nMy SOHO router doesn't allow HTTP logging.\nIs there a way to obtain in-app browser history? And would router logging be a reliable method if available?\n\nA: There is currently (as of iOS 14) no way to view browser history if it's done within an app.  Developers use Apple's SFSafariViewController class and it doesn't expose this option to developers.\nIn addition to not being able to view history, in-app browsers can't provide access to autofill data or website data.\n", "Q: This short AppleScript using weekday is not working as expected set currentDay to weekday of (get current date)\n\nif currentDay = \"Monday\" or currentDay = \"Tuesday\" or currentDay = \"Wednesday\" then\n    set earlymorningDisc to 1\nelse if currentDay = \"Thursday\" or currentDay = \"Friday\" then\n    set earlymorningDisc to 2\nelse\n    set earlymorningDisc to 3\nend if\n\nIt is always setting early morning disc to 3.

After updating to Big Sur, one of my three Mac Minis doen't recognize my HP6980 LAN-printer (neither on WiFi nor ethernet). It thinks it is a PCL-laser printer. Duplex recognized but it only prints black/white (status color cartridges not shown). The other 2 Mac Minis have no issues.\nHow do I try to fix this?\nEdit 20 dec 2020: The Mac giving the issue has a driver version 2.3\nThe Macs without issues have driver version 4.0.5. Even after \"forcing\" BS to choose the correct deskjet instead of the PCL-laser the wrong driver persists.\n\nA: We have had luck connecting a HP printer to the mac with USB, adding it to a local print queue and then letting software update install the drivers. The drivers are mostly monolithic so any update to any HP generally gets them all updated in one shot.\nIn the past, they had used a certificate to sign their helper app and when it was revoked, many chose to go get the driver and install it but I haven’t needed that procedure since a month after that event.\n", "Q: newsd eating my limited bandwidth Big Sur 11.1 and iMac Pro.

Does anyone else see 1Mbs constant downloading from newsd?  I base that info on an iStat Menus readout--and the fact that killing newsd in Activity Monitor instantly brings faster internet to all other apps.\n\nA: Yes, I too see an incredible amount of data usage from newsd. In my case, around 28GB was downloaded in 24 hours.\nI’ve opened a ticket with Apple Support.\n", "Q: In Shortcuts, how to find a specific photo? In Shortcuts, I added a PHOTOS / Find Photos action and I want it to select a certain specific photo. I see there is a filer \"Name is something\", but it does not seem to work.\nI tried to enter the filename (IMG_123.PNG), but it does not find the correct photo.\nIs the \"Name\" filter referring to some other name of the photo?

So when you look inside /var/vm on 10.15.7, you will still see any swapfiles that may be getting created during normal use of your machine.\nThe real reason that you're no longer seeing these files is because of a very good thing: Your system is managing to handle your workload using just physical (and possibly compressed) RAM and does not need to start swapping pages out to disk. This is due to a combination of things:\n\n*\n\n*Over time, xnu's virtual memory subsystem has been substantially improved and was made to be more aggressive both in finding contiguous free pages and in pooling and purging redundant and stale allocations from swap.\n\n*Memory compression was added as an intermediate management strategy between physical and swapped memory, so the kernel no longer starts paging out as soon as you hit your physmem reserve.\n\n*Both Apple and third-party developers make reducing resource usage a priority in their continual development efforts, so there are constantly updates being made to your OS and applications which are intended to lower their memory footprints.\n\nSo rest easy and enjoy knowing that your system is running more efficiently and more quickly due to a great deal of effort by many engineers all across the software stack over the course of many years.\nYou can confirm that there is no swap being using by using Activity Monitor's Memory tab. Pay attention to the Swap Used and Compressed fields at the bottom of the window.\n\nA: All is well - the system is managing this space better and better over time. As the system gets sliced into a user space overlay and a sealed and signed system overlay, it’s natural to have transient files like caches in a third filesystem.\nAll this is unlocked and enabled by APFS containers.\n", "Q: Magic Keyboard on Windows - How to get Media keys to work I'd like to purchase a magic apple keyboard for my windows pc. Do media keys like playing music, volume controls, and so on work on windows?\nIs there a way to map keys correctly on windows for all media/functions to work?\n\nA: I would assume the media keys on the Magic Keyboard would work with Windows 10, if the following were true.\n\n*\n\n*The Boot Camp Assistant was used to install Windows 10.\n\n\n*The model Mac is listed under Compatibility at the Apple Magic Keyboard website.\n\n\n*Under Windows settings, the Apple keyboard is chosen as the current input method.

It’s important to use the Finder, because it allows (via the same mechanism) to do more than change the name (like set a comment).\n\nA: It's quite odd that Finder would expose no method of converting a Path to a Finder file object, yet one doesn't appear to exist. Instead, it seems (per this question) that System Events' aliases property is the only way to convert a path string to a Finder object, like so:\nfile = Application('System Events').aliases['/some/file/path']\nconsole.log(file.name()) // --> 'path'\nfile.name = 'newname'\n\nFinder does allow you to manually drill down through the file hierarchy (see this answer), but it's a pain:\nfile = Application('Finder').startupDisk.folders['some'].folders['file'].documentFiles['path']\nconsole.log(file.name()) // --> 'path'\nfile.name = 'newname'\n\nHowever, only some of the attributes these objects are supposed to expose are actually working for me on Big Sur. (Reading and writing comments, for instance, does not seem to work.) If you need reliable and robust Finder scripting, JXA simply may not be the way to go.\n\nA: There is a global Path mentioned in the docs\nThis works for me:\nApplication(\"Finder\").delete(Path(\"/a/b/c\"));\n\n", "Q: Adobe Acrobat Ridiculous Document Protection – How to prevent an image from being copied from a PROTECTED document? I have added images to a PDF and I have protected that PDF with password, so the only think, in theory, that I have authorized is printing.\nEven so I open that PDF on Preview, click on any image, CMD C and CMD and I can copy that image easily.\nI know that anyone can take a screnshot of that document and copy the images, but here is the point. The images are irregular and have transparency and they are over a background with an irregular pattern, so, if someone takes a screenshot will have a hell of a job to separate the stolen image from the background, so it can be used on other contexts. But if the image can be selected on Preview, copied and pasted, stealing the images are a piece of cake.\nYes, I have closed and opened the document, after protecting it. I am aware of this bug.\nWhat kind of protection is this offered by Adobe Acrobat?\n\nA: You shouldn't rely on that feature for serious protection of your document. It is simply not possible to restrict access to the image by third party software if you still want the user to be able to view it. I.e. it is not really a bug in Preview, it is a limitation in what's actually possible for Adobe to enforce.\nYou could take a screenshot of the final, composed product and use that in the PDF instead of your original material. That way the image will be blended together with the rest and cannot as easily be separated again.\n\nA: The entire suite of options within Adobe's PDF apps is pretty much optional to any other PDF-capable app. There's no way to truly lock a file.\nStack overflow has a list of ways to bypass protection -\nHow to remove security from a PDF file?\nAnother is 'just find an app that doesn't respect that particular aspect of protection'. You found one, Preview, there are many more.\n\nA: I work in Information Security and always say that once someone can put their eyes on some information, it is gone. There is absolutely no way to prevent the data from leaking if there is such a will.\nYou can screenshot it, you can learn by heart, you can make a photo - whatever.\nThe only two protections you can expect is confidentiality against the ones that do not have the (wisely chosen) password of an encrypted file, or integrity of a correctly digitally signed document.\n\nA: It seems like you're more concerned about protecting the graphic design elements of your PDF, and not so much about protecting any classified information included the PDF, correct?\nIf that is the case, I recommend flattening all design elements first (without including text), then export to PDF. This will turn convert all graphic elements into a single image so that none of the design elements can be pulled apart.\nNext, import the flattened PDF into InDesign (or whatever program you're using), add all text elements over it and re-export.\nLet me know if this helps.\n\nA: To secure your image, you need stronger protection than PDF can offer. Why not use Apple technologies instead of Adobe for this?\nPut any insecure document format in a secure disk image.\n", "Q: Does Apple Watch identify \"me\" while using Apple Pay on Cellular without iPhone nearby? Is it safe to use Apple Pay on Watch like on iPhone? As far as I know, Apple Watch does not need a passcode or something to pay with Apple Pay nor unlock Apple Watch (but probably it can be set).\nNow let's talk about Apple Watch 6 Cellular version in situation when iPhone is not nearby (I left it in home).\nAs we know, when we want to pay with Apple Pay on iPhone, the phone requires TouchID or FaceID to identify that \"we\" are we.\nDoes a similar identification mechanism exist on the Apple Watch? Does Apple Watch know if really \"I\" am wearing the Watch or when my watch would be stolen, Apple Pay can be used by anybody else as long as then will use it when it is on someone's wrist?\n\nA: The Apple Watch requires the user to have set a passcode in order to use Apple Pay with the watch.\nWhen you put the watch on, it will request a passcode. You can use Apple Pay only after you have entered the passcode. The Watch by default continuously monitors that it is still on your wrist - if you take it off, it locks itself again and requests the passcode.\nYou can disable Wrist Detection, but that will disable Apple Pay on the 1st Gen Watch, and on newer watches you'll be prompted for your passcode when you attempt to use Apple Pay.\nYou can also use the \"Unlock with iPhone\" feature so that you unlock the Watch with your iPhone (i.e. by entering a passcode on the iPhone or using TouchID/FaceID).\n", "Q: Restore From Time Machine Backup With Incomplete Backup as the Last one I am using macOS Mojave 10.14.6.  I had performed a complete backup on 6th Dec.  My machine was then formatted and the OS re-installed.  Subsequently, a backup took place before I could restore my files.  It also stopped midway.

Will the Migration Assistant ignore 2020-12-09-073227.inProgress and restore from the latest backup?\n\n\nA: Yes, inProgress backups are ignored by Migration Assistant in my experience. Migration Assistant usually lets you choose which backup you would like to restore. In progress backups don't show in Time Machine when browsing the backup history until they are completed, so they also don't show in the list of backups to restore in Migration Assistant.\n", "Q: Possible reasons for very laggy video on external 4K monitor from MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)? I bought a 4K Dell P2721Q monitor and connected it to my old late 2013 MacBook Pro 15\" via a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. It connected without problems and shows that I have 4K resolution and 60Hz refresh rate.\nWhen I tried to play 4K video on YouTube in Chrome, it was constantly showing a \"loading\" indicator. I thought it was problem with my Internet, but playing the same video in 4K on the MacBook display works fine and smooth.\nThen I tried playing 4K YouTube video from Safari, it was definitely better than in Chrome, but it was still choppy. Doing some other activities like browsing/scrolling tall websites seems to work OK, there is are no lags.\nWhat could be potential problems to investigate? Is this possible due to bad cable (I bought one in the mid price range, it has clear 4K 60hz marking on it and there are user reviews which claim it worked fine for them)? I noticed that after several minutes of playback CPU temp rises above 80 degrees up to 90 and then returns back below 80 (fans start to work louder). Could it be due to some CPU throttling?\nAnything else I should try to check?\nMacbook details:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2 GB, Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\n\nA: It's about the decoding codec. Chrome does not support hardware accelerated vp9 codec on Mac OS, which is required to decode any 4k video on Youtube. Which means when decoding the 4k video it's using your CPU's resource instead of the GPU. Good luck trying to decode any 4k video using a mobile CPU, it simply won't work, a 9900k might do it, but a mobile chip, nope. For safari it should support hardware VP9 decoding, however, your Macbook is so old I highly suspect that the GPU does not support VP9 decoding.\nAnyway my Macbook Air 2020 has difficulty running 4k on Chrome, and always drops frame during the first few seconds of full screen on a 4k external monitor when using Safari. Time to buy a new laptop if you want smooth 4k video experience.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set iCloud to keep enough SSD space on Macbook Air? I am using a Macbook Air 2020 with a 250 GB SSD running Catalina and I keep running out of hard drive space, despite having about 60 GB available on iCloud.\nThere's about a 35 GB difference, which I attribute to apps and system files which only stay on the laptop. Already running \"Optimize my Mac\" and old files and photo clearly go through a retrieval process when I try to open them.\nIs there another setting that would keep 20-40 GB of headroom on the SSD drive vs. getting close to topping out?\nI use Clean My Mac X to eliminate 3-6 GB of junk at a time. Can see the discrepancies below in my iCloud and Finder Storage totals. Thanks.\n\n\nA: All you need to do is right click on a folder in icloud using finder, takes a second. Right click on the folder and select \"remove download\".\nThis is a simple control to manage  iCloud storage locally.\n\nA: I would probably focus on using webmail and archiving your 50 GB of emails. Apple already optimizes iCloud, but you’ve not given it enough room for the files you are storing.\nOnce Mail is free, start moving the 50 GB of local documents into iCloud so that the rules for what is stored locally and what exists in the cloud have a chance to balance your local storage.\nEverything should fit fine, but you just need to do a two step migration. Before you start, be sure you make one archival backup. Maybe time machine to a new drive that you disconnect for 3 months and be sure you reach balance.

We have checked the network cable on the other 2012 Mac - it is working.  The problem exists regardless of whether it is cabled or Wi-Fi.  On the machine in question:\n\n*\n\n*ifconfig returns an IP address and the correct gateway.\n\n*Other machines on the LAN can ping the problem machine.\n\n*All settings (other than appropriate MACs/IPs) are identical to the other 2012 Mac which is working ok.\n\n*The router/gateway IP can be pinged.\n\n*The external IP address provided by our ISP and as identified on the router/gateway can also be pinged.\n\n*Neither of the DNS addresses provided by our ISP can be pinged.\n\n*Neither of the Google DNS IPs can be pinged 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4\n\n*Time and date are correct.\n\n*nslookup www.apple.com 8.8.8.8 times out with the response no servers could be reached.

If a computer can open the web page of the local router or another computer on the internal network - fix your router (after powering it down completely and all network gear to get a fresh start) or find a new network to test is my advice.\n\n*\n\n*If you can ping a router but not past the router - that's a router problem.\n\n*If you can reach http on the router or locally but not past the router, that's a router problem.\n\n*Networking is fiddly and hard - try to use DHCP and flat settings and fix the network so client setup is automatic and easy.\n\nBut, since we love to test and fix - here's my playbook for working with cranky networks. (Or worse, machines all in odd states from people that were well intentioned, but ended up breaking the network settings or diverging from what is needed on a specific network).\n\n*\n\n*Make a new admin account and delete everything network related. All interfaces, all adapters, all settings. Put nothing in the keychain of the new account and delete all other accounts on the Mac.\n\n*Set everything to DHCP or connect to a cell phone WiFi hotspot.\n\n*Open Safari and browse to captive.apple.com\n\n*Focus on http and not ping - ICMP traffic is heavily filtered and dropped from some networks.\n\n*Don’t try to overcome the first error you get, but learn why it failed. You shouldn't need to override DNS or bypass the router - the problem is your router, not the OS.\n\nPretty much the only thing I would do is issue a reachable command from the command line.\nscutil -r www.apple.com\nscutil -r www.google.com\n\nIf the web doesn't work to basic properties, get a network that is appropriate for testing - you wouldn't have to carry all that water you tried to debug a new OS setup - something is very off on the network to need all that.\n", "Q: Same file reappears on Relocate Items after each macOS update The following file keeps reappearing after each macOS update:\n/Users/Shared/Relocated\\ Items/Configuration/private/etc/shells.system_default\nAges ago I modified the file /etc/shells to add the latest bash version from Homebrew and after macOS changed to this new read only file system for the OS I see this on every update. I also noticed that private/etc/shells seem to be hard linked to /etc/shells, changing one file has an impact on the other (and I don't see a symlink).\nThe file under Relocated Items is not the modified file but seems to be the default file from macOS without changes (my file /etc/shells still has my changed for the Homebrew bash).\nIs there anything I can do to avoid this happening after each update? I always delete the whole Relocated Items folder (not just the shortcut under the Desktop) but it keeps coming back.\n\nA: Feeling kinda stupid as I found the explanation on the PDF named What Are Relocated Items? under the Relocated Items folder. The relevant part for the clarification is:\nConfiguration files with the suffix \"system_default\" were edited or customized, but the changes were allowed to remain installed. The system_default version of the file is provided to demonstrate what the Apple supplied version of this file would look like. It is recommended that you compare the two and evaluate whether you wish to integrate any changes Apple may have made to the default version.\nAs I modified this file, looks like Apple will always provide the default version of this file so I can manually compare it with my modified version and merge any relevant changes. So no way to avoid this behavior but finally I understand why this happens after each update.\n", "Q: macbook pro: windows are too big on external Samsung 32\" monitor I purchased this Samsung 32\" external monitor which is 1920 x 1080p:\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-32-Curved-1920x1080-HDMI-60hz-4ms-FHD-LCD-Monitor-LC32F39MFUNXZA-Speakers-Included/374473324\nWhen I plugged it into my 2018 Macbook pro with touchbar, the windows appear much bigger in comparison to my other Dell 32\" external monitor which has a higher resolution (2560 x 1440).\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JVQ8M3Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nI want to have more desktop space on the Samsung monitor so I want the windows to be smaller.

Just type in the search box “text” — or any other format, such as “docx,” or name of application, such as “word” — and a drop-down list should appear. Choose your desired format and Finder will search the current directory for any file corresponding to that format.\nThen, with the files organized in the search window, you can select all and move them to another folder of your choosing.\nThis method, while a bit tedious, can also be used for files of different formats, provided that you use Finder to search for each format (such as .txt or .docx), select and move all the results, and then search again for the remaining file formats within the parent folder.\nI hope this helps.\nEDIT: I don’t know how this would affect files that have the same name, so it might be a good idea to test on a few files before proceeding.\n\nA: \nI'm trying to move the files of multiple (100+) subfolders to the parent folder, but I don't want to do it manually for each.

I still have this blue bar indicating the connection on the top and my laptop indicates the connection, yet no internet connection.\nI tried:\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting my device\n\n*Resetting my Network Settings\n\n*Updating my iOS 14.x to 14.3\n\n*Connecting to another USB port\n\n*Connecting my iPhone to another laptop\n\nNone of the above worked, all the same.\nHowever, using Wi-Fi Hotspot instead of direct USB connection works perfectly fine but it's not an option for me.\nI also tried connecting through my second iPhone's Personal Hotspot (iPhone 8, iOS 14.3), same effect, it works over Wi-Fi, doesn't work over direct USB connection.\nAny thoughts? I appreciate any help.\nUPDATE\nAs of Dec 25th 2020 this issue is now Linux-specific only.\nI was able to connect via USB on Windows laptop after some painful acts of update. Force-(re)updated iOS via latest version of iTunes.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. Is your Laptop a Mac or a PC?\nIf it's a Mac, you might want to check if the USB connection has not been made inactive/lower service order in Network Settings within System Preferences on the Mac.\nTo check, go to System Preferences>Network; on the left you will see a list of connections (e.g. Wifi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, iPhone USB, etc.). If you see a green dot on those connections, it means you are connected to them.\nIf iPhone USB is showing as not connected, check if \"Disable unless needed\" has been enabled, and disable it if it is. Furthermore, if you have multiple successful connections, it is possible the service order prioritises the other connections over your USB connection. So at the bottom of that list, click on more options icon and select Set service order, now you should be able to reorder the connections priority to prioritise iPhone USB above wifi, ethernet, etc.\n\nFinally, you mentioned you have reset network settings. Did you do this on your iPhone or on your laptop?\nSometimes the trust relationship between the Laptop and iPhone can be corrupted or need a reset after updating. You can reset this trust relationship in iOS settings, by going to Settings>General>Reset>Reset Location & Privacy. After resetting location and privacy settings, the iPhone will prompt you to trust the device it is connecting to. Trusting the device (laptop) will rewrite the trust relationship between the two devices.\nNote, resetting location and privacy settings will prompt you to trust every other device your iPhone connects to. This should only happen on the initial connection to that device after you have reset these settings.\nLet me know how you go.

Which is run a script on a specific time or frequency.  Does one of them actually wake up the sleeping mac and execute?\nwhy would you use one over the other?\n\n*\n\n*launchagent\n\n*cronjob\n\n*calendar alarm\n\nthanks\n\nA: Prefer launchd\nFor non-graphical scripts, launchd is Apple's preferred approach.\ncron is available but no longer recommended by Apple. This is for energy efficiency reasons as cron checks every minute for due tasks.\nIn comparison to cron, launchd's time based trigger is limited but this allows launchd to reliably calculate an absolute date and time of future events. Knowing these dates, launchd can remain idle until they arrive.\nCalendar.app's alarm is useful for graphical scripts, such as AppleScript and Automator. For this to work, your Mac must be logged in and awake.\nGraphical versus non-graphical scripts\nGraphical scripts are those that interact with running Mac applications. These applications are assumed to have windows and a user interface. This means they require a graphical user session to work – and thus a user must be logged in for the application to be launched and kept running.\nGraphical scripts include AppleScript and Automator.\nNon-graphical scripts are those that limit their actions to command line tools and processes. They do not require a user to be logged in. The computer only needs to be awake for the script to complete its task.\nNon-graphical scripts include shell scripts and command line tools.\nWaking or powering on for a script\nNone of the built-in tools will power on or wake your Mac to perform your script. You will need a third party tool, such as Power Manager for this. I am affiliated with Power Manager, so feel free to get in touch with any questions.\n", "Q: Upgrading Python 2.7 to 3.8 : Recommended? I am running macOS Big Sur 11.1 on MacBook Air M1. It comes bundled with Python 3.9.1 for regular usage and running python command through terminal says that I have Python 2.7.16 for compatibility with legacy software.\nI want to install TensorFlow which specifically requires Python 3.8. So, if I upgrade Python 2.7.16 to Python 3.8 will it cause trouble with legacy software? If no, then is it a good idea to do this upgrade? If yes, can you please tell me the procedure? I don't find a pip installed on my machine but there is a pip3 to work with Python3.\nAlso, is there a way to find the list of software/packages installed on my machine that require Python 2.7.x to work?\n\nA: A bit of background\nPython2 and 3 are in many ways separate languages. For configuration and use definitely consider them as separate. The code you read and write is very similar though.\nPython 2 is not supported (by python.org) from  1/1/20. That is no bug fixes etc. So you should not be using it.\nDue to the difference you need separate pip versions. The standard macOS way is pip and python are links to the Python 2 versions. python3 and pip3 are the links to the Python 3 versions.\nAs usual with software supplied with macOS you do not upgrade Apple versions of software. However you can install other versions as well as the Apple versions. In fact the normal advice from python users is not to use Apple's versions but use another one.\nInstallation\nThe alternatives are install via a general package manager e.g. MacPorts, HomeBrew, Fink or from python bases managers python.org or I use Conda especially if you use numpy etc. (it does have a version of tensorflow).  python now comes with pyvenv and other tools to allow you to chose which version to use for a particular project, conda has a similar way of doing this, macports has a simple link allowing choice of one version or another globally and not by project.\nExisting scripts\nThere is no absolute way of seeing what uses python 2. However a reasonable guess is to look at the first line of each python file for the hash bang invocation. This tends to be #!/usr/bin/python or #!/usr/bin/env python for scripts that use python 2 - scripts using python3 will have 3 in the line.\nApps\nAgain no consistent  way.\nHowever the Apple recommendation is for apps that use an interpreter or runtime is to embed the interpreter into the app bundle - thus it is up to the application supplier to deal with python versions etc and the user does not need to and probably should not alter how the app is run.\n\nA: You can install Python 3.8 using homebrew. The instructions to install homebrew are on homebrew's home page. Currently the instructions are entering into a terminal window: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nThe instructions to install Python 3.8 are on the homebrew page for Python 3.8. Once you've installed homebrew, enter into a terminal window brew install python@3.8\nThis won't replace your stock Python installations, it will be installed into a separate location to avoid causing problems with stock legacy software. User legacy software may require you to explicitly specify the full path for the version of python it requires.\nI'm not aware of a method to find all software that uses the stock versions of Python.\n", "Q: How to tell if my iPad is connected to WiFi using WPA3, WPA2, or no security at all? In Settings > Wi-Fi, I tapped the i-in-circle info icon to get details on a network connection.

Is this normal with safari ?\n\nA: The rainbow cursor indicates that the application in question is blocked because the system watches for it saying it’s ready for things like keyboard input.\nThe page you are visiting is causing an entire app to block so that’s a problem for sure if you need that page to work before it gets fixed. It’s normal and expected the system lets you know one app is blocked, so you can go do other tasks in other apps and eventually force Safari to quit when you tire of waiting for it.\n", "Q: What is the transparencyd daemon for? transparencyd seems to be there since macOS Catalina.\nI cannot find any information about it other than what the MAN pages say :\n\"transparencyd is a system daemon that verifies transparency information \nfor requesting clients.

See How do I make a bootable USB OS X installer on a Mac? for a guide.\nLast point, reflecting bmike's answer. Even if you achieve all this it's going to be dog-slow. Doing this for free/cheap requires patience.\n\nA: One question per question is best here.\n\n*\n\n*yes\n\n*yes to a point / not really\n\n*not a concern for this old mac\n\nI recommend you buy a Mac mini that will run Catalina for $300 or less or a new mini that runs Big Sur. You will never get your time back using old gear.

Although it is not officially supported, the Early 2009 iMac can run macOS Sierra using Colin Mistr's Sierra Patch Tool.\n\nhttps://lowendmac.com/2009/imac-early-2009/\nXcode\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/download/more/ to download a version of Xcode you want. Specifically, get 9.2. This is the recent version that works with mac OS Sierra.\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/51405911/1549818\n\nXcode 9.2 includes Swift 4 and SDKs for iOS 11.2\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/whats-new/\nSo you will be limited to compiling up to iOS 11.2 with Xcode 9.2, providing you use the unofficial patch to install Sierra.\nActivation lock\n\nUpgrade your Mac to macOS Catalina.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT208987\nThis Mac can’t run Catalina as discussed above so there cannot be any activation lock active.\n", "Q: Connecting two MacBooks over USB-C for transferring video signal from one to the other I have two MacBooks (a Pro and an Air).  Both are modern and have USB-C.\nI would like to run the video output from one MacBook into the other, using USB-C, and then use the second Mac to stream the video using OBS.  Is this possible without putting some converter in the middle?  It feels like it should be...\n\nA: No, target display mode doesn’t work over USB-C.\nYou’ll want to screen share over point to point network for this.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.airsquirrels.com/airparrot/\nThe latency for screen sharing is very good now. You might have better luck with an iPad for this and sidecar or dedicated hardware to get it into OBS.\n\n*\n\n*https://shop.astropad.com/collections/luna-display-mac-and-pc\n\nA: Have you tried just connecting the two computers together by a USB-C or Thunderbolt cable to see if they network?  I know Thunderbolt supports this, a USB-C port lacking Thunderbolt might not.  Even so just as long as there is a network between the computers there is software to share the screen from one to the other.  The faster the network the better.  Built-in to the macOS is AirPlay and VNC for sharing the screen so there should be no need to buy any hardware or software.  The network can be WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or whatever.\nThere are USB \"transfer cables' that are petty much just two Ethernet adapters in a single cable.  These are often faster (5 Gnps) and cheaper (under $40) than two Ethernet adapters so consider looking for that if other options are too slow or simply not available.  I mention the term \"transfer cable\" since that is a common name for them. Another common name is the genericized trademark \"LapLink cable\", and there is a company called LapLink that has been making cables like these for decades.\nThere's general purpose video capture devices you can try, if all else fails.  These are USB 3.x devices that take an HDMI input.  These will cost something like $200.  Just using WiFi and screen sharing that's built-in is free, but there can be issues of quality that drive people to spend over $200 on getting the best video.\nYou are correct that this is possible without some converter in the middle.  Getting the best results might require some hardware though.\n", "Q: How do I force my Mac to log in to an account remotely? It’s possible to restart a Mac from the command line (sudo shutdown -r now). It’s possible to log out from a Mac from the command line (sudo pkill loginwindow). But is it possible to force a Mac to log in from the command line? As in a full log in of an account, GUI-wise, not just logging in via SSH to the Mac via the Terminal.\n\nA: Yes.\n\n*\n\n*Enable FileVault so you can escrow user and password securely\n\n*sudo fdesetup authrestart sets the machine to restart and log in as the specified user after the restart.\n\nThis works for me remotely on new Macs with Big Sur. You may need ssh Or Apple Remote Desktop to log in remotely, but the above command works when I can’t be there to get past the FileVault log in screen and I’m remote and it generates a graphical log in from a remote ssh session.\nOnce the restart completes, Mail can start. Set it to launch at log in if you wish and you’re set. You don’t need auto log in since this works to make auto log in one time only.\n\nA: I created something like this for Remote Desktop to signing a xServe. We had more than 1 account, and we had to sign un with both username and password. I ran this remotely through the terminal to prior to pulling up the screen.\n`osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\"' -e 'keystroke \"USERNAME\"' -e 'keystroke tab' -e 'delay 0.5' -e 'keystroke \"PASSWORD\"' -e 'delay 3.5' -e 'keystroke return' -e 'keystroke return' -e 'end tell'`\n\nJust replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD and that should work.  I have not tested this on a more recent OS, but I hope this helps.\n", "Q: Restore Download icon in Finder Sidebar I'm on macOS Big Sur 11.1, and I wanted to use a different folder for my Safari downloads, so I created another directory and did ln -s ~/Downloads on it (symlinked).\nEverything works fine except for a small thing.\nIn the Finder app, on the sidebar, this folder has a \"standard folder\" icon, even if it is recognized in the preferences as my Downloads folder (see the attached pictures).\nIs there any way to at least make the Finder think that folder as the original Downloads folder?\nOr maybe is there a way to manually change its icon?\nPlease note that I already found some answers to my question on this site, but they seem to not to be compatible with Big Sur.\n\n\n\nA: Have you tried to uncheck the Downloads folder in the Finder Preferences and just drag the symlinked folder to the sidebar?\n\nA: From what I've understood, this is what I could come up with. As useless as this may sound, have you tried unchecking and re-checking the box that enables Downloads in the sidebar? Also, you can try going to the parent directory of the Downloads folder, right-clicking the Downloads folder, and then clicking \"Get Info\" to see if the Download icon is there for the Downloads folder. If there isn't then you need to get the icon from somewhere and then drag it onto the existing icon in the \"Get Info\" window. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I had this same issue. Everything was checked in Finder Preferences and it drove me nuts. Turned out that in the top left of the sidebar where it says 'Favorites' there is an arrow to the right '>'   Once I clicked that, it dropped the folders down into view. \n", "Q: MacBook connects to the JBL Flip 4 and then disconnects In the past, I was able to connect my MacBook to the JBL (but maybe it was another JBL, I am not sure), but now I am not able to, because it disconnects 5 seconds (or so) after the Bluetooth connection has been established.\nI already tried the procedure suggested in this answer, but nothing changed. Of course, I also tried to turn on and then off the Bluetooth, remove the device and search for it again, but nothing really worked (i.e. it finds the device again and connects, but then automatically disconnects it). So, any ideas? I am on a Mac OS Catalina (10.15.7).\nBtw, I am able to connect my Samsung Galaxy to the JBL. Also, previously, I was able to use the JBL speakers with a cable, but that cable broke (apparently), so I can't use it anymore, so I guess the problem is related to the Bluetooth.\n\nA: It worked for me on my boombox 2 to reset the speaker by pressing and holding + and play at the same time for 3 seconds.\n", "Q: Kali Linux on SD card not showing in boot loader I installed Kali Linux on my SD Card. The way I did it was:\n\n*\n\n*Make a bootable USB with the Kali Linux image burned on it\n\n*Then use that USB to boot up the Kali Linux installer\n\n*By the Kali Linux installer I selected the SD Card.\n\nHowever, once I go to the boot manager and plug in my SD Card, it's not showing Kali Linux.\n\nA: The most common way to fix this issue is to go to the Mac Terminal and type in the following:\nFirst, type diskutil list. Find the Kali Linux bootable SD and find the identifier of the EFI partition. This will look something like disk2s1. Once you have that, type sudo diskutil mount disk2s1. Once it is mounted, go to Finder and press Command + Shift + G and type in /Volumes/EFI. Once you are in there, double click on the EFI folder, double click on the Boot folder, and rename grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi. Then, in Terminal, type diskutil unmount EFI. Then restart into the Boot Manager and see if you can find your Kali SD. It should appear as \"EFI Boot\".\nYou can also replace the icon of the Kali SD. First, make sure the image you want is in the .icns file format. Then go to the Mac Terminal and type sudo diskutil mount diskidentifier. Replace diskidentifier with the disk identifier from before. Then, type cd /Volumes/EFI and rm .VolumeIcon.icns. Then, type cp /path/to/image.icns /Volumes/EFI/.VolumeIcon.icns. Then, type diskutil unmount EFI.\nThe Kali Linux installer may not name the EFI partition EFI by default. If that is the case, you will need to use NO\\ NAME instead. In the case that neither of those names work, use the disk identifier that you got previously.\n\nHere is an image of what you might see in the EFI partition if it was called NO NAME. You can ignore all the contents of that partition except those in the EFI folder.\nNow, your Kali Linux SD will work on any Intel Based, and maybe even an Apple Silicon based Mac.\nMake sure you follow each step carefully or else you may end up ruining the SD and needing to erase it.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: MBP (2016) to Thunderbolt Display with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter and extension cable I have a MBP15 (2016) and connected it to my Thunderbolt Display via the official [Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter]. but the cable is too short for my needs right now. I tried 3 different Extension Cables (1, 2, 3) but none of them worked (no image on the screen). Is there a cable that works? If not possible is there a dock that can do this?\n\nA: Sure. Any thunderbolt 3 or 2 dock will work. Be sure to read the friendly manual - not all cables that fit physically in a thunderbolt slot are thunderbolt cables and cables can be faulty.\nI’ve only seen 10 foot 2 cables in copper. You’ll need optical to go further and they are pricey but very long range.

There is no archive process since that is different than backup.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\nShort of you using time machine to look at that folder in the past, you would need to locate another copy of the file using spotlight in case you moved it to a different location.\nSince you don’t mention your version, here is an article describing some clean up options.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206996\nThe system doesn’t purge any files unless you set that up, and then only in trash.\n", "Q: Is it possible to take multiple tabs out of Safari into a new window? On macOS Safari, you can create a new Safari window by dragging a tab out of the tab bar.\nOn Chrome across platforms, you can command (or control) click on tabs to select multiple tabs, and then when you drag out a tab it will create a new window with tabs.\nI like this feature of Chrome and always try to do it in Safari. However, command clicking tabs does not select multiple tabs. Is there any way to take multiple tabs from a Safari window and convert them into a new window?\n\nA: It is possible to somewhat replicate the functionality with workaround but this can be considered as a clumsy and non-intuitive way.\nIt takes advantage on pinning pages. In general terms:\n\n*\n\n*pin needed tabs\n\n*open new Safari window\n\n*unpin tabs\n\nIn order to make it simpler to use from keyboard one can define shortcut to toggle pinning i.e. two operations with same shortcut: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App shortcuts, app Safari, one for 'Pin Tab' and another for 'Unpin Tab', assign same keyboard shortcut (for example ⌥⌘P).\nPossible workflow from keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*navigate between Safari tabs using ⌃⇥ (Control-Tab)\n\n*pin needed tabs with keyboard shortcut (for example ⌥⌘P),\n\n*when all needed tabs are pinned open new Safari window with ⌘N,\n\n*go through all pinned tabs using ⌃⇥ and unpin them using shortcut.\n\n\nA: No, you cannot do that in one go with Safari like you can in Chrome. You have to first drag out one tab to make a new window, and then manually drag each following tab to that new window.\n", "Q: How can I control Music with arbitrary global hotkeys (SizzlingKeys replacement) on Catalina? On High Sierra I was able to control the playback of iTunes using arbitrary keys of an external keyboard (one without any Media control keys) using SizzlingKeys.\nBut SizzlingKeys is a 32-bit app and no longer works on Catalina.\nWhat is the best SizzlingKeys replacement, allowing me to assign arbitrary global keys as hotkeys, allowing me to start/stop playback regardless whether the Music app is in the foreground or not?\n\nA: Global hotkeys controlling Music even when in the background can be achieved by using a combination of MacMediaForwarder and Karabiner-Elements:\n\n*\n\n*Install MacMediaKeyForwarder: https://github.com/milgra/macmediakeyforwarder/releases\n\n*Install Karabiner-Elements: https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org\n\n*Configure Karabiner-Elements using \"Simple modifications\" so that your desired global hotkey maps onto key_code::play_or_pause (or any other action).\n\nThis can also be used to map the global volume control to arbitrary global hotkeys which I find very useful when using an external keyboard.

Is there a way?\n\nA: I'll answer myself, though it's a partial answer.\nWhen tmutils is used with partitions like /, the result isn't a true snapshot, the file system I mount this way reflects the original one in real-time (ie, any change in the original is immediately visible in the \"snapshot\").\nIn order to make it work, I have to mount partitions like this:\nvol_path=/System/Volumes/Data\nsnap_id=$(tmutil snapshot \"$vol_path\" | sed s/'Created local snapshot with date: '//)\nmount_apfs -o rdonly -s \"com.apple.TimeMachine.${snap_id}.local\" \"$vol_path\" snap-mnt\n\nThis works fine when you want to backup a subdirectory like /System/Volumes/Data/Users/user/.\nThe flip side is that directories like /etc aren't under Data/, but /etc/ is actually a link to Data/private/, so one doesn't lose much by backing up the Data/ dir only.\n", "Q: Retrieving music from an old account I bought music from iTunes with my credit card, but it was my son’s iTunes account.  We shared a pc at that time. Can I retrieve my music and put it into my iTunes account?\n\nA: You cannot transfer the purchase.\nHowever, you could use a computer with the other account and download all the music. You can transfer the files to wherever you'd like - but if you lose them again you'd still need the original files.\nIf you use a service like iTunes Match or Apple Music, adding these files to your iTunes Library after signing into your account should cause the music to be uploaded.\n\nA: No. Purchases are final. What you could do is see if family sharing allows you to share purchases across accounts.\n", "Q: Can the transparencyd daemon traffic be dropped without adverse effects? Based on what the transparencyd daemon is for (explained here) I have the impression so far there is no harm in blocking that traffic. Until now, every time my firewall drew my attention onto that outbound trancparencyd traffic, I blocked it and experienced no adverse effects.\nAm I missing something, or is there indeed no harm in blocking transparencyd traffic?\n(I am on Catalina. Perhaps things got worse in Big Sur.)\n\nA: Since the questions was asked I have systematically blocked all the transparencyd traffic, and have not experienced any adverse side effects.\n", "Q: Does high-availability VM for Mac OS X exist? I seek rock-stable, production-worthy virtual machines capability with macOS.\nI'm relatively a noob when it comes to VMs. High availability clusters are all the rage, and I can see why. I took over as the sysadmin for an SMB and we have 7 Mac Mini's in the machine room; each one running one thing, each obviously underutilized, and each without redundancy.\nIf I ran Win services, a good strategy would be to deploy up to 7 instances on a pair of servers in a high availability configuration, active/passive failover, etc., correct? And until Apple changes their mind, that's an impossibility in OS X Land?\n\nA: Yes, high-availability for macOS definitely exists.\nAs on Windows, you cannot just push some magical button and have any computer with whatever generic software suddenly run in a HA system, being it active/passive or active/active.\nThe way to setup a HA system depends on the services you want the system to offer. Is it a highly available network storage system you require? - is it a highly available build server? is it a highly available rendering system?\nIn some cases it is not optimal to use virtual machines at all, but rather use software running bare-metal to implement the highly available services.\nIn other cases, you can use VMs to have an easier way to implement for example an active/passive fail-over style high availability. This usually comes with some draw backs, but they are the same here as in an Windows environment.\nOne of the simplest setups here is to have the virtual machine disk itself be stored on a storage system shared by a pair of Mac Minis (or more). The storage system itself needs to be highly available as well. You would then replicate the configuration of the virtual machine between the two Mac Minis, implement a heart beat system and have the passive computer automatically take over when the heart beat stops. Typically this is a type of STONITH, which can be implemented in multiple ways.\nA well known industry implementation of such a simple system is the VMware vSphere HA system, where you basically run ESXi on the Mac Minis and use vSphere with vSphere HA to do monitoring and automatic failover. The shared storage system can be implemented in many different ways (although most have drawbacks).\n\nA: We run esxi Bare Metal Hypervisor on Intel Macs, ARM, Dell and other consumer and server grade hardware. All are exceptionally stable, documented and supported.\nIf you are not into owning the hardware or wish to co-locate it, MacStadium  is the long time vendor of choice for virtualization.\nThese are all a decade old (except Kubernetes and ARM esxi), so you should check it out... also, don’t waste any time on HA software or features initially. Sprinkle that on last of and only if you really, really need it.\n\nA: Amazon Web Services launched Mac EC2 instances three weeks ago. It’s not something you can host yourself, but it certainly gives you access to rock-stable production-ready Mac virtual machines.\n", "Q: Why is my computer crashing? panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7fa1bf9231): nvme: \"Fatal error occurred.

What remedies do I have? Thanks\n\nA: This message means that the operating system has stopped the computer from running because of an error within the NVM Express (NVMe) system. NVMe here refers to the SSD in your computer. It seems you do not have an original Apple SSD, but rather some third party SSD from OWC.\nThe cause of the error could either be a hardware error with the SSD, a software bug in the NVMe driver, or some compatibility issue between the two.\nIf this is the only time you have received the message, I would dismiss it as a random bug. If this is something that happens regularly for you, I would try booting from Recovery mode or from a separate, known good, macOS installations. If panics also occur there, it indicates a hardware issue - if it doesn't occur there (even when reading/writing to the drive), it could very well be a software issue - and a macOS reinstallation would probably be wise.\n", "Q: Is it possible to automate changing some security settings in Catalina?

But it disappears too quickly.\nHow can I tweak time of that snippets?\n\n\nA: This is not the answer to the question but an alternative to achieve desired result as I see it.\nOne can copy screenshot to clipboard and then paste it into application/file needed. For that to work just press ⌃ (Control) while taking screenshot. Then ⌘+V in desired file/application to paste screenshot from clipboard. In case of Preview it's sufficient to open new Preview window (⌘+N) and screenshot from clipboard is displayed automagically.\n\nA: I had a look at the plist for Screen Capture and there doesn't seem to be a time period to extend the time the thumbnail stays on screen. But you can disable/enable the thumbnail and/or change the default location the screenshot is saved to. For me, I have all my screenshots saved to Desktop so it's easily accessible for editing and have thumbnails disabled.\nTo change these two settings open the app Screenshot by searching in Spotlight. You will then get a cropped window and bar with options at the bottom of the cropped window. Click on Options and you'll see \"Show floating thumbnail\" and \"Save to\" options. You can enable/disable floating thumbnail and/or save all screenshots to another file location by default.\nSee image below for an example:\n\nBy the way, behind the cropped area (on the left), you will see the plist file for screen capture that I was looking at. As you can see there isn't a value to change the thumbnail length.\nHope this may help somewhat for you :)\n", "Q: Transfering file and folder permissions to a clean install with rsync? I'm periodically backing up my Mac user-folder to a remote machine by running rsync with a cron job on my machine. I'm thinking that anything useful will be in the user-folder and I can always reinstall the missing software with homebrew, so no use backing up anything else.\nMy backup command looks something like this:\nrsync -av --delete /Users/oxprox_1/ -e \"$SSH_OPTS\" remote_machine:/backups/oxprox_1/\n\nNow I recently had to replace my hard drive and do a clean install of a new OS. It was the first time I had to rsync my whole user-folder back. During the OS install I changed my username so the user folder on my machine is now named differently and I guess this UID number is also different even if the name had been the same (or is it?). If I remember correctly, I ran something like this on my machine to pull my files back:\nsudo rsync -av remote_machine:/backups/oxprox_1/ -e \"$SSH_OPTS\" /Users/oxprox_2/\n\nI think I used sudo because it wouldn't modify files without it. If I remember correctly I had some issues with the permissions of my files and I managed to figure it out somehow, maybe by manually changing all the permissions, but I have been having some weird problems and issues after that.\nNow I'm planning to do a new clean install and pull my old backups again, as I have not been updating the files on the remote machine after the hard drive change. So how should I do this to get the permissions correctly when returning files on my clean install, even though the username is different? I guess it should transfer all the permissions to the new user on the destination side. I want to transfer all the preferences and setting for the applications and not just my documents etc.\nI have been reading about the rsync archieve option and I think maybe it could work if I just use -rlptDv instead and omit the -o option, but I'm not sure. Also what about the group permissions, I'm the only user on my computer.\nCould you help me to understand how to do this properly? I have been reading answers here but I still don't understand this fully. I'm also open to suggestions if there are some better options to do the backups. I would still rather use rsync than Time Machine because it's so neat and easy to automate. Thanks!\n\nA: As you have discovered Time Machine and the system migration scripts handle all the little corners where files are customized per unique account or tied into a system file or just not to be backed up. I would probably rsync back the files into a new short name for which no user exists on the system.\nThen take advantage of the system to fix permissions by creating the new user and answering yes when it sees the home folder present matching the short name of the user you are about to create.\n\n*\n\n*Delete oxprox_2 account or copy into oxprox_3\n\n*Create the account to match the restore path\n\n*Let the system fix permissions on the restored files\n\n*Log in to the new account and test\n\nBasically, delay making the account until after you’ve done the restore.\n", "Q: macOS: find last time AirPods Bluetooth headphones were connected/in the range I have either lost my AirPods either someone stole them, and I would like to find more details to find which possibilities is most likely.\nUnfortunately my AirPods are not listed under Find My (probably I forgot to activate that function).

If so, macOS will assume internet is available but slow, and will continue to make you wait while it Apple's servers whether the app's certificate has been revoked (for security reasons).\nWhen you disable WiFi in macOS it's immediately clear that there's no internet access and suddenly your convenience starts to matter, i.e. quick launches.\nYou could configure the WiFi network to not have a gateway set, which would probably solve the problem. The DHCP server configuration simply needs to be changed to not set a default gateway.\nIf you're not able to change the configuration of the DHCP server, you can make a note of the IP address and subnet mask given by the DHCP server (as seen in System Preferences > Network), and then disable DHCP on the Mac and send it to manual instead - entering the same IP address and subnet mask. Preferably you should then remove this particular address from the DHCP pool on the DHCP server so that it is not given to a different computer later.\n", "Q: How to add padding to a word in Pages?

Is this The Exhaustive List of which apps do have access? Is there any way (short of an iOS bug) an app could access the mic/camera without it being listed here in the Microphone/Camera settings?\n\nA: The first attempt by any app to access the microphone or camera will cause an OS-level confirmation dialog to grant permission. This adds the app to that list with the ability to grant/revoke the permission.\nThere are no exceptions to this; these are the only APIs that Apple makes available.\nAlso note that there is a ‘speech recognition’ category in Privacy which you may consider access to the microphone, albeit just what words are spoken as text if any. iOS does the speech recognition on behalf of the app; if the app does the recognition, that’s the generic Microphone category of access.\n\nA: No.  It’s a bug or jailbreak for an iOS app to access the hardware directly.\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"App Store\" and \"App Store Connect\" I keep reading documentation on the process of creating an app for the 'app store' where it references app store connect and app store seemingly interchangeably.

If you cant format it in disk utility, try going to internet recovery and selecting the terminal. once in the terminal type\ndiskutil list\nThen find the your newly installed disk drive labeled in the format of /dev/diskXwhere \"X\" is whatever disk number your new ssd is.

It happens with a variety of videoconferencing applications as skype, webex, zoom, GotoMeeting but strangely not with FaceTime. I thought it was an adaptor problem but I have changed four adaptors: Satechi Multiport (tried 3 different ones) and Belkin USB-C multimedia hub.\nAfter updating to Big Sur the problem got even worse as it not only freezes my ethernet, but forces my home VDSL modem to disconnect from the Internet and I need to reboot it to get connected again.\nI also posted it at the Apple community forum and it appears others have this problem as well.

In the past, I had used dosdude1's High Sierra patcher to get macOS 10.13 on an older Mac Pro. However, the GPU in this machine is a non-flashed AMD R9 270X, so I couldn't get a boot screen and had to rely on setting the boot drive either before rebooting or setting it from command line.\nRecently I tried to see if I could experiment with Mojave and the newer patcher, but I don't seem to get the video card to wake up like it did with the High Sierra patcher. Of course, being a non-flashed card I can't see the boot screen so I can't tell if the USB gets recognized or not, but after letting it sit for several minutes I don't get anything and I wonder if it is going to even work with this graphics card. With the High Sierra patcher, it would eventually come to life so I could install the AMD 5xxx/6xxx patch (though my card is a 7xxx).\nAnyone know? I think Mojave or Catalina might be pushing it for the old beast at this point, but any last drops of life I can squeeze out of it before I drop money on an M1 :-)\n\nA: 'older Mac Pro'… specifics would be good.\nHowever, the R9 270X in its HD 7950 guise works fine on a 4,1 with firmware upgrade & a standard 5,1. With an unflashed card you must not use anything which needs the bootscreen - filevault or EFI/firmware lock of any sort.\nThe smart money was always on keeping the original video card for situations such as these, though neither the GT120 nor the HD5700 can actually run Mojave.\nAnecdotally, Mojave is better than High Sierra imho, but personally I wouldn't push any cheesegrater to Catalina.\nYou'd be wise in any case to very carefully read dosdude's page on Mojave, as it contains a lot of caveats dependent on the precise Mac Pro model.\n", "Q: Can I revert a new MacOS X installation using a Time Machine backup? I regularly use Time Machine to create backups of my current macbook.\nI am trying to upgrade to MacOS X Big Sur, but I was wondering what happens if I don't like it?\nIs it possible to downgrade back to my current version of MacOS X using a Time Machine backup from just before upgrading the system?\nI do not use any specialty boot up situation. I do not boot up from external drives.\nIt's just my laptop with its SSD. I keep larger files in external drives but OS X doesn't get installed to those drives.\n\nA: The simple answer is yes.\nIf you have a complete Time Machine Backup of your system, wiping the disk and restoring the computer will install the macOS version of your TM Backup. You can read more about the full procedure on Macworld or on this blog or here.\nThe general procedure of downgrading macOS with a TM backup is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Make a TM Backup\n\n*Shut down your machine and boot into recovery mode (press cmd + r right after boot chime)\n\n*Connect your external TM Backup drive and select Restore From Time Machine Backup\n\n*Continue and select your latest Backup to restore your machine\n\nEdit: As Tetsujin mentioned in the comments, it is very important to unplug your TM drive before upgrading to the new OS and not reconnect afterwards. Ideally you get a second drive to start new Backups for the macOS version and not let the new Mac version touch the old Backup hard drive!\n\nIt is actually even possible to downgrade your macOS version without a TM Backup. You can read more about where to get the installers and more over here: How can I download an older version of macOS/OS X?\n", "Q: \"AKauthorization remote view\" ? Did someone hack my macbook? So my macbook air was making a lot of noise. I opened the activity monitor and saw \"akd\" and \"AKauthorization remote view\" consuming most of the CPU (50%)+. So I stopped it and completely erased my macbook thinking it got hacked. Does anyone know what \"AKauthorization remote view\"  is?\n\nA: It is unlikely you have been hacked. A process on your Mac is likely trying to verify your Apple ID with Apple's Sign On services.\n\n*\n\n*AK = AuthKit\n\n*AS = Authentication Services\n\nPrivate AuthKitUI Framework\nAKAuthorization appears to be part of Apple's private AuthKitUI framework. This framework is stored at /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AuthKitUI.framework on macOS.\nThe public Authentication Services likely uses AuthKitUI to provide the user interface:\n\nUse the Authentication Services framework to improve the experience of users when they enter credentials to establish their identity.\n\n*\n\n*Give users the ability to sign into your services with their Apple ID.\n\n*...\n\n\nIt is likely AKAuthorizationRemoteViewService is a user interface element that shows content provided by a remote service.\nSee jujigo\n/\nDragonBuild source that mentions this framework's contents.\nGiven AuthKit (AK) is a System Programming Interface (SPI) – and thus private to Apple's engineers – only Apple can authoritatively answer this question. You should provide feedback to Apple about this behaviour.\n", "Q: How to move through words and break on punctuation on terminal? I changed laptop and I cannot configure my Terminal the way it was.\nI had this shortcut to delete words, and when deleting ab-cd.ef_gh, it would go ab-cd.ef_ then ab-cd. then ab- then nothing. So it would break on hyphens and on other such characters. But the behaviour now is to delete the full sequence ab-cd.ef_gh instead of doing it \"one by one\". How can I do that?\n\nA: I found an answer on Super user\nThe issue was that Mac went from bash to zsh. There is nothing about a shortcut to \"delete part of a word\". The solution is to use the common \"delete word\" shortcut and define what a word is: bash defines a word to be a-zA-Z0-9 but not zsh which defines words as anything in between spaces (so ab.cd or /ef/gh/ij).\nfor the sake of completeness, add to your .zshrc:\nautoload -U select-word-style\nselect-word-style bash\n\n", "Q: Apple TV crashes internet upon startup for 5 minutes We just got the Apple TV 4K and are having a weird problem. When Apple TV is plugged in and setup and we turn on our TV (Samsung), our internet completely crashes. After about 4-5 minutes everything reconnects and once it reconnects, everything that was connected to wifi works perfectly (including the Apple TV).\nI thought it was the Apple TV but we bought another one and are having the same issue. What's weird is that we used to have a Roku stick and didn't have any issues - it's only with the Apple TV. Internet also only drops when we turn on the TV (which boots up Apple TV) but not during any other time.\nI have the Apple TV right next to my Verizon Fios router and again, haven't had any issues prior to using Apple TV. I've tried looking at my router settings and have upgraded firmware but can't figure it out.\nHas anyone else ever had this problem?\nThanks,\nJeff\n\nA: Perhaps there is some IP address conflict created by your router and the devices on the network.\nIf you are not using the WiFi/ethernet connection on the Samsung, disable WiFi or unplug the ethernet cable to remote it from your network.\n", "Q: How do I backup my Mac without a different storage device or computer? I only have my Mac which is on Catalina 10.15.7 (and my iPhone SE if that helps). How can I backup using Time Machine without anything else? I want to install bootcamp and it says I should backup my disk but I'm not sure how with the resources at hand.\n\nA: The problem is not Bootcamp per se. The problem is that in order to install another operating system on your Mac, you need to have a dedicated partition for it. And in order to get that, you have to shrink the existing partition on your drive to make room for another one, and that shrinking can irreversibly damage your data. Disk Utility is pretty good about trying to do this intelligently and not include your data in the parts that get removed when the partition is shrunk but it isn't perfect.\nSo it usually goes fine, but you're rolling the dice which is why Bootcamp gives you that warning. So the problem with your idea is this: where's that backup going to be at? Because if it's going to be on your primary partition it's subject to the same potential corruption when the shrinkage occurs.\nSo backing your data up on the same drive is out. If you're willing to potentially lose your data forever then just roll the dice and take your chances, and if you're not you can buy a very reasonably-sized external drive to use for Time Machine for a fraction of the cost of a Mac/iPhone.\n\nA: It sounds like you do not have a different storage device and cannot get one.\nOne way to backup your Mac is to use cloud storage, or cloud backup. In other words, you can use an online service to back up your data.\nIs it a requirement that you create the backup using Time Machine? Time Machine requires a different storage device, so if you cannot get a different storage device, you will probably not be able to use Time Machine.\nIf you have a backup of all your data in the cloud, then you can restore your data from there if needed. If the whole disk containing bootcamp is corrupted, you will need some way to restore your operating system (basically, restore your computer to factory settings), such as a bootable USB drive or DVD drive with a macOS install disc. Once your computer is bootable, you can connect to the internet and retrieve your backed up files.\nExamples of cloud backup providers include:\n\n*\n\n*IDrive\n\n*Backblaze\n\n*Carbonite\n\nYou may also be able to use a general online storage service, such as:\n\n*\n\n*Google Drive\n\n*Dropbox\n\n*Box\n\n\nA: Saving two copies of your files to the same drive isn’t a backup type that will protect you from a Boot Camp error.\nYou’ll want to get an inexpensive USB drive to copy your critical documents. Then when you can afford a drive that’s at least as large as your internal drive, set up Time Machine so you are protected by automatic backups of the Mac data. Note, Time Machine does not backup Boot Camp.\n", "Q: Backup file APFS - Access to files inside Backup Cluster for Windows Transfer!

So every-time I write one, it will be replaced with whatever is the closest match in the English dictionary. I can work around that by adding the abbreviations in the user dictionary (settings - general - keyboard - text replacement).\nSo I often find myself going to this setting to add a new abbreviation.\nI would like to make this a bit easier by creating a shortcut that can do it for me. So far, all I can do is a shortcut that will take me to the “text replacement” page :\nprefs:root=General&path=Keyboard/USER_DICTIONARY\n\nIt’s ok but I wish I could just ask for input and push this into the user dictionary all through the shortcut.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: I'm trying to do something similar, @remyfra.

I have an iPhone with iOS 14.3. According to Apple, I can control access by mobile apps to my Photo libraries. Apparently it works with WhatsApp, Skype Adobe and other apps. I have set the access of all apps to my photo gallery as NONE in Apple iOS Settings -> Privacy -> Photos.\nI had installed Wish app version 4.33.2 (Dev Context Logic Inc.) to make online purchases. Recently I have had to contact Wish support and I need to upload an image from my mobile photos. When I click \"Upload button\", 3 options were available, i.e., \"Photo Library\", \"Take Photo\" and \"Browse\". I selected \"Photo Library\".\nI was expecting a dialogue to ask permission to my photo library, but surprisingly, it didn't ask and I could view all my photo available to upload. I immediately checked list of apps that has requested access to Photos in my mobile privacy settings, but I cannot see the name of Wish mobile app listed there. I went to Apple settings and checked the Wish mobile app settings where I can only see Siri, Notifications, Mobile Data (in Allowed Wish to access area) and Language options.\nI then checked the option to \"Take Photo\", so I got a pop up asking permission to Camera, which I had not given. I also checked the 3rd option, i.e. \"Browse\" and I was able to access browse with Files app into my phone storage, OneDrive and iCloud drive. Amazing!\nI am unable to understand how the Wish mobile app accessed the mobile photos without first requesting the access.\n\nA: Here is a short explanation. Wish uses the PhotoKit technology provided by Apple, and more specifically the PHPickerViewController class. It's the pop-up that allows the user to upload or take a picture.\n\nSince iOS 14, this panel doesn't need any permission to display your pictures, since you have to select which one you send to Wish (or any other app); nothing is sent before you select them.\nNo need to worry, Wish can't access your pictures/camera or your cloud storages!\nIf you want to learn more about the Photo picker here is a WWDC 2020 video : https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10652/\n", "Q: Remote access to an iMac Pro So I have a friend, who has an iMac Pro with high specs at his home and I thought about accessing his iMac Pro from my Macbook Pro via some kind of remote desktop service. I would do some rather extensive video editing on that iMac Pro, for which my Macbook Pro is just too slow currently as its a rather old one from 2016. My question now is how i would be able to access that iMac Pro from my Macbook Pro, so I can basically do some kind of screen sharing and use Final Cut Pro installed on that iMac Pro. I tried downloading Remote Desktop from the store, but I can only make it work, when both of our devices are in the same network (we tried it on wifi), but I just wasnt able to make it work when we are not both in the same network, which would be the actual case at hand, because I would need to access his iMac Pro from anywhere.

I have a mid-2015 Macbook Pro running Catalina (10.15.7). (2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2 GB, Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB)\nI have an Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter.\nI would like to drive a small USB-C to Displayport Hub - so I can use two 4K Monitors, but just switch one USB-c cable when switching between my work PC (USB-C) and my Macbook Pro. (I realise I could use mini-DP to DP cables from the Mac to the monitors - but switching machines would require changing 6 displayport plugs each time you change).\nI have reason to believe this can work, based on this comment.\nMy question is: ** Can a Thunderbolt 3 (usb-c style) to Thunderbolt 2 (mini-DP style) adapter work in reverse?**\n\nA: The Apple TB3 to TB2 adapter is bi-directional, it can connect a TB2 device to a TB3 host, connect a TB3 device to TB2 host, or connect a TB3 host to TB2 host for either to be in target disk mode or to create a network between the two hosts.  What this adapter cannot do is pass DisplayPort signals, for that you need a DisplayPort adapter.  I have the Apple TB3 to TB2 adapter and tested that it will not work with DP devices, at least not my DP devices.\nWhat ports exist on this hub besides the two DP outputs?  Will you be using any ports other than the DP outputs?  There's reasons why it's difficult to find adapters to plug USB-C devices into anything other than USB-C ports.  One is that USB is host/device protocol, as opposed to peer/peer protocols like FireWire and Thunderbolt.  Another big reason is that USB-C can carry far more power than most other computer ports, things can end up not working if there's not enough power and things can end up not working (and on fire!) if too much power is applied.\nGenerally speaking Thunderbolt and DisplayPort adapters will not care which is the host and which is the device.  Thunderbolt doesn't care because it is a peer/peer protocol, the cables are usually active but there's no distinction between input and output ports.  DisplayPort cables typically do not care because the cables are passive, they just mate one port type to another with no changes to voltages or whatever.\nIf all you care about is connecting DP displays to DP hosts then you can likely find inexpensive DP adapters to do what you want.  If this hub is used for anything other than DP devices then the solution will be either impossible or expensive.\n", "Q: My Android no longer receives text messages from an iphone since signing in to imessages on my mac I have a Mac, running Big Sur. I signed in to iMessages, and sent a message to my wife's iPhone.\nNow, messages from her iPhone no longer go to my Android, and I can find no way to stop it from sending to iMessage.\nIs this a bug? How do I fix it?\n\nA: Generally only an iPhone will register your cellular number with Messages, but you can check and deregister it here:\n\n*\n\n*https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/\nOnce that’s clear, you have to be sure her app is sending to the phone number and not the email.\n\nA: Welcome to ask different. It is possible that your wife's iPhone defaults to your Apple ID/iCloud email account to send you messages instead of to your android number. To distinguish between the two, I would suggest she creates two separate contacts for you, one for your android (i.e. just mobile number with no associated email linked to the contact) and one for iMessages (i.e. your Apple ID/iCloud email account). Label the contacts something like Wife - iMessage and Wife - SMS. Unfortunately having two seperate contacts on her iPhone, will mean having two separate message conversations with her.\nThe other suggestion is for her to create a new message (rather than going into her current message conversation with you), then add contact and select your name and manually select from the dropdown options your mobile number (in green). See image below:\n\nThis will then return her to the current conversation with you, but it should send as an SMS to your android (she'll notice the send arrow will be green). She will have to do the same procedure each time to manually select your mobile number, rather than defaulting to iMessages. Subsequently, I suggest you follow the first suggestion and set two separate contacts for you on her iPhone. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Cannot erase disc in disc utility before trade in Looking for some help please.\nI am preparing my 2014 MacBook for a trade in.

I just bought a new monitor (an Asus XG35VQ), but when I try to use my MacBook (Pro 13\", mid-2014) with it, I can only get 30Hz on the native 3440x1440 resolution.\nAt first I thought there was something wrong either with the monitor or with macOS (running Big Sur), but then I realized the issue is probably with the connection.\nI want to avoid using the DisplayPort on the monitor to connect to the Mac because there is only one of them in the monitor and it's being used to connect to a different machine. All I have left is an HDMI 2.0 port. I'm using the cable that was supplied with the monitor.\nWould it help me get a better refresh rate if I used a Thunderbolt->HDMI cable instead of an HDMI->HDMI cable?

I also would not really suspect it, unless you have a reason to believe it is physically damaged.\n\n*The MBP specs also state that the output is too limited for your high refresh rate monitor. There has also been a similar question on AD:\n\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors\n\nWhat this means for you\nYou will not be able to get a higher refresh rate, since you are using an older HDMI port and the MBPs video output is too limited. So even if you would get a Mini-DP → HDMI 2.x cable, you shouldn't  be able to get a higher refresh rate.\n\nNote: On your machine the Thunderbolt 2 connector can act as a Mini-DP connector, which is capable of higher resolution/refresh rates than some older HDMI ports. Yet, this depends on the exact comparison. Have a look at the Wikipedia page about the different HDMI specifications and Display Port connections.\nDouble check which MacBooks support what monitor resolutions and refresh rates on Everymac.\n\nA: You are unlikely to see a difference in quality on the screen, but DP does over higher data throughput than HDMI 2.0 and on my mini I eliminated a problems of my HMDI connected screen not coming back after idle (some of the time) by replacing the cable with a DP -> USB-C.\nAs long as HDMI is involved, you are limited to the behavior and limits of the HDMI port.\n\nA: Thunderbolt to display port could offer a better performance in refresh rate like you said, however I would believe it to be quite minimal. I recently switched from HDMI to thunderbolt for my monitor and I don't notice a difference.\n", "Q: How to Format APFS drive using a PC so I can replace my Mac drive? I have an older iMac (Late 2012, A1418) that has a defective hard drive. I need to replace the drive and put in a fresh OS (Catalina).\nI have the install media on a USB flash drive. My problem is that the drive needs to be formatted APFS and to do this I need another Mac running High Sierra which I don’t have.\nIs there a way to format an external disk to APFS using a PC?\n\nA: If for some reason you are not able to format the drive though the OS installer:\n\n*\n\n*Replace the defective disk and connect the new disk to your Mac.\n\n\n*Use macOS Internet Recovery to boot your Mac.

(If you don't have a bootable installer on your flash drive, then you will need to create that too from recovery - How to create a bootable installer for macOS.)\n\nA: To answer your question, there are good windows software package to read and write to APFS, however you don’t need this and none seem to allow partitioning or setup like you ask.\nThe stand alone installer knows enough to run Disk Utilty and prep a drive, so you don’t need a formatted drive. When you run the installer it will detect the bare drive and offer to erase, format, partition and install the OS.\nJust boot up the installer and connect the new drive. It can be internally connected or externally connected and the installer will do the correct erase and format for you.\nYour Mac might even be able to boot to internet recovery to get Disk Utility to partition the disk with zero local bootable OS or installers.

The command to do so is:\nconvert image.jpg -resize '2000x2000^>' image-resized.jpg\n\nThe 2000x2000^ resizes the image so that its shortest side is at least 2000 pixels.

Due to Covid-19 I'm holding my lectures as webinar from my iMac (WebEx, Zoom, ...). Meanwhile my setup works, but there is one thing I miss a lot: Drawing sketches in front of the class while I talk about it.\nNow, that I own an iPad + Pencil I'm looking for any Mac app that would allow me to\n\n*\n\n*sketch on the iPad (simple, symbolic stuff, just like scribbles on a white board)\n\n*while talking on the conference software\n\n*see my drawing in a window on the Mac in (kind of...) real time (I can put on the shared screen of my conference software)\n\nAny ideas?\n[Edit: iMac 27“ 2020, iPad Air 4 (2020), Pencil 2)]\n\nA: Thanks to the keyword \"Airplay\", that Morgan Rogers dropped, I found another way I want to document here (but maybe someone still has a better idea ;-) ):\nI remembered there was an app called X-Mirage that works as an airplay receiver app for MacOS. So I can set up X-Mirage as a Airplay receiver and send from the iPad from any sketching App I choose (Notability looks promising). A short test setup was very promising.\nThis way I am totally independent of\n\n*\n\n*the choice of sketching app on the iPad\n\n*the choice of conference software (as long as it can share my mac screen)\n\n\nA: The best tool I have found for this is the iPad app Notability (I am not affiliated, I am a math professor who is also giving all lectures on Zoom). When I share the screen in Zoom (on my Mac), I am able to select \"iPad over AirPlay\" as the source for the share.\nNotability has a \"presentation mode\" where you can see the UI to select colors, tools, etc. but it broadcasts through the screen share with the UI hidden (in essentially real time). Zoom works really nice here, your video is broadcast on the side of your \"whiteboard\" surface.\nNotability has some nice tools, and works really well with the pencil (I am using an older iPad pro with the first gen pencil). You can use it to simply draw, you can have it do shape recognition and clean up stuff like rectangles, circles, triangles, etc, options to do straight lines. I am using it for my math classes and like it a lot.\n\nA: Astropad lets you use your iPad as a monitor for you Mac that you can \"draw\" on with your stylus.\nThere are integrations for a few apps built in, otherwise it can simulate mouse clicks / movement.\n\nA: Since Notability has been mentioned in a previous post it is fair to give GoodNotes 5 (V5.8) a chance. I am also in a similar situation (as the OP) and I use GoodNotes for years (even before Covid-19) not only for my lectures. I use it for meetings, calculations, etc. almost for everything - in fact, I do not need any real paper. Long calculations within a split mode where you can see different parts of the same (or even different) paper are no problem at all.\nActually, GoodNotes together with the brand new 12' iPad Pro was a change in my workflow.\nIn contrast to Notability, in GoodNotes you have the option to move and change folders and papers to other folders/places (nested folder structure). And yes, GoodNotes has also a presentation mode with various laser pointer options, etc.\nIn my opinion one of the best apps for the iPad (actually it is also a Editors' choice).\nJust check it out and compare.\n", "Q: How to mass apply No Access to all folders but one for a specific user account only? (This is just experimenting for educational purposes.)\nI'm the admin of the computer and I have SIP disabled. I wish to imitate iOS restrictions on macOS by prohibiting access (to one other specific user account, not me) to all directories except for 'Downloads' of their equivalent 'Users' folder.\nYes, the apps they launch can freely read/write from/to 'Library' and other system-related files as they normally would, but the user just never gets to access those directories (pretty much like iOS minus the sandboxed app-data)\nWhen using Finder (or any other file browser) they can only access their Downloads folder.\nManaging their system (installing/uninstalling apps etc.) is of lesser importance as I, the admin, can do it for them when asked.\nI think I can implement this by applying a 'No Access' rule to their user account for all directories, which attaches a red flag icon to the folder and does not allow one to access it when clicked.\nInstead of going through every single folder to do this with cmd+I, can I do this with Terminal for all directories minus 'Downloads'?\n\nA: Any access on macOS is running with the credentials of the user owning a process, so you can't prohibit user access to e.g. ~/Documents or ~/Library while still allowing applications started by the same user from accessing content stored there. I've never tried but removing user access from ~/Library most likely will even prevent the user from logging in (in a probably unpleasant way).\nThis is vastly different from sandboxing on iOS where each app basically has it's own sandboxed space within the filesystem (which ensures that app A can't access data of app B unless both are coded specifically to support this) and where app-specific preferences etc are stored within the sandbox itself.\n", "Q: Run everything in Rosetta 2 on Silicon Mac I've recently started using a Silicon MacBook Pro 13 (i.e. one with non-Intel processor).\nI have found installing some software difficult, for example installing Python through Homebrew and installing Python packages through Pip.\nAlso, for some software there exist ports to the new architecture, but these ports contain bugs, for example, the Tensorflow package for Python.\nI also use an IDE that runs some Python commands and some Terminal commands for me, and I find it very difficult to manage the usage of Rosetta 2 for these commands.\nIs there a way to set up my Mac so that all software behaves as it would on an Intel processor?\nFor example by using Rosetta 2 for every processor instruction?\nI understand that would mean substantial performance losses, but I would be happy to accept these.\n\nA: Sharing my experience from installing brew, node, mysql and php.\nI hope, it will be applicable for others also:\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and navigate to Application/ Utilities\n\n*Duplicate the terminal application by clicking with two fingers on the app and rename it to Rosetta Terminal\n\n*Now right click on Rosetta Terminal and click on Get Info\n\n*Now from the Get info menu, check \"Open using Rosetta\" option\n\n*Run command arch in both terminals\n\n*Make sure, you get i386 on Rosetta Terminal (Intel processor) and arm64 on Native Terminal (Apple Silicon)\n\n*Always install all the applications/packages in the Rosetta Terminal (e.g. brew, node) and use them in Native terminal.\n\nIn my experience, you must follow step 7 - otherwise you may get an installation error.\nSource - Chris Gradwohl's blog\n\nGo through Chris Gradwohl's blog and you will not regret it.\nP.S. Be aware, Rosetta terminal will behave the same as the native terminal - for that just select the checkbox (Open using Rosetta) again (my personal experience).\n\nA: *\n\n*In Finder, go to /Applications/Utilities/ (or press CMD+Shift+U).\n\n\n*Select \"Terminal.app\"\n\n\n*Press CMD+I (capital i) for \"Get Info\"\n\n\n*Check box for \"Open using Rosetta\"\nAs shown here:\n\nAfter that, any process in Terminal will behave as if it is on an Intel Mac. This is the best way to run brew right now, and they have said that there will be a process to move over to ARM when the time comes.\nIf there are other apps that are compiled for both Apple Silicon and Intel, but you always want to run them under Rosetta, repeat the \"Get Info\" » \"Open in Rosetta\" process for each app.\n", "Q: Why does macOS Mojave change a group's name automatically? Created a user group called \"Duo\". When I add it to a directory, macOS Mojave (10.14.6) automatically changes the name to \"Dev\".\n\nEven id says my user is group \"Dev\" (and not \"Duo\" as it was named):\n$ id\nuid=502(s) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),505(Dev) ...\n\nWhat's actually happening here?\n\nA: Figured it out. I had originally created a group called Dev and then immediately renamed it to Duo through Users & Groups in System Preferences. But appparently this only makes a cosmetic change in the gui. I don't know if this is an expected behaviour by design or a bug on macOS Mojave 10.14.6 ...\nTo reproduce it:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Users & Groups from the Apple menu.\n\n*Click the Lock icon and unlock as an administrator.\n\n*Click the + icon (below Login Options).\n\n*Select Group from the drop down menu of New Account.\n\n*Enter a name for the group in Full Name and click Create Group.\n\n*The new group will be immediately listed in the sidebar, under Groups.\n\n*Click on the newly created group name in the sidebar.\n\n*In the Name field, change the name of the group to something else.\n\nExpected: macOS Mojave renames the group name.\nWhat actually happens: macOS Mojave doesn't actually change the group name in the system and continues to use the original group name. But it shows the renamed group name in the macOS GUI (in Users & Groups).\nTip: To actually change the group name through Users & Groups, you have to right-click the group name in the sidebar, and click on Advanced Options and input the new name in Group name and click OK. (This introduces another weird behavior / bug for me - if you right-click and change the name through the Advanced Options, it won't be shown again to you in the same session - i.e. right-clicking the group name after renaming it won't show a right-click menu again.)\n\nA: Update: this was written based on an entirely incorrect interpretation of the OP's situation. Leaving it here anyway as a treatise on the difference between Contacts groups and directory groups.\n\nSince it looks like you are trying to configure file permissions, you probably want to be using System Preferences to view and edit system groups, instead of Contacts to view and edit contacts groups.\nTo answer your question about what's going on: for the purposes of this discussion, macOS supports two different kinds of groups: contacts groups and directory groups. While they are pretty different, they have one thing in common: both provide a way to refer to a collection of one or more records - however the type of record supported by each is quite different, and these two different kinds of group records are not interchangeable.\n\n*\n\n*A Contacts group (formerly known as 'AddressBook group') is a list of one or more contact records. A contacts group provides a shortcut for addressing multiple contacts at once, for example when composing an email or group text. When you supply a contacts group as the recipient for an email, the group immediately expands to the list of individual records it contains, which is the exact same result you'd get as if you typed each address individually. Contacts groups are generally only useful for this purpose, as they can only contain contact records, which don't have all the attributes needed to do other things related to users or groups. Contacts records are stored in the contacts database, which is not used for any other purpose.\n\n*\"Directory groups\" (aka \"directory services groups\", \"unix groups\", \"system groups\") are a more traditional and flexible record type, commonly used when configuring access privileges to files or services. Directory groups contain user records (and / or other group records), which support a very rich set of attributes that go far beyond just contact-related information. User records define the set of names and passwords that can be used for authentication, while group records define lists of users that can be authorized to access some resource or perform some action. Directory services records are stored in directory services databases which may be local or remote; on macOS, access to this data is brokered by opendirectoryd.\n\nI am tiptoeing around a complication that probably doesn't matter for your situation, but just for completeness: user records can also hold contact-related information, and can be used in many of the same ways as contacts records. By extension, the same is true of group records, which can also participate in contact-related workflows. macOS can bridge multiple different sources of contact information, so for example when addressing an email, macOS can search across local contact and contact group records, and also search a remote LDAP server that holds contacts records, and also a remote LDAP server that holds directory services records. This kind of thing can be configured with Directory Utility - in particular, note that the search path for authentication can be configured separately from the search path for contacts.\n", "Q: Does the Mac still only have one hardware video decoder for the first video, and then it will be software decoder that is used? I remember in the past, a PC had one hardware decoder, and say, if any video is being shown, such as on YouTube, iTunes, or perhaps even just a video ad on the web browser, then the hardware video decoder could be used and already busy.\nAnd if that video is paused, and the user start to watch a movie, then the hardware video decoder cannot be used and the software one would be used, and it possibly would not be as smooth as the hardware decoder.\nIf it is the Mac or MacBook, would it be the same? For example, if it is a mid 2014 MacBook Pro, probably with Intel Iris Graphics, or a late 2015 iMac 27 inch with AMD Radeon R9 M380, would it be the same situation?  However, if I look at the Processor graph when some YouTube video is being paused and then I play another movie from a streaming provider like Netflix or Disney+, then I see that out of the 8 cores (4 of them virtual), 4 cores were at about 40%, and the rest of the 4 cores are near 0. So would that mean the processor itself can decode the video with ease, and therefore no hardware decoding is needed? Does the GPU participate in it, when (1) it is the only video being played, or (2) when there are multiple videos and all are paused except one?\n\nA: Yes, depending on the specs it often does have only one hardware media decoder. This is either integrated in the CPU (Intel processors) or on a graphic card. (Note that some graphic cards can have more than one hardware media decoder / encoder).\nBut that hardware decoder can play multiple streams of media, upto a limit, before the OS is forced to switch to the CPU (software rendering).\nThe limit though depends on the hardware decoders capability. For example, if a particular hardware media decoder claims it can decode a 1080p H.264 videos at 600 fps, then you should theoretically be able to play ten 1080p videos of 60fps (600/60 = 10) simultaneously on it.\nOfcourse, all this depends on the app playing the media and even on the OS.\nFor example, on Google's Chrome browser Youtube will often send you a VP8/9 encoded video or a H.264 encoded video depending on whether your laptop is running on battery or main power (H.264 consumes less power than VP8, so if you are running on battery, Youtube on Chrome will opt for H.264). If your hardware decoder can't decode VP8/9 the OS will switch to CPU software rendering. Many media players have an option to explcitly enable Hardware Acceleration (to decode videos through the hardware decoder), and if this is not enabled, then the media player app will use the CPU (for software decoding) even if your computer has a hardware decoder.\nIt's not that easy to test as there are many other such factors at play too - can you open 10+ videos? Is your hard disk or internet fast enough to all play 10+ videos? Will the OS hang? And so on ...\n", "Q: Apple TV Screen Mirroring not working from iPad Every time I select Screen Mirroring from the Control Center and select my Apple TV from the list, it shows that the screen is being mirrored to my TV (there is a checkmark next to the name of the Apple TV), but nothing happens on the Apple TV.

I can’t see any way to know from the phone (or the AP) if the phone is using a WiFi 6 connection or not.\n\nA: Unfortunately, iOS doesn't show this information to the user and, due to the restrictive nature of iOS, it is not accessible in any easy manner.\nBut there is a way to figure it out. Your Ubiquiti UniFi 6 Lite AP router supports WiFi 6. And WiFi 6 comes with an enhanced security feature called WPA3 Personal (for home use). And iOS 13 and above supports WPA3 Personal.\nIn your router, make sure your WiFi network is secured with a password through WPA3 Personal. Then, if you can successfully connect your iPhone 11 to your Wifi with this password (set through WPA 3 Personal), you can be relatively sure that your iPhone 11 has connected to your router on Wifi 6 (i.e. established a wifi connection on 802.11ax).\n\nA: In a nutshell, WiFi 6 is a marketing term for 802.11ax and the fastest way to know it’s working is to check radio details on the Ubiquity app and know exactly which encoding scheme is used from moment to moment. The radios adapt and steer traffic based on interference and other radios which change constantly.\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax\nEven with WiFi 6 available, if you’re stuck behind a slow router, a well engineered device might connect in a more power-efficient manner until it needs extra speed.\nBoth Apple and Ubiquity have a long track record of working together well -  in the end, I recommend you look at the WiFi quality on Ubuiquity side and check your iOS device MAC address in the UniFi App and check your transmit rate / channel / RSSI to make sure your speeds are negotiating to the fast speeds you expect. As long as WiFi is faster than your server connection, it likely won’t matter if you’re on 5 or 6 flavor of the technical / marketing side of things.\nTo illustrate this recommendation:\n\nI currently have a 802.11ac connection so the 866 MBps means I’m either running MCS 9 with two spatial streams and 256-QAM modulation on 80 MHz channels with 400ns GI or MCS 9 with one spatial stream on a 160 MHz channel and the other radio parameters the same. Since WiFi 6 includes older standards, you could argue I’m already using a WiFi 6 connection with my hardware for this specific answer.\n\nA: In the newest software on the Ubiquiti Cloud Key Network Controller it now shows the type of WiFi connection that each device is using. You can see this by going to the 'Topology' section of the interface:\n\n", "Q: iCloud has sucked up all my laptop's files - can you transfer files directly from iCloud to Google Drive? I'm trying to disconnect my macbook from iCloud, as it's been creating some problems.  I was told by an Apple Support employee that doing so is only recommended once you've backed up everything from your Mac somewhere, to ensure you don't lose any files - so my goal is to upload everything to Google Drive before messing with my laptop's iCloud settings.\nThe problem is, almost none of the projects that I want to back up to Google Drive are truly on my laptop - instead I mostly just have folders full of file names, which are placeholders for the real files that have been sucked into iCloud. This means I have to re-download everything to my computer before uploading it all to Google Drive. Another crucial piece of information is that I only have 1 GB of storage left on my macbook, which prevents me from re-downloading any complete projects/folders at a time.\nSo unfortunately my current method is this: downloading 1-5 files at a time, uploading these few things to Google Drive, deleting the copies from my laptop and trash, repeat (thousands of times). So, I was wondering if anyone could offer any alternative methods for uploading stuff to Google Drive in this situation - for example, is there a way to transfer files directly from iCloud to Google Drive without having to download them to my laptop first?\nI should probably mention that I've scoured my laptop for duplicated files and applications I no longer use, make sure to empty my trash regularly, etc (I also asked Apple Support to help me make sure I wasn't missing out on any other ways to maximize storage space). The most obvious culprit of my lack of space is the massive 150 GB iCloud folder on my laptop, which appears to contain duplicates of everything on my computer. I can't seem to do anything about it until I've disconnected from iCloud itself (its reasons for existence are unclear to me in the first place...but that's beside the point lol).\n\nA: I have to agree with the comments:\n1.) Get an external drive\n2.) Offload or delete what you can on your mac.\n3.) download some stuff you need, copy it to a local harddrive (out of iCloud), delete it in iCloud, then upload to Google Drive.\n4.) Repeat 3.) until done.\niCloud can take a long time to sync up completely, so be patient.\nHere is what Apple has to say: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206996\n", "Q: How much space does a mac os update occupy after installation? I am currently running mac OS Catalina 10.15.3 and I want to update to Big Sur, however, it needs a lot of space and I am actually limited on space as I have a 128 GBs laptop (big mistake, I know), my question is: will installing this new update really take as much space as indicated (for downloading I need to free up around 15 GBs then for installing the download file I need like 20-25 GBs more), will this space be forever occupied or will the old files of Catalina be deleted and I will have relatively the same amount of space before and after updating\n\nA: While installations of macOS do vary in size slightly, the previous operating system files are removed as part of the upgrade. You shouldn't expect a noticeable decrease in space available after upgrading to Big Sur.\n\nA: When you update the OS from one major version to the next, many of the files will be over-written by new files with the same names. Some may be deleted.\nEach new OS should take roughly the same amount of space, though some may vary. Catalina didn't have 32-bit libraries, so may be smaller than Mojave; Big Sur has Universal binaries for Intel and Apple Silicon, so may be a little bit bigger.\nBut essentially, the amount of space should be similar. Upgrading from an earlier OS doesn't take up more space than a new install. (Apart from all your stuff, of course.)\nBig Sur is 12 Gb download, according to the Apple Store. It appears that it requests around 35 Gb of free space in addition to this at installation. You should normally (i.e. all the time) keep 10-20% of the disk as free space, to allow for temporary file writing, and SSD self-management.\n", "Q: Shortcut to toggle KeyboardViewer with AppleScript on Big Sur I am trying to create a shortcut that toggles Keyboard Viewer with Automator.

Let's say, for what ever reason, System Preferences.app is already activated (with, for example, window Sharing/ Remote Management/ Computer Settings open) but not visible or not front most or whatever. In Script Editor, you try to run tell application \"System Preferences\" to reveal anchor \"SpeakableItems\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\" That command completes with no obvious errors but when you switch over to System Preferences, your \"revealed anchor\" is not revealed. Ok, no big deal, easy fix. I'll just insert a tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit command prior to the reveal anchorcommand. Running the updated code this time, you get a (userCanceledErr:-128) error. All of this hassle is because that secondary drop down window in System Preferences is open. In my opinion, the do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\" command seems to be the best solution.\n\nHere is another option if you have the “Show Accessibility status in menu bar” checked in System Preferences/Accessibility.

(I did try closing it using additional other methods but this was the least problematic, and why I needed up with it.)\nTo use the example AppleScript code I saved it as Toggle Accessibility Keyboard.scpt in ~/Library/Scripts/ and trigger it with a keyboard shortcut of ⌃⌥⌘K using FastScripts, however, an Automator Service/Quick Action can be created using a Run AppleScript action and the code, along with a keyboard shortcut assigned in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nWhat the example AppleScript code does:\n\n*\n\n*Checks to see if the Accessibility Keyboard is showing by reading com.apple.HIToolbox plist file to see if com.apple.inputmethod.AssistiveControl exists, as it does when it's showing, and not when it's not showing.\n\n\n*If it's showing, it calls the closeVirtualKeyboard handler which programmatically gets the position and size of the Close button of the Accessibility Keyboard in order to click it, using cliclick, where ever it is on the display.\n\n\n*If it's not showing, it calls the openVirtualKeyboard handler to show it.\nExample AppleScript code:\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"defaults read com.apple.HIToolbox\", ¬\n    \" | \", ¬\n    \"grep -o 'com.apple.inputmethod.AssistiveControl'\", ¬\n    \"; exit 0\"} as string\n\nset foo to (do shell script shellCMD)\n\n\nif not foo is equal to \"\" then\n    closeVirtualKeyboard()\nelse\n    my openVirtualKeyboard()\nend if\n\non closeVirtualKeyboard()\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set ps to {position, size} of ¬\n            button \"Close\" of window \"Panel\" of ¬\n            application process \"Assistive Control\"\n        set x to (item 1 of item 1 of ps) + ¬\n            (item 1 of item 2 of ps) / 2 as integer\n        set y to (item 2 of item 1 of ps) + ¬\n            (item 2 of item 2 of ps) / 2 as integer\n        set shellCMD to ¬\n            {\"/usr/local/bin/cliclick -r c:\", x, \",\", y} ¬\n                as string\n        tell me to do shell script shellCMD\n    end tell\nend closeVirtualKeyboard\n\non openVirtualKeyboard()\n    if running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n        try\n            tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n        on error\n            do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n        end try\n    end if\n    delay 0.1\n    repeat while running of application \"System Preferences\" is true\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to ¬\n        reveal anchor \"Virtual_Keyboard\" in ¬\n            pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        repeat until (exists checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\" of ¬\n            tab group 1 of group 1 of window \"Accessibility\" of ¬\n            application process \"System Preferences\")\n            delay 0.01\n        end repeat\n        click checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\" of ¬\n            tab group 1 of group 1 of window \"Accessibility\" of ¬\n            application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\nend openVirtualKeyboard\n\n", "Q: Connecting to a device console using screen shows no output I am trying to access a network device console from my mac using a Prolific Technology USB-serial adapter to the device's console.

I have used this successfully for years to make text editing more Emacs-like, but there is one feature I have never been able to get to work: the yankAndSelect: method.  It never cycles through the kill ring for me; it always only yanks the last-killed item. I am looking for help to make it work.\nHere is how I tested it.  First, I set NSTextKillRingSize using this command in a terminal:\ndefaults write -g NSTextKillRingSize -int 20\n\n(I've also tried -string instead of -int in the command above, but it makes no difference in the behavior.)  Next, I removed everything from my DefaultKeyBinding.dict file and left only this:\n{\n  \"^y\" = (yankAndSelect:);\n}\n\nNote that I leave controlk bound to its default text system action (which is to kill to the end of the line).  Finally, I rebooted, just to be absolutely sure nothing unexpected persisted.\nBased on many sources, such as Apple's documentation,  the two documents on customizing the Cocoa text system and the list of selectors by Jacob Rus from 2006, Brett Terpstra's KeyBindings, and random other people's pages on the web, it seems that the following behavior should be seen (as described by Brett Terpstra):\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit (restart it if it was already open)\n\n*Type a line of text, move the cursor to the start of the line, type controlk\n\n*Write another line with different text, and repeat step 2\n\n*Do it one more time\n\n*On a blank line, type controly. This should paste the last line you killed\n\n*Type controly again, and the pasted text should be replaced by the second line you killed\n\n*Again, and you should see the first line. Continuing repetitions will cycle through the kill ring.\n\nThis is not what happens in my use.  Instead, what happens is that step #6 does not paste the 2nd-to-last kill, but rather the most recent (3rd) kill – always.  It is as if there is no kill ring at all, and yankAndSelect: always only yanks the most recent kill.\nThis is 100% repeatable behavior in every system (macOS 10.13, and an almost-fresh 10.14 VM) and every application that respects DefaultKeyBinding.dict (not only TextEdit) that I've tried.\nWhat more must be done to get yankAndSelect: to cycle through the kill ring?\n\nA: Update: It seems that on some versions of macOS, setting the configuration globally doesn't work; instead, use defaults write com.apple.TextEdit NSTextKillRingSize -string 6 (replacing com.apple.TextEdit with the desired application and 6 with the desired kill ring size) to set it on a per-app basis. Additionally, it appears that NSTextKillRingSize must be no greater than 16 or it will not work.\n\nOriginal answer:\nThe issue appears to lie in how the defaults CLI handles the global defaults domain. Specifically, you want to write to the correct host's global defaults (i.e., yours), which it seems doesn't occur by default. (I still don't fully understand the intricacies of how all this works.) To accomplish this, replace your current defaults write command with the following:\ndefaults -currentHost write -g NSTextKillRingSize -string 6\n\nThis worked for me on Big Sur 11.1.\n", "Q: My MacBook shows the screensaver seemingly forever!

To set this for Finder, use com.apple.finder as the domain.\nDisclaimer (from the comments):\n\nI always wish “killall Finder” had a disclaimer.

Hello,\ncan you guys help me\n\nI did factory reset also I used OmniDiskSweeper did not help\n\n\n\nA: ‘Other Volumes in Container’ are other volumes independent from your currently booted operating system and its data volume.\nIn your case diskutil list shows disk1s5 and disk1s7 as additional Data volumes. Check the contents of these volumes in Finder (or with OmniDiskSweeper pointed at these volumes instead).\n", "Q: I only see a .pkg file when restoring from DMG in TransMac. What is wrong? I finally got my hands on a second-hand MacBook Pro (Early 2011). However, the disk is corrupted and doesn't boot, and Internet Recovery proves ineffective as the OS X Lion Setup fails. This is the only somewhat-modern Mac that I own, so I tried to make a USB installer via windows. I used a genuine Apple install DMG (Located Here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683), and when I go and restore the USB with the DMG file I only see a .pkg file, in place of the installer files. It also doesn't show up in the boot menu of the Macbook.\nI have seen other people have success with this method, so I'm not seeing what I'm doing wrong. (See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OpF0jJMJzI) What should I do differently?\n\nA: I found a quicker and easier way to do this, so I'll share it here.\nI found a website called https://bootableinstaller.com/, and it works like magic. If you run the script (Included with download), it converts the installer DMG into a bootable ISO.\nAs for my original problem:\nIt looks like I tried to flash the installer DMG without unpacking the .PKG file properly. The script mentioned above does that for me.\n", "Q: Terminal output messed up on Big Sur my terminal is showing output in weird way and I don't know what it is called, so couldn't find similar question on this site, so pardon me for asking again.\nThis is the output on my terminal on MacOS 11.1 Big Sur:\n\nAs you can see the words are wrapped at first character.\nI tried changing following things to fix: font, Oh-my-zsh theme. None worked.\nMy configuration for the terminal are:\n\n*\n\n*Use Zsh - the default theme. .zshrc contents here\n\n*Use oh-my-zsh for the prompt and theme is powerlevel10k. Used robbyrussell theme for screen shot.\n\n*Font is Fira Mono, size 18.\n\nPlease tell me if I am missing something here to provide more details of my setup. Thank you.\n\nA: I actually found out that the cause of the issue was this line tabs 4 in .zshrc. This worked on very well for me on Linux using Konsole terminal. I had copied my code configs from Linux after switching.\nUpdate:\nI found out that MacOS terminal uses negative values to the tabs command instead of positive. So for example, for width of 4 spaces, it should tabs -4. On Linux, it should be tabs 4 to achieve the same.\n\nA: Such small config issues are difficult to diagnose and resolve. What might help is\n\n*\n\n*Rollback init files to last good version (e.g. by getting them from Time Machine)\n\n*Start a shell without init files (bash --noprofile/zsh -d -f)\n\n*Rename existing init files and rebuild them line by line\n\n", "Q: convert all paragraphs using a style How can I convert all paragraphs using a style to another style?\nI have a Document using \"Default\" style with justification set.\nI want to change all to plain left justified.\nI have created a new Style with the desired features.\n\nA: The short answer to your question is: Select each block and apply the new style.\nBut once we are talking about more than a few blocks of text, it's easier to change the current style than to apply a new style.\nTo do that:\nWhen you have the format sidebar open and you make format changes to a defined style (in your case \"Default\"), the name of the style in the dropdown menu  at the top gets an asterisk (\"*\") and an \"Update\" button.\nWhen you click that button, the style gets updated and through that all the elements that use that style get updated as well.\nIf you want to discard the style change instead, just select the name of the style again in the dropdown.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina upgrade install with macOS Yosemite is stuck at macOS Catalina will be installed on disk I am installing Mac OS Catalina on Mac OS mid 2012 as upgrade install from Mac OS Yosemite It has stuck for about 3 hours now at finishing bar of macOS Catalina will be installed on disk Kindly guide what to do\nscreenshot of where installation is got stuck\n\nscreenshot of laptop specifications\n\n\nA: I'd suggest patience proportional to the time since your last backup.\nCatalina will reformat the drive into new partition types. Interrupting that is going to mean starting over.\nIf you're lucky, the time it's taking is simply the time needed to reformat. macOS since maybe High Sierra or Mojave really expects to be running on an SSD, so there's going to be considerable additional time penalty whilst it does this conversion on an HD.\nIf your backup is good, you could consider dumping this attempt & start over with El Capitan, which is considered minimum OS from which to jump to Catalina. I'm somewhat surprised the installer didn't prevent you from going ahead, though I've never attempted to jump this far myself, so I don't know how the installer should react to the attempt.\n", "Q: How much video can you record on a 64 GB iPhone 12? I’m considering a phone upgrade, but don’t really need a lot of storage.\nApproximately, how much of different resolutions video, can one record onto a 64GB iPhone 12?\nHow many minutes of video would a gigabyte of HDR Video Recording with “Dolby Vision” contain? How can I research this without knowing the technical specifics of a format I cannot access until I purchase a phone?\nI’m not looking for very exact answers, just an approximation of HD video sizes and lengths in the context of the camera tech used in this specific phone.\n\nA: The Camera settings on iPhone 12 shows\n\n*\n\n*4K @ 60fps is 440MB per minute.\n\n*4K @ 30fps is 190MB per minute.\n\nI don’t have an iPhone 12 to know exactly how much space is reserved by iOS but supposing it’s 15 GB that leaves 110 minutes of 4k60 or 257 minutes of 4k30.\n\n\nA: In addition to the other answers, in iOS's camera settings there's a little summary of the amount of data each minute of video at different resolutions/FPS. You can see this summary of how much space it takes per each minute of video in Settings>Camera>Record Video\nThis is what is says for my iPhone XS, so it would be different on an iPhone 12 with the latest hardware.\n\n", "Q: Applescript - Code to solve the Daily Telegraph 'Safe Cracker' puzzle I don't know if anyone is going to be interested in this (or if it the correct place to post it!).

This answer is mostly advice (with a few facts).\nDisk Utility is not able to modify the partition scheme on a disk which is using the Master Boot record (MBR) partitioning scheme. Hence the Partition button is not available for a previously partitioned MBR disk.  Disk Utility can only erase the disk.  There are command line tools to modify MBR partitions, but I will treat them as out of scope.\nThat answers the title question.  But there is more worth saying.\nFor macOS it is best to use the GUID Partition Map scheme (as Disk Utility calls it).  This requires erasing the disk, creating a single partition.\nWith a GUID partition scheme, the Partition button in Disk Utility becomes active.  This allows the creation of more partitions.  That allows duplication on the Samsung T5 of the partitioning of the old disk with one HFS+ formatted partition and one exFAT formatted partition.\nBut, unless there are pressing reasons (e.g. compatibility with a Windows computer) it is best not to use exFAT format with macOS.\nFurther, and assuming this is just for use on a Mac, there are advantages to using the APFS format with recent versions of macOS rather than the HFS format.\nMy recommendation is to use Disk Utility to erase the new Samsung T5 to have a GUID partition scheme and the APFS format.  This creates an APFS formatted container with a single volume inside.\nIf additional volumes are required they can be added to the APFS container. The volumes will share the container.  New partitions do not need to be created.\nFolders and their files can be copied from the old volumes to the new volume on the T5 using Finder.\nFrom experience, I have found that Disk Utility's Restore is tricky to use for disk to disk transfers.  Better to limit its use to restoring a disk from an image file.\n", "Q: shortcut for starting and stopping youtube video on second screen on mac I often watch tutorial videos from youtube on my macbook.\nSo i want to watch the tutorial on my second display and work on my macbook.\nBecause i often have to start and continue the video i always have to move my cursor back to the other monitor and then tap on the small start button and move back to my macbook display.\ni would love to have a shortcut e.g. option-s which starts/stops video or maybe two, one to start, one to stop.\nis this possible?\n\nA: YouTube videos are correctly detected as media in Safari, so the media keys will control playback.

Instead of “macOS Utilities,” it shows “OS X Utilities.”\nWhen I clicked the “Disk Utility,” I can’t find the HD disk I’m using.\nCan someone please help me on how can I successfully reset my MacBook Pro?\nAdditional information:\n\n*\n\n*My MacBook Pro built-in keyboard is already faulty. The left Shift key always functioning (meaning always on press) so download Karabiner-Elements to disabled my left Shift key.\n\n*I don’t have any external keyboard for MacBook. Sometimes I used a Windows keyboard when needed. I tried to use a Windows keyboard to press the Command + R to enter the recovery mode but no luck that’s why I tried the Internet Recovery (Command + Option + R) using the built-in MacBook Pro keyboard.\n\n\nA: I can guess what's happening, but not how to fix it, short of physically disconnecting the keyboard.\nThe startup commands are…\n\n*\n\n* Cmd ⌘  R\nreinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version\n\nThis first one is in fact loading from your existing recovery partition.\nThese next two go online for Internet Recovery\n\n*\n\n* Opt ⌥   Cmd ⌘  R\nupgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n* Shift ⇧   Opt ⌥   Cmd ⌘  R\nreinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version nearest to it that is still available.\n\nPressing  Opt ⌥   Cmd ⌘  R for the latest OS is adding your stuck shift key (because Karabiner isn't loaded yet to prevent it), meaning you get  Shift ⇧   Opt ⌥   Cmd ⌘  R  which is trying to install a version of the OS (presumably 10.10) too old to read your APFS drive.\nI can only guess that  Shift ⇧   Cmd ⌘  R is not being recognised as anything at all.\n\nA: I have some possible solutions. The second option is probably simplest (if nothing goes wrong), but if it doesn't work, having an installer drive (first option) will give you a lot more options. So I recommend at least starting the first option.\nOption 1: Create an installer drive\nSee Apple Support Document HT201372: \"How to create a bootable installer for macOS\" for full instructions. In summary, download the macOS installer application from the Mac App Store, plug in a flash drive that can be erased (because it will be), and run something like:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\nEnter your admin password when prompted (it won't echo), and follow the prompts.\nWhen that's finished, select that drive in System Preferences -> Startup Disk, and restart. (Normally, you could hold Option at startup, and then select it; but having Shift stuck down seems to prevent this.)\nOption 2: Select recovery mode with an NVRAM setting\nYou can do this by hand in the Terminal utility, with the command:\nsudo usr/sbin/nvram internet-recovery-mode=RecoveryModeNetwork\n\nEnter your admin password when prompted (it won't echo). If you don't want to mess with Terminal, Tim Perfitt of TwoCanoes software made a free Recovery Selector utility that'll do it for you.\nEither way, restart, and it should start in Internet Recovery mode without any keys. You might or might not need to reset it back to normal by opening Terminal (from the Utilities menu in Recovery mode), and running:\nsudo /usr/sbin/nvram -d internet-recovery-mode\n\n\nA: This is because Apple pulled the Big Sur images and is only serving Catalina recovery from its content delivery network (CDN) or because you fall back to an earlier recovery that’s local to your setup.\nTechnical details are here: https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-big-sur-internet-recovery-unavailable-replaced-with-catalina/\n\n*\n\n*Your windows keyboard is just fine and won’t help if you get an Apple keyboard.\n\n*You can still erase your hard drive from Catalina and then reinstall either OS. Just erase the entire drive. Worst case, you may need a second Mac to handle things until Apple pushes out Big Sur recovery. That second Mac can use Apple Configurator or Target Disk Mode to erase and install things for you.\n\n", "Q: Service only application I want to build a simple service that will allow me to keep any app window always on top or always on the same screen, when switching desktops.\nIs there a way to build a global MacOS service-only application (without any windows etc.) and how is the preferred way to do this? (Automator, AppKit, SwiftUI).\nThe app should also be distributable via AppStore (or if not possible just GitHub).\n\nA: You could build such a service using any tool that results in an application bundle; this includes AppleScript/JavaScript (OSA), Objective-C, and Swift. Apple would likely prefer you used Swift.\nInvestigate the Accessibility APIs for interacting and manipulating windows owned by other applications.\nSee the Info.plist value LSUIElement for making an agent application:\n\nLSUIElement (Boolean - macOS) specifies whether the app runs as an agent app. If this key is set to YES, Launch Services runs the app as an agent app. Agent apps do not appear in the Dock or in the Force Quit window. Although they typically run as background apps, they can come to the foreground to present a user interface if desired. A click on a window belonging to an agent app brings that app forward to handle events.\nThe Dock and loginwindow are two apps that run as agent apps.\n\nTo be distributed on Apple's Mac App Store, an application must have a user interface. This can be a simple window that enables your service, or handles preferences.\nSearch GitHub for status menu app for open source examples.\n", "Q: Problem with iCloud Drive \"Desktop and Documents folder\" check box not sticking I have a problem very similar to What could cause iCloud Drive to refuse to sync Desktop & Documents?.

When he is logged out2 of his user account and I look at the activity monitor in my account, there are several processes owned by his user that are still running:\n\nWhen I took the screenshot3, the processes were all at 0% CPU, but I noticed them because com.apple.geod briefly rose to the top with around 5% or 10% CPU.\nIn fact, I only started up the activity monitor to check whether another process owned by my son was active again. He is playing Fortnite on this MacBook and a few days ago, after he had logged out and I had started using the computer, the cooling fan became very noisy, so I checked the activity monitor and saw that a process called EpicWebHelper owned by his account used a lot of CPU, until I killed it. I edited the launchd plist for that process to keep it from starting every time the computer was turned on. I guess it's nice for my son to have his game running when he logs in, but what I don't understand is:\nWhy does a process owned by a specific user remain active when the user logs out?\n\nNotes.\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air, mid-2012, macOS 10.15.7\n\n*My son logs out via the Apple menu.\n\n*All the processes shown in the screenshot are owned by my son's user account.

The processes you list seem to be usual things, don‘t see anything malicious.\nPS: Of course sometimes things just get stuck due to bugs :-)\n\nA: I also would like to know why this happens, but from other posts such as this one, you can at least easily force a logout and termination of all processes. To me, the best is:\nsudo launchctl bootout user/$(id -u <username>)\n\n(Reportedly, only MacOS 10.11 and above).\nThe danger is, of course, that your son might have not logged out, but simply locked the screen or put the computer on sleep.  However, even in Mac 12.6, I'm finding that logging out doesn't really do that.

I can still look up Chinese words using Dictionary.app's interface.\nI'm an amateur in programming. I don't know what I can try to solve this problem.\nAny help appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n\nA: This seems to be a bug with the open command when handling certain characters—for instance, open http://www.google.com?q=中 gives a similar error message. It might be worth reporting this bug to Apple; in the meantime, you can use the following (admittedly less than elegant) workaround:\nosascript -l JavaScript -e \"(a = Application.currentApplication()).includeStandardAdditions=true; a.openLocation('dict://' + encodeURIComponent('中'))\"\n\nThis uses JavaScript for Automation to encode and open the URL, just as open does.

Neither of us could find a way to view the video information on the phone.\nIs there a way to view media information (like file size, dimensions, data taken etc) for photos and movies shot on iPhones?\n\nA: Apple, in their infinite wisdom, has chosen to hide that information. There are few built-in ways to view it in iOS.

Thanks to Steve who started things off. PS - I am never buying an APple product again after wasting so much time on something that should be simple!\nQuestion\nIs it possible to view photo and movie data on iOS?\nAnswer.\nYes.. but it is a series of steps that require many steps. Painful at best.\nBrief description of process\nSince we cant simply look at the media information within the Camera Roll, Iphone users are forced to save the file to the 'Files' App which will allow us to see the media information.\nSteps to take to see Media information on Iphone\n1 - Go to Camera Roll app and select the photo/movie you want to inspect. You can select multiple files by clicking the 'Select' option in the top right corner) after selecting the file(s) click the 'Share' icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen:\n\n2 - A new screen will appear with the selected photo and the option to select more files if we want.

After scrolling up we can see the hidden menu that shows us where to save to the Files App:\n\n3 - Click on the 'Save to Files' option and you will be prompted for which directory to save the file to. Chose a directory to save within the Files app, and then open the app after the file is saved.\n4 - Once the Files app is open, hold your finger on the file you wish to see the info for and a menu will appear:\n\nClick on the 'Info' option to see the following information:\nKind, Size, Date Created, Date Modified, Date last opened, diretory of file on phone, Dimensions and tags.\n\nA: A simple way to see the file size & all other data connected to photos & videos is to use a free app called The Photo Investigator (it’s in the App Store).

Is it possible to set Screen Time App Limits differently on difference devices, when the same iCloud account is used between them?\nI would like to limit how long a child account can spend using a browser on iPhone, but have a more generous limit on a Mac Mini. However, it seems like App Limits are shared across devices - aforementioned child left the Mac logged in, which has used up all her App Limit allowance for the day.\n\nA: Yes, but it's a trade-off. The answer is to turn off \"Sync across devices\" in Screentime settings. That way, all your App Limits can be different on different devices.\nThe downside is that it also stops syncing all the other Screentime settings, so you'll have to individually maintain the Always Allowed list, the Downtime hours, etc. Any changes that you make later will need to be made separately on each device.\nIt can be a bit of a pain, but it's probably worth it to get the flexibility you're asking about.\n", "Q: Can't click on MacOS Utilities I'm in recovery-mode ...

I have also re-downloaded the file, but by checking with diff it seems identical to the first I downloaded.\nThe hdiutil verify method proposed here generates a \"valid\" output.\nIs there anything else I could try?\nThanks.\n\nA: This is not so much a definitive answer as some speculation based on prior known behaviour.\nOne thing to note is that the 'date/certificate issue' should now be fixed for all older installers & so shouldn't need any workaround in that respect.\nI haven't tried any of these older installers in a while, but in the past some were only valid if your computer could not run any newer OS. The El Capitan installer was specifically 'sold' that way.\nThe Apple site you linked  also obliquely points in the same direction. Each of those links says \"can upgrade…\"  (I don't have any recent hard evidence to know if this is true or not).\nSee How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS? for some history behind this, though the answer is probably falling behind the times now. I can't maintain it any more as I have no Mac capable of running anything newer than Mojave.\nOn a Mac Pro I'd test this by removing the drive with Catalina on it & installing from USB to a fresh clean drive. Not sure that's so easy on a laptop.\nOne thing I would definitely try… You appear to be creating the installer on the same partition you want to install to (if I'm reading you correctly). I'm pretty sure this isn't going to work. Create the installer on a separate USB stick & boot to that, then attempt install to the internal partition.\nAlternatively, you could try installing from Internet Recovery. If you boot holding  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   Shift ⇧   R  the installer presented should be the one that originally shipped with your Mac. If that's successful, then the earlier potential caveat of 'can update from' would then be on your side.\nOne other thing to note is that as these installers are all designed \"to update\" then I'd be pretty sure they will run as an app if mounted to a Mac already running any OS older than the installer. It wouldn't need to be made into a USB boot drive. That would make your upgrade from your original OS over Internet Recovery much simpler… maybe ;)\nFrom comments\nApparently the new installer dmg files install the \"Install macOS (name)\" into your apps folder, from where you can run the update.\n", "Q: Missing 0 key when change input source from ABC to Hungarian I recently got a new MacBook Pro for work/personal usage, the physical keyboard itself has a default US English qwerty layout. In keyboard settings I added ABC and Hungarian. It works perfectly, except for one little thing when I change to Hungarian input there is no way to write 0.\nIs there a key combination, or way to configure it? It's very frustrating whenever I write something in Hungarian and have to change the input source back to ABC just to write 0.\n\nA: Hungary (and the rest of Europe) uses the ISO keyboard, which has one extra key compared to the US Qwerty keyboard.  As a result, some characters may go missing or be misplaced when you try to use European layouts with the US keyboard.\nHungarian Qwerty has the zero at Option `.  Hungarian (which is qwertz) seems to have it at Control Option Zero. (Mac's don't normally use Control for characters like this, so it may not work in all apps.)\nYou can also create a custom layout, or set up a text shortcut in system preferences > keyboard > text > replace with.\nABC Extended has zero in the normal place and can make all the Hungarian special characters via option dead keys.\nhttps://sites.psu.edu/symbolcodes/mac/codemacext/\n", "Q: MacBook main volume can't be mounted during boot MacBook 7.1 (white unibody) from 2010, I have upgraded to a new SSD some years ago.

It says that it couldn't be unmounted because it is in use by process 712 (kextcache). Tried unmounting and it won't let me either. What should I do? Right now i can't even book an appointment at the Genius Bar because of Covid.\n\nA: Try erasing the entire drive, not just the volumes.\nIn Disk Utility, Hit  Cmd ⌘   2   (or see the View menu) to show Devices instead of just Volumes.  Select the overall drive you will now see over the volumes (now in a disclosure triangle instead of separate) and Erase that, GUID/APFS.\nIf you aren’t following an internet recovery factory erase, here is the best one:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nClick through to the erase portion.\nSelecting the correct item in Disk Utility almost always gets an erase completed without reverting to the terminal app and command-line tools.

I usually use EveryMac.com.\nAnd under Second display support on the second link above it says:\n\n*This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt.

Although it can theoretically power all\nthree external displays, as confirmed by a helpful reader, it runs too\nhot with three displays connected.\n\nTo me that says your Mac does not support the highest resolution of that monitor, so you are going to get a resolution that is lower and of poorer quality.\nYou need to get a monitor that supports 2560 x 1600 native resolution for optimal display output.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt and USB logo on screen I was trying to refresh my MacBook Air because I had just purchased a veikk A15 pen tablet and was trying to connect it to my MacBook Air. The instructions told me to refresh my MacBook Air and so I did. But then a USB and thunderbolt logo appears on my screen and won’t load my computer. This MacBook Air as no thunderbolt or USB port.\n\nWhat has happened to my Mac?\n\nA: These symbols are displayed when a Mac boots into target disk mode. Usually you activate it by pressing T at startup (different startup key combinations). Another option is to go into settings → startup disk → target disk mode.\nYou can simply restart your machine and it should boot normal. If it does not, disconnect all peripherals (mice, keyboards,...) and try again.\nTarget disk mode makes your internal hard-drive accessible to connected Macs via Thunderbolt/FireWire. Read more about target disk mode here or here.\n\nIf this still boots into target disk mode, then your T is broken and continuously sending a pressed state to your MBA (MacBookAir) which can only be solved by repair.\n\nNote: I assume by refresh you mean reboot.\n", "Q: is there a better alternative to clean installs? Effort to reinstall OS on M1 fails when following Apple's published steps; even two Apple Sr. Advisors were stumped by the issue. One felt the computer needed to be returned and the problem could not be solved.\nThe following discussion came up in the context of trying to solve this issue.\nWhy do a clean install? @benwiggy argues pretty persuasively that you shouldn't\n\nThe separation of the OS on a read-only partition, with third-party installs and user-specific content all in different places means that there's very little point and usually an easier way to fix any problems. [...] Brand new hardware sometimes has special builds, that are a different fork from the available download.\n\nMy take on why\n\nClean install has been a great way in the past to remove all customizations and private information. It enables anyone to start from a known starting point shared by an entire community of users. I certainly think of it as 'best practice' when handing off computers between team members, and as a result I'm in the same boat.\n\nLogical follow-on question: is there a better way of returning to \"known starting point shared by an entire community of users\", and/or of reaching a reasonable certainty that all private information is removed?\n\nA: Certainly, if you are selling or passing on a Mac to someone else, then you should wipe the disk and install the OS anew, ideally leaving it so that it boots to the \"Welcome\" setup assistant. This will remove all personal data. (Trying to recover deleted data on SSDs is much harder than on hard drives.)\nCautious purchasers / recipients may wish to ensure that the computer is 'safe' by wiping the disk and installing the OS themselves.\nBut for the purposes of trouble-shooting an existing installation, or as part of 'routine maintenance', a clean install is largely 'overkill'. This is particularly true if you intend to restore most of your previous software and settings to the disk, leaving out only some elements that may be causing problems. It's analogous to destroying your whole house and rebuilding it just because you need to replace the toilet.\n", "Q: What is the difference in the way PageUp/Pagedown keys are handled by Terminal.app vs iTerm2.app?

Can the iTerm2 behavior be replicated  in the Terminal.app ?\n\nA: After messing around with different key combinations it seems that Shift-[PageUp/PageDn] in Terminal.app has the same effect in ipython as simply [PageUp/PageDn] in iTerm2.

This is the same as using the defaults write command you list.\nAs of a recent version of macOS, this does not show .DS_Store, and there is no way to show .DS_Store files in Finder. There are likely other files that have the same exceptions applied to them. To view these files, use the terminal:\nls -a\nFiles that do not appear with ls -a either don't exist or cannot be viewed regardless of configuration.\n\nA: Well, I don't know about showing files starting with \".\" in the finder, but you can just as easily do what you want in the terminal. Just open the terminal go to the directory you want ( you start from your home directory you can use the \"cd\" command followed by the directory name like this: cd desktop or cd download. Once you are in the desired directory you can type ls -la to see a list of all the files and folders included the hidden ones that start with a \".\" You can open the files using the open command followed by the file name.

I come from the windows world and I am not sure where to go from here. If I make a boot image on a jump drive I would have to use a windows machine.\n\nA: It sounds like you also deleted the recovery partition.

I can't view .DS_Store, .localized, ._.* and ._* with Finder: Show ALL files starting with a dot in Finder\nuser3439894 commented there that it's impossible to do so with Finder:\n\nSome dot files, e.g. .DS_Store, you can see in Terminal using e.g. ls -a however the ones you used to see in Finder and cannot now see them is because Finder is programmed to not show those files files even with it's set to show hidden files. The ._* and ._.* are extended attributes/resource fork files and normally cannot be seen in Terminal or Finder when properly associated/linked to their normal files or if created on a filesystem which does support them and either viewed from Finder or brought back to an HFS+/APFS filesystem.\n\nAnd an answer on SO Unable to show .DS_Store file on Mojave also says it's impossible with Finder.\nSo my question is, how can I send my handwritten file ._. to people on Discord?\nI can't drag-and-drop the file to Discord, because I can't see it in Finder in the first place, and also the upload dialogue uses macOS' Finder file browser as most apps do so I also can't select the file manually after clicking the \"Browse...\" button.\n\nA: Looking at your question, I can tell you that it is possible for you to create a file name \"._.\" and then share it however, discord will automatically change the filename when you upload. This is how you do it tough. First, open the terminal then type the command touch ._. then type open ._. this will open the file in the text editor. Once you have the file opened type whatever you want in there, once you are done, open discord, and then drag the blank file icon from your text editor into discord.

I upgraded my Mac air from Mojave to Big sur, but after the upgrade when I start the computer it will ask me to log in with the old Mojave login screen then it will proceed again to big sur login screen. There are two log in screens now in my laptop and I want to remove the old Mojave login.\n\nA: Seems like somehow you're stuck at Mojave's Preboot environment.\nWith FileVault 2 on, the Preboot environment (the Mojave one that you see), instead of full-fat macOS, is booted first to ask you for your FileVault 2 password in order to decrypt your data and then, proceed to normal macOS startup procedure (when you see the Big Sur startup interface).\nThe strange thing is that the preboot environment itself should be upgraded along with your recent Big Sur installation, but wasn't. If you're using MacBook Air 2018 or later, T2's magic may be to blame.\nThe solution is: manually updating your preboot environment. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*Enter macOS Recovery, and\n\n*\n\n*Install Big Sur again\n\n*OR, if that still didn't work, turn off FileVault 2 and:\n\n\n*\n\n*In macOS Utilities, open Terminal.\n\n*Run sudo diskutil list to get Preboot's identifier (usually disk1s3).\n\n*Run sudo diskutil apfs deleteVolume IDENTIFIER.\n\n*Install Big Sur again like in method 1.\n\n\n\nEither way, your data should be unaffected.

When I go to the systemprefs trough the applicationsfolder, I've got the 'new' systemprefs witch works as it should... The question now is, how can I override the 'old' systemprefs with the 'new' in the top-menu.\n\nA: Yes. I like to make a new user account and the log out of all the old users. No data is lost, but you can time the new user to open preferences.\nThen you know if the problem is the system needs to be fixed / reinstalled or just your user has corrupt preferences.\nAssuming it’s not your user account, this might be faster to sort by a Time Machine backup and erasing the mac to reinstall a clean OS. Once you’re sure it’s not a bug in a clean OS, you can run Migration Assistant and bring back your apps / documents and not your settings in the hopes that it cures the issue.\nSorry I don’t have a more surgical method to isolate this reliably. It’s hitting what might be an isolated issue with a big hammer, but you probably need a backup anyhow since the system is degrading and you’ll likely spend more time troubleshooting this than testing a clean install.\n", "Q: How to add person to a photo in Photos app I'd like to (manually?) add people \"tags\" to photos in the Photos app that were not recognized automatically.

I could install the printers using macOS v10.15 (Catalina) (or older) drivers, and my scanners would work, but not the printers! AirPrint would not work either.\nI scoured the web for many hours and tried 1) Resetting the printer system - no go.  2) Reinstalling CUPS (with SIP disabled and Gatekeeper disabled - no go because of Apple's read-only /usr filesystem ... not getting into setting up remounting the root (/) filesystem because of FileVault problems.\nI noticed that this was a problem that everyone was having regardless of their printer brand - indicating that it was a system problem.\n\nA: What worked: I read the error logs on my printers. They pointed me to permission problems with /usr/libexec/cups.

Printing with older drivers works now! AirPrint works. The scanners work. Apparently Apple screwed up the perms on the cups directory that makes printing work when they created their protected filesystem! Urrgghh! This should work with all older printers regardless of brand.\nYMMV.\n\nA: Brother DCP-7065DN and MFC-7860DW printers also have connectivity problems with each Big Sur upgrade.\nTypically, after the Macs are shut down and restarted each day, we find no connectivity to our printers.\nOur two solutions have been to delete and re-install each printer each morning or, just don't ever turn off the Macs.

Nevertheless, its resolution is not clear and seems to be a matter of chance.\nFor clarity let me add the following background info:\nFor a couple of months I've been successfully running my 2013 iMac from an external SSD (for speed reasons). Initially, the SSD was a clone of my internal High Sierra Macintosh HD. Since then, program updates and content were added successfully to the SSD.\nToday I performed a successful upgrade to Catalina. The system looked fine.\nI then performed another recommended security + Safari update. When completed the Mac booted to the old High Sierra OS from the internal HDD!\nI used the Startup preferences to set the external 10.15 OS X SSD as boot disk - no effect! still booting from HDD.\nI tried rebooting into Recovery mode (cmd+R+power) to get access to the disk utility - no effect! the boot process form HDD continued regardless of that. This key combination worked fine when I cloned my HDD.\nThe same happened when I tried NVRAM reset (opt+cmd+R+P) - the boot process form HDD continued regardless of that.\nI disconnected the SSD and tried again Recovery mode and NVRAM reset. This time the key combination commands seem to work, but even though I selected to boot from the SSD, which I reconnected, iMac simply booted from the internal HDD.\nI made the above attempts following advices provided in various forums where success was reported on sporadic cases.\nIs there any structured procedure (or another wild idea), to set it right? i.e. make iMac boot from the external Catalina SSD\nComments:\n\n*\n\n*The external SSD is now displayed in Finder as two disks: Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - data. This was probably created during the upgrade to Catalina. No idea why. (The internal HDD was never partitioned throughout all previous OS X upgrades).\n\n\n*If worse comes to worst, I have a Time Machine backup of the SSD prior to the Catalina upgrade. Not sure how to use it under the circumstances.\nThanx\n\nA: UPDATE\nI found that I can boot from my external SSD reliably as long as my external HDD for Time Machine is not connected. No need for the extensive process below - just power down, unplug external HDD, and my Mac can boot from the external SSD.\n---ORIGINAL POST BELOW---\nI had the same issue and neither the SMC reset mentioned here or the NVRAM reset discussed here worked.\nBut the workaround I found to reliably boot off the SSD is:\n\n*\n\n*Power off the computer\n\n*Disconnect the external SSD\n\n*Power on the computer (which will boot off the internal hard drive's OS)\n\n*Connect the external SSD\n\n*Login and shut down\n\n*Power on while holding the option key\n\n*Select the external ssd from the menu and the computer will boot off the SSD\n\n\nA: Good news, after half an hour on phone with Apple's support, it works. For now.\nThe solution was SMC reset, which is: unplug all accessories, unplug from AC power for 15 sec., plug in again, wait 10 sec., and power up iMac.\nI was astonished by this simple solution!\nFew reservations though:\n\n*\n\n*Maybe the other steps I performed (such as NVRAM reset) also played an important role.\n\n\n*Surprisingly, now that its back on, Catalina recommends to perform 2020-01 security update. I'm sure I did that before, and if I'm not wrong, the 'disaster' happened immediately afterwards. I'm avoiding it for the meantime. Apple Support said there is no known problem with it and I could try that in future.\n\n\n*The SSD upgrade to Catalina seems to have affected the iMac operation when it booted to High Sierra from The HDD. I'm not sure how it will perform should I need to boot again from HDD. Maybe the SMC reset corrected that as well. Who knows...\n\n\n*I'm still concerned if my iMac will continue to properly work from SSD for a prolonged period.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Assist Disappeared after Windows Update My windows crashed and I had to reset by re-installing windows.  After it was complete, I lost the ability to access Bootcamp so that I can switch back into the Mac.  I am stuck in Windows!   Anyone know how to help get Bootcamp back so that I can access the Mac?  Everything I find is to re-install BC assistant, but I cannot get into the Mac to do that.\n\nA: Separate to the Boot Camp Control Panel, you can always choose your startup disk by holding alt/option on boot.\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown, then hold option/alt and click the power button once, continuing to hold option until the Startup Manager appears.\n\n*Choose your macOS startup disk to start from macOS this time.\n\n*Download the support software from Boot Camp Assistant and copy it to an external disk or other shared location between Windows and macOS.\n\n*Restart your Mac, which will boot into Windows again.\n\n*Reinstall the Boot Camp support software you downloaded and copied in step 3.\n\nIf you want to use Startup Manager in the future, something perhaps useful to know is you can change the default disk from the Startup Manager by holding control while choosing your startup disk.\n", "Q: Use 2019 Macbook Pro trackpad with 8th generation iPad I've seen software to link a MBP's keyboard to other devices, but is this possible for MBP's trackpad? I want to be able to use my MBP trackpad with my iPad. Even if I have to develop the software myself, where would I start?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to relay the MBP's trackpad inputs to other devices in general.\nUsing the MBP trackpad with any iPad and in general is unfortunately not possible.\nIf you want to develop the software yourself, you would be looking at creating two applications:\nFirst a small application on the Mac that captures the trackpad input similar to how VMware and Parallels Desktop captures trackpad input. It needs to forward it to the iPad using for example a network protocol.\nThe second application is an iPad app that speaks the same protocol and thus is able to take in the input from the trackpad. You would then react to that input in your application like you react to touches from the user.\nYou can use this open-source project to inject the trackpad input into your app:\nhttps://github.com/Ret70/PTFakeTouch\nHowever take note that this will only work with your own app. You cannot use the trackpad input to control other third party apps (unless you have convinced them to use your protocol), or to control Apple's default apps.\nIf you're willing to jailbreak your iPad, you can control other third party apps and Apple's default apps by injecting your trackpad inputs into the system.\nYou could even use this open-source project instead of building your own iPad app to inject the inputs:\nhttps://github.com/xuan32546/IOS13-SimulateTouch\nIt features a simple network protocol that you can send trackpad inputs to and have it injected as touch events on the iPad.\n", "Q: Saving space by thinning universal intel/arm binaries I have no ARM CPUs on any of my laptops or desktops.  If ever I get a computer new enough, it will already have all the binaries it needs or will get them from updates.  So there is no justification for them to consume 90 GB¹ on my internal drive.\nI can reclaim that space by disabling SIP, using ditto to thin them while copying to somewhere else, copying them back where they belong, and re-enabling SIP.  Pretty clumsy to have to do after every software update.  Is there a better way?\n¹assuming an ARM binary is about the same size as an Intel.\n\nA: That's just how other tools do it, like CleanMyMac does with Universal apps (not sure if it's been updated for Universal 2 yet). There doesn't appear to be a better solution than manually removing the other architecture from each app, which can be done with some tools (see Is there any free solution to remove unneeded architectures from Universal binaries?) and these can be made to loop over a given folder of applications.\nThere are more steps required than just disabling SIP to do this with Big Sur's own applications now that Big Sur boots from a sealed APFS snapshot. Can I mount the root (system) filesystem as writable in Big Sur? goes into the steps required to make a modification to the bootable snapshot, but the modification you make to remove the other architecture is the same.\n", "Q: How do I Employ CJK's AppleScript \"makeASDate\" Handler Without Error?

While setting it up, I noticed a feature I had not seen before. Whenever the cursor got close to one of the four corners of the screen, a quarter-circle-like shape appeared adjusted to the specific corner and the edge of the quarter circle was gradually being filled up with color.\nIn the meantime, I have changed a lot of settings in Big Sur and I can no longer reproduce this phenomenon. As a result, I cannot post a screenshot/video and must rely on the verbal description above. If this description sounds familiar to anyone, I would be grateful for the identification of this feature. The closest match I could find is hot corners, but this quarter-circle thing definitely seems to be a distinct feature.\n\nA: I figured it out. When you select Show Keyboard Viewer within the keyboard input menu in the menu bar, it automatically enables Accessibility Keyboard, in the same way as though you had checked Enable Accessibility Keyboard in System Preferences > Accessibility > Keyboard > Accessibility Keyboard.\nNow, this feature has its own hot-corner functionality (the default setting is Hide / Show Home Panel in all four corners), but it only gets activated if the cursor keeps touching (or “dwelling on”) one of the corners for 1–2 seconds. After this delay, the keyboard viewer is hidden or shown once again. It is during this short delay that the quarter circle appears and its white edge gets gradually filled up with gray—see the picture below.\n\n", "Q: Is it normal for a new Mac to have less than 100% battery health? I bought a new Mac, a little over a month ago. It has exactly 15 battery cycles now (after my use, of course). So, definitely, a new battery.\nBut, my problem is that I can see, through CoconutBattery and iStats that it can only retain about 8100mAh. They state my battery is with a health of 92~93% (supposedly, this battery is rated around 8700mAh when new). I confirmed on Apple stats that it retains 8100mAh, but Apple tells me nothing about the total expected capacity.\nIs there a problem with my battery, or is this just a normal manufacturing variation?\nThey all state the condition is normal. But I find it weird that it won't retain 100% or even close to that, like 97, 98, 99%.\nI can only imagine in a year, this dropping to below 90, like around 80%. I had other Macs that retained that over the period of like 3 years or more.\n\nA: This happens regularly and we don’t have issues with them at work and often see a pretty wide range of FCC numbers initially. The measurements are precise but not accurate over short time periods. I would track use every three months and if at the 11 month period get a second read by Apple. They will have service notes for the battery diagnostic when new and also at almost a year so that will tell very accurately what the overall lifespan is.\nIf you haven’t contacted AppleCare and had them run one remote battery diagnostic, do that late January after the rush of holiday help requests has died down. Unless it’s popping a warning or you can’t get reasonable life, there’s no rush to get the first scan done.\nHere are some past posts on whether any one measurement is predictive and how to handle end of warranty situations.\nI would use that battery hard for a week or two (empty to full) and you’ll know it’s performing or not without needing any special calibration steps that were used in the past.\n\nA: From what I remember reading, it's usual for there to be some small reduction from 'design' capacity in the first couple of months, and then it should be steady. If you are losing any more than c 93% over the first six months, then I would take it in to be looked at.\n\nA: No, It is not normal for a new MacBook to have less than 100% battery. U should contact support and get your product replaced.\ncheck this from apple support\n", "Q: Occasionally getting additional spaces inserted when typing When typing, after hitting spacebar, I often get an additional space inserted. I haven't seen it happen when using the built-in keyboard, but it happens with two separate external keyboards. As far as suspect software goes, I do have Karabiner installed, though I see the issue even when it isn't running and if it were the issue, I would expect to see it happen when using the built-in keyboard as well.\nI've tried two separate brands of USB-A to USB-C dongles for connecting the keyboards, but the issue still happens with both.\nI also haven't seen the issue with any other key, only the spacebar. I'm not sure how to go about tracking down a root cause here.\n\nA: Just found out that this was due to a bad switch, at least on the second keyboard. Both keyboards I was having issues with are mechanical, but it seemed pretty unlikely that they'd both have an issue for the exact same key. I swapped the switch used for the spacebar with another and it's working much better now :)\n", "Q: Is it possible to \"emulate\" virtual monitors like Windows does for remote desktop users? I want to remote desktop into macOS, but when I use a client like VNC Viewer on my Windows PC, it only allows me to go up to whatever resolution the macOS machine has (like 2560x1440 on an iMac).\nMy Windows setup has 3 monitors attached (4K, 2.5K, and 2K). If I use native Windows remote desktop into a tiny laptop with a 1920x1080 monitor, the program still opens up in fullscreen. It basically emulates having 3 monitors connected to the laptop.\nI want the same but for macOS. What options do I have in that regard? Bonus points if it can run headless, so I can use it on a Mac Mini or a Mac Pro stashed away in a closet somewhere.\n\nA: Not using macOS Screen Sharing alone. It isn't really comparable to Windows Remote Desktop in terms of how it works.\nWindows RD provides a service to the client, leaving it up to the client to handle the UI rendering.\nmacOS Screen Sharing / VNC relays screen contents to the client and returns user inputs to the server.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Partition Erased and Partition is Gone (Now it's FREE SPACE) I removed my Bootcamp Partition and now I suddenly lost about 75GB of space on my Macintosh HD drive.

When I looked at Activity Monitor, my CPU was 97.44% idle.\nIs this a problem with the computer or is this normal?\n\nA: When using something like video conferencing software, the likelihood is that your GPU was called on to be more active, rather than the CPU.\nI'm not actually certain whether the 2D rendering needed for a video call would swap to the discrete GPU on a dual-GPU machine or whether it would remain on the onboard Intel.\nIn either case, lifting the computing requirements of either card would produce additional heat, causing the fans to ramp slightly. That your CPU temperature only went to 57℃ would tell me it was doing its job just fine.\nI don't know of any simple way to see GPU activity on a Mac, other than to use something like iStat Menus, which can display this in a menu bar drop down…\n\nThis shows my card is almost asleep, it has so little work to do right now with just a few web pages open ;)\nHowever, I would see no cause for concern if your fans ramp during a video call, so long as that CPU temperature shows it's keeping pace very well. CPU temperatures are OK to about 100℃ so I wouldn't worry unless you see such temperatures whilst only on a call & not doing something very intensive like compiling source code for an application, or running video compression/transcoding, which will light the entire machine up.\n\nA: \nCPU Temperature was at 57deg Celcius\n\nThis is well within normal temperature range.\nYou can try resetting your nvram one time (which is unlikely to help) and SMC one time (slightly more likely to help, but not if it’s just a busy CPU/GPU)  if you think your fans are not spinning up out of error.

How do I go back to the original configuration\n.\n\nA: To restore an iPad to factory settings, connect it to a computer running macOS 10.15 or later, or to a PC/Mac running iTunes. It will show up in Finder (or iTunes) from where you can initiate the restore.\nApple has it documented in detail in Restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to factory settings.\nIf all you want is to run the setup assistant, open the settings app and in general, there is a reset all settings option.\n\nChoose “Erase all content and settings”\n", "Q: Signing into a different Apple ID for Media and Purchases I'm signed in to two Apple IDs on my iPhone.

I know the purchases cannot be transferred to a different ID, but that's not a problem for me.\n\nA: You will not lose the apps already installed on your device. These apps will stay installed and registered to the previous ID. You may need to enter the Apple ID used to first install the app after a while when you come to update them and automatic updates will stop working for these apps.

(OSStatus error -9806.)\nRecently, I did do a little bit of file deletions by name (a measure to manually uninstall an app after using the app's own uninstallation tool, since it did an incomplete job) across all user libraries. Parental Controls are also active (which I can bypass, but prefer not to disable altogether), and webfilterproxyd has been using obscene amounts of RAM ever since (up to 3.5GB; averages at 1.3GB).\nOther issues that subsequently arose include internet response in web browsers other than Safari is extremely slowed, and certain functions do not respond, namely…\n• Opera (and its 'VPN' proxy service; it does not offer multiple proxy options anymore; download speeds are between bytes and kilobytes for the first 5 minutes or so, previously ranging between 500KBps and 5MBps.)\n• Opera GX (default browser with same errors as Opera, except that when I open a link from Apple's Mail application, it does not load the webpage but rather merely launches the application. Beforehand, it would default to opening in whichever application window was closest to the top (in the application switcher), no matter the browser or privacy mode. Now, it forcefully launches Opera GX and doesn't even process the link that prompted it to launch.)\n• Discord (desktop app; usually had instantaneous response, now takes two minutes to launch and 30 seconds to load pages, even if I had just visited them less than a minute earlier.)\n• Dictionary (Wikipedia search, specifically. This is where I got the error message. After the error message displays, it takes 30 seconds to load any page– it used to be instantaneous.)\n• Mail (Apple's email application; runs normally, except that if there is web content on an email, it takes an extra 10 seconds to load.)\nMeanwhile, Safari is running faster than ever.\nWhen dragging a Finder window's icon to a file-upload browser, it drags the window instead (unless I click and hold for 3 seconds on the icon only, before dragging).\nLastly, I'm constantly prompted to re-authenticate my Google account. I select 'continue.' It opens System Preferences and prompts me to open in Safari to authenticate. I select 'Open in Safari' and then wait a minute. Safari never opens, and even if it's already open it doesn't launch the login prompt. Instead, I get this:\n\nI reset my PRAM 5 times this morning. So far, I can't tell the difference.\nWhat can be done to restore the former connectivity to these apps?\nI'm an intermediate-advanced user, so I can follow advanced steps.\n\nA: In the event that you threw out something you shouldn't have, first thing to do would be to boot into Recovery and overlay the OS.\nThe reinstall from Recovery (as opposed to a full wipe & install from Internet Recovery) will ensure all essential OS components are in place without changing any user data.\nbtw, resetting the NVRAM will do nothing at all for this type of issue.\nA quick Google tells me OSStatus error -9806 is errSSLClosedAbort which sounds like an internet security component is not working properly.\n", "Q: Move from Intel to M1 with TimeMachine I'm thinking about switching to new Mac with ARM in next months. I usually backup with TimeMachine my Mac. 3 years ago I moved from MacBook Air to MacBook Pro really smoothly using backup from TimeMachine. I'm now  asking if it will be as easy as last time doing it from an x86 Mac to a ARM one. For example all binaries files in my mac will not work on the new one, are they copied anyway? I know that Rosetta exists and it can run x86 binaries, but I definitely prefer pure ARM install of software instead of have the Mac full of old binaries. Does Time Machine copy smartly the applications or I need to do it manually? Is there a way to copy only the data and not the executable files?\nSuppose that I have to transfer all the x86 executable files. Is there a script to clean the Mac from unnecessary files? This should be in another question, but since is quite related to what I'm talking about: how can I clean my Mac from old and uninstalled application data? My Library folder is full of files created by applications that I have uninstalled years ago (some of them were  uninstalled on the old mac and Time Machine brought their data on the new Mac) and I want to clean up it; I guess that this problem affects also other folders.\nThank you!\n\nA: Having just done this myself, I can confirm that migrating from a Time Machine backup works very well from an Intel Mac to an M1.\nAs far as I can tell, everything gets copied over, so this includes your entire user account, system preferences, Unix files in /usr/local, and applications.\nA few apps were reported to be 'damaged': sometimes this could be fixed by deleting the quarantine attribute; otherwise the files did need to be re-downloaded. Some (but not all) complex apps with installers needed to be reinstalled.\nInterestingly, even a software licence key that's supposed to be linked to the hardware, came across with all my licences on it!\nAs for removing old Application Support folders for no-longer-used apps: that's easy enough to do yourself. You can check for plists in the Preferences folder, if every Kb matters.\nI wouldn't recommend using 'cleaning' apps, as they can delete the wrong stuff and leave stuff that ought to be deleted, just as easily as you can.\n\nA: Homebrew files get copied and continue to run the x86 executables using Rosetta. I wasn't aware of this until I ran into a problem while trying to link an x86 library installed with the old brew with some new code.\nI guess the best is to upgrade and ran without having to rely on Rosetta.\nHere's what happens to the Homebrew files in more detail and how to upgrade to the new M1 arm64 version: https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/417\n", "Q: Why does my Logitech C920 camera turn off and on again during recording with Photo Booth? I have a Logitech C920 external webcam connected to my MacBook Air (13 inch, 2020) via a USB Type-C Hub.\nI've been using it successfully to record videos using Photobooth until couple of days ago I upgraded the operating system to BigSur 11.1. Thereafter I started to experience following problem: In the middle of a recording, the blue indicator light on the webcam turns off and on again, and in the resulting video there are a couple of black frames.\nI thought that maybe some device attached to the USB hub is getting too much power, so I removed all the devices (the mouse and the mobile router) from that hub so that the camera was the only one connected to the hub. This did not solve the problem.\nI then downloaded and installed the Logitech settings app and currently I have following settings:\n\nYesterday I turned off Auto focus and it seemed that it helped. However, today I again had those flashes.\nI record videos that are between 6 and 15 minutes long. The problem gets worse towards the end of a video.\nWhat can be the cause of this problem and how can I fix it?\nUpdate 1: Here is a video where between 00:04 and 00:05 you can see how the blue indicator light of the camera turns off and on again.\nUpdate 2: Today I tried to record a 10-minute video using the built-in camera and I had the same effect as with the external one.\n\nA: I'd first connect the camera directly, not via any hub. I have the same C920 & it can be sensitive to that. (Hmm, of course that may not be possible on USB-C… which would make eliminating the hub itself as a cause much tougher.)\nSecondly, I would watch Activity Monitor whilst the recording is running, see if you can spot any jump in activity even on an unrelated process.\nThirdly, ensure as much as possible that any other user-controlled process isn't going to need resources at the same time. Video recording is resource-intensive, so try not to share the task with anything else that may be greedy.\nLastly, check you have lots of disk space so that you're not choking the process at write. As the issue increases with recording duration, this may be high on the list. Potentially video write & virtual memory may start to compete for the same space.\n", "Q: Why is a Time Machine backup so slow over a fast network? Despite having a gigabit hardwired ethernet connection to my Macbook Air, when I have Time Machine backing up to an iMac also hardwired on the same switch in the same network, the transfer speed is often less then 1MB per second.\nIf/when I copy a file from the Air (Catalina 10.15.7) to my iMac (Mojave 10.14.6), I get a speed of about 65MB per second.  As it is, it takes about a month to get the 1Tb disk in my Air backed up, all that time sitting there with a wired connection and doing little else. If I could get 65MB/sec with Time Machine, it would take less than 5 hours to backup that 1Tb disk.\nThe backup disk is a 5Tb portable USB drive connected to the server (my iMac running Mojave) and configured to \"share as a Time Machine backup destination\".  Several Macs (High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina) are successfully (but slowly) backing up to it over WiFi.\nHow can I get the initial backup to go as fast as possible?\n\nA: Time Machine is really poor at working over a network, and I’ve stopped doing this. The best way to run Time Machine now (macOS 11) is to give it a dedicated encrypted disk (which TM will reformat to APFS). The backups will be very fast and you will be hard pressed to notice them, but even backing up to an HFS+ local drive will be orders of magnitude faster than over your LAN.\n(The reasons for this are somewhat opaque, but the backup process is very different when backing up over a network as your target is not a disk or even a network folder, but a sparse image file on the network and this makes, as you’ve seen, a huge difference. The behavior seems to have gotten worse in recent versions to the point where it’s just not worth it.)\nAnother option you might consider is to use a syncing tool to sync your data to a location on the target machine that is part of its regular backup. I’d do both, but then I’m a \"three backups are the minimal starter set” sort of guy.\n\nA: If all else fails, try this command:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\n\nThis command essentially allows the Time Machine to use all resources available, which should theoretically speed up the backup. Make sure to revert to the default afterwards, or else subsequent background system operations may take too much resources and make your laptop very slow.\nAlternatively, you may want to try another sharing protocol. If you have been using SMB, try AFP or NFS. Additionally, you can try sshfs: if you choose the fastest encryption algorithm, IIRC it should be faster than all other three protocols.\nAs other answers stated, Time Machine over a network is really slow. The best option is to use a hard drive directly attached to the MacBook Air.\nIf you still insist on backing up over a network, you can try iSCSI. However, this is not provided nor supported by Apple. There should be commercial software that allows you to set up a iSCSI server on your iMac and access the target on your MacBook Air. This allows you to access the block device on your iMac over the network, and you can treat it like an external disk directly attached to your MacBook.\n\nA: Virus scanning software can make Time Machine backups very slow. If you use Norton AntiVirus or a similar product, try to exclude your backup disk from automatic scanning. Also make sure you are running the latest version of the virus scanning software.\n\nA: The first time you use Time Machine, set it up in the evening so that the initial backup can be done overnight.\n\nA: If your backup disk is a Time Capsule, leave your Mac in the same room as the Time Capsule for the initial backup, or use an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac to one of the Ethernet ports on the Time Capsule.\n", "Q: How do I unhide the desktop folder in my home folder? I've tried How to unhide files on Mac?, and chflags nohidden not unhiding hidden files to no avail. I want to unhide ~/desktop while I have iCloud desktop turned on.\n\nA: While you can unhide folders, you cannot unhide the Desktop or Documents folder when using Desktop iCloud. Both it and the Documents folder are hidden by having the com.apple.iCloud.desktop extended attribute applied, remove that attribute and you are no longer using iCloud Desktop/Documents folders.\nYou could do something like ln -s \"$HOME/Desktop\" \"$HOME/Desktop \" (note the space) if you want to see a folder in your home folder.\n\nA: Press ⇧ Shift + ⌘ Command + . . This key combination will display any hidden folders in your Mac's hard drive. Any hidden folders or files will appear as grayed-out.

You can install it with Homebrew with brew install imagemagick. You would include it through the do shell script command, for example do shell script 'convert input.png -quality 85% output.jpg'.\n\nA: There is no such thing as the \"original\" quality when you're dealing with JPEG's.\nThis answer on Photo.SE explains that when you open a JPEG, it's decoded and decompressed. When you apply changes, the application does this on the decompressed version in memory. Then, when you hit export, the application compresses the image again taking the JPEG quality into account.\nThis other answer on Photo.SE has more information on JPEG-to-JPEG exports.\nYou don't indicate explicitly why you want the \"original\" quality, but I think you are looking to approach the same file size as the original JPEG.\nIn that case, try out the different quality levels (low, medium, ...) to check which level gives you approximately the same file size as the JPEG file you started with.\nThen use UI scripting to export the photos at the desired quality level.\n\nA: Utilize the HEIC format by exporting originals. Multiple operating systems support this including windows via a plugin.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7644152\n\nA: The Photos library contains AAE files but they are proprietary and can't be exported.\nQuicktime will use an AAE file (if you place it next to the original mov) for slow motion videos to mark where the positions (but again it can't be exported).\nI found that you can filter the photos by 'edited' (though it is not always accurate and sometimes shows unmodified photos as edited)\n\n*\n\n*so I exported the modified photos as JPG (with modifications)\n\n*and all unmodified media in their original quality (HEIC/mov)\n\n", "Q: Is there any USB Network Adapter available for Mac that works with Big Sur?

I am using Macos 10.15.7, and Garageband 10.3.5.  I have a MIDI keyboard plugged in via a USB cable.  I configured the MIDI device using \"Audio Midi Studio.app\".   I added my keyboard, and tested it using Midi Studio -> Test Setup.

It's just that Garage Band doesn't see the device.\n\nA: I think that the device setting that you are looking for is only for microphone and sound output.  You should see a section a little lower that says the number of MIDI devices detected.\nSo when you start the application, choose the Software Instrument after first connecting the keyboard.  When you record, notes hit on the keyboard should appear in the window and play on the speakers.\n\nA: GarageBand can only accept MIDI inputs.  This \"just works\" as noted in the other Answer here.   You can record notes from a MIDI instrument in GarageBand.\nGarageBand cannot control (output) MIDI instruments and cannot produce MIDI files.  There are third party software hacks that allow you to do this but it's not a feature of GarageBand.\nSources:\n1\n2\n", "Q: How do I join my Apple TV to a different home?

I want this codec for my older OS. Where can I find it? Apple has a page listing \"Media formats affected by the transition to 64-bit technology\":\n\nIn macOS versions up to and including macOS Mojave, third-party software has extended the QuickTime 7 framework to support many incompatible media formats. In macOS Catalina, the QuickTime 7 framework will no longer be available, so incompatible formats won't be supported in Final Cut Pro, Motion and Compressor.\n\n\nHere are examples of media formats affected by this transition:\n\nThe second item on the list of affected formats reads:\n\nAV1 / VP9\n\nI am on an older version of macOS, and I would very much like to have native support for VP9 in QuickTime! Unfortunately, I am not aware of any QuickTime components that add compatibility with VP9. Perian, which is listed seperately, only ever supported up to VP8.\nWas there ever a VP9 QuickTime Component, and if not, what is Apple's page referring to? I am looking for the name of the specific software being referenced.\n\nA: Welp, I'm still not sure whether there ever was a VP9 component, but there is now because I made one. I managed to update FFusion (the core component of Perian) to work with a newer version of libavcodec.\nhttps://github.com/Wowfunhappy/FFusion\nAt long last, I can watch 4K Youtube videos in QuickTime Player 10.2. \n\nA: \nWas there ever a VP9 codec, and if not, what is Apple's page referring to?\n\nNo, there is no Quicktime Player plugin that adds VP9 codec support to it (as far as I know). Apple is referring to codecs built on Quicktime Framework.\nQuicktime Framework is a multimedia library provided on macOS.\nThe Quicktime Player app, Quicktime Broadcaster, QuickTime Streaming Server etc. all use the Quicktime framework to play videos and / or manipulate them (edit or re-encode them).\nMany video editors on macOS use the Quicktime Framework too, to add support for codecs (like VP9) for use in these video editor apps.\n(Note: Codec support added to an app doesn't make it available to ALL apps that use the framework - so for example, Quicktime Player will not be able to automatically use VP9 codec added to another app just because it is using the Quicktime Framework).\nWith macOS Catalina, Apple has now replaced the old QuickTime 7 Framework with a new Quicktime X framework. Due to this big change, any codec built on the old Quicktime 7 Framework will no longer work on macOS Catalina.\nMore info here: Apple is killing QuickTime 7 in macOS 10.15.\n(However, this doesn't mean that VP9 (or other codecs) cannot be used to watch VP9 / webM videos on macOS Catalina. You can still watch VP9 encoded videos using other media players like MPV, VLC or IINA on macOS Catalina. You can also create / encode VP9 media with Handbrake on macOS Catalina.)\n\nA: There were AV1/VP9 QuickTime 7 framework extensions by third-parties as clearly stated. There was never an AV1/VP9 VP9 QuickTime 7 Component. That is the answer to your question.\nIt seems you have misunderstood the software architecture by confusing the names together.\nTo put it briefly,\nQuicktime 7 ≠ Quicktime 7 framework ≠ Quicktime 7 framework extensions by third parties ≠ Quicktime 7 Component\nAlthough they are similar and interrelated they are logically, architecturally, and semantically distinct constructs.\nFor a partial summary see: apple.com/euro/quicktime/pdf/QuickTime7_User_Guide.pdf For the full details, the documentation is not publicly available. They would be internal engineering documents.\nOn what exactly the difference is:\nThough the name is indicative, as a ‘framework extension’ directly extends the framework, i.e augments the framework with some additional capacity that may or may not augment the usable functionality of quicktime itself, whereas a component does augment the usable functionality but may or may not directly extend the framework, it could just plug-and-play into the existing framework.\nIn regards to specific software, since they were created by third-parties you would have to look up which were involved with Quicktime 7, as far as I know Apple doesn’t have a public list of who did what.\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure Finder to report hard-links size only once? I've created multiple hard-links to a file in a folder to illustrate the issue.\n~/Test $ ln original.pdf link1.pdf\n~/Test $ ln original.pdf link2.pdf\n~/Test $ ls -li\n403963 .rw-r--r--@ 3 80k username 2017-11-29 20:17 original.pdf\n403963 .rw-r--r--@ 3 80k username 2017-11-29 20:17 link1.pdf\n403963 .rw-r--r--@ 3 80k username 2017-11-29 20:17 link2.pdf\n\nYou can see above they all have the same inode: 403963.\nThe du utility reports the total size of the folder as the size of the actual data pointed at by those links.\n~/Test $ du -sh .\n 80K  .\n\nBut Finder's adds up each of the link's size (plus something else) when reporting the folder size in the \"Get Info\" window. If you're wondering why it says \"4 items\", I guess it's because it also counts the folder itself. There are definitely only those three files in the \"Test\" folder.\n\nIs there any option to configure Finder to count multiple hard links to the same inode only once?\n\nA: The short answer is there is no option to configure Finder to count multiple hard links to the same inode only once. The Finder reports the sum of the current sizes of all files and folders contained within a folder. Extra storage required for versioning is not included and saving in storage though the use of copy-on-write or multiple hard links to the same file is not reported.\nA longer Explanation of How APFS Allocates Storage\nThe size value displayed in OP's image is the sum of the sizes of the files in the folder. The OP wants this to be the space occupied by the files in the folder. This is what the OP thinks du -sh . command does, but this would be incorrect. Under APFS there is copy-on-write. The du -sh . command does not take this in account and thus can report an incorrect value.\nBelow is an example.\nThe commands below create a 60 MB file named original in a folder name test on a 100 MB APFS volume named question.\nhdiutil create -size 100M -type UDIF -fs APFS -volname question ~/Desktop/question.dmg\nhdiutil attach ~/Desktop/question.dmg\nmkdir /Volumes/question/test\ncd /Volumes/question/test\ndd if=/dev/zero of=original bs=60000000 count=1\n\nBelow is an image from Get Info of the test folder and question volume. The test folder uses 60 MB and the question volume uses a slightly larger amount do to other smaller files and folders.\n\nThe output from the commands ls -li and du -sh . are given below. Here, the du -sh . command outputs 57 MiB with agrees with the 60 MB size of the original file. (57 MiB = 60 MB)\n$ ls -li\ntotal 117192\n19 -rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 original\n$ du -sh .\n 57M    .\n\nNext, the command show below was entered, which uses copy-on-write to make a copy of the original.\ncp -c original copy\n\nThe image below shows the test folder has doubled in size. This is the sum of the sizes of the files original and copy. The volume question has not changed in size.\n\nThe output from the commands ls -li and du -sh . are given below. Here, the du -sh . command outputs the sum of the sizes output by the command ls -li. (114 MiB = 120 MB)\n$ ls -li\ntotal 234384\n21 -rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 copy\n19 -rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 original\n$ du -sh .\n114M    .\n\nNext, the command show below was entered, which created a new hard link named link to the original file.\nln original link\n\nBelow is an image from Get Info of the test folder and question volume. Again, the used space in the question volume has not changed. The size of the test folder has tripled from the original size of 60 MB.\n\nThe output from the commands ls -li and du -sh . are given below.\n\nThe value output from the du -sh . command is neither the space occupied by the files nor is the value the sum of the file sizes.\n\n$ ls -li\ntotal 351576\n21 -rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 copy\n19 -rw-r--r--  2 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 link\n19 -rw-r--r--  2 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 original\n$ du -sh .\n114M    .\n\nTherefore, there would be no reason for an option to configure Finder to count multiple hard links to the same inode only once. In other words, there is no reason to create an option replicate a value with may not represent a meaningful value. The OP wants Get Info on folder to present the space used by the files in the folder. This would be a difficult (and therefore time consuming) value to determine. For example, the following command was entered to overwrite the first 30 MB of the original file.\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=30000000 count=1 of=original conv=notrunc\n\nThe image below shows the test folder size is unchanged. However, the volume question used space has increased by approximately 30 MB.\n\nThe output from the commands ls -li and du -sh . are given below. The original and link files still have the same inode number, but now do to copy-on-write only the last 30 MB of these files is shared with the last 30 MB of the copy file. So, while the file sizes have not changed, 30 MB of disk space needed to be allocated to hold the 30 MB of zeroes written out by the dd if=/dev/zero bs=30000000 count=1 of=original conv=notrunc command. Again the ls -li command does not show any change.\n$ ls -li\ntotal 351576\n21 -rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  1 19:32 copy\n19 -rw-r--r--  2 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  2 02:00 link\n19 -rw-r--r--  2 davidanderson  staff  60000000 Jan  2 02:00 original\n$ du -sh .\n114M    .\n\nDetermining the amount of space used by a folder is more complicated than just looking at the file size and ignoring a size when a duplicate inode number is found. The Get Info for a volume can do this by simply subtracting the free space from the total space to get the used space. The Get Info for a folder would have to make sure a block or sequence of blocks are not be counted more than once. IMO, macOS does not do this because doing so would be to time consuming. To be fair, I could be wrong about this. For example, WGroleau has expressed essentially the opposite view.\n", "Q: WhatsApp web interface in Safari reloads because it is using \"significant energy\" how to fix? I'm using Safari on a MacBook Air M1.\nWhen I use web.whatsapp.com, it often reloads page with this error:\n\nIs there an easy way to fix this?  Is Facebook running necessary processes that I can block somehow?\n\nA: I believe the easiest way to fix this is to use a different browser. Both Firefox and Chrome shouldn't reload web.whatsapp.com or any other website without asking.\nI do not have the latest Safari, but I dug through the latest Safari user guide and it seems there are no options in Safari's preferences to disable reloads due to significant energy consumption.\nIf you still really want to use Safari you might be able to find an extension that will stop these reload events, or you might be able to file a bug with WhatsApp and hopefully they will fix it soon. I do not recommend manually finding and blocking the guilty scripts from web.whatsapp.com. From my web development experience I can assure you that this will not be an easy task.\n", "Q: How can I view finder file comments on iOS? Ideally, I'd like to see these comments in the iOS files app.\n\nA: While it appears that iCloud Drive does actually sync file comments, the Files app unfortunately has no built-in way to read these. Instead, you'll need to use a third-party app to achieve this. The following is a free, fairly straightforward (but limited—see below) approach using Scriptable:\n\n*\n\n*Install Scriptable from the App Store\n\n\n*Launch Scriptable and press the + button in the top right to create a new script\n\n\n*Paste the following:\nconst file = args.fileURLs[0]\nconst fm = FileManager.iCloud()\nif (!fm.fileExists(file)) {\n    QuickLook.present('Invalid file')\n    return\n}\nfm.downloadFileFromiCloud(file)\nconst comment = fm.readExtendedAttribute(file, 'com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment')\nif (comment === null) {\n    QuickLook.present('Comment not found or failed to parse.')\n    return\n}\ntrailer = comment.slice(comment.length - 32, comment.length)\nString.prototype.hexSlice = function (start, end) {\n  return parseInt(this.slice(start, end).split('').map(c => ('0' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2)).join(''), 16)\n}\noffsetTableStart = trailer.hexSlice(24, 32)\noffsetTableOffsetSize = trailer.hexSlice(6, 7)\ntopObjectStart = comment.hexSlice(offsetTableStart, offsetTableStart + offsetTableOffsetSize)\ntopObjectLength = comment.hexSlice(topObjectStart, topObjectStart + 1) & 0x0F\nif (topObjectLength === 0x0F) {\n  lengthPower = comment.hexSlice(topObjectStart + 1, topObjectStart + 2) & 0x0F\n  charsStart = topObjectStart + 2 + Math.pow(2, lengthPower)\n  topObjectLength = comment.hexSlice(topObjectStart + 2, charsStart)\n} else {\n  charsStart = topObjectStart + 1\n}\ntopObject = comment.slice(charsStart, charsStart + topObjectLength)\nQuickLook.present(topObject)\n\n\n\n*Tap the settings/\"toggle switches\" icon , tap \"Name,\" and give the script a name (e.g., \"File Comments\")\n\n\n*Tap \"Share Sheet Inputs\" and select \"File URLs\" (then navigate back out by pressing Back > Done)\nNow, whenever you want to view the comment for a file in the Files app, you can:\n\n*\n\n*Select the file and hit the Share icon\n\n\n*Choose the \"Run Script\" action and tap the script you just created (the file comment should appear in an overlay)\nUnfortunately, you'll probably find that the script fails for certain comments. This is because Scriptable can't handle certain characters, and unfortunately there's no way to work around this. (The (brief) technical explanation is that Scriptable attempts to read all extended attributes as strings, but since the comment is actually binary data, it seems to stumble on certain bytes. I don't fully understand why it fails when it does—it's not just on Unicode strings—but the whole approach is a bit hacky to begin with.)\nAn alternative, much more robust approach would be to use Pythonista ($9.99) to directly access the extended attributes and avoid Scriptable's problematic string conversions. Here's a Python script that does what you want (create the script in Pythonista, then press the settings cog and add it under Share Extension Shortcuts):\nimport appex\nimport console\nimport plistlib\nimport ui\n\nfrom objc_util import *\n\ndef main():\n    fp = appex.get_file_path()\n    if not fp:\n        console.hud_alert('Error: Invalid file', 'error')\n        return\n    extd_attrs = ObjCClass('NSFileManager').defaultManager().attributesOfItemAtPath_error_(fp, None)['NSFileExtendedAttributes']\n    if extd_attrs is None:\n        console.hud_alert('No extended attributes found', 'error')\n        return\n    attr_data = extd_attrs['com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment']\n    if attr_data is None:\n        console.hud_alert('No comment found', 'error')\n        return\n    attr_bytes = nsdata_to_bytes(attr_data)\n    comment = plistlib.readPlistFromBytes(attr_bytes)\n    tv = ui.TextView()\n    tv.text = comment\n    tv.editable = False\n    tv.present()\n  \nmain()\n\n(Note that os.getxattr is broken in Pythonista, hence the Objective-C workaround.)\nFor those who are interested, here are some references for the (very, very rough) manual bplist parsing I implemented in JavaScript:\n\n*\n\n*https://medium.com/@karaiskc/understanding-apples-binary-property-list-format-281e6da00dbd\n\n*https://github.com/joeferner/node-bplist-parser/blob/master/bplistParser.js\n", "Q: Transferring iTunes library from an old HDD I have recently purchased a new PC and connected my old SSD and HDD to the new PC.\nMy old HDD has my iTunes library that I would like to transfer to my new PC, however since I cannot boot my old SSD (it is running an old version of windows and I do not have the drivers installed for the new PC) how would I be able to transfer my iTunes?\nThe following files are the only ones I have access to.

There's no alias at play at least, but is there something else going on?\n\nA: This was just zsh caching at play.\nYou need to run rehash after you change $PATH which rebuilds zsh cache and then executables are found as expected.\nSee Section 3.1 of the Z shell guide http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide03.html\n\nThere is a subtlety here. The shell tries to remember where the commands are, so it can find them again the next time. It keeps them in a so-called hash table', and you find the word hash' all over the place in the documentation: all it means is a fast way of finding some value, given a particular key. In this case, given the name of a command, the shell can find the path to it quickly. You can see this table, in the form key=value', by typing hash'.\nIn fact the shell only does this when the option HASH_CMDS is set, as it is by default. As you might expect, it stops searching when it finds the directory with the command it's looking for. There is an extra optimisation in the option HASH_ALL, also set by default: when the shell scans a directory to find a command, it will add all the other commands in that directory to the hash table. This is sensible because on most UNIX-like operating systems reading a whole lot of files in the same directory is quite fast.\nThe way commands are stored has other consequences. In particular, zsh won't look for a new command if it already knows where to find one. If I put a new ls command in /usr/local/bin in the above example, zsh would continue to use /bin/ls (assuming it had already been found). To fix this, there is the command rehash, which actually empties the command hash table, so that finding commands starts again from scratch. Users of csh may remember having to type rehash quite a lot with new commands: it's not so bad in zsh, because if no command was already hashed, or the existing one disappeared, zsh will automatically scan the path again; furthermore, zsh performs a rehash of its own accord if $path is altered. So adding a new duplicate command somewhere towards the head of $path is the main reason for needing rehash.\n\n", "Q: Can i use a 3rd party USB C cable to charge a Macbook pro? Ive got a 2017 MBP which requires a 87 watt charger.\nI use the official apple charger, but can i use any brand USB C cable to connect the charger to the MBP ?\n\nA: Yes, you can use any standards compliant USB-C cable to connect the charger to the MacBook Pro - it doesn't have to be made by Apple.\nNote that a standards compliant USB-C cables is only required to be able to carry 60W of power. High-wattage cables are available that can carry up to 100W of power.\nIn order to get the full output from your charger, you'll want one of the high-wattage cables. However, you won't damage the cable, charger or laptop by using a 60W cable. The charger and laptop will ensure that only 60W of power is actually carried by the cable.\n", "Q: Can a version of Windows newer than Vista be installed on MacBookPro2,2 2006 Core 2 Duo? Apple documents state my MacBookPro2,2 2006 Core 2 Duo 2.16 MHz will not run Windows versions newer than Vista. However, I burned a 32 bit Windows 7 ISO to a DVD, after converting the ISO to DVD/CD master in the Disk Utility. The resulting DVD worked. I tried same procedure with a 32 bit Windows 10 ISO. The Mac froze at a black screen with a message asking for a boot choice 1, 2. Why did booting from the Windows 10 DVD fail?\nI understand that my Mac has a 32 bit EFI, but the processor is 64 bit. I also understand there are issues with booting from an USB flash drive, which is why I used a DVD. Are there other methods to install newer versions of Windows on my Mac?\n\nA: You model Mac can only support only one boot method when booting from the optical drive. The 32 bit Windows 7 installer ISO provide by Microsoft can only be BIOS booted and therefore offers no problems when burn to a DVD. However, any of the Windows 10 installer ISO files provided by Microsoft can be either BIOS or UEFI booted. Using a DVD burned from one of these ISO files to boot your Mac will result in your Mac hanging as described in your question. This is true for both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the Windows 10 installer ISO file.\nSeveral answers involving installing Windows 10 on your model Mac have already been posted. See the question Installing windows on a MacBook Pro 15-Inch “Core 2 Duo” without Mac OS X.\nNote the following:\n\n*\n\n*According to Microsoft, a computer needs at least 1 GB of RAM in order to install 32 bit Windows 10 and at least 2 GB of RAM in order to install 64 bit Windows 10. Your Mac was shipped with 1 GB of RAM, but is capable of being upgraded to at least 2 GB.\n\n*You do not need a license to install and test Windows 10. However, to continue using Windows 10 will require a license. You may be able to install a licensed Windows 7, then upgrade to Windows 10 for free. This was true as of early in 2020. I do not know if this is still true today. Also, if a licensed Windows 10 was previous installed on your Mac, then you will be able to use this existing license.\n\n*Apple only supports running 32 bit Windows XP SP2 or Vista on your model Mac. Therefore, the drivers provided by Apple may or may to work with a 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. However do to the age of your Mac, many of the necessary drivers will probably already be included in the Windows 10 installer software or will be downloaded automatically from Microsoft.\n\nUsing USB to Install Windows 10\nThe basic steps are outline below. An optical drive is not used to install Windows 10.\n\n*\n\n*Use a USB port to install a 32 bit BIOS booting Debian Linux. This will include the Grub boot loader.\n\n*Use Debian Linux to copy the Windows 10 installation files to a NTFS formatted volume on the internal drive.\n\n*Use Grub to BIOS boot the Windows 10 installer on the internal drive.\n\n*Install a BIOS booting Windows 10. This will overwrite Grub and Debian Linux.\n\n*Expand the Windows 10 partition to consume the space occupied by the partitions containing the Windows 10 installer files and the Debian Linux swap space.\n\nA more detailed version of above steps is given below. These steps can be used to install either a 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows 10.\n\n*\n\n*Install 32 bit BIOS booting Debian Linux. Follow steps 1 through 4 given in this answer with the following exception. When asked to Configure the package manager, choose a Debian archive mirror country followed by a Debian archive mirror.\n\n\n*Prepare a partition for the Windows installation files. Start by booting to Debian. If the Mac does not boot to Debian (via Grub) by default, then restart the Mac and immediately hold option key until the Startup Manager icons appear. Select the internal drive icon labeled Windows. If a Debian desktop environment was not installed, login as root. Otherwise, login using the default username, open a Terminal window and enter the command shown below.\nsu --login\n\nThe middle partition on the internal drive (/dev/sda3) contains an ext4 formatted volume. The command given below will replace this volume with a NTFS formatted volume. A connection to the internet is required.\napt update\napt install exfat-fuse exfat-utils ntfs-3g parted\nsed -i '/\\/installation/d' /etc/fstab\numount /dev/sda3\nsfdisk --part-type /dev/sda 3 7\npartprobe\nmkfs.ntfs -L WINSTALL -Q /dev/sda3\nmount /dev/sda3 /installation\n\n\n\n*Create a Windows 10 installer on an internal drive partition.\nEnter a following command to permit writing to the /home folder.\nchmod a+w /home\n\nTransfer, to the /home folder, the ISO file required to install Windows 10. In the case of this example, this would be the Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso file. If your file is different, then make the appropriate substitutions in this step. Below are various ways to transfer this file. Choose one way or find another way.\n\nNote: A choice below can depend on which predefined collections of software are currently installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use another computer to download and transfer the ISO file to a ExFAT formatted USB flash drive. Use either the cp command or the Files application to copy from the USB flash drive to the /home folder.\n\n*Use another computer to download the ISO file. Use sftp on this other computer to transfer the ISO file to the /home folder on the Mac. Enter the command hostname -I on the Mac to get an IP address.\n\n*Use the FireFox ESR application to download the ISO file from the web. Use either the mv command or the Files application to move the downloaded ISO file to the /home folder.\n\nNext, enter the commands given below to copy the Windows 10 installation files from the mounted ISO file to the /installation mount point.\n\nNote: The boot.wim and install.wim files are very large and therefore will take a while to be copied.\n\nmkdir -p /media/iso\nmount -o loop,ro /home/Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso /media/iso\ncp -Rv /media/iso/* /installation\n\nWhen finished, shutdown the Mac. If a Debian desktop environment was not installed, then enter the command below instead.\nshutdown -P now\n\nRemove any USB flash drives that may be plugged into the Mac.\n\n\n*Replace the 32 bit Debian with Windows 10. Start by booting to Grub. If the Mac does not boot to Grub by default, then restart the Mac and immediately hold option key until the Startup Manager icons appear. Select the internal drive icon labeled Windows. When an image similar to the one shown below appears, press the C key.\n\nEnter the commands given below to boot from the /dev/sda3 partition.\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\ninsmod ntldr\nset root='(hd0,msdos3)'\nparttool (hd0,msdos1) type=7 boot+\nntldr /bootmgr\nboot\n\nProceed with the installation of Windows.  When you reach the window shown in the image below, select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\n\nWhen the window shown in the image below appears, leave Drive 0 Partition 1 highlighted and click on the Format button. Next, click on the OK button in the popup window. Finally, click on the Next button.\n\nProceed with the installation of Windows 10.\n\n\n*Install the Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software). The Boot Camp Support Software is on the Snow Leopard installation DVD. The files can be accessed from Windows. Officially, only 32 bit versions of Windows can be installed on your Mac. Since I do not have your model Mac, I can not predict how difficult it will be to the adapt the software for use with a 64 bit Windows. You should consult lx07's answer for more information.\nA Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) ISO file can be downloaded from the website Mac OS X Snow Leopard Install DVD. You should verify the download by computing the SHA256 hash value. The Get-FileHash Power Shell cmdlet can be used to compute a SHA256 hash value. Entering Get-FileHash along with the path to the downloaded file in a Power Shell window should produce the following SHA256 hash value.\nCBEEB2378C40B20A9B06236F567DE593E9030A0A865515B50CF6D35833E25CD5\n\nUnder Windows 10, the Boot Camp Support Software can be accessed by mounting this ISO file.\n\n\n*Remove unnecessary partitions and extend the Windows 10 partition. Boot to Windows 10 desktop. Next, right click on the Start button and select Disk Management. A windows similar to the one shown below will appear.\n\nRight click on the last partition shown for Disk 0. Select Delete Volume…, as shown below. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the free space shown for Disk 0. Select Delete Partition…. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the partition with the volume label WINSTALL. Select Delete Volume…. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the partition with the drive letter C:. Select Extend Volume…. In the popup window, click on the Next button. Again, in the next popup window, click on the Next button. In the next popup window, click on the Finish button.\n\nThe result is shown below.\n\nExit the Disk Management application.\nSetting BIOS Booting as the Default\nIf a BIOS booting Windows is the only operating system installed on a Mac, then the Mac should automatically boot to Windows. However, if BIOS booting has not be set as the default, there may be a delay before booting begins. Otherwise, the Mac Startup Manager can be used to boot Windows. Below are two methods for setting BIOS booting as the default.\n\n*\n\n*Method 1: Boot from an OS X (macOS) installation DVD or USB flash drive, open a Terminal window and enter the command given below.\n bless --device /dev/disk0 --setBoot --legacy\n\nThe version of OS X (macOS) chosen must be compatible with your Mac. The instructions for creating a Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) installation USB flash drive can be found here.\n\n\n*Method 2: A successful installation of the Boot Camp Support Software (Window Support Software) will include the creation of the Boot Camp control panel for Windows.\nTo set the default operating system in Windows:\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, click the Boot Camp icon in the system tray and choose Boot Camp Control Panel.\n\nNote: Your screen may look different, depending on which computer you’re using.\n\n\n\n*Select the startup disk with the Windows operating system as the default.\n\n*If you want to start up that operating system now, click Restart.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to dual boot an iMac 2020, 27\", T2 from (Catalina & Mojave) I need to add a Mojave partition to my native Catalina iMac 2020, 27\", T2.\nTo date all attempts to boot from a Mojave external install drive have failed. \"Secure Boot\" is set to \"No Security\" and \"External Boot\" is set to \"Allowed\". Catalina just shows a \"No Entry\" sign after selecting the Mojave Installer drive. I know this machine will support Mojave. I am able to boot exclusively from a Catalina external install drive. If I wipe the computers internal hard drive from a Catalina external install drive will I be able to access the machine and install Mojave? If so how do I proceed? Any other possible scenarios. What about target disk mode?\nThanks again.\n\nA: Your iMac shipped with Catalina.  Generally, Apple does not support using an OS older than what the device originally shipped with.  Yes, there are the occasional exceptions.  Unfortunately, your model is not one of them.\nIf you really need to run Mojave on your system, then you should probably consider running it within a virtual machine.\n", "Q: Why don't I see a Messages icon in iCloud.com? I have my Messages on my iPhone and MacBook backed up to iCloud. I accidentally deleted a convo on my phone and wanted to retrieve it. When I logged into iCloud.com I don't see an icon for Message. Both my devices are set to back Messages to iCloud, so why don't I see it on iCloud.com?\n\nA: The iCloud.com web interface doesn't provide a Messages web app. In other words, iMessage can only be accessed from the app on your iOS device or Mac. From Apple's Messages in iCloud support page:\n\nYou can use Messages in iCloud on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, and Mac. For your privacy, Messages in iCloud is end-to-end encrypted, which means you can't view or access Messages online via browser.\n\nMoreover, iCloud only provides recovery options for deleted contacts, calendars, reminders, web bookmarks and reading list, and files, per Apple's support document on restoring deleted iCloud content. It is, therefore, not possible to recover deleted iMessages from iCloud in this manner.\nIf you have a backup of your phone with the messages in question (either to iCloud or your computer), you could restore your phone to that backup to recover the messages. Be aware, however, that restoring to a backup will reset your entire phone to its state at the time when the backup was made. If you have a local backup of your phone (i.e., one made through iTunes or Finder), there exists third-party software for Mac that may allow you to extract contents (e.g., messages) of the backup without restoring it; it is worth vetting such tools carefully, however, and I'm not familiar enough with the available options to provide a recommendation here.\n", "Q: On MacOS, how do you delete history without deleting cookies and cache? I can't seem to find the option to do so. Also, I'm on Big Sur if that's relevant.\n\nA: Open safari and press ⌘Y, then press ⌘A, right click (Or control click) and select delete.\nIf you just want to delete some, then ⌘Click the days or sites you want to delete and then right click (Or control click) and select delete.\n", "Q: Looking to create a keyboard shortcut to open the Share menu I understand how to create a custom keyboard shortcut to a specific app within a nested menu, but does anyone know how to open the Share menu from the Menu Bar via a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: macOS doesn't need to open a menu to find a sub-menu item, so long as the menu item is unique.\nFrom your example, you can't open Share itself, but you can directly key command for instance \"Messages\"\nIn System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, select All Applications then click the + underneath, add the exact name of the menu item (this includes any ellipsis … if there is one, which is not the same as three full stops … ) then underneath, your trigger, which can be anything that doesn't conflict.\nThis requirement for a full exact name does mean you cannot use this method for any 'smart' menu item that changes its name depending on context.\n\nIf, on the rare occasion the same command appears in two places in any menu structure, then you can direct to the correct instance by using this syntax to follow the correct path Edit>Share>Messages but for normal use you don't need the path.\n", "Q: MacBook Air with Bootcamp, wanting removable Linux devices without rEFInd Most of the questions here similar to my question regard triple booting and using rEFInd, which I'm not trying to do.\nMy Mac drive is only 128GB, and I've cut into that with Bootcamp, so I'm looking to boot Linux distros via microSD. So far, I've only gotten a Chrome OS on a microSD workable from the Mac's boot menu, but I'm failing to get Ubuntu.\nThis mentions something similar: Linux on Macbook, dual-boot, without rEFind, but it's for Dual boot. I did try taking their advice of copying the ../ubuntu/grubx64.efi to ../boot/bootx64.efi, but the results were goofy. With the microSD inserted, the boot menu still only displayed MacBook and Windows, and when selecting Windows, I got the MokManager error, but it still booted into Ubuntu anyway after leaving it for about 30 seconds. When removing the microSD and booting to that volume, Windows boots to the Grub bash screen. The only way I've found to fix this is to replace bootx64.efi with the Windows version. Basically the same problem you run into after installing Linux to an external drive when Bootcamp is already using that EFI folder.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu to the microSD (/dev/sdc), I also installed the grub bootloader to the sdc volume which I was installing Ubuntu on, so that the bootloader did not damage my Mac OS or Windows boot processes.\nI have tried deleting the Secure Boot option (shimx64.efi) to deal with this, but that causes Ubuntu to fail to boot anymore from microSD. So does replacing the Windows/bootmgfw.efi -> boot/bootx64.efi, although that lets me boot Windows again.\nOf course, I'm trying to get it so that a separate menu item that says \"Ubuntu\" (and all future distros) when inserted, as I'd like to make use of other microSDs and USBs for the same purpose.\nHow should I go about altering the EFI folder and items, without causing Bootcamp to fail? (I've already mucked up that boot several times when testing different options, so I keep restoring from a backup folder.)\nIs there a file in the EFI folder I need to edit to add volumes to be added to the boot menu?\n\nA: IMO, a micro SD is not designed for the amount of read/writes that would occur when an operating system such as Ubuntu is installed. However, other users have posted questions where this is what they have done. So, I assume do so is feasible.\nThe Ubuntu installer does allow selection of where to put the Grub boot files. However, my experience has been the installer ignores any such selection and installs the Grub boot files in the first EFI partition on /dev/sda. From the description of the problems you are having, I assume this is true for your installation. Perhaps you meant the rest of the Grub files were installed in the /boot folder on the micro SD card (/dev/sdc).\n\nAn answer explaining how to separate the Windows boot files from the Ubuntu (Grub) boot files has already been posted here at Ask Different.\n\nI should point out the BOOTX64.EFI file provided by the Ubuntu installer is the file the Mac Startup Manager finds and causes an icon to be displayed. This file is not a duplicate of the grub boot file grubx64.efi, but is instead a duplicate of the shimx64.efi file. My experience has been booting by using this file works, but do so also makes Ubuntu the default startup operating system.\nChanging the label for the icon displayed on the Mac Startup Manager boot menu from the default of EFI Boot can be accomplished by using the macOS bless command. See the question How can I change the title of a boot image?. In your case, you should specify the folder containing the BOOTX64.EFI file.\nThere is no file in the EFI folder that can be edited to add volumes to the Mac Startup Manager boot menu. Instead additional items can be added by creating additional EFI partitions. Newer Macs firmware has been extended to include any Microsoft Basic Data partition which has been FAT or ExFAT formatted. Each partition needs to contain a EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI file. I should also point out that there exists other configurations that will result in a icon being displayed on a Mac Startup Manager boot menu.\nThe icon displayed on a Mac Startup Manager boot menu can also be customized by adding a .VolumeIcon.icns file to the root folder of the volume contained by the EFI partition. Care must be taken to insure the .VolumeIcon.icns file is of a format compatible with the firmware on the Mac logic board. Prebuilt icon set (.icns) files can be downloaded from this site. Also, included is script for creating new icon set files.\n", "Q: How to sort column by numbers in Numbers? I would like to sort a column in ascending or descending order by number of objects in Numbers.

Removing the letters should revert to natural sorting.\nMoving the words to a separate column should fix it.

I found them in this folder /usr/local/bin\n\nA: Probably, yes, since it's in /usr/local/bin (and so aren't the macOS system versions of python). However, you probably shouldn't just delete the executables from that directory, but the whole installation. The details of this will depend on how you did the installation, for example from Python.org, or homebrew, or anaconda.\n\nA: The system version of python2 does not come with pip by default. You can either install pip by itself, or it gets installed if you've installed a newer version of python2.7 from python.org.\nHowever: modules installed by pip2 for use by other python2 installations can also be accessed by the system python. pip itself is very small, but deleting it won't remove the modules.\nIn short, whichever version of python2 you keep, it's useful to keep pip as well, if you plan to install any third-party modules.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro can't see my android phone WiFi hotspot My MacBook Pro pro can't see my Android phone wifi hotspot, when I got the phone new the MacBook was seeing the hotspot and I was connecting to it but after some months it stopped seeing the network.

I have bought the the necessary storage, but I don't want to make a mistake and lose the photos.\n\nA: iCloud is a syncing service, so any photos you delete on the phone will also get deleted in iCloud. This is obviously not what you want.\nYou can configure the phone to automatically manage local storage though by opening Settings, scrolling down to Photos and selecting the \"Optimize iPhone storage\" option. This will store the full resolution photos in iCloud while just keeping a low-res version on the phone itself.

Also, there are many different filesystem types and drives, so be sure your tool supports your OS and Hardware if you don’t try them for free first.\nDo you have a backup? If not, do that immediately. You may need recovery software for this if the mechanism is failing. Disconnect the drive immediately if this is the case and buy a new drive that’s larger (or as large) as the drive so you can copy off the files before any more attempts to “fix” it.

Because I have limited use of my hands, I use Voice Control to dictate most of my text. (I'm using it to speak this question.) Voice Control offers the ability to add custom commands, including those that will run an Automator workflow. Automator, in turn, can execute arbitrary JavaScript or AppleScript. (I prefer JavaScript). What I want to do is to create a script that takes the currently selected text in whatever application is active, manipulates it, and then replaces the selected text in place. For example, imagine creating a \"hyphenate this\" command that converts selected text like this—\"Mac Voice Control scripting\"—and changes it to this—\"Mac-Voice-Control-scripting\". Writing the JavaScript or AppleScript to transform the string is the easy part. The problem is how to get the currently selected text for the current application, whatever it may be.\nIn Automator, you can create a \"Quick Action\" workflow that is supposed to pass the currently selected text and enable you to replace it. In practice, however, in Big Sur (at least) I could not get this workflow to receive text from any application. Given a standard run() function, the input array was always of length 0.\nHow do I create a workflow that may be executed by a custom command in voice control that receives, processes, and replaces the currently selected text in the current application?\n\nA: Sorry I have zero knowledge of JavaScript but I do have somewhat of a solution for you using only AppleScript without the need for Automator.\nThis following AppleScript code will take the selected text in any application, replace the spaces with hyphens then will replace your original selected text with the new hyphenated text.\n-- Copies Selected Text To The Clipboard\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}\ndelay 0.1\n\n-- Uses The Text From The Clipboard And Replaces Space Characters With A Hyphen\nset hyphenatedText to hyphenateText(the clipboard, \" \", \"-\")\ndelay 0.1\n\n-- Inserts The New Hyphenated Text Replacing The Original Selected Text\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke hyphenatedText\n\n(* \nsomeText is the selected text containing the characters to be replaced\nreplaceTheseListItems are characters from original text which you want replaced\nreplacementListItems replacement text characters \n*)\non hyphenateText(someText, replaceTheseListItems, replacementListItems)\n    set originalText to someText\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to replaceTheseListItems\n    set tempText to text items of originalText\n    set text item delimiters to replacementListItems\n    set cleanedText to tempText as text\nend hyphenateText\n\nSave the AppleScript code as a .scpt file (Hyphenate Selected Text.scpt).

The Schwinn trainer app automatically updates Apple Health.  My problem is, that when I look at Apple Health, it shows the time of my exercise with the time an hour later than I actually rode the bike.  That causes the exercise to show up on the next day in the Lose-It app if I complete my exercise after 11:00 PM.  The time on my exercise bike, the Schwinn Trainer app and my iphone are all in sync.  Does Apple Health have it's own time zone setting?\n\nA: Apple Health does not have it's own time zone setting. It will respect the time zone provided by the app saving the workout. If you go to Health > Workouts > Show All Data and open the workout, there will be a Time Zone entry. My time zones currently show \"Eastern Standard Time\" for workouts completed yesterday.\nYours should show whatever timezone you're currently in.

As you may understand the hash (aka pound) is essential in configuration files where it can comment out lines that are not needed. So how do I get the correct encoding/representation bw Terminal, external (lenovo) keyboard and macbook pro?\nAny suggestion/workaround that I may try?\n\nEDIT1\nin Terminal '~' is apparently obtained with Alt + 5. See picture for result of this key combo:\n\nI get some \"arg5\" -- what's that now?\n\nA: Go to Terminal > Preferences > Keyboard and uncheck the box for Use Option as Meta Key.\n\nA: Found a workaroud -- just installed iTerm2 from the Internet. Works alright, so far -- tilde and pound are both rendered correctly, still discovering its features.\n\nA: Macs don't have an AltGr key. You have to press Ctrl & Opt together to achieve the same thing… except no keyboard letter uses ctrl/opt, all available letters are under combinations of opt & shift.\nOn a British keyboard set to Italian, then # is on just opt à.\nYou can test this in the Keyboard Viewer, accessible in the language switch menu item.\n", "Q: iCloud & Work + Personal Account I'm curious to see how others are managing iCloud between their work computers and iOS devices (especially in the WFH world).

LangLangC has given a very detailed answer as to how to disable the discrete Radeon graphics card in a 2011 MacBook Pro.  It seems to be highly regarded, because it got a +97 score:\n\n*\n\n*GPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen\nBut there is also a Mac app called gfxCardStatus, which allows one to \"Manually switch to Integrated Only or Discrete Only mode to force one GPU on or the other\":\n\n*\n\n*https://gfx.io/\nDoes LangLangC's method have any advantages over simply using gfxCardStatus?\n\nA: gfxCardStatus disables the automatic graphics switching that macOS performs when a high performance application wishes to use the discrete graphics. When macOS boots, it detects both GPUs and uses software to switch to the discrete graphics when required. Since both GPUs are detected on boot, both GPUs are powered up, though the discrete graphics quickly switch into a lower power mode until required.\nDisabling the discrete graphics using the kext method completely disables the discrete GPU so it doesn't power on. This is especially useful if the GPU has an issue that causing the machine to kernel panic. The gfxCardStatus method wouldn't prevent this, but the kext changes would.\n", "Q: How can I send rendered Markdown files to the printer from the command line?

How to convert from a Markdown file, to PDF may be a bit dated but lists some options on how to accomplish this.\n\nAny output device (be it a Terminal, be it a Printer) uses control codes within the data to display in order to render it properly, usually these control codes are different for each device. Sometimes (e.g. for Postscript or PDF) they are even a whole language on its own.\nNow lp relies on CUPS to talk to the printer, CUPS usually only understands how to handle plain text, PostScript, PDF, and image files directly. So you can do cat foo.md | lp/lp foo.md or cat foo.pdf | lp/lp foo.pdf to print the plain markdown file or any PDF. If you send text formatted for terminal output (as mdcat does) it will not lead to the expected result (neither does running man lp | lp usually).\n", "Q: How do I change the icons and labels in the MacOS boot manager? I freshly installed Big Sur with Windows 10 Boot Camp on a late-2013 MacBook Pro Retina with a replaced SSD. When I hold down the option button at boot, the options are listed as \"EFI Boot\" (Windows 10) and \"Macintosh HD\", but both are using external drive icons instead of internal. Under MacOS, the icons for both drives appear correctly as internal drives. I tried changing drive names in diskutil, renaming the drives in the MacOS Disk Utility and under Windows, placing .VolumeIcon.icns files in various places, and various bless commands.\nI'm asking this to answer my own question, I couldn't quite find a correct solution in any one spot. Pay close attention to the folders involved, this was the important part.\n\nA: Rename “EFI Boot” in Startup Manager:\nOpen up a Terminal and use the following commands:\ndiskutil list - use this to find the Windows EFI partition\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1 - whereas \"disk0s1\" is your EFI partition\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Boot --label Windows - whereas \"Windows\" is your label of choice\nRename “Macintosh HD” in Startup Manager\nSimilar to above, but:\nsudo bless --folder /System/Volumes/Data --label MacOS - whereas \"MacOS\" is your label of choice\nMissing/Wrong Boot Manager Icon\nReboot in recovery mode (command+R at boot) and use a terminal to run\ncsrutil disable\n… which disables SIP protection\nFor Mac side:\nsudo cp /System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/Internal.icns /System/Volumes/Preboot/.VolumeIcon.icns\nThis will change the Mac/Macintosh HD boot icon to the default internal drive icon, but you can just copy whatever .icns file you wish to that location.  See other posts for info on making your own .icns files.\nFor Windows side:\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1 - Whereas disk01 is the name of your Windows EFI partition from above\nsudo cp /System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/Internal.icns /Volumes/EFI/.VolumeIcon.icns\nDon't forget to enable SIP protection again, if you wish, by booting back into recovery mode and using:\ncsrutil enable\n\nA: thanks for parfpony,\nI have just few comments about BigSur 11.1\n\n*\n\n*If anyone face the problem that the following command is not changing the \"windows\" to new the volume label \"WIN\", after mounting EFI volume :\n\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Boot --label WIN\njust replace the \"label\" by \"file\", that is ..\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi --file WIN\nor\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi --file \"WIN 10\"\nquotes  are used in case your new label(WIN 10) contains spaces.\n\n\n*Related to Icon replacement it can be done easily by using old method without\nusing any scripts or terminal command (for both Mac and windows volumes):\na.  Use Finder preferences --> General ---> Show hard disk, to display your\nvolumes on desktop.\nb.  Select “Macintosh HD” Volume (MacOS volume) then use right click --> “Get\nInfo”--> select the small hard disk image located in upper left corner.\nc.  Choose any icon, with an extension *.icns and NOT Jpeg or PNG images, and\ndrag it on the small image (step b), you will see that the desktop volume\nicon is automatically changed.\nd.  You can use “image2icon” application from apple store to convert your\nfavourite images to icons (1024X1024 pixel) with an extension “.icns”.\n\n\n*If you installed \"BigSur 11.1\" from scratch or clean install, the account name\nchosen will be the macOS volume name displayed directly in boot start up\nmanager and no need for renaming.\nSo Easy !!!!!!!!\n\nA: barfpony, I really appreciate your help!

If it is hard for you to type the location of the new icon, just drag-and-drop the new icon into terminal window. This will generate the location of the file automatically.\n\n\n*Once its done, reboot and press and hold the option (⌥) to check the new label and icon appears.\n\n\n*If you succeeded, do not choose either macOS or Windows disk; press command (⌘)+R.

I work in a company since 2015 and when I joined I was handed over a new MacBook which was the latest at that time i.e 2015 Mid model i7 16GB Ram. This company does not have a rotation policy for the hardware allocated to employees at all. So they will end up repairing and replacing parts till its no longer viable.\nMy profession is mobile development so I would require the latest versions of macOS and Xcode all the time. Of late it has become difficult to work on the said MacBook and its sluggish all the time. I had put in a request to replace the Mac with the system team and it was simply shot down saying that the current config is good enough. I replied politely indicating the Geekbench scores for the 2015 model and the latest Intel MacBook. But again I was shot down just saying that 16GB Ram and i7 is more than enough. I understand that the current MacBook configs are not bad, but it is indeed slower than the latest ones and also 5 years old.\nIf not for geek bench scores how can I put a case to compare older Mac with newer ones ?\n\nEDIT: My current macbook has been repaired a lot already and it still has issues w.r.t battery, heating issues etc ... Display,\nLogic Board & Battery were already replaced last year. All those\nrepairs are pretty expensive, and yet for some reason this is the\nroute which they might want to take still.\n\n\nA: Depending on the corporate environment the case for new hardware may be difficult to make. Things which might work:\n\n*\n\n*Instead of using Geekbench and similar benchmarks (which don't easily translate to actual working experience) it might be better to argue with time wasted due to inadequate hardware etc. You might argue that booting up in the morning takes >5 minutes, or recompiling your applications takes 10 minutes or whatever, and that you use valuable company time just waiting for your computer to finish a task\n\n*It might also be easier to convince your manager (who is more interested in your performance) than the system team (which probably has a limited hardware budget each year). The manager might have better leverage with the system team then\n\n*Assuming you are not the only developer it might also help to join forces with your colleagues and make the case for new hardware together\n\n\nA: With a company policy like that I doubt you'll gain any traction at all until your Mac can no longer run the latest macOS & therefore the latest Xcode.\nIf they're not interested in Geekbench scores I doubt you will find anything else along similar lines to compel them. \"It works, so it is fine.\"\nThe only hope I could see would be if you could make a case for needing Apple Silicon.\n\nA: Are you sure that you MBP is not simply throttling its cpu because there's fluff and dust accumulated inside the cooling system? If it was my own mac book I would service it(remove dust, replace thermal interface, check fans).\nIf it is a macbook of the company I'd argue that as an asset of the company, computer is subject to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation (in some jurisdictions assets like notebooks are not expected to worth anything after several years)  because things become worn out with time - suppose if it was a uniform given by the company for example - obviously it requires replacement.\nActually some sources state that the time of life of the notebook is about 5 years. In my country it has depreciation time of 3 years for example. So it basically should not cost much if you accidently spill tea on it or ask to buy it out - but this of course depends on your jurisdiction.\nSee\nhttps://money.stackexchange.com/questions/73702/irs-useful-life-of-a-laptop-computer\nAlso using a notebook near its end of life is risk for the company because something may go wrong. What if your computer fails just before important presale to the customer?\n\nA: A mid-2015 MacBook Pro still runs all the latest software. There are faster machines, but it is still plenty fast. You would have a case if you need to develop MacOS software that runs on a MacBook with Silicon chip.\nI'd check compile times, and whether you are using pre-compiled headers. I have managed to reduce compile times by a factor 2 for generic code, and by a factor 4 for C++ code, by using pre-compiled headers.\n\nA: I would look at three things\n\n*\n\n*Time is money\n\n*List specific measurable benchmarks ( e.g. launch 4 specific apps each day and time them till usable, script a clean build of a representative app )\n\n*List specific app and OS requirements ( e.g. need N-2 and N+1 beta compatibility for Xcode SDK)\n\nIn the end, you’re appealing to your manager for funding and reasonableness of the “requirements” and not IT for a “blessing” of the age or benchmarks.\nConsider that people are expensive to recruit and train and hardware is cheap. But it’s easy to measure hardware expenses, so that tends to get scrutinized over process (erase and install) or training.\nDo some quick math on “Is it worth it?” and good luck!\n\nIn your case we would send you an identical Mac to your 2017 one that is erased and have you run your chosen tests. Most of our managed Macs need an erase every 2 years and developers tend to need erases much more often since they alter the system so heavily. They understandably complain bitterly when asked to clean (just like system admin do), which is why we send them a second kit to run tests so they aren’t forced to migrate but can do a good test on a clean system. It’s rarely the hardware slowing them down in my experience, but when it is it’s nice to have good data on a clean build so that the budget person doesn’t think the “spec” was made up or not backed by data and testing.\n\nA: Another solution is to look at renting cloud-based resources for the purpose of compiling, and using your existing device as a simple front end/terminal.\nPrice up the cost of AWS \"mac1.metal\" instances and you'll have pure dollar values to support your claim to accountancy types.\n\nA: Companies and clients usually grant requests based on need, not want.\nEven if you get your message across regarding the Geekbench score, I don't see any reason why the latest software wouldn't run on a 2015 MacBook. You need to build a case on why your 2015 model stops you from doing your job.\n\nI'm also a mobile developer. As an anecdote, I once requested funds for a PC upgrade since compile times are long and the IDE was laggy. My client instead extended the deadline. The sluggishness did not stop me from doing my job, but they understood that development will take longer.\nAs a counter-anecdote, with the same client on a different project, I could not run the newest mobile OS version since my phone was not new enough. The new OS had breaking changes which I need to develop around. I told them this and, in mere hours, I had a top-end flagship phone.\n\nVagueness on details due to NDA. Anecdotes happened less than a year ago.\n\nA: Nobody except you cares for benchmarks. That was the wrong tree to bark up to.\nWhat you need is specific use cases. \"I need a new computer because task X must be done on the latest MacOS version, which is no supported on my current machine.\"\nThat it's faster is not an argument. That you can't do your job is.\nSo find which things actually REQUIRE a more recent machine. Ignore your own comfort or speed. Look for things that you actually can't do AT ALL without a hardware upgrade.\nIf you can't find any, then it's time to ask yourself if you really NEED a new machine, or just WANT one. Looking at the question from that perspective will help you find an answer that also convinces IT.\n\nA: I'm a mobile developer as well, and have fought (and both lost and won) this battle several times before.  I've always focused the argument on quantifying the financial benefit to the company by pointing out how much a slower Mac costs them, specifically how slow compile times reduce productive development time.\nFor this I estimate how many minutes a day and hours per month I'm waiting for compiles to complete, and present it as lost development time. Now, the counter-argument is that you can spend that compiling time doing other productive things such as replying to emails, documentation, code review & checkin, etc. But the counter-counter-argument is a faster Mac makes you faster at the rest of your work as well, but it's just hard to quantify. As a former manager, I'd also point out that recruitment is a little bit easier and turnover a bit lower if the company is good about giving developers the best computers and tools, but again a tough benefit to measure.\nThe cost of a brand new top of line MacBook Pro (say $3,200) is less than $100 a month in depreciation and interest (typically Macs retain at least 50% of their value over two years, so that's at most $800 a year in depreciation). My cost to the company is roughly $100 per hour (take your pay, add 7.5% for payroll taxes, and costs of benefits like medical, etc, then divide by total hours a month (not including paid vacation days). So I only need to save 1 hour of compile time to justify the purchase of a brand new MacBook Pro every couple years.\nAlso, you should consider whether this is a company you want to stay with. I always advise young developers to interview for other jobs every year or two, because as you gain skills rapidly most employers have policies that limit how much they will increase your compensation to match your burgeoning market value. And you might find another job that's not just more lucrative, but at a place that has a better attitude about equipping their developers with modern tools, and more enjoyable and challenging work.\nFinally, you might also wait and retry when Apple releases high end Apple Silicon MacBooks. I'm doing my development on a 16 Gb M1 MacBook Air and it's extremely fast, building my project faster than any Intel MacBook, and faster than almost every high end iMac and some iMac & Mac Pros. But it is limited to only a single external monitor and 16 Gb of RAM. When high end Apple Silicon MacBook Pros ship later this year, it's almost certain they will support more RAM, multiple external monitors, and be even faster yet. You should look at requesting one of those, I will be buying one, and selling my MacBook Air after less than a year, because lots of RAM and two big monitors is important to productivity too.\n\nA: Why do you need a better computer, from the company financial perspective?\nThe only acceptable reason is that compiling or some other task is taking an unacceptably long time, so the company is losing money providing you with a less than modern computer.  How many minutes a day would you gain if compilation/debugging performed by a more modern computer?   That's the business case your manager is interested in.  IT/Helpdesk does not care about that.\nOn the other hand, I'd say that the investment on your computer has been amortized after 5 years!\n\nA: If you are thinking of selling then maybe use a site like Mac Recycle. In my experience, they tend to be much fairer than Apple or other larger companies.\n", "Q: Why is my iPad unable to determine location with some hotspots? If its connected through a connected chain looking hotspot, it can determine my location? What’s the reason? Also I’ve searched and found out that the connected chain looking hotspot is only created through apple or xiaomi device. Why is it so, and how can I create that kind of hotspot through other android device?\n\nA: If your iPad doesn't have GPS hardware (available only with cellular models), iOS on it uses an online geolocation service to try determine the location.\nOne of the ways the geolocation services tries to do this is by trying to determine the location of the wifi you have connected to. This works well only if the location of wifi is already known - like cell phone towers, or public wifi hotspots, or wifi routers whose location is already known because of other devices (with GPS) that have connected to it etc. Generally, if you are connected to a cellular data, some cellular providers can also provide limited GPS data but this is also not consistent.\nIn other words, if your device doesn't have built-in hardware for GPS, trying to determine your position through other means are somewhat unreliable. And that is what you are experiencing.\n", "Q: How can I quickly filter by edited photos on iOS? Often I will have many versions of a similar photo.

Sometimes I do not want (or forget) to favorite the edited photo after I edit it.  In addition, sometimes I would like to find a photo I edited months or even years ago.  Is there a way to quickly find edited photos in iOS?\n\nA: There is a feature for filtering photos in the iOS Photos app which allows you to quickly find previously edited photos.  To access this capability click the three dots at the top right of the photos app (the three dots are located next to the \"select\" button).\nAfter pressing the three dots (...) you will see the following screen:\n\nSelect \"Filter\" and the screen below will appear.  On this screen select \"edited\"\n\nFinally select \"Done\" and you will see only your edited photos.\nYou can reverse this by selecting the three dots again, selecting \"Change Filter\" and then setting the filter to \"All Items\"\n", "Q: How can i delete duplicate rows but keep values from specific cells in the row? you can see in the image below there are 5 duplicate rows and what i want to do is to delete all the duplicate rows  expect the game column and the first row and imagine there are many sets like this in the sheet so how can I do this is in one go. Thanks in advance.\n\n\nA: Seems like you actually need to use database software. (See link for Microsoft Access alternatives for Mac.) You should be able to export your spreadsheet directly into the program and that will allow you to manipulate and control the information more granularly.\nOtherwise, the closest thing I could find to what you're trying to accomplish is by using Categories in Apple's Numbers.\n\nIf you need to stick to Excel that's probably going to take some incredibly complex strategies (custom filters, tables, data linking, multiple workbooks, etc.)\n", "Q: OSX Big Sur Window UI turns purple when moved to desktop two The UI on my Macbook Air M1 turns into purple beautifully when the window is moved to Desktop 2.\nThis does not seems to be the tinting feature of Big Sur, since the color turns to black again when moved back to desktop 1.\nDoes any one know what's going on?\nMy purple safari\n\nMy purple settings\n\n\nA: Same issue here.

How can I fix it? Sporadically throughout the day while I'm working on my 2017 27\" iMac running macOS 10.14.6, the entire system will freeze for 5-20 seconds. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it, but it does happen the most when utilizing apps that make use of Accessibility permissions, such as xGestures or BetterTouchTool. I later confirmed (as documented in this question) that the problem is TCC; the system WindowServer process is doing some kind of check to make sure a process has the permissions it needs, and it's getting locked up while doing so, causing the entire system to freeze until it finishes. During these times the cursor still moves, but I can't click anything on screen.\nDoes anyone have any idea what's going wrong here, or how I can fix it?\nSo far I've tried resetting the TCC database using the command tccutil reset All, and while that seemed to make my computer a little snappier at first, as soon as I granted all of the apps I use the permissions they require, the freezes came back. I've also reinstalled macOS from the recovery environment and that didn't fix it either.\nI have a 2019 MacBook Pro running the same version of Mojave with much of the same software installed, and it does not have this issue, for what that's worth.\nI've also read through this question but it's addressing a different TCC-related issue, and using an MDM profile will not help since its purpose is to add apps to the TCC database without requiring user intervention. This question is not about subsecond delays introduced by TCC when launching apps, but a show-stopping bug in TCC where it literally causes the entire mac to become unresponsive for several seconds.\nUpdate 6/17/2021: one of the triggers for this bug appears to be apps that have an invalid or missing signature. I just managed to consistently trigger this bug in an app with an invalid signature where one of its child processes was trying to send Apple events. I then fixed it by resigning the app with my \"Developer ID Application\" certificate. I don't know at this point whether that specific kind of certificate is necessary.\n\nA: I've discovered the problem is apps that are missing a signature, or have an invalid signature.\nIn these cases, whenever they try to access something that requires going through TCC, most of all using AppleScript or Apple events, the entire system will freeze while TCC churns away at... something. My best guess is that it's recalculating a signature for the app in question, and if the app's bundle is quite large, as is the case with some of the invalidly signed apps I was working with, it can take quite a long time. I've discovered that it's reproducible across all of my macOS 10.14 systems.\nWhy the system needs to freeze during this time is beyond me. That strikes me as some very, very bad design. Essentially the entire window server is blocking while waiting for TCC to finish its work. (See this earlier question of mine for how I discovered this is the case.)\nThe solution, more of a workaround really, is to resign the offending app. I've found that using a ad-hoc signature (i.e. codesign -f -s - /path/to/app.app) seems to work.\n", "Q: RAID 5 options on macOS Big Sur? I'm given to understand that Disk Utility in macOS Big Sur does not support RAID options other than RAID 0 and RAID 1.  I've got a multi-drive enclosure that I'd like to setup for RAID 5.  Are there any other options for doing this?  I could do RAID 1 for multiple 2-drive pairs, but would prefer to have a single, large RAID 5 volume.

For decent RAID support, I recommend SoftRAID, which does RAID 0, 1, 4, 5 and '1+0'.\nhttps://www.softraid.com\nThey've recently discontinued their 'Lite' version, and so it's a little more expensive than it was: but there's not much else.\n", "Q: BigSur Blurry Text on external monitor I have looked all over the internet and I have seen this issue popup all the time, but none of the 'fixes' seem to work for me.\nI have recently switched from a pc to a mac.\nI run 3x monitors off my computer and on PC I have had no issues what so ever.\nI have a 2019 MacBookPro which is now running Big Sur.

I had a similar problem as I was using an HDMI to miniDP cable which maxed out at 1080p.\nChanging to a Display Port cable immediately resolved this issue.\nIn my understanding, you need a Display Port cable (version 1.2 or above) that supports higher resolutions (2k or 4k).

I have a MacBook Pro with a 500GB NVMe internal drive. According to this website, the Samsung 850 Pro is under warranty until 300 TBW for a 512 GB drive. Other sources (less conservatively) report double the lifetime of an NVMe to be about 700 TBW.\nI have been monitoring my disk usage for a while now. In the last ten days of uptime, my disk usage has been around 10 TBW and 9 TBR. That means about 1 TB of data is read and written per day. Extrapolating and taking the best case scenario my internal drive would last a maximum of two years before dying. Given that the internal drive can't be replaced, obviously I'm very concerned with my data usage because I expect a Mac to last me at least five years.\nWhat is causing this high amount of data usage, and how do I reduce it to prolong the life of my internal SSD?\nActivity Monitor\n\nTrying to understand this usage, I took a look at Activity Monitor.

Seems to work.\n\n\nA: TL;DR\nYou can do this:\n\n*\n\n*Create an APFS Time Machine volume as normal.\n\n*In Disk Utility, add one or more AFPS volumes to the same container that includes the Time Machine volume, and set a Reserve Size for each (see below for step-by-step instructions). This will effectively limit the size of the Time Machine volume even though it doesn't itself have an explicit quota size.\n\nAdvantages of this approach\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't require the Terminal.\n\n*Relies purely on APFS volumes, without requiring adding a GUID partition (as when adding an APFS Container partition or HFS+ partition).\n\n*You can adjust the maximum size of the Time Machine volume at any time by adding/removing other APFS volumes.\n\nFor example, if the drive has a 4 TB capacity and you want to set aside at least 2 TB for non-TM files, create an APFS volume with a 2 TB Reserve Size. If you want to limit Time Machine to 1 TB, create a third APFS volume with a Reserve Size of 1 TB. If later on you decide you want to increase the Time Machine space limit to 1.5 TB, you can delete that third APFS volume and add a new APFS volume with a Reserve Size of 500 GB.\nAPFS Volumes              Reserve Size   Effective Size Limit\n-----------------------   ------------   --------------------\nVolume 1 (Time Machine)        N/A               1 TB\nVolume 2 (other files)        2 TB\nVolume 3 (can be empty)       1 TB\n\n    |\n    | Remove and re-add Volume 3 with a lower Reserve Size\n    v\n\nAPFS Volumes              Reserve Size   Effective Size Limit\n-----------------------   ------------   --------------------\nVolume 1 (Time Machine)        N/A             1.5 TB\nVolume 2 (other files)        2 TB\nVolume 3 (can be empty)     500 GB\n\nIf desired, you could even eventually move your other files off of the drive (\"Volume 2\" in this example), and allow your Time Machine volume to grow to fill the full drive.\nTesting performed\nI tested this on macOS Big Sur (11.6.1 and 11.6.2) and confirmed that Time Machine (1) will not back up successfully if it requires space reserved by other AFPS volumes, and (2) will prune older backups to free up space for new backups. (In my tests I was giving Time Machine very little space and had very few past backups available to prune, so it would often fail to back up, but I assume that with more space and a normal-length backup history it would always be able to find old backups to prune when needed to free up space for new backups.)\nStep-by-step instructions for adding APFS volumes with a Reserve Size\n\n*\n\n*In Disk Utility, select the container that includes the Time Machine volume, and add an additional APFS volume to it. (Do so by choosing Edit > Add APFS Volume… or by clicking the + symbol under \"Volume\" in the toolbar.)\n\n\n*Click the \"Size Options…\" button, set the Reserve Size, and click \"OK\".\n\nNote: After you set a Reserve Size, click the \"Size Options…\" button again to verify that the correct number is still there! Disk Utility will only allow TB to be set to 2 decimal places, will not allow fractional GB values, and will replace \"1000\" with \"1,000\" and then replace \"1,000\" with \"1\". I know, seriously.\n\n\n\n\n*Click \"Add\".\n\n\nA: The answer you linked to of setting an APFS volume quota is the only strategy I've found.\nNote that this is not partitioning the drive, but rather a volume within an APFS container. The APFS container is the partition on the disk, then within are APFS volumes which can be added and removed at will.\nDisk space is shared between APFS volumes on a container, so you can create a new volume within a container and move files from one volume to another without needing double the disk usage. As files are moved from one volume to another, the total size of files in the container does not increase, as one volume gets smaller at the same time as the other volume gets larger.\nThis makes it very easy to move your Time Machine backup to a new APFS volume with a quota set, within the same APFS container. No disk partitioning required.\n\nA: Apple still supports HFS+ Destination disks so the old method will still work on Big Sur. With macOS 11 you are correct that APFS is preferred and Apple explicitly shows how to split an APFS disk so that not all the disk is used for backup space.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/types-of-disks-you-can-use-with-time-machine-mh15139/mac\n\nNote: The entire APFS disk is reserved for Time Machine backups. If you want to store files other than the Time Machine backup on the same physical device, use Disk Utility to create an additional APFS volume on the disk. The two volumes then share the available space.\n\nIn the above linked pay attention to the two fields - reserve and quota:\n\nIf you want to manually manage APFS volume allocation, click Size Options, enter values in the fields, then click OK.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reserve Size: The optional reserve size ensures that the amount of storage remains available for this volume.\n\n*Quota Size: The optional quota size limits how much storage the volume can allocate.\n\nYou could reserve 100 GB so that no other container deprives your backup space of a minimum of 100 GB and you could also or just add a Quota of 500 GB to make sure your Time Machine volume never consumes more than 500 GB of space from the shared container.\n\nA: You can use the same strategy you would use with any of the other drive formats, namely creating a new partition.\nCreate a new APFS partition (aka container) with a single volume (as opposed to creating a new volume within an existing APFS container.) Time Machine will expand the volume such that it uses the entire container, but it cannot use any space not belonging to the container in which its volume resides.\n\nA: For anyone trying to limit this on their Synology NAS, there is a nice little setting in your Synology shared folder to limit this:\n\nImage taken from part 4: https://dongknows.com/how-to-keep-time-machine-storage-under-control/\n\nA: I tend to prefer sparsebundles for TimeMachine backups, because they are more flexible. For instance, they can be encrypted without having to encrypt the entire partition or use them on a USB drive and later copy them to a NAS server. Also they can reside on drives with different file systems, such as exFAT.\nSparsebundle images can be limited in size or resized easily, as discussed here for example. That means you can use Disk Utility (click on Images > Resize) or the Terminal:\nhdiutil resize -size 30g ~/Documents/filename.sparsebundle\n\n", "Q: Is there a technical reason that new (Apple Silicon) Macs need less RAM? I typically don't upgrade my MacBook Pro until I can buy a machine with at least twice the RAM. (I rarely find the CPU to be the primary limitation of any machine I use.)  When Apple released a MacBook Pro with 64 GB I was interested in getting it, but it would have totaled close to $4000, so I held off and kept using my 16 GB MBP from 2015.   Now my current machine is having issues that I've been unable to resolve, so I'm in a hurry to replace it.  However if I want to buy anything with the new \"Apple Silicon\" M1 chip, it will max out at 16 GB, and anything more will require buying a legacy CPU, which seems ridiculous at this point.\nIs there some reason that the newer machines can do more with the same amount of RAM?  Are they somehow more efficient with memory?  Or is this simply part of rolling out low-end machines first, with no particular technical justification?\n\nA: The 'technical justification' is that the RAM in the Apple Silicon chips is part of the chip itself, it is not a separate entity like all other processors before.\nPresumably, they'll perfect how to enlarge this with successive generations.\nThe broad strokes of how they do this are on the announcement page - https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/\nYou could probably consider this first generation to be a more than adequate 'proof of concept'.\n\nA: You will be fine with 16 GB of ram. It will not feel like your old machine.\nTake this for example:\nThe best selling Android has 12 GB of ram\nThe iPhone 12 Pro has just 6GB of ram\nThe iPhone is MUCH faster and has better performance.\nOkay back to your question:\nbecause of the tighter integration between your Mac, M1, and the manufacturing, you should be fine with 16 GB.\n", "Q: How do I print webpages to PDF on Big Sur?

I am trying to create a backup-USB installer - so I can replace my 128 ssd with a larger one.  I don't have enough space. I backed up with time machine, but still cannot manage to delete enough space (128 gb is literally nothing nowadays).\nIs there a place to directly download the installer so I can copy the installer to an external drive?\n\nA: Download installinstallmacos.py from either:\nhttps://github.com/munki/macadmin-scripts\nor\nhttps://github.com/grahampugh/macadmin-scripts\nFollow the instructions and you can get a regular DMGs.\n\nA: It’s best to use the Mac App Store and System Preferences to download OS from Apple. They chunk it into hundreds of slices, and use accelerated download sources in the CDN that can include local content caching sharing services if you set them up. This means network errors don’t ruin the entire download and speed it greatly.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683\nFollow the guide to install older OS and it always has a link to the latest OS at the top.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201475\nOnce it downloads, copy the installer from Applications folder to your external. If you don’t have enough room, copy files to the external first so you have enough space, then run the installer is my advice. If your backup is solid, just delete some apps and files until you have the 10 GB or so of space needed. Then restore them from backup once the installer is moved off the system.\nYou can also fetch the installer from a command line tool:\nsoftwareupdate --fetch-full-installer\n\n", "Q: Create standalone Safari apps in macOS, like you can with Chrome?

Is there any kind of app available or anything that will allow me to open these no name files with the same application.\n\nA: You can probably open them all with TextEdit, by drag & drop if they don't show anything in 'Open With', though it may not tell you much when you do. You can't add the file types to an app as default, as they often don't really have a file type.

I am trying to restore data from a folder which I later found is similar to .pages package contents. It has subfolders Index, MetaData, file.zip and some jpeg images as preview. I also came across several other threads 1 2 which all suggests to change the folder extension to .pages or copy contents first and then change etc etc. I have done all that, but Pages [10.3.5] still wont let me open this file. Data in folder is also some encrypted format .iwa. I also searched to understand this format to extract data but it is some kind of compression (Snappy) which I guess can only be read by application (please correct me otherwise).\nSo far I have tried changing extensions and copying contents into a new folder and then change extension. I cannot upload data on Icloud. Is there any other way around to get data back? Is there any editor for .iwa files to read data?\nThanks.\n\nA: The folder was originally a file created in Numbers not Pages.\nSince I was given data as a folder with some .iwa files. When I read on internet about opening those files, all posts were regarding Pages rather Numbers. As package contents were same for both formats (.pages and  .numbers) I kept trying opening the folder (by extending .pages) in Pages.\nLater on I tried Numbers (giving extension .numbers to folder) and it worked instantly.\n", "Q: Kernel panic on shutdown and restart When shutting down my Mac, it takes 1-3 minutes to shutdown.

What, on the other hand, would be the impact of allowing all those large files to become a part of the backup?\n\nA: As you say with each little change in a file will mean it will be backed up again by Time Machine. Often this makes hardly any sense and will bloat the Time Machine backup drive unnecessarily.\nI recommend excluding folders that contain large files and change often from Time Machine backups. To do so, go to System Preferences > Time Machine > Options > +. My exclusion list includes the following paths:\n\n*\n\n*Download folder /Users/[me]/Downloads\n\n*My virtual machines (Parallels Windows, etc.) /Users/[me]/VMs\n\n*Caches, such as Spotify /Users/[me]/Library/Application Support/Spotify/PersistentCache\n\n*Dropbox folders /Users/[me]/Dropbox\nNaturally you should decide for yourself what is meaningful to exclude on your machine and have another backup strategy for those files.\nAlternatively, or on top of that you can use the free utility TimeMachineEditor to lower the time interval of backups (default is one hour). From the webpage:\n\nTimeMachineEditor is a software for macOS that lets you change the default one-hour backup interval of Time Machine. You can change the interval or create other types of scheduling (see the screenshots below).\nThis is useful if you don’t need to backup every hour and don’t want the performance penalty. For example you might be frequently creating or modifying files which would cause long-running backup operations throughout the day.\n\n\n", "Q: In Mac, how to do `tail -f --pid` to terminate after process exit like Linux? tail command in current Linux has --pid option to terminate after certain process id, while tail under MAC OSX doesn't have the same option.\ne.g. tail -f --pid=<process_pid> can terminate tail mode if process_pid terminated.\nSo how can we get the same result as Linux tail -f --pid?\n\nA: There are perhaps several possible ways you can accomplish that.\nFirst solution (easiest): How to replace Mac OS X utilities with GNU core utilities?\nFollow the above and install gnu tail. You can then possibly have a function or alias of tail to gtail. like\nalias tail=gtail\nor even a Bash function:\ntail(){\n  command gtail \"$@\"\n}\n\nor just simply call gtail altogether instead of BSD tail\nSecond solution: The second way of doing that would be to make your own function, which you can add in your bash_profile or make a script, whatever suits you. In this script, all that we are doing is just to check if the PID exists or not. If it exists then we tail otherwise we exit with return code 1.\n_tail(){\n  # usage _tail -f <file> <pid>\n  function _tail::trap() {\n    trap - SIGTERM && kill -- -$$\n  }\n  local FILE=\"$1\"\n  local PID=\"$2\"\n  if ps -p \"$PID\" > /dev/null; then\n    trap _tail::trap SIGINT\n    command tail -f \"${FILE}\" &\n    local pid=$!\n    disown # Optional: if you want to supress the kill SIGINT message\n    local run=true\n    while ${run}; do\n      if ! $(ps -p ${PID} > /dev/null); then\n        kill -9 ${pid} > /dev/null 2>&1\n        run=false\n      fi\n    done\n  else\n    return 1\n  fi\n}\n\nNow, you can call this function like _tail <file-to-tail> <pid>, which will do exactly same thing as gtail -f <file-to-tail> --pid=<pid>\nHowever, if you want, you can extend it further and make it same syntaxt as gnu tail by adding another function called tail and sourcing it in .bash_profile or in your path as executable.\ntail(){\n  # usage: tail -f <file> --pid=<pid>\n  local fFlag=\"$1\"\n  local FILE=\"$2\"\n  local PIDARGS=\"$3\"\n  local PIDARG=\"$(echo ${PIDARGS} | cut -d '=' -f1)\"\n  local PID=\"$(echo ${PIDARGS} | cut -d '=' -f2)\"\n  if [[ \"$fFlag\" == \"-f\" ]] && [[ -f \"${FILE}\" ]] && \\\n    [[ \"${PIDARG}\" == \"--pid\" ]] && [[ $(ps -p \"${PID}\") ]]; then\n    _tail \"${FILE}\" \"${PID}\"\n  else\n    command tail \"$@\"\n  fi\n}\n\n[[ \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" == \"$0\" ]] && tail \"$@\"\n\n\n", "Q: Mute/Unmute Microsoft Teams Microphone Using Mouse Button when Teams is Not Focused I would like to mute and unmute Microsoft Teams, using a spare mouse button, when the application is not focussed.  I am using a Microsoft Sculpt mouse and have a couple spare buttons, particularly the navigate back button, which I would like to reassign to the mute function.\nThe reason I want to do this is because I am typically having a conversation while working in another application and I want to avoid the delay and context switching of having to focus the Teams Application before either clicking on the mute button or using the command+shift+m keyboard shortcut.\nIt's inconvenient enough that I have considered using something like Touch Portal on my phone to create an easy hot button but that application isn't signed.\nMicrosoft does not provide Mac drivers for the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse or Sculpt Ergonomic desktop.\n\nA: here is an API call using graph, that does something like you are asking.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/participant?view=graph-rest-1.0&viewFallbackFrom=graph-rest-v1.0#properties\nThey also have an API call to mute\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/participant-mute?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http\nHowever I don't think you are going to get the feature you want, because when you are using teams, you are not allowed to unmute someone else, and the API has no idea the person you would be trying to unmute, is you.\nOne thing that should be pretty easy, is to mute/unmute the mic at the operating system level. This would work, however your co-workers would not know you are muted.\n\nA: Ok, I got this working with Touch Portal on Windows. I suspect you are on a Mac due to this being Apple exchange, but I used built in Touch Portal features, so hopefully it works for you as well. This is an action to mute at windows level. However when I do this, it also toggles the mute icon in Teams. So on windows anyway, Teams in integrated with the system level mute.

To get accented letters, typically one would type Option + <key> to get the accented version of it, e.g., Option + C to type ç or Option + Shift + C to get Ç.\nHowever, this Option + Shift combination for upper case letters DOES NOT work for some letters, even though the lower case version works just fine.  Also, I can press and hold Shift + <key> to get the accented letter mini menu to appear on top of the typed letter.

The one thing I did not account for is that VirtualBox stopped working.\nI followed the usual advice of using the VirtualBox_Uninstall.tool script to remove any trace of VirtualBox, rebooting, installing the latest stable version from a VirtualBox-6.1.16-140961-OSX.dmg disk image, ... which fails.  The install does not complete. I'm apparently not alone in experiencing this. Afterwards, VirtualBox is present on the file system however. Trying to start it works, although not booting up VMs. This fails with a rather expected\nKernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)\n\nMake sure the kernel module has been loaded successfully.\n\nwhere: suplibOsInit what: 3 VERR_VM_DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED (-1908) - The support driver is not installed. On linux, open returned ENOENT.\n\nerror message. After dismissing it, the VM process crashes (throwing EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)).\nI then tried pretty much everything in the giant thread out it on the VirtualBox forums. Nothing works for me. The test versions also do not work at all, despite completing the installation.\nAll other articles and forum entries as well as Ask Different questions were either dismissed because the author was using a pre-release version of macOS 11 or describe situations that, to the best of my understanding, simply cannot occur on Big Sur. Like manually accepting kernel extensions via System Preferences > Security & Privacy. As far I can gather, kernel extensions are no longer supported in Big Sur, hence the breakage of software that relies on them, like VirtualBox.\nI need VirtualBox for my Vagrant development boxes. For the time being, it means I'm dead in the water, probably having to re-install Catalina from scratch or buy both a VMware and a VMware Vagrant plugin license.\nMaybe someone else has experienced the same issue as I have and can shine some light on the steps taken to get stuff working on Big Sur. This answer did not work as well for me.\nEdit: For the time being, VMware Fusion plus the Vagrant VMware plugin appear to do the job quite nicely. And by purchasing the plugin, I'm actually supporting OSS development of Vagrant. Additionally, VMware appears to be quite a bit more performant compared to VirtualBox. Oh well, I guess that's what you get for running something like macOS as a development machine and update too early. Lesson learned: I'm going to trail macOS releases by a full year from now on.\nEdit 2: VMware Fusion has issues with Vagrant creating private network addresses. This fails with a \"Failed to create new device\" error and Hashicorp support has no idea what may be wrong. However, after a full disk wipe and clean install of Big Sur, suddenly VirtualBox installs just fine and runs as expected — meaning, like before. No issues with private networks as well and no SIP messing around or the like required. Just initiated a refund for the VMware plugin license. It's pretty clear that the OS updater breaks stuff in subtle ways that are hard to troubleshoot. My suggestion to someone in a comparable situation: backup your system, wipe it, make a clean install and rebuild it from scratch (not a Time Machine backup). Now the only issue are random kernel panics on restart, even on the clean install. Oh well...\n\nA: Big Sur user here (11.1), running VirtualBox 6.1.16 and Vagrant 2.2.14. Currently have a VM running, no issues. The major hassles for me came a few OS versions earlier (Catalina), presumably due to tightened macOS security, so may be why it was smooth for me to update to 11.1.\nPer the mentioned thread, did you try this?\n\n*\n\n*go to system preferences > security and privacy\n\n*unlock to make a change\n\n*unblock Oracle (might need a restart)\n\n*Install Virtualbox again\n\n*Linux VM started properly\n\n\nA: Upgraded High Sierra to Big Sur 11.2.3 and encountered same failure. Without research, first updated to latest VirtualBox 6.1.18, then to vagrant 2.2.14, but same issue persisted, and then came across this topic.\nOpened \"System Preferences\" -> \"Security & Privacy\".  Found a message \"System software from developer \"Oracle America, Inc.\" has been updated.\nClicked \"Allow\", then it asked for reboot so rebooted.\nVirtualBox from vagrant then started up without any issue without reinstalling VirtualBox.\n\n\nA: \nAs far I can gather, kernel extensions are no longer supported in Big Sur, hence the breakage of software that relies on them, like VirtualBox.\n\nTo be clear, it is not that they are \"no longer supported\" in Big Sur. It is just that Apple has decided that they want to discourage developers and users from adding kernel extensions to macOS and so have made it harder to use it in Big Sur.\nKernel extensions allow developers a way to directly integrate with, and add features to, macOS and VirtualBox uses this method to add virtualisation feature to the macOS.\nWith macOS Big Sur, usage of third-party kernel extensions is diallowed by default. So before you use any software that needs kernel extensions (like VirtualBox) you need to explicitly instruct macOS to allow them.\nThe way to do this on macOS is to partially disable SIP. (Read more on how to disable SIP only on specific parts of the system.)\nThus, (as Rakib Fiha's answer suggests), even the VirtualBox Mac OS X build instructions advises the same - that you need to disable SIP for kernel extensions to allow macOS to load the VirtualBox kernel extension. And this needs to be done before installing VirtualBox.\nTo do this on macOS Big Sur, boot into Recovery mode, open Terminal and execute the following command:\n$ csrutil enable --without kext\n\n$ spctl kext-consent disable\n\nThen restart and boot normally into macOS and download and install VirtualBox.\n\nA: You just follow this process to get VBox working see source:\nReboot into Recovery Mode, authenticate, open a Terminal session, run the following, and then reboot:\nspctl kext-consent add VB5E2TV963\n\nWhen you log back in, Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy\nClick on Details under \"Some system software requires...\"\nCheck the box next to Oracle America...\nClick OK\nYou will be asked to restart\n\nOnce restarted, your Vbox will be working:\n\nA: Here virtualbox is running on: BigSur 11.2 beta:\n\nI had the exact same issue when I migrated from Catalina to BigSur.

At this stage, attempting to start it will cause a kernel driver (rc=-1908) error.\nIn MacOS System Preferences - Security & Privacy, click the lock (lower left) to fully enable the interface, then an option should appear to allow the Oracle software. (Supposedly this option can only be reached for 30min after the installation; otherwise will need to reinstall.)\nIn Virtual Box, attempting to start the machine, will be asked for an .iso installer boot image. This can be downloaded freely from Microsoft. (Click the folder when prompted, then click add, then navigate to the download..)\nMake sure not to configure the guest box to use too much RAM, otherwise macOS will lock up and become non-responsive.\nNote, an alternative is to use Boot Camp (included with macOS) to dual boot the host machine, likely with superior performance for gaming.\n", "Q: How to capture requests of app on ios I want to see all requests to local network that some app(broadlink E-Control) is doing.

If an iPhone previously had its screen/battery/camera repaired by a third-party but it works fine afterwards, will Apple service the iPhone?\nFor example, let's say that my iPhone battery went bad so I went to a cheaper third-party store to have it replaced (likely with a non-OEM battery). I use it for a few months but it degrades much faster than an OEM battery. Can I take it to Apple and pay them the money to replace the battery with their own OEM part?\nI understand a third-party repair will void the warranty on an iPhone, but I have not been able to find any definite information about whether they void all future repairs/servicing from Apple.\nThe reason I am asking about this is because of an article on the Verge published in March 2019 linked here. Here are some snippets (my emphasis added):\n\niPhones with third-party batteries are now eligible to be repaired at Genius Bars and Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), according to internal Apple documents reportedly obtained by MacRumors and French outlet iGen. Before, Apple policies stated that customers were ineligible to receive any kind of repair service if their iPhones were previously repaired with any non-original, third-party components, meaning you’d be taking a big risk by replacing an iPhone battery yourself.\n\n\nBatteries are the latest third-party components to be accepted by Apple’s rigid repair policy, as the company changed its policy to accept iPhones with third-party displays for repair in 2017.\n\nSo this article suggests (without a source) that only recently an iPhone with a third-party battery or screen replacement is eligible for repairs. Is there any more information, perhaps directly from Apple, about what is allowed for servicing?\n\nA: Yes - Apple generally services any device or explains why they cannot after it’s entered in for service.\nThe reasons to deny service are usually relayed to damage or failed service not that a qualified or unqualified person did good or proper service previously on the phone.  One typical issue is when aftermarket parts are used, that generally is something you have to fix outside of warranty before Apple will service - but again, it depends highly on the work being done and if Apple expects to rework the parts in your device or the unauthorized repair materially makes Apple’s job harder or more expensive.\n\nApple has always reserved the right to only cover under warranty (and their service plans like AppleCare) authorized repairs that use certified parts. I’ve seen this language in the legal agreements since the 90s and can’t source earlier documents to see when it actually started.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/\n\n1.11.6 Disclosure of Unauthorized Modifications. During the service ordering process, you must notify Apple of any unauthorized modifications, or any repairs or replacements not performed by Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”), that have been made to your product. Apple will not be responsible for any damage to the product that occurs during the repair process that is a result of any unauthorized modifications or repairs or replacements not performed by Apple or an AASP. If damage results, Apple will seek your authorization for any additional costs for completing service even if the product is covered by warranty or an AppleCare service plan. If you decline authorization, Apple may return your product unrepaired in the damaged condition without any responsibility.\n\nIn practice, the worst that happens is you get a call mid-repair and an explanation why the repair will cost more or why the repair isn’t being completed. So yes, Apple typically does all it can to cover a repair even when it has the clear right to not perform service in my experience.\nWith batteries and hardware, as long as there’s not case or connector damage and the part is scrapped, there’s little benefit to Apple not doing the repair. The technician is on the hook for a limited warranty so the only time when Apple or a certified center rejects a repair is when they can’t guarantee the repair for the time Apple specifies or they can’t complete the repair with the parts budgeted for that repair. Also, if Apple subsidizes the cost of the repair parts since they can rework a portion of the failed ones and then certify them for repair use later, it seems fair to not pass that cost savings off to someone that isn’t returning same quality parts back into the “repair pool”. The source of those quotes is likely service bulletins that leaked on how Apple trains their staff to qualify repairs and label parts for return and inspection. Apple engineers analyze all manner of failed parts and if the technicians send back non OEM parts, that wastes time and resources on the quality team and also needs to be tracked for failure rate analysis.\nBut the official stance is they may not service any gear they can’t verify has correct parts and a properly documented service history if the original parts are missing when the repair starts. Apple doesn’t usually grill customers “Did you have any unauthorized repairs?” but it’s in the terms you sign before you hand off your gear if you read all the words.\n\nA: \"let's say that my iPhone battery went bad so I went to a cheaper third-party store to have it replaced (likely with a non-OEM battery).\"\nEven if you replace it with an OEM battery, your iPhone will not fully accept it. Many users are like \"FU Apple\" about that, for that sounds like Apple forces you to bring your iPhone to their authorized service providers. So, for sure Apple will be happy to service your iPhone, the discussion is more about why  \"the latest version of iOS displays a new \"Service\" battery message in the Settings menu that suggests the cell has an undiagnosed problem, disallowing users from accessing Battery Health information.\" https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/08/08/new-service-battery-message-in-ios-pushes-consumers-toward-official-replacement\nI like the following opinion in that regard: \"I think that it is somewhat misleading for the iOS to say Battery Health – Service. Instead, it is better to say something like Unverified, or Third-party, or even just a question mark. It is misleading to say Service for any battery and compatibility.\" https://appleworld.today/2020/12/19/opinion-getting-back-to-the-iphone-battery-service-issue/\nAgain, this implies Apple will be just happy to get your iPhone fixed, for they are now facing lots of criticism by their users due to their policies.\n", "Q: in the callhistory.storedata database, table - zcallrecord, what are the values for zdisconnected_cause and what do they mean?

After upgrading to Big Sur from Catalina, I remarked my fan was running continuously. Opening Activity Monitor I remarked that \"com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore.speechrecognitiond\" was chewing through CPU at 37.3%.\nLooking a likely candidate, and just being a bit anal about having a microphone in an always-on state, I wanted to knock that nonsense on the head.\nThere was a microphone graphic on my screen which presented the option to \"Sleep\" which when clicked then presented the option to toggle the mic to \"Wake Up\". Clicking this did nothing: Speech Recognition nonetheless kept the fan humming and chomping through CPU cycles.\n\nAfter toggling every application's access to the microphone to deny access, \"com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore.speechrecognitiond\" was still happily chomping through CPU.\nWhere is a setting to toggle the microphone off at OS level in Big Sur?!?!?!\n\nA: This drove me bananas. Should be straightforward, but it isn't.\nGoogling returned lots of results for disabling the microphone on an application-specific basis in Big Sur, but absolutely oogatz on a global toggle to kill the microphone on a GLOBAL basis to both stop Speech Recognition from chewing up my CPU as well as shut down an open mic.\nI next visited \"System Preferences\" > \"Sound\" which seemed a logical place to tweak such a toggle. Nope.\nIt's actually buried in \"System Preferences\" > \"Accessibility\". No, I'm not joking; that's where it lives. Untick \"Enable Voice Control\" and if you go back to Activity Monitor, you'll see you get your CPU back and the microphone should be down.\n\nAnother thing that really irks me is that Apple is supposed to telling you when something is accessing the microphone or camera, but you don't get a warning when Apple itself is triggering the microphone. ANYTHING that accesses the microphone or camera SHOULD trigger a warning light IMHO.\n", "Q: external keyboard: cannot use f1,f2 etc. keys without pressing fn key I am using mba with high sierra and an external keyboard JETech 2156. The problem is I do not want to use fn key, for example F8 key has play or pause option. I have to press fn+f8 to pause or play. I simply want to press f8 rather than pressing fn key every time.\nIn the keyboard settings the box next to use f1, f2 as std function keys is unchecked. It does not matter if this box is checked or unchecked. In modifier keys I've selected the JETech 2156.\n\nA: Unfortunately trying to fix this problem is as simple as checking a box on macOS. It is simply not something that macOS is capable of modifying—at least without third-party apps.\nOn a very simple level, keyboard work by sending \"keystrokes\" to the operating system that they are connected to. It is the job of the operating system to interpret the meaning of those keystrokes, which is generally does accurately.\nThe way the keyboard that you linked is designed is that it sends out the \"special\" keystrokes by default. For example, instead of sending out the F10 keystroke, it send out a \"mute\" keystroke. The OS interprets this keystoke and carries out the respective action.\nIf you wanted that button to send the actual F10 keystroke, the only way you can do it is by pressing Fn on the keyboard and then that button. Unless there is a specific setting that can be configured on the keyboard itself, there is no way of changing the keystroke that is sent out, and it looks like the keyboard does not support this useful feature.\nSo there is no way to change the actual keystrokes that are sent because the keyboard stubbornly doesn't want to send them. However, you can trick the keyboard. You can tell macOS to interpret the keystroke as something else—for example, you can tell macOS that, if it receives the \"mute\" command from that keyboard, it should interpret that as the F10 key. This is possible through the amazing little Karabiner Elements utility.\nAfter installing Karabiner, open Karabiner EventViewer. Press the key that you want to change (for example the mute button). Click on the button that appears on the top right which says \"Add mute to Karabiner-Elements.\" Then, change the action to F10. Ensure that the device at the top that is selected is your external keyboard and not \"All Devices\" because you don't want F10 to be triggered every time you use your Mac's keyboard to mute.\nNote: one potential caveat: there are some keys that do not send a keystroke to the OS and thus can't be remapped. One example is the Fn key on external keyboards. Apart from those exceptions (to my knowledge only the Fn key), you should be able to remap just about any other key.\n", "Q: How to sync playlists from old phone to new laptop?

Remove any unwanted languages from the list.\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences: Users and Groups: Login Options. Unlock the preference pane if needed.\n\n\n*Toggle the “Show Input menu in login window” option off and on again. (Toggle it on if it wasn’t already enabled.)\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences: Language and Region: General: Preferred languages.\n\n\n*Temporarily add a second language to the list using the Plus button. You’ll remove it later so just add any language.\n\n\n*Drag the new language to the top of the list.\n\n\n*Click the new Gear button that appeared on the bottom bar when you rearranged the language list, and choose Apply To Login Window. (As shown in the above screenshot.)\n\n\n*Drag your preferred language back to the top of the list again.\n\n\n*Repeat step\n\n\n*Remove the language you temporary added to the list by selecting it and clicking on the Minus button.\n\n\n*Reboot your Mac.\n\nA: If you have FileVault activated and are struggling to set your desired language on the login screen try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off FileVault\n\n*In terminal execute this to copy your keyboard settings to the login screen sudo cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist /Library/Preferences/\n\n*Turn on FileVault again\n\n*Reboot\n\nTested on Big Sur\n", "Q: Partially redeem Apple Gift Card on App Store After using £200 of the value of my Apple Gift Card in the apple retail outlet(physical shop), I now have a balance of £500 of which I'd like to put £100 of that towards my App Store credits so I can buy iCloud storage, apps, etc. Here are my questions:\n\n*\n\n*In the dialog to redeem a gift card on the app store I'm not sure if I can partially redeem just £100. Is this possible? I'm wary of going forward with this in case all £500 is redeemed to the app store, which would be needless.\n\n\n*Is it possible to buy iCloud storage using balance from a Gift Card?\n\nA: *\n\n*You cannot partially redeem using the redeem page you're referring to.

In a way that ... could my email/account/name show up on the screen when new user sets it up ?\nI deleted the device from my iCloud account too. After I erased it.\n\nA: If you did a factory reset (Settings > General > Reset < Erase All Content and Settings) it asked you for your AppleID password at that point, right?\nThat should, while factory resetting, dis-associate your AppleID.  If you're seeing the \"Hello\" welcome initial start-up screen, you should be good.\n\nA: Prior if I recall correctly iOS 9, e.g iOS 7 and 8 you had to sign out, and then wipe all settings as Find my Device was still left active if you don't.\nSince iOS 9 and later Reset all Settings signs you out of iCloud and also asks to disable Find my Device, but you will still see the device on icloud.com web or in your iCloud profile. This does not affect device it self, but it can still use amount of paired devices for Apple Store and Apple Music.\nSo if you want fully remove device from your account, which you sell, just delete it from your Devices in icloud.com\n\n\n", "Q: Is a FaceTime Proxy Possible? I'm wondering if it'd be technically possible to have someone FaceTime a bot and the bot serves as a proxy to FaceTime another number? Similar question with iMessage?\nBy Proxy I also mean calling the end user from a different number than the call came from.\n\nA: It's pretty difficult, if not impossible.  You see, all the communications with Apple are obviously done with secured SSL APIs.   As difficult as it is to impersonate another user to Apple, it's even more difficult to impersonate Apple to the receiving user, Apple controls the whole software stack.\nObviously a nation state attack could conceivable achieve this but this would surely go via hacking the mobile device of the receiving user.\n", "Q: Apple MainStage audio output device changes automatically after some time I am using Apple MainStage 3.5 and I route the Audio Output to a Loopback virtual device.

An iPhone / iPad is configured to use both APs.  Is there a setting to enable the phone to hop to the other AP if its signal is significantly stronger than the current AP?\n\nA: Switching to the strongest signal will automatically happen if the Wifi SSID (the name of the wifi you see in Wifi Settings) of both Wifi signals are the same. (So in your case, both the AP should be named either Bob or Mary, and be on different Wifi channels so that they don't weaken each others signal).\nIf the SSID are different then it won't work. One possible reason for the lack of this feature is that Wifi consumes a lot of power, and if your device has to always keep scanning for all Wifi signals to determine their strength, the battery will drain faster.\n(Jailbroken devices can have this feature - StrongerFi – Automatically switch to the strongest WiFi signal - though I wouldn't really advise opting for this route.)\nApple support article \"How iOS decides which wireless network to auto-join\" explains how iOS automatically determines the Wifi to connect to, based on your past wifi activity.\n", "Q: How to turn off screen saver for remote desktop sessions in macOS Catalina?

My Macbook (just) qualifies as supported for Big Sur and is running Yosemite 10.10.5 (OK, I'm a little slack with upgrading). I have completed a full backup to external drive.\nThe doc says:\n\nUpgrading from macOS Catalina 10.15 or Mojave 10.14?\nGo to Software Update in System Preferences to find macOS Big Sur.\nClick Upgrade Now and follow the onscreen instructions.\nUpgrading from an older version of macOS?\nIf you’re running any release from macOS 10.13 to 10.9, you can upgrade to macOS Big Sur\nfrom the App Store. If you’re running Mountain Lion 10.8, you will\nneed to upgrade to El Capitan 10.11 first.\n\nShould I upgrade to Catalina (the last 10.x) first, then Big Sur (11.x) or just go straight to Big Sur?\nIs there less risk of screwing up my Macbook going via Catalina, or is the risk the same?\n\nA: The answer used to be to first upgrade to High Sierra. The reason was High Sierra included the firmware upgrade to allow a Mac to boot from APFS volumes. Also, if your Mac boots from a SSD, then the upgrade would convert the boot volume to APFS.\nI can refer to this previous question: Updating to macOS Catalina gets stuck, when trying to update from OS X Mavericks. The jump to Catalina was to far, yet the current macOS Catalina - Technical Specifications state upgrading is possible from \"OS X 10.9 or later\".\nYou have Yosemite and want Big Sur.

I ran into the common issue where Illustrator CS6 was unable to open in newer Mac OS version and asking for Java 6 to be installed.\nWhile I have already installed Java 8, I found this thread where a few answers pointed to the possibility of using Java 8 as long as two empty directories are created: Adobe Illustrator CS6 with Java 8?\nHowever, it appears that most users there are using El Capitan or older versions, and since there are some SIP related operation involved, to be on the cautious side, I want to know if anyone tried/knew the same solution proposed in the above thread would work for Mojave (10.14.6)? Would this cause any issue with future updates?\n\nA: The answer given by Zac Jackson still applies to Mojave: you would have to disable SIP in order to create the required folders. Illustrator's reliance on Java is very slight: the main problem is the 'check' at startup.\nArguably, it's easier just to install Java 6 SE anyway. Java 6 doesn't interfere with Java 8, you can have both installed with no problem.\nOnly Illustrator and Dreamweaver need Java: the other CS6 apps do not.\nHowever, as Mojave gets older and older, your best option is to run Creative Suite inside a virtual machine running an older OS, like El Cap, and/or migrate to cheaper, more up-to-date apps, like Affinity Designer, that are just as good, if not better, for many uses.\n", "Q: How do I Propery Configure Display Scaling on macOS (with a 1440p External Display) to Reduce Eye Strain? I have a triple monitor setup, I use it for my gaming computer primarily. This setup until November was 3 1080p 27\" monitors. I use a Dell D6000 Dock to connect my 2018 MacBook Pro (and when WFH in lockdowns my work Mac Mini). I'm back in the home office but the setup has changed since I last used it (which worked perfectly).\nI bought a new 1440p 165Hz beast of a gaming monitor, I've been using it on windows since November with absolutely no issues. All you need to do is whack 1 slider up to set an appropriate display scale and you're done.\nOn Mac I'm having a few more problems getting this display scaling to work properly. I've been getting eye strain this week when my main monitor is set to 1440p, its really bad. If I set the display to 1080p the strain goes but the quality of the image is worse than my side monitors. The side monitors on windows look blurry, when compared to the main and I paid alot of money for my new monitor and I'm very happy with it, so I want to run it at full whack.\nThe Display menu is confusing in my opinion because it displays different scaling options for retina & non retina displays:\nRetina\n\nNon Retina (This is my actual display settings for the monitor in question\n\nI would like to run the display so that the screen scaling matches 1080p, but I want the image to be at the full resolution of my monitor, 1440p. I've had a look into both RDM & SwitchResX but don't really understand what I'm doing.\nRDM\nI don't actually get many options in this program. I get the usual options that are available in display and very few \"Retina\" options.\n\nIf I try to select 1280x720, nothing happens at all. If I select 1280x800 (16:10 so an incorrect aspect). the screen changes and displays a really high quality image with the OS GUI scaled and at a much less eye taxing size.\nSwitchResX\nI've played about with custom resolutions but can't get it to send a 2560x1400 60Hz signal scaled to 1920x1080. If I add a custom resolution it just marks it as invalid, even if I use the preset provided by the program.\nDilema\nI really can't live with the OS GUI scale of native 1440p on macOS. Everything is just that little bit too small and its genuinely causing me physical pain to use my setup which is tried and tested for years (never had ANY issues on the 1080 displays). I'm planning an upgrade of my side monitors to 1440p as-well so I really need to crack this issue before I go and triple my problem... \nI tried things like following this gist to set the screen to 2560x1080, even turning SIP off (which seems scary to me).\nWould these issues be caused by my use of the Dell D6000 Dock? I'm connecting it to my mac via Thunderbolt USB C & I use the provided HDMI 2.0 cable to connect the dock to the monitor. I tested the specific cable with my windows machine and was able to run the panel at 1440p + 165Hz so bandwidth is likely not an issue. My dock supports up to 3 4K displays so again I don't think there are any physical limitations in the way. This is a purely software issue and I've got to say disappointing from apple. Their iOS accessibility is top notch, but their mac accessibility looks to be garbage if this experience is anything to go by! and I'm not alone!\nFor now I'm running the monitor at 1080p, everything looks blurry but at least I'm not going blind....\n\nA: The solution requires SwitchResX and to follow this guide - How to Mimic a 2K Monitor as “Retina Display” in macOS Sierra Using HiDPI. The high level steps:\n\n*\n\n*Install SwitchResX.\n\n*Disable SIP.\n\n*Create a custom 4k resolution (3840 x 2160) in SwitchResX using the Scaled resolution option.\n\n*1920 x 1080 HiDPi becomes available in Current Resolutions of SwitchResX.\n\n*Enable that resolution.\n\nThe image is now going to my monitor at 2560x1440 with the HUD scale of 1920x1080.\n(Thanks to @Tetsujin & @sfxedit I've been able to get the monitor displaying how I wanted.)\n\nEdit* This solution is only valid for intel silicone macs. If you are running Apple silicone SwitchResX will not work and you will need to use a solution such as BetterDisplay(Previously known as BetterDummy), which doesn't require SIP being disabled!\n\n\nA: SwitchResX did not work for me but I found a working solution which does not require to disable SIP.

I already have a script that allows me to stop the Dock process (thereby eliminating the ability to navigate to other applications except the current one), so other application is not a concern. How can I temporarily disable access to view history or protect it with password without having to restart Google Chrome?\n\nA: The easiest way to keep your browser history (and everything else) to yourself is to either enable the Guest account or setup a \"throwaway\" account on your Mac and then use Fast User Switching to change accounts whenever somebody wants to use a browser quickly.\n", "Q: Upgrading SSD in 2015 MacBook Pro I haven't been able to find the solution to my issue anywhere, so here goes:\nI have a 15\" MacBook Pro (mid 2015) and it's at all points a great device, with the only drawback being low storage (I only have the 256GB installed).\nI am aware of OWC's solution and I almost bought a 2TB SSD, but then I remembered that the new macOS runs a bit differently, if I understand this right. I am not sure if the OWC's SSD would be even compatible with Big Sur (I also read somewhere that it's also completely incompatible with Windows 10 already, so no workarounds there?).\nSo, does anyone know how things stand right now with upgrading storage in \"older\" MacBook Pros in 2021?\n\nA: At least one of OWC's 2 TB SSD is compatible with OS 10.13 and later. From the page for the OWC Aura Pro X2 SSD for the 2013-2015 Retina MBP:\n\"Aura Pro X2 is designed for the latest macOS versions (macOS High Sierra 10.13 and later), taking full advantage of the advanced features of APFS including: strong encryption, copy-on-write metadata, space sharing, cloning for files and directories, snapshots, fast directory sizing, atomic safe-save primitives, and improved file system fundamentals.\"\n", "Q: MacBook in bed: M1 Air vs. M1 Pro with fans disabled I work in bed a lot, and I'm undecided between the MacBook M1 Air vs. Pro. I have heard that fans in the bed will cause my MacBook to collect more internal dust. I’m not even sure how to determine if my bed has a lot of dust compared to other offices.\nHow can I research if having a fan/blower is better or worse in a generic environment?\n\nA: I have worked as a repair technician for several years and the variance in people’s air quality and cleanliness is so much more a factor than whether the Mac has blowers or fans.\nIn general, there’s clear signs of overheating whether the issue is airflow, ambient temperature or lack of convection in the case - so get the Mac you want and need. Get fanless if you prefer quiet and thin or with blowers if you think you’ll do CPU intensive tasks for 15+ minutes and run into a situation where active cooling will delay thermal throttling.\nWhere you use the machine will be unlikely to make or break this buying decision in my experience and you’ll need to manage dust for reasons of screen quality and keyboard function well before you get clogged internals in most cases. You’ll know you need to have a technician service a computer due to dust and that’s not generally a large expense if you must use a computer in an environment that requires cleaning. Your lungs are more a concern to me than the hardware.\nThe only time I would recommend fanless is if there is tobacco smoke and tar in the air - that dramatically accelerates accumulation of fine particulates and can require expensive cleaning in less than a decade of use.\n\nA: I've used an M1 MacBook Air as my sole software development machine for the last month and a half, and I've never felt it get hot, and rarely felt it get warm. Tests by reviewers have shown that it takes a long time to throttle, and when it does get hot enough to throttle, it only loses a small amount of performance, (roughly 20% by my memory).\nNow if you are doing hard core video editing, I'd get the M1 MacBook Pro since long exports could trigger throttling within 3-4 minutes. But for the vast majority of users I can heartily recommend the Air.\nThe only other reason I would not recommend using the Air in bed is that, it's usually too cold! I hate putting it on my bare legs when I'm sitting in bed as it takes a while to warm up. But you can always wear pajamas or put a blanket on your lap if that bothers you;)\n\nA: Think different.\nAfter surgery I needed some recovery time at home, so I had to use a rolling table that cantilevered over my bed for a few weeks. Amazon has a top 100 rolling & over-bed tables list to choose from.\nOne model (#92) actually looks like it can hold an iMac or perhaps even an external monitor and a laptop:\n\nOne added benefit is a real table capable of holding meals, books, and other essentials. Hot liquids are best consumed from a travel mug with an auto-closing top. Trust me.\n\nA: I like IconDaemons approach, but there are many reasons you would not want to do that. Therefore I am going to give an alternative answer.\n\nIn short: I would recommend the MBA over the MBP for several reasons:\n\n*\n\n*no/minimal dust build-up\n\n*lighter\n\n*cheaper\n\n*no moving parts, less risk of hardware failure\n\n*quiet, no fan sound at all\n\n*minimal performance difference\n\n\nThe only real technical difference between the two machines is active cooling with a fan on the MBP compared to the MBA. This difference implies the major differences mentioned above, which are all positive, except for the performance difference. Yet, if you compare the two MacBooks, this difference is very small and only occurs after long and heavy workloads:\nOnly after ~10 minutes under full load the MBA experiences thermal throttling. In my opinion, most users even considering such a laptop do not need the higher performance after long workloads.\nConsidering the battery on the MBA already lasts more than a work-day (and it actually lasts this long, not only in tests), I'd argue you will rarely need the longer battery life on the MBP.\n\nNow lets get to your questions:\n\nIs it true that the Air without fans would be more bed-friendly than the Pro with fans?\n\nIn my opinion: Yes, due to the multiple reasons mentioned above.\n\nIf it is true, would disabling the Pro fans while in bed make it essentially function and relatively painlessly throttle like the Air?\n\nLooking past the technical difficulties and the fact that that's not recommended, the answer would most likely be yes.\n\n*\n\n*However, what do you gain in doing so? This would basically make the MBP a more expensive MBA, yet still with fan intakes allowing dust to get inside.\n\n\nNote: Someone using a laptop in bed is most likely not going to edit videos in FPC X, bounce huge Audio composition in Logic Pro X, test large iOS projects/Apps in Xcode,... and therefore not really gain anything from the MBPs higher performance under sustained load.\n\nI know that the MBP also has slightly better speakers, a slightly brighter display (what do you care in bed?), better mics, but in the end, I don't think these small things are that important.\nHere is a list of videos/articles comparing the two machines:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFLf1Cbckl4\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnU5FDeH0yw\n\n*https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/23/apple-m1-hands-on-comparison-macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-vs-mac-mini/\n\nA: Dust is the least of your concerns. Regardless of laptop make or model, operating a laptop on a bed is generally a bad idea. Bed sheets are very non-conductive and isolate heat very well. I've seen cases of laptops including MacBooks overheat due to operation on beds. This can lead to severe damage to your laptop from burnt components which leads to hardware failure.\nIf you must work in your bed, use a flat surface under the laptop (a board or ideally a folding table). It will dissipate heat a lot faster than a bed sheet.\nWhen your laptop doesn't have to run hot, it will increase the longevity of the device regardless of model.\n\nA: I use my macbook air m1 in bed all the time. In my opinion it is the only premium laptop that can be used in bed safely. It never gets hot at all, because there are no fans and you don't block their airvents. This would be a problem if your laptop had fans, because when you block the airvents with bed sheets, the heat will recirculate back into your laptop and it will get hotter and hotter.\n", "Q: How to print a selection of a PDF document: Safari on Mac using MS Word I’m using Safari on Big Sur, and need to capture a small section of a document to send off to someone.

I have had it with macOS.\nI use a 2014 MacBook Air.\nTo use some apps I need, I had to upgrade to the newest macOS, but this slowed the computer down like crazy.\nOtherwise, I stay with an older version of OS X (Yosemite) which doesn't lag, but is not supported by many apps.\nRight now I just have macOS. I want to get rid of it and use Windows & Ubuntu.\nSo how do I remove mac OS and dual boot Windows and Ubuntu on this thing?\n\nA: You can leave Windows as is and replace macOS with Ubuntu. There will be a conflict between the files in the EFI partition for Windows and the files the Ubuntu installer will place in this partition. One way to avoid this conflict would be to create a second EFI partition when installing Ubuntu. After the installation completes, move the Ubuntu boot files to this new EFI partition.\n", "Q: iMovie doesn't appear to be able to use all the available space on iPad When trying to save a 15-minute movie from iMovie in order to upload it in the YouTube app, I frequently get the message \"Storage Full: There is not enough space left on this device.

Will it provide power to the hub when connected?\n\nA: Don't confuse USB-C the port with USB 3.0 the protocol.  The Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect to USB-C hubs, docks, and devices with a USB-C port and supports the Thunderbolt protocol.  The TB2 to TB3 adapter does not support the USB protocol and does not provide power.\nI've seen people report that a TB3 dock will support USB 3.x (USB 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2) devices when the dock is connected by a TB2 adapter and cable.  The dock must have a USB-C port, a female receptacle, and not a USB-C jack, a male connector, for this to work.  USB 3.x docks and hubs often have a captive cable (cannot be removed without breaking something) with a USB-C jack or a micro-USB-B receptacle.  USB 3.x docks and hubs with USB-C ports exist, but are rare in my experience, and will not work with the Apple TB2 to TB3 adapter.\nIf your MacBook Pro has USB 3.x ports then use them to connect a USB 3.x hub or dock.  If there are no USB 3.x port then you can use a TB2 to USB 3.x adapter to gain those ports, these adapters will have USB-A ports and not USB-C ports.  Adapters to turn USB-A ports to USB-C ports exist but break the USB spec, using them can damage equipment, or simply not work as desired, and so should not be touched.\nThe Apple TB2 to TB3 adapter does not support DisplyPort so if you intend to plug in a USB-C DP display or adapter then you need the right kind of DP cable or dock.  There are TB3 docks that will support DP displays but not necessarily with the TB2 to TB3 adapter.\nThere are USB 3.x docks that will support video out with a DisplayLink chip if there is a desire for video out from the dock.  These are separate video chips from the one in the attached computer which comes with it's own pros and cons.\nI know that's more than you asked for but I've seen questions like this before and I'm anticipating follow-up questions you are likely to have.\n", "Q: Can’t pair Magic Keyboard due to numerical keys not working I bought a iMac 27” off eBay and included in the sale was an Apple trackpad and Magic Keyboard.\nI am trying to pair the keyboard but when the screen asks me to enter the numerical confirmation code, the number keys on the keyboard do not work.\nThe trackpad paired perfectly though.\nI have plugged in a wired USB keyboard and everything works fine there.\nHave I inadvertently activated a keyboard shortcut on the Magic Keyboard and disabled number keys or something?\nCan I hard reset the keyboard back to factory settings?\n\nA: You should able to connect the keyboard to your Mac with a lightning cable.

I run a server farm of Mac minis. For performance and SSD-longevity reasons, I have (≤ Mojave) partitioned the SSD in APFS and mounted the new partition with the noatime option, and confine builds to that partition. Now that Catalina and beyond have the /System/Volumes/Data partition as part of the OS, I am wondering if there is a way to enable the noatime option for that partition without digging into /etc/fstab, i.e. in an Apple-sanctioned way.\n\nA: Yes, I could add the noatime mount option to the /System/Volumes/Data partition in a persistent fashion with a launchd daemon. This worked for me on macOS Catalina, Big Sur and Monterey.\nI created a /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.noatime.plist file with this content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<!-- Install: copy to /Library/LaunchDaemons/, chown root:wheel and chmod 644 -->\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.noatime</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/bin/bash</string>\n      <string>-c</string>\n      <!-- first get the current mount options to see if there are any default options that we missed to provide here -->\n      <!-- as mount overwrites the default options except the ones it reads out from the filesystem table -->\n      <string>mnt=/System/Volumes/Data; mount | grep -F \" $mnt \"; mount -vuwo nobrowse,noatime \"$mnt\"</string>\n    </array>\n    <!-- launchd appends the output to the log file so write it to /tmp that is removed on each reboot -->\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/noatime.log</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/noatime.log</string>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>LaunchOnlyOnce</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou could pick whatever LaunchDaemon name you would like instead of local.noatime that does not exists yet, but I think the Label in the config and the filename (without the .plist extension) must be the same.\nNormally, this LaunchDaemon will start on each boot so it will add the noatime flag after a reboot.\nBut I see that you have a server farm and I guess a reboot for all those machines is not ideal, so you could manually trigger the daemon without a reboot:\nsudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.noatime.plist\n\nIf you check the log file you should see sth like this:\ncat /tmp/noatime.log\n\n/dev/disk3s1 on /System/Volumes/Data (apfs, local, journaled, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk3s1 on /System/Volumes/Data (apfs, local, journaled, noatime, nobrowse)\n\nThe first line contains the original mount options and the second line the new ones. I think its a good idea to keep around the original mount options in case Apple adds some other default options beside nobrowse (the other options are auto-added from the file system table) as I didn't find a way to append the noatime option without removing the previous mount options. With that said use this at your own risk.\n", "Q: Hardware requirements for HomeKit compatibility? I bought some wifi enabled color changing \"smart\" lights that work with the Google Home app and Amazon Alexa but not with Apple HomeKit. As someone who's heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, this came as a disappointment and it made me wonder if it's possible for manufacturers to make their devices compatible simply by pushing a firmware update or if there are specific hardware requirements that have to be met.\n\nA: Manufacturers can add HomeKit support through post-purchase updates but not many have as there are licensing and customer support costs associated with integrating with another smart home ecosystem.\nYou should look into HomeBridge.

I have tried this with the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (A1621) but it appears that the USB-C port on the adapter is only for power delivery. Does anyone have any experience with other USB-C hubs that can do this or is this a limitation of the hardware of the iPad Pro?\n\nA: \nDoes anyone have any experience with other USB-C hubs that can do this or is this a limitation of the hardware of the iPad Pro?\n\nIt's a limitation of the hardware in the iPad Pro because all USB-C ports act this way.  USB is a host/device (or master/slave) protocol and so there needs to be some means to enforce this.  This used to be done with the use of cables that had an \"A\" connector for the host and a \"B\" connector for the device.  USB-C is a dual-role connector and this makes defining the operation of a USB-C hub difficult.  USB-C also allows for \"power only\" ports which complicates this further.\nThe way host/device is enforced with USB-C is by having no hubs.  Connecting a hub to a host is easy since it's going to have only USB-A and a power only USB-C.  Once in a while I will see a hub with two USB-C ports, one for data only and the other for power only, and these tend to confuse or frustrate people should something be plugged into the wrong port.  No damage is done if the two ports are confused, things just won't work.  Without designating which USB-C port serves which role, and labeling them as such, the operation of the hub cannot be defined in a predictable manner.\nIf you do see a hub or dock with more than two USB-C ports then this is violating the USB spec or it is a Thunderbolt dock.  Thunderbolt defines the function of a USB-C hub, but the iPad Pro doesn't support Thunderbolt.  Yet.\n", "Q: Time Machine is recording *diminishing* amounts of bytes Many issues are concerned with insufficient storage for Time Machine's disk. Mine is the opposite, it would seem that available storage is ignored.\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro: 15-inch 2018\n\n*Memory: 16GB 2400MHz DDR4\n\n*MacOS Big Sur Version 11.1\n\n*Time Machine disk: Seagate Backup Plus Drive, 8TB\n\n*Time Machine works correctly. I can explore material back to 2016.\n\n*Encryption: I started it this week. It's at 18%. I recognize that\nit's a slow process.\n\n*Automatic backup is turned off in order not to delay encryption.\n\nYes; backup not an archive -- but I like sometimes to be able to explore ancient material.\nUsing info last night I saw 940,570,304,512 bytes used; call it 940,570 MB. I did a (manual) backup. The amount used diminished to 939,733 MB. A succession of further checks showed 939,800 ... 939,816 ... 939,818 ... so increasing ... 939,906 ... 939,908 MB. I shut the machine down. This morning, upon start-up, that figure is reduced; it's now 939,760.\nIt's as if a limit of 1TB is somehow set -- yet I have an 8TB drive.\n\n*\n\n*Has such a limit been set somewhere?\n\n*If so, where?\n\n*How can I see it?\n\n*How can I reset it?\n\n\nA: Time Machine compresses backups based on a regular schedule. Ultimately you will end up with weekly backups. This occurs regardless of your free storage space.\nWhen you run out of space, it will start deleting whatever backups you have, oldest first, until you have enough space to complete a new one.\n", "Q: Is it possible to allocate fixed amount of storage to members in an iCloud Family? I want to setup a Family plan on the new Apple One offering. At the time of writing this, Apple includes 200GB storage on the basic family plan, but this is shared among all members of the family. Is there a way to allocate a fixed amount of storage to each user?\nI'd like to set it up and then have my parents use the iCloud storage to backup their iPhones, while my sister and I will probably use it for backups and file storage. The problem is, if I don't allocate each member 50GB, one person will end up using more than their fair share of storage, and you know that will just end in a big fight.\nIf this is not possible, is the alternative possible:\nCan each of the members of the family get their own subscription for a 50GB plan, but then have that billed through to my account as the organizer of the family? That way I'll still pay for their storage, like I offered to do, but the subscription is on their account and therefore no fighting over storage?\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: You cannot allocate storage from the shared pool. However:\nIf each member gets their own 50GB but you have a shared payment method specified (do you pay for applications they purchase? if so then you have this turned on) then all the iCloud Storage bills will go straight to you.\nMy recommendation is to try sharing 200GB first - if you've already tried this (your writing seems to indicate you haven't) or if it immediately fails then you could split it up - but you may be overestimating how much any individual person's storage will grow based on what's available.\n", "Q: Can you batch rename files if they contain certain criteria? I have a list of filenames containing country codes, for example:\nFile1_BG.srt\nFile2_CS.srt\n\nI'm looking to rename them based on the country code to:\nFile1_BG.srt becomes Facebook.BG_bg.srt\nFile1_CS.srt becomes Facebook.CS_bg.srt\n\n\nA: From the Finder, select all the files you want to rename, and under the file menu select rename. This brings up a pane with options to rename. For your files, you can put .srt in the find box and replace with _bg.srt. Then you can replace 'File1' with 'Facebook'. This will quickly rename the files for you. Looking around the rename panel, under the first pulldown on the left is the option to reformat. This option may come in handy as well.\n\nA: Yes I can. I use hazel app for things like this.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.noodlesoft.com/\nI also know bash and zsh and python, but for quick hits a graphical tool is so much better. Especially with undo if you make a big mistake. If you’re new to scripting be sure you have time machine set up and run before you test a new script to fix things when more files than you expected get renamed in a way you didn’t expect.\n", "Q: Maximizing (not fulll screen) safari window in Bug Sur not working (Option Click Plus) I am using Big Sur. Inside the Messages app when I click the green circle in the upper left hand corner while holding the Option key the green icon will display a black plus (+) sign and the window will maximize to take up the whole screen except the dock and the menu bar. I call this Maximizing the window.\nThis same functionality does not work in Safari. In Safari I use the same key combination and the green circle shows a plus (+) symbol when the mouse hovers over the icon, however when I click the Safari window does not expand all the way. It only uses about 60% of the horizontal area of the screen instead of the full 100% of the horizontal area.\nIs there a way to correct this? It is very annoying to have to manually drag the edges of Safari to fill up the screen.\n\nA: I finally got it to work in Safari. Move the mouse cursor all the way to the corner of the Safari window. The cursor should change to and angled arrow with two ends. If you double click while the cursor is a double ended arrow the screen will expand to one side of the screen depending on which side of the window you are clicking on (left or right). Hold the option key while double clicking the arrow to expand out both sides.\n\nA: If you hover over green circle while not in full screen you should see following options:\n\n'Zoom' is the option which should deliver result you are calling 'Maximizing the window'. These options are also available under 'Window' on Menu bar (by default keyboard shortcuts are for Tile Left/Right, others must be set).\nShortcut for Full screen is ⌃ + ⌘ + F. Using it while in Full screen reverts window back to initial size before going fullscreen.\n", "Q: How to forget Time Machine password from keychain When attaching a Time Machine, I am asked if I want to remember the password in the keychain. If I do that, how can I \"forget\" the password?\n\n\nA: Launch Keychain Access, unlock your keychain, and then delete the entry you don't need. This will cause the keychain to forget that entry.\n", "Q: Why has the basic search function on external drives stopped working for one particular drive? I use several NTFS external disks with my Catalina Mac (for PC file exchanges).\nNone of them are Spotlight-indexed, and that's fine as it is not necessary: macOS has no trouble seaching the disks without Spotlight.\nAll of a sudden one of the external disks stopped being searchable.\nmacOS is unable to find any files.\nOn my other external NTFS disks there is no problem with the macOS search function. (and Spotlight is not enabled there either)\n(Rebuilding the Spotlight index is N/A as Spotlight is not used.)\nI have the feeling something in my macOS is messed up regarding that particular external drive. Pehaps a setting that got corrupted? Is there such a thing as a .plist or so for a drive that can be deleted and recreated?\nWhat could be the cause of the basic search function not working on an external USB drive?\n\nA: OK this is really weird, but it turns out that the cause was the one-character name of the disk...\nIt was named \"Q\", but when i renamed it to \"Q backup\" it was suddenly searchable again.\nDoes not matter wich letter, or even a digit, as soon as I only use one character the disk becomes no longer searchable.\nWhen I give its name 2 or more characters - voilà, searchable again.\n", "Q: Need help adjusting AppleScript automation for converting .pages to .docx? How do I adjust this script to allow me to choose files not in a 'pages only' folder, and instead multiple \"free\" files?\nKeyword here is 'single'. I'm by no means a coding expert but I've learned about automator recently and it's been incredibly useful when converting PNG images to .ICNS\nI was sending a classmate a folder with my notes for a course and I realized he's got a PC and I have a Mac, so I should convert the pages documents to .docx so he can open them. I have many other instances where this is necessary. I did some looking online and I created a quick action, and it works! I've tested it a few times and its almost exactly what I need.\nThe only problem is it only works if all the documents are in a separate folder of only pages documents and I want a way to get around that.

For some reason I no longer hear any new mail notifications when a new message arrives. As near as I can tell I have Mail configured correctly to play a notification for every new message:\n\nSo far, I've tried creating a rule that matched every message and would play a sound, but that didn't help. I've also confirmed that Mail is set to play sounds for its notifications in the Notifications system preferences.\nI later discovered that, in fact, no alert sounds are playing on this system either, and that the issue is not just limited to Mail. As near as I can tell, the Sound Effects section of the Sound system preferences is configured correctly.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open System Preferences > Sound.\n\n*Click the Sound Effects tab.\n\n*Check if Play sound effects through has the right speakers.\n\n*Make sure Alert Volume is not mute.\n\n*Make sure Play user interface sound effects is enabled.\n\n\n\nA: Thanks in part to sfxedit's answer, I discovered that no alert sounds were playing on my system at all. So obviously something was wrong beyond just Mail.\nI use a Behringer UMC1820 USB audio interface with this system, and it seems that something got messed up between it and macOS that caused alert sounds to stop playing, even though all other audio was still working. I managed to fix it by opening up Audio & MIDI Setup, selecting UMC1820 in it, and changing its format to 48,000 Hz and then back to 44,100 Hz again:\n\nI suspect I could have also fixed it by power cycling the UMC1820 or rebooting my system.\nUpdate: This method solved the problem once, but didn't do it a second time. My Mojave system is once again in a state where I can't hear any alert sounds, and power cycling my audio interface, changing its format, or even changing the device that alert sounds play on is not fixing the issue.\n", "Q: Where does OSX store the Desktop layout configuration info? Since early Mac versions, I have been able to rearrange the icons on my desktop. Until I use one of the \"Cleanup\" options, they can be in pretty much random positions, even overlapping each other. The same layout of of file, directory, and app icons appears on all Desktop/Workspaces.\nWhere is that information on icon position stored?\nWhat I would like to try doing is having the Desktop folder actually be a symlink that can be set to point to folders Desktop1, Desktop2, etc. I want to use the Current Key app (free) and it's use of AppleScript functions (https://currentkey.com/room-change-alerts/) to change that symlink on the fly, whenever I change desktops, so that I get a different set of icons for each desktop space that I'm in.\nI would also like to preserve the layout of each set of desktop icons by also swapping the layout file.\nWhere can I find that layout file? (If it's a hiddent file in the Desktop directory then I might be home free.)\nThanks.\n\nA: Mac OS X/macOS stores Finder layout information (including desktop icon placement) within the .DS_Store file that's located inside the current directory.\n", "Q: Apple Silicon: port all Homebrew packages under /usr/local/opt/ to /opt/homebrew I recently purchased a MacBook Pro 13\" with the M1 chip and transferred all my data over using a Time Machine backup.

I am using an online email parser.  This selects specific text from an email and transfers it to an Excel spreadsheet which I shall use in CRM.\nI use Apple Mail and have 7000 emails in an account that I need to send to the parser.  I can do this manually, one-by-one successfully.  I now need to automate this process so it can run overnight.  If I use an Apple Mail rule (forward or redirect) the content of the email is not forwarded in its original form which trips up the parser because it works to a predefined template (it needs to see the same info in the same place each time).\nI'm guessing that the best way to do this then might be to write an Applescript to replicate the manual process but to do it repetitively until the job is done.  Can anyone help me write the script?  Or perhaps let me know if there's a simpler/better way altogether to do this.\nWith kindest regards.  Andrew\n\nA: Not sure why the parser would need an email forwarded to it in order to work.\nIf it can work with .emlx files, you can get them from ~/Library/Mail/V6/<key>/All Mail.inbox/*. Just ensure that all attachments and remote images are loaded. Also, copying all of them to \"On my Mac\" folder will ensure that everything is local, even if the real account is IMAP.\nAlternatively, if the parser works with plain text/ RTF files, you can save an email at a time with File > Save as > RTF/ Plain text/ Raw source.\n", "Q: Capture both audio and video from iOS device via USB in OBS I want to record both screen and audio from iOS device using my MacBook, so I connected the device to my computer using cable. I then opened QuickTime Player, click \"File -> New Movie Recording\", and select the iOS device as video and audio input from the drop down menu next to the record button, and everything works fine.\nI then tried OBS as QuickTime is not very flexible. The video is available in \"video capture device\", but the audio cannot be found anywhere. After a bit research, I found audio input can be enabled using \"Audio MIDI Setup\". However, with OBS opened, the audio device immediately became disabled about a second after I click \"Enable\" in the Audio MIDI Setup. When I close the OBS (or remove the video input from the iOS device), however, the audio input in the MIDI setup works, and I can record audio in OBS via \"audio input capture\".\nThe frustrating thing is that I cannot record both in OBS, it seems like iOS device can only operate in 1 of the 2 modes that provides either video (screen cast) or audio via USB, but not both. But how does QuickTime works? The audio input option from iOS device is in the QuickTime even when the device is not enabled in Audio MIDI Setup (and when enabled, the device is listed twice with slightly different names). This seems like QuickTime use a different mechanism to grab the audio input from iOS device, and I am not aware of any other applications can do this.\nThe workaround I found is to record the main speaker output (using SoundFlower or other similar tools) since QuickTime will output the audio from iOS device to main speaker of my MacBook. However, the setup is quite complicated and not very flexible (included below).\nAny better ways to do this?\n\nAppendix (how to use SoundFlower to workaround this)\n\n*\n\n*First connect the device via cable and open QuickTime. Go to \"File -> New Audio Recording\", and select the device in the drop down menu next to record button (but don't hit record). This will output the audio from device to main speaker.\n\n*Open Audio MIDI Setup, on the lower right corner, click \"+ -> Create Multi-Output Device\", add both SoundFlower and Main Speaker.\n\n*Open \"System Preferences -> Sound\" and set the output to the device just created. You can now record the audio from SoundFlower in OBS.\n\n\nA: \nThe workaround I found is to record the main speaker output (using SoundFlower or other similar tools) since QuickTime will output the audio from iOS device to main speaker of my MacBook.\n\nThis is exactly the right answer.\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur Startup Error - \"Backup and Restore has Encountered a Fatal Error\" I have been getting this error message constantly upon startup:\n\nFrom some quick research, I found out that this might be related to permission issues for Google directory in Application Support.

I need to view a video in \"mp4\" format with an accuracy of minutes, seconds and milliseconds for a specific task - analysis.\nOperating system: macOS Catalina, version: 10.15.7\nAs I understand there are video players with milliseconds display only on windows, on Mac, alternatives and solutions could not be found. Maybe someone came across a similar question and was able to solve it. I have already tried to install the VLC player, but a certain plug-in is needed to open the ability to view in milliseconds, unfortunately I could not install such a plug-in on a Mac.macos\nvideo\nThis error occurs when trying to open the file:\n\n\nThe document \"2020-12-24T09_20_45.375Z_LR_crf_26_deidentified.h.265.mp4\" could not be opened.\nThe file isn't compatible with QuickTime Player.\n\n\nA: If you have homebrew installed, you can install mpv (recommended) or IINA (based on mpv) which displays milliseconds.\nIf you do not have homebrew then you can install it by copying pasting the following in your terminal:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n\nSolution 1:\nInstall mpv with the following command:\nbrew install mpv\n\nmpv player supports url and a wide variety of video formats. That means you can play files locally as well as youtube or any other online video links straight from your terminal.\nAfter installing mpv you can play your video file by going to the terminal and type:\nmpv <Drag the file you want to play from finder and hit enter>\n\nAt the beginning when mpv will open, it will not show you milliseconds. You would have to click on top of the time for it to display milliseconds.\nFor details see: https://mpv.io/ and their git repo: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv\nHere is a screenshot of a non-copyright video playing from youtube with milliseconds displaying at the bottom:\n\nSolution 2: Install iina with the following command:\nbrew install --cask iina\n\nIt should let you install version 1.1.2 which supports this feature.\nYou can choose the timestamp in miliseconds as shown in the following screenshot:\n\n\nA: You could open your video in QuickTime and use the trim view (Cmd+T) to see the milliseconds.\n\nA: The open source app IINA (on GitHub) can show the time in milliseconds.\nYou can install it from its website or with Homebrew: brew install --cask iina.\nTo make it show milliseconds, right-click the current time at the side of the video's scrubbing bar. It will show a \"Precision\" drop down. Select milliseconds to see the timestamp with milliseconds.\n\n\n\nA: You don’t strictly need milliseconds displayed. Your video has a video frame rate: 24, 30, 60, are standards. The standard SMPTE time code gives hour, min, sec, and frames. Divide the frame by the frame rate and that gives you the decimal seconds.\nUnless the video was shot at a high frame rate — which even phones can do nowadays — you won’t actually have millisecond precision. So be careful to not misrepresent the actual precision — make the uncertainty clear.\n", "Q: What is updated by \"a software update is required to connect to \"? I am running macOS 10.14.6 and trying to connect an iPhone running iOS 14.3\nIt shows the message: \"A software update is required to connect to <phone>\" with a link to https://support.apple.com/HT208831\nUnfortunately nothing on that page or the internet in general tells me what the update actually is. Is this a patch, an iTunes update, or a full operating system update? I'm cautious because I can't yet upgrade beyond macOS 10.14 (I have several 32-bit applications which I still need).\nIf I install this update, will it update me to 10.15 / 11?\n\nA: That Apple page reads, in part:\n\nIf your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch has a newer version of iOS than is supported by your Mac, you may see this alert: \"A software update is required to connect to your iOS device. Would you like to download and install this update now?\"\n\n\nClick Install to download and install the software so your Mac can update or sync your iOS device. If you continue to see this alert, make sure that your software on your Mac and iTunes are up-to-date.\n\nAll this does is install software on your Mac which allows macOS (usually an older version) to work with a new version of iOS on your iPhone. As for which specific software is updated (system files and/or iTunes) I do not know, but this update will not update your Mac to a newer version of the operating system.\nI saw this window pop up after I'd updated my iPhone 8 to the latest iOS some weeks ago. My iMac is still running Mojave because of some 32/64 bit app incompatibilities.\n\nA: I have a solution that has actually WORKED.\n2011 MacBook Pro running updated macOS Catalina and an iPhone XR running updated iOS 16.  I was flummoxed by two different flavors of \"a software update is required to connect to your iPhone\" and two different flavors of \"installation failed/cannot install the update file\" along with \"iPhone could not be read\".\nWent through just about every suggestion out there, including installing Xcode, reinstalling iTunes (now just called Music), clearing caches and so forth.\nMY solution? Time and Date.  Yep. I come from starting with 8086 PCs back in the 80s and one key thing that fouled folks like me up with preventing computers actually FUNCTIONING AT ALL - time and date were not properly set to match what the computers was communicating with.  In today's world, time and date issues basically can't really stop a computer device (everything is one, now) from functioning but they can sure throw a wrench in the works and cause lots of headaches.\nI pulled up the time and date in my iPhone, which showed that I had the time set in 24 hour format (being military/fire-rescue in my past life, that's a habit) AND, while \"Set automatically\" was turned on, the Time Zone field just had a SPINNING WHEEL and nothing else.\nI turned the 24-hour format OFF, making the time read in the usual am/pm format, which matched that of my MBP time and date.  And guess what happened?\nThe spinning wheel in the Time Zone field disappeared and was replaced with \"Cupertino\".\nReconnecting the iPhone to my MBP, I DID get the messages that the contents of the phone could not be read and that a software update was needed to connect the iPhone to the manager.  I ran the software install, which actually COMPLETED.  I did get one message about reading the phone, but...dismissing that EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORKING AS IT SHOULD!\nBoiled down: make sure your TIME AND DATE SETTINGS ARE THE SAME between your Mac/MacBook and your devices.\n", "Q: Does taking live photos store a redundant MOV file? On my iPhone, when I backup my photos with photosync, I notice that I get two files for every live photo.  One HEIC and one MOV.  Eg:\nRecents/IMG_0941.HEIC\nRecents/IMG_0941.MOV\nRecents/IMG_0942.HEIC\nRecents/IMG_0942.Mov\n\nWhat's not clear to me is if this is redundant or just a quirk of photosync.\nIs this something the IPhone itself is doing (storing two files on the iphone) or is it likely that photo sync is extracting the MOV file itself?\nAre the two files redundant (can I delete the MOV and get back to it from just the HEIC file?)\n\nA: It is not redundant. Live Photos consist of an high-res image and a video (lower quality than the image).\n\n*\n\n*The HEIC (High Efficiency Image Codec) format is only for images, and it's the one when you actually hit the exposure button.\n\n*The .MOV files are displayed when you long press the photo.\n\nTherefore you can extract the single HEIC image from the MOV file (with lower quality though), while you can't turn the single image into a video. This also means, this is something the iPhone is doing and not photo sync. You would also get those files when using AirDrop for example.\n\nNote: Since the video is lower quality than a single image, changing the key frame must change the quality. However, I could imagine (this is speculation though) that Apple might use some ML/smart algorithm to make the new key frame look better (similar to something like night mode, where a lot of processing happens).\n\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*How does changing key photo in Live photo differ from burst mode?\n\n*Live Photos Called 'Best New Feature,' Composed of Separate JPG and MOV Files\n\n*Apple Live Photo file format on SO\n\n*Live Photo Quality Loss When Changing Key Frame on Apple forums\n\n", "Q: Terminal can't execute files In CWD I stated having this behaviour recently when I tried executing my sh script via sh my_script.sh.\nIt was a simple script with some pyinstaller command.\nNow, the issue that I'm having is that my terminal is not able to access/read file in present directory.\nIf I give ls, I can see the file in the directory, but when I try to run that file, my terminal just shows\nzsh: command not found: hulusubs_dl_osx\nBinary file that I'm trying to run is hulusubs_dl_osx.\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % ls\nBills           \nNotes\nSome Important Things\nhulusubs_dl_osx\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % hulusubs_dl_osx\nzsh: command not found: hulusubs_dl_osx\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % \n\n\nAs you can see that the file hulusubs_dl_osx shows up, but when I try to access it, I get command not found error.\nBut, if I were to provide full path to that file, then terminal is able to run that file\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % ls                                       \nBills           \nNotes\nSome Important Things\nhulusubs_dl_osx\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % hulusubs_dl_osx                          \nzsh: command not found: hulusubs_dl_osx\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % /Users/xonshiz/Downloads/hulusubs_dl_osx --version\n2021.01.08.3\nxonshiz@MacBook-Pro Downloads % \n\nI can access my other installations like Python, brew etc., just fine.

I was able to run the file directly few days ago.\nDoes anyone have any clue what might be happening? What I might've changed that caused this?\nP.S: I'm on Catalina\n\nA: If no path is given (either an absolute or a relative one) the shell searches through the directories listed in $PATH to find commands to execute. If the current directory isn't included there, you need to use a relative path like\n./hulusubs_dl_osx\n\nIn theory you could solve this by adding . to PATH but this is considered bad practice due to the potential security risk (imagine somebody putting a fake ls command in one of your directories).\n", "Q: MacBook Air m1 battery is draining very fast I’ve recently bought 2020 MacBook Air with M1 chip and battery life was incredible over the first couple of days. Then I decided to upgrade macOS to Big Sur 11.0.1 and now I wonder if the battery drain is actually ok.\nI think it drains too fast now, faster than before. Maybe something went wrong during the update. It drained 4% in half an hour and all I was doing is scrolling couple of pages in Safari and some system settings.\nHere are the screenshots:\n\n\n\nA: I have same the drain in my m1 air battery life. I was watching Netflix and my battery drained by 4 percent in half an hour. Earlier I also did a test on my Mac by running zoom and Netflix simultaneously and I got around 14 hrs of battery life which I think is pretty good.\n\nA: Make sure completely quit apps by going into them and pressing Command + Q in your keyboard. Also, restart your MacBook. Plug it in and give it some time to index the drive and finish things. Then shutdown the Mac for 30 minutes and turn it back on. See if it helps.\n", "Q: How to create a bootable USB Drive that will boot on BOTH an Intel Mac and a PC I recently created a bootable USB Thumb Drive containing a Linux Live Distro. I created it on a PC running Windows and tested it successfully on the same PC.\nNow I want to run the same Linux OS on my Mac with an Apple T2 Security Chip, using the same Thumb drive.\nI booted into Recovery mode to allow booting from an external drive.\nAfter restarting and holding the option key, I got a choice of \"Macintosh HD\" or \"EFI Boot\". I chose \"EFI Boot\".\n\nAfter what looked like a Mac loading bar, I finally got the following message: \"Unable to verify startup disk.\"\n\nMy question is: How can I create a bootable Linux USB drive (read-only, I don't need to persist anything to the drive) that will reliably let me boot it both on my Mac and a PC device ? Do I need a specific Disk Format ? Do I need to create it with a specific software?\n\nA: In my Mac's Startup Security Utility, I had selecte \"Allow booting from external media\", but not \"No Security\" from the section above called \"Secure Boot\". Once I had selected \"No Security\" as well, I was able to boot from by thumb drive (FAT32).\n\n", "Q: Make a sound in zsh when a command is not found How can I get zsh to play a sound when the command is not found?\nEx: I have the alias vpn to open my VPN from the terminal (zsh). If sometimes by mistake I type cpn instead of vpn, I get the following output:\nme@iMac ~ % cpn\nzsh: command not found: cpn\n\n\nI know how to play a sound from terminal, in general. How do I integrate it so that there is a sound whenever the command is not found?\nThe specific sound I want to play is available at System Preferences > Sound > Sound Effects > Funky.\n\nA: First, some background on command execution in zsh is helpful:\n\nIf no external command is found but a function command_not_found_handler exists the shell executes this function with all command line arguments. The return status of the function becomes the status of the command. If the function wishes to mimic the behaviour of the shell when the command is not found, it should print the message ‘command not found: cmd’ to standard error and return status 127. Note that the handler is executed in a subshell forked to execute an external command, hence changes to directories, shell parameters, etc. have no effect on the main shell.\n\n\nSo, there are two requirements now:\n\n*\n\n*I need to have a command_not_found_handler defined;\n\n*zsh will have to load this function every time it starts.\n\nThe second point can be taken care of by defining the function in ~/.zshrc file. For the first point I used the following definition:\nfunction command_not_found_handler() {\n        osascript -e beep&echo \"zsh: command not found: $1\"&\n        return 127;\n}\n\n\nBreakdown of the function body:\n\n*\n\n*osascript -e beep&: This command produces the default beep sound of macOS. It's the same sound as the one that plays in System Preferences > Sound > Sound Effects > Funky. The actual location where it is present in macOS is /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff. I have added & at the end of this to execute the sound in parallel. Otherwise the next part of the code will be delayed in execution.\n\n*echo \"zsh: command not found: $1\"&: This is the default action that zsh takes when a bad command is executed. Since the goal is to produce the sound and have the error output on the terminal code, this has to be here. Again, I have added & at the end of this to execute the sound and this message echo in parallel.\n\n*return 127;: This, as mentioned in the quoted text at the top of the answer, is the expected status code when a bad command is executed. While the method worked for me without it, it is a good programming habit to return what is expected.\n\n\nCopy pasting the method in ~/.zshrc file and then sourcing it again makes zsh aware of this function. Now when I call cpn instead of my actual alias vpn, my terminal behaves more consistently with the rest of the macOS and produces the same sound as it does in other GUI interactions, and produces an error message on the terminal.\n\nCredit for this answer goes to @glennjackman's comment.\n", "Q: How to change USB scheme when making bootable Catalina installer? Background: Upgraded to Big Sur on 2020 MacPro (not the one with M1 chip), hate it, trying to revert to Catalina using a USB bootable installer (followed instructions given at the Apple website How to create a bootable installer for macOS)\nWhen I try to install it using the external drive, I get this screen.\n\nSo it seems that my USB has the wrong scheme (should be GUID). I go to Disk Utility and sure enough, it seems like it's Master Boot Record as shown below.\n\nAs per the suggested screen, I try to Erase it, but whenever I try to do that, I get the error shown below.\n\nI'm unsure about how to resolve this and I can't seem to find someone who experienced the same error online. The USB is a brand-new 32GB SanDisk\n\nA: This answer first explains the traditional method of using the Disk Utility to solve the OP's problem, which in this case does not work. Next, the alternative method of using the diskutil command is given. This alternate method did work when tested in a VirtualBox virtual machine on a 2013 iMac.\nThere is no reason the flash drive installer can not use the Master Boot Record Scheme. Your problem is you are trying to install macOS to the flash drive. Normally, you would need to open the Disk Utility after booting to the installer (hold the option key at startup) and erase the internal drive. Afterwards when you return to the point shown in the image, then there should be an icon for the internal drive.\nBelow is an example of the result after highlighting the internal drive and clicking the Erase button at the top of the Disk Utility main window.\n\nNote: The image below shows the Device for the internal drive is disk0. If your Mac shows a different Device, then make the appropriate substitution when entering the diskutil command given below.\n\n\nBefore clicking on the Erase button, you would need to change the Name and Format. Below is an example.\n\nSelecting the Erase button on the pop window should cause the internal drive to be erased. In this case, nothing happens. The solution is to select Cancel, quit the Disk Utility, open a Terminal window and enter the following command.\n\nNote: Here I have assumed the internal drive is disk0. This should be true unless there are additional external drives attached such as a thunderbolt 3 drive.\n\ndisktuil erasedisk apfs \"Macintosh HD\" gpt disk0\n\nAs example is shown below.\n\nWhen finished, quit the Terminal application. When installing Catalina, you should reach a point where you can choose Macintosh HD, as shown below.\n\n\nNote: Erasing the internal drive will delete all data stored on it. Be sure to backup your system first!\nYou could also try using the Disk Utility to add a new volume to the existing container on the internal drive, then choosing to install Catalina to this new volume. This would create a dual boot arrangement that would not erase your existing data.\n\nA: I ran into the same issue and had a different solution. First I'm assuming you have Catalina on a USB boot installer and that you have backed up your files. Now, boot your macbook in recovery mode: Restart and when the Apple logo appears press and hold cmd + r. In the recovery menu select Disk Utility. In this mode you are now free to erase the root disk (since it's not in use). Restart again with USB boot inserted and you'll be asked which disk to install Catalina on.\n", "Q: New Big Sur upgrade. . . downgrade for click drag? When I try to move a window on my MacBook Air (press down with thumb on trackpad and use forefinger to move cursor & whatever object I grabbed) it takes 2 to 5 TIMES(!) for the cursor to actually take hold of the window and move it.  It appears there is NO correlation to exactly where on the upper pane margin I grab.  For weeks now I can't figure out where the \"sweet spot\" is!   It used to be you could place the cursor just about anywhere up there and it grabbed and moved. This is REALLY frustrating.\nWishing I had not upgraded because there is no apparent increase in the OS operation capability that I notice at all.\nMacBook Air(mid-2013)\n\nA: Finally too frustrated to wait further I relented and called Apple.  Apparently this has been a problem in their beta issue of the OS-- 11.1.  Person I spoke with said he experienced it personally but since the latest BETA FOR 11.2 has come out to developers it is gone.   I just need to wait till Apple bumps out their 11.2 OS version.\n", "Q: How to uninstall Windows (bootcamp) bootloader after erasing all disks and restore macOS? I have a Macbook 12 (2017) with Windows 10 in Bootcamp and macOS 11.1.\nI've erased all disks from recovery, re-formatted the disk as HFS+, but when it starts, it tries to boot Windows and stucks on Windows Recovery.\nI've tried to do network recovery, it does the first step correctly, but after reboot tries to boot Windows and stucks in Windows Recovery.\nAfter few tries, it stucks on downloading network recovery with 5010F error code. I've tried to reset NVRAM, seems that it's resetted (I hear two \"booting\" sounds), but after that it stucks on an \"error\" image (stroke circle). If after that I try to boot to network recovery, it still shows 5010F error.\nSo, how to completely erase the disk, including Bootcamp partition, if I can't boot to macOS recovery? Is a USB stick the only solution?\n\nA: You could not have erased all the disks from recovery, otherwise there would be no Window Recovery to boot to. If you used the Disk Utility to erase all disks visible in the Disk Utility, then the result could be the same as the problem you describe in your question.\n\nIn other words, you did not know the Disk Utility does not show all the disks.\n\nThe EFI partition does not appear in the Disk Utility. This partition contains the Windows boot files. If you were to erase Big Sur, then the Mac would look for bootable files and would choose Windows if no other choice was available. This boot would not succeed, if you erased the Windows partition. Reseting NVRAM would not matter. Upon startup, the firmware is going to look for an OS to boot, which apparently in your case is the Windows boot files in the EFI partition.\nYou should be able to boot to macOS Recover over the internet. Occasionally, this can fail do to problems at Apple's end. Using another Mac to make a USB bootable installer is another alternative. Regardless, once booted to an installer, you should be able to use the Disk Utility to erase the internal drive. However, the question \"How to change USB scheme when making bootable Catalina installer?\" demonstrates that the Disk Utility can fail to work properly when Big Sur has been installed. An alternative would be to enter the diskutil command give below in a Terminal window. When this command is executed from macOS Recovery, internal drive of your Mac should be erased.\n\nThe command given below assumes the internal drive is disk0.\n\ndisktuil erasedisk apfs \"Macintosh HD\" gpt disk0\n\n \n\nA: It gets tricky when you're stuck in a situation as you are. It comes down to a bit of luck and a few attempts at things you've already tried.\nMake sure your key commands are definitely right.\n\n*\n\n*First try booting to the standard Recovery mode with Command + R at\nstartup.\n\n*If that doesn't work try Option/Alt + Command + R to boot\nto the Internet Recovery Mode.\n\n*Still nothing? Try shutting completely down then doing PRAM/NVRAM (Command, Option, P, R for 2 chimes)\n\n*Try holding the Option key at startup after a complete shutdown in order to see what options to boot from come up.\n\n*If you somehow manage to boot to a recovery option of some sort, go back to Disk Utility and click View near the top of the window and \"Show All Devices.\" From there you can choose the parent drive (Apple SSD for example) and erase the whole partition set altogether -- not just each volume.\n\n*Finally, booting from a USB volume is probably your only option if none of the above is possible. I've had several situations where the system will not reliably erase itself without booting from something else - even via the Internet Recovery Mode.\n\n", "Q: Stolen iPhone + iMessages on MacBook My iPhone was stolen and I have filed a claim to get a new one. When I receive it the old one, wherever it is, will be deactivated. I have my messages synched onto my Macbook pro also, I have photos and some saved voicemails there that I don't want to lose, will all of my messages also be deleted or will they be alright?\n\nA: When you wipe an iPhone via the Find My.. app or website it will only erase the iPhone itself. Any data you've synched to the cloud will still remain on the cloud.\nRegarding photos and saved voicemails, as long as your iCloud backups were going ok on the phone you should be able to restore everything as-is back to the new phone.\nPhotos would also already be on your MacBook Pro if you had iCloud Photo Library enabled.\nIf you go to iCloud.com, sign in, then click on the Find iPhone option near the bottom right, you can put the phone into \"Lost Mode\", which would still allow someone to track the phone down. If you haven't done that yet you may want to enable that feature first. Then if you're sure you won't get the phone back you can click Erase iPhone as you had been planning.\n", "Q: How can I scroll using my fingers when my iPad is being used as Sidecar? I can't scroll using finger touches.

Is there something different I should do to make this work with messages app? My OS is BigSur 11.1.\nThanks!\n\nA: Simply putting an Alias to the application in the Library/PDF Services folder (either the User's Library folder or the root level /Library folder) should be sufficient to send the PDF from the print menu's \"Save As PDF\" button to any application.\nThis should have the same effect as opening the document with the app, or dropping it on the app's icon.

The storage space on my Mac was not enough, so I bought 50 GB of iCloud storage. But I don't know how to use it. I still cannot download data on my Mac.\nI am a data scientist and I am working in Jupyter notebook. I need to save my data in iCloud and then load it from there.\n\nA: If you haven't already, first setup iCloud Drive on your macOS.\nOnce iCloud Drive is enabled on your macOS, you can access it using the Finder. You can now copy files to iCloud drive as you usually do with any other folder or drive.\nThe iCloud drive path on macOS is:\n~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/\n\nSo if you create a folder called dataset in iCloud drive, it's path will be\n~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/dataset\n\nYou need to use this as the startup folder for your Jupyter notebook as described here - Access iCloud Drive in Jupyter Notebook.\n\nA: On file level iCloud basically is a syncing solution so you can't use it to extend your local storage into the cloud. You can let macOS manage your local storage by offloading everything on the Desktop and in Documents into iCloud and only download the specific things you need (see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206985 for details).\nIf you need additional local storage and can't offload stuff into iCloud it's better to buy an additional local disk.\n", "Q: Charging problems, MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) c I have the MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) and I've been having weird charging issues (I recently upgraded to macOS Big Sur if thats relevant). When I connect the charger it won't always charge, and when I press the battery symbol it only says \"not charging\". One of the ports never works, but the other works after its been plugged in for a little while.\nThe battery still drains when the charger is connected but not charging.\nI've tried resetting SMC, troubleshooting/diagnostic scan shows nothing wrong, the ports and the charger looks undamaged...\nThe battery works completely fine as far as I know other than this, this is a recent issue.\n\nA: Firstly, make sure that you are using the correct charger, and not a lower-rated charger from a different Mac, such as a MacBook Air. If you have another charger, or can borrow one from a friend, it's worth checking whether a different charger works correctly or not. (Or alternatively, see if the charger works ok on another Mac.)\nAs this is a recent purchase, you should take it to an Apple Store for investigation. I realise that may be difficult at the moment with Covid-19 restrictions. It's likely to be a hardware problem that can't easily be identified or fixed remotely.

My Sony camcorder is not on the list of camcorders supported by iMovie.  Is there another software I could use to capture my videos?\n\nA: The general consensus is that any operating systems after Mojave break compatibility with Mini DV or they're not as reliable as older versions of Mac OS. LifeFlix is in active development, and it even works with the new M1 chip.\nAlternatively, if you have access to a Mac with Mojave or earlier, or you can boot the Macbook Pro off a portable SSD running Mojave, you can use Apple's AVCVideoCap: https://www.cuttingcords.com/s/AVCVideoCap.zip\n", "Q: Upgrading from sierra to catalina while maintaining dual boot with kali Yesterday I installed Kali linux in macbook air having macos (sierra).today I downloaded Catalina through appstore .

This has always been true to the best of my knowledge as a Mac user and applies to whether you are using:\ncsrutil enable/disable  csrutil authenticated-root disable/enable\nhowever if my read of the user's issue is correct, this was done in recovery mode and still generated the \"Operation not permitted\" error.\nTo anyone reading this and facing a similar issue, my suggestion would be to mount the drive as root from single user mode with full read & write privileges and copy the kernel.development file into the intended directory manually.\nYou might also be able to gain access while in macOS either through Target Disk Mode from another Mac or using the \"Get Info\" command in Finder of the Mac you are using to edit your privileges and take ownership of the drive as a system administrator and then paste the file directly.

For more info, look at man grep\nSave the script find.sh in your working directory.\nYou can test it by:\nbash find.sh\n\nNow, you can call find.sh from your AppleScript like this:\ntry\n  do shell script \"bash /path-to/find.sh\"\non error\n  display dialog \"no word found\"\nend try\n\nIt is needed to satisfy the sanity check by yourself, by making sure that you pass the correct filename and filepath (bar in our case) in your script.\nSolution 2 Putting the search keyword and filepath inside your AppleScript.\nIf we can guarantee the sanity check of correct filepath, the shell script can be simplified further, especially if you want to put your search keyword and filepath in your AppleScript instead.\nAfter simplification, find.sh will look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ngrep \"$@\"\n\nSave the script find.sh in your working directory.\nYou can test it by:\nbash find.sh \"foo\" \"bar\"\n\nAnd your AppleScript will look something like this:\ntry\n  do shell script \"bash /path-to/find.sh -w 'foo' 'bar'\"\non error\n  display dialog \"no word found\"\nend try\n\n\nA: Using a system grep is almost always going to be the fastest way to go, but if you want a pure AppleScript way to handle it, it's not hard:\non grep(myString, myFile)\n    set fileHandle to open for access file myFile\n    set theWords to words of (read fileHandle)\n    close access fileHandle\n    \n    set matchCount to 0\n    repeat with myWord in theWords\n        if text of myWord is myString then set matchCount to matchCount + 1\n    end repeat\n    \n    if (matchCount) > 0 then\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end if\nend grep\n\non run {}\n    if grep(\"Overflow\", \"Users:jim:log.txt\") then\n        display dialog \"Found it!\"\n    end if\nend run\n\nYou could be a lot more efficient about this too, including breaking out of the repeat loop after finding the first match.

But for now based on the kind of work I do and my monitor setup (the 2 Dells and the iMac), I'm wondering if the Mini's onboard graphics can handle it alone.\nIf anyone has any insight or personal opinion they'd care to share, I'd love to hear it. Also, if there are any other potential issues beyond having to get adapters for TB2 and HDMI that I've missed, please feel free to point them out. Thanks!\nPS - forgot to add that I've read about Bluetooth issues with the Mini as well. My desk is wood (not metal) and I use a 2nd Gen Magic Mouse & Keyboard as well as a FitBit (and I don't NEED to connect the fitbit. i can do that on my MBP if necessary) - will I encounter any issues with the connection to keyboard and mouse randomly dropping?\n\nA: I have the middle i5 6-core Mini, and using InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Logic, Dorico and other 'pro' apps, I haven't even comes close to maxing it out. I've even had Handbrake running in the background comfortably.\nThe on-board SSD is crazy fast. I'd get more RAM for it, though. I have 32GB, which again never gets entirely used, even with loads of caching.\nYes, the Intel graphics units may not be as good as dedicated cards, but they're  good enough for most uses, unless you're doing 3D rendering or high-end gaming. Multiple Photoshop effects layers are not a problem.\n\nA: We run the i7 2018 Macs mini (and newer) in full design production. No issues with color calibration, all the Adobe apps, touch pads, web and teleconference apps. They are workhorses and unless you want to dip your toes in Apple Silicon, a 2018 or newer mini is a workhorse of a Mac. Nothing in your requirements are deal breakers and anyone could slow down even an iMac Pro and Mac Pro hitting it with some of your requirements. The Bluetooth stack is as reliable and prone to interference all other new Macs have in our experience.\nIn practice the i3/i5 are hard to tell from the i7 even though specific things benchmark faster. Most of the time people are slow due to network and humans, not waiting on a build or render. We rarely spec eGPU for this reason as well - they work for specific renders and most people can’t put them to work and the investment is better on training or software than GPU.\nIf you can buy at a discount, any 2018 or newer Intel Mac is a very major upgrade from what you have. I just wonder if you should commit to M1 CPU and Apple Silicon if you’re going to keep this for a decade as well. I suppose you need to balance exactly which software is going to hit your GPU and forecast their investment for however long you run this new Mac.\n", "Q: After updating the emoji font in an older macOS, is there a way to visually find and insert newer emoji that the system emoji picker doesn't support? I just updated the emoji font on my macOS 10.14.6 system using the method detailed in this answer.\nThis seems to have worked great in that I can now view newer emojis that people send me, or that appear on web pages. However, the emoji picker in Mojave doesn't support these emoji, leaving me with no good way to type them, other than finding them in an existing document somewhere and using copy/paste.\nIs there a way to update the emoji picker to include these new emoji? Or perhaps use an alternative emoji picker?\n(I'm aware I could use text replacements in System Preferences / Keyboard / Text to type the emoji, but I strongly prefer to be able to find emoji visually, hence the specific wording in my question.)\n\nA: All Emoji should show up when you use the expanded version of the Character Viewer. If you don't see Emoji on the list at the left, click on the gear wheel and then Customize to add it. You may also need to add the Unicode category and go to the range where the new Emoji are located (probably 1f300-1f900).\n\n", "Q: Phone calls immediately hang up - unless headphones are connected Since updating to iOS 14.3 on my iPhone 7, incoming and outgoing phone calls immediately hang up with the error message below unless I have any Bluetooth headset connected.\n\nEverything works fine with a headset, though. As doing phone calls is kind of an important functionality in an um... phone,  I would love to be able to restore the phone call feature.\nWhat would be steps to try to fix this problem?\n\nA: As a (former) iPhone 7 user with a similar problem, I presume you are also unable to record voice memos or audio in your videos. If so, I am afraid it is a common problem having to do with the sound card of your iPhone 7: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/apple-iphone-7-owners-report-sound-issue-011519.html Apple has previously offered cheap(er) repairs for this issue, but I am unaware if this is still the case. Be sure to contact your local Apple dealer to see if this is the case.\nOtherwise, there are second-party shops which should be able to perform this repair. Your iPhone is most likely already out of warranty so there should not be significant issues with future repairs. However, Apple has previously said they will not repair items repaired outside of official Apple shops, so it might be wise to do some further research and decide if you are willing to take the risk.\n", "Q: How to quickly rename files on NAS I have recently added a Qnap (Linux) NAS to my Mac OS environment, as the main file server.\nI realized many of the Mac OS files have / characters, that do not behave well in Linux, as they disappear when seen from Macs (they actually are being renamed in Linux and becoming invisible from the Macs... dunno why).\nExample: a file named image/b.jpg should be renamed as image_b.jpg to avoid problems on the Qnap Linux NAS.\nAnyway, I'd like to build a script from Mac OS Terminal to access the Linux NAS and perform a \"search and change\" of the / character to something else like: _.\nI have begun by writing this:\nssh admin@192.168.2.2\nfor f in $(find /share/Public/ -name \"*:*\"); do mv $f ${f/:/_}; done\n\nI can log on the remote NAS, but seems not to work... I am not a tech guy, and tried to collect some code samples from the internet.\nWhat are options to automate or script file renames for a NAS share?\n\nA: Running for over the results of a find is not recommended, it will break on filenames with spaces, newlines etc.\nYou can use the following instead once you are logged into your NAS:\nfind /share/Public/ -depth -name '*:*' -exec sh -c 'mv -- \"$1\" \"${1//:/_}\"' _ {} \\;\n\nTo be on the save side, run\nfind /share/Public/ -depth -name '*:*' -exec sh -c 'echo mv -- \"$1\" \"${1//:/_}\"' _ {} \\;\n\nand check the output for anything unexpected.\nPS: The duplicated // in ${1//:/_} is intentional to ensure that all occurrences of : are replaced.\n\nA: Apparently, you can do this right from the Finder.\nYou can also use Automator to do so.\nIf that's not your thing, there are a few different tools that are available (yes, I'm aware you can write a *NIX script to do so).

I tried the answer from Gilby, but wasn’t able to get fdautil to work after downloading and installing it via the LaunchControl trial version.\nIf it had worked, it seems it would have done so by granting LaunchControl’s fdautil utility full disk access, which would then use those permissions somehow to execute my netspeed script (without passing those permissions to /bin/bash?).\nMethod 1: AppleScript wrapper\nI created Users/myself/Documents/bin/iperf/netspeed.scpt, which has the following:\ndo shell script \"/Users/myself/Documents/bin/iperf/netspeed\"\n\nI then updated the ProgramArguments entry in the launchd plist to:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n    <string>/Users/myself/Documents/bin/iperf/netspeed.scpt</string>\n</array>\n\nFinally, in System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Files and Folders I was able to grant access for Users/myself/Documents to /usr/bin/osascript, and successfully launch the daemon.\nMethod 2: Put script in location with less security\nAs @user3439894 pointed out, since the main reason it was difficult to execute netspeed in the first place was that I had it in ~myself/Documents.../, which has elevated permissions requirements, I can also just put it in a location with less security.\nI followed the suggestion to try /Users/Shared/.../netspeed and it indeed worked with my original script and plist contents! To be clear, the ProgramArguments would now be:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/Users/Shared/.../netspeed</string>\n</array>\n\n\nA: The program you want to run is bash, so the program arguments should be:\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/bash</string>\n        <string>/Users/myself/Documents/bin/iperf/netspeed</string>\n    </array>\n\nBut I suspect that you may still get sandbox errors.  To avoid this use the fdautil command which is part of Launch Control.  Then you use:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/usr/local/bin/fdautil</string>\n    <string>exec</string>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>/Users/myself/Documents/bin/iperf/netspeed</string>\n</array>\n\nThis is the mechanism I have used to launch a python script (with the obvious difference).\nThis answer maybe incomplete, but see how you go.\n", "Q: Can an administrator access the iCloud Drive of another user on MacOS? I use a Macbook provided by my employer. I'm not the administrator on the machine, I use another user account.\nIf I connect to my iCloud account and enable iCloud Drive, can the administrator access the files on my iCloud Drive or the iCloud Drive is encrypted?\nThanks\n\nA: The administrator can change your Mac password, login as you and so gain access to your iCloud Drive.  And also gain access to everything controlled by your username - for example, your Keychain.\nThe only mitigation is that the administrator can't change the password back, so you might become suspicious when your login fails.\nAlso, an administrator is able (without your login details) to look at any file on the computer - that would include any iCloud Drive files cached on your computer.\nI don't know the law in your country, but where I am an employer is entitled to access anything on a computer owned by the employer (subject to any other agreement between employee and employer).\nAdvice: Don't keep personal information on an employer provided and controlled computer.\n", "Q: Did I accidently sync my iPhone with a work computer?

Also under my iCloud settings, safari is turned off.\n\nA: Approving a \"Trust this computer\" request enables basic communication between the phone and a computer, it doesn't transfer data per se. Basically it ensures that others can't just take your phone, connect it to their computer and transfer all your data without you knowing.\nWith Windows you will probably see your phone somewhere in Explorer afterwards, mainly the photos should be accessible.

They generally just use an iPad now for all of their internetting/computing needs, however they have an abundance of files on their Mini that they want to keep, mainly photos.\nI have suggested using cloud storage for it all, but they don't want to do that as they don't want to pay the fee they would need to for the amount of files they have. Also being old, they don't want all their files on the cloud and educating them otherwise is futile.\nI have since moved all their files to my more recent iMac for the time being until I can sort something more permanent for them.\nI'm looking for a physical storage device that can plug into both my iMac so I can transfer the files to it, and then plug into my grandparent's iPad, so they can view/open their files (photos and word docs occasional audio file) on their iPad.\nI recently bought this: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08G8HTR8T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and they insist you download an App, called \"CooDisk\" which looked like a piece of rubbish! -- also the device didn't work when plugged into the iMac.

That way they can access the files on it through Files on the iPad. You can also access the Mini this way (when you're at their place) and so it's easy all the way around. This approach means you don't even have to buy anything else. Just allow the Mini to be shared across the local network and you're golden.\n\nA: Any USB storage works in the files app now.

I created an encrypted DMG on MacOS and sharing with my team (sharing password separate from DMG).\nMy question is: if this file gets in the wrong hands, can someone figure out the filenames inside the DMG without the password (assuming they can’t guess or crack the very secure password)?\nI tried looking this up but couldn’t find a straightforward answer. When I open the DMG on a Mac it automatically asks for a password and starts verifying/mounting...\nThank you\n\nA: The file names within the DMG are also encrypted, so unless they break the encryption in general, the filenames are protected (i.e. as protected as the file contents).\nA DMG file is essentially just a raw disk image, similar to what you would get if you read out a normal block device (such as a hard drive or SSD) to a character file.\nAn encrypted DMG file is just the encrypted version of that raw disk image with an extra header at the beginning of the file. Note: On very old Mac OS X versions (10.5 and earlier) a slightly different layout were used where the header is at the end of file.\nThe header contains, amongst other things, the so called \"salt\" for key derivation. In simple terms, the salt is combined with the password you enter to decrypt, and run through a key derivation function (PBKDF2) to produce the actual encryption key. The use of this key derivation function makes it harder to brute-force the password, as key derivation is relatively costly in terms of CPU usage.\n", "Q: Framerate in command line usage of Compressor I use Apple compressor from the command line to generate video clips from sequences of images.

Is this a potential way around it?\nOtherwise, is there anything like some kind of virtual environment I can run, that gives some level of access to admin rights?\n\nA: You can give admin access to specific commands using sudo. To do so, log in as an admin user, open Terminal and run EDITOR=nano sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/myconfig (which will create a new file and open in nano). Then add the following line (replace KID with the name of the unix account of your kid, ADMIN with the account name of the user which installed brew)\nKID ALL = (ADMIN) /usr/local/bin/brew\n\nHe should then be able to run brew commands by typing sudo brew ... and entering his password.\nTo allow commands to be run as root (things you already run with sudo even from an admin account) use\nKID ALL = /path/to/command\n\n(obviuosly this has some risks).\n", "Q: How do I make a command run automatically when I open a new terminal window?

So in particular I can't easily convert these slides to Powerpoint.\nIn Preview, I can annotate the document but only when it's not in Presentation mode. I also can convert them to PDF, though - that’s a bit of a hassle.\nIs there a good way to annotate slides during a presentation for either a Keynote or PDF presentation?\n\nA: As an alternative, if you have an iOS device, it can be used as a remote to highlight and mark up slides during presentation.\nFrom the Apple Docs:\n\nIf you’re using Keynote Remote to control a presentation from iPhone or iPad, you can draw on your device and have your drawing appear on the device that’s playing your presentation. This feature is useful, for example, if you want to emphasize a particular item on your slide—you can underline or circle the item for your audience.\n\n\n\nA: Preview has a sketch function that you can use to “write” after a fashion.\nI don’t possess a wacom graphics tablet so no idea how it would perform with that.\n\nA: Présentation.app and SlidePilot support live annotations that don't change the PDF.\n\nA: Presentify, i believe allows what you want and works with Keynote.

I want to set that by default an application I open (specifically Preview) will be opened in maximum window size.\nNote that I do not want it to be in full screen. I want the window to take the maximum size - leaving room for the top-bar and the dock.\n\nA: As Preview (and or macOS) does not have a preference setting that always opens windows of an application in full desktop (not to be confused with full screen), here is an alternate answer that provides for a keyboard shortcut in Preview to resize the frontmost window in Preview.\nThis uses no third-party anything and can be done using macOS default applications and some AppleScript code without having to mess with System Integrity Protection.\nCreate an Automator Service/Quick Action with settings as shown in the image further below.\nAdd a Run AppleScript action replacing the default code with the following example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Finder\" to ¬\n    set {missing value, missing value, ¬\n        desktopWidth, desktopHeight} to ¬\n        the bounds of window of desktop\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"Finder\" to ¬\n        set {missing value, menubarHeight} to ¬\n            the size of menu bar 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"Dock\" to ¬\n        set {missing value, dockHeight} to ¬\n            the size of list 1\n\ntell application \"Preview\" to ¬\n    if (exists front window) then ¬\n        set bounds of front window to ¬\n            {0, menubarHeight + 1, desktopWidth, ¬\n                desktopHeight - dockHeight}\n\nAssign it a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nI used ⌥⌘F as it is not currently assigned in Preview.\n\nTesting in macOS Catalina, the first time I used it I had to click the OK button on the message box shown below.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code shown above assumes the Dock is always visible and additional coding is required if the Dock is hidden.\nIf you are one that likes to have the Dock hidden, then use the following example AppleScript code instead of the previous example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Finder\" to ¬\n    set {missing value, missing value, ¬\n        desktopWidth, desktopHeight} to ¬\n        the bounds of window of desktop\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"Finder\" to ¬\n        set {missing value, menubarHeight} to ¬\n            the size of menu bar 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"Dock\" to ¬\n        set {missing value, dockHeight} to ¬\n            the size of list 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set dockIsHidden to ¬\n        autohide of dock preferences\n\nif dockIsHidden then\n    set windowHeight to desktopHeight\nelse\n    set windowHeight to desktopHeight - dockHeight\nend if\n\ntell application \"Preview\" to ¬\n    if (exists front window) then ¬\n        set bounds of front window to ¬\n            {0, menubarHeight + 1, ¬\n                desktopWidth, windowHeight}\n\n\nIf by chance you want this to act on all windows in Preview then change the tell application \"Preview\" command as the last command in the code to the following example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Preview\" to ¬\n    if (exists windows) then ¬\n        set bounds of windows to ¬\n            {0, menubarHeight + 1, ¬\n                desktopWidth, windowHeight} \n\n\nA: Solution 1:\nHere is one solution to this, which is using a tiling window manager called yabai.\nLook at their git repo at: https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai\nNote: It requires some advance settings to be configured in SIP and requires yabai to be installed with scripting addition.\nIf you do not want to mess around with System Integrity Protection, then see Solution 2 instead.\nPrerequisite\n\n*\n\n*Homebrew\n\n*SIP configuration\n\n\nSystem Integrity Protection needs to be (partially) disabled for yabai\nto inject a scripting addition into Dock.app for controlling windows\nwith functions that require elevated privileges. This enables control\nof the window server, which is the sole owner of all window\nconnections, and enables additional features of yabai. If you are\nrunning on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, you can reenable SIP after the\nscripting addition has been installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Mission Control preferences pane in System Preferences, the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\" must be enabled.\n\n*In the Mission Control preferences pane in System Preferences, the setting \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably.\n\nMore details at: https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai\nHomebrew\nInstall homebrew if you do not have it already by copying and pasting the following in your terminal.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nSIP configuration\nBoot in recovery mode and execute the following in the terminal:\ncsrutil enable --without debug --without fs\n# after executing the above reboot\nreboot\n\nInstall yabai with scripting addition\nInstall by:\nbrew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai\n# install the scripting addition\nsudo yabai --install-sa\n\n# if macOS Big Sur, load the scripting addition manually; follow instructions below to automate on startup\nsudo yabai --load-sa\n\nFor details see their official installation guide here\nStart yabai\n# start yabai\nbrew services start yabai\n\nNow, when you open an app in an empty window, it will always open with maximum window size. However, if there are two apps in one window, each will take half of the window, so on and so forth. If you want one specific app to be with maximum size, I recommend using Command ⌘ + H to hide those apps, allowing your intended app to take maximum size automatically. To navigate the hidden apps use Command ⌘ + TAB\nIf you want to stop yabai, stop it by:\nbrew services stop yabai\n\nSolution 2:\nUse keyboard-centric apps like spectacle, skhd rectangle etc to resize apps by using keyboard shortcuts instead.\nSpectacle (easiest): brew install --cask spectacle\nrectangle (easiest): brew install --cask rectangle\nskhd (works well with yabai): brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd && brew services start skhd\n", "Q: How to sort photos inside a shared album in the Photos app in macOS, iOS, or iPadOS?

It's slow, and I've found for some reason dot1x never actually establishes properly for some types of Wi-Fi networks in my home. The solution: Create an AppleScript to simulate mouse clicks on the menubar to change between Wi-Fi networks.\nWhy is networksetup so slow compared to manually changing Wi-Fi networks?\nThe below script has worked fine for me until Big Sur:\nuse application \"System Events\"\n\nproperty process : a reference to application process \"SystemUIServer\"\nproperty menu bar : a reference to menu bar 1 of my process\nproperty menu bar item : a reference to (menu bar items of my menu bar ¬\n    where the description contains \"Wi-Fi\")\nproperty menu : a reference to menu 1 of my menu bar item\nproperty menu item : a reference to menu items of my menu\n\n\nto joinNetwork given name:ssid as text\n    local ssid\n    \n    if not (my menu bar item exists) then return false\n    click my menu bar item\n    \n    repeat until my menu exists\n        delay 0.5\n    end repeat\n    \n    set M to a reference to (my menu item where the name contains ssid)\n    \n    repeat 20 times --> 10 seconds @ 0.5s delay\n        if M exists then exit repeat\n        delay 0.5\n    end repeat\n    click M\nend joinNetwork\n\njoinNetwork given name:\"my network ssid\"\n\nThe reason why it broke is that Wi-Fi is no longer technically a direct option under the main menu bar.

I've been reading for hours about people trying to overcome this challenge in Big Sur, for example, to automate a click on specific Bluetooth device, but many AppleScripts people wrote apparently broke in the 11.1 update, and I have no easy starting point here for how to figure out how to accomplish what I am trying to do for Wi-Fi.\nAny help here would be tremendously appreciated.\nSide note: I know the same user also posted a method using AppleScriptObjC, but as people pointed out, it's a huge security risk because you need to put your password somewhere as plaintext. The UI script is therefore the better option in my mind, so I'd like to get it to work again.\n\nA: The technique that I found to work is to interact with the control center dialogs individually.

When using headphones I'll find that during certain videos the content creator decided to put some or all of certain track on the right channel. I know this because I can detect the muffled sound in my right ear but cannot decipher the words.\nPossible solution #1 - Accessibility feature of MacOS which turns stereo into mono - I've tried using this feature, and it does work. However, I lose the pleasing effect of stereo. Even being mostly deaf in one ear, it's still possible for me to enjoy the benefits of stereo music.\nPossible solution #2 - Don't use headphones - Due to my work situation headphones are required\nMy ideal solution would be to just slightly blend the right channel into the left channel.

I have a feeling that FPS in macos is really low, I have checked that with iStats Menu app and I have from 4 to 30 FPS which is really bad result and it can be felt when you are work on this machine. Is there any way to increase FPS or refresh rate?\nI have MacBook Pro 15\" from 2018 2.6GHz + 16GB RAM.\n\n\nA: Firstly refresh rate & FPS are not even slightly related. Refresh rate is a constant (the number of times a second your physical screen changes content), FPS is a variable.\nFinder simply doesn't need high FPS all the time. Why on earth would you need 'gaming-level' response just to look at files on a screen?\nAlso, Finder FPS is responsive to your actions.\nIf you do start dragging things around quickly, the FPS goes up to compensate. If you quickly dash back to iStat to check, you'll see the figure is higher, then will rapidly drop away again.\nIf VSCode is constantly ramping the FPS up to 60, then it is just badly coded & wasting energy. Even YouTube will only lift the FPS to the rate of the video currently playing. Any more would just be slightly heating up your room, nothing else.\nFrom my recent background running support for an online gaming structure for the past decade, \"bigger better faster more\" culture makes this FPS misinformation a constant bane to support staff. People just have the wrong idea of what it's for & how it works. There has been for the past few years an 'internet meme' of massive fps being \"better\" for gaming. This, so people think, is \"better\" even if your game is running 120 FPS yet your screen can only refresh at 60.\nThis is, if you think about it carefully, patently absurd.\n", "Q: Microsoft Excel on Mac Error VBA Run-Time 1004 on Application Open - Endless Loop - Cannot Use Excel When Excel is opened - no matter the document - there is a run-time error as shown in the picture below\nclicking on End does nothing but brings up the same error window again, causing a loop that causes Excel to not be usable.

How do I make this window larger by default so whenever I use 'open a file' in any program, it's not super small?\nI am referring to the window size, not the text size.\nI have the Finder (outside of 'open a file') larger by default, but I am unsure how to make this one larger.\n\n\nA: Generally speaking a window remembers the last size it was set to before closing it. That can and will be overridden on an individual folder basis. EG a folder will usually remember the size and position of the finder window that was opened to view it.\nUnfortunately the days of a truly spatial Finder went away with macOS X. So the Mac does not always remember the window size, icon arrangement and such. A feature I really miss from the Classic MacOS days.\nBut, again, macOS should remember the size that the last Finder window that was opened.\n", "Q: Why is Options button for Photos app missing in iCloud settings?

Surprisingly (by its name) it doesn't only work on Windows but also works on macOS as well. All you need to do (after you download it off the App Store) is to open the program, click 'Add A Device', type in the IP address of the device you wish to view and/or control, set all the settings to your desire, click 'set' or something similar (which will bring you back to the main menu), and double-click on the device which you wish to view and/or control and it will then connect.\nNote: you will be needed to be connected to the internet the entire time you wish to view/control the selected device.\nHere is a walk-through on how to download and use Windows Remote Desktop:\nWALKTHROUGH FOR HOW TO DOWNLOAD - https://youtu.be/3pVtdtpNMGE\nWALKTHROUGH FOR HOW TO SET UP AND USE - https://youtu.be/dJNwdJLPDS8\n\nA: If you wish to record what is currently on your screen, the easiest way on a macOS is to press Comand, Shift, 5. This will bring you to a small menu in which you can screen record or take screenshots with heaps of different options. on the bottom of the screen will be where the small menu is. Simply hover the cursor over the options to see what they do. One will say 'Screen Reccord' or something similar. Click on this option and a small countdown may start (depending on the settings in 'Options') and after the countdown, it will start recording your screen - if there is no countdown it will instantly start recording - and press the stop button on the very top of your screen (where it will show the time and battery and other things) and it will save it to the desktop unless the 'Options' settings were changed.\n", "Q: Can I manually/programmatically put the battery charging on hold? I have a 2016 MBP and due to my work-from-home setup I need to use an external monitor for working, which force the Mac to use the discrete graphic card and thus a faster battery drainage (together with other software).\nGiven the advertised feature that should put the battery charging on hold at 80%, the last weekend I have updated the OS from 10.14 to 11.1, but that feature doesn't seems to work as expected: even if enabled (by default), it always charge up to 100%; sometime it happend to actually stop charging, but after a few seconds it ramped again up to 100% automatically.\nMy question is, is there a way to force that behavior ?

I have google contacts synced in mail accounts settings. I’m not sure where my contacts are actually being saved, is it iCloud?\n\nA: If you have already enabled the toggle for your Google account to sync contacts, you only need to set your Default Account in your iOS Contacts settings to be your Google Account.

I bought a Macbook Pro the other day to test out to see if I like it enough to switch from Linux on my personal laptop. Aside from numerous aches and pains as I try to learn the Mac way of doing things, one big thing that I find disconcerting is FileVault for FDE - I'm used to LUKS where I set it up during installation and I'm prompted for my password during boot, prior to reaching my graphical interface. Because of how this works and because I'm the only person who uses my computers, I tend to have a very complex LUKS password for startup, and a much less complex account password for my local user account.\nOn MacOS, however, it seems to be tied to your user account login. There's no boot prompt and it gets all the way to the MacOS user login screen before I'm asked for a password, so I have to assume that this is the only password keeping FileVault secure.\nSo I have two questions:\n\n*\n\n*Is this correct? The security of FDE on a Macbook depends on your local account password and not on a separate password?\n\n\n*Is there a way to easily verify that I have in fact correctly enabled Filevault 2?\n\nA: You can check whether FileVault2 is enabled by opening System Preferences > Security & Privacy and looking at the FileVault tab.\nPasswords for FV2 work slightly different than what you are used to from Linux:\n\n*\n\n*The FV keys are stored on your computer\n\n*Your account password is required to unlock the keys (and therefore the encrypted disk)\n\n*You need to specifically allow users to unlock a FV encrypted disk so there could be user accounts which aren't allowed to unlock (and therefore can't login until an authorized user unlocks the disk first)\n\n\nA: The way to tell if you have FileVault2 enabled is to look at the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Filevault. It tells you there whether it is enabled or not. Looks like I was beat to this part.\nAccording to the same page, \"FileVault requires that you log in every time your Mac starts up, and no account is permitted to log in automatically.\"\nI'd say you don't have it turned on, but check the Security & Privacy prefs just to double-check.\n", "Q: Big Sur terminal sometimes 5-second lag, 16in macbook pro update 5 issue seems to still be happening for another user (see comment in answer below) under macOS 11.2.3.\nupdate 4 Looks like this issue in terminal is no longer happening after updating to 11.2.3. However, there's now a similar issue in Google Chrome where having multiple tabs open and then clicking a tab does nothing, but then moving the cursor will go to that tab (the expected behavior is obviously to go the tab immediately upon clicking the tab). The \"Battery\" settings under System Preferences now has a checkbox to enable/disable discrete graphics switching (not sure if it was there before) but disabling switching causes the Chrome tab problem to go away.\nupdate 3 This just happened to me again when my macbook was at 100% battery, and plugged in. Is it possible that it's not due to the graphics switching?\nUpdate 2 Looks like this is a known bug with the hybrid graphics of my MBP, as the answer below points out. Here's another thread. Interestingly, I haven't noticed any issues in other apps like Chrome or Safari that much, just in Terminal.\nUpdate I notice that the lag seems to happen only when running on battery. Additionally, I've observed in even when not pressing return, for example when using Vim and just navigating around with hjkl, sometimes a single keypress would seem to not register, but then the second press would \"flush\" of them, or alternatively waiting about 5 seconds will \"flush\" the first press.\noriginal\nI'm using the default terminal in Big Sur using 2019 16 inch macbook pro. I'm on a clean install, with no changed settings or installed programs. Default shell settings.\nSometimes (maybe once every 15 min or so) when I input a command in terminal (e.g. ls or cd ~/Documents), and when I hit Return on my keyboard, the terminal seems to do nothing. If I press any key again, then the Return \"goes through\", along with the second key I pressed. Alternatively, if I just wait 5 seconds, the Return \"goes through\", and everything is fine.\nHas anyone else noticed this terminal lag?\n\nA: Update: confirmed issue still happens as of macOS 11.2 RC3\nExact same behavior here on a 16\" 2019 MBP, starting from when I updated to macOS 11.0 and still occurring as of 11.2 beta 2.\nAble to reproduce \"on demand\" by typing \"ls\" repeatedly in both iTerm2 as well as the built in terminal.app.\nRoot cause seems to be the Intel graphics driver, as disabling graphics switching or connecting an external monitor (which forces discrete graphics) eliminates the issue at the cost of battery life.\n\nA: I rebooted my mac and that fixed the issue\n", "Q: Search as you type in Finder I was on Windows few years back, and in that I could search any file or folder by typing out it's name inside Windows explorer. But I don't find a similar functionality in Finder on Mac. What I mean is that once I am inside a folder which has lots of files, I want to search for a specific file by typing its name. For e.g. if I want to search for a file named hello.png, I will type h, and then Finder will highlight the first file starting with h. But if I immediately type e after that, Finder then highlights the first file starting with e, and not he. So is it possible to search this way in Finder?\nI know that I can simply type the file name in Spotlight and I will find it, but this does not work when selecting a file from browser. For e.g. when you want to upload some file, a Finder dialogue opens wherein you have to select one file. Here, a 'search as you type' feature will be very handy.\nEDIT: Updating my OS to 11.1 somehow fixed this issue. But thanks to all those who helped to review this!\n\nA: You're not typing fast enough.\nIt only waits maybe half a second, maximum, before discarding your 'h' request then starting over with your 'e'.\nHere's a gif to demonstrate.

Unfortunately, this is out of\nscope for this project.\n\nIt clearly states that video output (e.g. HDMI) is not supported by this project.\nThey further clarify:\n\nFor whatever reason, an update to macOS High Sierra broke support for the displays attached to the TB16.\n\nand also mention to upgrade the firmware of the dock:\n\nYou could try performing a firmware upgrade on the TB16, which has been reported to restore video (HDMI output). However, the firmware upgrade must be performed from Windows.\n\n\nThere is also a Thread about this issue on Apples own forums, suggesting to try this GitHub project, yet it is older and untested on newer hardware/software (i.e. make backups of your system and know how to revert these changes!).\nYou could try to reset SMC, NVRAM/PRAM and boot into safe mode.\nYou could try a clean install, but it looks like this specific Dell dock is finicky with Apple hardware.\n", "Q: is there a tab snooze plugin for Safari? I've been looking around on DuckDuckGo and App Store for a Safari plugin that will let me \"snooze\" (similar to this Chrome plugin). Coming from Chrome, I've really come to rely on the ability to just set a timer and kick tabs off to the background for a period of time and then return (this also frees up memory).\nSo far I've found nothing. I'm hoping I'm just bad at searching and am missing something.\n\nA: You can try Snoozz. It works in Safari with some caveats. From the docs:\n\nWhat's broken?\nSnoozing windows: This requires use of the tabs API. Using that API,\nyou will see a privacy popup every single time you try to snooze a\nwebsite you have not snoozed before. The popup explicitly states Grant\nthe extension permission to read all your data on this site which is\ngoing to put off a lot of users.\nNotifications: Safari does not support the notifications API.\nKeyboard Shortcuts: Safari does not let you configure your own\nkeyboard shortcuts.\nInconsistent wake up times: Safari does not support the idle API. It\nis used to calculate the next tab to wake up after your computer comes\nback from standby. It's very likely that your tabs will not wake up\nuntil you interact with the extension in any way.\nUI bugs: This extension was designed for Chrome and Firefox, so things\nmight look a teeny bit off.\n\n", "Q: Noob struggling to tell terminal to install scikit-image 0.16.2 for Pyxelate I'm using macOS Catalina version 10.15.7\nI think this should be a very easy install, but apparently not.\nAt first, I spotted terminal told me I don't have Cython.

But the Dock only shows the three most recent applications. How can I make the Dock show more than three?\n\nNote: I know that if you have more than three applications open it shows all of them. I am interested in showing more than three even if they are not currently running.\nAlso note: I am not talking about the setting System Preferences > General > drop down box for Recent items, which is 10 by default and has little to do with the Dock (so this question is not a duplicate of How to increase the number of applications shown in the Recent Applications stack on the Dock)\nBonus: ideally I would like to configure this from the command line rather than the GUI.\n\nA: I was looking for this myself. It took some digging and experimenting, but I figured it out.\nYou need to add two keys to your com.apple.dock.plist: show-recents and show-recent-count.

It seems that this setting is lost regularly (maybe for every Chrome auto-update?). How can I make this setting permanent?\n\nA: This is tracked here (I think.) Sounds like it's fixed and hopefully will be corrected in a coming chrome version.\n\nA: This setting is permanent from the System's perspective, so this is a bug with Google Chrome. You're probably right that the auto-update process is causing problems.\nYou can try completely uninstalling Chrome and installing it, since that might fix some installation issue that was causing this to manifest.\n", "Q: Does QuickTime automatically record stereo audio into mono? I connect Zoom h4n Pro to my Mac via USB as audio interface. I then record audios with QuickTime.\nThe input of h4n is stereo; the right & left inputs are not exactly the same. But it seems that QuickTime automatically mixes the left & right channels; as a result, the generated audio file has same volumes from left and right.\nCould anyone confirm me that it is true?\n\nA: I have the same issue and my solution is pretty straightforward. I use ffmpeg to convert the audio to mono.\nInstall\nBrew:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nInstall ffmpeg:\nbrew install ffmpeg\n\nConvert audio:\nffmpeg -i screenRecord.mov -ac 1 screenRecordMono.mov\n\n\nA: I'm having the same issue (Scarlett i2i USB hardware):\nCan't get QuickTime to record in stereo\nI confirmed that Audacity records in stereo - even at the same time as QuickTime records in mono.\nI called Apple and they were pretty clueless. It's possible (and painful) to detach the audio track from the QuickTime movie and attach the Audacity track instead - iMovie can be cajoled to do it reluctantly. I haven't found a better solution yet.\n", "Q: Is there a way for me to view my Apple Watch Activity data on my mac desktop? I'd like to be able to view my apple watch Activity data on my mac desktop or laptop.\nSo for example, workouts, steps, etc, today, and for the last week, much like what I can find in the Activity app on the apple watch.\nI've logged into iCloud.com to see if it was there, but it's not, and I looked for an Activity app on my mac desktop, but don't see one. I've also googled this a bunch, and found this suggested answer - not supported - on Apple's communities site, but would love to find a third party solution to do this, if one exists.\nIs there anyway I can see some of my personal health data secured in the health app on my Mac?\n\nA: Not today from Apple. You would need to screenshot images from the iPhone or get a third party app to request permission on iOS and export the data. The health app data is tightly restrained and only interacts with electronic health records and iOS/watchOS apps.\nApple documentation is quite out of date, since the advice on finding compatible apps is no longer correct.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204351\nI’ve tried a couple and can not recommend any. Should that change, I’ll edit this answer to say which apps I trust and that do a good job extracting summary data like you requested. I just use my phone for now to review it when I can’t get what I need from my watch itself.\n", "Q: How to check my iOS-backup password When backing up iOS devices to the mac, encrypted backups are possible. Is there a way to test my password, which I think is correct, without trying to restore some iPad from this backup?\nI want to make sure that I not only have my iPad backed-up, but also make sure that I remember the password correctly.\nI would prefer not to \"pretend\" I want to change my password, just to check if my password works.\nAny Ideas?\nI am on macos Catalina and iPadOS 14.3.\n\nA: If you saved it in keychain, it will auto-fill in the Change Password dialog.\nIf so, it's listed in keychain as \"iOS Backup\", where you can open the plaintext version to see.\n\nIf not, then I think you'll have to try changing it to see if you remembered it correctly. I don't know if it will allow changing to the same password - never tested that.\n\nA: I just tested the changing password approach and it works. You additionally have to verify the password change by entering your code on your phone while it is connected.\nAnother option would be to download a program like iBackup viewer.\nThen you can also see what the backup contains.\n", "Q: USB C to Ethernet on iPad Air 4 in hotel The WiFi in my hotel room has been dropping video calls so I got a USB C to ethernet adapter and plugged it into my iPad Air 4 running the latest iOS. Ethernet settings appear in the settings app and show an IP address but nothing will connect to the internet.\nApple Support was at a loss so I called the hotel’s internet provider and the agent said she could authorize my device for internet. Great. But she needed a specific address from my iPad. She said it’s a USB key. I have no idea what this means or where to find it in iOS.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You are getting good advice and the hotel probably needs the hardware media access control address which is like a serial number on the adapter. If you can’t find that out from a computer, manufacturer support, the labeling on the part or the box, ask if you can use a web browser to navigate to http://captive.apple.com to register.\nYou can also ask them if setting the DHCP client ID or address manually works. You can’t discover the ethernet MAC address from iOS 14 (afaik) - here is what you can see and control in the settings app if you tap Ethernet.\n\nFor WiFi and Bluetooth you can see these addresses on iPhone and iPad  (like 16:00:DD:EE:FF:78 ) and even specify a private one different than the factory address, but this doesn’t apply to ethernet adapters currently.\n", "Q: MacOS Catalina duplicating files on save I'm a software developer and I constantly need to save files of course. The problem I'm experiencing right now is that intermittently my laptop creates new files of the ones I'm saving/compiling. I'll provide an example in a minute. My thought initially was that perhaps this is due to some file permissions I'm not looking at. I've had this laptop for a couple of months now and this is the only problem I've encountered. It has happened on both Visual Studio Code and Atom. I also thought this was because of the language I'm using but it also happening with NodeJS applications I've worked with. And while this does not cause any malfunction, it is very annoying every time I need to compile a project my terminal screen is super cluttered with errors because these files are not valid.\nThe errors go like this\n[error] beam/beam_load.c(1433): Error loading module 'Elixir.Poison.Encoder.FileName 4':\n\nSo it creates files like the one above but replace '4' with whatever number it decides to put, it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on... I've deleted the build directory of my projects to get rid of the error but it is only temporary. Thanks in advance and let me know what else I can provide to make this easier to debug.\n\nA: Do you save these files in iCloud Drive? To prevent data loss, iCloud will sometimes resolve sync issues by making a copy with a number on the end that holds the alternate file contents.\nThere is no way to avoid this, since it's a data consistency measure. You can keep your source code outside of iCloud Drive – I myself have a folder outside of iCloud specifically for Git repositories that are stored elsewhere.\n", "Q: Safari 14: how to view cookies' content In Safari 14 for Mac, how can I view the contents of the cookies set by a given site? I know how to delete them, but I would like to see exactly what's in them.\nI have tried loading the site with Safari's Developer Tools, but the \"Cookies\" section in the inspector didn't have anything.\n\nA: The Cookies section is what you're looking for in the Developer Tools. Inspect it for this site, Stack Exchange, and you'll see a number of cookies and their values.\nInspect Element > Storage > Cookies\n", "Q: How to add ImageJ to list of apps that can access system's camera (or other USB wecams)? I would like to add a program to the list of apps that can access my laptop's camera.  I have a MacBook pro with OS 11.1.  Specifically, I want to use the ImageJ's webcam plugin to control a USB endoscope.  I can get the endoscope to work with PhotoBooth, but I want to use the features in the webcam plugin.  ImageJ just says \"No webcam detected\" and I can't find a way to add programs to the list of allowed apps in the Security & Privacy settings. I looked through some previous threads and didn't see a solution.\n\nA: There is not a process to \"request\" camera access–instead, applications simply try to access the camera. ImageJ need not know about the approval process to try to access the webcam.\nYou cannot add an app that has never tried to use your camera to this list.\n", "Q: Command for resolving ip address for host entry in /etc/hosts?

In my Apple Notes automation on macOS Big Sur, I’d like to load any 5 notes whose name contains a substring. For example, if I know that I actually have 5 notes that match the query, I can write something like this:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n  set matches to id of (notes 1 thru 5 in default account whose name contains \"a\")\nend tell\n\nThis runs relatively fast (< 1 second on my account with thousands of notes), because it terminates as soon as it finds those 5 matches and doesn’t look any further. For comparison, a query without such \"1 thru 5\" clause (or a count query) times out before it even returns any results, which is understandable. However, my problem is that if there aren’t enough (i.e., fewer than 5) matches, the query will error without returning any results:\n\nNotes got an error: Can’t get notes 1 thru 5 of default account whose name contains \"a\". Invalid index.\n\nThus, my question is whether there’s a way for me to get \"at most 5 results\" in a single query?\n\nA: \nThus, my question is whether there’s a way for me to get \"at most 5 results\" in a single query?\n\nNo, it cannot be done in a single query.\nIf you want to loop through a given count downwards then the following example AppleScript code is how I'd do it:\nset maxNumber to 5\nset searchString to \"a\"\n\nset matches to missing value\nrepeat with i from maxNumber to 1 by -1\n    if matches is equal to missing value then\n        try\n            tell application \"Notes\"\n                set matches to id of ¬\n                    (notes 1 thru i in default account ¬\n                        whose name contains searchString)\n            end tell\n        end try\n        if matches is not equal to missing value then exit repeat\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nreturn matches\n\n", "Q: What is storagekitd? I'm actually surprised I'm asking this as I would've thought there'd be something online regarding what this process is. I apologize if I didn't search hard enough...\nI'm curious to know what exactly storagekitd is and why it might be taking up so much of my memory! I'm on an M1 Mac mini with 8 GB of RAM \n\nA: I don't have deeper knowledge why this might take up so much RAM but this is what I found. You could also try to find out more about the process by clicking the info button in the menu bar. Do you see any connections to a certain program you are running?\nHere they describe it as a part of the Disk Utility Program.\n\nOpen Disk Utility in Sierra or later (possibly El Capitan and earlier too), and watch in Activity Monitor for the appearance of storagekitd. This is the StorageKit daemon which runs as root and performs most of the work for Disk Utility. One reason that Apple has adopted this level of complexity is that many of the actions which Disk Utility has to perform require root privileges. Disk Utility runs in userland: in Activity Monitor, its user is you. To give it secure access to actions requiring root privileges, storagekitd is a helper, running as root.\n\nOn this website it is described as:\n\nstoragekitd is used by the StorageKit framework for disk state keeping and privileged operations. It is used by various clients in macOS. It\nis not meant to be invoked directly.\n\nMaybe this helps to find out why it is taking up so much of the RAM.

I need those apps to work for now, so I quit the install. But now every day I get a reminder to update, or be reminded again tomorrow. No way to opt out is given.\nHow can I remove the update files to avoid the pesky daily reminder?\n\nA: Try doing a search for \"Catalina\" or \"Big Sur\" in Finder or delete the Install macOS [Catalina/Big Sur] from your ~/Applications folder.\nThough that won't remove the reminder.

Both commands gave me an error saying that the disk failed to mount. I also tried mounting it through Disk Utility but nothing happens.\nI need those files because it contains the password of the computer. How am I going to see the files?\n\nA: I'd recommend using target disk mode to copy the files to a location that's available on your working computer, eg. a properly formatted & mounted external drive.\n\nA: Your  cp destroyed whatever filesystem there was on the external disk because you copied to the device itself without mounting it first. To fix:\n\n*\n\n*format the external disk on the other Mac (HFS+ should be fine)\n\n*boot old Mac into single user\n\n*mount the external disk (mkdir /Volumes/mydisk; mount /dev/disk1s2 /Volumes/mydisk)\n\n*copy the files to the mounted disk (cp files /Volumes/mydisk/)\n\n*unmount disk before unplugging (umount /Volumes/mydisk)\n\n", "Q: How can I change my desktop background?

That's good, I want that.\nIssue\nThere's only one exception where I want to use Finder, and that's when opening the /Applications folder, since Marta is unable to delete stuff from /Applications.\nI know this can be done with applescript, but applescripts have a few seconds' delay before they run, which I'm hoping to eliminate by using bash instead.\nThe purpose of all this is to have a script which can be called from raycast.\nSo far I've tried:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app /Applications # requires sudo\n\nopen /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app --args /Applications # just opens Finder but doesn't open the folder\n\n\nA: Testing in both macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur, the following command in Terminal opens a Finder window to /Applications:\nopen -a Finder /Applications\n\n", "Q: How to format a USB drive and increase its available size? I have a 32 GB USB flash drive which is currently formatted to 261 MB:\n\nHow can I reformat/erase that USB drive so that I access all 30.75 GB of it?\nDisk utility won't let me change the size of the partition to 30.75 GB.\nUpdate 1: I erased the drive. At the end, there was this dialog box.\n\nUpdate 2: I took the path of least resistance and changed the size of the drive to 30 GB on a Windows machine (discmgmt.dsc utility).\n\nA: If you can you might trying erasing the disk and then reformat it. You will, of course, lose everything written to disk. If you want to keep what's on the disk you could copy it you main drive. Disk utility allows you to erase the disk and then reformat it.\nAfter opening Disk Utility go to the Edit menu and at the top of the panal you'll see option to erase, partition, and other commands.\n\nA: I don’t know a good way to test disks for sizing without a third party program or command line tools.\nThe former, I use SD Clone: https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/sd-clone-3-getting-started/\nThe latter - try these commands once you get the unix disk number from Disk Utility or another means - be 100% sure you have a backup of every single drive connected. If you get the drive number wrong (in the linked question the USB drive to be erased is disk3 and those numbers can change each time you eject and mount a drive), you will erase without a chance of recovery whichever drive you perform this on:\ndiskutil list diskX\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ TestDisk disk3\ndiskutil list diskX\n\nWhen I say “be sure of your backup”, that you have set aside the time and steps needed to restore that backup - not just “maybe it’s current and I haven’t checked it for a while” type backup. Hopefully it’s a quick erase and not that the disk itself is broken or mislabeled.\n", "Q: Change File Picker Dialog folder location (avoid latest visited folder) Whenever a File picker dialog (MacOs Catalina) is being open by a website or in general within the operating system, the UI shows as a default folder the latest used/visited one.\nLet's consider this typical workflow:\n\n*\n\n*I'm saving a file in Word using the Save button, which brings up a File Picker Dialog and I save my document in let say ~/Desktop/myfolder\n\n*After some time (even hours later) a website prompts me for a file Upload, which opens the same File Picker Dialog\n\n*Here's the issue: File Picker Dialog opens - by default- into the latest used folder from the Picker Dialog, so the file Picker UI will show files in ~/Desktop/myfolder.\n\nThis is pretty inconvenient as it can expose privacy files when screen-sharing or when having someone next to me when collaborating at the laptop .\nIs it possible to use a Default folder for the file picker that opens up always for example in ~/Desktop or just ~ ?\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, there's no way to do anything like this natively.\nThere is such as Default Folder X which can remember 'last folder per app' or just always return to a specific location per app, with navigation history & fast click-through to any folder already open. You can set up different default sets depending on workflow.\nI've actually had it on every Mac I've ever had since before they added the 'X' to the name, before OS X.

This tends to mean that after 5 years, whilst you can continue running the Mac, software availability will gradually drop behind. Once you can no longer upgrade to the latest macOS, then you probably have 3 years of continued security & OS updates. After that, you're on your own.\nA consequence of this is that High Sierra is now more than 3 entire OS revisions old & is completely out of support.\nThis historical support does appear in recent years to have shortened, but this does happen periodically. Sometimes the underlying technology in a major OS release means that older hardware & OSes can no longer conform to the newer practises.\nThis happened in two steps this time, first at Mojave & then with a bigger step to Catalina.\nI suppose that leaves us with another \"why\" question, which we can't answer -\n\"Why can I not get an older version of an app from the App Store?\".\n", "Q: Laravel from Scratch - Traversy YouTube - SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] error when run PHP artisan migrate I'm running PHP 7.4.9, Laravel 8 and MAMP 6.0.1 and am learning Laravel.\nThose of you running MAMP and following this excellent tutorial will find in Video 5 that you will get this error when attempt to run the PHP artisan migrate command in video #5:\nSQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) (SQL: select * from information_schema.tables where table_schema = lsapp and table_name = migrations and table_type = 'BASE TABLE')\nIt looks like a basic mySQL issue but it's not, it's due to some missing configuration in the defaul Laravel configuration for MAMP users.

I am trying to bundle a .jar executable into an application using the solution provided here: How to create a .app folder from an executable .jar?. I deduced that main.script inside Contents -> Resources -> Scripts is using the computer's global directories, not the application's local directory. Thus, it fails. I found a proposed solution on this page: Wrong working directory, if bash script is opened via double-click. Unfortunately, even this code does not seem to function as intended. For demonstration, I have placed the .jar in the same folder as the script. Here is is the AppleScript code I am trying to use:\ndo shell script \"DIR=$( cd \\\"$( dirname \\\"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\\\" )\\\" && pwd )\ncd \\\"${DIR}\\\"\n\njava -jar execute.jar\"\n\nNote that the Bash quotation marks are escaped; here is the raw code:\nDIR=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\" && pwd )\ncd \"${DIR}\"\n\njava -jar execute.jar\n\nThe first line ought to find the directory of the script, the second ought to navigate to that directory, and the third ought to find and run \"execute.jar.\" As I've said, it doesn't. I would troubleshoot more if I knew enough Bash—this is the most in-depth I've ever gone. I verified all three lines independently, which means that the DIR definition is picking its directory off of a freshly-opened Bash/Terminal, independent of the script.\nIsn't this sort of like \"the chicken or the egg?\" The DIR function gives the current directory, which is then used to set the current directory with cd?\n\nA: This is how I'd handle a scenario such as you've described.\nI'd place the execute.jar file in the Resources folder within the application bundle, e.g.:\n../Untitled.app/Contents/Resources/\n\nThen use the following example AppleScript code within the AppleScript script that is a part of the AppleScript application bundle:\nset pathToJAR to ¬\n    quoted form of ¬\n    POSIX path of ¬\n    (path to resource \"execute.jar\")\n\nset shellCMD to ¬\n    {\"/usr/bin/java -jar \", pathToJAR} ¬\n        as string\n\ndo shell script shellCMD\n\nNow no matter where the application bundle is saved to or copied/moved to, as coded, it will ascertain its location to the resource, the execute.jar file, and be able to run a do shell script command that will execute the shell command accordingly.\n\nTo address your comment:\n\nI have an image that stays next to the .jar and is supposed to open with it. If I manually open the contents of the application bundle and run the .jar, the image is loaded in; if the AppleScript code is run, the image is not found. Any ideas?\n\nTry the following example AppleScript code instead:\nset pathToMe to ¬\n    quoted form of ¬\n    POSIX path of ¬\n    (path to me)\n\nset shellCMD to ¬\n    {\"cd \", pathToMe, ¬\n        \"Contents/Resources/; \", ¬\n        \"/usr/bin/java -jar execute.jar\"} ¬\n        as string\n\ndo shell script shellCMD\n\n", "Q: iPad not accepting Apple ID For some time now my iPad Air 2 has been pestering me to enter my Apple ID.

How can I easily run multiple sites with PHP, Apache and mySQL for free on mac with OSX? I use XAMPP on Windows and it works really well. When I want to add a new site on XAMPP in windows, I only create a new folder in htdocs and visit http://localhost/newfoldername to visit the site.\nI know mac OS already have PHP but missing mySQL. However, I thought it was messy when I tested it.\nXAMPP - (https://www.apachefriends.org) is not the same on mac and Windows. On mac you need to mount a drive to access the htdocs folder and it was hard to have multiple sites.\nMAMP free - (https://www.mamp.info/) can't find how I add multiple sites. I tested to create a new folder \"test\" with a php-file in htdocs but the webserver could not find the site when I visited http://localhost/test\nMAMP PRO - I want to use a free solution (freeware or open source) and you need to pay to use MAMP PRO.\nI can live with digging in configuration files once but do not want to do it every time I set up a new PHP site in localhost.\n\nA: All of these options have a GUI which is helpful.  You could install Apache/MySQL/PHP with Homebrew or MacPorts, but you would be managing all of the settings manually. While this is the best way to get all of the options for free, this increases the difficulty curve.\nAs another option, I have Abyss Web Server running on my machine to act as a local dev server.  The free version allows for 1 site though, there are more features with the paid version.\nAs with any of these options, you will have to pay for the extra features when using a GUI.\nI looked into this years ago when Apple Server abandoned web services. I hope you find something that will work for you.\n\nA: Almost all of the macOS versions have a built-in Apache server.  It used to be easier to turn it on, but lately it looks like you have to run /usr/sbin/apachectl start to start it.  It seems to be persistent, launching again after reboots, so you should only need to run that once.\nThen, add folders inside /Library/Webservers/Documents, or better yet, a symlink to somewhere else where you keep your site(s).  I had to tweak httpd.conf a little bit I think, to get Perl CGI to run, it should be simple to get PHP working too, since that's built into macOS too (at least on mine, 11.1).\nYou can go the full MAMP/XAMPP route if you want, but this is super simple too.\n", "Q: What is the default wm for mac I am sorry if this is a stupid question, but which window manager does macOS use?\n\nA: There is no separate window manager on macOS, the windowing environment is part of the OS itself.\n", "Q: I have a USB audio interface with multiple inputs and am looking for a way to force one input to left and another to right I can do this in a DAW like Ableton Live by selecting individual inputs and panning as needed, one track per input and combine.

This is not just an \"only an audiophile would hear the difference\" kind of thing, the audio actually sounds like it's being routed over the phone around the planet.\nAs far as I can tell macOS offers no way of disabling an input device altogether, not from the audio system settings or the Audio MIDI Setup. Or at least that doesn't appear possible for devices such as AirPods.\nmacOS wants to enable my AirPods as the default input device every time I put them in/on or even if (when paired to macOS) I unlock an iOS device and it checks if it should automatically switch over to that.\nI have tried fittingly named features of both the app ToothFairy and AirBuddy but from what I can gather they only set the devices on first connect and can't watch for changes macOS tries later.\nMy current solution is running a short script in the background constantly, which checks the currently set input device every second and change that back if it looks like AirPods. This is obviously far from ideal, but at least it kinda works. I was unfortunately unable to find any NSNotification macOS fires on audio input changes to react to that instead, maybe watching coreaudiod logs here is a solution instead?\nIs there any other saner option to disable AirPods as input devices or force macOS into always using the same input device?\n(In case an Apple employee reads this, I have filed the following feedback: FB8970518)\n\nA: Maybe this can help: https://github.com/milgra/airpodssoundqualityfixer\nI've tested it with my Beats Flex and the audio input device does not change upon connections.\n", "Q: Sidecar shows blank screen.

[n] %\n\n\nA: Big Sur (macOS 11.1) seams to have problems dealing the FDisk_partition_scheme when the Extended DOS partition is not the 4th entry in the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table.\nThe OP tried to use various forms of the diskutil command to erase the current partitioning. Also, the OP tried using the dd command to overwrite the MBR table with zeros. Both diskutil and dd commands require exclusive access to disk4 before making changes. Evidently, this fails to happen.\nThe fdisk command will work with shared access. One possible solution would be to use the following to erase all the partitions.\necho \"erase\\nq\\ny\" | sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk4\n\nAnother possible solution would be to use the following to create a single FAT32 formatted volume.\necho \"auto dos\\nq\\ny\" | sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk4\nsudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -v MYSDCARD /dev/disk4s1\ndiskutil mount disk4s1\n\n\nNote: I have observed the mountdisk verb of diskutil command does not always mount all mountable and UI-browsable volumes on the given partition map.\n\n", "Q: iMac screen shows nothing after replacing hard drive I replaced the hard drive on my iMac 8,1 (iMac 20-Inch \"Core 2 Duo\" (Early 2008)) per OWC's instructions with an SSD I had sitting around. I used a 2.5\" to 3.5\" adapter that would fit the physical needs for the drive upgrade. The drive seems to be seated properly and connected as needed.\nAfter reconnecting wires as instructed, I ran into an issue where the screen is lighting up (the backlight seems to be working fine) and I hear the Apple chime/sound effect, but nothing is displayed. I'm watching the screen and waiting up to 5 minutes, and no icons or UI ever appear.\n\nI tried connecting a separate SATA cable with an external drive, but that made no difference.\nI thought that the arrangement of the inverter cables may have mattered, and read people with similar models saying it did matter. However, iFixIt's guide (Step 11, specifically) clarified that the cable arrangement should not matter.\n\nDuring reassembly, the order of the inverter cables is interchangeable within each socket.\n\nPlus, the clips and \"dots\" on the inverter plugs line up in a way that there's only one way to orient them properly within the plugs and I tried multiple cable arrangements anyway to see if it changed anything.\nI reset the PRAM, but no luck there either. The behavior was the same. A gray screen, the chime, all 4 green debug/diagnostic LEDs on the main logic board were illuminated, but no other visual feedback indicated anything was working.\nI connected my macOS 10.11 El Capitan installer USB, which I know works. El Capitan's the most recent version of macOS this hardware will install and the USB device worked fine with the old hard drive. Nothing happens when I boot with the USB device plugged in. I keep manually rebooting, but have no visual feedback for what's happening.\nUnfortunately, I have no DisplayPort cable to use with an external display.\nWhat is going on here? Is something broken?\n\nA: Press the Option (or Alt) ⌥ key on boot. This will allow you to enter the Startup Manager and boot from the USB device.\nI do not know why the screen is gray and doesn't simply default to the Startup Manager automatically. That would be a nicer experience since the gray screen that never does anything is obviously a bit confusing.\nWhatever the reason for the gray screen, explicitly pressing the Option key before the boot chime works. The display was fine all along. The issue was just that the mac wasn't doing anything by default, and launching the boot manager explicitly then booting from the USB installer works fine as expected.\n", "Q: Is a copy of /Library and ~/. sufficient for a clean install? The title says it all. After too many OS X and now macOS upgrades-in-place, my disk is cluttered with too much history. There is also the occasional small but unnerving issue that may just be resolvable by a clean install.\nMoving from Catalina (10.15) to (10.16 version 11), my plan is to save just /Library and ~/.. Is any other path necessary to maintain personalized settings?\n(After upgrading disk-to-disk—as opposed to time-machine-to-disk—I haven't been able to continue using my Time Capsule histories, and hence I'll be wiping these and starting fresh.)\n\nA: Yes, a copy of /Library and ~/. (which includes ~/Library) will retain most of your personalised settings. You may want to also include /Users/Shared as it is used by a few apps (e.g. from Adobe) to store licences and/or settings.\nBut the copy will include much of your clutter and history.  This will defeat the purpose of a 'clean' install.\nA clean install requires you to erase the disk, reinstall macOS, reinstall applications and recover your documents, photos, etc. (but, sadly, not settings) from your backup.  This process will require you to enter application licenses and re-establish settings.\nYou need to judge whether the time and effort of a true clean install is worth it for you.\nPersonally, I do a clean install every 18 months or so - but that is because I am something of an app junkie.\n\nA: Some of /Library may not be copyable (or replaceable) due to SIP.  And if you do copy back files, you might inadvertently overwrite files that needed to change in the update.\nA better approach would be a TM backup → erase → install → use migration assistant to restore account and settings from backup.\n", "Q: 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar (A1706) Doesn't Boot When Battery is Plugged In First time posting here so I'm sorry if I mess anything up.\nI have a 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar 13\" that refuses to charge or boot when the battery is connected (It will boot when plugged into the charger and even with the battery data cable plugged in, just not when the battery power is connected). With it booted (battery disconnected) everything works normal. The computer is not receiving power when the battery is connected (no haptic feedback on trackpad, lights, fans, etc.).\nOpening up the computer and giving it a visual inspection shows no physical damage, corrosion or water damage on either side of the logic board. On one of the USB-C ports I noticed what looked like a little bit of corrosion so I cleaned it off.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Different charger cable/block (OEM)\n\n*New battery (OEM)\n\n*Reset SMC\n-This one is a little weird. When I try to reset the SMC, per Apple's instructions (T1 with     non-removable battery-I leave the battery plugged in and charger connected) the computer refuses to boot unless I disconnect the battery. So I'm not sure if it's actually resetting or not.\nMacOS says battery - \"Service Recommended\", the diagnostic (Hold R while booting) shows no problems- Reference Code:APD000 (it used to give a Service Battery before I put the new battery in), and I've attached a screenshot of CoconutBattery.\nIf anybody has any ideas of what else to check or to try that would be huge help. If there's any other info. that you need me to provide that I didn't please let me know. Thank you!\n\n\nA: Solved: Battery was defective (battery entered sleep state and was unable to be woken up). Got another new battery and everything works as should.\n", "Q: How do I save everything on my phone and clear iCloud storage? I have an iPhone X with 256 GB of storage, which is a lot. However I have very little iCloud storage. How can I save everything that is on my phone, to my phone, and then clear iCloud and wipe it clean? I know that iCloud provides a backup and a way to see things from different devices, but I won't lose my phone, and I can probably find a way to upload single files to iCloud.\nI have tried not letting the device upload to iCloud, but the AppleID and iCloud section on settings is grayed out (parental controls) and when I tried it on laptop it just cut off the connection without saving to the device or clearing the space on iCloud.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Although I am unfamiliar with the workings of parental controls, I would imagine it's possible to access (a part of) the data stored on iCloud Drive via the Files app. It is then possible to move said data to your \"On my iPhone\" folder, which will save it to your local file system.\nAs for the other data: Have you asked your parents for help with removing the data from iCloud? They will most likely have to (temporarily) disable your parental controls, after which you should be able to choose what is synced to iCloud. It should then also be possible to delete said data.\nOn an unrelated note: I would recommend creating a backup of your iPhone to your laptop. However unlikely, iPhones (as all electronic devices) can die unexpectedly. Having a backup is useful in such cases. If you give more information on the \"cutoff\" as you described, I would be happy to help with that as well.\n", "Q: What are the different columns in this Terminal display? I am wondering what the different columns are in this attached screenshot of the Terminal window.

There is another column to the right with the file names. I left that out of the screenshot for privacy purposes.\n\n\nA: From left to right, the columns are: permissions (e.g., read, write, execute), then the number of links, the owning user of the file, the owning group of the file, the file size (bytes for files, 512 byte blocks for directories), and the last time the file was accessed. The column you didn't show on the far right is the name of the file in question.\nFor future reference, you can always run man <command> to find information about a command.

I have a txt file which has 5,000 data points separated by commas.\ni.e. data123,data456,data17,data918,etc,etc\nIf I open this txt file in Numbers, it creates each item as its own column, whereas I want each item to be its own row.\nI can use the Table > Transpose Rows and Columns option, but Numbers is only able to have a maximum of 1,000 columns, and so there are 4,000 points of data that are missing from my spreadsheet using this method.\nIs there a way that I can open the txt file in Numbers with the comma separated values each being created as a row instead of a column to begin with?\nThank you so much for any help!\n\nA: An easy way\nOpen the Terminal application and navigate to the folder containing your .txt file. If you know how to use cd, use that. If you don't then open Finder and click on the folder containing your file and press ⌥⌘C. This will copy the path to the folder to your clipboard. Then in Terminal type, (pasting the clipboard ⌘V where it says <paste_here>):\ncd '<paste_here>'\n\nand run the following command, replacing <your_file_name> with the name of your file and <new_file_name> for the name you want to give the transposed output.\ncat <your_file_name> | tr ',' '\\n' > <new_file_name>\n\nIn case you aren't sure what's going on here: \ncat takes one or more file names and outputs their contents \n| takes the output of the thing on the left and sends it to the thing on the right \ntr replaces any instances of the first character (, in this case) and replaces it with the second character (\\n means a new line)\nLearning how to use Terminal will help you solve these kinds of problems very easily. If you want to learn more about it, google \"unix/linux shell scripting\" and the language being used is \"bash\".\n\nA better way\ntr ',' '\\n' < infile > outfile\n\nI gave the first answer because I felt it was easier to understand for someone who is new to shell scripting. But we can optimize this command by using file redirection (command < filename) instead of cat. Cat is an external program, so we should get rid of it in the command if there is no reason to load it. tr doesn't accept filename arguments but it does accept standard input. Here we redirect \"infile\" to standard input (< infile) which is read by the command (tr ',' '\\n'), then we write the output to outfile (> outfile).\nYou can also write this as: \\\n< infile tr ',' '\\n' > outfile\n\nI prefer writing it this way because it follows the same order as the commands are executed: \n| Command       | Action                                         |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| < infile    | redirect file named \"infile\" to standard input |\n| tr ',' '\\n' | replace commas with newlines                   |\n| > outfile   | write standard out to filename \"outfile\"       |\n", "Q: Ways to find out uptime of Apple Watch?

I don't know much about lightning ports working with thunderbolt ports or USB 3, so I don't want to buy something with fast data transfer rate but only to be limited by the data transfer rate of iPhone 5s's lightning port.\nSo what type or types of cable can give the highest data transfer rate for an iPhone 5s?\n\nA: The iPhone 5S offers USB 2.0 over its Lightning connector (USB 2.0 high speed maxes out at 480 Mbit/s ~ 0.5 Gb/s).\nYou will need either a USB-A to Lightning cable or a USB-C to Lightning cable. Combined with your current Mac Mini, either will give you the highest data transfer rate possible with the iPhone 5S.\n", "Q: pam_tid.so asks for password instead of requesting for fingerprint when docked I used to use auth sufficient pam_tid.so in the /private/etc/pam.d/sudo file to allow fingerprint authentification when using sudo command.\nRecently upgraded my MBP for a new M1 under macOS Big Sur (11.1), and the change still works.\nHowever, suddenly, this stopped working. Instead of asking for fingerprint, it asks me for password in the GUI (not in the terminal).\nAfter digging around, I did a macOS recovery install and it resolved the problem.\nToday, the problem appears again but the recovery install didn't fix it.\nI just discovered that this only happens when my MBP is docked to my docking station with 4 external screens and hard drive. I need to understand what is causing this issue, I guess this may be related to the display link USB video driver.\nHas anybody an idea on what's going wrong?\n\nA: I had reported something similar to Apple (in my case, I was experiencing this issue while using pam_tid and sudo while running a Screen Recording). They told me that currently, this is working as designed, but that there is a workaround available by running:\ndefaults write com.apple.security.authorization ignoreArd -bool TRUE\n\nI am still unsure why this is designed this way in the first place, or what other effects this setting might have, as they did not elaborate other than to provide the workaround. I'm curious to know if this is also a suitable workaround for the DisplayLink issue or if it would only affect screen recordings, so please comment if you try it.\n\nA: Answer received from DisplayLink Support:\nhttps://support.displaylink.com/forums/287786-displaylink-feature-suggestions/suggestions/42614770-bug-sudo-with-touchid-disabled-when-using-a-docke\n\nUnfortunately we are aware of this problem but this is one of our driver limitations. At the moment we are unable to change it as it happens due to the way MacOS is treating our application/driver.\nIn order to change that we would need Apple to change some options in their OS. I believe that in the future we will be able to resolve such issues but for now there is nothing that I can propose.\n\n", "Q: How to delete all voice memos stored on iphone in one go?

You likely have some corruption on the storage and if following the normal activation process fails, support or jailbreak or repair would be next steps.\nDoing the activation from a computer lets you get diagnostic logs and may be the best next step if you can’t get it on wireless.\nWorst case, try a restore and then consult support online.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252\n\n*https://support.apple.com/\nOnline support is very good now that the stores have been shuttered for months in most places and staff cross trained to field the online support queues. Support will likely conclude if the device is vintage and for most effectively obsolete and refer to external vendors, though.\n\n*\n\n*https://locate.apple.com/\n\n*obtaining support for vintage or obsolete products the iPad 2 is currently “vintage” and soon to be obsolete\n\n\nA: Your post was able to help me get my iPad2 working again so thank you for that. I was also seeing the same error messages as you. Mine is the cellular model but I haven't used a SIM card with it for years.\nI did the Recovery Mode process connected to my laptop running OS 11.6. The iPad couldn't Restore so it did an Update which took maybe an hour or so. It didn't look like anything was happening til near the end — the progress bar wasn't moving for a long time. I almost gave up on it.\nSimultaneously I had the Find My app open on my phone because I had previously marked my device as \"lost\" in the hopes that it could somehow make contact with the server so that it could be activated. After the Update, the device beeped and flashed the message I entered on the Find My, and a little while later, by some miracle it appeared on Find My and I hit the Activate button. Nothing happened. I tried hitting the Activate button again every 10-15 minutes thinking maybe it would take time for it to show up on the server. After a few tries, it activated. Hopefully it continues to stay connected.\n", "Q: How to delete audio input option in system preferences macOS I've got a problem:\nSince I am using my new Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Pro dock, the macOS dictation won't work anymore.

is there a user called nobody?\n\nA: There are a lot of places in the OS where something has to be assigned to some user account. Each file and directory must be owned by some user account, every process (program) running must be running as some user account, etc. The \"nobody\" account serves mostly as a placeholder for files, processes, etc that don't really belong to any \"real\" account (even one of the other system accounts in the list).\nEssentially, the \"nobody\" account serves as a way to restrict permissions and access to/from things that don't really belong to any \"real\" account.\nIt's also not unique to macOS at all; you'll find it (or an equivalent) on any unix/linux system, and probably many other OSes I'm less familiar with.\n\nA: Those accounts are for systems processes and to restrict access to things like files and resources by group or user.\n", "Q: Creating a new folder in Finder In macOS Catalina 10.15.4, I would like to create a new folder in Finder, in the view where directories in Finder are organised with the second button from the left (\"Show items as icons, in a list, in columns or in a gallery). Specifically, I would like to create a new folder inside a specific existing folder (let's call it \"Folder X\"). But I don't know how to do this.\nWhat I have tried, is to highlight Folder X, then click on the \"cog\" button, and then select \"New Folder\". However, this just creates a new folder at the root of all the displayed folders. It does not create a new folder inside Folder X, even though Folder X is highlighted. So, the only way I know to do this, is to create the folder as above, and then drag it into Folder X. This seems very inefficient, and there must be a way to directly create a folder in Folder X.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: The behaviour you are seeing is the way it is supposed to work.  As @benwiggy said in a comment your location is as displayed in the toolbar and that is where a new folder will be created.\nI can accept that you do not like this - you are probably not the only one. I can see two alternatives:\n\n*\n\n*Use 'column' view.  With this view your focus/location changes as\nyou go down the folder hierarchy.\n\n\n*Look for a third party Finder replacement which has the behaviour you\nwould like.  For example:\nPath Finder which behaves in the way you would like.\nForkLift which behaves like Finder.\n", "Q: Increase KeyRepeat Speed in MacOS Big Sur It seems like the method to increase the key repeat speed further than\nthe settings allow as mentioned in this question no longer works in Big Sur:\nHow to increase keyboard key repeat rate on OS X?\nHas anyone figured out a way to increase the Key Repeat speed in Big Sur?\n\nA: defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 10\n\nAnd turn off press and hold if you haven't: \\\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nI can confirm they work because I am using these settings.

Enter the commands given below.\ndiskutil erasevolume free none disk0s3\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nExplanation:\nThe disk0s3 slice occurs after the disk0s2 slice. The free space exists after the disk0s3 slice. The command diskutil erasevolume free none disk0s3 will remove the disk0s3 slice from the partition table, thus increase the size of the free space. The diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0 command can then be used to add the free space to the disk0s2 slice. In other words, disk0s3 is in the way and is preventing you from adding the free space to disk0s2.\n \n", "Q: Mac desktop says \"Unable to download App\" but the App is downloaded on the iOS device? My desktop is now running MacOS 11.1 (Big Sur).

After cleaning up, the app store's cache was missing, but the app store kept trying to update, causing an error visible in the Console app.\nThe fix was to quit the app store and restart.\nFirst attempt to update failed, but it worked on the 2nd try and I could see a new cache was created in: /Users/jsumner/Library/Containers/com.apple.AppStore/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.AppStore/Cache.db\n", "Q: Why is Apple Mail loading remote content in Spam Messages? For a while now, likely including and pre-Big Sur, whenever I actually go through my Spam box message-by-message, when I click on one message is initially loads with the spam bar, the off yellow bar that includes \"Load Remote Content\" and \"Move to Inbox\", but then the message pane \"refreshes\" and loads like normal.\nI am then reminded of this bug and annoyed, because I inevitably leaked information due to remote content loading.\nI have 3 IMAP accounts, two Gmail based and then one third party IMAP that gets no meaningful traffic. If any spam is going to it I'd be surprised, but the significant majority of them are no doubt those coming to the Gmail-based addresses I've had and used for over a decade now. (Insert old man yelling at cloud here.)\nWhy does this refresh happen? Unless I explicitly remember to click outside of a message and then ⌘a to delete them, or right click them first and use that menu to delete them, is the only way I can manage spam messages, and this means messages I'm on the fence about, but ultimately have to delete, still leak information due to the afore-described behavior.\nA screencapture recording the behavior\nA few things to call attention to:\nQuicktime Mouse Clicks are on, you can see when I click the message in the message list the \"circle\" that radiates outward from it. When I'm mousing over to the header information there is no click, no circle, just the ~2 seconds later refresh as I've described happening in this post. No keyboard keys were pressed at any time.\nMy workaround for the meantime is to not automatically load any remote content, but that's a bad solution. I'd rather that ok messages in the inbox automatically load as they're intended to be seen, and only those in junk be restricted as they initially are, before whatever happens for the junk message to \"reload as normal\".

To do so, open the Mail App and select inbox (at the top menu bar), then navigate to new inbox. You will get a new pop-up window asking you where to create the new inbox/folder (here you want to make sure it is set to local).

I tried to connect the second one using an hdmi cable with an hdmi to usb-c dongle. This one doesn't work. The system doesn't register that monitor at all, like it's not connected. However, if I connect the monitor directly to the second thunderbolt dock of the computer, it works dine.\nOn a side note - I see that the dock isn't fully functional. There are 2 usb-a ports on the dock, but it looks like I can connect only one device to either of them. Tested this using three different docking stations and multiple monitors (same cables/dongles in all situations though).\nAny help/advice would be greatly appreciated :).\n\nA: First of all do you have the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 or the Thunderbolt 3 Pro Dock?\nI'm going to assume you are using the Thunderbolt 3 Pro Dock, as the Thunderbolt 3 Dock does not have the ports to physically plug in two USB-C cables when connected to the Laptop.\nThe dock has 2x USB 3.1 type C connectors and two Thunderbolt 3 ports of one is the upstream port and the other one is connected to the Laptop. It also has a Displayport connector.\nThe problem you are having is that the two USB-C ports support data only. So my guess is that you connect the first display to the thunderbolt Port and the second one to a USB-C port which then is staying black.\nThe only way to connect two displays is using the Displayport and the thunderbolt 3 connector rather than the two adapters to USB-C. Ditch one adapter for a display port connection.\nIf any of my assumptions were wrong and this might change the perspective.

I accidentally ran system updates and that led to an error and now every time I try to boot it gets stuck on the white logo screen with no progress bar.\nI have a 1TB external drive that has a Time Machine back up on it but the problem is I haven't backed it up in the last few months. I would really like to recover the files created in these past few months. What would be the easiest solution to recover them?\nMy process so far: I bought an additional 2tb external hard drive. I booted up in Internet Recovery Mode, unmounted the internal hard drive (SSD), and created a new disk image from Container disk2 (the container for the internal hard drive) to copy onto the 2tb external hard drive. I had to use this method because the regular option \"Copy From Macintosh HD\" was greyed out. That worked and I'm in the process of verifying it in Disk Utility to make sure there's no errors. I really want to ensure that the files that I want are going to be able to be opened though. So before I restore the old Time Machine backup (from the 1 tb drive) and open the .dmg file (from the 2 tb drive) I'm thinking I should reinstall the OS in Disk Utility onto the 2tb external hard drive. Then I boot up off that and check to see if the Disk2.dmg correctly copied and I can retrieve my files.\nDoes that seem like it would work? Open to other suggestions as well. Thank you!\n\nA: I would recommend a different approach to avoid unforseen problems and make it more predictable:\nInstall macOS on the external disk and boot from it. Mount the internal disk and copy files over manually to a 3rd location - either a separate APFS volume on the external disk or a 3rd external disk. Once you've copied and verified all files, wipe and restore the backup on the internal disk.\n", "Q: What are the potential consequences of partially-disabling SIP for yabai yabai is a window management utility for macOS.\nSince macOS does not offer a suitable API to control the native window manager, yabai resorts to injecting a scripting addition into Dock.app for controlling windows. Dock.app\nis located somewhere in /System which is inaccessible thanks to by SIP.\nFor yabai to work to it's full potential, the user must  partially disable SIP with a command like csrutil disable --with kext --with dtrace --with nvram --with basesystem  (Big Sur) or csrutil enable --without debug --without fs (Mojave or Catalina).\nThis leads me to my question which is, what are the potential consequences of permanently disabling fs and debug?\n\nA: On a traditional UNIX system—including many major platforms still in use today, such as Debian—any user or process with \"root\" privileges is considered to have absolute control over a machine. There is basically nothing the OS will not allow a root user to do, whether it's rewriting system files, adding code to other processes, adding code to the kernel, you name it. If you've ever been told not to run programs as root unless absolutely necessary, this is why.\nmacOS, being itself a UNIX operating system, also behaved this way for many years. As recently as OS X 10.10 Yosemite, once you gave an app your root/administrator password, it was free to do anything it wanted, and macOS would not stand in its way.\nAll of this changed with the release of macOS El Capitan in 2015. For the first time on the Mac, Apple decided to define a set of actions which they believed no user or program—even one with root privileges—should ever be able to perform! Among these restrictions included installing kernel extensions from unidentified developers (the \"kext\" protection), injecting code into projected processes, such as apps made by Apple (the \"debug\" protection), and writing to certain protected system directories (the \"fs\" protection).\nApple called this new set of restrictions \"System Integrity Protection\", or SIP for short, and they also made it possible for advanced users to disable, by running a Terminal command from within recovery mode. Disabling SIP reverts your computer to the traditional UNIX behavior of letting root do whatever the heck it wants. Apple also made it possible to individually disable certain restrictions—for instance, running csrutil disable && csrutil enable --without debug will allow injecting code into protected processes, but still leave SIP's other protections in tact.\nSuffice to say, disabling SIP grants you a great deal of power over the way your Mac operates. I've recently been learning how to swizzle methods in Objective C; when SIP is off, you can use this to replace code in existing apps, which is really quite fun. When an app does something I don't like—whether it's Zoom making all its windows rudely float on top, or the Dictionary app not respecting my Mac's proxy settings—I can go ahead and change it.\nThe danger, however, is that if I can inject my own code into any other app, other software potentially could too! You don't need to be particularly creative to imagine the mischief an evil app could cause if it could modify every other app on your machine. For example, an app could inject its own advertisements into Safari, or tell Microsoft Word to send all of its documents to a server in North Korea.\nOn the other hand, evil apps with root permissions can wreck plenty of havoc without disabling SIP! They won't have any trouble installing bitcoin miners, reading all of your browsing history, and holding for ransom a great many (although not all!) of the files on your hard drive. In fact, a lot of these attacks don't even require root to work. Installing apps is just inherently somewhat dangerous—not unlike inviting someone into your house—unless they come from the Mac App Store, where they're guaranteed to be sandboxed.\nI'm only aware of one real-world issue caused by disabling SIP, although it was pretty bad! A couple of years ago, there was a bug in Google Chrome's updater (which sometimes requests root permissions... ugh...) which caused it to overwrite a number of core system files, rendering Macs unbootable. On Macs with SIP enabled, Chrome was prevented from deleting these files, and Chrome carried on its merry way. Presumably, Google never tested Chrome on a Mac without SIP, and so did not discover the problem prior to release. In Google's defense, they did fix the issue quickly, and I'd imagine Chrome now gets tested on Macs without SIP. (But suffice to say, uh, this is why I don't like Google Chrome.)\nYou should also be aware that on Apple Silicon Macs, Apple does not allow iOS apps to run while SIP is turned off, presumably because developers expect iOS software to only be usable in a locked-down environment. (Those developers are also wrong, because Jailbreaks exist.)\n\nGiven all of the above, my general recommendation is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have a reason to turn off SIP, leave it on. It won't do any harm.\n\n\n*If you have a reason to turn off SIP, go ahead, and don't let it keep you up at night. You need to be a bit more careful about which apps you run as root. You need to do that anyway.\nOther people can and will fall elsewhere on that spectrum. Hopefully you now have enough information to make your own decision!\n\nOkay, so, \"anything you want\" is perhaps an oversimplification. For starters, modern versions of macOS have a number of other protection systems in addition to SIP, such as TCC and AMFI. The thing is, once SIP is off, there is in theory nothing to stop a process from disabling those as well—who is going to stand in the way, when you can literally rewrite kernel memory? I suppose there are probably protected CPU registers and such.\n\nA: Disabling SIP will mean that apps that have been given root permissions will be able to modify system files, like how yabai modifies the files of the Dock. SIP usually protects these files from changes, so yabai has to have SIP disabled to modify the Dock to use advanced features.\n\nA: System Integrity Protection (SIP) as defined by Apple.\n\nSystem Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS protects the entire system\nby preventing the execution of unauthorized code. The system\nautomatically authorizes apps that the user downloads from the App\nStore. The system also authorizes apps that a developer notarizes and\ndistributes directly to users. The system prevents the launching of\nall other apps by default.\n\nMany developers, and some users, would disable SIP to let their apps work properly. Now, several years on, this is less necessary as most apps have found ways to do what they need to do without the need to disable SIP, allowing your Mac to stay more secure.\nFrom Yabai's Requirements and Caveats section. (emphasis is mine)\n\nSystem Integrity Protection needs to be (partially) disabled for yabai\nto inject a scripting addition into Dock.app for controlling windows\nwith functions that require elevated privileges. This enables control\nof the window server, which is the sole owner of all window\nconnections, and enables additional features of yabai. If you are\nrunning on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, you can reenable SIP after the\nscripting addition has been installed.\n\nI'm going to assume that this hold true for all OS's after 10.13.6. It looks as if you can re-enable SIP once the software is installed and set up, so you do not have to run it the entire time without SIP enabled. Hopefully and if possible, they will update the app to not require disabling SIP.\n", "Q: App that tells me what app is using data (Big Sur) We just installed Eero and it has the ability to report which devices are using how much data.

When purchasing a used iPhone with a completely unknown history (which includes the possibility of multiple previous owners), is it possible to reset it and be sure that all software and firmware on it is 100% identical to the factory image?\nPlease keep in mind that since the history is unknown, it's possible the device was previously jailbroken/unlocked/rooted/etc.\nIf the answer varies depending on iPhone model, please indicate to which models your answer pertains.\nI'm interested in answers for all iPhone models.\n\nPlease note:\nThe question and answers at Is it possible to return the iPhone to its very original factory state? do not help because they do not take in account the possibility of the phone being jailbroken/unlocked/rooted/etc.  Also, that question is ambiguous as to whether or not it applies to both the software and firmware.\n\nA: No, it’s not possible if the phone has received iOS updates, which it probably has.

Recently I've lost all my open Safari cards on my iPhone.

I installed iTerm2 shortly after doing a fresh install of Big Sur on my laptop. A bit after that, I installed VMware Fusion and went on with my life. Tonight, I wanted to check something in my Downloads directly in iTerm2, so I did a simple ls ~/Downloads and the privacy permissions popup appeared, saying\n\n\"VMware Fusion\" would like to access file in your Downloads folder.\n\nSince I wasn't actively using VMware Fusion -- the VM was paused and hadn't been used since I last rebooted a few hours earlier -- I said \"Don't Allow\" and went back to iTerm2, which promptly denied my viewing of my ~/Downloads directory. Odd.\nI stopped both apps, then went into the Privacy tab and deleted all \"Files and Folders\" permissions for both VMware Fusion and iTerm2, then restarted iTerm2. Went into ~/Downloads again and got the same pop-up asking for permission for VMware Fusion to access the Downloads folder. Started VMware Fusion up and it asked for permission to view files in ~/Documents.\nI'm kind of stuck on this one and not sure how to go about debugging it. I'm guessing that VMware may have stomped on some identifier that iTerm2 uses in the Privacy settings, but I'm not sure how to go about untangling this. I'm inclined try uninstalling VMware Fusion, then try it, but I'm wondering if there's something else I can do first, before taking that step.\n\nA: For what it's worth, removing VMware Fusion, then reinstalling it seems to have fixed the issue.\n", "Q: How to make Dia (which uses X11 / XQuartz) work?

Before Big Sur, a hidden Dock (at the bottom of the screen) would be unhidden only if the mouse pointer was moved to the very bottom of the screen — you literally had to slam the mouse into that last row of pixels.\nIn Big Sur, there’s a wide “activation area”. The Dock unhides when the mouse pointer’s tail has only just disappeared off the bottom of the screen.\nI spend a lot of time in JetBrains IDEs, which have a number of important controls in the status bar at the bottom. Working on Big Sur, the constant unwanted activation of the Dock has become a major irritation. My options are to work in a smaller window, giving up some screen real estate (but then why hide the Dock in the first place?) or to work in full screen mode (but I often need other applications open).\nThere are many lists of hidden Dock preferences available online, so I’m hoping that the width of this activation script might be configurable and not entirely hard-coded.\nEdit: Using Apple's \"Pixie\" app from the \"Additional Tools for Xcode\" package, I've established that the Dock activates as soon as the point of the mouse cursor is in the bottom 20 rows of pixels.\nEdit #2: In macOS 11.4, the size of the activation area has been significantly reduced. It's still more than a single pixel, but it's nowhere near as wide as before. Essentially, this is no longer the real problem it was before — to me, at least.\nEdit #3: Playing with Pixie again, it seems to me that the dock now activates if the focus point of the pointer is in the bottom 4 pixel rows.\n\nA: This is not a real answer.  I am also frustrated by that behaviour but it seems like the scroll bar on some applications can and to avoid BigSur, has to be interacted with above where the actual scroll bar appears to be (ref grg's comment):\n\nAnother none answer is to decrease the dock size to the smallest size so that most of the time it's not in the way:\n\n** edit **\nI've now moved to dock to the left and made the icons bigger again.\n\nA: Another potential \"solution\" is to set the auto-hide time to a large number...

I am starting to realize that I may need my MacBook battery to last longer while I am outside without having any power socket available.\nMy MacBook has a USB-C port used both for charging and for data.\nThere are many USB-C power banks available online, although it seems they are mainly used for phones, but some sellers claim that some of them can be used to charge laptops as well, including a MacBook.\nHow can I determine if a USB-C power bank will actually charge my MacBook, before buying it and testing it, based on the MacBook specs and the power bank specs?\nAnd what is a \"reasonable\" capacity for a power bank used on a Mac (or laptop in general)? For example, is 20000MAh reasonable enough for an \"average\" use for an extra couple of hours, or is it definitely not enough and I need a higher capacity?\nMy MacBook: MacBook 10,1 (Retina, 12-inch, 2017)\nSome examples of power banks online\n\n*\n\n*Link1 (\"Compatible with MacBook Pro\")\n\n*Link2 (According to two different reviews it charges laptops as well)\n\n*Link3 (It says \"for iPhone laptop samsung\")\n\n*Link4 (\"Output for MacBook Nintendo Switch iPhone ...\")\n\n*Link5 (One of the pictures explicitly shows it can charge laptops, and description says it can charge Macbook Air)\n\n*Link6 (Specific for MacBook Pro and quite efficient apparently)\n\n*Link7 (Another charger for laptops)\n\n*Link8 (It says it is also for MacBook)\n\n*Link9 (Same as above)\n\n\nA: If you look at the spec sheet of your MacBook it says that the charger provides up to 29 Watts, which is roughly the maximum power draw the MacBook needs. Now regarding a power bank you would want to have a look at the maximum power [W] output is provided.\nHave a look at this article or this quora post where you will find out that the maximum power over a standard (non PD port) is usually with the 7.5W with for USB 3.0. However power banks may offer a USB-C (USB-A usually doesn't offer this) Power Delivery (PD) port, which theoretically can be certified up to 100W, which for mobile power banks usually is out of reach.\nFrom the links you posted, I think options 1, 6, 7 and 9 would work fine.\n\nTo say how long a certain capacity will help you heavily depends on what you are doing while connected to the power bank. These power banks theoretically have a much higher capacity than the MacBook, yet this charging system has inherent efficiencies. Also, when you charge the MacBook with this power bank the MacBook will think its connected to a wall plug and then apply the according power settings (so make sure to set them appropriately to extend battery life).\nHowever, I would think you could gain up to a complete charge on a 20000mah power bank. Turning off the MacBook and charging it that way is the most efficient way.\n\nSome ideas on how to estimate the power bank endurance.\n\n*\n\n*Install coconutBattery\n\n*Check the power draw at your usual workload\n\nThat will give you an idea how fast/if at all your MacBook can be charged (e.g. the newest MBP 16\" charger can provide up to 100W and at peak power consumption the MBP can nearly reach that).\nCoconut battery also tells you what cycle count your battery is in and how much capacity is left in it. If you then open settings and go to battery (assuming macOS 11.x) you can try to roughly estimate the increased battery life when using a power bank.\n\nA: \nHow can I determine if a USB-C power bank will actually charge my MacBook, before buying it and testing it, based on the MacBook specs and the power bank specs?\n\nApple uses USB-PD for providing power over USB-C so the charger must support USB-PD.  The chargers Apple supplies with their laptops were built to provide enough power to keep the computer running at 100% load indefinitely.  Or at least that's the case most of the time, I do recall reading complaints of people running long overnight CPU intensive processes to discover that their MacBook went to sleep from burning through the battery while plugged in.  That's not how most people use their laptops though.\nI discovered that I could run my MacBook Pro indefinitely from a 27 watt power supply when using it for web surfing and similar light duty work.  This was a 12 volt automotive USB-C charger that I ran from a sealed lead acid battery during an extended power outage at my home.  The computer came with a 61 watt charger, making the 27 watt charger half the size of the original.\nNote that a MacBook will likely be able to take more power than what the included power supply can provide.  This is proven by my MacBook Pro happily taking more than 61 watts from a 87 watt charger I bought as a spare.\nUSB-C chargers will provide 5 volts as well as one or more other voltages, those being 9, 15, and 20 volts.  (Those are nominal, the actual listed voltages could be plus or minus by less than a volt.)  As far as I know Apple laptops will charge from any of those four voltages.  I charged my MacBook Pro from a 5 volt 12 watt USB charger before, v e r y  s l o w l y.\nMy experience shows that, with a sample size of one, that a MacBook Pro will charge from any of the four standard voltages from USB-PD/USB-C.  USB-PD was designed to keep charging amperage between about 1 to 3 amps, going into the 3 to 5 amp range only at 20 volts.  Selecting the power output capability of the battery pack will depend on how quickly you want to charge your computer.  Making notes, mentally or otherwise, on how long it takes for your laptop to charge and comparing that to your needs and preferences should guide you on what output voltage to look for.\nBecause USB-PD specifies a set range for current and voltage the power rating will give some indication of the voltage, and vice versa.  A 27 watt charger like I have will almost definitely provide a maximum of 9 volts.  45 watts likely means 15 volts maximum.  Anything above 45 watts always means 20 volts.\n\nAnd what is a \"reasonable\" capacity for a power bank used on a Mac (or laptop in general)?\n\nThis again depends on your experience, needs, and preferences.  Use the capacity of the battery in your laptop and how many hours of use you get out of it as guidance on how big of a power bank you need.  The capacity of the battery can be found in the System Information app under the Power tab.  Take the mAh, divide that by 1000, and the mV, also divided by 1000, and multiply them together to find the watt-hours (Wh) of your battery.  That will help guide the size of power bank you will want.\nI hate that power banks are often advertised with their mAh ratings as that is useless without knowing the voltage.  Find the Wh capacity of the power bank as that is the number you will care about, the mAh rating is meaningless and should be ignored.  Evaluate how many charge cycles you want or need from your power bank and compare that to the capacity of the battery in your laptop.  If the battery lasts about 4 hours for you on what you consider typical usage, and you think you need 12 hours of use, then get a power bank that is double the size in Wh of your laptop.  That gives 4 hours on the original laptop charge, then two charge cycles from the power bank to get to 12 hours.\nSo, look for USB-PD support on the power bank above everything else.  Without USB-PD the power bank will charge your laptop very slowly at 5 volts or not charge it at all.  I know I spent a lot of words on voltages but it's not terribly important, I gave that detail to explain why it is not important.  It's watts that will tell you how fast it will charge your laptop.  The more watts the less time it will take to charge.  12 watts is likely the absolute minimum, anything below that and your laptop will likely refuse to charge.  Don't be concerned about the power bank being more powerful than the charger that came with your computer, so long as it complies with USB-PD then it will be safe.  Look for capacity in watt-hours, amp-hours and milliamp-hours mean nothing.  Compare the Wh of the power bank to the Wh of the battery in your laptop to estimate how many hours of usage the power bank buys you.\n", "Q: Adding Google Account in Internet Account on Mac Book Pro: Authentication fails On My 2019 Mac Book Pro, under internet accounts, I want to add a google account.

Already searched for some solutions on Google but the only option that I found was to go to Screen Settings on System Preferences and turn on \"Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available\" which it is. However the AirPlay icon doesn't appear in the Menu Bar.\nDoes anyone know how to solve this? Is my MacBook too old to support AirPlay?\n\nA: I have some insights on this subject I want to share, because many don't realize that older Macbooks and iMacs have alder bluetooth and wifi modules.\nThe second factor that goes into play here is HDMI 1.0, 1.1 & 1.2 which are just versions. 1.0 can go up to 1080p, 1.1 can stream up to much higher, and I believe you need a HDMI 1.2 capable device to display 4k and such.\nThe point of HDMI versions is often overlooked, but describes the MAX-output your monitor can support. I have HDMI 1.0, and an Apple TV (2) that supports up to 1080p.\nCheck what kind of resolution your monitor support, check the version of your HDMI cable, and check the resolution of your Mac's monitor. If you see the obvious \"out of bounds resolution\" in either of these devices, this is why it can not make that bridge to steam the resolution to begin with.\nThese can only process certain bandwiths and speeds, like the wifi modules only pick up 2,5ghz, and use 300MB (I believe), not the 1200MB on 5ghz.\nSo my iMac 2010 can stream to a device, but only up to 1080p, which my TV will support since the Apple TV reaches it's MAX, and the TV too. Done.\nBut it will not mirror my desktop to my TV, since it uses a higher resolution that the AppleTV or the TV itself will support. This doesn't stop me however.\nYou change your monitor's resolution in the display settings right? Try that and match the resolution to your streaming devices and monitor's MAX resolution.\nBut I tried it and it doesn't yield the result you want; to stream your desktop.\nFunny enough it does work on a 21,5\" iMac 2011 or 2010; they both have a native-resolution of 1080p and will stream without problems. But Apple capped the 27\" probably because that way you \"need\" a better device.\nAirplay also doesn't show in the menu-bar, and I'm on an iMac 27\" that has a resolution of 2560x1440. But it does detect AirPlay in Quicktime and other apps that use it's functionality natively.\nSimply click the \"share\" icon in Quicktime when you're playing a movie, and you'll see that you can actually stream to your AppleTV if the resolution of the movie can actually fit on it.\nSo in short; you can download a 1080p video clip, and a 2k video clip in .mov format, open them with Quicktime, stream them to your device, and see if my science sticks or makes you sick about Apple's practices, too.\nThe 21,5\" has the same WiFi and Bluetooth specs as the 27\", so it's capped by native resolution, not by actual display resolution set by the user agent.\nYet the internal resolution is also MAX 1080p which is why it did show the menu-bar icon on a 21,5\" iMac, but not mine; the 27\" 2560 x 1440 MAX resolution (out of bounds of 1080p) natively to stream.\nBecause I just use Quicktime to stream certain content, your desktop will not  since the content is on top of it, and thus is a much higher resolution to stream than your HDMI or AppleTV version can handle.\nPlain & simple. AirPlay works with a native resolution that it can support from start to finish by the compounded effect of all it's parts. One on one.\n\nA: The second reason why you cannot use AirPlay on some of the 2011 models is for the size of their GPU memory. You can check how much your GPU has by clicking on the Apple icon in the top-left of your menu-bar and clicking \"About this Mac\", then select the tab display.\nMine has the 2GB AMD 6XXX series, but some from 2010 have the AMD 5XXX model with only 512MB. That's enough for one display of 2560 x 1440, but not more.\nI know this for certain because I sold the one I had for exactly that specific reason; it has only support for 1 monitor due to the lack of memory to support another.\n", "Q: Help with an AppleScript - click a menu item which has a name which changes I'd like to make F5 be equivalent to clicking on the mail icon in the taskbar, and F6 equivalent to clicking minimise on the mail app main window (or the 'hide' action).

A crash is reported practically any time a file changes remotely on Google Drive and has to be synced to the local Google Drive folder.\nToday I discovered that 7 copies of FinderSyncAPIExtension were running, all related to Google Backup and Sync:\n/Applications/Backup and Sync.app/Contents/PlugIns/FinderSyncAPIExtension.appex/Contents/MacOS/FinderSyncAPIExtension\n\nI killed all of them with the command:\nkillall -9 FinderSyncAPIExtension\n\nAfter this, I expected one new instance to be automatically launched but none were. Even so, changes on Google Drive continued to be synced to my local folder, and changes to the local folder were synced to Google Drive. And there have been no crashes (so far).\nI am unsure what functionality this extension is supposed to provide, but it may not be essential.\n", "Q: Unable to install git using homebrew I am trying to install git using homebrew:\nbrew install git\nTerminal reads:\n\n==> Searching for similarly named formulae...

My wife has a 2017 MBP and after upgrading her OS to Big Sur, the laptop has become dog slow. It takes literally seconds for a new program or browser tab to open. The OS should be called 'Big Slow'.\nAnyway, I thought I might try erase her HD and reinstall the OS, but we have some concerns.\nWe want to ONLY reinstall the OS. We do not want to lose any data and we do not want to have to reinstall any applications. She does regular Time Machine backups.\nThere are a lot of posts with the same question I have here, but for whatever reason, they all ignore the question about applications... so I am asking again.\n\n*\n\n*Will using the 'reinstall OS' option result in DATA being removed?\n\n*Will using the 'reinstall OS' option result in APPLICATIONS being\nremoved?\n\n*Must we reinstall the OS and then restore from the Time\nMachine backup, or a simple 'reinstall OS' is enough?\n\nThanks\n\nA: This is an answer to the question as asked, but I suspect further investigation will be necessary.\nReinstalling the OS without removing existing detritus will quite likely return you to the exact same state.\nReinstall from Recovery without erase will clean up the OS itself without affecting any other data/apps. If the OS itself was at issue, then it will fix the OS. It will not fix anything user-installed that is slowing the OS down.\nErasing then installing from scratch then migrating in from Time Machine will return you to the Mac as you last had it.

I was recording a Zoom meeting and it suddenly stopped, because my hard-drive was full due to iCloud-Drive downloads. I now have to remove these downloads every time to free up disk space.\nHow can I make iCloud stop downloading files in the background?\n\nA: Right click the file in iCloud Drive, the one you don't need. then, click remove download. this will free up space on your Mac and keep the file in iCloud, where you can download at any time by double clicking it.\n\nA: Can only click \"remove download\" after the HUGE download finished.

I have a Macbook air 2015 with 128 GB storage and I just upgraded from Yosemite to Mojave. Surprisingly, after upgrade to Mojave, the amount of storage I had left went from 36 to 46 GB.\nSo my question is, if I update to Catalina or Big Sur, will this free up even more space or will it consume more?\n\nA: Normally, one OS update replaces the file contents of the previous one. While there might be some small variation in size between OS versions, I would not expect an additional 10 GB to get used up.\nHowever, some space will be needed to download the new OS installer before it is launched.\nI would install the OS, and then check how much space you have. There are disk utilities like OmniDiskSweeper that sort your whole drive by size, showing you exactly what is taking up the space and letting you delete it, if that is advisable.\nYou may also want to check if you have any backups of iPhones or iPads saved to your Mac, as these can take up large amounts of space.\n\nA: You should not have an issue upgrading to Catalina nor Big Sur. However, you should upgrade the storage to at Leary 256GB / 480Gb or 512GB. Depending on your budget. 128GB is not going to leave much room for Apps and data.\nThat model MacBook Air has an SSD you can replace. Otherworld Computing sells kits that include an SSD, screwdriver (pentalobe) and a USB3 external case for your old drive. Then you can clone the old drive to the new one and expand the volume to fill the disk. You could have a shop do this for you. You could buy the parts elsewhere. Fact is it’s doable. Plenty of options. OWC may not be the cheapest but they provide everything you need and tech support plus video guides. It’s not that hard. You remove the screws from the back. Make sure you remember where each screw goes as they are not all the same length. Then it’s just one screw to remove the SSD. Put the old SSD into an external case. SuperDuper or Carbon Disk Cloner can duplicate the old drive to the new drive and expand it to give maximum capacity.\n", "Q: M1 Mac (in DEP) first created user has no Secure Token I have an M1 Mac that is in DEP (using Jamf). If I wipe the machine (from within Recovery Mode) and reinstall Big Sur 11.1, the first created user does not have a Secure Token, and so I can not enable FileVault.\nLooking on the web I have found people who had similar issues, but the general solution seems to be \"wipe the machine and reinstall macOS, and you're all good\", which is exactly what I am doing.\nSee this one as an example: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8487253\nThe best description of Secure Tokens (I am including the link because otherwise everyone else will point me there) is here: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/secure-token-and-filevault-on-apple-file-system/\nIt looks like a bug in the OS - the initial created user has no Secure Token, and so I can not give any other users a Secure Token. Therefore I guess I am not allowed to use FileVault?\n\nA: After much experimentation, it looks like the way to do this is to go to Recovery mode, and \"Erase this Mac\". I also used \"Deactivate this Mac\", but I am not sure if this helped or not.\nAfter erasing the machine, and then reformatting and reinstalling (the classic nuke and pave), when macOS finished installing the single user on the system DID have a Secure Token, and I was able to enable FileVault.\nIt really shouldn't be this difficult, though.\n", "Q: What kind of adapter do I need to connect this external monitor?

What kind of adapter would I need to connect this type of monitor?\n\nA: If you register your Mac with iCloud / AppleID and then use the iOS Apple Store app - it shows compatible adapters.

In my searching, it appears that escaping apostrophes in script is really, really tricky to get right.  I've tried numerous approaches (heredoc, multiple -e lines, quoted form of, etc.) but so far I haven't been able to get any to work.

Running an older macOS 10.x on the new Apple M1 processor with macOS 11.x as a host to a macOS 10.x virtual machine guest is likely to be possible soon.  I've been using macOS as a host to a number of different operating systems for some time and there's a lot of good software for this.  But what I'm doing is more accurately called virtualization, I'm creating an instance of a x86-64 processor that runs on an x86-64 processor for this guest operating system to run on.  There are hardware \"hooks\" in the instruction set to aid this and improve performance.  Most virtual machine software requires the host and guest to use the same instruction set to work.  Some require more from the host processor in having these virtualization \"hooks\" to hold on to in order to aid in speed, stability, and features.\nApple made the M1 with these virtualization \"hooks\" to aid in creating ARM virtual processors for running versions of Windows and Linux written for ARM.  This would at best allow a guest instance of macOS \"Big Sur\" on macOS \"Big Sur\"\nThere are emulators in progress that will allow an ARM based host to have a x86 guest.  These will not have the same kind of performance as a like-on-like processor virtualization.  Apple knew that there would be a period of time where people would need to run x86 software on their new M1 processor so there are \"hooks\" on the M1 to aid this as well.  This is intended to help run software written for macOS on x86 to work on macOS on ARM.  Software for x86 that does not require the x86 hardware virtualization \"hooks\" might be able to run but that means the emulated x86 will be lacking in some way.  This would be something like VirtualBox with the emulator mode instead of virtualization mode running on Rosetta2 to run a VM.\nI recall seeing people install Windows and Linux on M1 \"metal\" with some success.  It may be possible for these to run an x86 emulator that can host an older macOS x86 guest machine.\nThere has to be a number of ways to put an emulation layer on the M1 so that some version of x86 macOS can run.  The options I'm seeing is some M1 native OS, macOS 11, Windows for ARM, or Linux for ARM, being a host to some x86 emulator, Bochs, VirtualBox, or whatever.  But these are all in early development and will not be stable enough for some time.  Because this means running an OS on top of an OS there will be penalties for memory, storage, and speed.  Given some reports on some attempts to do this there is a potential that such penalties will be barely noticed.\nIf this is possible now then it's going to be buggy and slow.  In time I expect this to be popular among developers, enthusiasts, gamers, and retro-computing types.\nBecause of how things like this work there may be a working emulator for PowerPC macOS available for M1 before there is any x86 macOS emulator for M1.  What does anyone think of running Snow Leopard?  Then run VirtualPC to host macOS for intel?\n\nA: Short answer:\nno\nLong answer:\nno.\nM1 uses a different type of technology that intel chips use. macOS Catalina is designed for only intel chips and only that. basically, the M1 chip speaks a different language than macOS Catalina. macOS big sur speaks a launguage understandable by intel chips and the M1.\n\nA: That is a good question, not sure the answer is \"No, you can not\". Moreover, I am rather positive the answer is \"yes, you can do that\".\nThis is an old story. Catalina macmini users were unhappy with their computers SHIPPED with Catalina, they preferred Mojave.\nhttps://scriptingosx.com/2020/01/downgrading-a-mac-that-shipped-with-catalina-to-mojave/\nIf you are familiar with Apple, you know they are always overcareful about security, and they boost it by, essentially, restricting your choices. Try to uninstall safari, for instance, or any in-build app. The same goes for the OS itself.\nBy the way, Apple has removed some of its requirements in Big Sur, but this faced a criticism by security enthusiasts like Patrick Wardle https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1327726496203476992?lang=en\n", "Q: Are passwords in my keychain readable by enterprises MDM tools? So, our company is starting to push MDM (VMWare Workstation One) around... I understand they want to be safe... But I'm worried about my safety.\nQuestion: Is my keychain still safe after MDM is pushed to my macbook?\n\nA: You should not be installing work-issued MDM solutions on a personal computer, and you should not keep personal content on a work computer unless you are okay with IT management at the company accessing it. Assume they have the same permissions as an administrator account with screen sharing enabled.\nTo answer your question, your keychain is protected by your account login password in most cases. In the \"assume they have an administrator account\" scenario, that does not give them access. However, they probably also have your account password accessible if they use any sort of managed login system (my work requires enterprise passwords to be used for machine accounts) which would allow access.\n", "Q: Does iOS hide your Wifi SSID information from your apps? I recently asked a very similar question for Android, where it is a serious concern that any app can record what Wifi SSID you've connected to.\nThere are these Google, SkyHook, and Apple SSID databases that allow anyone to know which ssid is located where, and the info can be leaked by your neighbour not just your usual devices on your own router.\nTo quote:\n\nThis means that even if you are on a VPN, even if you turn off wifi\nscanning, even if you turn off location services and take out your sim\ncard, even if you stop broadcasting your router's wifi SSID, your apps\nwill be able to know what wifi SSID you are currently on.\nThis means that an attacker (read: the surveillance capitalism :) ),\ncan figure out if/when I am home, and which other devices that\nare/were online have used the same SSID. E.g. all my family's\n(mandatory) banking apps will know where my family members congregate,\nand could change my insurance score, or other \"insert dystopian\nscenario here\".\nConsidering what I described, I don't think there is any wiggle room\nfor you to ever hide your real location from a bad (state, corp,\nhacker) actor. Am I wrong? Can I hide my SSID from the apps that are\non my phone?\n\nIs this also how iOS works? I'm aware Apple itself knows what wifi and what color underewear all of your family members are wearing, and that it is selling (yes, sells less data than others but still also sells data) or otherwise using conclusions from analyzing that data and then sending/selling, to other services and/or third parties. But, does it technically allow apps to build this kind of explicit connected device (e.g. SSID) history?\nAlso, (since I'm less familiar with iOS) is there a feature where your iPhone constantly scans all devices around you (wifi and bluetooth) to improve location or other features? And if so, which specific device names ever end up being visible to your apps? (and how to prevent that)\n\nA: As of iOS 5, Apple removed the public API for scanning networks.\nAs of iOS 7, Apple removed the ability of apps to access the MAC address of the user device.\nAs of iOS 11, apps can no longer access the MAC addresses of devices on the same Wi-Fi network.\nAs of iOS 13, apps require explicit access permission to Location, granted by the user, to obtain access to the name (SSID) and MAC address of the connected AP.\nAs of iOS 14, apps require explicit access permission to a new Local Network control, granted by the user, to find and communicate with devices on your local network, and:\n\nOnly apps that have already been granted user permission to access precise location data, that have been given permission to set up a virtual private network profile, or that have been given permission to configure a network on the system on the user’s behalf will be able to see the names of Wi-Fi networks the user is connected to.\n\nP.S. The question as currently phrased reflects a misunderstanding of Apple's privacy policies and practices.\n", "Q: Ipad 3 cover not deactivating screen My iPad 3 with the original apple cover seems to stay turned on (display is on) when the cover is closed.

How do I find \"Unlock\"?\n\nA: Android devices require a driver/app install - they will not natively hook up to a Mac.\nGoogle provides Android File Transfer for this task.\n\nA: I am using samsung galaxy s10 and they seem to have an app for transferring: Samsung smart switch. Roll down to the bottom of the page to get the macOS version. During or after installing you need to go to \"Security&Privacy\" in macbook \"setting\", on the page \"general\", unlock first, and then you will see the button shows up at the bottom.

Right now I can right click the link, pick services from the context menu, and then select my service. I'd rather not navigate the menu. Is there a way I can harness Click when making a shortcut?\nA half-option is to right click the link, click elsewhere to close the dialog, and then press the keyboard shortcut, but this is cumbersome.

Both talked perfectly to each other - both are running 10.15.7\nThe Mac mini has an external USB drive called Media 2, and I could mount and use it over the network via the MBP.\nToday I installed a GbE switch so that both Macs can talk to the GbE port on the router, and now I can't mount the Media 2 drive on the MBP any more. Everything else works, it's just that external USB drive that I can't mount on the MBP over the network.\nI get this box every time:\n\nI can connect to the Mac mini using screen sharing and access Media 2 on the MBP that way. While I'm screen sharing the mini via the MBP, I can copy from Media 2 to the MBP. I just can't mount Media 2 directly on the MBP.\nI've Googled around, and the most common solutions - restart the Finder or log out/back in - haven't worked.\nAny suggestions gratefully received!\n\nA: It fixed itself after 3 days.

Is it possible for me to connect a Mac mini to my MacBook Pro, and then use the Mac mini as a docking station?\nMy idea is to plug in an Ethernet cable, an SD card, some USB devices, and a FireWire device into the 2012 Mac mini and have it all show up on my MacBook Pro.\nIdeally I would also be able to plug in a display via HDMI as well as audio devices (headphones/microphone) into the Mac mini and be able to use them on my MacBook Pro.\nI plan on connecting the Mac mini to my MacBook Pro via a Thunderbolt 2 cable.\nThe reason for this odd question is because a used 2012 Mac mini is actually cheaper than buying a used Thunderbolt 2 docking station. On top of that, the Mac mini offers even more connectivity (e.g. and SD card slot) than many of the old Thunderbolt 2 docks.\nNote: I could just use the Mac mini as my main computer and use the devices directly. However, my question is focused on wether I can essentially replace a Thunderbolt 2 docking station with this Mac mini somehow. Perhaps this could be done with a program which \"forwards\" data and video through the Thunderbolt 2 port of the Mac mini?\n\nA: The concept is nice.  But you can't connect a Mac mini to the MacBook Pro and have the mini act like a docking station.\nNevertheless you can enable file sharing on the Mac mini and all directly connected storage devices (USB, Firewire, SD) become available to the MacBook Pro via SMB networking.\nOther devices can't be accessed as if the Mac mini were a docking station.  That would include the audio port, non-storage USB/Firewire devices and HDMI.  I don't know of any software solutions which enable this.\nOther things you might consider:\nScreensharing allows you to show the desktop (and use the mouse and keyboard) from one computer to the other.  And there are better performing products (e.g. Jump Desktop) than the inbuilt screen sharing.\nYou can find software that will enable the mini's screen to act as an extension to the MacBook Pro's screen.  My limited experience with this has not been very successful.\n", "Q: How can you open a video on your desktop at a specific time using terminal?

Can people buy 256 SSD Mac Mini M1 and upgrade it later, or can't upgrade it like memory?\n\nA: Both the memory and the SDD are not upgradable. Storage can be expanded by adding an external drive. Apple specifications state the internal drive has speeds up to 3.4 GB/s. Samsung specifications state the X5 Thunderbolt 3 SSD has speeds up to 2.8 GB/s. So storage can be expanded by adding an external Samsung X5 drive, albeit at a 18% drop in speed.\nI am using a 2018 Mac mini with a 256 GB internal SSD. I quickly learned this was not enough storage. A 500 GB Samsung X5 SSD was added. The Mac was configured so macOS resided on the internal drive while the each user's home folder resided on the Samsung X5 drive. This allowed macOS to operate a maximum speed, while there was sight drop in speed when accessing user files.\n\nNote: The Samsung X5 drive has TRIM support when used with macOS.\n\nI should point out that at the time of purchase you can upgrade the 2020 Mac mini to an internal 1 TB SSD for $400. Samsung's list price for a 1 TB X5 SSD is also $400.\nA user's home folder location can be set from the User & Groups pane of the System Preferences application. See the article Move Your Mac's Home Folder to a New Location.\n\nUpdate\nThere also exists the possibility of using an internal SSD placed in a drive enclosure. When choosing the drive and enclosure consider the following.\n\n*\n\n*The drive should be a using a interface that is faster than legacy SATA, which has a maximum transfer rate of 6 Gb/s. Most (if not all) NVMe SSDs can transfer data at significantly higher rates.\n\n\n*The enclosure should be Thunderbolt 3 or USB 4 (Thunderbolt 4) compatible. In other words, having a transfer rate of 40 Gb/s. Note: USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 enclosures, which are designed to operate at a maximum transfer rate of 20 Gb/s, will only operate at a maximum of 10 Gb/s when plugged into your Mac.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, storage is soldered in for the current Mac minis, so it may be worthwhile to choose wisely when purchasing.\nAlthough, with Thunderbolt 3, in all but the most demanding applications, an external drive would work fine.\n", "Q: Software updating programs builtin to macOS Big Sur What software updating programs are builtin to macOS Big Sur?\nI already know about the following GUI applications:\n\n*\n\n*App Store\n\n*Software Update (GUI for Software Update)\n\nI already know about the following Terminal executables:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/bin/cpan* (e.g., cpan, cpan5.18, etc.)\n\n*/usr/bin/gem\n\n*/usr/bin/pip3\n\n*/usr/sbin/softwareupdate (Terminal executable for Software Update)\n\nWhat additional software that is builtin to macOS can be run to update software?\nTo get pedantic, let's consider as a builtin software updating program any file in a fresh Big Sur install whose path can eventually be made to point to a file that that is a software updating program through a process that the original file at that path somehow mentions or actuates. e.g., the initial file at /usr/bin/pip3 isn't a pip3 executable; it only outputs instructions about how to change that path (/usr/bin/pip3) to point to an actual pip3 executable.\n\nA: There is no mechanism in macOS to keep all software up to date.  So you need to consider other mechanisms.\nMy list:\n\n*\n\n*Obviously the Apple App Store.\n\n\n*Mac Updater alerts me (and helps install) updates to nearly all the apps I have installed.  This is the biggest improvement to app updating I have come across for a long time.\n\n\n*To check on the state of Apple macOS updates (particularly firmware,\nGatekeeper, XProtect, etc.) I find Silent Knight to be invaluable.

And users of other package managers will need to use their update methods.\n\n\n*Adobe users find it hard to avoid the Adobe (Creative Cloud) updater - it is somewhat intrusive in my view.\n\nA: macOS is designed to prompt users to update as needed. Most users do not need to manually update their system or included software. See Apple's How to update the software on your Mac for authoritative advice:\n\nUse Software Update to find and install updates for macOS, built-in apps like Safari, and apps downloaded from the App Store.\n\nTo further simplify applying updates, Apple recommends enabling Automatically keep my Mac up to date. in the Software Update settings.\n", "Q: How to keep mac awake while updating I am upgrading from mojave to big sur and need to know how to keep my mac awake during this time. the terminal command caffeinate did not work, after some time the screen display went blank as usual.

I thought I only had 16 gb ram on this machine so figured it would be fine on the macbook as this machine is running fine for me. Now that I've realized I actually have 24 GB ram, and you can't upgrade MacBooks afterwards, I'm starting to get worried I won't have enough on the MacBook.

Or will I be ok with 16?\nThanks!\n\nA: I program in 8 GB and run light virtual machines and docker. You’d only need 16 or more for very specific cases. The new OS take less ram since Apple is dropping all the 32 bit frameworks and libraries. In general 3rd party apps are slimming faster than they are growing now as well, but with M1 and Intel, apps will be larger for a short term but that doesn’t really affect RAM at all, just disk space and network time to download.\nYou can compile LLVM from first principles on a 2015 MacBook or 2016 MacBook Air, so seriously large and complicated builds don’t require exotic hardware anymore.\nThe only cases for large RAM are massive browser needs and several VM for more than light testing.\n\nA: Apple has been getting really smart in managing its memory usage over the years.\nFor what you're doing, you should be just fine with 16GB as a minimum.\nAnything more is just a bonus.\n", "Q: Boot Camp error \"Windows cannot locate the disk and partition\" I have a 2019 MacBook Pro 16 inch running on macOS Big Sur 11.1.\nI am trying to install windows using Bootcamp.

So far, I've been unable to complete a single TM backup to the Synology.\nThe main problem is that the backup always stops after backing up only a few tens or hundreds of megabytes, usually with no errors in the Time Machine preferences pane or in the Console, but very occasionally with a \"Could not complete backup\" notification.\nI've tried doing a new backup from scratch, and I've tried seeding a backup from my last good sparsebundle file on my previous backup disk (after fsck-ing it for errors). I've tried over SMB, and I've tried over AFP (which I've now turned off again, as I know it's deprecated and generally doesn't play too well with Synology).\nCurrently, I'm running a cron job on my Mac that runs 'tmutil startbackup' every 5 minutes. This is my second attempt at that—the first time, it nearly got to the end after a couple of days, but then the \"amount remaining to backup\" just kept increasing faster than it was backing up, so that backup never finished either. (I don't think that's a Synology problem, though—seems to be a known issue when using TM with a NAS, though I don't know how to solve that either.)\nCan anyone suggest anything to make this less painful, and preferably, Just Work?\n\nA: New information has come to light. The Mac may need directory repair, significant space freed or just an erase install based on multiple clean Time Machine starts failing.\n\nIt’s hard to pick apart backup issues with such a custom setup.\nI recommend you start with the “nurse” procedure at the bottom of my answer - working up to fsck and safe boot as appropriate. Exclude three folders and let a minimal backup complete. Consider throwing away the old backups and starting with a clean slate, no restrictions or fancy settings - let Time Machine think it can use the entire disk.\n/Users\n/Library\n/System\n\nIf the interface asks to skip all system files, say yes. Once you have hourly backups going well. Remove things from the exclusion one by one and focus on disk corruption on the source if that’s where the backups hang.\nAlso, disable cron forcing things while stability is not present. Let the normal triggers work until you’re solid is my advice. Also, The Time Machine Mechanic and Backup Loupe are invaluable tools for me working on problematic Time Machine situations. Yours seems overly not easy, so something is causing you pain that hopefully can be identified and remedied.\n", "Q: Devanagari text not shown in 2007 ipod Classic 160 gb I have a 2007 iPod Classic (160 gb).

It’s an iCloud library with roughly 120,000 photos, and was set to only store optimized images locally.  Catalina 10.15.7, with plenty of free space.\nMy Mac was repaired under AppleCare, including replacing the logic board, which replaced the SSD.  I restored from my Time Machine backup without incident, other than Photos wouldn’t launch.  The window opened with “Restoring… 0% complete” and never stopped.  (Not “Restoring from iCloud” which I know is a message that can also appear).  After several hours with no progress, I killed the app.  My photos are in iCloud, and work fine on other devices so I figured I’d just create a new local library and re-sync from iCloud.  I’ve been unable to do so.\nWhat I do:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new empty library and set it to be Primary.  Photos freezes\n(spins) when I press that Primary button.  Location of that library\nis irrelevant (tried both default and non-default location)\n\n*Once I\nkill Photos, I relaunch, and it shows “Restoring… 0%” and never makes\nprogress.  Photos, along with the related daemons (photolibraryd,\nphotoalanlysd, and cloudphotod) remain at 0%.\n\nSteps I’ve tried multiple times in various combinations:\n\n*\n\n*Delete the Photos library\n\n*Delete Photos preferences, at least all I can find\n\n*Turn off iCloud->Photos in system preferences\n\n*Reboot\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I solved this with the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Restart in Safe Mode (Shift key held down).\n\n*Attached an external drive containing a clone I’d made the same day as the Time Machine backup.

It seems iPhone (and iPad) actually has a standard feature that is called external GPS device?\nI hope to find out more about it:\n\n*\n\n*First of all, why would we use an external GPS device?  I can understand if it is wireless-only iPad, then it has no GPS hardware and it is \"best guessed by wireless\", so an external GPS device can help, but what about for iPhone -- why do we need it?\n\n\n*If it is external GPS device, is it by BlueTooth only?  Can it be by WiFi, or by lightning connector, USB-C if it is iPad Pro, or possibly, another other method? (such as using the Internet to pass the location to iPhone, instead of BlueTooth?)\n\n\n*Does it in general work for iPhone and iPad both?\n\n\n*So the device can also move around from the true GPS location, such as for whatever reason, simulate a location that is 20 feet away? Or even to 50 miles away? What are some examples of such devices?\nThe question is to understand about \"external GPS devices\", which I never knew is actually a standard feature for the iPhone / iPad.\n\nA: Per specs, only iPads with cellular modems have GPS hardware built in—where by definition all iPhones will have it.\nThere's a discussion thread in Apple communities that appears well-sourced with a few links to more information.\nSpeaking from experience, full-fledged GPS in an iOS device WILL drain battery quite quickly—due to the need for satellite tracking. That can be an unwelcome surprise in the wilderness—and something dedicated GPS devices may be better suited for.\nAnother example is aviation-use iPads in the cockpit for management/flight planning, where external GPS devices run the risk of interfering with the aircraft's installed GPS transceivers.\n", "Q: Worthwhile replacing battery of 1st generation iPhone SE? I am considering replacing the battery in my iPhone SE. It drops from 70% charge at room temperature to 10% charge in the outdoor winter cold, then shuts off, leaving me stranded without connectivity.\nWhen I bought the phone several years ago, there was a high profile problem where iOS upgrades would slow the clocks on older phones to make up for the short battery life.  Due to public outcry, Apple agreed to replace the battery for free.  Since I don't use the phone much, I didn't take advantage of that offer initially, and when I decided to, it was too late.\nIf I replace the battery now, it would likely cost under $100, including tax (about 12% here).  It is a 1st generation iPhone SE [1], however, and I'm not sure how able it will be to host many more iOS upgrades.  At some point, Apple will not allow upgrades in order to avoid untenable customer experiences.\nFor those who have visibility into the technology trend, how likely is it that in the next year, the growing procesing/memory demands of iOS upgrades will make them unsupportable by 1st generation iPhone SEs?\nI hardly use the phone (not allowed to have one at work, don't need it at home), so the $150/year of amortized phone cost seems...OK, I suppose.  When I need it, however, I really need it, e.g., navigating a new city, looking up things or communicating when doing milk run activities.\nI suppose that it's not the end of the world to be stuck without iOS upgrades, but I anticipate running into problems with web apps and webpage compatibility, as well as stale security.\n[1] Model MP822VC/A\n\nA: Generally, Apple supports iPhones for seven years—so going from the date it was discontinued in 2018, would give a window of support until 2025. Sometimes, due to specific hardware being able to run later versions of iOS, it may be possible to go beyond that point, but is a gamble.\nIf you're looking at extending the value, the $100 cost looks like a good deal—as long as you don't need the latest-and-greatest. Keep in mind, though, that the proliferation of 5G networks and changing carrier support may factor into your decision.\n\nA: While not certain, rumours do seem to suggest that the SE will not make the cut for iOS 15.\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/21/ios-15-will-cut-support-for-iphone-6s-and-original-iphone-se-report-claims\n", "Q: macOS NO new file here, advantages? On macOS Finder we don't have a new file here by default. So they created it somewhere else (https://langui.net/new-file-here/) and people have to pay extra for that.\nIn principle it seems to me a new file here is a good thing to have. But many times apple cut stuff out, and then we notice we actually don't need it.\nI trying to understand if that idea is being applied to the missing new file here case.\nHowever I'm having a hard time to understand the benefits of not having a new file here.\nWhat are the advantages of not having a new file here?\n\nA: This is likely to get closed as opinion-based, but I'd ask \"What's the perceived benefit of being able to create a blank file to then have to open it in a separate action?\"\nWhy not just generate new files in the application you're going to use them in?\nYou can, if you need for arcane or esoteric purposes, easily create a blank file in Terminal with touch.\n", "Q: itunes on PC autofills music on iphone 7 despite option settings itunes keeps autofill music on my iphone 7.  I have \"manually manage music\" checked device summary page in itunes & the \"prevent ipods, iphones, &ipads from syncing automatically\" option check in device preferences. However when I delete songs from the iphone itunes will start automatically coping / autofilling songs to the iphone. I'd like this to stop so that I can delete a bunch of songs then manually add new ones I want. Seems like itunes isn't looking at/obeying/caring about settings.\nIt looks like itunes wants to fill in \"missing\" songs on the iphone i.e. the songs with gray dotted circles in the left hand column. I'd like it NOT to do this automagically. What else do I need to do to not have it do this?  I could delete them on the iphones but I'd like to see which ones are missing before I do that.\nIs there a solution for this?\n\nA: If you set the Summary page in to 'Manually manage'\n\nand then also Enable sync and select 'Selected playlists…' then an option appears to automatically fill free space with songs.\n\nThese options are all very interactive so you don't necessarily see them all at the same time.\n", "Q: Is there a way to put a button in the home app (in Catalina) on the desktop? I would like quick access to a home app button either in the dock or on the desktop.\nI tried dragging a button to the desktop.  I explored the menus.  I cannot find a way to do it.\nIt would also be nice if there was also an option for home controls in Mojave (though I know the Home app is Catalina+ only), but the button I'd like to use is for controlling my KVM setup (I still use a 32 bit app on a Mac Mini running Mojave).  But at least getting from the Catalina Mac to the Mojave Mac would be convenient.\nWays I currently can switch: Siri command, Home.app, Node-RED, and manually switching the 4 devices involved in my setup that the 2 computers share (USB switch, HDMI switch, Stereo connection, TV's HDMI channel).\n\nA: Yes.  If you have Node-RED running on a Mac or Raspberry Pi, you can save a simple AppleScript, such as the one below, as an application:\nset webhookurl to \"http://raspberrypi.local:1880/smartplugon\"\nset shellTxt to \"curl -X GET \" & \" \\\"\" & webhookurl & \"\\\" > /dev/null\"\ndo shell script shellTxt\n\nwhich can make a simple webhook call to your Node-RED instance, anytime you run it.  Node-RED can be set to listen on a URL such as the one above which watches for calls to a location you name, e.g. smartplugon (which you define in a Node-RED workflow using an http in node).\nThen, by installing node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged in Node-RED, you can link Node-RED to Siri.  The nodes you create using that homekit-bridged node will show up on your phone, and can receive on/off commands via the webhook call (which is, as in this case, called by the applescript application we made above).  You then connect the homekit-bridged node to a device-specific node, such as a WeMo node, which actually issues the on/off command to the device.\nNote, this does not work with an Apple home pod or an iPad.  But, you can transfer all of your smart devices to Node-RED and use it as your hub.  Then you can do much more than what the Apple ecosystem allows.\nHere's an example of the workflow to receive the webhook call and turn on a smart plug (the actual smartplug control is not included, so all this does is change the button status on your phone - adding the device controls is left to you):\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": \"2eeb6d1c.b427aa\",\n        \"type\": \"tab\",\n        \"label\": \"home example\",\n        \"disabled\": false,\n        \"info\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"dfce471f.cf9df8\",\n        \"type\": \"http in\",\n        \"z\": \"2eeb6d1c.b427aa\",\n        \"name\": \"Smart Plug On\",\n        \"url\": \"/smartplugon\",\n        \"method\": \"get\",\n        \"upload\": false,\n        \"swaggerDoc\": \"\",\n        \"x\": 310,\n        \"y\": 180,\n        \"wires\": [\n            [\n                \"6c1cc05b.d47088\",\n                \"18cbf86.372f988\"\n            ]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"6c1cc05b.d47088\",\n        \"type\": \"http response\",\n        \"z\": \"2eeb6d1c.b427aa\",\n        \"name\": \"Response\",\n        \"statusCode\": \"200\",\n        \"headers\": {},\n        \"x\": 470,\n        \"y\": 160,\n        \"wires\": []\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"18cbf86.372f988\",\n        \"type\": \"template\",\n        \"z\": \"2eeb6d1c.b427aa\",\n        \"name\": \"On\",\n        \"field\": \"payload\",\n        \"fieldType\": \"msg\",\n        \"format\": \"handlebars\",\n        \"syntax\": \"plain\",\n        \"template\": \"{\\\"On\\\":true}\",\n        \"output\": \"json\",\n        \"x\": 450,\n        \"y\": 200,\n        \"wires\": [\n            [\n                \"645fcc0c.a3cc84\"\n            ]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"645fcc0c.a3cc84\",\n        \"type\": \"homekit-service\",\n        \"z\": \"2eeb6d1c.b427aa\",\n        \"isParent\": true,\n        \"bridge\": \"f2691ed1.345838\",\n        \"parentService\": \"\",\n        \"name\": \"Smart Plug\",\n        \"serviceName\": \"Outlet\",\n        \"topic\": \"\",\n        \"filter\": false,\n        \"manufacturer\": \"Default Manufacturer\",\n        \"model\": \"Default Model\",\n        \"serialNo\": \"0001\",\n        \"cameraConfigVideoProcessor\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigSource\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigStillImageSource\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigMaxStreams\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigMaxWidth\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigMaxHeight\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigMaxFPS\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigMaxBitrate\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigVideoCodec\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigAudioCodec\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigAudio\": false,\n        \"cameraConfigPacketSize\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigVerticalFlip\": false,\n        \"cameraConfigHorizontalFlip\": false,\n        \"cameraConfigMapVideo\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigMapAudio\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigVideoFilter\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigAdditionalCommandLine\": \"\",\n        \"cameraConfigDebug\": false,\n        \"cameraConfigInterfaceName\": \"\",\n        \"characteristicProperties\": \"{\\\"On\\\":true}\",\n        \"x\": 590,\n        \"y\": 200,\n        \"wires\": [\n            [],\n            []\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"f2691ed1.345838\",\n        \"type\": \"homekit-bridge\",\n        \"z\": \"\",\n        \"bridgeName\": \"NodeRED HomeKitD\",\n        \"pinCode\": \"111-11-111\",\n        \"port\": \"\",\n        \"allowInsecureRequest\": false,\n        \"manufacturer\": \"Default Manufacturer\",\n        \"model\": \"Default Model\",\n        \"serialNo\": \"Default Serial Number\",\n        \"customMdnsConfig\": false,\n        \"mdnsMulticast\": true,\n        \"mdnsInterface\": \"\",\n        \"mdnsPort\": \"\",\n        \"mdnsIp\": \"\",\n        \"mdnsTtl\": \"\",\n        \"mdnsLoopback\": true,\n        \"mdnsReuseAddr\": true,\n        \"allowMessagePassthrough\": false\n    }\n]\n\nNote, you can import the workflow in Node-RED by copying the above flow, selecting Import from the Node-RED menu on the top right.\nYou would then create an application for each action you want to perform and change the last part of the URL in the AppleScript and create a new http in node connected to a different homekit-bridged device.\n", "Q: How to select multiple cells on Mac when using Microsoft Remote Desktop?

The log in screen for the OS is similar to the Pre-boot screen on first glance, but they work very differently under the hood.\nWhen you set up your Mac, the user icons and settings that the OS has set, get saved outside the “encrypted” portion of the disk so that when the machine starts up from a powered down state, the OS is not decrypted yet and you see the pre-boot screen.\nOnce you authenticate, the disk is unlocked and the OS starts, only then would you see the fully functioning Lock Screen or log in screen. They behave differently since one has the full macOS running and the other does not.\n\nA: When FileVault (System Preferences/ Security & Privacy/ FileVault) is open to activate the mac you need to enter an administrator password or the recovery key (or Apple ID for reset).

I have an old Digital Sony Handycam and all of the required adapters to connect it to my MacBook USB-C ports.  I tried importing a tape into iMovie 10 and while it did actually import the portion of the tape I played, the import screen on iMovie 10 had message \"No Data Device Detected\" the entire time and the audio could have been better. After doing some research it appears that maybe iMovie 10 is not 100% compatible with these old cameras but that iMovie '09 should still be.\nSo, I would like to download iMovie '09 onto my MacBook in addition to iMovie '10 that I already have.

I am more familiar with Windows and Linux where when I close the application window, the application is closed.\nOn Mac Big Sur, commonly, when I close an application, a small dot exists under the icon in the dock, indicating the program is still running. Why is this?\nFor example, while on Linux or Windows, when I close my sole Visual Studio Code window, the application completely closes. The process is completely gone. When I close vscode on mac, a small dot still exists in the doc, and when I open activity monitor, I can see the 'Code' process is still running.\n\nA: On Windows or Linux an app's window usually is the app. However, macOS is different, as traditionally the app windows can be closed with the app still running (with few exceptions). The menu bar at the top of the screen shows you which app is currently active (there can be only one active app), and even if you close all windows of an app it will still be running and you will be able to control it with the menu bar.\nThe red circle closes the window and not the app, same is true for the ⌘ cmd+W shortcut (or ⌘ cmd+⌥ opt+W for closing all the windows of the active app).\nTo quit the app you can do one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*pressing ⌘ cmd+Q to quit the active app\n\n*clicking on the app name in the top left corner of your screen (on your menu bar) and selecting Quit in the menu to quit the active app\n\n*right clicking (or ^ ctrl+click) on the app bar in the dock and selecting Quit\n\n*selecting the app in the Activity Monitor (Applications>Utilities>Activity Monitor) and using the Force quit button in its top left corner (useful for unresponsive apps)\n\n*pressing ⌘ cmd+⌥ opt+esc to open the Force Quit Applications window (useful for unresponsive apps)\n\nYou can read more about Mac window management here and about quitting apps here.\n\nA: It is the mechanism differences between the operating systems. The red dot you press to \"close\" app doesn't actually terminates the program rather closes the window which the app is running. Closing window shortcut for MacOS is CMD+W which does the same thing as clicking the red dot.\nIn order to terminate a program, you need to use the shortcut of CMD+Q, otherwise the program will be idle in the background.\nShortly: ALT+F4 is equal to CMD+Q in MacOS\nPS: Some applications does not support CMD+W shortcut and red dot acts as CMD+Q. Native Instruments Traktor and Microsoft Teams are the ones I have seen not supporting this.\n", "Q: iTerm2 highlighting pasted text I recently switched to a new machine, and I'm noticing a behavior in iTerm2 I haven't seen before.

What does an application have to do that satisfies the dock system so it stops bouncing the app's icon?\nI am writing an X11 app that runs via XQuartz. I can create an app bundle with an icon for the Desktop such that my app runs fine when I double-click it, but the icon in the dock bounces forever.\nI am aware of the dock feature that allows turning off bouncing for all apps, that's not what I need.\nThanks for any info.\n\nA: An application's icon will bounce in the macOS Dock until the application enters its main event loop and begins responding to user input.\nSee How do I make the dock icon stop bouncing after my app wrapper script starts?\n\nA: The answer: the dock icon will bounce until the parent app process exits.\nTherefore the solution is to fork a new process for your real app and have the parent exit. That's all there is to it.\n", "Q: Do any versions of macOS perform \"SSD data block swapping\" to avoid SSD fatigue? I heard that SSD drives can become fatigued and have data errors, if the same data block is used for reading and writing to many times.  So, there are mechanisms to swap the often used blocks with the less often used blocks.\nOne reference about SSD endurance and wear leveling is on this page.\nFor example, if a Mac had only 10 GB left on the SSD, then this 10 GB could be repeatedly used to download and move files to NAS, or as swap space for virtual memory.\nDoes the current macOS perform the SSD swapping to avoid the fatigue? If so, then with which version of macOS did this first occur? Or, does the Mac's internal SSD use low-level firmware to avoid the fatigue in way transparent to macOS?\n\nA: Wear Leveling\nThis functionality is actually contained within the Solid State Drive (SSD) itself and known as wear levelling. It has been standard on all Macs that have had SSDs - i.e. for many, many years.\nI remember back in approx. 2008 when replacing the internal hard drive of the MacBook Air with a third-party SSD, you had to look out not to buy an older model SSD without wear levelling - but since then it has been a feature that is just always there on an SSD.\nOperating System Agnostic\nThe functionality does not depend on operating system support, so any version of macOS will do. If your system otherwise supports it, running under Windows or Linux is also just fine.\nFree Space\nAlso the functionality does not depend on having \"free space\" on your drive. It doesn't matter if you have 10 GB of free space or 1000 GB of free space. It works just the same.\n", "Q: How can developers properly fix \"App is damaged and can't be opened\" errors? There are already several questions here on this site dealing with the error message \"$App is damaged and can't be opened\". The workaround given (which has worked for me) is to use xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine on the affected app package.\nThe developers of LaTeXDraw, a small open source tool, state that hints about solving this would be welcome. LaTeXDraw shows the problem when installed through their DMG image, as well as through Homebrew. It seems this is a rather old piece of academic software primarily used and developed on Linux, which they just build along for macOS as well, so I would like to help them out.\nI thought the \"proper\" solution to this is just to become a registered developer -- is that correct and sufficient? What is the technical cause of this (very confusingly worded) message, i.e. what would need to be changed in the app package?\n\nA: The developer needs to make sure their application is notarized.\nThe official documentation on how to do that is available here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution\nIn order to get the application notarized, it must first be signed.\nThe developer can choose to use their existing binary and get it notarized \"after the fact\" (instead of during build using Xcode). You would then take the final binary and upload it to Apple using notarytool (comes with Xcode). When the developer gets the ticket back, it can be attached to the binary using the stapler tool.\nThe process is documented here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow#3087734\n", "Q: Preview assigned on all desktop on BigSur After updating from Big Sur from Catalina I have encountered some problems with the Preview app.\nI use multiple Desktops (on the same screen) and after a pdf is opened, then when I switch to the another Desktop, Preview remains opened in the previous one.\nI think it's a bug only for Preview because other apps stay in the Desktop in which they have been opened.\nThe only way to bypass this is to open pdfs with Safari or Acrobat.\nAny help?\n\nA: Right click Preview in the Dock > Options.\nCheck it is not set to All Desktops.

I did the stupid thing of formating by accident the main SSD in my Macbook. I was using Windows through an external drive and hit the \"Erase\" button thinking it was another drive.\nSo I lost EVERYTHING in my computer and it won't boot as MacOS. I can use windows through the external ssd, and the formatted drive is \"Not Allocated\" right now. I only erased, I didn't mounted as a new format.\nIs there any way to recover the partition/files?\n\nA: If you have a standard formatting (I assume it is hard to believe) then the chances are that you can restore it.\nThere are several forms of erasing a data carrier, including deleting the table of contents of a data carrier and erasing individual sectors of a volume.\nSince mostly only the table of contents is deleted with a quick format, the data is still on the SSD, only the SSD or the operating system can no longer find any files.\nIt is therefore possible to restore the files, if you have restored the files, it is advisable to reinstall the macOS operating system, as sensitive files may have been damaged and the system does not work properly.\nI use the Disk Drill program to create data. Please correct me if it's not good software\n\nA: Yes, with an if. There are tools that recover partitions, eg. UFS Explorer. The 'if' is that this depends on the data not being overwritten with something else already, and some partition erasure utilities do give you the option to do that.\nThere are some cases where a partition may be directly restored, otherwise the utility may only give access to the files on the deleted partition, requiring you to copy them to an external drive. The latter is definitely the safer option, regardless.\nI'd recommend taking the demo version of your utility of choice for a test and try to restore a few files to an external drive to make sure that it suits your needs before going any further.\nIf the data on your lost partition is crucial you'll have to decide if you feel it's worth taking to a data recovery expert instead of handling this on your own.\n", "Q: Principle of resolution scaling via External monitor (GPU performance) I will demonstrate my idea on a 4K monitor, there are 4 options:\n\n*\n\n*Native 4K\n\n*1692p\n\n*1440p\n\n*1080p\n\nFrom What I undersrand, the 4K and 1080p should be on par when it comes to the GPU demands as the 1080p is derived (directly scaled, i.e., zoomed) from 2160p. However, 1440p and 1692p, respectively, are more demanding as macOS has to scale down from 2 times higher resolutions, i.e., 2880p and 3384p.\nIf it works that way, then by the same logic, if I list the GPU demands with the 2K and 5K monitors, then the scale would be as follows (starting from the least GPU heavy case):\n\n*\n\n*(2K) 1440p native, (2K) 720p\n\n*(4K) native, (4K) 1080p, (2K) 1080p\n\n*(2K) 1152p\n\n*(4K) 1440p, (5K) native, (5K) 1440p\n\n*(4K) 1692p\n\n*...\n\n*...\n\nDoes it work that way or am I getting it all wrong?\nI have been wondering about this for a long time as Windows uses a different mechanism, which is clear to understand.\n\nA: It is not clear to me how your ranking is supposed to function.\nYou need to make a distinction between whether or not you're using HiDPI-mode (\"Retina-mode\"). This is very important.\nYou can run a 4k monitor at 4k resolution (as seen by the monitor) in two modes - either HiDPI Retina or native 4k. The HiDPI mode is the default chosen by macOS. In this case it will be labelled as \"Looks as 1080p\".\nWhen running in \"native 4k\" everything is rendered 1:1. This means that user interface elements would typically look very small on a normal sized monitor.\nWhen running in \"HiDPI\" mode, you'll see that it will be labelled \"Looks like 1080p\". I.e. text and user interface elements are the same physical size on the monitor as had you chosen a native 1080p resolution. However, text, video, pictures, etc. are actually rendered at 4k (3840x2160) resolution, giving you crisper text and full resolution video.\nWhether or not \"native 4k\" mode or \"HiDPI mode\" is more taxing on the GPU depends on what applications you're running. If you're looking at a blank desktop, the \"native 4k\" mode should use the fewest resources on the system as a whole.\nIf you choose a different resolution, like for example 1440p in HiDPI mode, the system will actually render at double the size - i.e. 5120x2880 - and then scale it down to the 4k output for the monitor. In this case the system has to perform more work than it did for the \"Looks as 1080p\" HiDPI mode.\nHowever, if you run 1440p in native mode, i.e. the output signal for the monitor is 1440p - then that is usually less taxing for the system than 4k native.\n", "Q: How to save picture viewed in iOS Safari to Files (iCloud) Open safari, browse to a page with images, press and hold on the image, select \"Share...\"\nThere does not appear to be a way to 'share' the image to the Files app.\nYet there is an option for \"save to dropbox\".\nHow can I easily achieve this?\n\nA: There are two ways to do this.\n\n*\n\n*Save the image to your photos, then open the photos app and view the image.

So you swipe again, and suddenly the selection ring jumps two icons over rather than the intended one icon.\nOddly, using the remote while plugged into a USB charger seems to restore some speed, at least for a while. But of course using a corded remote is annoying. And a weak battery charge is not the issue, as the slowness occurs whether the battery level is at 46, 60, or 100% charge.\nWe routinely restart the AppleTV as a desperate attempt to avoid this problem. Each user does a restart before and after usage, and often does it while using the AppleTV. This seems to help for a short while.\nThe AppleTV has the latest version of tvOS, with regular updates occurring.\nWhen originally purchased, the remote control was instantaneous.\nDuring this Covid season, we have been wiping the remote control routinely with 70% isopropyl alcohol as recommended by Apple. This definitely makes the remote control go crazy with wrong inputs, but a restart of the AppleTV always straightens it out.\n➥ Is there anything to be done about the AppleTV remote getting slower to react to touch?\n\nA: ➥ Re-pair the remote with the Apple TV device.\nI did this inadvertently. After getting even worse behavior, the remote became unusable, even after restarting the Apple TV. So I purchased another Siri Remote.\nI paired the new Siri Remote by simply pressing a button, and holding the remote physically close to the Apple TV device. New remote worked well. So out of curiosity, I re-paired the old remote simply by pushing any button and then holding close to Apple TV. Two things happened:\n\n*\n\n*The old Siri Remote works well again! After being re-paired with the Apple TV device, the old remote works just like new. The pairing process seems to have fixed the problem.\n\n*The new remote was no longer paired. Pushing any button starts the pairing process. So you cannot have more than one Siri Remote connected at a time. Bummer.\n\nIf anyone else is having this problem with their Siri Remote getting cranky and slow, try re-pairing. I do not know how to un-pair an existing remote unfortunately, except by buying the new remote. Rather than buy, perhaps borrow a friend's Siri Remote to pair and then re-pair the old one.\n", "Q: How can I show hidden files on 'choose a file' dialog in 3rd-party apps? I want to choose a file under hidden directories on any application but Finder, but it seems to be not shown. For example, if I put a file called my.terminal under ~/Dropbox/.hidden/, and try to choose the file on Terminal (Preferences -> Profiles -> Import), I could not reach the file because it is, I think, put under a hidden directory. The file is not searchable on the search box.\nIn this case, I first have to copy the file to other directories that are non-visible, and then choose the file again. This is quite painstaking and I want to avoid it, but is this possible on macOS (Big Sur)?\nI already set the Finder such that it shows hidden files, but this has no effect on other applications.\n\nA: As noted, you have found how to show invisibles, in Finder and in file-picker dialogs…\nYou are going to be hampered, however, by the fact that Spotlight will not index hidden or System locations, so they will not show up in search.\nA potential partial workaround would be to open your destination folder in Finder before you need it in an app. Then, when you are presented with any file-picker dialog, you can drag that folder into the dialog & the file-picker will go to that location.\n", "Q: Garbage when printing pdf exported from Pages I have an issue when printing pdf documents exported from Pages. The pdf looks fine in Preview but when printing, the printer (Xerox 3260 with latest drivers) just spits out almost empty pages with some garbage characters in the top. Printing directly from Pages works fine as well as printing pdf documents from other sources. Bug?\n\n*\n\n*macOS Big Sur (11.1)\n\n*Pages 10.3.9\n\n*Printing over AirPrint\n\n\nA: Printing out loads of blank pages (along with some random chars) usually means that the printer is taking in the incoming print job as raw data, rather than as a PostScript file to be interpreted.\nCheck the printer's manual for the name of the print queue to which the job should be sent (usually one of AUTO, PS, PCL or RAW -- so choose PS), or make sure it's configured to use PostScript as a higher priority than raw data.\n\nA: Apple’s troubleshooting guide has a helpful tidbit on disabling Print Dialog Extensions (PDEs) and using generic drivers towards the middle of all the steps.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/solve-printing-problems-on-mac-mh14002/mac\n\nOptions & Supplies button, select the Use Generic Printer Features checkbox, then click OK.\n\nIf that fails, does a test page print correctly?\n\n*\n\n*https://support.usa.canon.com/kb/index?page=content&id=ART166363\nIf that fails, you may have to do each step in order from the guide above on solving printing problems from Apple Support.\n\nA: I found a possible workaround. Symptom: Multiple applications such as Pages, Notes, Preview print \"UNIRAST\" followed by garbage and many pages. Updating printer firmware and re-installing drivers did not help.\n\n*\n\n*Reset printer system\n\n*Re-added the printer as AirPrint\n\n*Then added it again, so it gives it the same name followed by \"2\", but this time I set it as Generic PCL Laser Printer.\n\nSo far, prints from Notes, Pages, Preview are going okay, as I've set this PCL version to my default. I found the idea here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250857812 where someone describes this same workaround, and also another useful link that didn't quite solve it was here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252484142 - there's a theory the drivers from HP aren't 64-bit, thus causing the problem, but I am not sure about that.\n", "Q: Does the iOS App Store share information with developers that can identify specific users of their apps? Can the developer access information from the iOS App Store that uniquely identifies single users - or do they just get aggregate information?\n\nA: No, developers on the iOS App Store do not receive information from the App Store that uniquely identifies users of apps. That includes both free and paid apps. The developer also do not receive a list of device names of devices where their app was installed or purchased.\nThe developer can access only aggregate information, such as the number of purchases made by customers in a specific country.\nNote that the developer might have other means of getting information about their users. For example by including a login system in their app, letting the user link in Facebook accounts, and similar. However that would be something that is separate from Apple's App Store.\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to transfer photos from Google Photos to iCloud Photos? I have more than 5 000 photos stored on Google Photos and I'd like to know what's the easiest way to move them on iCloud photos. Since the free storage ends on June I want to move everything on iCloud.\nHere's what I've tried :\n\n*\n\n*Selecting all of them on the Google Photos app and downloading them, but it randomly skips some pictures, and it stops after some hours of download. Since it downloads them in a random order I have to delete them all and start over.\n\n*Downloading them from Google Takeout and uploading them from icloud.com on a PC, but it only accepts JPEG files, so most of the pictures are not uploaded (the file format is .HEIC) and videos are skipped.\n\nI have no other idea on how to do this, I hope anyone can help!\n\nA: Your second idea seems like it's very close to working. But I think the issue is that icloud.com is just not a 'first class' interface to icloud photos. Instead try:\n\n*\n\n*Download the photos to your mac from Google using Takeout\n\n\n*Enable iCloud Photos on Apple Photos on your Mac\n\n\n\n*Add the photos to Apple Photos on your Mac, and wait for them to be uploaded to iCloud.\n\nA: You can download the photos from Google to your PC and then upload them to icloud.com\n\nA: I have been attempting to do the very same thing for at least two weeks now.\nI used Google Takeout and successfully imported all the files using the Photos application (which I sync to iCloud). I'd recommend this route.\nMy sticking point is that Apple's facial recognition is absolute trash. After two weeks of using both my 2017 i7 MBP and my iPhone 11 Pro Max, it still hasn't identified the majority of faces even after being tagged.\n\nA: Download all the photos from Google Takeout and import all the photos (should be in a folder) and upload them to iCloud Photos on the web, or using a Mac, into the Apple Photos app.\n", "Q: How to use sshfs on Apple Silicon (M1) I'm trying to get sshfs working on Apple Silicon (M1) and Big Sur.\nI have hit a brick wall. I installed some version of macFUSE already. I also tried building what I think is the latest for January 2021 but the instructions on https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/751 it sounds like it should already be possible, but I'm unable to get it working.\nAnyone have a step-by-step out there to build, patch or install sshfs on Big Sur for M1?\n\nA: As of MacFuse 4.0.5, you need to\n\n*\n\n*reboot info recovery mode and go to the terminal\n\n*disable SIP with csrutil\n\n*reboot\n\n*install macfuse\n\n*link the extension\n\n*reboot into recovery mode and re-enable SIP\n\nrelated details here\n", "Q: Disable mouse interference in input source overlay when switching? The problem described in Disable mouse interference in Cmd-Tab overlay? is annoying, but I can live with it. What I cannot live with is the very same problem, but happening when switching input sources, aka keyboard layouts. I use multiple keyword layouts and I need to switch them 500 times per day, reliably. I'm using this key to do that:\n\nThe issue is that in like half of the times I want to switch input sources, which is typically when I'm typing, the \"mouse\" cursor is parked in a position on the screen which interferes with the input source switching overlay, causing the wrong layout to be chosen and driving me completely mad. What can I do to ban the cursor from ruining my life? Thanks!\n\n\nA: As I've never seen a keyboard with that 'globe' on the Fn key to switch layouts, I'm curious as to what your Control panel for it looks like.\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources.\nIf that's anything like mine, just switch it to another key command. I use Ctrl/Spacebar & like you I only have 2 languages, so it's a simple flip between the two.\n\nThis produces no screen overlay, but if you have the language menu bar item, you see the flags switch.\n\nA: There's also an option to use Caps lock without overlay in Keyboard/Input Sources settings.  But only when switching between Latin and non-Latin layouts.\n\nMacOS Big sur\n", "Q: update_dyld_sim_shared_cache is taking up a lot of memory I just noticed that update_dyld_sim_shared_cache is taking up 5.5GB of memory. It is significantly slowing down my MacBook. Would it be safe to force quit this?\nI am using macOS Big Sur Version 11.1\n\n\nA: This specific program is used to update a separate dynamic linking cache for the Simulator app that comes with Xcode. It runs to update the cache at times such as for example after updating Xcode and after installing new iPhone/iPad/iOS/iPadOS models/versions in the simulator.\nNormally it should run to completion within a reasonable time, and then go away until the next update.\nIf it keeps running for hours and hours, it is safe to stop the process. The cache will be updated automatically later as necessary.\n", "Q: terminal.app eats SHIFT key when used with UP and DOWN arrows (but not left or right) Using cat in Terminal.app in order to view the raw codes, I get the following:\n$ cat\n^[[D    # LEFT\n^[[1;2D # S-LEFT\n^[[C    # RIGHT \n^[[1;2C # S-RIGHT\n^[[A    # UP\n^[[A    # S-UP\n^[[B    # DOWN\n^[[B    # S-DOWN\n\nwhere:\n\n*\n\n*S is for the shift key\n\n*LEFT is for left arrow\n\n*RIGHT is for right arrow\n\n*UP is for up arrow\n\n*DOWN is for down arrow\n\nThus, the shift key is ignored in conjunction with the up and down arrows, but not with the left and right arrows.\nI don't see anything under Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > keyboard that would explain this behaviour (following this answer, that is how I solved a similar problem).\nI could probably use DefaultKeybinding.dict (see this other answer for example) but that doesn't explain the behaviour.\n\nA: I'm not sure what there is to \"explain\".
