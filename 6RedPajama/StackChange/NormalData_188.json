["Q: OpenJDK patched with font fixes mess up google chrome fonts I've installed the patched OpenJDK in order to get proper font rendering in WebStorm 8. It works fine but i realized chrome has some font rendering problems since then. I only see this in chrome so far, Firefox has no problems, either any other applications on the system.\nI followed this gist: gist.github.com/leemour/5620265.\nA screenshots about the problem: ( look at the fontawesome font rendering, and the devtools window )\n\nEDIT: the problem solved, there is a gist that summarizes the steps: https://gist.github.com/TheSpiritMolecule/6580548808a2828b0cb1\n\nA: Try to remove infinality. It is not strictly needed:\n$ sudo apt-get purge fontconfig-infinality\n\nBTW the weird rendering you see in your second screenshot (fonts pixelated and \"bolded\") are related to WebStorm not getting the Java parameters:\n-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd\n-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true\n-Dswing.aatext=true \n\nThis will happen to other Java programs unless you add those parameters to each Java launcher. An easier way to do that is just creating a file (/etc/profile.d/java_opts.sh) with the following content:\nexport _JAVA_OPTS=\"-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd -Dsun.java2d.xrender=true -Dswing.aatext=true\"\n\nand make it executable:\n$ sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/java_opts.sh\n\nNote that those settings will only be loaded after you logout/login.\nAlso you can check if an app is using those settings starting it from a terminal. You should see a line starting with Picked up _JAVA_OPTS\n", "Q: getting error while trying to install ubuntu-tv in ubuntu 14.04 LTS Im trying to install Ubuntu-TV and I ran apt-get install unity-lens-video and it returned This error:\nSelecting previously unselected package unity-scope-video-remote.\nPreparing to unpack .../unity-scope-video-remote_0.3.15+13.10.20130920-0ubuntu1_i386.deb ...\nUnpacking unity-scope-video-remote (0.3.15+13.10.20130920-0ubuntu1) ...\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nAny Idea to solve this problem ?\n\nA: According to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuTV/Contributing Ubuntu-TV is only available to be installed in 12.04 (and is suggested to install in a virtual machine if you are running a newer version). I have not tried it, but you could use something like http://www.howtogeek.com/117635/how-to-install-kvm-and-create-virtual-machines-on-ubuntu/ and install Ubuntu 12.04 from the ISO and try Ubuntu-tv there.\n", "Q: How do I use Nvidia GTX 860M with 14.04? When I installed ubuntu 14.04 there were no drivers in the additional drivers dialogue for my graphics card. I installed x-org edgers PPA and used a driver but it causes ubuntu to freeze when using the touchpad. How can I remedy these problems? Also all the research I have done the answers are far too complicated, looking for an easy to understand instructions!\n\nA: The 860M card is supported by nVidia's proprietary drivers.\nYou can install them pretty quickly and easily. It just looks scary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the appropriate driver from nVidia's webpage. It saves a .run file.\n\n*Change to console mode with alt+ctrl+F2, log in and then navigate to your Downloads folder with cd ~/Downloads  \n\n*Type chmod +x NVIDAFILENAMEHERE.run and then press enter\n\n*Type sudo service lightdm stop and then hit enter\n\n*Type ./NVIDAFILENAMEHERE.run and then press enter\n\n*Follow the prompts on screen to install the drivers.\n\n\nA: I had similar problems to yours, using either 14.04 or 14.10.\nI'm currently using Ubuntu 14.10, but I believe the procedure is the same for 14.04:\nAs Sylvain Pineau suggested, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and add the xorg-edgers PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nUpdate the packages list:\nsudo apt-get update\nThen press the Super key (usually the Windows logo on your keyboard), type Additional Drivers and press Enter. You should now have a choice of driver to use:\n\nSelect \"Using NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.76 from nvidia-340 (open source)\", enter your password and press Apply Changes.\nRestart your computer and enjoy! You should have access to a new NVIDIA settings tools called \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\" (press the Super key and type \"nvidia\" to look for it).\nSince I'm using my computer for work, I need better battery life and I don't really need the power of the NVIDIA card so I deactivate it by going in the NVIDIA tool and selecting \"Intel (Power Saving Mode)\" from the \"PRIME Profiles\" section.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: There are two options - \nOne is to use NVIDIA's drivers with NVIDIA Prime Switch. \nThis way you can switch between GPU's \"per session\". i.e. you have to logout and login to change GPUs. And all apps use the particular GPU selected for that session. \n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bumblebee* primus nvidia*\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346-updates\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings nvidia-prime\n\nOr you can use Bumblebee's optirun to run per-program via NVIDIA.\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-prime\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346-updates\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia bbswitch-dkms primus\n\nIt's recommended to use the nvidia-346-updates or nvidia-352-updates drivers from the edgers repo ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa instead of the ones available from Ubuntu's default repos.\nI have written an elaborate blog post detailing both methods \nhttp://blog.championswimmer.in/2015/11/using-nvidia-optimus-switchable-graphics-with-gtx-860m-on-ubuntu-15-04\n", "Q: Testing sound with different results I have mount surround sound in Ubuntu 14.04. When I am testing it with command:\nspeaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6 -l1 -twav\n\neveyting sounds fine but when I am using System Settings > Sound > Test Sound,  the results differ. I got poor performance on right channels(right channels pause about every 0,5 sec). While listening to music I get this poor performance from the second test and I do not get why.\n\nA: If I'm not wrong, speaker-test calls on ALSA directly for the test whereas Ubuntu uses PulseAudio to interface with ALSA. That's why you're hearing a difference.\n", "Q: Retrieve data from a FreeSpace volume [previously ext4 volume] Morning, Afternoon, Evening, any thing you wish.\nI'm using an HP-ProBook 4540S\n\n\n*\n\n*750 Gb HDD\n\n*4 Gb of memory\n\n*Intel Core i3-3110M CPU 2.40GHz x 4\n\n\nI'm a software developper,so I use to install 2 Ubuntu system, one for my work an other as placeholder (prevent from loosing access to data on third volume used as).

I was wondering how do I boot from a USB with Ubunutu on it. This is with the intention of re-loading ubuntu onto my computer.\nAt the moment I have only Ubuntu on my computer. When I was running windows on an old computer you would press f12 or something to access the BIOS, however on this computer, running windows 8, there is no pause to press f12 and I had to go into settings and choose to re-boot and access the BIOS as described here: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-access-the-bios-on-a-windows-8-computer/\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: I assume you want to boot an OS (Ubuntu) from USB. In this scenario all the data is loaded into your system memory and whenever you restart the computer all your local data will be lost! But there is a workaround, if you create a Persistent Live USB. The persistence allows you to keep your preferences and data even after reboot so you can install applications and save your data on the live system, it will be saved on the USB.\nA Persistent Live USB should be 4GB or bigger, the OS will take up 1-2GB of space and the rest will be used as persistent storage on your USB.\nThere is a very nice and easy GUI application for windows that i suggest you to use in order to create a Live Persistent USB.

This caused SysRq+K to be completely disabled.\nTo understand this, you have to know a little about bits, bit masks and hexadecimal numbers:\n\n\n*\n\n*176 is $B0 in hex, or 1011 0000 in binary.\n\n\nTo make Alt+PrtSc+K work, the second bit must be set:\n\n\n*\n\n*1011 0000  OR  0000 0100 = 1011 0100\nThis will be $B4 in hex or 180 in decimal.\nSo here we go:\n$ sudo sh -c \"echo 180 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\"\n\nThe SysRq combination should work perfectly now, and without requiring reboot nor logout.\n", "Q: can't download new packages and updates dpkg: error processing package sessioninstaller (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n libxapian22\n zeitgeist-core\n zeitgeist-datahub\n zeitgeist\n activity-log-manager\n activity-log-manager-control-center\n python-xapian\n apt-xapian-index\n rhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist\n unity-lens-applications\n sessioninstaller\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: Open a terminal and type:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nI think it will do the job...  :)\n", "Q: Which video cutting software runs under Linux/Wine I know this actually might not belong here.

Can someone help me with that, and what to do next?\n\nA: This is python code extending with C. No need to use make. Python itself will take care of the cpp code compilation with proper flags. \nFirst you need to have header files and a static library.

However Samsung produces a stupid proprietary RAW format instead of the standard RAW format (do other vendors do this?). And instead of RAW files I get .SRW files. Ubuntu recognizes them as TIFF but nautilus does not show thumbnails and image viewer does not show them. I can open them using Rawtherapee or Darktable and that is more than fine.\nHowever, I was wandering if there is a quick and dirty way to mass convert all SRW files to TIFF files (or any other lossless standard). \n\nA: As far as I know, each manufacturer has its own RAW format. You can change the format easily with the software ufraw-batch.\nYou need the latest version of ufraw to process .srw files, to add it to your repositories do the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:crass/ufraw\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ufraw-batch\n\nNow you need to make a script to convert the files. Example: Save the following as scriptname.sh For simplicity, save it in the same directory as your images.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in \"*.srw\";\ndo\n        echo \"Processing $f\"\n        ufraw-batch \\\n                --wb=camera \\\n                --exposure=auto \\\n                --out-type=tiff \\\n                --out-path=. \\\n            $f\ndone\n\nThen open the terminal and navigate to the directory where your files are located(ex: cd /home/user/pictures/) \nand execute the script as follows: \nsh scriptname.sh\n\nThe script should convert every SRW image to tiff and keep it in the same directory. To stop the script(as it takes a long time to process many images) press ctrl+c while on the terminal.\nIf you want to move all the .tif images to a new folder to tidy up the images, you can do:\nmv *.tif folder_to_save_all_the_tiffs/\n\n", "Q: '/usr/' versus '/usr/local/' for source installation Are there any differences when you compile software and move it to either '/usr/local' or to the '/usr/' directories? Personally, I try to move everything to '/usr/local/' so I don't need to search for all of the prerequisites, but I notice that each source has different defaults. Any thoughts?\nThanks!\n\nA: Usually /usr/local/bin appears first in your PATH, so if you have a command called qwerty in both those locations and run qwerty in a terminal, you will be executing the one in /usr/local/bin.\nPersonally I put all manually installed software in /usr/local so it does not clash with anything managed by apt/dpkg.\n", "Q: Which ubuntu to choose I am switching from windows 8.1 to ubuntu which ubunutu you prefer me to choose?

I would like to setup RAID 1 without losing the data on my currently installed drive. \nIf I use the mdadm process outlined in this tutorial: http://www.mysolutions.it/tutorial-mdadm-software-raid-ubuntu-debian-systems/, will my data be preserved? \n\nA: It is possible, but know that it will take a bit of time for the mirror to finish since we are talking about 3 TB. What I would do is:\n\n*\n\n*First prepare the disk with gdisk since fdisk can not do a partition larger than 2TB. Let us assume that the partition created was sdb1\n\n\n*Run sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --force --level=1 --raid-devices=1 /dev/sdb1. The important part here is to tell mdadm that you are using --raid-devices=1 one disk right now for the RAID Level 1.\n\n\n*Format the newly created RAID partition and copy everything from the original disk to this partition.\n\n\n*Now prepare the other drive to be included to the RAID by issuing the following command (Assuming the original drive is sda1:\n sudo mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2 --add /dev/sda1\n\nThis will grow the RAID Array (md0), set the amount of devices on it to 2 (sdb1, sda1) and add the original sda1 to it.\nYou can check the process of it with sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0 it should show something like this at the end:\nNumber   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n   0       8       49        0      active sync   /dev/sdb1\n   1       8       65        1      spare rebuilding   /dev/sda1\n\nAnd after it is finished:\nNumber   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n   0       8       49        0      active sync   /dev/sdb1\n   1       8       65        1      active sync   /dev/sda1\n\nI recommend a reboot after this to make Nautilus see the RAID correctly. You can verify this is working but literally removing one of the drives while having the unit mounted and still being able to execute or view a video in it. Of course the output of --detail above would be something like:\nNumber   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n   0       0        0        0      removed\n   1       8       65        1      active sync   /dev/sda1\n\nIn this case I disconnected the drive sdb and still could work on the information.\nUPDATE: Since util-linux 2.24, fdisk now has support for partitions larger than 2 TB and has support for GPT schemes. This support has landed in Ubuntu 14.10. Apart from this, the interface has gotten much friendlier and it supports better human readable sizes.

Also if you can do the install with a mouse then go back to a regular boot, run a dpkg-repack (I'll give you a link in a bit) and save that to a USB then you can reinstall all the drivers later...

I also checked for the file ~/.config/variety/scripts/set_wallpaper, but I do not even have the ~.config/variety folder. Any ideas? If you need more info let me know what you need.\n\nA: IMHO you have either a corrupt installation due to a corrupted ISO download or your drive is failing. If the checksums match, it's the latter and you need to replace the drive. If the former you should download the installation media again, verify the checksum and if it matches, reinstall.\n", "Q: Using cpulimit on a command rather than a PID I am trying to use cpulimit on a command, like:\ncpulimit -e 'tar -chzf [...]' -l 50 \n\nbut cpulimit seems not to be able to start the process:\nWarning: no target process found.

This works either by me clicking the top right unity bar icon, or by issuing an rfkill block wifi followed by an rfkill unblock wifi command\nI haven't found a solution to the read problem yet, but I got this idea that if i could programatically handle this situation with a script that triggers when the disconnect occurs, i'll be just fine.\nI also don't want to create a script that constantl polls for the wifi status, I'd want to listen for this specific event, and act uopn being notified.\nIs this somehow possible?\n\nA: First of all:\nWhat you describe as your desired answer is what you actually call: I also don't want to create a script that constantl polls. Inotify also is used in a constant loop to \"listen\" to changes in the current state. In other words: the other option you assume to exist does not exist without some kind of a loop.\nI also think your image of a loop is too heavy. On every system, in every application  there are numerous loops active to wait for triggers.

I installed Ubuntu using the method described in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyMqqU2Mqs\nIn short, I installed crouton Ubuntu with the unity interface.\nand when installing Gimp through the terminal, it deleted a the software center and some other files that may have been important. So when shut down Ubuntu and later tried to get back into it, I couldn't. I learned that I could recover my files by booting Ubuntu using a USB, and my question is how I would do that? Thank you for you help. I only have 3 months of Linux experience, so you might have to talk things out for me.\n\nA: \nI learned that I could recover my files by booting Ubuntu using a USB[…]\n\nNo!\nThat's what we get when people are too busy posting videos of the same thing over and over instead of improving the actual documentation and explaining things straight to the point for novice users. But hey, it's way cooler to be an attention whore. (✿◠‿◠)\n(Chromebook + crouton + Ubuntu) ≠ (Laptop + Ubuntu)\nIt's NOT equal, because…\n\ncrouton: Chromium OS Universal Chroot Environment\n\nThe first line in README.md\n…you are using a chroot when using crouton! You are NOT installing Ubuntu as intended using live media or installation media for supported embedded devices.\nAccessing files\nAccessing your files in the chroot – which is simply speaking just an isolated part of the filesystem – should be easy if you know where it resides in the filesystem. It's usually /var/chroot/, but this may not be true for Chrome OS or crouton. On the other hand you would face the same problem when probably successfully booting live media on the Chromebook and eventually accessing the Chrome OS data partitions.\nBacking up files\nIf you have trouble finding the location, but still know how to use crouton to manage your chroots, the following part from the README.md will generate a .tar.gz with all of your data and the chroot OS data, that you could browse with file-roller or any other archive manager.\n\nA backup a day keeps the price-gouging data restoration services away\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*sudo edit-chroot -b chrootname backs up your chroot to a timestamped tarball in the current directory. Chroots are named either\n  via the -n parameter when created or by the release name if -n was not\n  specified.\n  \n*[…]\n  \n\nBy the way, it's not the author or contributors fault. They did a good job by making this tool available. It's everyone else's fault for doing such a poor job explaining what a chroot (on Linux) is and what the result will be when you install Ubuntu on a Chromebook this way. (Something that looks like Ubuntu, but isn't supported by anyone and you as a user shut yourself out of what you thought was your hardware. It's Google's hardware, you're just allowed to use it.)\nAPT logs and history\n\n[…] and when installing Gimp through the terminal, it deleted a the software center and some other files that may have been important.\n\nDefinitely not. Just installing Gimp on a supported installation through terminal or software center is completely safe and shouldn't uninstall critical components or make the system unstable in anyway.\nYou can look at the histroy of installed, uninstalled and updated packages with:\nzless /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nOf course the path is from inside the running OS or chroot (should be /var/chroot/my_chrooted_ubuntu/var/log/apt/history.log). Older logs have the following scheme :  history.log.1.gz. You can leave the zless program by typing q.\n", "Q: How to access MySQL after deleting all MySQL users?

How and where can one edit/remove links to applications in Gnome shell?\nTo clarify: i mean the list that can be accessed through super -> mouse-click on \"All applications\" symbol in Favourites panel; alternatively - in the list displayed when something is put into filter textbox.\nWhat i am interested in particular: how can i remove from there programs installed with wine, that had their wineprefix folder deleted.\nP.S. I do not have unity and its system->applications menu - for sake of clarity.\n\nA: If there is an icon remaining in the GNOME Application Menu, that means that there is a '.desktop' file linking that to the Applications Menu.\nThe location of this file is different depending on where you got it from (apt, wine, pacman, snap, etc) and probably your distro (this is for Ubuntu).\nIf it's from the apt the files will be located in either\n/usr/share/applications\n\nor\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nFor wine applications:\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nor\n~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs\n\nFor snap applications:\n/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications\n\nSometimes the name of the .desktop file will not match the name of the program - watch out for that.\n\nA: If an application is (still) in the application list, it means that there is still a representing .desktop file of the application in either:\n/usr/share/applications\n\nor\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nThe \"orphan\" .desktop file should be removed, to remove the application from the application list (or from Dash if you use Unity)\nI suspect it is the last mentioned, since you mention wine, and wine sometimes installs (a lot of) .desktop files locally. Normally, when you uninstall an application (not wine applications), the corresponding .desktop files in /usr/share/applications is removed automatically.\nFinding the right .desktop file\nIt can sometimes be a bit difficult to identify the right desktop file, since the file's name does not necessarily match the application's name. By making the (local) desktop file executable, it should be easier to identify, since the displayed name is then the same as the application's name, and the file also shows the application's icon once it is made executable.\n\nA: On the path\n/usr/share/applications\n\ntype\nsudo rm <your-file-icon>\n\nWorked on Ubuntu 16.04\n", "Q: Unable to mount a hard drive due to windows 8 hibernation I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop, and I had a problem when I want to mount a hard drive due to windows 8 hibernation.\nThe problem is that when I was partitioning my hard drive I formated the drive which contained Windows 8 without shutting down Windows, I only did a hibernation, so now I can't resume and shutdown Windows fully.\nNow I can only mount my hard drive as read-only.\nHow can I solve this problem ??\n\nA: Boot with windows and in cmd type powercfg -h off to disable hibernation and then try boot with Ubuntu this will fix.\nAlso you can fix that from Ubuntu:\nUse sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdXY where XY is the partition name. ex:sda4. use gparted to find partition name.\n", "Q: Can I run Ubuntu in live mode permanentely?

Once in live mode I try to install ubuntu on another usb-drive but have some difficulties. \nIs there any difference between running live-mode on a thumbdrive and installing ubuntu onto another thumbdrive?\n\nA: The main difference to a pure live session is persistence of your modifications to the system across reboots no matter where you install Ubuntu, i.e. modifications are erased if you turn off the non-persistent live session (or someone pull the thumbdrive out of USB plug and asks politely if he_she might borrow that for a second).

Is it possible to display a notification (via libnotify or something similar) when the current song changes? The app I'm streaming the music from is Google Music on Android, if that helps.\n\nA: Metadata is sent over AVRCP profile, not over A2DP. If your phone does AVRCP 1.0 then it will not send any metadata info. If it does AVRCP 1.3 or above then you should see metadata.

Run xrandr to discover which device you should use.\n\nUpdated answer\nSince you have only one monitor (your TV) try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Discover the output name of your TV. It is probably HDMI1 or VGA1. To do it, run xrandr then search for the word \"connected\". For example, if you see HDM1 connected, then your TV is HDMI1.\n\n*Try doing a xrandr --output HDMI1 --auto. See if the resolution gets okay.\n\n*If not, you'll have to do a xrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1024x768, for example. However, you should replace 1024x768 to a resolution that your TV supports. The output of xrandr will tell you the available ones.\n\nA: What you are looking at is a\"feature called \"overscan\" (or \"zoom\" on some TVs). It's the TV itself cutting off the edges!\nSo, look for a feature called overscan (or zoom) in the setup of the TV, and disable it!\nSome history:\nLong time ago, when cathode ray tubes - CRTs - were used as television displays, and the images were transferred in an analogue way, it had a technical reason, it was useful.\nThe TV stations were used to always have a border with nothing important in it.\nWith pixel matrix displays like LCD, overscan no longer makes sense.\nBut people are used to have it, and think it's better to have the feature than not have it. \nIf you want to sell LCD TVs, you have customers asking for it, and because it costs nothing to provide it, you better list that feature in the description.\nIt will not do any harm, no problem. Except if someone enables it.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Samsung TV connecting to my laptop via HDMI and found the solution by going to the TV Menu > Picture > Screen Adjustment > chose \"screen fit\" that fixed it. There you will find other options too but for me the screen fit did the trick and that over scan issue was fixed. \nAll this time i was thinking it was the display setting on the Ubuntu laptop i needed to fix. Hope This helps other.\n\nA: For LG TV's (webOS 4, Software Version 05.30.10)\nAll Settings > Picture > Aspect Ratio Settings > Just Scan > On\nAlthough you might experience performance issues when running on a 4K resolution screen with the maximized app window, the app runs smoothly if you scale the app window down a little bit.\n\nA: I was having the same problem. The xrandr info in other answers didn't help in my case, but it was good background anyway.  I fixed the problem on my screen by resetting the aspect ratio setting back to 1:1.  It had somehow been changed to \"wide\".  \n\nA: Samsung TV:\nTools -> Image Size (change from 16:9 to adjust screen).\nIf you have another TV or monitor you just search for your model in google/youtube with overscan or zoom image mode\n\nA: Switch Your TV-settings to the 4:3 format. Now You see two black blocks left and right beside the desktop margins. If a third of ubuntu's control panel is cut off now, You can be sure of that the problem is not Your TV.\n\nA: Guys there is simple solution to it using panasonic TV. In the Advanced Settings, turn the overscan off. This fixes the problem\n", "Q: Redirected Output I just used a command ls -l > ~/ls_output in my /usr/bin directory and I'm not sure what happened.  The terminal accepted my command but I don't know what happened to the output or where it went.  I think I may have redirected the output to a new directory called ls_output but I'm not sure and I'm also unclear on how ~ works in Bash.\nAny advice?\n\nA: ~ expands to $HOME, your home directory, such as /home/justin or /home/muru. \nSo ls -l > ~/ls_output will create a file in your home directory, redirecting the output to the file at ~/ls_output (not a directory), creating a new file if necessary and raising an error if it can't.\nDo ls -l ~/ls_output to verify that the file was created.\nDo cat ~/ls_output to see the contents.\n", "Q: CMake can't find X11 I'm trying to compile Minetest 0.4.10 on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS with CMake, but I get this error:\nandrew@rasts-tv:~$ cmake \\Minetest-0.4.10\n-- *** Will build version 0.4.10 ***\n-- IRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR = \n-- IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR = IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND\n-- IRRLICHT_LIBRARY = IRRLICHT_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND\n-- Could NOT find IRRLICHT (missing:  IRRLICHT_LIBRARY IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR) \n-- CURL_INCLUDE_DIR = CURL_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND\n-- CURL_LIBRARY = CURL_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND\n-- CURL_DLL = \n-- GetText disabled\nCMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindX11.cmake:411 (MESSAGE):\n  Could not find X11\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\n  src/CMakeLists.txt:147 (find_package)\n\n\n-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\n\nI installed LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment), but it still shows the same error.

I'm having issues with Apport randomly launching, telling me that there was a crash (usually in background applications), and asking if I want to report it.  When I look at the application, everything is fine, but Apport seems to think it crashed.  Two examples that occurred today are a LibreOffice spreadsheet (which had nothing wrong), and a Chromium download (which finished successfully even though it supposedly \"crashed\").\nMy question:\nI know how to use apport and ubuntu-bug to send a bug report about a different program, but how can I send a bug report specifically about apport?\n\nA: From man apport-bug:\nYou can provide a package name or  program\nname to apport-bug, e. g.:\n\n   apport-bug firefox\n   apport-bug /usr/bin/unzip\n\nSo try:\napport-bug apport\n\nI got this when I tried:\n\n(I didn't submit.)\nSee the guide on reporting bugs.\n\nA: I suspect this is actually not a bug in Apport, and that the crashes it told you about are real. Both LibreOffice and Chromium often use multiple processes. (Especially Chromium, which uses at least one separate process per tab.) One can crash, while others continue running. You can have a minimal-impact crash that doesn't affect your user experience.\nThis is even possible with programs implemented to only ever have a single process running at a time, under limited circumstances, such as if the crash happens as the program is exiting (thus substituting abnormal for normal termination, which may not affect user experience in any obvious way).\nTherefore, I recommend you actually go ahead and report the crashes Apport has told you about, before reporting what you suspect may be a bug in Apport itself. (Or after, if you've already filed the report for Apport.) The information submitted in your bug reports for the LibreOffice and Chromium crashes is very likely to shed light on whether or not said crashes were real, and thus also on whether or not it is a bug for Apport to think they were.\nSpecifically, after reading the bug reporting documentation (you may also wish to take a look at this question), I recommend that you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure Apport to report to Launchpad instead of via Whoopsie. (As described in my answer there, add 'Crash' to the probem_types list in /etc/apport/crashdb.conf.)\n\n*When Apport detects a crash it creates a .crash file in /var/crash. You can run ubuntu-bug with the path to the crash file as an argument.\nFor example, in one of my systems' /var/crash folders, I have grub2-themes-ubuntu-mate.0.crash. If I were to run\nubuntu-bug /var/crash/grub2-themes-ubuntu-mate.0.crash\n\nor cd /var/crash followed by ubuntu-bug grub2-themes-ubuntu-mate.0.crash, Apport would start the bug reporting process for that crash by submitting data it had gathered and stored in that .crash file, then open a web browser window where I could fill out a bug report.\nSo you should do this for your LibreOffice and Chromium crashes (one at a time).\n\n*Sometimes a crash is sufficiently common and recognizable that Apport sends you to the existing bug report for it instead of giving you the opportunity to write your own. If that happens, and you have information to add to the bug report, you can post a comment on it.\nIf you believe you may be suffering from the bug (you can judge this based on the information in the report, but in this situation you very probably are), then you should use the green \"This bug affects...\" link near the top of the bug report to indicate you are also affected. Optionally, you may also wish to subscribe to the bug to receive email about its progress.\n\n*But for bugs that haven't already been reported with sufficient technical detail and then re-reported multiple times, you will be given the opportunity to report a bug yourself.\nIn the web browser, describe fully what was happened leading up to Apport informing you that your applications that seemed to be properly functioning had crashed. Since you suspect there may not have been a real crash and that Apport may be mistaken, you should mention that too (and explain why--i.e., that the applications seemed to be working fine and they continued running). But make sure you provide sufficient factual detail for triagers and developers to allow them to (a) comprehend the report and (b) develop their own hypotheses relying solely or primarily on reported facts. Their initial thoughts may be the same as or different from yours (and may be right or wrong).\nYou should also include links to other relevant bug reports, which in this case will be yours. Assuming you go ahead and report both the Chromium and LibreOffice crashes, you'll have two bug reports. The second report you fill out can include a link to the first bug. Then you can edit the first bug report to include a link to the second.\nIf you've already filed a bug against Apport, you should include a link to it in your LibreOffice and Chromium reports (and explain its significance, of course).\n\n*When you report a crash bug, it will usually be automatically set as private. This is because it's possible for sensitive personal information processed or otherwise accessed by a crashed program to be contained in the core dump that Apport usually includes when you file a crash bug--and to a secondary extent, sensitive information could be contained in registers (their state is usually included) or passed as argument to functions listed in the automatically included stack trace.\nIt's okay for your bug reports to remain private. Likely, provided the core dump can be removed and the report can be inspected by a triager, they'll become publicly accessible. Whether or not that happens, work on them can progress.\nIf you are confident no sensitive information was conveyed, you have the option to mark them public yourself. But you should not feel pressured to do this. It can be helpful under some circumstances but it is by no means necessary, for your bug reports to be effective.\nLinks to a private bug report don't allow someone who doesn't have access to it to gain access. Therefore, you can feel secure in including links to a private bug report in other bug related bug reports (private or not).\n\n*Even a cursory inspection of the Chromium and LibreOffice bug reports may be sufficient for people to determine to high degree of certainty if the crashes they document are real. Or it may take time. Usually, the stack traces included in Apport bug reports are initially less than ideal, due to the absence of some debug symbols packages on your system. A bot on Launchpad runs a retrace, filling in missing debug symbols and often illuminating the conditions and nature of the crash.\n\n*If there are interested individuals who you wish to allow to see your bug even if it's private, you can subscribe them to the bug, on the bug page. Feel free to subscribe me to any bugs you file in connection with the topic of this question. (If you do, I recommend you also post a comment or something, to make sure I know you've done so and that you want me to look at something.) But before you do, take note:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not an expert in fixing bugs. It is possible I will not be able to help. And I cannot commit to providing continued assistance, though I'll probably try to help out. I suspect I'd have further insight into whether or not a crash bug represents a real crash by looking at the files Apport has attached to it, but I cannot promise even that.\n\n*It is not necessary for you to subscribe me or anyone else to a bug report. The necessary groups will already be subscribe and the necessary individuals will see the report.\n\n*You might prefer simply to show me (or whoever) the stack trace or retrace from the bug, to minimize access to potentially sensitive information, if the bug is still private.\n\n*You might feel comfortable looking through a stack trace yourself and satisfying yourself that none of the variables in it contain sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. Then, if you feel comfortable doing so, you could post it publicly on http://paste.ubuntu.com (or elsewhere), opening it up to the whole community's consideration, without having to give everyone access to potentially more sensitive data in the bug report such as the core dump file.\n\n\n*After submitting your bug reports and expressing both the available facts (by description and through the file automatically attached by Apport) and your concerns that the crashes may have been identified and reported erroneously, it is likely sufficient simply to wait.\nYour bug may be automatically (by a bot) or manually (by a triager or developer or, occasionally, a member of the community who is neither) be made a duplicate of an existing bug report, commented on, closed, confirmed, triaged and assigned a severity, or some combination of those things. Any of these actions would likely shed light on the nature of what was reported, including whether or not it was a real crash.\n", "Q: What in the world is wrong with my Ubuntu Touch app? I'm working on an Ubuntu Touch app that works flawlessly with qmlscene. However, when I attempt to run it on an actual device, I get a bunch of dots all over the portion of the screen dedicated to the app (the notification bar along the top is unaffected as well as the launcher when I swipe from the left edge).

When I go to System Details, under graphics, it shows 'VESA: BONAIRE', but I have a AMD Radeon R7 260X. Is this normal? Do I have to install extra drivers? Please let me know.\n\nA: No you do not need extra drivers, these should be fine. Bonaire is a code name for a certain chip. AMD and Nvidia do a whole lot of re-branding of older models on a yearly basis (because OEMs force them to come up with updated model numbers that suggest significantly more performance), so don't be confused when you find this code name in earlier generations.\n\nRadeon R7 260X\nRadeon R7 260X was announced on September 25, 2013.

Because this literally tells echo to output _ first then output $(date) then _ . Spaces separate the variables for echo. \nNow try echo _$(date), note no space between _ and $(date). In this case output will be _Mon Sep 22 03:32:40 MDT 2014 . What does this do? you tell echo to concatenate  underscore with output of $(date). \nTry same thing with _$PWD, which will concatenate your working directory with underscore. Now try echo $PWD_ . The output will be blank. Why? because PWD_ is non-existent environment variable, and as others have mentioned _ is valid character for an environment variable, e.g. $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP . \nSo why _$PWD_ would give _ ? Because you are telling echo to concatenate _ with output of non-existent environment variable. So _ is printed, but $PWD_ output is blank, so you literally see _ concatenated with that blank output. \n\nA: From man bash:\nDEFINITIONS\n       The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.\n       blank  A space or tab.\n       word   A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.\n              Also known as a token.\n       name   A word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, \n              and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.

I have two users on this system userA which is the main user and userB. Currently I have to manually open a terminal using user userA and then run a sequence of some terminal commands which includes running 4 of the 5 shell files I have, then I open another terminal and switch to userB and then run a sequence of some commands and 1 shell file. What I want to do is to have two shell files on the desktop (e.g. userA.sh and userB.sh) and when I double click on the userA.sh it will open a terminal using userA and then run the sequence of commands which includes running four shell files, and when I double click on the userB.sh it will open another terminal and switch to userB and then run a sequence of some commands which includes one shell script.\nEDIT:\nThis is what I did according to Muru suggestion:\nI created a scriptA.sh on the desktop and make it executable then this was it content:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo -u userA bash -c 'PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1; cd /home/userA/scripts'\n\nbut after double clicking it and choosing to run with terminal option, the terminal opens for a second and then closes itself.

Pretty much as the title suggests, my colleague asserts that using a text editor instead of a parser (such as less) locks the file and in the case of logfiles makes it such that the logfile cannot be written to.\nI have never heard of this before and just some initial testing finds this to not be the case. Additionally, I cannot find anything about this on a Google search to suggest where he might have got this idea from.\n\nA: vim doesn't do this, but I'm not sure about the others. However, there's a very simple way to check this:\nOpen up two terminal windows (konsole, gnome-terminal, etc), and run the following commands in the first console:\ntouch ~/test.txt\nvim ~/test.txt\n\nNow, in your second console, type the following:\necho \"This is a test\" >> ~/test.txt\n\nIf the file is locked by vim, your command in the second console will fail, as the file cannot be written to. It won't fail. Repeat with whatever editor you want as step #2 in the first console.\nObviously, if you try and save any changes in your first console, you're wandering into uncharted territory, but as far as appending to log files go, this is safe.\nSome editors, such as vim, gedit and others, create a \"shadow\" file when opening a file to indicate that the file is open in the editor. This is not locking, and does nothing to other applications on your system - it merely serves as a way for the editor to know that the file is open.\n\nA: vim and vi do (an example of the effect). They don't prevent files from being written to, but throw a warning if you use another instance of vi/vim to edit the same file. nano and emacs (v24.3.1) doesn't (at least by default). I'll have to look up other editors. In fact, most decent editors are actually capable of watching for external changes to the file, suggesting strongly that they can't prevent external changes.\nThis maybe true if the application uses some locking function (either using O_EXLOCK on systems which support it, or flock, or something else on Windows).\n\nA: I think I understand your Issue. I was trying to work around same issue myself\nIf you create a document using the command:\nsudo nano nanoCreated.py \n\nThe document is created however the document is locked. It can only be edited by nano editor. This will be an issue when you try to edit it with other editors.\nHowever I don't think other editors such as Vim have the same issue.\nTo work around the issue of locking files:\n\n*\n\n*Create a file using the command: touch nameOfFile.py or with any other extension.\nYou are also welcome to use any other commands such as : cat>nameOfFile.py\n\n\n*You can then access the document using: sudo nano nameOfFile.py\n\n\n*You can then edit the document from there and after you save it, it won't be locked and can be edited used by other text editors\nIf you look at the image I've uploaded. I created files nameOfFile and nanoCreated.py files using sudo nano nameOfFile.py and both files were locked as you can see the lock icon. Those two files can only be edited by Nano. However I created the other files using the steps I provided and none of them were locked\n", "Q: how to get user permissions for nfs share? The situation: I simply want to be able to access a Synology NAS from an Ubuntu Server with a non-root user.\nOn the NAS I have this in the exports-file:\n/Directory <client-ip>/255.255.255.0(rw,async,no_wdelay,no_root_squash,insecure_locks,sec=sys,anonuid=1003,anongid=1004)\n\nOn the Ubuntu-Server in fstab I got this:\n<server-ip>:/Directory  /Mountpoint nfs noauto,user,rw 0 0\n\nNow I want to allow UserA, which is used for some automatic processes to mount the share and write to it.\nmount /Mountpoint\n\nMounting as UserA works fine, but I have no permission to even read what's in the directory. As user root I do.\nListing the mountpoint folder shows these permissions:\ndrwxrwx--- 4 UserA root 4096 Sep 17 13:58 Mountpoint\n\nI tried to set the anon-ids in the exports to the ids of UserA, but that didn't help.\nMaking UserA the owner of the folder didn't help either.\nIs there a simple thing I am missing?\nAlso: This needs to be an nfs share as it will transfer large amounts of data.\nEdit: I would prefer to avoid giving read and write permissions to \"others\" for security reasons.\n\nA: Let usera be the primary group of UserA (groups usera). You can find out the GID using: id -g usera on the client system, say it is 1256. Now add your user to the usera group:\nsudo adduser ayven usera\n\nNow, on the server, do:\nchown :1256 /Directory # Replace 1256 with the correct GID\nchmod g+rwxs /Directory\n\nRemount it on the client:\nsudo umount /Directory\nsudo mount /Directory\n\n(You might have to relogin for your new groups to take effect.)\nNow both you and usera have complete access to the NFS share. I have used the setgid bit, so you may have to enable it, I don't remember it. Add any users you wish to have access to this directory to the usera group.\n", "Q: How to create Truecrypt volume using zuluCrypt?

From man stty: stty - change and print terminal line settings.\nIn tty1 I ran this: sudo stty rows 20. Now my tty screen is limited to 20 rows, which allows for 20 rows on the screen. It works with sudo apt-get install libreoffice -s, and any other command.\nNow, it doesn't seem to work with gnome-terminal or xterm, but right now I'm working on solution. Probably, have to change something in .bashrc file.\nA minimalistic solution to the problem would be to use less or more or pg. For example , \nif i simulate installing libreoffice,\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice -s | less\n\nThat way you have last line replaced with : , and still be able to run the command. The only draw pack is that you have to press enter, to skip to the next page in case of pg or next line in case of less/more.\nAnother solution is this to use head or tail command. This will work well if you don't care about the whole output, but only first and ending part of it. Just as the name suggests, these allow you to see either top(head) of the output or end (tail) of the output.

Any other alternatives that won't involve editing a file on each server?\n\nA: A few ways to identify a server:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH fingerprint - secure but changes whenever you redeploy.\n\n*Shell prompt (PS1) and terminal title - insecure (anybody can duplicate it) but simple and practical.\n\n*ip address - secure with an SSH fingerprint, and more easily readable.\n\n*hostname - insecure but very readable.\n\n\nA: Another option is to use liquidprompt --- works for both bash and zsh, and can be easily configured to have the terminal title set and even to color in different colors the hostname in the prompt: \n\n\nA: This solution is a little hackish, but I think it will do what you're looking for. You will need xdotool and wmctrl installed for this to work.\nFirst you have to edit your ~/.bashrc file because by default the terminal resets its title after every line, rendering command line title sets useless.\nRight after: xterm*|rxvt*)\nReplace: PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\nWith: PS1=\"${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h \\w\\a$ \"\nNext we're going to create a custom ssh script called whatever you want, but for this answer I'll be calling mine tab-ssh.

For exmaple:\ntab-ssh username@0.0.0.0\nwill open a new tab, rename it to 0.0.0.0 (i.e. everything following the \"@\" sign), then execute username@0.0.0.0.\nCreated using the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*AskUbuntu: Setting titles in gnome-terminal\n\n*StackOverflow: Opening a new tab in gnome-terminal\n\n*StackOverflow: Single quotes and variable expansion in bash\n\nA: I usually use the hostname, set via $PS1. However, if you'd take the trouble, you can start using GNU screen and then you could define a function like so:\nfunction ssh-title () {\n    host=\"${@: -1}\"  # You could customize it to make it identify the hostname better\n    IP=$(host \"$host\" | awk '/has address/ { print $4 }')\n    echo -ne '\\033]0;'\"$host\"' - '\"$IP\"'\\007'\n    screen ssh \"$@\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Even if you set a title from your local shell, it may get overwritten by the remote shell settings. screen doesn't directly let the remote shell do this, and you have to customize it to allow it do so, making it easier for you to set a title locally and stick to it.\n\n*Look up IP from hostname, while considering the last parameter as the hostname, and set it as the title. I had to do a bit of trial and error before I got a right echo string. You might have to do it too.\n\n*Finally, use screen to start a session with the ssh command. The session ends when the command exits.\n\n\nYou can customize this in various ways. For example, you may save the hostnames and IPs in a file and read from it (kinda like the ssh_config) (and maybe save other things for the title, like usernames).\nNow use ssh-title some.host to connect. I think this is the only way you can do this without editing anything server side.\n", "Q: How recover encrypted home when lost because user password was changed with root? My Ubuntu-encrypted home directory was lost when I changed my user password.\nThis was because I did it from the command line as root. So my user password is no longer linked to my encrypted user data. How do I reunite them?\n\nA: If you did not change the password because you forgot it, you can change it back, make a backup without encryption, delete everything, change password again and restore everything. That's what I can guess while not knowing how the encryption works. Hopefully it will encrypt on import, if you want to feel safe, backup and just copy it somewhere and try to copy back first.\n\nA: I attempted two solutions to rescue this home data for my user1 (let's call it that).\nThe restult is I have my data but have lost system integrity.\ni.) Changed user1 password back to what it was originally\nii.) Set up another encrypted user account (user2), used Dustin Kirkland's tool to recover the data from user1, copied it into user2 home (relying on the oft-cited linux boast that all you have to do to backup is copy your /home directory).\nThe result was mayhem.\nIt was on the face of it not mayhem. It looked on the face of it like this:\ni) Result: user1 account reopened and data accessible by turning password back\nii) Result: user2 account created, and turned into copy of user1 by copying /home/user1 recovery dir into it after being extracted with Kirkland's tool.\nThe mayhem was that my system has now confused passwords between the two accounts.\ni.i.) user1 login requires old password now reinstated (as expected)\ni.ii.) login as user1 root on command line requires root password (as expected - root password was changed when the other user passwords were changed in the operation that caused this bug)\ni.iii.) user1 GUI authentication (e.g. when mounting disk) asks for user2 password. This is not expected and not desirable. It would normally ask for root password in this situation.\nii.) user2 account opens with expected user2 password, and begins to display last saved state of user1, but crashes instantly. Complete lockup.\nPeter Nerlich's convoluted solution looking quite attractive now.\n(N.B. Concrete advice on ii. seems scarce. While it seemed sensible to reinstate home/user1 into the /home directory of another user with the same name, it seemed inadvisable to create two user accounts with the same name on the same machine. And since Kirkland's tool performed its rescue by extracting /home/user1 into a temp directory, it was counter-intuitive to try and put this back in /home/user1. So this was like a conjunction of catch-22's, with snakes and spaghetti all mixed up together. Horrible. Really horrible).\n", "Q: Tomboy Notes Sync Problem Reformatted computer and when I try to sync my fresh install with my back-up tomboy notes I get a synchronization error. When I click details the panel is empty. I have 100's of notes, some of which are critical so I really need this fixed. \nMy back-up directory structure may be corrupted as a result of several failed syncs.

In each directory there's at least 1 .note file and a manifest.xml file.\nAlso, if this structure is messed-up beyond repair, is there some way to recover the data manually? Or perhaps to port it into some other note-taking program and then port it back?\n\nA: All these folders contain your notes, but one certain note may have different versions. So usually the folder number zero contains the largest number of notes (initial versions), and higher numbered folders contain more recent versions (the bigger folder number corresponds to the more recent version).\nI suppose that for correct automatic restore someone also need a copy of ~/.config/tomboy/ directory, or at least a manifest.xml from that place (also see the directory structure here).\nOn restore, if you decide that you don't need the entire history, but just the most recent versions of every note, you can extract those with the following python code:\nimport os\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom shutil import copy2 as copy\n\ninput_dir = 'your/backup/dir/'\noutput_dir = '~/.local/share/tomboy/'\nnotes = defaultdict(list)\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(input_dir):\n    for f in files:\n        if f.endswith('.note'):\n            notes[f] += [root]\nprint(\"Total number of notes: %d\" % len(notes))\nfor k,v in notes.items():\n    newest_version = os.path.join(sorted(v, reverse=True)[0], k)\n    copy(os.path.join(input_dir, newest_version), output_dir)\n\nHope this will help somebody.\nP.S.

My question is somewhat large, but I couldn't figure out how to break it down without ruining it.\nThere doesn't seem to be a very good (functioning) way of mounting a Nexus 4 in Ubuntu, so I was thinking of writing some kind of adb wrapper, because adb works nicely. So my question is:\nWhat are the layers/system parts between Nautilus/Nemo and a removable storage device and how do they work?\n\n\n*\n\n*How does a GUI file manager like Nautilus fetch folder contents and file details.

It seems to be the main way for accessing media data of Android devices without SD cards via USB.\nModern Ubuntu versions (>= 13.04) should ship MTP support for Nautilus already. For older Ubuntu versions (e.g., 12.04) you might have to install a library upgrade manually or from a PPA.\nYou might also have to turn MTP support on in your Android device under “System settings” → “Storage” → “USB connection (PC)”\nGVFS, FUSE, etc.\n\n[…] I was thinking of writing some kind of adb wrapper, because adb works nicely. So my question is:\nWhat are the layers/system parts between Nautilus/Nemo and a removable storage device and how do they work?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*How does a GUI file manager like Nautilus fetch folder contents and file details. Does it throw commands like ls, cd in the background?\n  \n\nThere are a lot of different layers involved, but definitely Nautilus does not run those shell commands in the background; this would be way too slow.\nThe main layer you should look into for your project is GVFS. According to Wikipedia, “GVFS is the virtual filesystem for the GNOME desktop, which allows users easy access to remote data via SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, SMB, and local data via Udev integration, OBEX, MTP and others.”\nSince GVFS has support for FUSE (which may be another interesting layer for our discussion), you might try something like adbfuse. It wraps ADB in a FUSE driver which can then be used by Nautilus via GVFS.

I am connecting to my office desktop through Citrix receiver and my office's desktop is running on other display configuration and I need to install that display resolution in my ubuntu 14.04 to get it working with my office desktop.\nI have checked from admin login, only one display resolution is getting listed.\nPlease advice how can I install other display resolutions. Also if anyone knows from which site can I install display driver for HP, if needed.\n\nA: The HP Pavilion 15-g009AX (G8D85PA) seems to ship with a built in display/panel with 1366x768 pixels native resolution. It wouldn't make sense to try forcing it into outputting a higher resolution. It would either fail to display anything at all or resize and make the image appear blurry.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you really need a higher resolution to be able to work with your corporate desktop, you should attach an external monitor with a higher native resolution, as already suggested.\n\n*Alternatively – or better said, try this first – you should try to set the display size/resolution for this remote connection as described in the product documentation. As Citrix solutions usually use ICA files – which are just plain text files – you can edit a copy of the ICA file and enter a custom resolution that fits your screen. I don't remember the exact lines, but looking at some forum posts, you should look for something similar to this:\nDesiredHRES=1024\nDesiredVRES=768\n\nThis is usually not a big deal and as far as I can remember you can use any display size and aspect ratio, the same goes for RDP connections.\nIf you use a way of connecting to the remote desktop where you don't/shouldn't have access to the ICA file, you should file a request to whoever is in charge of this system to be provided with an option that works with your screen size or file a request to get a device that works with the current setup.\n(Or replace the panel yourself with another that has a higher native resolution and matches your laptop model, which may also require replacing the internal display cable and probably access to HP support technician tools – that you can find online – to remove firmware warnings about changed hardware.)\n", "Q: How to install ownCloud in Ubuntu Server 12.04 I'm having problem installin ownCloud.\nI'm following the instructions you can find here: http://software.opensuse.org/download/package?project=isv:ownCloud:community&package=owncloud\nBut it says that the \"php5-gd, php-xml-parser, php5-mcrypt and ntp\" is needed for it to work but can't be installed.\nI'm runnin 12.04 Server for anyone that wonders\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You're on Installing Prerequisites For ownCloud according to this article. try updating or enabling your software sources in Software and Updates.

When I get to the login screen, I enter my password, the user name and password display disappears, and it just sits at the splash screen indefinitely.\nI've tried several methods mentioned on the internet, such as renaming the .Xauthority file, but when this happens, I GET the infinite loop error that everyone says that's supposed to fix.  When I log in, it creates a new .Xauthority file for me, but it's 0 kb in size.  Then, when I log in, it just loops back to the log in screen.  If I revert to the old file, I get the original error.\nMy other issue is that I've seen it mentioned to just reinstall the desktop.  The problem I'm running into there is my harddrive is FULL and I have a program that I used apt-get install for.  It didn't finish downloading and has about 350mb left to go.  When ever I try to uninstall anything, or reinstall the desktop, I'm told to run: apt-get -f install to take care of some dependencies.\nIf I do, I'm told I'm out of disk space.\nI've also tried adding another hard disk, but can't do anything with it under Guest (I can't access them and unload files onto them to create some space).\nI feel like I'm really up a wall here and am unsure of what more to do.\nAny ideas or recommendations?\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: Okay, fixed the issue.\nI had to go in using ctrl + alt + f2 and logged into my account.  I then deleted my dropbox folder (to free enough space, which was around 800mb).  \nAt that point, I did a sudo apt-get -f install which allowed me to finish downloaded LaTex.\nOnce it was fully downloaded, it told me there were dependency issues, so I uninstalled it using sudo apt-get remove tex-common and then a sudo apt-get autoremove to finish it off.\nOnce that was finally out of the way, I could then run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, and then sudo apt-get update.\nWent back to the login screen, put in my password, and I was back in.  \nFrustrating, but taken care of.

I've modified my old .desktop file located in ~/.local/share/applications, then added it to my launcher and now it looks like this: \n\n\nHow can I fix this?\nFor reference, here's my eclipse.desktop file:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nPath=/home/jinkim/eclipse\nIcon=/home/jinkim/eclipse/icon.xpm\nExec=/home/jinkim/eclipse/eclipse\nName=Eclipse Luna\nComment=This is an IDE\nIcon=eclipse\n\n\nA: It seems there a line in the .desktop file that I was missing. In particular, the crucial line seems to be:\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse\n\nMore info on that here: What represent the StartupWMClass field of a .desktop file?\n\nSo, I have found what works for me below: \n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse\nGenericName=Eclipse Java IDE\nComment=Eclipse Java IDE\nCategories=Utility;Developer Tools;IDEs;Java;\nExec=/home/(your-username-here)/eclipse/eclipse\nIcon=/home/(your-username-here)/eclipse/icon.xpm\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nX-GNOME-FullName=Eclipse Java IDE\n\nThe steps I took to get this working are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a text editor to create eclipse.desktop, and paste the above into it\n\n*Move eclipse.desktop into ~/.local/share/applications\n\n*Allow it to be executable: chmod +x eclipse.desktop\n\n*Double-click eclipse.desktop which should appear in Nautilus as Eclipse\n\n*In Unity launcher, right-click and select \"Lock to Launcher\"\n\nA: I had this same problem of duplicated icon.\nbut in my case it was caused because I double clicked in the eclipse executable and ask unit to lock it in the launcher.  this action makes unity to create an eclipse.desktop file into ~/.local/share/applications where its \"exec=\" was set to java instead of eclipse executable.\nAfter I removed the one created by unity and added my own, the problem was solved.\n\nA: Depending on how you installed Eclipse and which distribution you chose, you may find the StartupWMClass needs a different value (Use the xprop WM_CLASS method described in the link in Jin's answer above).\nHaving built a custom Eclipse from the Platform Runtime distribution, I was getting an extra \"No Entry\" icon with \"SWT\" as its caption. Using xprop WM_CLASS told me the class is called \"SWT\", and setting StartupWMClass=SWT resolves the problem.\n", "Q: Execute command with relative (upper) path. Using another working directory I need to run an application (msp430-gcc) using a relative path from a makefile. The issue is that the application is in a different folder branch so I need to do something like this:\n../../../../tools/msp430/bin/msp430-gcc\n\nHere the problem is that the system is unable to find the application. However, if I do:\ncd ../../../../tools/msp430/bin\n./msp430-gcc\n\nthen it works.\nDo you know how I could run the application from my initial location without using \"cd\"?\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nA: The keywords here is: running command with different working directory. You can google it yourself to find more information.\nYou can call it using parentheses - ()\n$ (cd ../../../../tools/msp430/bin &&./msp430-gcc)\n\nParentheses will create a new subshell to execute commands inside it. This new subshell will change directory and execute program in this directory. \nQuote from man bash\n(list)    list  is  executed  in  a  subshell  environment (see COMMAND\n          EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT below).  Variable assignments and builtin \n          commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in \n          effect after the command completes.  The return status is the\n          exit status of list.\n\nwhere a list is just a normal sequence of commands.\nVariables in a subshell are not visible outside the block of code in the subshell.\nThey are not accessible to the parent process, to the shell that launched the\nsubshell. These are, in effect, local variables. \nDirectory changes made in a subshell do not carry over to the parent shell.\n\nIn conclusion: subshell will see all variables from parent shell, but it will use them as local. Changes made by subshell to variables not affect parent shell\n\nAnother method using sh:\n$ sh -c 'cd ../../../../tools/msp430/bin; ./msp430-gcc'\n\nIn this case sh -c will not spawn subshell, but create own new shell. That's why it cannot see parent shell variables. So remember: if you set some variable before executing sh -c new shell will not see it.\nBut there is also a little confuse between using single quotes '' and double quotes \"\" in sh -c. See this question to understand difference, I will only show little example:\n$ TEST=test1\n$ sh -c 'echo $TEST'\n\n$ sh -c 'TEST=test2;echo $TEST'\ntest2\n\nafter executing first command nothing was printed out. It's because new shell do not have TEST variable, and '' do not expand $TEST.\n$ sh -c \"echo $TEST\"\ntest1\n$ sh -c \"TEST=test2;echo $TEST\"\ntest1\n\nhere first command $TEST was expanded because of using \"\", and even if we set TEST variable in new shell $TEST already expanded, and it printed out test1\n\nSources\n\n\n*\n\n*About sh -c \"command\". Very full answer.\n\n*About parentheses\n\n*Similar question\n\n*From bash guide about parentheses\n\n*Difference between '' and \"\"\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu really run all Windows programs? I recently stumbled over the Ubuntu for Tablets video, where Mark Shuttleworth presents how Ubuntu is going to look on tablets.\nHowever, he said one thing that struck me at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h384z7Ph0gU&t=5m15s. He said that Ubuntu could run \"all Windows apps\".\nHow does this work? Was he talking about Wine (which definitely can't run every Windows program) or did he mean something else?\n\nA: He said: \"all Windows apps as a thin client\". Since \"thin clients\" usually involve program execution elsewhere, presumably this means via remote desktop or something similar. And the Ubuntu for Android page mentions Citrix thin clients.\n\nA: And of course you can run a licensed version of Windows as a guest OS in a Virtual Machine using Ubuntu as the host (which I guess would sort of be cheating because you are running Windows and not Ubuntu ;). This will work with most Windows programs, but you can occasionally run into issues with application licensing that won't run in a VM and/or hardware requirements that can't be satisfied by the VM.\n\nA: As you wrote in your question, Wine definitely can't run every Windows program. You can search for a particular Windows application at the WineHQ website, and it will tell you whether that application is supported by Wine. If the Windows application is supported by Wine, WineHQ will also show a rating (Garbage/Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum) of how well that application runs on Wine.\n", "Q: AMD APU-A4-5000 processor issue I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Toshiba Satellite C50D-A 40010 Laptop (PSCGYG-00J00J).

This is something like a CPU with automatic frequency regulation. However, if the driver is missing, the APU can't know how much is needed of it and will therefore stay at its minimum ever.\nYou can solve this by installing the proprietary AMD Graphics driver fglrx.\nOpen Software & Updates (via Dash or System Settings), go to Additional Drivers, and choose the option saying fglrx for your Graphics card. It may take some time to install. After a reboot, the APU should adapt its frequency as needed, and you have better options for your Graphics via the newly installed AMD Catalyst Control Center.\n", "Q: How to set subl:// protocol handler with Unity?

The best is to only copy the application launchers to other users, since the other ones can be user specific and / or vary during the process.\nAlso note that if you copy a launcher's content to another user, possible local .desktop files (in ~/.local/share/applications) of locally installed applications for example, will not appear in the other user's Unity launcher.\nReading the current launcher's content\nHaving said that, you can read the current launcher's content by the command:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nThe output is a list of all items from your current Unity launcher.\nSetting a new launcher's content\nTo set a new content for the launcher, the following command is used:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites <list_of_items>\n\nUsing a script to copy the launcher to another user's account\nIf we use a script to fetch the launcher items of the first user, write the result to a file, then log into the another user's account to run the script again (together with the file) to set the content into other user's account, it can be done in no time.

The colors on the screen change around and there is no control via the mouse. Alt-T doesn't bring up a terminal. Nothing helps except pushing on the power off button.\nI think it may be connected to Firefox since I always have Firefox on in gmail. I was looking at a MOOC in a different tab when a new mail came in and the system crashed the first time.\nI didn't think too much of it and got the system back up and naturally turned on Firefox and gmail. Now I was looking at a movie when it crashed again. Again I brought up Firefox and continued on with the movie. Again it crashed. Now I had enough of Firefox so I finished the movie with no Firefox and no troubles.\nThis is too difficult to try and pin down so I just wanted to ask if anyone else has had troubles very recently. I put up a system monitor so I could see the use of the CPU. When it crashed the colors would change as usual, but the system monitor would no longer track the CPU usage. So it is more than just the mouse doesn't respond.\nThese are the only clues I have. Again, is anyone else having troubles?\nThanks,\nIlan\nP.S. I added the tag 13.04 instead of 14.04 by mistake.

Consider something like this:\nfind . -name test -prune -o -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \\; -o -type f -execdir chmod 600 {} +\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*-name test -prune: -prune, if the tests before it are true, and the current file is a directory, skip it, else return false.\n\n*-o -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \\;: if -prune returns false, then these options are applied (as -o is OR), and this applies chmod 700 if the file is a directory.\n\n*-o -type f -execdir chmod 600 {} +: if both the above tests return false, then apply chmod 600 as it's not a directory. execdir is \"a much more secure method for invoking commands\", according to the manpage, which also gives the reasons.\n\n", "Q: Terminal Transparency in Ubuntu GNOME Malfunctions I recently installed ubuntu GNOME and I have done all the updates and upgrades.

Read it below from Allan Day :\n\nI've spoken to Christian and he has filled me in on the background to\n  this issue.\nThe ability to set background transparency was removed as\n  a part of a much larger clean up of the gnome-terminal code base. This\n  modernisation effort is much needed and it should be remembered that\n  the terminal has an old and complicated code base. Background\n  transparency was also known to cause a range of performance issues,\n  including slowness and memory leaks. \nGiven the number of active terminal developers, the need to clean up the code base and known bugs\n  with background transparency, it was decided that the resources were\n  not available to maintain background transparency and keep the quality\n  to the required level. \nWe understand that some users are disappointed\n  by the disappearance of this feature, and we hope that they understand\n  that this decision was made to enable other improvements to the\n  terminal code, and that it will lead to other improvements in the long\n  run. While Christian’s initial response could have been better, he has\n  responded in detail in private mail and I suspect that he was simply\n  tired of the issue.\n\nSource: Bug 698544, Comment #45\nSolution:\nHowever, I have found a resolution to this issue by installing terminator sudo apt-get install terminator \n\n\nDone\n", "Q: Upgraded this morning, now stuck with no X login So... have had a fully functional Ubuntu 14.04 system installed dual-boot with Win 7 on my Lenovo T530 ThinkPad for months... 12.10, 13.04 & 13.10 before that.

So I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my netbook and was going through the things to do to optimize my SSD (https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/ssd) Steps 5 and 6 tell me to partition it to have 7% unallocated space and to make sure it is formatted to ext4. \nI opened Gparted and it is not allowing me to split my partitions to add unallocated space, also it looks as though it is formatted to ext2 and I am unaware of how to change it. My partitions in Gparted look as follows:\n\nAny help on these issues?\n\nA: My suggestion: start over with a clean install and choose those options from the get go. \nThere IS a way to convert ext2 to ext4 but it is a bit involved. If this is a brand new install, might just be easier to start over. \nLikewise, you can resize your partition but not when it's mounted (i.e. you are booted into it). Use the Gparted livecd or liveusb\n\nA: Do not encrypt your entire root. If you need to, encrypt only /home. It's probably the encryption that's blocking things in GParted. \n\nA: Warning: Before performing any partitioning operation (e.g. resizing), make sure you have your data backed up somewhere other than the disk you're using.\nThe problem is that you're trying to resize the partition Ubuntu is running off of. The little key icon next to /dev/sda1 indicates that you can't do anything with that partition, as it's mounted (in use).\nIn order to resize the partition, you'll need to use a Live USB or CD. If you still have the one used to installed Ubuntu on that computer, it will work.\nFollow the same steps as before (installed GParted, etc). This time, the key icon will be gone, and you'll be able to resize the partition.\n", "Q: Cannot get nginx to render my WordPress site I am new to nginx but I followed religiously all the tutorials and tried to setup my WordPress site but I have an issue at the moment I cannot resolve.

I don't have hard line access. \nFortunately I kept an old usb stick around with Ubuntu 10.10 which CAN access the internet through WiFi. The problem is I don't have access to a router now to get the drivers.\nThe last time I installed Ubuntu, I found that the wireless drivers  I need are proprietary, and aren't included by default. Without access to the router, I can't download them because I only get internet through wireless. \nEssentially, I need internet to fix the internet. \nThe installation of Ubuntu 10.10 on the USB still has the wireless drivers on it, because I made the image persistent. \nIs there some way I could transfer the wireless drivers from the USB to the Ubuntu 14.04 installation on the hard drive?\n\nA: Solved!! This question: Can I add a proprietary wireless driver to a liveUSB stick? basically answers it. The user daffydack said that the driver IS ACTUALLY ON THE INSTALLATION MEDIUM. So I reinstalled a few times and with a few different versions and still couldn't get wireless... but the last time I interrupted an installation causing it to go to the live cd / test phase. Then I looked at the additional drivers thing and still couldn't get them. Then I closed it and opened it. Then like a few minutes later it just popped up. So I installed the drivers and attempted to install the os assuming the changes to the live environment would carry over. Then it wouldn't install the os. Then I cancelled that and did some googling. Then in one last ditch effort tried the install again. And here I am in a fresh new install. Btw if someone reads this please tell me, is it always such a pain in the butt trying to install ubuntu or am I just cursed? I always have problems. You would think with the amount of development that has gone into other areas of this project that the foundations (booting installing etc) would be pretty solid... :s\n", "Q: checkinstall failing to install debian package I'm trying to install sip for pyqt and trying to get checkinstall to work.

Does it mean that /dev/sdd1 belongs to /dev/sdd? Is such a device what is referred to in the notes given above the list of devices?\n\nNote: it is possible to install GRUB to partition boot records as well, and some appropriate partitions are offered here. However, this forces GRUB to use the blocklist mechanism, which makes it less reliable, and therefore is not recommended.\n\n\nA: The reason that line is indented is to show that sdd1 is a partition within the physical device sdd. sda ... sdd are physical drives as seen by the operating system. sdd1 is a partition of a physical drive, namely the physical drive sdd. The hyphen and offset are meant to highlight this fact in order to make it clear.\n", "Q: shell script not running on terminal I created a scriptA.sh on the desktop and make it executable then this was it content:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo -u userA bash -c 'PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1; cd /home/userA/scripts'\n\nI want to double click on this to open terminal and run the two commands in it and keep terminal opened. But what actually happens after double clicking it and choosing to run with terminal option, the terminal opens for a second and then closes itself. I don't know why this is happening, so I'd appreciate if anyone could please advise why this is happening and how to overcome it.\n\nA: You probably want to use gksudo if you want to start it from your Desktop. That will open a window asking you for your password.\n#!/bin/bash\ngksudo -u userA bash -c 'PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1; cd /home/userA/scripts'\n\nAlso to debug, you probably want to run that script in your terminal first. That way it will not close just after printing some error messages.\n\nUpdate\nOne way to do that is to create a file as follow:\n/home/user_name/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers/script_name.desktop\n\nThen put something like this in it:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon[en_US]=gdu-category-peripheral\nName[en_US]=Receiving fax\nExec=gksu /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\nComment[en_US]=Some description...\nName=My Script\nComment=Start my script\nIcon=gnome-panel-launcher\n\nThat works great for me, in general. The gnome-terminal accepts parameters so you can change various settings.\nUse --working-directory=... instead of your cd ... command. To get specific variables, you probably want to use the --profile=... option.\nExec=gksu -u userA /usr/bin/gnome-terminal --profile=/home/userA/profile --working-directory=/home/userA/scripts\n\nThen create the profile script for the variable:\n# In /home/userA/profile\nPACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1\n\nObviously you could add any other alias or anything else you need in the profile script.\n\nA: By default, when you choose the option to \"run in a terminal window\", the (gnome-) terminal window closes after it is finished. It does open, since you mention it opens for a second. You can make it stay open by changing the setting it in your terminal profile:\nFrom the (gnome-terminal) menu, choose \"Edit\" > \"Profile Settings\" > \"Title and Command\". In the option \"When command exits\" choose \"Hold the terminal open\".\nThat should work.\n\n", "Q: completly removing a package of this kind hi I was trying to configure my laptop and went online trying to figure out about things to do after installing Ubuntu 14.04.

However, I don't want any menu asking to select Ubuntu or something else or that it boots into Ubuntu by default. I also don't want to run it in a VM, because  want to run it natively, without any performance-hogging Windows in the way.\nMy system is UEFI enabled and I'm afraid that it won't let me install any other OS. So basically, I need a way to dual boot a Windows 8 machine with Ubuntu, get around UEFI, and still have it boot to Windows by default.\n\nA: You're lucky as you have UEFI. (I seriously never thought I'd ever say that lol). Ubuntu supports SecureBoot/UEFI.\nInstall Ubuntu as normal. It should detect the UEFI configuration.\nOnce it's done, boot into your BIOS configuration and change the boot order. Move Windows further up and move Ubuntu down. The UEFI system will automatically boot into Windows instead of using GRUB2.\nFor you to boot into Ubuntu, simply enter the BIOS settings again and use the Boot Override menu. It can also be called Select boot device... or similar.\n\nThis works because UEFI uses boot files instead of a MBR. There can be multiple bootloaders on a single drive.\nA standard EFI boot partition has the following (simplified) file scheme:\nEFI\n|\n|--> UBUNTU\n|     |\n|     |--> grub2.efi\n|\n|\n|--> Windows\n      |\n      |--> win32.efi\n\nThe EFI bootloader is (by default) trying to do this:\n 1. Check for the UBUNTU folder, and try to boot from the `grub2.efi` file.\n 2. Check for the Windows folder, and try to boot from the `win32.efi` file.\n\nYou can change the order so it looks for Windows first. Once the boot succeeds, it will not continue trying to use bootable EFI files. If you set Windows first (and it works), Windows will boot without GRUB ever being seen. You can then manually override this by using the Select Boot File... option/key/decoder ring/sacrifice/UEFI setting.\nConsult the documentation that came with your computer for the proper settings, keycombination, and/or the right mixture of blood. I do not know these off-hand.\n\nA: What you could do is have a thumb drive that you insert when you wish to boot into Ubuntu.\nThis is just a bit of a rough idea, so bear with me.\nSo, you would leave it with the Windows-installed MBR/EFI config on the hard drive, and set up your BIOS to prefer booting from USB when available.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu to a partition on your hard drive as normal, and if you do it with the installer it'll probably install Grub etc. \n\n*Boot into Ubuntu.  Use grub-install to install another Grub boot loader onto a USB stick.  That Grub boot loader will still use the partitions on your hard drive as its data and to boot into.\n\n*Then you can remove the Grub boot loader from the hard drive, restoring back to Windows' own MBR (or EFI if using EFI) using the Windows boot disc to do a boot recovery or whatever they call it.\n\nA: If you have 2 hard disks available, you could simply set it to boot to the Windows drive, and go into the BIOS to boot Ubuntu.\nI don't know if it is possible to make grub \"silent\" and still boot to Ubuntu through it somehow.\nOr you could just ask your sister and show her what to do if you install it. It isn't hard and takes less than 1 minute.\n\nA: Entering the UEFI BIOS and changeing order does not work, UEFI does not save the order, it let you change order but at reboot order is reset back to what it wants, not to what user has input.\nSo i need to press F12 on each to select what to boot.\nMaybe next time, this helps others to understand a little deeper why people asks (not all people see that order is not saved).\ni discovered by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Entering UEFI at boot\n\n*Change order\n\n*Use the option called \"Save changes and reboot\"\n\n*Entering again in UEFI \n\n*Ugly see order is not saved\n\n\nHope there is some way (externally)... i kown it is (i do it on the past), but i do not remember now what i did... it was related to mounting EFI partition (maybe with a Linux LiveCD) and doing something with files, but not sure what i exactly i did.\n", "Q: Chromium window stickiness Sorry in advance if this is not the correct place to post this, but I couldn't find an asklubuntu forum :D\nWhen I'm using Chromium (and it's only Chromium that I know of), and I switch to another workspace (\"Desktop\" in Lubuntu) the Chromium window \"sticks\" to the next workspace. I've shown a screenshot. \nDoes anyone know how I might fix this? \n\nA: Well I will not count this as an aswer, as it does not solve your issue. Alas, I do not have enough reputation (which is understandable) to add comments. From my little knowledge on Lubuntu (well, Linux) I would suggest the following: \nsudo apt-get remove chromium \n\nThen follow up with an update: \nsudo apt-get update\n\nFinally, re-install the app with:\nsudo apt-get install chromium \n\nFailing that, would you be able to test the same processese whilst booting from a Live USB? That may help identify if it is an issue with your install, or hardware. \nAdding to the above (this is an \"updated\"), if all works well running via the USB, then chances are it has something to do with the configuration of the OS. It should do the same on the LiveUSB (as it uses the same hardware). \nIt may just be the software, either Lubunutu or Chromium.

If anyone can please tell me how after openening the terminal through this script.sh to run in it some other commands.\nThis is is my script.sh file:\n#!/bin/bash\ngksu -u userA /usr/bin/gnome-terminal PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1; cd /home/userA/scripts\n\nso the first command gksu -u userA /usr/bin/gnome-terminal opens a terminal instance, I'm asking how to run the two following commands PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1 and cd /home/userA/scripts in this opened terminal instance using the script.sh\nEDIT:\nafter applying muru's suggestion this is what I used:\ngnome-terminal -x sudo -u userA bash -c 'PPACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1:/home/userA/package2:$PACKAGE_PATH; cd /home/userA/scripts; source varset.sh; bash' \nbut it is not run in the same sequence I put it.\nThe first line appears in the terminal is a message which is found in variables.sh (although this should be the third command to run) and the other thing is that none of the variables that should be set using this varset.sh is set, for example when I use echo $var1 (which is found in variables.sh) is display nothing which means the variables is not set the only thing that works in variables.sh is the echo message displayed.\nThe second line that appears in the  the directory is the terminal working directory which is set to the /home/userA/scripts.\nThe third thing is that this command PACKAGE_PATH=PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1:/home/userA/package2:$PACKAGE_PATH which sets the $PACKAGE_PATH variable is not working.\nSo if anyone could please advise how to run this command in this sequence and to set the variables on the first command and variables in the varset.sh shell file.\n\nA: I'd suggested the following as a way to keep the shell open:\ngnome-terminal -x sudo -u userA bash -c 'PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1:/home/userA/package2:$PACKAGE_PATH; \\\n  cd /home/userA/scripts; \\\n  source varset.sh; \\\n  bash'\n\nHowever, the last bash won't be affected by the assignment of $PACKAGE_PATH or from source varset.sh if they aren't exported.\nSo: \ngnome-terminal -x sudo -u userA bash -c 'export PACKAGE_PATH=/home/userA/package1:/home/userA/package2:$PACKAGE_PATH; \\\n  cd /home/userA/scripts; \\\n  source varset.sh; \\\n  bash'\n\nwith varset.sh exported should do the trick.\n", "Q: How to manipulate files in external hard drive using terminal?

When it got complaint I removed its hard drive and started using it as external hard disk. It has an 80 GB of memory allocation for the windows C drive partition. But now i don't need that partition anymore. But the problem is I am not able to access that drive to paste files into it. How can I make read and write permission to this drive using terminal?\n\nA: 1. This is an ok technique for files ON an external drive, but is the correct technique for files you just copied onto your computer FROM an external drive\nThis works: recursively (-R) change the username (the part before the colon :) and groupname (the part after the colon :) to your username:\nNote: be patient: for large amounts of data this can take many minutes. I just performed the following command on a directory on a high-speed internal SSD containing 966 GB of data (as shown by du -sh) and 10.6 million files (as shown by find . | wc -l) and it took 4 minutes.\n# format: \n# sudo chown -R username_of_new_owner:groupname_of_new_owner path/to/dir\nsudo chown -R username:username /media/username/nameofdrive\n\nBUT, the problem with this is that it makes the external disk difficult to share between multiple usernames and/or on multiple computers, because each person on each system who needs access to these files must either have the same username, or must be part of the same groupname. Having the same username only works if it is the same person, so that doesn't always make sense. Having the same groupname is okay if it is consistently the same people using the drive, and they all add themselves to the same group with:\nusermod -a -G groupname\n\nBUT, if the groupname doesn't exist on one system, and just shows up as a number, such as 5000, when you look at it with ll (ls -alF), then you can't easily add yourself to the same group because usermod -a -G 5000 produces this error:\n$ usermod -a -G 5000\nusermod: group '5000' does not exist\n\n2. Sometimes better for files ON an external drive\nSo, that leads us to this solution: just give full permissions to these files to everyone:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /media/username/nameofdrive\n\nBUT, that also marks ALL files as executable, which doesn't really make sense. You don't want to arbitrarily mark every single file as executable, as that can pose a security risk, and also be annoying when every time you double-click a text file to open and edit it, it asks you if you'd like to run/execute it.\n3. Better still #1 (or best, if you DO need write permissions for everyone) for files ON an external drive\nSo, that leads me to my recommendation: give full permissions to everyone (-a, or 'a'll), but only set the executable bit (ie: use +X, NOT +x) if it is either a directory, OR already set for one or more of \"user\", \"group\", or \"other\", like this:\nsudo chmod -R a+rwX /media/username/nameofdrive\n\nman chmod says about the capital X versus lower-case x option:\n\n...execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X),...\n\n4. Better still #2 (or best, if you do NOT need write permissions for everyone, ie: if read is enough) for files ON an external drive\nBUT, even better still, if you can get away with it: if you don't really need guaranteed write permissions for everyone, just ensure you have at least read permissions for everyone on the drive, like this:\nsudo chmod -R a+rX /media/username/nameofdrive\n\nThen, apply permissions -R a+rwX only AFTER copying the files to your local machine from the external drive:\ncp -r /media/username/nameofdrive/some_dir ~/some_local_path\n# Now add `w`rite for everyone\nsudo chmod -R a+rwX ~/some_local_path\n# OR (even better!): just make yourself the owner now that it's on your local\n# drive:\nsudo chown -R username:username ~/some_local_path\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/454795/how-can-i-do-a-recursive-chmod-only-on-directories/454807#454807\n\n*[my repo/file: search this file for chmod to find a bunch of my personal chmod examples here] eRCaGuy_dotfiles/git & Linux cmds, help, tips & tricks - Gabriel.txt\nRelated\n\n*\n\n*[my answer] https://superuser.com/questions/1271882/convert-ntfs-partition-to-ext4-how-to-copy-the-data/1464264#1464264\n\nA: If you want to gain ownership of a drive you can use the chown command:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/username/nameofdrive\n\nThis gives the user ownership over the drive to the current user without allowing permission to unauthorized users and -R makes this command recursive so that ownership also applies to all of the existing individual files on the drive as well and not just the drive itself.\nYou can also use -R to make chmod recursive as well.\nTo assign ownership permission to a different user and or group, just replace $USER:$USER with whatever username:groupname or username:username you wish to assign ownership to.\n\nA: The drives will be located in /media/username folder. Goto that directory using cd command. And then on terminal\nsudo chmod 777 nameofdrive\n\n777 assigns read,write and execute permissions to all users.\n", "Q: How do I totally remove grub and install it fresh so it works? (dual boot problem) Okay, so here it goes. I have two hard drives. One is a 1TB drive that I have Win 7 on, the other is a 250GB that I have Ubuntu on. Both installs work fine, neither is corrupted. I installed Win 7 Ultimate first because I know it screws up grub on a system with Ubuntu installed first. Then after I got it pretty much totally set up, I restarted because of updates. Then, with it restarting, I installed Ubuntu on the other drive by letting it install what it needed automatically. When I restarted, it went to grub, of course. However, that's when I noticed the problem. There was no entry for Windows. I restarted onto the Boot Repair live disk (results at http://paste.ubuntu.com/8405452) but it seems to have cloned the failed grub from the other disk to the Windows hard drive, as that one only sees Ubuntu as well.\nHow do I completely remove grub and then install it as fresh?

I have ubuntu 12.04 and I would like to install manjaro linux. Whenever I use the ImageWriter, my pendrive does  not mount. When I check it in gparted, I see that there is no partition table. I create a partition table and then format it to a fat32 filesystem. How do I make it bootable? Thank you\n\nA: First, unmount the pendrive. The format doesn't matter, because you're going to blow it away. \nFrom a terminal window, issue the command:\n    sudo ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/*usb*\n\nThis will display your USB devices attached to your computer. Note that it will not only list the hardware device (e.g. \"sdd\") but will also list partitions on this device (e.g. \"sdd1\"). What you want is the hardware device, 3 letters with no trailing digit. That is your usbdevice for the following command.\nTo load the iso file to your pendrive, enter the command\n    sudo dd if=isofilename of=usbdev bs=4M; sync\n\nwhere isofilename is the name of the Manjaro iso filename with extension, and usbdev is the 3-character USB device identified from the previous command.\nThis will take a bit to transfer, so be patient and check your email. When it is done, you can reboot to your pendrive, which will be a live version of Manjaro so you can check it out. If it doesn't boot to your pendrive, you'll need to reboot and enter your BIOS and reconfigure your boot sequence to put the pendrive ahead of your hard drive(s). You can also install to your hard drive from this live version, either by GUI or command line. I had problems with the GUI, but the command line interface worked fine. It can do it automatically, or you can manually configure it. \nI use an LVM, and set up my logical volumes ahead of time to install it to, and did a manual installation. The installation went flawlessly, but I had a problem booting with a separate /usr mount volume, that the underlying Arch Linux had a problem with, but I was able to solve that with guidance from the Manjaro forum pages.\nI also made separate logical volumes for my music, my pictures, and my data files, so I can mount them to either my Manjaro or Ubuntu distros, or any others I might install in the future. I had to add these separate volumes manually to my fstab file.\nYou can use the same command sequence to load any Linux distro iso file to your pendrive. I made a script file with prompts and testing to make sure I didn't mess anything up. If you dd to the wrong drive, you could mess up your working distro (you have done a backup recently, right?).\n", "Q: What version of \"mysql-connector-java\" to include in pom.xml for ubuntu 14.04 The mysql server version installed is 5.5.38 as verified by \nsanchit@sanchit-3560:/$ mysql --version\nmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.38, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 6.3\n\nBut in the official maven repository page the latest version is 5.1.32.

I have not been able to find a pattern in this behavior.\nI think these issues are connected with one root cause because they happen under the same conditions and both show strange graphic issues.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and I'm on the fglrx-updates driver. My video card is a Sapphire R7 240 2GB.\nAny ideas or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: These issues continued to plague me for over 1,5 years. As it turns out, switching to the open source AMD video drivers (via the Proprietary drivers screen) fixed these issues and a variety of other issues such as rendering issues in Google Chrome for me.\nThe proprietary AMD drivers just don't seem to work properly.\n", "Q: NVidia driver, normal boot results in blank screen, recovery boot works fine Ok, so, like many others I'm having a lot of trouble with NVidia drivers, in this case, the new 340.32 ones downloaded from here (http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html), but I've had these problems across the board with pretty much all versions.\nSo, this is currently where I'm at, as far as I can tell, the driver is installed fine, but if I let Ubuntu try to boot normally, I end up at a blank screen and nothing ends up getting displayed.  No run level changes work, it's completely locked up, yadda yadda.\nIf I boot into recovery mode and then resume the boot (with no other changes, I literally just hit \"resume boot\"), everything seems to work fine.\nSo I'm assuming that something is starting up with a regular boot that doesn't start up with a recovery boot (there is, obviously, a warning for such when resuming the boot), but I have no idea what or how to diagnose it.\nHere's the other major symptom, nvidia-settings launches fine & I can save the xorg.conf file in /etc/X11 with no problem (without merging). However, when I perform a recovery boot, the system has lost any of the changes I made to the configuration, so I'm guessing something isn't reading the xorg file or something like that.\nUbuntu 14.04, kernel 36.\nNVidia drivers 340.32 (but happens with all versions that I've tried, even back to 3.04)\n2x EVGA NVidia 780 GTX (connected with an SLI bridge) with 2 WQHD Monitors both driven from Card 0, plus an Oculus Rift DK2 that I keep disabling from NVidia Settings but which keeps showing up as active every time I reboot (the problem predates the Rift, so I suspect this is a symptom and not a cause).\nAny ideas? How do I even begin to figure out what's tripping the damned thing up on boot?\nThanks.\n\nA: This could be fixed by adding the nomodeset value to the grub boot options. To do so open the file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nthen look for the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nThe quiet splash options may or may not be there, and there may be additional options, don't touch those and add to the end of it nomodeset\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nSave the file and exit gedit, then update grub's configuration in the following way:\nsudo update-grub\n\nSource: happened to me\n\nA: Ok, so it seems this is actually less to do with the NVidia cards and more to do with the fact that I'm using an SSD as a system drive.\nAs I understand it, the problem is that it's trying to start lightdm before the video card has finished initializing or some such nonsense.\nIt's a big problem on Macs;\nhttps://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/573252/linux/evo-push-buffer-channel-allocation-failed-is-back-as-usedplib-false-no-more-supported-with-325-15/4/\nI've tried a LOT of fixes related to the EVO Buffer problem, but it seems that most of them don't work with Ubuntu.\nSeems the only thing that works is to deliberately give the system time to catch up before trying to launch lightdm.\nSo, in /etc/init.d/lightdm.conf, locate the line that says:\nexec lightdm\n\n.. and simply change it to:\nsleep 2\nexec lightdm\n\nIt's an ugly, kludgy fix, but I have no idea how to go about telling lightdm to wait for the cards.\nIncidentally, not sure what the fix for the xorg.conf file was, I'd read that copying it to /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d was more reliable and that setting the screens using the Ubuntu display manager was more reliable.\nI did both, one of them worked, but I couldn't tell you which one.\n\nA: I had similar problems with the NVIDIA driver initially in my machine. I switched to NVIDIA's legacy driver version 173.1439. It seems a lot more stable in two weeks of use. I found it as the second choice in Software & Updates – Additional drivers.

When you remove the application the dependency will stay on your system.\nSo apt-get autoremove will remove those dependencies that were installed with applications and are no longer used by anything else on the system.\n\nis there any advantages of using this command over something like Bleachbit or Ubuntu Tweak janitor?\n\n\n*\n\n*Bleachbit or Ubuntu Tweak janitor are graphical interfaces.\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove is a command\n\nUsing one option does not exclude the other: I would assume BB and UTJ use  sudo apt-get autoremove (in some sort of way) to remove dependencies. So it is not a question of \"any advantages.\" It is a matter of preference: are you a command line type of person or are you a GUI type of person?\nBy the way: deborphan is another tool to clean your system.\n\nA: One minor addition: Since 14.04 you may actually write apt autoremove to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies.\nThese two commands are equivalent: \n\n\n*\n\n*apt autoremove \n\n*apt-get autoremove\n", "Q: Is there a way to check which font your shell/terminal emulator is using from the commandline?

different laptops, both running Ubuntu 14.04 64bits (actually one of them is running Xubuntu, but that's basically the same).\nBoth these laptops show the exact same behavior with the VPN randomly disconnecting after logging something like \"closing control connection due to missing echo reply\" to syslog.\nI also have a small netbook on which I've installed #!11 (which still runs kernel 3.2 btw). With the exact same config the VPN here has not disconnected for a little over 10 hours and the only reason it disconnected from the VPN is because I told it to.\nSo.. could this be a Ubuntu 14.04 problem? or a Kernel problem? or a lib version problem?\n\nA: Chances are the VPN server doesn't support some compression features. If the server is windows based, try to disable PPP Echo packets sending, also disabling BSD compression, Deflate compression and TCP header compression might solve the problem. If the issue persists, DNS error might be the culprit.\n", "Q: workspace switcher in Ubuntu 14.04Lts How do I get a small \"thumbnail\" of Workspace switcher on my launcher using which I can view all my windows and click and open any one of them in Ubuntu 14.04LTS?\n\nA: If you have workspace enabled then the launcher shows an icon for Workspace Switcher.\nA better idea will be to use shortcut super + s, this displays all the workspaces, you can chose and select even using the arrow keys.\nAnother solution will be to install Unity Tweak and set up the hot corners if you want to use the mouse so much.\n", "Q: List of available wi-fi networks does not show up.

For some strange reason no additional steps were required after solely creating the partition. The additional grub steps for converting Ubuntu into UEFI mode weren't needed. Just converting Ubuntu into Legacy mode wasn't an option because the bios_grub flag wasn't available anywhere (Ubuntu live boot with gparted, stand-alone gparted live disc, etc.).\n\nA: I had the same issue with my computer. a Toshiba C55. the UEFI required an initial 1G partition.

My solution was just to compile without documentation, per the links above)\n", "Q: Can I configure networkmanager to set up a VPN (vpnc) connection that uses \"IPSec obfuscated secret\"?

It does not look like it is possible to use \"obfuscated secret\" in the configuration GUI.

I have been using easy peasy 1.6 on my old EeePC 1001 HA. Things are working well. The only thing, the updating software seems not to be working. \nThat is why I am looking for another ubuntu version that is up to date, easy to use and fast.\nWhat version do you recommend ? \nHere are the specs : \nCPU & Chipset\nIntel® Atom™ N270\nMemory\nDDR2 SO-DIMM 1GB\nWireless Data Network\nWLAN 802.11b/g/n @2.4GHz\nThanks  \n\nA: I just helped my brother get an old Eee PC 1015PE updating again even though it is running an obsolete version of Ubuntu. The trick is to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change every reference to *.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com. You won't get security updates or the latest software, but it can postpone having to consider a complete OS upgrade.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14 no way to install Nvidia drivers or get suspend working I'm trying to get an \"old\" Acer Aspire 5720 operative with Ubuntu 14.04 but the proprietary drivers nor suspend work properly.\nMy hardware configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core Duo T5250 @ 1,5Ghz\n\n*4GB DDR2 RAM\n\n*Nvidia GeForce 8400M GS 256MB\n\n*Kingston ssdNow V300 120GB\n\n\nI've tried legacy drivers ver.173, removing bumblebee, removing nouveau, resetting xorg.conf file, but nothing changes.\nMy aim is to get suspend working, but with nouveau installed when resuming from suspension the only thing I get is a message saying \"nouveau fault\", with nvidia drivers instead I get a black screen.\nIs it a kernel bug, a driver bug, or is it just my fault?\n\nA: Finally solved! It turned out that the Nvidia GeForce 8400M GS (luckily installed as an MXM card instead of being soldered on motherboard) was defective as many other 8400M, I did the oven trick, now it works flawlessly with full hardware acceleration.\n\nThe oven trick consists of removing the defective MXM GPU module and leaving it into the oven at 200°C for 10 minutes (maybe with some SMD flux under the GPU BGA, but it worked fine for me even without flux).\n", "Q: What does a file that is dark grey in linux mean? From this question on the forum Color Code Files, I learned that some colors mean different things on linux. However, in the answer there wasn't a reference to a file that was dark grey. Here is a picture of a file directory:\n\nWhat does the grey color mean? I was just wondering out of curiosity. Does it normally have a special meaning, or is this simply just a color scheme setting particular to my environment?\n\nA: Run ls --color=always | less and you'll see the raw colour codes. Eg:\nESC[0mESC[01;34macESC[0m\nESC[01;34mbinESC[0m\nESC[01;34mBioWareESC[0m\n\nIt's a bit of a mess but in these cases, they're all 01;34.\nThen all you need to do is look in $LS_COLORS for that colour.\n$ echo $LS_COLORS | grep -Eo '[^:]+=01;34'\ndi=01;34\n\nIn my example, they're directories.\n", "Q: Mount AUFS pooled volume on boot (persistent / permanent) I have mounted aufs with the following command:\nsudo mount -t aufs -o br=/mnt/disk1=rw:/mnt/disk2=rw -o sum -o udba=reval -o create=pmfs none /mnt/virtual\n\nIt seems tow ork as expected so far with files from both disks appearing in virtual directory. The issue is that it gets unmounted on reboot. How do I mount it permanently so it remains after reboot?\nI don't think it can be done in fstab as it's only for physical devices or so it seems. What is the correct way of  achieving this?\n\nA: Putting the line in /etc/rc.local should do the trick.\n", "Q: installing ubuntu in uefi will increase boot speed? i came to know that uefi botting mode gives faster boots. so tell me weather ubuntu supports it ? \nif yes then how to install or enable uefi mode in ubuntu ?\ni have tried enabling uefi mode from bios but error comes : no bootable media :p!!!\n\nA: Enabling UEFI in itself does not increase the boot speed. If it does it is marginal. \nIf you refer to \"fast booting\" on Windows for the quick reboot: this used to be called hibernation. Ubuntu supports hibernation and when using it starting the system is pretty quick in starting. \nIf you want to enable UEFI see our official document. It should answer all the basic questions you might have. \n", "Q: Creating a Path Variable I need to set a path for a variable $week4 to be Week4/assignment so that typing cd $week4 will change the working directory to Week4/assignment/\nI've seen a few examples of similar stuff on here, but I haven't been able to make it work for me.  Help is appreciated!\n\nA: Since your path has spaces in it you need to enclose both the path AND the variable in \"\". Try this from the command line.\nexport week4=\"/home/Justin/Week 4/assignment/\"\n\nNow you should be able to navigate to that directory by typing cd $week4\nIf you want to make this permanent then add the same line to your .bashrc file.\n\nA: To do that you can add following in your ~/.bashrc file .\n  WEEK=/path/of/your/dir/\n\nOpen ~/.bashrc file using gedit ~/.bashrc and add above in it an save it.\nNow you can use cd $WEEK to cd your folder\n", "Q: Prevent SSH from logging out after running initial commands I'm using ssh to connect to a remote Linux machine like this:\nssh -i .ssh/path/to/id_rsa -p 22 user@host 'cd /path/to/dir'\n\nI'd like some commands to be executed upfront (such as cd /path/to/dir) and then proceed with my own business, but I get logged out right away after the commands are run. Any way to stay logged in?\n\nA: Specify your shell afterwards so that runs. You also need the -t flag for a proper shell experience. So you end up with something like:\nssh ... -t user@host 'cd /path/to/dir; /bin/bash'\n\nAs terdon suggests in the comments, if you have a big stack of commands that you want to run every time you connect to this server as this user, you probably want to edit your .profile or .bashrc to run the commands automatically.\n", "Q: Why doesn't POP3 work when IMAP works in Thunderbird?

I first noticed it only when using Spotify so I thought it was a software issue with Spotify, now I've started it noticing sometimes when playing through flash as well so I'm thinking it has more likely to do with pulseaudio. Please help me troubleshoot this. What commands can I run to get you the information you need?\nUpdate:\nI've now started getting the audio muted randomly and I haven't noticed the spikes in a while. There's nothing that I've done, no settings I've changed. But this is even more annoying since I used to be able to max out the volume in Ubuntu and control it with my external speakers instead, but when it get's muted there's nothing I can do to workaround it. Thoughts?\n\nA: I had experienced exactly the same issue on my Debian Stretch some hours ago. If I read this report correctly then it seem that there are bugs with some motherboards and pulseaudio.\nFollow this comment to verify in pulseaudio log that your problem is related with flaky jack sensing.

I have a laptop with a fairly high resolution on a small display (14\"). My external monitor 27\" has a lower resolution than the laptop display. I would like for the text to be similar size on both displays which means I would need to be able to scale the text size differently. You can currently have different scales for the menu and title bars, but I haven't figured out how to do it for text (if even possible). I would need some guidance on this. \n\nA: I switch between a 13\" 1920x1080 built-in display and an external 19\" 1280x1024 one, so I have the same situation. Usually I do it on an app-by-app basis. My main applications are the browser and the terminal.\nThe terminal is easy, just ctrl + and ctrl - until you reach the font size you want. You can define profiles (Edit -> Profiles) and preset font sizes, then switch between profiles (Terminal -> Change Profile) or even define a default profile for newly-launched terminals.\nThe browser is more complicated, for Firefox I go to about:config and set the layout.css.devPixelsPerPx value to 1.4 (found experimentally). For more information see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Firefox.\nI suggest you google for the applications you want to scale and add \"hidpi\" to your search to find application-specific tips.\n", "Q: What does ';;' mean? What does the meaning of ;; in this code from ~/bashrc file?\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nCan I use ;; in other ways? and where?\n\nA: From man bash:\n          If the ;; operator is used, no subsequent matches are\n          attempted after the first pattern match.  Using ;& in  place  of\n          ;;  causes  execution  to continue with the list associated with\n          the next set of patterns.  Using ;;& in place of ;;  causes  the\n          shell  to  test  the next pattern list in the statement, if any,\n          and execute any associated list on a successful match.\n\nSo no, you can't use \";;\" elsewhere, it's case-specific syntax in bash scripts. As for the meaning, if you finish each case item with ;;, it will stop after executing the code for the first match. If you use ;& instead, it will execute the first match, then continue looking for other matches, so you could perform multiple match actions.\nFor additional information see\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/\nand\nhttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/\n\nA: That is the end of a single item in your case-switch,\nsee e.g.:\nbash-case-statement\n\nA: The double semicolon indicates the end of the case branch. See help case command for details.\n", "Q: Windows messed my partitions, is there a way to fix them? I decided to delete a partition called \"HDDRECOVERY\" which I wouldnt use, of around 14 GB, I decided to do it on Windows because I was already working there so I didn't have to boot again into Ubuntu, which is my main system, I only use Windows once a week or so.\nSo I opened the Disk Manager in Windows and simply deleted it. Everything was going fine until then. Then I right clicked my biggest partition where I store all my media files (and have Windows installed) and asked the program to check if I could shrink it and by how much, so I could have another partition to store stuff on.\nThe program froze for like 10 min and then it came back up again, working.\nThen I tried doing some other stuff but didn't because it wouldn't let me.\nThen, I installed like 300 MB of Windows updates bc I don't log on that system very often, and also uninstalled ZoneAlarm and other software that could be slowing my machine, finally restarted the computer and all I see is a grub recovery > command prompt, I tried some stuff there but it couldn't recognize my filesystem.\nThen I inserted the Ubuntu DVD and here I am, trying to figure out what to do.\nimage showing gparted:\n\nThat is what gparted shows,/dev/sda2 is where my biggest partition with all the media and Windows is.\n/dev/sda3 is where my Linux partition should be - note:my home folder is encrypted\nA couple of commands that I tried to determine what to do:\nUbuntu@Ubuntu: ~$ sudo fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/sda: 640.1 GB, 640135028736 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 77825 cylinders, total 1250263728 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x637ca5d8\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048     3074047     1536000   27  Hidden NTFS WinRE\n/dev/sda2         3074048  1167904767   582415360    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3      1167906814  1220651007    26372097    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5      1208262656  1220651007     6194176   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nsudo parted -l\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo parted -l\nModel: ATA TOSHIBA MK6475GS (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 640GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system  Flags\n 1      1049kB  1574MB  1573MB  primary   ntfs         boot, diag\n 2      1574MB  598GB   596GB   primary   ntfs\n 3      598GB   625GB   27.0GB  extended\n 5      619GB   625GB   6343MB  logical\n\n\nWarning: Unable to open /dev/sr0 read-write (Read-only file system).  /dev/sr0\nhas been opened read-only.\nError: Can't have a partition outside the disk!       \n\nSo I really don't know what to do here, it looks like my partition table got completely broken and also grub doesn't work, so I basically cannot boot to neither Windows or Linux, the only positive thing is that I can access my media partition with Windows from the live DVD but I work on my Ubuntu partition and I need access to it at least to restore all the files I had on my download and desktop folders.\nany suggestion is welcome.\n\nA: Looks like you're screwed, especially with an encrypted partition. What you can try is: \n1) Copy everything as it is now, on an external USB, another DD, w/e. Copy byte-by-byte is dd if=/dev/sdX of=foo/bar, that will create an exact replica of /dev/sdX to a file named bar located in /foo (adapt those of course, like dd if=/dev/sda5 of=/media/files/backup_hdd.bkp\n2) Try to recover your partition with a live-session where you'll install testdisk\n3) Play with testdisk and try to restore your DD. \nBonus: you could try to recover some data with ext4undelete (if your partition was in ext4 format?) but I never managed to recover much with that tool.\n\nA: Finally fixed all my hard drive following these simple steps.\nwhile on the ubuntu live CD:\n1) Install TestDisk and run it, very simple.\n2) Install Boot-repair and run it with recommended settings, very simple too.\n", "Q: how to restore bookmarks folder in ubuntu 12.04 LTS from google chrome I accidentally deleted some folders with bookmarks from bookmark manager in google chrome. running in Ubuntu 12.04. Can someone else tell me how restore them?\n\nA: If you have a Bookmarks or Bookmarks.bak file that still holds the information you want, but are unable to make chrome add those bookmarks again, I found this really helpful online tool to convert those json files to an HTML file that you can then just import via the top-right corner in the chrome://bookmarks/ screen:\nhttps://rongjiecomputer.github.io/chrome/bookmark-recovery/#linux\n\nA: You can only restore what you have backed up. Did you create a backup in any way? Chrome stores its configuration in ~/.config/google-chrome if you restore this folder your bookmarks should be back.\nIf you are lucky you find the file ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks.bak still containing your folder. Move this file to a safe location, stop your browser, move it back to ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks start your browser and keep your fingers crossed. \nIf you do not have a backup, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n\nA: I just had to do this, after deleting my bookmarks off a public-y computer after logging out (but not 'logged out' enough). Later I started my main computer and POOF the bookmarks vanished.\nA) Create at least one more copy of your good bookmarks on a good computer (use Bookmarks.bak even). Don't restoring it yet - if you deleted them from ANOTHER computer, they'll just get trashed again.\nB) Open Chrome, go to Settings > People > Sync > disable 'Synch Bookmarks' (maybe disable 'synch all' first)\nC) Disable internet access (unplug cable, disable WiFi, whatever)\nD) Copy your good bookmarks copy to ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks\nE) Start Chrome\nF) go to https://www.google.com/bookmarks/ [how did I manage this with networking off? either it worked, or I've missed a step]\nG) 'Export Bookmarks' (LHS panel) somewhere\nH) Close Chrome\nI) Re-enable networking, re-start Chrome, Re-enable Bookmark synch, Watch your bookmarks disappear again\nJ) Bookmarks > Import bookmarks and settings > (change from Mozilla Firefox to Bookmarks HTML file) > Choose file > point to file yhou saved earlier\nK) Enjoy your old bookmarks!\n", "Q: When will PHP 5.6 be in the official Canonical repos? I imagine it won't up until 14.10 is released, but even if that is the case, could we expect to see it show up in the repos that 14.04 uses? \n\nA: Updated: I Just got an email back from Marc Deslauriers (security engineer at Canonical, so somebody who would know) and the answer is: Probably never. Unless something goes catastrophically wrong with 5.5, it'll have security patches backported for the lifespan of 14.04.\n\nYes, like most packages in Ubuntu, the security team backports security fixes,\n  including for versions that are no longer supported by upstream.\n\nAs of 15.04, the php5* packages are version 5.6. However I would not recommend using a non-LTS release on a production server as they require release upgrades every 9 months (opposed to the 5 years an LTS gets you).\nAnd the only Canonical-supported version in 16.04 seems to be PHP7.\n\nAround June 2016, maybe earlier, maybe never. There are a few different forces at play here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu doesn't do major upgrades on packages unless it's required or globally desirable.\n\n*PHP 5.6 is not fully backwards compatible with PHP 5.5 code, making a mid-term upgrade undesirable; potentially devastating for production servers.\n\n*But PHP 5.5 will only be supported to June 2016.\n\n\nSo unless somebody jumps in an plans on manually maintaining 5.5 (stranger things have happened) there probably will be a transition at some point. It's impossible to say when that'll be this far out though.\nIf you're deploying on 5.5, I'd get testing on 5.6 well in advance, just to make sure you're not caught out. Another option is to use a branch of PHP (like Zend Server) that has commercial support seemingly spanning into the next millennium.\n\nA: If you really want PHP 5.6 on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 or 14.10, you can use this PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install php5\n\nThe default php5 package dependency will pull libapache2-mod-php5 that in turn depends on Apache.  If you want to use different PHP SAPI, make sure you explicitly list it when installing, f.e. for PHP FPM use:\nsudo apt-get install php5 php5-fpm\n\n\nAnnotation: Since December 2015 if you have Apache installed, there is also a dependency on Ondrej's Apache2 PPA:\nppa:ondrej/apache2\n\n\nAs an option I would strongly recommend to use ppa:ondrej/php that includes co-installable PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 versions:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\nsudo apt-get update\n# pull a default PHP FPM (currently PHP 7.0)\nsudo apt-get install php php-fpm\n# pull PHP 7.0 Apache2 mod_php7 explicitly\nsudo apt-get install php7.0 libapache2-mod-php7.0\n# pull PHP 5.6 - just CGI SAPI\nsudo apt-get install php5.6-cgi\n\n\nA: No, 14.10 doesn't have PHP 5.6 (and even if it did, it probably wouldn't gt into the 14.04 repos).\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/php5\n\nA: Ubuntu 15.04 has PHP 5.6 in it. So if you don't care for LTS, upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04. \nSo to answer the question: yes. it is now included in the repositories, but only starting with Ubuntu 15.04.\n", "Q: Multiple users, single laptop, private and shared files I am setting up a Linux laptop for multiple users, Emily and myself, with the following requirements and constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*Emily and I each have our own files that we need to keep private from one another (so I have files that Emily shouldn't be able to access, and she has files that I shouldn't be able to access), and there are also shared files that we both should be able to access.\n\n*We need to bring our laptop with us to far flung places that have no internet connection, so NAS is out of the question, no matter if we can configure it to be accessed remotely.\n\n*We are limited to using the single physical hard drive in this laptop, but we can create as many partitions as necessary to meet our needs.\n\n*We do not need to be able to multiboot multiple Linux OS's, we just need one OS.\n\n*We do not need to both use the laptop at the same time, it's just a plain-Jane, single boot machine with two different users.\n\n\nI know I want to keep swap, OS, and data storage on separate partitions; however, in thinking specifically about how to organize our data storage, I've been debating between the following two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Combine all of our data files onto one partition, create three top-level folders (one for me, one for Emily, and one for Shared), and manage user permissions at the folder level under that single partition.\n\n*Create separate partitions - one for my files, one for Emily's files, and one for Shared files - and manage user permissions under each partition.\n\n\nI was wondering what would be the pros and cons of each option that I describe above? I've searched and found a few other questions that discuss multiple users on a single machine, but none that specifically address my question. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: To my opinion, the best option would be to create at least two different partitions for each home folder. In that folder you can keep the private files without them being accessed by other users. Then you can either make a third partition for shared files, or give permissions to a specific folder in the main system partition so that you can both access it. \nThe problem with it is that you have a fixed amount of storage for your files in each user(that may be a desired behavior)\n\nA: I don't understand the advantage of using separate partitions for access control; it doesn't matter what partition the data is on, what matters is the permissions.\nLinux was designed for this type of access, as was unix.  Both are designed as multi-user systems.  However, there is a problem with root access allows anyone with root access to bypass security.  In fact, anyone with linux knowledge could bypass security by using single-user mode.\nSo, the only real privacy would be to use encryption.  You can encrypt your entire home directory, and put shared files in a separate directory.  Or, you could create a separate directory and encrypt that, putting private files there.  Depending on how many private files you have, you could also simply use a USB drive that you remove when not using it.\n", "Q: Bash: Is there an analogous command to `which` for shell functions? I'm working with Virtualenv, which I found out (after a few google searches) that it creates a shell function called deactivate in my shell.\nBy looking through the package's files I found how it does that, but I was curious if there's a command similar to which which could have told me more about the shell function without me having to grep through files.\nSo the which asdf command tells me the path where the executable asdf is found. which however gives no output for shell functions. Is there a similar command that displays the function's code, or source file, or something of this sort?\nBonus: I'd highly appreciate some command to list the available shell functions.\n\nA: set shows you all available shell functions.\nI don't believe there's a way to figure out where a function was set historically, because I don't think the shell stores this information.\nYou might find set -x helpful to watch execution as it happens.\n", "Q: Fixing permissions of backup files that I don't have -r or -w access to - but still denied access I've always used rsync to backup all my files to an external drive.\nNow after having formatted my hard disk and reinstalled Linux, I wanted to copy the backup files to my hard disk.\nThe problem is that all my backup files on my external drive are somehow set to 'only owner has rw permissions', and I'm not recognized as the owner anymore. I.e. the directories and files are drwx------ and I can't even cd into them, not even as sudo.\nI could at least, using sudo cp, copy directories to my hard drive. But they still have the same permissions. I tried to fix permissions with chmod, and can change them to drwxrw-rw- apparently, but still are denied access to them.\n~/Desktop $ sudo cp -r /media/lb79/EXTHD/LB7979/Google\\ Drive/Pictures/2013 ~/Desktop\n~/Desktop $ ls -gG\ntotal 16\ndrwx------ 5 12288 Sep 23 17:41 2013\ndrwx------ 6  4096 Sep 23 17:37 2014\n~/Desktop $ sudo chmod a+rw 2013\n~/Desktop $ ls -gG\ntotal 16\ndrwxrw-rw- 5 12288 Sep 23 17:41 2013\ndrwx------ 6  4096 Sep 23 17:37 2014\n~/Desktop $ cd 2013\nbash: cd: 2013: Permission denied\n~/Desktop $\n\nSo, how can I change permissions so that I have read and write access again?\nAlso, how to set up rsync parameters so that when I run my next backup, I retain -rw rights to my own files? I always used\nrsync -rltpv\n\nbecause I thought the -p stood for retain permissions, but that worked out differently than expected...\n\nA: Try the following:\nsudo chown -R username:username <directory with your files>\n\nThis will transfer the ownership of these files to you, so you can use them again.\n", "Q: How to access a git repository using SSH?

If you do uname -r, You'll see a version of about 3.13 (mine e.g. is 3.13.0-24). So this driver will not work.\nBut if Ubuntu doesn't even accept the USB, then it's certainly not an issue of the Wifi driver. RTL8191su should run with the preinstalled driver r8712u.\nPlease plug in the device and directly after that execute dmesg | tail. If there's anything USB-related, add it to your question.\n", "Q: script.sh run differently when manually opening terminal and when using .desktop launcher I have a script file script1.sh as shown below:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash \n\ncd /home/userA/scripts\n\n. r1.sh\n\nwhen I manually open a terminal and run it using . script.sh it works fine.\nBut when I created the below .desktop launcher to run it says that ROSRUN command not found.\nThis is the .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry] \nVersion=1.0 \nType=Application \nTerminal=true \nIcon[en_AU]=/home/userA/Pics/pic1.png \nName[en_AU]=automatic \nExec=/home/userA/Desktop/script1.sh \nComment[en_AU]=comment \nName=automatic \nComment=comment \nIcon=/home/userA/Pics/pic1.png\n\nAnd this is how r1.sh looks like:\n#!/bin/bash \nrosrun r1 r1 \\ \n-p1 $p1 \\ \n-p2 $p2 \\ \n-p3 $p3\n\nSo if anyone could please advise what may be the reason behind this happening. As I don't know why it runs smoothy without this error appearing when manually opening a terminal and running it, and why the error appears when I use .desktop launcher instead?\n\nA: As I found out in a chat with the asker, rosrun is a command he defined in his .bashrc.\nAdd the same definition for rosrun to your script1.sh and it should work.\n", "Q: How should I see the skype chat history from the file main.db located at ~/.Skype/SKYPEUSERNAME/?

I tried to install it following these instructions, but Graphicsmagick did not upgrade and remained 1.3.12. I resorted to manually downloading the .deb and installing it using dpkg, but came across this behaviour, where dpkg would install the older version of the package.\n$ gm\nGraphicsMagick 1.3.12 2010-03-08 Q8 http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/\n[...]\n$ sudo apt-get remove graphicsmagick\n[...]\n$ gm\n-bash: /usr/bin/gm: No such file or directory\n$ wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/graphicsmagick/graphicsmagick_1.3.18-1ubuntu3_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i graphicsmagick_1.3.18-1ubuntu3_amd64.deb \nSelecting previously unselected package graphicsmagick.\n(Reading database ... 493625 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking graphicsmagick (from graphicsmagick_1.3.18-1ubuntu3_amd64.deb) ...\nSetting up graphicsmagick (1.3.18-1ubuntu3) ...\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\n$ gm\nGraphicsMagick 1.3.12 2010-03-08 Q8 http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/\n\nThe package does indeed contain the advertised version of graphicsmagick, as installing it on another machine worked fine. Is there some explanation for why a newer version of the package can't be installed? Thanks.\n\nA: Here's how to build version 1.3.20 from source. \nGo to the URL ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick/GraphicsMagick-LATEST.tar.gz and download the file to your Downloads folder and when it asks for a username click cancel or just close the popup.\nThen open a terminal and execute the following commands one-by-one:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install automake build-essential libtool linux-headers-generic\ncd ~/Downloads    \ntar zxvf GraphicsMagick-LATEST.tar.gz\ncd GraphicsMagick-1.3.20\nautoreconf -f -i\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThis will install version 1.3.20! If it does not work in the end, delete the extracted archive (GraphicsMagick-1.3.20 folder) and start over at command #3 on the list of commands above and when you run ./config, read the output and if there are missing dependencies, they should be listed somewhere in there.\nNote: This may fail to run on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 because of outdated versions of automake and autoreconf. To resolve, change AC_PREREQ in configure.ac to 2.68 and change AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = 1.12 to 1.11 in Makefile.am before running autoreconf. The package doesn't need the newer dependencies and compiles just fine.\n", "Q: Is there a faster way to check if a file is in use? I'm looking for a command line function or c function that will let me know if a file is open/in use by something.\nlsof and fuser do tell this, but they provide a lot of other info which results in taking up to 300ms in some situations (like when i use this code on MAC OS X, I'm devving for Linux and OS X) (I have a windows solution that takes 5ms so I'm trying to find something in Unix that also is very quick, and just returns true or false if file is in use)\n\nA: If you are using this as a lock, it will not work as neither lsof or fuser prevent race conditions. \nThe basic process that lsof does is trawl through all processes /proc/*/fs looking for open file descriptors. This is going to take time no matter what you do.\nYou can do this yourself, but it is not likely to be any faster as you have to check for every open process on the system.\nIf what you are doing is time critical, figure out another way to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you control the file through a program that you wrote; use a lock file.\n\n*If you are running some command that operates on the file, look and see what documentation that command/program offers and see if it can't make a lockfile. Failing that, see if it can't make a file with its PID inside it. Then you can look at /proc/<PID>/fs to see if your file is currently open or not. Looking at only one processes open file descriptors will be much faster then mapping across all of them.\n\n*Otherwise in order to help you I am going to need more information about what you are doing.\n\n\n\nYou gave more information in a comment that you want to determine if Firefox is running on a given system. The best way to do this is to look for Firefox's lock files. These are stored in default locations specified on the Mozilla wiki.\nFor example, on linux, have your program do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*open up the ~/.mozilla/firefox/ directory.\n\n*List all directories, filtering for directories ending in .default. (I think all profiles end with .default, if not just crawl into every directory.)\n\n*In each directory above, look for the existence of a file named lock or .parentlock. If you see one or both files, Firefox is open.\n\n\nThis algorithm ought to execute faster than what you do on windows currently.\n\nA: TL;DR\nIn one of your comments, you state:\n\nWell my exact situation is: I have the path to a file. It is locked if firefox is running. I want to see if its locked or not to tell if firefox is running.\n\nYour original question about lockfiles seems like the long way around when there are easier ways to find out whether Firefox is running for a given user, and to inspect its process state.\nExamining Process State\nA more sensible way to find the PID of a given process is to use pgrep from the procps package. For example:\n$ pgrep -u $LOGNAME firefox\n5671\n\nYou can then inspect the state of the PID with ps:\n$ ps 5671\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n 5671 ?        Sl   105:47 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox\n\nor just get the state flags without any other cruft:\n$ ps -ho stat $(pgrep -u $LOGNAME firefox)\nSl\n\nOne my system, the one-liner above consistently takes only 1.4 milliseconds to complete. Your mileage may vary.\nProcess State Codes\nThe PROCESS STATE CODES section of ps(1) details what the various state flags mean. On Ubuntu 14.04 the man page says:\nPROCESS STATE CODES\n       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output\n       specifiers (header \"STAT\" or \"S\") will display to describe the state of\n       a process:\n\n               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)\n               R    running or runnable (on run queue)\n               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)\n               T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is\n                    being traced\n               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)\n               X    dead (should never be seen)\n               Z    defunct (\"zombie\") process, terminated but not reaped by\n                    its parent\n\n       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional\n       characters may be displayed:\n\n               <    high-priority (not nice to other users)\n               N    low-priority (nice to other users)\n               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)\n               s    is a session leader\n               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads\n                    do)\n               +    is in the foreground process group\n\n", "Q: Cannot ping KVM Windows guest from host only I have an Ubuntu 14.04 machine which uses KVM to host a Windows guest.

Or can we jump directly to 14.x?\n\n*Will updating the OS also update the packages? Or do we need to update those separately no matter what?\n\n*I'm nervous about updating packages because I don't want to interrupt some vital services. Any advice on approaching this? Or alleviating my worry?\n\nA: There are two types of upgrades:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal package upgrades\n\n*Release upgrades\n\n\nThe first don't change the version of Ubuntu, only the specific packages involved. \n\n\n*\n\n*Yes. You have to upgrade to 12.04 before upgrading to 14.04.\n\n*The second type of upgrade, release upgrades, changes the version of Ubuntu, and affects every package (almost all of them will get upgraded, some very stable packages get version bumps but remain the same).\n\n\nQ3: Upgrade advice\nDon't do release upgrades (to 12.04 and onwards) now. Stick to 10.04 for a while until you get comfortable with the environment. 10.04 Server will continue to receive security upgrades until April, 2015. So you have until then to make the upgrade to 14.04. However, don't save it until the last minute!\nStudy the changelog carefully before upgrading packages. You can use the Synaptic Package Manager, if you have a GUI, to do so, or aptitude. There will be interruptions if a service is involved (most service packages stop and restart the service concerned). However, major breaking upgrades won't be available (such as between Apache 2.4 and Apache 2.2), so the service should restart up fine in most cases. \nDo not use the backports or proposed repositories. They may introduce packages which may break things. Until you know for sure that absolutely need one, don't enable backports.

The can't identify protocol is probably a connection that hasn't been fully set up yet (see SF question linked above or this SO question).\n\nIs it smarter to make and reuse one connection, or is that not feasible? \n\nYes, and it should be feasible. That is a programming question, though.\n\nWhat exactly is a connection through socket[?]\n\nA socket is typically defined as an endpoint for communication (in man 2 socket and man 3 socket. It depends on which particular protocol you are using.\n\n\nWhat do the columns mean? \n\nAccording to man lsof:\n An  open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special file,\n a character special file, an executing text  reference,  a  library,  a\n stream  or  a  network  file  (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain\n socket.)  A specific file or all the files in  a  file  system  may  be\n selected by path.\n\nThe default list of columns for lsof is:\n$ lsof | head -1\nCOMMAND     PID   TID    USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE  SIZE/OFF       NODE NAME\n\nYou seem to be missing the TID (or thread ID) column. COMMAND, PID and USER are self explanatory. FD is the number of the file descriptor. 399u indicates that the fd is numbered 339 (it can be found at /proc/10573/fd/339) and has both read and write access (u).\nThe TYPE IPv4 indicates that it is an IPv4 socket (sock for a socket of unknown domain).\nThe DEVICE output for normal files:\n\nThe DEVICE column tells us what device we're working on. The two\n  numbers are called major and minor numbers. The list is well known and\n  documented. For instance, major number 8 stands for SCSI block device.\n  For comparison, IDE disks have a major number 3. The minor number\n  indicates one of the 15 available partitions. Thus (8,1) tell us we're\n  working on sda1.\n(0,16), the other interesting device listed refers to unnamed,\n  non-device mounts.\nFor detailed list, please see:\nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/device-list/devices.txt\n\nAnd the list (actually at https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lanana/device-list/devices-2.6.txt) is of not much use for devices with major number 0.\nThe NAME field, for such sockets, is:\n[...]  the  local  and  remote  Internet addresses of a network\nfile; the local host name or IP  number  is  followed  by  a\ncolon  (':'),  the  port,  ``->'',  and  the two-part remote\naddress; IP addresses may be reported as numbers  or  names, [...]\n\n", "Q: Getting 14.04 to run in graphics mode on thinkpad 430s (after upgrade) I have recently upgraded my Thinkpad430s from 12.10 -> 13.10 -> 14.04.\nAfter the upgrade to 13.10 I could not boot in graphics mode and in\norder to start the system I had to edit the grub entry to boot to the\nconsole.

For me it's kind of weird because with other OSes, I used to find it on \"French (Switzerland)\", or \"Swiss-French KEYMAP=fr_CH-latin1\". But at the end, it works, so... no offense taken.\nThe interesting stuff, now, is that Ubuntu seems to have interpret that I'm in Germany, because, even if the full system is displayed in english (as I wanted) and the keyboard layout is fr_CH, the weekday on the right upper corner is displayed in German... \nI went then in System Settings>Language Support, and find out that English is the main language, but German is present as well.

So you simply need to go to System Settings -> Language Support -> Install / Remove Languages and install French (even if you don't intend to use French as display language). Then you should be able to select fr_CH for regional formats.\nAs regards the keyboard layout, I'm pretty sure that French (Switzerland) was available at installation.

Should I go ahead with install and then use gparted to create a swap partition or do it before I install?\n\nA: Swap space is essentially disk space that gets used as RAM when your computer is running low on memory.\nIt's not essential to have swap space, but you could run into problems if you don't have any, and most of your RAM is being used.\nGenerally, unless you don't have a reason not to, you should create swap space. Follow this guide for choosing the amount - as a rule of thumb, create at least as much swap as you have RAM.\nIt doesn't matter if you do it before or after the installation. However, if you plan to do it after the install, be sure to leave enough space to create the swap partition - otherwise, you'll have to shrink your current partition from a live USB/CD.\n", "Q: Trying to install Gametree Linux on Ubuntu 14.04, error when opening I'm trying to install Gametree linux on Ubuntu 14.04 and I've tried using both gdebi and terminal to install it.

By default, Ubuntu 14.04 comes with Python 2.7 that isn't supported by the Gametree installer. So, what can you do? Install Python 2.6 on Ubuntu using pyenv. So, read these instructions:\nInstalling pyenv\npyenv has a automated installer that can bypass a very tricky installation. To use this, just type on your shell:\n$ cd ~\n$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash\n\nThis will download and run the pyenv automated installer. Follow the instructions and, at the end of the process, update the pyenv db:\n$ pyenv update\n\nInstalling Python 2.6 using pyenv\nAfter the pyenv install you will be able to install and run different versions of Python on your system. The version that you will need is Python 2.6, so we will setup this. Using the terminal, type:\n$ pyenv install 2.6.9 && pyenv rehash\n\nThis will install the last 2.6.x version of Python on your system. Now, we need to make this the default version of Python on your machine to make you able to install Gametree.\nSetting up Python 2.6 as system default\nThis is very simple to do using pyenv. Just type at your shell:\n$ pyenv global 2.6.9\n\nNow you should be able to install Gametree without (maybe?) any problems.\nReverting back\nAfter the installation I recommend that you revert the default Python version to your previous sysdefault:\n$ pyenv global system\n\nIf you still have problems, please, provide feedback and I will update my answer.\n", "Q: Problem with formatting memory card I have memory card which I remove during a format on phone and is now not working.\nIn windows it is showing in Device manager as other devices and not showing in disk management.\nI ubuntu 12.04 I tried various solution on internet.

I don't care about the data, I just want the card to work. Someone please help..\n\nA: Before you begin, backup all your files just in case!\nFirst, unplug and plug the card back in. Then, open a terminal and type the following command to list your device names:\ndf\n\nThese next two commands should give you similar results:\nsudo blkid\n\nand\nlsblk\n\nThe device should be listed as /dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdc1. It is important you use the proper device name (/dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdc1) in the following commands or you will format and erase the wrong device!!! Open a terminal and type the following commands (/dev/sdb1 is used here as an example but be aware that your device name may be different!)\nexample command:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\nthen,\nsudo mkfs.vfat -I /dev/sdb1\n\nAlternatively, you could use this command instead:\nsudo mkdosfs -F 32 -v /dev/sdb1\n\nBoth of these commands format the drive to fat32.

This device worked great in 13.10 using VLC to stream the video/audio to a file.  In VLC in 13.10 it showed \"video for linux 2\" as an option for the capture device.  In VLC in 14.04, no \"video for linux 2\" shows an option for the capture device.  It seems to register the device to video1, but trying VLC with video1 but no \"video for linux 2\" results in nothing - the VLC \"cone\" remains on the screen.  I blew away my 14.04 install last night and installed 14.04 instead, and in VLC \"video for linux 2\" shows again and when I select video1 it works fine again.\nThis is a USB device, and I already went through the \"my camera doesn't work in 14.04\" thing.  I know that was because of a new database of devices and a change in udev and mtp(mtd??).  I'm suspecting that the changes to udev is why this device isn't being picked up correctly in 14.04.  In the normal Ubuntu forums nobody replied.  I asked for how to file a bug report, but everything you have to go through to get information together, etc., to actually file a bug report just gets me lost.  I don't even know how to get that information.  Having \"downgraded\" to 12.04 it will be difficult to get the information for 14.04.  It was suggested in the Ubuntu forums that I run 14.04 off a live media and recreate the problem - but again, I don't understand at all what information they need and how the heck I get it.  After feeling lost on launchpad, I clicked on the link there to come here and ask for any form of help.  I can do my best to provide information asked for.\nThanks\n\nA: This thing won't let me comment because I'm just a starter here, so I had to use the \"answer\" option in order to post a reply:\nThat is a BIG step up!!  I'm glad it was, as I wiped 12.04 and did another fresh install of 14.04 64-bit with the hope it could be made to work.\nThere is one thing that's not quite right yet - the audio.  I selected the proper device, and I have some sound, but there is a lot of noise overriding it.  Just so you know the noise wasn't there in my 12.04 testing.  I had to go to advanced options and change the audio there from \"primary language\" to \"stereo\" or I didn't get any of the video audio - just noise.  In the advanced options I had to set the power line frequency from its default to 60hz - now everything is working great!!!!!!\nOut of a strong desire to know, do you know which package, or combination of packages, made this work now?\nThanks SO MUCH!!\nEDIT: 9/25/2014 - well, I do still have a problem.  The answer did at least get the device working, but when I stream to a file via VLC the sound is WAY out of sync in the resulting file.  I've seen options to adjust it via playback in VLC, but I'm scanning in some old VHS tapes to put on a media center, and I obviously can't do any type of run-time adjustments.  I've also seen some other threads that show how to do something with splitting the audio and video and then keep adjusting the sound as time goes on.  I'm not knowledgeable enough to do that nor do I particularly want to be.  Prior to 14.04, this all worked fine.  I have no idea if this 14.04, or if it's a problem with VLC.  Are there any other GUI based programs that are simple enough for someone like me to use that will accept a USB video capture device as input and write the output to a file?\nThanks\n", "Q: PHP not running for FOG web management server I am making an imaging server for my computer engineering course. \nI have installed Ubuntu Server 12.04 32-bit on the dual processor server, then I upgraded using d-release-upgrade to 14.04. \nI then tried to install the fog imaging tools using the provided installfog.sh script. I had already successfully completed the install on a different computer (Ubuntu desktop 14.04 64-bit). After installing onto the desktop you could access the web tools by accessing /fog/management on a web browser. On the desktop the page rendered completely fine. \nThe last step of installing fog asks you to update the mysql database (IIRC) by logging into the website. Whereas the desktop worked fine, the server does not. Yesterday, when trying to access the website, it would instantly ask you to download a file, as if it were a download link. The file was always a random set of letters capital and lowercase with no file extension. When opened the file was a PHP file. When I looked in htop for any PHP process I could not find one. \nThis morning, I sudo apt-get purge 'd php5 and a few other php5 packages that the fog install log said it installed, then I reinstalled them. After starting the FOG installation again, I once again came to the last step. This time instead of prompting for a download, it appeared to display a \"half-rendered\" webpage, with the default FOG blue background and FOG logo, but also with random strings of (what I assume is) PHP code simply strewn around the screen.\nI really need this problem fixed but I have never done web server things before. I have totally stumped my instructor in the process. \n\nA: Using the provided information as a base, you don't have PHP installed to run with Apache (as an Apache module). The common installation is to use PHP as a module of Apache, what can be easily be achieved using apt-get like this:\nsudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n", "Q: Printer prints blank pages I have a new Brother HL-2240 printer usb connected on Ubuntu 14.04.1. using the Brother HL-2170W Foomatic/ljet4 driver (the driver recommended by default).

But, they also have a required fallback to PS/2 mode, which allows them to work with non-i2c-aware OSes.\nIn PTP mode (i2c), the device simply reports three to five individual X/Y coordinates for touch.  No relative mouse data is reported.  Windows 8 (and other driver-supported OSes) use these points to either compute a relative mouse delta (single point) or gestures.\nIn PS/2 mode, obviously, it works like a normal touchpad.\nThe problem here is that Linux is i2c-aware, but does not have the proper driver to get the HID report descriptor and other necessary data to work with the PTP device.  The attempt to work with the i2c device fails, but the device is stuck in i2c mode and won't respond to the Synaptics PS/2 driver.\nI have this same laptop, and am going to attempt to install Linux Mint 17 (after I finish imaging the stock install with G4L)  I will attempt the 'blacklist i2c-hid' solution/workaround described here:\nhttp://trustdarkness.com/wordpress/dell-sputnik-xps-13-touchpad-settings-not-working-in-updated-ubuntumint/\n...and see what happens...\n[UPDATE]\nThe touchpad is working with the blacklist entry (and the touch screen continues to work as well).  This is not an ideal solution, because a PTP touchpad running over an i2c bus is capable of so much more than a simple PS/2 touchpad.  But, I'm hopeful we'll get a proper driver for i2c and be able to use the full capabilities in Linux soon.\n[UPDATE 2]\nDoing more research, I found out that the clickpad is part of Synaptics' RMI4 line of products, and the latest kernels have driver support.  So, I followed this guide to downloading, building and installing the latest Linux kernel:\nhttp://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=131433\nAfter installing, and before rebooting, remove the blacklist entry you created for the clickpad.  Reboot, and... now it works better.\nThe acceleration and speed settings will need to be readjusted, but I've found that tapping and two-finger scrolling works MUCH better in i2c mode than PS/2.\nOn a side note, the newer kernel/driver for the Intel wireless module in this laptop also seems to provide better performance than what I had in place before.\n", "Q: How do you check if a property is undefined in qml?

This will evaluate to false if text is null.\nIf you want check if value is present (i.e., check for both undefined and null), use it as condition in if statement or ternary operator. If you need to store result of comparison as a boolean value, use var textPresent = !!text (though double ! might appear confusing to one reading the code).\n\nA: Try:\ntext: text ? text : \"default text\"\n\"undefined\" is just a string representation of a reference not referencing anything, just like None, or NULL in other languages.\n=== is strict comparison operator, you might want to read this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript\n", "Q: Is it possible to get VM guest ip in Nat network virtualbox I am having virtualbox VM in which Guest addition is install i can get VM ip by below command\nVBoxManage guestproperty get \"vm-name\" \"/VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/0/V4/IP\" \n\nBut, I want to get guest IP in Nat Network without accessing VM, i have created Nat network using below command \n“VBoxManage natnetwork add -t <nat name> -n \"192.168.15.0/24\" -e”\n\nI attached nat network to VM and Now i want to get guest IP without using guestproperty\nI think it is possible because natNetwork i am creating is on physical machine and it works somewhat like DHCP to all VMs. So, virtualbox must be maintaining some information about which ip is assign to which VM for natNetwork.\nThanks \n\nA: I believe you can use nmap like this.

But that doesn't work. So where is the fault?\nAnd are there any other ways to do this?\n\nA: Remapping URL\nIf you want to remap url to a different location, but clients still access and know original url, you should use RewriteRule directive.\nTry to add this lines in VirtualHost section:\n  RewriteEngine on\n  RewriteRule ^/abc/a\\.zip$ /abc/b.ziP [PT] \n\nHere is RewriteRule syntax:\n  RewriteRule Pattern Substitution [flags]\n\nwhere, according to apache mod_rewrite manual:\n  Pattern: In VirtualHost context, The Pattern will initially be matched \n       against the part of the URL after the hostname and port, and \n       before the query string (e.g. \"/app1/index.html\").\n  Substitution: A DocumentRoot-relative path to the resource to be served. \n       Note that mod_rewrite tries to guess whether you have specified a\n       file-system path or a URL-path by checking to see if the first \n       segment of the path exists at the root of the file-system. \n       For example, if you specify a Substitution string of \n       /www/file.html, then this will be treated as a URL-path unless \n       a directory named www exists at the root or your file-system \n       (or, in the case of using rewrites in a .htaccess file, relative \n       to your document root), in which case it will be treated as a \n       file-system path. \n       If you wish other URL-mapping directives (such as Alias) to be \n       applied to the resulting URL-path, use the [PT] flag as described below.\n  flag: special action\n\nIn this case flag value is PT tha means:\n  passthrough|PT    Forces the resulting URI to be passed back to the URL \n      mapping engine for processing of other URI-to-filename translators, \n      such as Alias or Redirect. details ...\n\nHere is useful link with examples.\nThere is Alias directive that remap content location too. This one is useful if content location is outside of DocumentRoot.\nRedirect request\nIf you want to inform the client that the requested content is located at a different URL, and instruct the client to make a new request with the new URL, you should use Redirect directive.\ntry adding this line in VirtualHost section:\n  Redirect permanent /abc/a.zip http://example.com/abc/b.ziP \n\nThis is useful to inform robot that contents are moved in other location, and prevent errors of indexing in search engines.\n\nA: For simple redirects, the RewriteEngine is overkill.

I want to uninstall Ubuntu, so I need to delete its partition.\nI saw that many people asked this before. For example: How to find out which partition is Ubuntu installed on?. I followed the instructions there and here's a screenshot of the terminal after typing the suggested command (df):\n\nBut this doesn't tell me anything... \nThis has also been discussed before Uninstalling Ubuntu. Which partitions to delete? and the answer was: EFI and primary. But I have a lot of primary partitions and I'm not sure which one to delete.\nHere's a screenshot of Disk Management in Windows:\n\nHere's a GParted screenshot:\n\nSo can anybody tell me which the Ubuntu partitions are? (I numbered them from left to right, so to make it easy just tell me numbers please)\n\nA: From the  output of df command what I can see is the size of your Ubuntu partition is 47930248 KB which is equal to 46 GB approximately. \nFrom this you can conclude  that it is your 5th partition(partition which you have marked 5) on which Ubuntu is installed.\nBut I will suggest you to use gparted by running Ubuntu in live mode.\n\nA: Do not remove /dev/sda1 (The 1st partition) The EFI partition is part of UEFI and is used by both Windows and Ubuntu. If you delete it, the computer won't boot.\nComparing the Gparted and Disk Management screenshots, you want to delete 5th, 6th, and 7th partition as displayed in Windows Disk Management. Or /dev/sda9, /dev/sda10, /dev/sda11 as displayed in gparted. \nYou will still have to remove GRUB after removing those partitions. \nSee How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? for how to easily remove Ubuntu.\nFinally, remove the Ubuntu boot entry (or entries) in the UEFI boot manager in the image below:\n\nSee How do I remove \"Ubuntu\" in the bios boot menu? (UEFI)\nYou will need to boot from Ubuntu Live DVD/USB to temporarily install efibootmgr. \nIn the Live boot, (Use Try Ubuntu without installing) Open a terminal by pressing Cntrl+Alt+T: and enter the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo efibootmgr\n\nThis will show you which entries in the UEFI boot manager refers to the old Ubuntu install.\nTo remove entry number X enter:\nsudo efibootmgr -b X -B \n\nReplace X with the correct number.\nRepeat the last two commands if there are more than one entries.\nNote: I have removed the part about OS Uninstaller, as some people seems to have problem with it.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Windows and Linux name partitions very differently.\nTo identify your partitions from Linux either use gparted (graphical tool) or fdisk (command line)\nfdisk -l\n\nFrom what you posted, your root partition for Ubuntu is /dev/sda9\nsda = first  hard drive\nsda9 = 9th partition\nHard to know what is on your other partitions from what you posted.\nI suggest you identify your partitions in Linux as Windows does not identify the contents of your partitons as windows can not read linux partition.\nIf you wish to do this in windows , ask on a windows forums.\nSee also https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/partitioning\n\nA: According to your GParted screenshot and what you have told us, you can see that the Ubuntu installation root is installed on /dev/sda9. You can tell this by looking in the \"mount point\" column and seeing the \"/\", which is the root.\nYou can also tell that your /home is on /dev/sda10 by looking in the same column.\nBoth of which are the only ext4 (not that you cannot install using NTFS), but they are the only ones to match up with your mount points.\nAlso, the rest of the partitions are either NTFS (which is what Windows uses) and are matched with Microsoft flags, therefore you know they are not the Ubuntu install, or they are unknown.\nThe answer is your Ubuntu installation is using /dev/sda9 for the root, /dev/sda10 for home, and /dev/sda11 is used for swap.\n", "Q: Laptop is bootting directly into Windows 8 I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit  along side Windows 8.1 on my  HP 15-n203tx laptop.I created a bootable USB.\nWhen I tried using legacy boot it didn't detect my Windows.

The method of having one application use memory and cpu from each node in the cluster requires the application be written using things like MPI, PVM and MPICH. Blender does not make use of these so would require a rather in depth code alteration to take advantage of this setup.\nHowever blender does have a built in network render available. Basically you setup one machine as a master that tracks the rendering tasks, and several computers as slaves to do the work. Then you have a client on your desktop that sends the rendering task to the master and gets the result back. BlenderCookie has a tutorial covering the basics. While the video is citizen only the main info is detailed on the page. The main drawback of network render is lack of support for calculating simulations using this setup. The other consideration is it is intended for animations, each node renders one complete frame.\nYou can also setup your own render farm. Using CLI options or python scripting you can have each computer render images. With a little effort you can create script that positions cameras to break a final image into separate renders that can then be stitched together.\n\nA: If you are using a pure Beowulf Cluster, then MPI,PVM, and/or MPICH are required which Blender does not support.\nHowever, if you use a MOSIX Cluster you can achieve the SuperComputer performance you need without having to rewrite your programs.  MOSIX is a linux kernel patch that does the same things as the Beowulf software does, but is far simpler to implement and use.\n", "Q: Script Not Running Properly On Server I am having an issue with my webserver.  I am testing it out on a new kernel build and it seems as if I can't get one certain part running on it.  All of my scripts work except this one.  Every file for the time being has 777 permissions(I know it is wrong to do this).\nThe script that I am having issues is one that opens the /etc/network/interfaces file and saves it to a string for editing.  Once the edits are done it saves string to a tempinterfaces file which then that file gets cp over to the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nI know this script works on my old server so it is not a script issue.  I had to manually install apache2.2.29 on my new Kernel.  This script does not even write to the tempinterfaces file as it is never updated.  The cp command is not executed either during this script execution.\nAny suggestions on solving this problem?\nEdit*  The script is being executed as in for the fact that there is no 500, 404, 200 error during attempted execution of the script.  I have a feeling it has something to do with permissions but I can't seem to focus in on the issue.  I am also new to working with permissions.\nipChange Script: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8417964/\n\nA: I ended up downloading apache2 from archives.  Did not know you could do that.  I felt like I was missing some file but could be wrong.  I also needed to change the permissions on /etc/network/interfaces to 666 and was able to get it working.\n", "Q: How to restore proper notification handling with gnome-session, Openbox, Cairo-dock? I run Ubuntu 14.04 with gdm and gnome-session, but I disabled dash/metacity/unity and use Openbox and Cairo Dock. Last week, all was fine - notifications appeared in a transient dock popup. After doing software updates this week, this no longer works. If I do\nzenity  --notification --title \"alert\" --text \"notice me\"\n\ninstead of the normal out-of-the-way notification, I get a dialog box that steals focus\nand which is persistent (must be dismissed):\n\nwhich is disruptive (and which will get dismissed accidentally if I'm in the middle of typing something and press the spacebar before I noticed the popup).\nI have 'Notification Area' on in Cairo Dock, and also enabled 'Notification Area Old' but nothing works.\nHow do I restore correct notification handling?\n\nA: Zenity \"notifications\" don't use the standard notification system (libnotify). What you see is standard behaviour. If you want to send notifications you have to use notify-send (available in  the libnotify-bin package).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14 / Win 8.1 Install Problem I'm trying to return to Ubuntu on a new(er) computer after I had to switch to Mint on my old machine due to performance issues. The new machine is an HP pavillion G4 w/ 4gp memory and a 500GB HD. I can successfully run from live usb, although it cannot mount any of the windows drives.\nI read :\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nwhere the author describes how to install Ubuntu when it doesn't recognize the Windows 8 partitions. I've done all the pre-requisites, and still Ubuntu installer doesn't recognize the windows partitions. So now I'm down to the \"Something else\" method, and I'm confused with the language in this part:\n\n\"You need to create at least 1 partition for the root system (Which shows as the symbol \"/\") and set it to Ext4, another for SWAP (Virtual Memory). The SWAP space can be as small as 128MB if you have a lot of ram or as high as 4GB. With this 2 partitions created based on the empty space you provided you should be ready to proceed. And one last one for the EFI part which should be around 100MB.\"\n\nI get that I have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*root, mounted at /, ext4, (of approx size 50GB)\n\n*swap, mounted at \"swap\", (of size approx 6GB or 1.5 x physical memory)\n\n*Home (optional)\nMy question is what is meant by the \"And one last one for the EFI part...?\" Does this mean another partition? if so, mount point etc.\n\nA: EFI partition is usually the firs one, so you can create setup like this /dev/sda1 (~200MB) of filesystem FAT32 and mount point /boot/efi \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition\n\nA: if you use uefi bios , you need an efi partition , and your win8 have already created one , and this efi partition doesn't need to monut , when you install , you just choose this partition to install efi loader file in it , it does the same thing when you install mbr in one partition for legacy bios\n", "Q: DNS issues with my ubuntu 14.04 I just switched to Ubuntu 14.0.4 from Windows 7 using dual boot mode. I am connecting to my office's network using wireless wlan0. I am experiencing issues when trying to ssh to access several Linux host. The hostname is not resolving to an IP. I checked /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/network/interfaces. There's no static DNS defined. I am obtaining an IP via DHCP. I have did not experience issue with Windows 7 basically.  \nTo workaround I have to manually insert DNS and search domain in the /etc/network/interfaces file. Thereafter I am able to ssh to Linux as the hostname now translates an IP. Confirmed with nslookup.\nHowever the problem comes when I get home on home's network. I noticed upon booting up my laptop into Ubuntu, firefox takes a while to translate a URL and noticeably slow. However once the website loads up it speed up. I did some website benchmark no issues with speed. I am highly suspecting due to DNS settings. When I comment off the DNS servers (which is my office's one), things are back to normal. My ISP indicated that no DNS is required to specify as we are assigned IPs through DHCP.\nFor the time being, I am doing manual comment/uncomment DNS entries to flick the switch :P Not sure if there's a better way to solve this.\nCheers.\n\nA: Thank you for your help. I managed to solve my problem. My bad. Slapped my wrist. \nnmcli dev list iface eth0 returns correct DNS information. My office's DNS is giving correct DNS and IP. What happened was the DNS server returned domain A (local office). However I was trying to connect to another site (domain B). Hence nslookup and ssh without the domain B supplied will return error.\nEg:\nssh hostname (Does not work)\nssh hostname.domainB.com (works) \n\nThis is because even though I am connected successfully to the network. I am with domain A. I figured out that I need to append my dns suffix in /etc/resolvconf/tail to overcome this otherwise I need to specify domainB each time.\nTo add one more important observation. It took me a while to troubleshoot as nslookup and /etc/resolv.conf always points to 127.0.1.1. It confuses me as to why it goes to local DNS than my DNS server. I found it is the way Ubuntu Desktop uses resolvconf and local DNS and it is specified in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (entry dns=dnsmasq).\n\nA: \nMy ISP indicated that no DNS is required to specify as we are assigned IPs through DHCP\n\nMost probably your ISP wanted to say that you are, together with your IP (and possibly a default gateway), assigned a DNS through DHCP.\nCheck this using the command nmcli dev list iface eth0 | grep IP4 in a terminal, you then see if your system gets its DNS via DHCP.\nYou could also check the leases file manually using less /var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.leases and look for \"dns\". Note that at some time, the path and filename changed to /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient-ethX.leases.\nIf the DHCP server does not assign a DNS, check with your ISP and the sysadmins in your office.\n", "Q: The server cant resolve host names Please help with the following problem.\nServer is running under Ubuntu 14.04 server 32x.\nIP tables:\nINPUT DROP [0:0]  :FORWARD DROP [0:0]  :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0] \n\n-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT\n\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \n\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT \n\n\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 548 -j ACCEPT \n\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 10000 -j ACCEPT \n\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --sport 1024:65535 --dport 53 -j ACCEPT \n\n-A INPUT -i eth1 -j ACCEPT \n\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT \n\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -m state --state RELATED -j ACCEPT \n\n-A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT \n\n-A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED -j ACCEPT \n\n-A FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 548 -j ACCEPT\n\nWhen I try to ping hosts by their name from the server console, I get \"unknown hosts\".\nPing using IP address work.\nWhat may I change in my iptables?\n\nA: The problem has been solved by adding those strings:\n-A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 1024:65535 --sport 53 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1024:65535 --sport 53 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n\n", "Q: echo \"${txtred}Text${txtrst}\" color not always working I have a .sh file through terminal and I'm using echo \"${txtred}Text${txtrst}\" as a display of what's happening when running the script.

Where can I locate the program now?\n\nA: To locate it it, use the following command :\ndpkg -L package_name\n\nAlternatively, you can search it in Unity by pressing the launcher and typing the name of the application or package you installed.\nTo run it as a normal user, open the terminal and type in the application name, that is, the command of the application. As an example, to run rhythmbox music player, you just opn the terminal and type in rhythmbox, and it will open. \nTo uninstall an application, you need aministrative priviledges, hence the need to use sudo in a command line.

You can then delete or make invisible all the frames/layers except for the one you want, and export the image in any format supported by gimp.\n\nA: You can break the gif into images, and browse them with the speed you want:\nconvert input.gif output%05d.png\n\n\nA: The simplest way to do it is play your gif animation in mplayer \nOpen your gif file in mplayer using following command\n  mplayer -loop 0  -speed 0.2 your_gif\n\nHere \n-loop 0 means it will run your gif image untill you are not closing it and\n-speed 0.2 means it will decrease the animation speed to 20%.\nYou can pause your animation by pressing the Space button .\nmplayer will also show the frame information of your running gif in terminal. \n\n\nA: mpv is very good at viewing gif files. It shows the similar slider as shown while palying videos and can easily move forward/backward and can stop at any frame.\n\nA: Although mplayer is indeed a simple way just to pause GIF animation and perhaps make a screenshot of a particular frame, it seems thas mplayer does not allow to navigate between frames. A tool gifview (provided by gifsicle package in Ubuntu) does a great job to provide fine-grain control over gif viewing. See the (very short) manpage for gifview for corresponding shortcuts.\nMake sure you disable the optimized mode with u. Otherwise, only diffs between frames will be shown and one can have an impression that the tool does not work properly.\n", "Q: Can not install Mobile Media Convert on Ubuntu 14.04 After installling 14.04, I have tried several .deb versions of Mobile Media Converter  but all have unmet dependencies. like this:\n$ sudo dpkg -i mmc_1.7.4_amd64.deb \nSelecting previously unselected package mobilemediaconverter.\n(Reading database ... 213506 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack mmc_1.7.4_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking mobilemediaconverter (1.7.4) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mobilemediaconverter:\n mobilemediaconverter depends on ia32-libs; however:\n  Package ia32-libs is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libfaac0; however:\n  Package libfaac0:amd64 is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libavcodec-extra-53; however:\n  Package libavcodec-extra-53 is not installed.\n\nor this:\n$ sudo dpkg -i mmc_1.8.5_mutliarch.deb\n(Reading database ... 213550 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack mmc_1.8.5_mutliarch.deb ...\nUnpacking mobilemediaconverter (1.8.5) over (1.7.4) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mobilemediaconverter:\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.2.0); however:\n  Package libglib2.0-0:i386 is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.2.0); however:\n  Package libgtk2.0-0:i386 is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libvorbis0a; however:\n  Package libvorbis0a:i386 is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libmp3lame0; however:\n  Package libmp3lame0:i386 is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libfaac0:amd64; however:\n  Package libfaac0:amd64 is not installed.\n mobilemediaconverter depends on libavcodec-extra-53; \n\nAnyone have succeeded to install that,  I have also installed ffmpeg using this repo.\n$ ffmpeg -version\nffmpeg version 2.4 Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers\nbuilt on Sep 15 2014 01:02:34 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)\nconfiguration: --extra-libs=-ldl --prefix=/opt/ffmpeg --enable-avresample --disable-debug --enable-nonfree --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-x11grab --enable-libpulse --enable-libopencore-amrnb --enable-libopencore-amrwb --disable-decoder=amrnb --disable-decoder=amrwb --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-libfdk-aac --enable-libvorbis --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopus --enable-libvpx --enable-libspeex --enable-libass --enable-avisynth --enable-libsoxr\n\nI appreciate to tell me how to install this brilliant video converter. \n\nA: The .deb packages requires libavcodec-extra-53, but ubuntu 14.04 has libavcodec-extra-54.\nYou can download the \"mmc-lin-185.zip\" package, extract and run the executable from result folder to start the app.\n", "Q: How do locate and use programs that are available on the computer by default?

Is this related and what can I do in this case?\n\nA: Do these files represent a security problem? Yes.\nWill deleting them fix the problem? No.\nYou've been hacked. Judging from the location of these files, somebody found an exploit in a web script you were running, and they've managed to download these applications. These have allowed them to go on and install more junk which is sending out spam. Hence the blacklisting.\nThere is no easy recovery from this.

I did read that Ubuntu has been certified on the 1950 but dont seem to understand what is causing the issue.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: You need to go into the BIOS and change a setting on the usb boot option, so that the bios emulates it as a harddrive, it will then show up as C: to the installer.

I’m running Ubuntu Quantal (version 12.10), which no longer receives security updates from Canonical. What’s the quickest way to update my copy of bash against the big vulnerability reported today?\n\nA: The cleanest way is to compile from source.\nThe correct way is to upgrade.\nThe wrong way is to get the package from a release which has patched that (according to this question, fixes have been released for supported versions - 10.04, 12.04, 14.04) and install it.\n\nA: It is possible to download the Precise (12.04) Bash package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/bash and install it on Quantal (12.10).\nI have been running this on a server all day and haven't noticed any problems. I plan to upgrade the server, but for a number of reasons I can't do it for a couple of weeks. This is only a stopgap solution.\nTo do this you need to follow the link above, choose which architecture your system is running (amd64 or i386) and download the relevant package. It can then be installed using dpkg, with something like:\nsudo dpkg -i  /path/to/download/bash_4.2-2ubuntu2.3_amd64.deb\n\n", "Q: Command to identify running computer Based on development level there are three computers on which I work at.\nMy personal computer has a different version, and the other two are a development and production servers with similar characteristics but different passwords.  \nI use some of my code in the three computers, but sometimes I have to adjust settings depending on which computer I'm running the program from.  Is there an environmental variable that will allow me to identify which computer I'm working on, so that I can do this automatically?  \nThe servers are Ubuntu 12.04 and my computer is Kubuntu 14.04. \nThank you.\n\nA: Using $HOSTNAME, for example:\n$ echo $HOSTNAME \nCastle2012\n\nmay help, as may $SESSION, for example:\n$ echo $SESSION\nubuntu\n\nand $_system_version, for example:\n$ echo $_system_version \n14.04\n\n\nA: Probably and a very simple way to differentiating a system from the next one would be the mac address of the first interface.\nEach network device present on a system will have a unique mac address, reading the mac address for a device will probably tell you what system you are working on.\nFor example:\n$ /sbin/ifconfig p4p1 | grep ether | awk '{print $2}'\nb8:ca:3a:c7:e2:e6\n\nUsing the mac address I can be sure that this is the system I am working on because the mac address of that interface will not match (unless changed on purpose) another system's interfaces mac address.\n", "Q: Why did my highlights turn pink/purple in Xubuntu 14.10? Around the time of the start to testing of the second beta for Xubuntu 14.10, my highlights turned pink system-wide.  What gives?\n\n\n\nA: As confirmed in remarks by Xubuntu Project Leader Simon Steinbeiß in Launchpad Bug 1373280, the changes can be adjusted through the use of the gtk-theme-config utility included in Xubuntu.  This was confirmed as not a bug but a deliberate design decision.\nA deliberate design decision was made to emphasize the \"unicorn\" aspect to the 14.10 release by updating the default theme in various ways such as making the pink highlight occur even for those upgrading from 14.04 as well as for those making new installations.  In the drafted release notes for Xubuntu 14.10 Beta 2, the release team stated:\n\nTo celebrate the 14.10 codename \"Utopic Unicorn\" and to demonstrate the easy customisability of Xubuntu, highlight colors have been turned pink for this release. You can easily revert this change by using the theme configuration application (gtk-theme-config) under the Settings Manager; simply turn Custom Highlight Colors \"Off\" and click \"Apply\". Of course, if you wish, you can change the highlight color to something you like better than the default blue!\n\n", "Q: How I set any distribution for Debian package?

What I should to do?\n\nA: That is an issue for the repository that distributes your package, not your package itself. If you want to go with a generic name, pick stable.\n\nA: The debian/changelog file format supports multiple distributions, separated by space:\npackage-name (1.0-1) trusty bionic eoan focal; urgency=low\n\nfor example.\nIf you build with debuild, lintian will issue the following error:\nE: libsdrplay-api changes: multiple-distributions-in-changes-file trusty bionic eoan focal\n\nbut still builds a valid package. The reason is the debian repository doesn't accept multiple distributions for a package: https://lintian.debian.org/tags/multiple-distributions-in-changes-file.html\nI don't know if Launchpad accepts it.\nUsually it is better to generate a package per distribution but in some cases it can make sense to target several if there is really no distribution specificity and the targeted repository supports it.\n", "Q: How to get updates for Ubuntu 12.04 I recently stopped being able to get updates for Ubuntu 12.04.

Then re-run sudo apt-get update.\nIf you're having this problem, though, then there may also be other issues in your APT sources.  You should only have lines referring to \"precise\" (Ubuntu 12.04) and not \"trusty\" (Ubuntu 14.04).\nNote that the warning you received about duplicate sources.list entries seems to be unrelated to your problem, and not a serious problem (other than generating this warning), but could be a further indication that you - or something - has messed up your sources.list file(s).\n", "Q: thunderbird mail contacts backup Do you know how I can back up my address book in Thunderbird mail.

You can follow the Basic Approach - no need to follow the Developers Approach.  I know it looks daunting, but take it a step at a time and it will work for you.\nYou can list modules loaded from the command line with the command lsmod.  You should see dvb_core, v42_common, and other modules that reference \"cx18\" when things load correctly.

The custom shell variant didn't allow SFTP, and this doesn't either, but I'd like to somehow get SFTP to work for all these servers. \n\nA: The trick to getting SFTP working is to pass on the SSH command received from the client as-is to the server.

I need some recommendations on a good todo list type of app that works on Windows and Ubuntu. I would like to keep track of my assignment's due dates across both OS.\n\nA: Thank you everyone for the suggestions. I ended up using a free open source app that is available on Ubuntu and Windows called Tasque. It can be found here: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tasque\nThe app can store the list locally or via Remember the Milk's API (which is what I decided to use). It's simple and exactly what I was looking for. It says open in the taskbar area of Windows and Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you are using Google Chrome, I suggest you use an app with a Chrome extension support with it such as Any.do, which has a mobile app as well. I use this for daily use with my Ubuntu laptop, work desktop and my phone.\n\nA: Todoist - https://en.todoist.com/\nMore than basic functionality in the free version, runs on browsers or app for smartphones, Windows; integrates with Gmail, Thunderbird, Outlook, Firefox, Chrome ... \nHas a handy Karma feature to show you how good you are with keeping to your lists.\nHas priorities, groups / projects, tags, calendaring, etc ...\n\nA: Another choice would be Wunderlist which comes with a dedicated Chrome app that works on all platforms supported by Chrome.\n\nA: The ToDo List Manager I recommend is 'Task Coach'. It is available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, BSD, iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. You can load different 'ToDo' List Database files which may be cloud synchronised from you various OS's and there is even a Portable App version incase you need to update your activities from a locked down Windows PC. \nIncidentally, Portable Apps is available for various platforms ... but that is another story.\n", "Q: Error messages flash up briefly during boot and shutdown - are these logged anywhere?

It just goes straight to the other operating system, windows vista.\nI don't have admin access is that occurring the problem? My computer is really old. It is the 32 bit.\nHow to solve this problem?\n\nA: Enter your BIOS setup utility and change the boot sequence so that the CD is the first entry in the list of boot devices. The Ubuntu minimal CD being very small (<40MB) and text only should be able to boot successfully, even on older systems where the graphical Ubuntu live DVD/USB does not boot successfully. There is no need to use a different Xubuntu CD, because you can select and install the Xubuntu desktop from the Software selection menu inside the Ubuntu minimal CD installer. \nYou should be able to enter the BIOS setup utility without administrative rights, unless it is password protected by an unknown password, and even so you can remove the BIOS password by removing the CMOS battery from the motherboard for 5 minutes and then putting it back in. This will also reset all BIOS/UEFI settings back to their defaults. \n\nCMOS battery\n", "Q: GRUB freezes if external hard drive is connected. Can I simply make it invisible to GRUB? GRUB seems to freeze whenever my 2 TB external hard drive (WD My Book) is connected. Connecting it while GRUB is loading does the same thing, but doing it afterwards or not at all will let my computer boot normally. My guess is that GRUB thinks the device is carrying a boot loader and/or an operating system, and then hangs when trying to identify it. I should also mention that this wasn't an issue before, and it came to me as a surprise when I suddenly wasn't able to turn on my computer.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling GRUB\n\n*Disabling USB support in my motherboard settings (worked, but I wasn't able to use my keyboard to navigate GRUB)\n\n*Connecting the drive to a different USB port\n\n*Google\n\n\nCan I make GRUB completely ignore the drive? Any other ideas on what I could try?\n\nA: GrUB will write code and data to some devices which will utterly confuse some BIOS USB code.  The only thing I found which will make some of my systems not freeze is to format the first partition (e.g., /dev/sdb1) as VFAT (intending it to be used for GrUB boot.  And that doesn't work for all of them, but it seems to help with some.  I mean, if you don't do that, not even the power button will get you out of this, you have to hold the power button in or yank the power cord, it's that far \"gone.\"\nSorry noone has answered until now, but as I think you've found, unless you want to reformat your (USB) storage (and all the things you lose with FAT compared to ext3 or others) you'll have to disconnect the drive during boot, whether that's physically yanking the cable or as you have done ignoring USB in BIOS.  I post this here so that others might have something to try if they are facing the same problem.  What tipped me off is that when I asked interactively to select the boot device, it said something like \"USB   USB-FDD\".  Floppies are usually formatted FAT so I thought I'd try it.

Infact, it's my everyday computer.\nTry this method to get it installed.\n\n\n*\n\n\n*Create a bootable USB drive. If you're uncertain about the process check this post.\n\n\n*Launch USB in Live Mode (try ubuntu without installing).\n\n*When it has booted verify disk type by firing up a terminal CTRL + ALT + T and run sudo parted -l. Look for Partition Table which shows the disk type. Make note of that.\n\n\nThe EFI partition (also called ESP) contains some boot files. It is necessary if the firmware (BIOS) is set up to boot the HDD in EFI mode (which is default on more and more modern, > year 2011 computers). It must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and have a \"boot\" flag. \n\n\n*Launch Gparted and create a partition of size 102MB with FAT32 and a flag of boot since it's gpt partition type. Make sure this partition is created before the first 100GB. To flag partition, right click partition > manage flags > boot. There will be a remaining roughly 249.xGB+. \n\n\n*Begin the ubuntu installation process. On the installation type screen, select Something else. From there select the remaining space 249.xGB+ and make a swap partition (the size of your Memory if you plan on hibernating else 4GB would be fine due to the amount of space you have available) and a root \"/ \" partition, which is the easiest partitioning scheme. However if you're looking for a more complex scheme, I would recommend this article.\n\nNote: Be carefully when creating the partitions as to not tamper with the boot partition create prior.\n\n\nThis should get you through to an installation.

Clearly no one has tried to do this but I don't have a windows 8 disc. I do however have a product key and that's all I need. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and I've installed the .exe file to download windows 8. I've installed wine and tried many things with wine thing and nothing is working. I need someone to tell me. step by step. how to do this so I can run windows 8 or maybe even 7 again and go on with my life.\n\nA: Short answer\nYou need installation or recovery media of the Windows version you want to install.\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain Windows 8.1 Update 1 installation media - I have Windows 8 Keys\n\n*Call the customer support hotline from the computer manufacturer or buy a download from Microsoft.\n\n\n\nWindows Upgrade Assistant and similar programs on Wine\nIf you are talking about the Upgrade Assistant it's very unlikely that this program will function under Wine as originally designed by Microsoft when running on Windows.\nThis is neither Microsoft's nor Wine's fault.\nIf this program actually completes successfully you would end up with all of the contents it tries to download and install in your Wine environment, because that is what this program seems to be designed to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the existing Windows environment to a newer version.\n\n*In case of Wine being the existing environment or \"Windows partition\", this would be ~/.wine/drive_c or ~/.wine64/drive_c respectively.\n\n*Even if you check the to option to do a clean install and not keep existing data, this program will still use the same partition and likely the same filesystem.\n\n\nI ran this program on my machine to update my initial Windows 7 installation to Windows 8 and in retrospect found the program behaving like above, where it actually should have created a new GPT partition table or converted the existing MBR partition table to GPT to be identical to preinstalled Windows 8 installations. But this would introduce a lot more of difficulties, dependencies and possible sources for failures. Also converting UEFI capable legacy machines to actual UEFI machines through such an application would be questionable and prompting the average user to confirm such an action also be very confusing.\nConclusion: You need installation or recovery media of the Windows version you want to install.\nIf your computer shipped to you in a pristine condition with a recovery partition and you wiped everything without backing up, you now know that backups are useful. Kindly ask the support hotline for help.\nNote: You can convert Windows 8 MBR installations to Windows 8 GPT by using DISM to backup (and restore), convert or create a GPT table, restore and run bcdboot. That is another topic though.\n\nA: Depending on what specific executable you are using, different wine settings are needed. Take a look if your application can be found at https://appdb.winehq.org/ for more information.\nI've been able to use the Dreamspark downloader in the past using playonlinux:\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\n\nA: I'm going to proceed in a different direction than those who answered before me.  I am going to assume, possibly incorrectly, that you are new to Wine and what you believe you are actually trying to do is to install a full working installation of Windows 8 as a Virtual Machine under Ubuntu, and you had been misled to believe Wine does that.\nAs far as I know, and I'm pretty handy with WINE, Wine does not permit the installation of the complete Windows installation within itself.  I don't believe that's what it was designed to do.  Wine can emulate many versions of Windows, Including Windows 7, in order to permit you to run software made to run best under those versions.  \nIf you wish to run a program such as MS-Word, using Wine, that's especially easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Ubuntu Software Center and, if you have already installed\nWINE, find it and uninstall WINE.\n\n*Install WINETRICKS. (winetricks installs more essential packages for\nrunning windows software than you'll otherwise discover)\n\n*Install PlayOnLinux.  (PlayOnLinux helps you to painlessly install\nyour old Windows applications such as Quicken, MS-office). \nInstalling Picasa under wine is a bigger ordeal but it is possible,\nand I've done it.\n\n*Open PlayOnLinux.\n\n*Click on the Install icon.\n\n\nThe reason for installing PlayOnLinux is that it has installation helpers which will permit you to install MS Word without difficulties.\nIf on the other hand you actually want to run an entire Windows Installation under Ubuntu, you can do that.  It requires going to the Ubuntu Software Center and searching for \"Virtualbox\", which is a VMware manager.  It was a lot easier to use than I thought it would be, but it was a real headache with regard to giving Windows access to Internet or CD drives.  For a friend hell-bent on using both Ubuntu and also running a particular windows game which was too finicky to work with WINE, such an installation was apparently necessary.\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu to my fresh HP laptop I have tried installing Ubuntu from both CD and a bootable usb device. But in both cases it doesn't even show the option to boot. It directly goes to my default DOS os. I am sure that I have arranged the boot priority orders in boot menu settings. Any solutions? \n\nA: Try with boot menu option - one of the \"Functuion\" keys, depends on the computer model and make. Then select manually the bootable media - USB or DVD. The boot menu displays all available boot devices.\n\nA: On HP laptops made prior to about 2008, such as the DV9000 I have here, instructions should appear in the lower left corner, instructions which may advise pressing F9 for a boot menu and F10 for CMOS setup.\nOn HP laptops made after about 2008, such as the DV6 I was asked to look at last week, things get a bit more complex.  By default NO instructions are issued on the screen at boot time, unless you **repeatedly tap the ESC key after turning the computer on.  From there you might get a boot menu, or you might see instructions for further F-keys to press for a boot menu or to configure the CMOS setup.\nIn last week's ordeal even after I got to that screen, I was unable to boot to the desired external USB medium because that laptop appears to require UEFI be installed...  I've learned that since then.  I have installed UEFI onto that external medium and I'm hoping to try it on the DV6 the next time its owner and I can meet up.  She's very interested in Ubuntu.

You should be able to boot to a previous version which will hopefully restore your GUI interface.  Ironically you can then uninstall whatever you did that made it stop working.  I had this very experience a couple of days ago, while experimenting on one of my \"Mubuntsticks\" in the quest to make Netflix work correctly under Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can you know if executing a program requires root? I understand that this is a bit fundamental and perhaps a silly question, but I haven't been able to find an answer.\nI understand that every file has the \"Executable\" bit.\nI assumed that programs that require root, that are owned by root user and root group will not have the Executable bit for Other and that would prevent non-root users executing those. But in the /bin and /sbin directories I see that all the files have permissions like -rwxr-xr-x\nSo what really determines if a user needs to have root permission to execute something?\n\nA: Sometime, it's in the code. For example, midway of hwclock.c, you'll find: \nif (getuid() == 0)\n            permitted = TRUE;\nelse {\n            /* program is designed to run setuid (in some situations) */\n            if (set || systohc || adjust) {\n                    warnx(_(\"Sorry, only the superuser can change \"\n                            \"the Hardware Clock.\"));\n[...]\n\nwhich will change the behavior of the program if you're root or not. \nIn most other cases, it's implicit; delegated to the kernel. For example, if the program calls the system call that let you reboot the system, it will work only if you are root. If you are not root, you will have a \"permission denied\" error that the application (if well written) simply reports to you. Or you are trying to delete a file; if you have the right permission on the file to do it, it will succeed; if not, it depends if you are root or not --- when rm calls unlink() the kernel will check permissions. \nSo no, in principle you can't say just looking at the permission of the executable if the program requires root privileges or not. A lot of programs will require them only for some operation, so it will be really difficult to do something like that. The case of hwclock is one (anyone can read the clock but only root can set it), but there are hundreds of them (kill, rm, cat... ) \nThen there is the related and interesting world of setuid programs... \n", "Q: Packages Broken not able to Play Videos Hi not able to play videos getting and unable to install video players too \ngstreamer1.0-libav : Depends: libavcodec54 (>= 6:9.1-1) but it is not going to be installed or\n                               libavcodec-extra-54 (>= 6:9.13) but it is not going to be installed\n                      Depends: libavformat54 (>= 6:9.1-1) but it is not going to be installed\n gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad : Depends: libchromaprint0 (>= 0.2) but it is not going to be installed\n                            Depends: libopencv-contrib2.4 but it is not going to be installed\n                            Depends: libopencv-highgui2.4 but it is not going to be installed\n                            Depends: libopencv-legacy2.4 but it is not going to be installed\n                            Depends: libopencv-objdetect2.4 but it is not going to be installed\n                            Depends: libopus0 (>= 1.0.3) but it is not going to be installed\n\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nPlease help \n\nA: I Just had to install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install libopus0 gstreamer1.0-liba\n\nAnd it is done.\nSource: ubuntu 14.04 problem with gstreamer1.0-libav\n", "Q: Horrible battery life with Ubuntu 14.04 on ThinkPad I've purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad S540, which has according to Lenovo '9 hours of battery life'.

I recenty upgraded a release from 12.04 to 14.04, and found out that my cgconfig.conf file is not being read anymore on startup.\nThe file appears to be correct, in the sense that I can explicitly load it with\nsudo cgconfigparser -l /etc/cgconfig.conf\n\nbut this doesn't happen automatically on reboot, which means other scripts run on startup fail (because they rely on cgexec with groups defined in cgconfig.conf).\nIs there something I need to do to have the file automatically used? (i.e. install some package) \nDo I have to somehow convert this file to some other ?\nThis used to work correctly before the upgrade, so I am confused as to what might be wrong.\nThe \"cgroup-lite\" package, which I think should be responsible for this, is also installed.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: This looks like a regression due to the fix for bug #1096771. There were some init scripts in cgroup-bin in 12.04, which were removed in 13.04. The /etc/init/cgconfig.conf service file contained this in the pre-start script stanza:\n/usr/sbin/cgconfigparser -l $CGCONFIG\n\nSo it was the cgconfig service from the cgroup-bin package that actually set up your cgroup configuration. cgroup-lite hasn't changed much in between these releases, so I assume it isn't meant to read this configuration. I recommend that you open a bug report (and perhaps write a new Upstart service (or copy the old one) since it's unlikely they'll change this in an LTS release).\n\nSince 12.04 is still supported, you can use the Packages index to download the older version of the package.

How do I fix this?\nI see my screen but I cannot use the keyboard\n\nA: I've fielded this question a few times over the past few years, and my rule of thumb is to explain that there are many laptops for which it is nearly impossible to install the correct drivers to put it to sleep properly without encountering the problem you describe (or worse).  In such cases your only option is to configure your power settings to do something besides putting the computer to sleep when the lid is closed.\nUnder \"System Settings\", \"Power\", you can select the correct action for what to do when the lid is closed.  Your options should include such choices as, stay on, go to sleep, or shut down.

If user 2 signs in he only gets to see the folder music. And if user 3 sings in he only can see the folder school.\nSo the idea is to hide folders for users that are not allowed to see those. How can you configure this using samba server. \nEDIT: If they can't read the content of the folders it's also okay, if hiding folders isn't possible or harder to do. \nThank you for helping!\nIf you need more info please ask.\n\nA: The easiest way would be to create a Linux user account for your 3 users and just have them to sign in to one big shared folder. To do so you will first have to install the gnome system tools with the following command \n  sudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\nAfter you did this go to your user accounts and click the lock button and add your accounts. \nNow open the gnome tool we just installed, it’s called users and groups. \nClick on an account, select advanced and enter your pass. Go straight to the advanced tab and change shell to /bin/false. Also it’s recommended to generate a random password for the samba accounts so you can’t sign in to them on the Linux machine.\nYou can also change the user ID to a number lower as 1000 This way it will hide the account on your Linux machine. I recommend you to do this after you are sure everything is working 100%\nNow do the same for the other account.\n\nAfter that you make 3 samba accounts and link them to the Linux user accounts. Like shown in the following image: \n\nNow it’s just a matter of changing permissions on the folders. I will use the student and school folder as an example. \nOpen an terminal and enter the following command \n gksudo nautilus\n\nenter your password and click okay. Now browse to your shared folder and go to the folder school, right click on it and go to properties, select permissions. \nNow you can set properties for users and groups to allow them to enter folders. In this example we want the owner to have full control and the student to only access the files and others get no access. So you would get this: \n\nNow it is just a matter of repeating the previous steps to give the other accounts the wanted access and permissions. \nI hope this answered your question. \n", "Q: How to list all installed/activated Apache modules on a server To (roughly) check for the CVE-2014-6271 vulnerability and to have better general insight.\nI want to check if a server uses mod_cgi or mod_cgid modules\nHow do I list all installed / activated Apache modules on a running Ubuntu Apache HTTP server?\nI can use this:\napache2ctl -l\n\nbut that shows only the compiled-in modules.\n\nA: apache2ctl -M\n\nwill do the job and it's equivalent with:\napache2ctl -t -D DUMP_MODULES\n\nYou can see also apache2ctl -h.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 12.04 on Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 on my PC, but now I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 along with Ubuntu 14.04\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu 12.04 on Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: I think that... unless you intend to get into VMware, what you need to do is install 12.04 \"side by side\" with 14.04 in separate partitions, so that what you will have is a dual boot.  This is easier than you might think.  If you boot to an ubuntu live 12.04 and select install, it will detect the current installation and offer you the choice of installing 12.04 alongside the current installation.  It will then proceed to partition the hard drive to make room for the new installation.\nIf instead you are literally interested in making 12.04 run UNDER 14.04, then you need to enter the Ubuntu Software Center, and type \"virtualbox\", sans quotes.  Virtualbox is remarkably easy to figure out and use, and I've found that the online tutorials for Oracle vmware for Windows appear to apply to this application as well.\nI've never actually installed any versions of ubuntu, under virtualbox, only versions of Windows, but I suppose you have your reasons.\n", "Q: Ran in low graphics mode I ran into low graphics mode after following answer from here: How do I install the Nvidia driver for a GeForce GT 630\n\nA: Ironically it was a different page on this site regarding the alteration of nvidia drivers which brought me to this site today, and it is why I'm trying to get my points up.  I have a LOT TO SAY about the advice offered there, and I feel many of those giving the advice are not giving especially good advice, or specifically offering some relatively harmful advice.  Thanks to your question, I may be able to offer some of the advice here that I would have added there.\nPlease open a terminal and type:\n\ndpkg -l | grep -i nvidia\n\nThis will show you a list of what has been installed.  Removing each package you don't want is not too hard with the apt-get purge command, but you have to do it separately for each package or risk removing a package which is apparently harmful to remove, hence my desire to post a comment to that thread, as I figured out a harmless way to do that.\nMy advice to you or to anyone else wishing to install particular nvidia drivers without the headaches is to install the Synaptic Package Manager (which can be found in your Ubuntu Software Center, if you have not already installed it).  Once in Synaptic you can type NVIDIA and peruse all sorts of packages, but more importantly you can return there to an installation log and UNDO your previous mistake.  Being able to retrace your steps and undo your failures is a very important feature.\nPERSONALLY I'm thankful I found the pages here as they helped me to remove some nvidia drivers which had been plaguing my installation for the past six months or so.  As I understand it, these drivers aren't necessarily needed anymore since apparently it is no longer necessary to use Nvidia's proprietary drivers in order to make their graphics cards work right.\n", "Q: No boot after reseting bios to default, Ubuntu partition gone I set my bios to their default settings in order to try and boot a Lubuntu Live-cd but something I didn't consider is that it would wipe out my Ubuntu boot-entries.

Unless there's more I don't understand, that should not have deleted an \"entries\".  \nI suspect that what has actually happened is that resetting your CMOS changed the default boot sequence so that your computer is attempting to boot to some other attached drive, such as a blank SD card or USB flash drive you left plugged in.

I use Ubuntu 14.04 on a laptop, usually with an external usb mouse and keyboard and screen connected. Sometimes, however, I unplug all of them and move the laptop and keep using it with the builtin keyboard and screen and touchpad.\nAt random times it happens that the touchpad stops working (but if I plug the usb mouse, the usb mouse does work). Though this happens very rarely, when it does it's a great annoyance, as I'm forced to reboot if I need the touchpad to work again.\nIs there some workaround that I can try, such as killing some process that would automatically restart, or some command that would cause the touchpad driver to restart or refresh or something? Anything that may \"wake up\" the touchpad without having to reboot?\n\nA: I found a way to do this:\nFirst, open a terminal, and print out all input devices to find the id you need for the input device you want to disable. In terminal, type:\nxinput --list\n\nNext: Notice where it says id=X in one long column for every input device. You want to find the device id that corresponds to the input device you want to disable (Maybe something that sounds like \"touchpad\"). Then replace X in the following command with the id number representing the input device you want to disable:\nxinput disable X\n\nNote: If you're not sure which device id you should use to disable the touchpad, then you can find out by testing random id's and seeing if your mouse pad still works. Make sure you are NOT DOING ANYTHING IMPORTANT. Save all your work and be prepared to restart your computer if you do something like disable your keyboard. (You may have trouble trying to enable it again if you can't type into the terminal.\nThen you'll have to run this last line (Thanks for catching this Arch Stanton!)\nxinput enable X\n\nReason: I desperately needed an answer to this problem because the problems I was experiencing with my touchpad made doing any kind of work impossible. Suddenly, at some random moment when using my laptop, for apparently no reason, my touchpad goes into some kind of \"special mode\". Merely moving one finger on my touchpad would cause the screen to scroll, instead of actually moving the cursor of the mouse on the screen so it was impossible to get the mouse to hover over anything in broswer without considerable coordinating efforts to account for the scrolling screen and non moving mouse. I wanted to find a way, WITHOUT RESTARTING THE LAPTOP, to reset the touchpad. On the plus side, resetting the touchpad with the method above actually fixes my problem.\nUpdate:\nTo make resetting the touchpad even easier, I made a hotkey for the above listed commands. When my touchpad goes on the fritz, I simply do the key combination ctrl+super+r and it does the reset for me. Quick and easy.\nHere's how:\n-Create a file inside your home directory and call it something like \"touchpad-reset.sh\".\n-Inside this file, put in two of the three (the last two) previous commands listed above except, instead of using an X id number for the device, since it's subject to change with added peripherals (maybe??) you can do use this instead:\nHere's an output from my computer inside the terminal using this commmand:\nxinput --list\n\nResult:\nVirtual core pointer                        id=2    [master pointer  (3)]⎜   \n   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                 id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]⎜   \n   ↳ Genius 2.4G Wireless Mouse                 id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]⎜   \n   ↳ MSFT0001:00 06CB:75BD UNKNOWN              id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]⎜   \n   ↳ ELAN Touchscreen                           id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]⎜ \n\n-Now what you do, you replace the X (which was an id before) for xinput disable X and xinput enable X with the name corresponding to that id inside single quotes. For example, from the above, if you wanted to do it for id=13, my touchpad device, you would use:\nxinput disable 'MSFT0001:00 06CB:75BD UNKNOWN'\nxinput enable 'MSFT0001:00 06CB:75BD UNKNOWN'\n\n-So now, you're disabling by name instead of ID number, where an id may possibly change in time and then you'd be disabling and enabling some other device.\nFinally, you need to give the permissions to make this file executable; run this command with your working directory in the terminal as your home directory (where you created the file):\nchmod +x your_script_name.sh\n\nSo once you make this file with the appropriate commands written inside, making sure it's in your home directory, take the following steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the super key (windows key on PC) on keyboard to bring up the unity side bar. Type in 'system settings' and press the enter key.\n\n*Find the 'Keyboard' option under where it says 'Hardware' and click on it.\n\n*Select the 'Shortcuts' tab.\n\n*In the left window, select 'Custom Shortcuts'\n\n*Click on the + button near the bottom center.\n\n*A window should pop up asking for a description name and a command to put in.\n\n*Make the name something like \"reset touchpad\"\n\n*Use this command: gnome-terminal -x ./name_of_your_script.sh\n\n*Click on 'Apply'\n\n*You should now see your shortcut listed and on the far right it should say \"Disabled\" or some other garbage. Click on that text and be prepared to make some kind of key combination, perhaps like ctrl+super+r.\n\n*Once you make this key combination, you're done.\n\n\nCongrats! Have fun.\n\nA: For me, on kernel 4.13.0-46 on Asus for ELAN1200, it wasn't about reloading elan_i2c but the hid-multitouch driver:  \nsudo modprobe -r hid-multitouch && sudo modprobe hid-multitouch\n\n\nA: Here is what was working for me is [Zenbook ASUS UX501VW]:\nsudo  modprobe -r elan_i2c\nsudo  modprobe elan_i2c\n\nAnd my missing touch pad is back.\n\nA: I was having that problem with one laptop repeatedly until I noticed that the touchpad of that computer had its own On/Off switch which I must have been hitting by accident.

I hit Fn-F2 and ran it again - now \"Hard Blocked\" was changed to \"No\". \nFrom that point in GNome Network Manager I already had the option to pick my network SSID and enter my WPA passphrase - all is well, I am up and running on wireless.\nThanks to everybody!\n\nA: The Dell D600 series is probably my all-time favorite laptop.  I have several in various states of disrepair, the newest being a 610.  Years ago I actually had difficulty making the included Broadcom mini PCI cards in them work and had to replace them with Intel mini PCI cards.  In recent years it appears Linux has supported all the Broadcom cards I've thrown at it, although if I recall correctly there's a minor trick to it.  You have to connect the computer to the internet using an ethernet cable and then do a system update to give it the opportunity to automatically download the correct drivers.\nIf after doing that it still doesn't work, I'd advise you do what I've done to install drivers for lesser-recognized wireless devices.  I (install and) open the Synaptic Package Manager, and then search for what I'm looking for.  Looking at it now on your behalf and using the search parameters \"broadcom bcm\" (without quotes), I see only four choices with the most promising possibly being \"b43-fwcutter\".\n", "Q: Youtube doesn't work anymore in firefox (Ubuntu 14.04) Title says it all. Whenever I try to play a Youtube video I get the error messages:\n\nYour browser does not recognize any of the video formats available\n\nIt worked fine just before I installed the pipelight plugin. I am very confused and annoyed at this. My Youtube still works fine in chrome.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nUbuntu Restricted Extras is a software package for the computer\n  operating system Ubuntu that allows the user to install essential\n  software which is not already included due to legal or copyright\n  reasons.\nIt is a meta-package that installs:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Support for MP3 and unencrypted DVD playback\n  \n*Microsoft TrueType core fonts\n  \n*Adobe Flash plugin\n  \n*codecs for common audio and video files\n  \n\n\nA: Check to see if you have FlashFirebug installed as an add-on, and if so disable it.  That's what got YouTube working for me again in Firefox after it mysteriously stopped working.  I am running Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Installing freshplayerplugin did the trick for me on a fresh install with the same issue (adobe-flashplugin from \"partner\" repository did not work) :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin\n\n\nA: I recently sent out an update on my personal Ubuntu support list so that people wouldn't feel stupid trying to overcome this difficulty.  \nThe problem you are experiencing is actually not related to the version of Ubuntu.  Many of my friends who upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 assumed that somehow broke you-tube or Firefox, but in fact it was just a matter of timing.  I know this for certain because their complaints came in at the same time that I was (and am) still using 12.04, and I was having the same problems.\nIn my case the ADOBE FLASH driver required to watch both Hulu and You-tube first stopped working under my installation of the \"chromium\" web browser, and then about a month later Firefox too suffered this change.  I was annoyed and several of my Ubuntu friends as well, so after one of them who is too proud to ask for my help took his laptop to Best Buy's Geek Squad and paid them $120 to re-install Firefox... which didn't even help, I decided to see what could be done, before anyone else tried something equally fruitless and expensive.\nAt that time what I did was to install the \"Chrome-beta\" web browser (not the original Chromium) and that somehow overcame the problem.  If I understand you correctly, the regular Chrome web browser also works, I'll alert my friends.\nIt is truly unfortunate for Ubuntu that this issue of timing has started the false rumor (which I've been hearing for weeks now) that upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 somehow makes it impossible to watch Youtube videos.\n**UPDATE December 21, 2014:  **\nI've been wrestling with the idea of deleting this post.  It offends me that I received ANY down-votes from people simply because the BETA version of chrome I recommended was out of BETA not long after.  \nIn any case, it seems that the Google Chrome browser worked better for me than the Google ChromIUM browser which was the only version listed in the software center.  It is possible that by this date, all browser work equally well but that's not what I continue to hear from frustrated Ubuntu users who turn to this site for help, which is why I'm choosing to update this answer instead of deleting it... for now.\nHere is the link I last used to help a friend install the Google Chrome browser on their laptop and permit them to once again view videos.\n", "Q: Is it safe to manually remove packages that apt-get remove/autoremove left behind? Facts:\nYesterday I installed openjdk-7-jre in a Ubuntu Server 14.04, which installed over 100+ packages.\nLater, I realized that I would only need to install openjdk-7-headless.\nThen I uninstalled openjdk-7-jre with apt-get remove and also apt-get autoremove.\nHowever, this process only removed a small subset of the whole openjdk-7-jre package and its dependencies.\nQuestions:\n1 - Is it safe to manually remove each one of the dependencies packages listed by the entry in /var/log/apt/history.log regarding the initial installation of openjdk-7-jre?\n2 - Why the remove/autoremove commands didn't remove the whole package (jre + dependencies), since I haven't done anything else between the initial installation and the later remove/autoremove commands?\n\nA: Yes it is,  Ubuntu/Linux never let's you remove something that is important in boot systems,  unless you use GEdit\n", "Q: Efficient way to get last modified/created files I have a folder that has a lot of files (various logs generated by a website).\nManaged to count them with:\n$ find . -maxdepth 1|wc -l\n803313\n\nNow I need to check the logs in the past few days. Getting the last 100 / 1000 / ... files is just as good. The problem is the above command took about 5 seconds. So, at almost 1 million files, my regular ls -lrt|tail -n 100 isn't an option.\nSo, any ideas on how to efficiently get the last modified files ?\nPS: Using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nA: You can use printf to print the date, %T@ gives you the modification time like a unix timestamp:\nfind . -type f -printf \"%T@ %p\\n\" | sort -rn | head -n 10\n\nOn a folder with 250.000 files it takes 10 seconds.\nSidenote: To find the most recent file very quickly, you can use\nfind . -type f -printf \"%T@\\0%p\\0\" | gawk ' { if ($0>max) { max=$0; getline mostrecent } else getline } END{print mostrecent}' RS='\\0'\n\nThis takes less than 2 seconds on 250.000 files.\n\nA: Find itself can filter files within a time range. You said you wanted files newer than a few days ago:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -ctime -3\n\nThis will find all files changed in the past 3 days. \nYou can use -ctime (file status changes), -mtime (file's data changes) and -atime (file accessed changes).\nIf you need more granularity, use -cmin, -mmin and -amin (which use minutes instead of days).\nThe time range can be a plain number or use +/- signs, as follows:\n  Numeric arguments can be specified as\n\n   +n     for greater than n,\n\n   -n     for less than n,\n\n   n      for exactly n.\n\nso -mtime -3 will give you files modified 3 days (and less) ago. -mtime 3 will give you files modified 3 days ago (note that fractional parts are discarded, so this will give you files modified between 3 and 4 days ago). -mtime +3 will give all files modified 3 (and more) days ago.\n", "Q: WIFI is Diasbled by Hardware switch in Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit on HP-430 laptop Please help in resolving wifi connection issue.\nWIFI is Diasbled by Hardware switch in Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit on HP-430 laptop\nrfkill list all result is as follows,\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n2: hp-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n3: hp-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n\n\nA: I met the same situation stated above 30 minutes ago, but in reading answers on forums, I got the answer by chance. \nFor this HP laptop, the original Fn + F1-F12 has been changed under Ubuntu to FN + Ctrl + F1-F12... The kids should have touched the FN + Ctrl + F11 during their gaming...\nI hope this may help some people in the similar situations. And I'll be glad to hear how to change these combinations under Ubuntu or Lubuntu, or how to find complete documentation on this issue concerning different producers.\n\nA: I seemed to have \"fixed\" this, more by luck than design. I tried suggestions such as rfkill unblock all with no success. Also every type of possible key combination and the wireless (F12) key, also no luck. The comment above saying that FN is now FN + Ctrl didn't help.\nI shutdown and then entered BIOS and chose \"Reset to default\" (0r something similar). Now wireless works, the light on the F12 key is now blue and not orange. \nI'm only calling this a partial fix as I can now turn on and off wifi using the \"Enable Wifi\" option from the pulldown menu at the top right, but the button still doesn't do anything. When I switch wifi off using the pulldown, button turns orange, turns blue again when I turn on. \nHope this helps and works for other HP 431 owners out there.\nJB\n\nA: Resetting the bios to default on my HP Pavilion worked. I installed Fedora and both my Panda stick and internal Realtek card were recognized.\n\nA: I am using HP Pavilion 15-r007tx. I am also having the same problem but I have a solution. Enable by hardware switch means you have to enable your wifi by hardware while booting. While booting, when you first select *Ubuntu from the first menu, it is followed by a black screen which then eventually shows the login page. We have to enable wifi immediately when the black screen appears. Press fn + f12 key while in that black screen time interval. You will see something like ^[[12]~ appear on your screen. This means you have enabled your wifi successfully. Now just let the login page appear and you will have your wifi working properly from now on. \nIf you shut down your system properly then you do not have to do this every time you boot your system. Anytime you see this problem just restart and use the above trick.\n", "Q: install Brother MFC-J6510DW I have downloaded the drivers for this printer/scanner/fax and installed them but somehow the printer doesn't print, it responds to the computer when I give a print command but that's it.\nSince yesterday I'm using Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (new Toshiba laptop deleted crappy windows 8)before this I had Ubuntu 12.04 and Lubuntu 12.04.\nMy other printer, a Brother HL-2130 laser, I have no problems whit. \nAnyone knows what I might be doing wrong or any suggestions? \n\nA: Please visit; Brother Drivers for Linux® distributions and read Linux Informations for system requirements, installation procedures etc.\nAfter you have done so proceed as followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose either: \n\n\n\nPrinter (CUPS): Driver Install or\n  Printer (LPR) : Driver Install\n\n\n\n*Depending on your choice, proceed to follow the commands to install the required driver or (easy way) download the .deb file and install your drivers through USC (Ubuntu Software Center).\n\n", "Q: Trying to merge .avi videos with mencoder I started by using the suggestions found at this link:\nHow to join video files from terminal?\nIt worked for the first 6 times that I tried to merge a group of small .avi files into one larger file.

You can install it using sudo apt-get install mutt\n", "Q: Can you transfer Steam games from one Ubuntu Laptop to another? This question is about importing steam games from Windows to Ubuntu so is similar but I don't think a duplicate. \nA little on my situation, I have an old laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 and have Steam installed with some games downloaded or part-downloaded. I've got a new laptop also running ubuntu 14.04 and have installed steam. I have not yet opened steam. If it makes any difference my old laptop only has one HDD whereas my new machine has / on a SSD and /home on a HDD and user name is the same on both.\nIs there an easy way to transfer my steam game files from my old laptop to my new one?\n\nA: Unless you have setup separate libraries, Steam on Linux stores all the games in the .local/share/Steam/SteamApps, which is the equivalent of the Windows Steam client's SteamApps folder. So just copy this folder.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a Mac with USB stick made on Windows/Ubuntu I've been searching all over the internet with absolutely no luck, just how to triple boot, which doesn't help me at all.\nI have a MacBook Pro (2007) and I attempted to upgrade the OS. It fails every time so I'm stuck in a loop, and cannot do anything about it.\nMy only other computers are my Windows box, and an Ubuntu box. Is there any way I can make a bootable USB stick of Ubuntu 14.04 to install Ubuntu onto this MacBook Pro? Or do I NEED to use a Mac to make the image?\n\nA: You make the image with any OS.\nCreate a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu\nTo create a USB stick from which you can install Ubuntu, you must first download Ubuntu. Then, follow these instructions:\n1.\nInsert a USB stick with at least 2GB of free space.\n2.\nOpen the dash and search for Startup Disk Creator.\n3.\nSelect the Startup Disk Creator to launch the app.\n4\nClick 'Other' to choose the downloaded ISO file.\n5\nSelect the file and click 'Open'.\n6\nSelect the USB stick in the bottom box and click 'Make Startup Disk'.\n7\nThat’s it! When the process completes, you’ll be ready to restart your computer and begin installing Ubuntu.\nCreate a bootable USB stick on OS X\n1.Download Ubuntu Desktop.\n2\nOpen the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight).\n3\nConvert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil e.g.,\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso\nNote: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n4\nRun diskutil list to get the current list of devices.\n5\nInsert your flash media.\n6\nRun diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2).\n7\nRun diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN \n(replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2).\n8\nExecute \nsudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\n(replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.img or ./ubuntu.dmg).\n\n\n*\n\n*Using /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster\n\n*If you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd. Use the same command but replace bs=1m with bs=1M\n\n*If you see the error dd: /dev/diskN: Resource busy, make sure the disk is not in use. Start the 'Disk Utility.app' and unmount (don't eject) the drive\n\n\n9\nRun\ndiskutil eject /dev/diskN\nand remove your flash media when the command completes.\n10\nRestart your Mac and press alt/option key while the Mac is restarting to choose the USB stick.\n\nIf Ubuntu is not available in grub, run sudo update-grub\n", "Q: shortcut to send selection to terminal in geany So i've set up the geany to use with the terminal. My next question is how to set up a keyboard shortcut to send the currently selected code to the terminal?\n\nA: By default there's no such shortcut defined but you can easily assign a new one.\nOpen the Edit -> Preferences (Ctrl+Alt+p) menu and click on the Keybindings tab:\n\nScroll down into the \"Format\" category to find and select a \"Send Selection to Terminal\" action. Click the Change button to assign a new shortcut and you can now send your selection to the VTE Terminal:\n\n", "Q: How expensive or hard would it be to add RUN button into Software Manager? I teach Linux and quite frequently install new software, test it and remove it. I promote the use of Linux and recommend it to my relatives and friends. One common use case is I hear what people need, so I try different programs which suits best for ones needs. For example, I tested loads of kids games for my niece, found only few which suited for her age. It is infuriating to search each game or app from menu, when you could just RUN it from where you installed it, then Remove it if its not suitable and search for yet another app.\nOther platforms have this (Android, IOS, Windows at least) and for a good reason. It just is so intuitive to launch an app right after you installed it. \nThis button will in no way hinder those who run there apps some other way, from terminal or menu.\nIf I was able to do this myself, how big task would it be? If I was to pay for somebody to do this, how much would it cost? I want to estimate how difficult this thing is, so I would be wiser as to pursuit it or forget it.\n\nA: This seems like a fairly simple task if you are acquainted well with the software-center codebase. It should be possible to use dpkg, apt or just manually scrape the Applications directory (/usr/share/applications/) to find the main .desktop file associated with a file and run it automatically when the button is pressed.\nHowever, if you wanted to pay someone else to write the code for that instead and have it merged into the software-center codebase, I imagine it would cost you between $50-250, depending on who you ask and how well you can convince them that it is useful.\n", "Q: lost access to executable file (file not found) I am trying to execute a file that I have recently run. However the system says file is not found?\nThe file was taking a long time to execute and in the end I had to close the Terminal window that was executing the file, and then reopen it and this problem occured.\nPreviously I was in the directory ~/poky/build-atmel $ and simply executed the command \n$ bitbake\n\nbut the system does no longer recognizes the command.\nHowever, if I try \n$ ~/poky/bitbake/bin/bitbake \n\nthe file is recognised OK.\nWhat could have happened to the ability of the system to know where the file was and how do I resurrect it. I could add the directory to the $PATH variable but there is some other issue here .\nI would appreciate any insight into this problem. At present I have just  added the directory to the PATH statement to solve the problem.\nThanks\nLachlan\n\nA: Maybe you had the command in your PATH after the setup, but a setup can not make the change to your PATH permanent.\nEdit .bashrc in your home directory and add the following line:\nexport PATH=~/poky/bitbake/bin:$PATH\n\nThis will add that directory to the PATH environment variable permanently.\n", "Q: X service wont start how to start x server? my display shows a flashing cursor.

Remember to make it executable using:\nchmod +x fail-ignore-script.sh\n\n", "Q: How do you call g++? I wanted to use g++. However, when I type in g++ in the terminal, it says, \"fatal error no input files\". I have asked a similar question before but to avoid extending the discussion in the comments, i have asked this solely for g++. I would also like to know the type of files that are compiled .i.e the nature of the file.\n\nA: In Ubuntu you can append --help onto most commands to see more information about how to run them. In this case:\n$ g++ --help\nUsage: g++ [options] file...\nOptions:\n   ....\n\nYou can also look at man g++ which will tell you lots more but here's the synopsis:\nSYNOPSIS\n       gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard]\n           [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]\n           [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic]\n           [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]\n           [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro]\n           [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...]\n           [-o outfile] [@file] infile...\n\nThe short of it is you need to provide a filename to your source file. Eg:\ng++ test.cpp\n\n\nA: If you have a .cpp file, you can compile it with g++ and then run the compiled file. For example:\ng++ testfile.cpp -o testfile\n\n(The -o option tells the compiler (g++) the executable output file's name. In fact, you can change the output filename to whatever you want apart from source file name.)\nThen you can execute the compiled file with:\n./testfile\n\nExecutable files are run using ./ from the same directory.\n", "Q: No space left on the device though there is space I am copying file and I got an error message saying \"no space left on the device\".\nroot@nn:~# df -h\nFilesystem                                       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/xvda2                                       5.9G  5.9G     0 100% /\nudev                                              98M  4.0K   98M   1% /dev\ntmpfs                                             48M  196K   48M   1% /run\nnone                                             5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                                             120M     0  120M   0% /run/shm\n172.17.253.254:/q/groups/ch-geni-net/Hadoop-NET  198G  108G   75G  59% /groups/ch-geni-net/Hadoop-NET\n172.17.253.254:/q/proj/ch-geni-net               198G  108G   75G  59% /proj/ch-geni-net\n/dev/xvda4                                       7.9G  147M  7.4G   2% /mnt\nroot@nn:~# \n\n\nroot@nn:~# df -i\nFilesystem                                       Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on\n/dev/xvda2                                       385024 107796  277228   28% /\nudev                                              25038    388   24650    2% /dev\ntmpfs                                             30537    262   30275    1% /run\nnone                                              30537      4   30533    1% /run/lock\nnone                                              30537      1   30536    1% /run/shm\noverflow                                          30537      4   30533    1% /tmp\n/dev/xvda4                                       524288     12  524276    1% /mnt\n172.17.253.254:/q/groups/ch-geni-net/Hadoop-NET 8752638 443710 8308928    6% /groups/ch-geni-  net/Hadoop-NET\n172.17.253.254:/q/proj/ch-geni-net              8752638 443710 8308928    6% /proj/ch-geni-net\nroot@nn:~#\nroot@nn:~# \n\nWhy cant it use /dev/xvda4 when /dev/xvda2 is full ? /dev/xvda4 is newly mounted.

It gives you a hint of the type of object it is.\nIt can have following values.\n\n\n*\n\n*d (directory)\n\n*c (character device)\n\n*l (symlink)\n\n*p (named pipe)\n\n*s (socket)\n\n*b (block device)\n\n*D (door)\n\n*-  (regular file)\n\n\n\nr represents read permission.\nw represents write permission and \nx represents executable permission.\nFirst combination of rwx represents permission for the owner .\nSecond combination of rwx represents permission for the group .\nThird combination of rwx represents permission for the other of the file.\n\nOctal notation\nPermission of file can also be represented in octal notation.\nIn octal notation\nRead or r is represented by 4,\nWrite or w is represented by 2 \nExecute x is represented by 1.\nSum of these three is use to represent the permission.\nstat command can be used to view file permission in octal notation \n  stat -c \"%a %n\" /path/of/file\n\nFor example\n   stat -c \"%a %n\" acroread \n   755 acroread\n\nHere you can see \nFor owner it is 4+2+1=7 (111 in binary)\nFor group it is 4+0+1=5 (101 in binary) and\nFor other it is 4+0+1=5 (101 in binary).\n\nA: Regardless of your actually using ACL permissions, if you have the acl package installed, you can use getfacl <path> to get a pretty decent breakdown of permissions on that file.\n$ getfacl /root/\n# file: root/\n# owner: root\n# group: root\nuser::rwx\ngroup::---\nother::---\nIf you do use ACL permissions, it'll tell you about permissions that ls and stat just can't.\n$ sudo setfacl -m u:oli:r /root\n$ getfacl /root/\n# file: root/\n# owner: root\n# group: root\nuser::rwx\nuser:oli:r--\ngroup::---\nmask::r--\nother::---\n\nA: You can also see file permission by right-clicking the file and selecting properties and there you will find permissions.\n", "Q: How to cache pgp passphrase permanently with seahorse (14.04) I am trying to get seahorse-daemon (formerly seahorse-agent) to cache the passphrase for private pgp keys permanently.\nI have used dconf-editor to set gpg-cache-method to always, but the setting is ignored, seahorse prompts for passphrase entry every time the key is used.\nInterestingly I have six machines all running 14.04 with latest updates, and I can't figure out why some of them do cache the passphrase permanently while others don't.Thanks in advance for any ideas.\n\nA: To permanently save the a passphrase in the keyring, use seahorse-ssh-askpass from package seahorse:\n/usr/lib/seahorse/seahorse-ssh-askpass my_key\n\nNote: You have to have a have the corresponding .pub file in the same directory as the private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in the example). Also, make sure that the public key is the file name of the private key plus .pub (for example, my_key.pub).\n", "Q: How to become superuser without terminal I have accidentally edited bash.bashrc and made it run a wrong command so I cannot enter any terminal window at all. How can I become superuser without sudo su in the terminal, so I can reedit and correct bash? \nKdeSudo does't work either.\n\nA: Does the below help?\ngksudo gedit ~/.bashrc\n\nYou could always run a terminal and tell Bash to ignore that rc file:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash --norc'\n\n\nA: If you are unable to open a terminal CtrlAltT, You can get to a system prompt by CtrlAltF1 and when finished, return to the GUI interface with CtrlAltF7\n\nA: Possible solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter from another tty (not from graphical one .eg tty1)\n\n*use shortcuts ,if works\n\n*restart and enter recovery mode, then select shell prompt\n\n*Close computer, enter live cd and edit bashrc. then Restart and see what happens?\n\n", "Q: Enabling, disabling camera from terminal How do I enable and disable the laptop's camera from the terminal? And how will I know if it is on or of?\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open the terminal.\nWhen it opens, run command to disable the camera until reboot:\nsudo modprobe -r uvcvideo\n\nYou will be asked for your password, and after typing it, if there are no errors shown in the terminal, your webcam should be disabled.\nTo enable your webcam again, run:\nsudo modprobe uvcvideo\n\n\nA: As a complement to @Otto answer, you also asked how to check whether the camera is actually disabled or not. In order to do so you can check if the module is loaded or not using lsmod which shows the status of modules in the Linux kernel.\nThe module you disables in @Otto's answer is uvcvideo, therefore, you can check if it is loaded like this:\nlsmod | grep uvcvideo\n\nThe output should be similar to this when the module is enabled:\nuvcvideo               98304  0\nvideobuf2_vmalloc      20480  1 uvcvideo\nvideobuf2_v4l2         24576  1 uvcvideo\nvideobuf2_common       49152  2 videobuf2_v4l2,uvcvideo\nvideodev              225280  3 videobuf2_v4l2,uvcvideo,videobuf2_common\nmc                     53248  4 videodev,videobuf2_v4l2,uvcvideo,videobuf2_common\n\nAnd when it is disabled no occurrences to uvcvideo should be returned from the command.\n", "Q: xorg display problem - user cannot login I was having an error all day.

Why still extra ffmpeg codecs for the chromium browser in ubuntu update? Chromium kept crashing on the gmail webpage (aw snap) and I have uninstalled it and installed goggle chrome.\nIn software updater, I see \"extra ffmpeg codecs for the chromium browser\" is this for google chrome?\n\nA: According to the output of apt-cache depends google-chrome-stable, nothing with codecs or ffmpeg is part of google-chrome-stable dependencies. If you want, you can safely remove \"extra ffmpeg codecs for the chromium browser\". To see this for yourself, open a terminal and run the code given above.\nIf you later change your mind and want to go back to Chromium, the system will re-install the necessary dependencies for you.\n\nA: The right answer was here.\nTo uninstall just the codecs:  \nsudo apt-get remove chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra.\nAfter running this command, close Ubuntu Software Center and try installing Chromium again, and it won't show the error.  \nIn case there are still package issues, uninstall codecs and dependencies: \nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra.\n", "Q: Is there a global shortcut for creating strikethrough text?

Should I be confident that Ubuntu would be similarly as stable with the AMD A8-6500B as the certified processor?  Thanks in advance.   \n\nA: No. Those APUs are not even from the same family.

I have a script (actually, a Rails application with a Sidekiq job queue system), which uploads pictures and albums to Flickr. This data is huge for my purposes (around 100GB), and the upload is slow due to my low internet speed.\nI have already configured the script to run when Ubuntu boots, as well as have init.d interface for controlling this script.\nNow, since the uploading consumes all my bandwidth, I want to run this script only when the internet connection is idle, i.e. the script should pause automatically when the internet connection is being used by other applications, and resume once it becomes idle again.\nSo, I would like to know if there is a way that I can monitor my internet connection and check to see if other applications are connected online. If so, the script pauses itself, and resumes when the connection becomes idle again.\nAny pointers or help in this regard is appreciated.\n\nA: You can use /proc/net/dev to monitor network activity, something like this:\npackets() {\n    # Get the number of packets of eth0 device\n    cat /proc/net/dev | grep eth0 | cut -f5 -d' ';\n}\n\nLAST=$(packets)\n\nwhile [ true ]; do\n    sleep 1;\n    PACKS=$(packets)\n    DIFF=$(($PACKS-$LAST));\n    # I consider idle less than 10 packets per second\n    if [ $DIFF -le 10 ]; then\n        echo 'Idle!';\n    fi\n    LAST=$PACKS;\ndone\n\nThe trick here is what you consider idle, since zero traffic is a real world impossibility :)\n", "Q: Unable to access 64gb volume - Ubuntu 14.04 I'm unable to mount Sandisk 64GB SDXC card.\nThis error shown while connecting using my phone.\n \nI tried this, this and this links, but unable to find any solution.\nI've tried the below commands to install the exfat, \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:relan/exfat\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exfat-utils fuse-exfat\n\nBut below error displayed in terminal,\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nfuse-exfat : Depends: fuse-utils (>= 2.7) but it is not installable\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: There is no need to add extra repo.

I've been reading about the CVE-2014-6271 bug on lots of pages, but I'm still not able to understand how exactly is it possible to exploit it over ssh.\nFrom all I've read, I couldn't find an example that executes a piece of code without being authenticated.\nI'm just trying to understand the bug better, no hacking involved.\nAs per\nhttps://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/09/24/bash-specially-crafted-environment-variables-code-injection-attack/\nAn attacker can provide specially-crafted environment variables containing arbitrary commands that will be executed on vulnerable systems under certain conditions. The new issue has been  assigned CVE-2014-7169.\n\nA: You cannot circumvent authentication by exploiting this bug.\nBut SSH allows you to restrict what commands a user can run, e.g. by using ForceCommand in sshd_config. By exploiting this bug a user can circumvent this restriction and run any command she/he wants.\n\nA: The bug occurs when bash gets executed with a specially crafted environment variable.\nRemote exploitation over SSH is only possible when bash is executed. When the ForceCommand SSH option is in use, that command always gets executed using the login shell of the authenticated user (see the manual page of sshd_config).\nVulnerable configurations include public git services which normally restrict you to just running git commands. With this bug, you would be able to execute shell commands, bypassing the ForceCommand restriction. For a git daemon service, this could mean that you can access all repositories owned by the system user (bypassing access restrictions imposed by, say, gitolite).\n", "Q: Tomcat 7 not getting started from Eclipse I have Strucked with a annoying problem, I had installed eclipse EE for working under JSP & Servlets, I had installed WTS from Install New Software , I have installed tomcat7 from apt-get install tomcat7, now I want to integrate tomcat7 with eclipse, \nI have created a dynamic web project and when I try to Run the project as Run on Server, a window \"Run on Server\" comes up and asking me to select a server - \n\n\n*\n\n*Exsiting (which is already disabled)  \n\n*Manually --> in manually tomcat veriosn 3 to 8 are there, when I click on tomcat7 then server host name comes as localhost and servername is blank and does not allow me for next/finish button, when I click on tomcat8, server host name as localhost and servername as Tomcat v8.0 Server at localhost is coming,now this time next/finish button is enable, I click on next button, it ask me Specify the installation directory - I browse it and select the tomcat7 from /usr/share/applications/tomcat7 ,it is saying  The Apache Tomcat installation at this directory is version 7.0.52 (Ubuntu).

You have two options;\n1) Ensure that you have all the additional drivers installed on your laptop, you can do this by accessing system settings > Additional drivers.\n2) You can access your BIOS screen on boot up, and change the temperature at which the alarm will go off, or depending on your laptop series, you could also set the temperature at which the laptop should start spinning the fan or setting off the alarm.\nThe second part of the second step should be approached and executed with caution because then you may fry your laptop, so i would recommend setting the temperature at which it alarms or starts to spin the fan +1/2 degrees Celcius.\n\nA: I agree with the previous answer: the best thing to do is update your drivers.\nAbout changing the temperature settings via BIOS, verify on the cpu maker datasheet if you can safely run the processors at higher temp.\nIn addition to that, you showed that core0 and core1 are very close to the critical temp, so even with minor activities the fan kicks in. Verify that the area around this cpus is clean and that no dust is clogging the fan. This is normally the first cause for high temp.\nIf you built the computer yourself OR if you removed the fan/heatsink around that area, you may have a problem with the thermal compound. Get a good paste on the web (ph1, noctua, etc), remove old compound and apply new one.\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: How do you make printing use default settings every time you print?

See: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nFor the Dual Boot somebody else has to help.. Cheers\n\nA: Actually merely plugging in a USB memory stick or USB external hard drive permits you to use the usual Install Ubuntu options you would have with an external hard drive.  The catch is that if you do this while a pre-existing installation of windows is also mounted, the boot sector of that other drive will be altered such that the computer will not be bootable again unless the USB drive is connected to the computer.\nIn my personal experience with Unetbootin, while it is very useful, I have never seen it render a bootable memory stick which you would save files to the way one would with regular internal installations.\n", "Q: How do you install language support?

I.e. is the problem file-size related?\n\nA: it is a bug in many linux distros.I was using Linux Mint before now Ubuntu i have kept experiencing the same problem.But what you can do is to wait for sometime it will finish\nThe other solution is below.i tried it and it worked very well\nhttp://lonesysadmin.net/2013/12/22/better-linux-disk-caching-performance-vm-dirty_ratio/\n", "Q: How do I install MP3 codecs? I don't know much about computers. But a friend of mine installed Ubuntu 14.04 to try and I like it. But I can't play videos and music. Its says it needs MP3 codecs.  How can I get them?\n\nA: Open a terminal Ctrl+Alt+T. Then type the following command (or copy-paste it):\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nThis command will ask for your password. Note that when entering the password, you won't see anything printed in the terminal, neither letters, nor stars. Just enter it and hit Enter.\nAfterwards the restricted codecs should be installed. I wonder why your friend didn't install them during setup.\n", "Q: Wireless connection keeps dropping randomly on Dell Inspiron N5110 I have Ubuntu 14.04.1 installed on a Dell Inspiron N5110 laptop.\nI'm connecting to the internet through a wireless adapter, but when I'm connected I suddenly lose internet connection while I am still connected to the LAN and I have to disconnect and reconnect to regain internet connection.\nMy wireless adapter is  BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx\nApparently the b43 series has some problems with Ubuntu.\nThe link explains how to update your drivers for the WiFi card. \nI am writing from my phone so can't copy and paste all the details, but take care to use the commands specific for your version.\nI hope it helps\n", "Q: shellshock vulnerability and super user can shellshock vulnerability execute somehow commands with superuser permissions? \nAnd if yes, from where/how? \nIt is possible to be executed commands from cgi yes, but is it possible to get executed also as root?

You just need something that eats a environment variable, goes on to run bash, and is running as root.\nWill I give you an example? No. \n", "Q: Upgrading from ubuntu 12.10 I have a server running with Ubuntu 12.10. But now I am unable to update because I need to install update-manager-core which is not possible because my version is no longer supported.\nIs there a way to upgrade my server to a newer, supported version or should I let it running as it is (only web- and fileserver).\n\nA: 12.10 → 14.04 is not a supported release upgrade route. The only working route would be 12.10 → 13.04 → 13.10 → 14.04, I think. So you'd either have to perform three release upgrades, of which every one could break your system, or you start anew with 14.04.\nWhether you actually need to upgrade is up to you. If you don't want to install any too recent software and the newest features, I don't think you need the upgrade.\nHowever, there's still the security aspect. Ubuntu is a rather safe system (compared to Windows, where pretty much everything is safer), but rather safe doesn't mean absolutely safe. I can't predict how sensible the files on your server are or how you estimate the chance of an attack on your server, but no server is 100% safe. If your server is in an environment with a firewall-protected router, I'd say you're safe enough.\nSo, again, you have to tell whether you need the upgrade. But if you decide that you need it, the best way is a full reinstallation (Back up your data first!)\n\nA: My comment would be for this user, Peter Pötzi, to please try to stick to LTS versions in the future in order to avoid this problem.  As I recall, LTS versions are supported for five years, meaning that had he installed 12.04 instead of 12.10, he'd not be having this problem.\nI manage more Ubuntu installations than I care to count, some as some as old as version 8.10, which hasn't been updated in years and never goes online.  I'm currently keeping 12.04 as my primary system and will likely upgrade to 14.04 in a few months, but only after having tried it on alternative media first.\nI pretty much agree with everything expressed by the_Seppi above, (except maybe for the ambiguous comment which appears to suggest Windows might be safer than Ubuntu).\n", "Q: newest kernel not loading I got problem (maybe after automatic update - not sure) with loading ubuntu (14.04 lts) - it is now showing weird graphic during booting - something like this LINK and then black screen insted of login screen (but it would still play sound of login screen). When I start previous kernel from GRUB menu it boot normaly. \nAfter few tries to solve it I gave up and just purge that newest kernel thinking it is corupted, leaving that working one as newest + update GRUB.\nAfter reebot, that previously working kernel is doing the same thing as that deleted one - weird graphick and black login screen.\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: Is your hard disc partitioned such that you could install Ubuntu 14.04 again in a separate partition, in so doing making a clean install free of any clutter?\nDoes the same problem arise if you simply boot from a live CD?\nI have four partitions (sometimes more), and one is the current 14.04, the other is 12.04, there is a separate partition where I keep all my data files called 'Global Docs', and then there is the 'Swap file'. I update the Ubuntu installations in 'leapfrog' fashion; meaning that I shall overwrite the 12.04 partition with say, 16.04, when it emerges.\n", "Q: how to fix ubuntu overheating I'm new to Ubuntu but not to Linux and this is the first time overheating has been an issue for me. I'm using the latest version with all the updates installed and my computer has a Intel Core i5-3317U with the  integrated hd 4000  drivers installed from Intel's graphics installer but the computer still runs with temperatures in the 60 degree range making it quite unusable. The problem does not exist on OpenSuse, or windows 8. Any way to fix this heating issue?\n\\\nThanks. \n\nA: I noticed such issues in the past which is to be frankly honest not related to the OS itself but the support of the hardware to that OS\nfor example I had earlier an unsupported graphics card and after playing around with the configurations made the CPU doesn't sleep on idle thus making the fan spins all the time yet doesn't cool down especially when working in warm environment.\nBeing a thinkpad user didn't hurt much, but still its not a solution to have external pad that include fans to cool down your PC.\nMy recommendation is having full list of your hardware and comparing the support of each vendor and its drivers then if the problem still exists.\nLast experience also if your CPU configured to max out always and do not work on demand this could be a problem of overheating, look at Jupiter or similar apps that could help you achieve that\n\nA: Not so much an Ubuntu problem?  What I do with my PC's is limit the useage in the BIOS program.  During boot somewhere around the post page, you have to hit a particular key, such as delete to enter the BIOS program.  When in the BIOS program you have many choices, one is usually to limit the CPU run time useage.  I run my CPU's @ about 79%.  Find a useage that gets your CPU down to an acceptable temperature.\n", "Q: How do I write a CD/DVD from the shell to save emails etc? Was wondering if there is a simple way to save emails, etc... to a CD/DVD from terminal when the upgrade to ubuntuu 14.04 has delivered an icon and bar-less desktop with a program  error message?  Needless to say, I did not make a backup (not that I know how to).  The information is not that important, but would like to learn how to do a few things in Linux, other than getting stuck in log-in loops.\n\nA: Depending on what email software you are using, for example on my Thunderbird setup I copy the profile and rsync it from time to time to separate folder (with thunderbird is turned off) and then that folder I backup to external media when needed.\n\nA: Burning CD/DVD from terminal\nThe tool to burn a CD or DVD from the command line is growisofs. The man page shows only part of the options, because some are forwarded to a subcommand, that is used by growisofs: genisoimage\nFor example, of the command line to burn the home directory to a DVD (assuming it is not too large), growisofs -Z /dev/sr0 -r -J /home/username, the options -Z /dev/sr0 are documented in man growisofs, and -r -J /home/username are described in man genisoimage\nSee http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1089 for some examples.\n\nBackup of email\nIf you use IMAP to read mail, not POP3, there is a good chance that the mail is stored on the mail server, and you only have a copy. (IMAP keeps the mail on the server normally, but you can also move mail to a local folder)\nIf you use Thunderbird, your mails are stored in something like ~/.thunderbird/*.default usually, as part of the thunderbird profile.\nA backup of this contains account settings too.\nIf you want to backup independant of the format of thunderbird, there is the thunderbird addon \"ImportExportTools\" that can be used to export mails to single files, for example, to have a more flexible backup.\n", "Q: Unable to read HDD content Lubuntu 14.04 I had a pretty old computer laying around (Dell Dimension 1100) and last week, when I heard about ''Plex Media Center'' I tought it would be a perfect computer to install the server on it.

The security channels are fixes of the highest importance. The updates channels are for fixes that couldn't reach security, but still fixes of some sort. backports may contain bug fixes, but that is not their primary aim, and so it should not have anything in common with security or updates.\nAll packages go through proposed for testing before they reach security, updates or backports.

As part of this upgrade process, my version of Apache was also update from 2.2 to 2.4, which I understand is a significant change for some reason.\nSomewhere along the way Apache got messed up so I had to remove it and then reinstall.  Now that Apache has been reinstalled the problem I am having is that I cannot access http://localhost.  With a fresh install of Apache 2.4, I cannot get it to work.\nWhen I do sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart and sudo service apache2 restart these do not throw any errors, so I don't know what the problem could be.\nHow can I troubleshoot my new Apache installation?  Thanks.\n\nA: Having just encountered a similar problem myself, here are some steps...\n1.\nCheck whether apache is running (like you already did)\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThis command will attempt to (re)start apache, printing out status info while doing so. If you get an error here, that's your next clue to follow until you get apache running.\n2.\nWith apache running, watch its logs while attempting to visit one of your server's pages.\nsudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log /var/log/apache2/access.log\n\nThis command will print out the end (\"tail\") of the apache error and access logs, and it will \"live print\" new logs as they arrive.\nIf you see new error logs arriving while you attempt to visit one of your apache's webpages, then those are your next clues to follow.\nIf apache returns a response to your browser (ie: \"Forbidden\"), then that is one of your clues to follow.\nIf you see no new error logs or even no new access logs, then the problem is likely not with apache.\n3.\nIn my case, this lead me to the following places:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes#Ubuntu_Server\n\n*http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html\n\n*http://hussainweb.me/upgrading-apache-2-4-ubuntu-13-10-upgrade-stories/\nAnd I personally needed the following fixes:\n\n*\n\n*My vhost files (see /etc/apache2/sites-available/) needed to be suffixed with  .conf, as described in this stack-o answer.\n\n*I needed to have Require directives added to my vhosts, as described in the upgrade docs.\n\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu from within Windows XP on an old PC with no CD reader nor USB port?

I have no CD reader and I can't find the way to make my PC recognize the USB ports as \"bootable\" ports. Has anyone done this before? Thanks\n\nA: I believe if you mount the iso virtually with Daemon Tools or PowerISO and run it, you should get a screen with an option of \"Demo Installation.\" Try that it should get you to Live Mode.\n\nA: Have you tried your BIOS setup?  Also, sometimes the USB is listed under a sub-category of hard disk on the boot choice/device menu.  Phoenix and Nvidia  comes to mind.\n\nA: I think your problem may be the boot order of the BIOS.\nWhen the computer is booting, press F2 (or F12 or F8, depending on the maker).\nThat should open the BIOS menu. Select \"boot\" or \"boot order\" and set USB as first booting device.\nSave&Exit (normally F10 key) and now you should be able to boot from USB.\nIf you still can't boot, verify that your USB drive is working. Maybe test it on a different machine.\nIf nothing works, then the only option would be to take out the HDD and connect it on a machine with working USB ports and/or CD drive.\nI hope it helps.

In the past few years both myself and my friends have repeatedly found the 64bit versions of Ubuntu to be buggier so we tend to use 32bit Ubuntu even on certified 64bit computers.  You might wish to do the same.\nI've run into similar problems to the initramfs issue you describe when attempting to boot Ubuntu live CDs on old PCs with less than 384 megs of RAM.\nI personally suspect the real problem is that either the ISO file you downloaded was defective or that it was okay but it failed to write to the USB flash drive adequately.  In any case, purchasing a few extra 2gb flash drives and making extra copies with a variety of versions may prove handy in the future, at least it has for me.  To this day I carry a quaint old copy of Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook edition in my toolkit, not that I'll ever install it, but it's fun to run now and then and works on just about anything.\n\nA: If you are getting the message like,\nBusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu4) built-in shell (ash)\n\nEnter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

I didn't get an option to install alongside windows 8 so I went with \"something else\" option. I created the root and swap partitions and then installed ubuntu. Everything went fine while installation. But after rebooting it directly boots into ubuntu, it does not show the GRUB menu for choosing between ubuntu and windows. \nAfter using 'fixmbr' in the windows installation disc, I can now boot into windows but cannot boot to ubuntu. I deleted the linux partition and tried to the above again but I ended with the same problem.\nSo I was thinking if there was a solution like a command or something which could make GRUB identify the windows partition and give an option to boot to it.\n(if it may help, my windows is installed in legacy mode(as in BIOS mode).. if I disable legacy mode the laptop does not boot into any os and it asks for an EFI file to boot from. Also my liveusb boots only through UEFI mode. When I boot it in normal/BIOS mode it shows a blinking '_' )\nPlease help guys.. I need both the OSes for my projects. And I need them fast.\nThanx in advance..\n\nA: I really dont know a lot about Linux, but i fixed the same problem by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if grub is installed \ngrub-install --version\n\nor even\nsudo dd bs=512 count=1 if=/dev/sda 2>/dev/null | strings\n\n\n*If it is installed, probably he is not recognizing windows boot, so it directly boots into ubuntu and wont show the grub screen. So, if your windows boot file was not deleted, this should make grub appear and recognize windows as a boot option.\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nInsert # at the start of the line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.\nNow save then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should be fine to make Grub menu appears on every boot.\n( Grub menu won't show on dual Boot )\n\nA: As You said that after fixing mbr from windows you are directly booting to windows.\nYou should try \"Easy-BCD\" software for windows in which you can add the grub 2.0 which is favourable for Ubuntu as well as Linux and after adding the grub 2.0 in that software by selecting the Linux partition (obviously) you will have options for booting in Edit boot menu settings.\nChoose whatever You wish.\nHope this does fine for you.\n\nA: I was about to suggest boot-repair when I saw it had already been suggested.  Having opened that link I wish to add a word of caution; Please do not take the second option and \"install\" boot repair.  I've tried that.  It screwed up the installation beyond repair. \nInstead I would advice either using the first option or a heretofore not documented third option which is to use a utility such as unetbootin to make a bootable image of the boot-repair utility onto a USB flashdrive resulting in a self-booting boot repair tool. That's how I run boot-repair currently.  It's actually faster than CD, and as ever few computers made today even have optical media drives, having a self-booting boot-repair flash drive in my toolkit is just that much more practical.\nI currently carry two versions of boot-repair on flash media, one being a bulkier Ubuntu distro containing it, I think it is called \"rescue remix\" or something.  I like it because it includes important tools such as gparted.  I also carry a more stripped down version which appears to be based on Lubuntu.  It is handy when servicing older computers which have booting issues and simply cannot handle full-fledged Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Unique sorting: Redirect output to the same file Is there any short way to save the pipe output to the same file that it's processed. For example, this is what I am actually doing\n$ cat filename | sort | uniq > result\n$ rm -f filename\n$ mv result filename\n\nI was wondering if there was a way to do it in just one line (not appending those commands using &&)\nThis is not the way, but to get an idea\n$ cat filename | sort | uniq > filename\n\n\nA: Your suggested example (below) doesn't work because you'd actually be reading from and writing to the same file simultaneously.\n$ cat filename | sort | uniq > filename\n\nThe idea with a pipe or redirect is that the command on the left and right hand side of each pipe or redirect run simultaneously, in parallel.  The command on the right processes information as it is handed over to it from the command on the left, while the command on the left is still running.\nIn order for your scenario to work, the command that reads from the file would need to finish before the command that writes to the file begins.  In order for this to work you would need to redirect the output into a temporary location first, then once that's finished, send it from the temporary location back into the file.\nA better way to do this is basically like in your former example, where you redirect to a temporary file then rename that file back to the original (except that you don't need to delete the file first, because moving deletes any existing target).\n$ cat filename | sort | uniq > result\n$ mv -f result filename\n\nYou could also save it into a string variable, except that only works when data is small enough to all fit in memory at once.\n\nA: You can use the tee command:\nsort -u filename | tee filename > /dev/null\n\nThe tee command reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files.\n\nA: You can use sponge from moreutils package:\nLC_ALL=C sort -u filename | sponge filename\n\nYou also don't need pipe to uniq, since when sort has -u option to unique lines when sorting.\nNote that on GNU system with UTF-8 locales, sort -u or sort | uniq didn't give you unique lines, but the first from sequence of lines which sort the same in current locale.\n$ printf '%b\\n' '\\U2460' '\\U2461' | LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 sort | LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 uniq\n①\n\ngave you only ①. Changing locale to C force the sorting order based on the byte values:\n$ export LC_ALL=C\n$ printf '%b\\n' '\\U2460' '\\U2461' | LC_ALL=C sort | LC_ALL=C uniq\n①\n②\n\n\nA: You don't need any extra command like cat and uniq and also without using rm command and mv command to removing and renaming the filename. just use simple command.\nsort -u filename -o filename\n\n\n -u, --unique\n        with -c, check for strict ordering; without -c, output only  the\n        first of an equal run\n\n -o, --output=FILE\n        write result to FILE instead of standard output\n\nHow it work?\nsort command sorts your filename and with -u option, removes duplicate lines from it. then with -o option writes the output to the same file with in place method.\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nex -sc 'sort u|x' filename\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sort u sort unique\n\n*x write if changes have been made (they have) and quit\n", "Q: Okular is not listed in the open with option recently I installed Ocular .I opened file using Ocular through command window.But it is not listing in the normal user.But if I go for sudo nautilus , I am getting Ocular option.\nI know it is related to the permission problem for Ocular folder.Please give the exact location of Ocular for giving the permissions needed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open terminal(Crrl+Alt+T)\n\n*type sudo chmod a+rwx /path/to/file\n\n*Then press Enter\n\n*You will be asked for root password\n\n*enter the password.\n\n*press Enter\nNow you can access it as a normal file.\n", "Q: Recovering disk with corrupted superblock I am trying to recover a disk that has corrupted superblock but I cant seem to unmount the disk at all.

Re-installing ubuntu is an option since I didn't have any permanent data on it, but I do need it now for cross platform purposes. \n\nA: I would do as gyropyge suggested and try a boot-repair option first. It's possible that somehow your boot loader is not seeing the Ubuntu partition or loading it correctly.\nHere is a link to the boot-repair-disk project on sourceforge: boot-repair-disk\nAdditionally, I would also suggest that you look into virtualization.

It is there to help Windows do RAID as Windows cannot do full software RAID on it's own without some sort of hardware assistance. Linux on the other hand can do software RAID on it's own without any hardware assistance. Trying to use the \"RAID Assistance\" actually gets in the way and confuses the software RAID. It is generally recommended not to use this \"RAID Assistance\" when using Linux. (I learnt this one the hard way) As far as I can tell this \"RAID Assistance\" feature in BIOS's does not bring any performance advantage, it is merely a \"compatibility layer\" for Windows.\n\nA: I think the reason for the 4TB volume only being recognized as less than 4 TB is because storage is sold on base 10 and measured in base 2 and formating takes some space. A base 2 terabyte is 1024 gigabytes, a gigabyte is 1024 megabytes and so fourth. Storage is sold in base 10 teragytes, 1TB=1000GB, 1GB=1000MB, and so fourth.so a 4TB drive is 4 X 10^12 and the os sees that as 3.637978807 * ((2^10)^4) and some of the space will be used for swap and formatting.\n", "Q: Will \"Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr\" install and run without problems on my Dell Latitude D620 Laptop?

All my USB ports are in use (including the eSATA/USB combo port), with a keyboard, mouse, Logitech G430 Headset, and Lexar USB\nWhen in tty#/Ctrl+Alt+F# terminal, I get occasional (every 10 seconds) annoying messages with the line USB 1-1.6 device descriptor read/64, error -32.\nAnd I don't understand why. It only happens in TTYs, and I tried unplugging all my USB devices, yet the message continued, which makes me think it's a hub in my laptop causing the message.\nI don't experience any USB problems, and how can I prevent the message from coming up in the future  when in TTYs?\nThank you!\n\nA: Among the USB devices you have listed, I don't see a USB powered cooling fan.  I suspect your laptop is overheating.  If your laptop has been used long enough, which is some cases is as little as 6 months, it's heatsink might be so clogged with dust that a cooling pad might not make enough difference.\nWhen you get a chance please turn off and unplug your laptop.  Close it.  Turn it upside down and blow as hard as you can into the port where the hot are normally exits.  If you keep your eyes open you may be amazed by what you see.  This is typically one of the first things I do when examining a malfunctioning laptop.  I teach this \"trick\" to everyone I know.\n", "Q: Cooperative running of Ubuntu and Windows I have Windows 8.1 running on my laptop (i7, 16 GB RAM) and I am thinking about migrating to Ubuntu 14.04. However, I will still need Windows for years or even for ever as Windows is the working environment at my work and for most of my professional software (hydrology, GIS). What I would prefer is having both OS installed in dual boot. However, in daily use dual boot is not practical, as this needs regular switching between the two OS. In daily use I want to work with Ubuntu as my 'primary' OS, running Windows in a Virtualbox.\nNow my question is: is it possible to run the existing (and still separately accessible) Windows in a VirtualBox and if so, how to configure this?\nNote: @Rinzwind (see below) is right stating that my posting in a strict sense is not OS but VM related. However, in general my question is about how to enter de 'Linux world', at the same time being capable working under Windows inside Ubuntu. I am looking for useful suggestions.\nDespite the promising environment of Ubuntu, in number of users it is still far behind Windows and Mac OS. I think there are many people like me, who want to make a (gradual) change to Linux, but are tight to Windows in some way due to their work and/or profession. I think Ubuntu would attract more users if it could cooperate with Windows in a proper and flexible way and if clear support and instructions of how to reach that would be available.\n\nA: I run both dual-boot and VirtualBox VMs. So far as Windows 8 in a VM all I recall needing to do is specify either Windows 7 or Other Windows as the machine type when I set up the machine, and then I connected the .iso file from my Microsoft Volume license download to the CD drive. For resources I use 1-2 CPUs, 2G RAM, 25G HD. I had no problem. \nI have done this in VMWare and then VirtualBox with XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and now with the Windows 10 technical preview. The only problems have been Windows Server Essentials and Windows 10, which I had to work with substantially to get them to run even the install. If I recall correctly the key was telling VirtualBox to use Other Windows as the type. I also posted a YouTube video of the Windows 10 install, wherein you can see the VM setup on the first slide -- look for http://youtu.be/9EvPsa3YdAk This is extremely similar to Windows 8.1.\nHOWEVER, I also dual boot, because in some cases I simply cannot get the VM install of Windows to work well enough. For office software this is not a problem, but for  gaming I have had no success using a VM, so I dual boot just for those few cases. This will also let you use Windows as you are learning the ropes in Linux when you simply need to get something done and can't figure out how to make Linux do it.\nNow here is the key -- you must install the Windows FIRST, configure it, wait on all the updates, etc. then install the Linux. I do this every year on the 9 computers in my lab at Adult Life Training, and on my home desktop. I have never found a good way to install Microsoft after Linux is already installed, and also if you install the Microsoft first and let it do as much updating as possible before you install Linux, then you need not mess with the GRUB boot screen during all the Windows reboots from updating. After the Windows is installed then install the Linux on the other half of your drive.\nI hope this helps! If I can help further please feel free to email kubulai0@gmail.com or post here.\n\nA: Hints with conversion instructions here:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows\nand here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/721981/how-do-i-migrate-my-windows-desktop-to-a-virtualbox-vm\nhttps://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=51203\nVirtualbox is a good choice.

I reinstalled linux-sound-base and switched back to ALSA, restarted the computer with no success. I then removed alsa-base, pulseaudio and linux-sound-base altogether, and re-installed them. It broke my System Settings, but I was able to repair the damage using apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.\nOutput for aplay -l is: aplay: device_list:268: no soundcards found...\nWhen I open the Sound section in System Settings, the only output device listed is \"Dummy Output\", and none are listed under the \"Input\" tab.\nI'd like to know what my options are, aside from reinstalling the entire operating system. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I've carefully read the linked instructions and I cannot help but notice that down at the bottom it lists instructions for reversing its changes.  Your post doesn't appear to indicate you did that reversing.\nI submit that it would be helpful to you to either uninstall those packages installed using those linked instructions, or at the very least, determine if they are still installed.\nI'm no expert at this, but if you like doing stuff with command lines, you might try this one to see which OSS4 packages may still be installed.\ndpkg -l | grep -i oss4\nOtherwise I'd advise, as I so frequently advise, installing the Synaptic Package Manager, and either using its HISTORY (located under the file menu), or a search, to see which oss4 packages are currently installed on your system, and mark them for removal.  Considering how easy Synaptic makes this operation, I'm surprised it isn't mentioned more often.\nIn the end, you may still need to reinstall your entire system, but I'm sure that if you are ever going to succeed in the configuration of your recalcitrant sound device, you are first going to have to overcome its driver issues.\n\nA: As Alsa drivers now comes with the linux kernel , you can first try to run a normal software update:\nit will hopefully works except if your are already at last kernel version.   \nIn this case, try to force a kernel reinstall  successively copying and running this 4 commands in a terminal :  \nsudo apt-get clean -qq    \nsudo apt-get update   \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-`uname -r` \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-extra-`uname -r`\n\nThen reboot\n", "Q: Two display monitors instead of built-in display I have two monitors and my laptop's built-in display. However, my laptop has only a 15 inch screen, so I would like to use my two monitors instead of one monitor and my built-in display. \nI have connected both my monitors to my laptop's docking station, and they also display the desktop screen when I turn them on. The problem is, even though the two monitors display the desktop screen, I am only able to use one of them (i.e the mouse pointer does not extend to one of the screens). It is still one monitor and my built-in display. \nIf it is possible to use all the three screens, well and good. If not, how to turn off my built-in display and use my two monitors? \n\nA: Been there.  Done that.  Still have dust on the lid of the laptop.  I don't know if what worked for me will necessarily work for you, but it probably will if your laptop is configured similarly.\nAFTER MUCH fiddling with NVIDIA drivers and configuration screens, I discovered that my HP DV9000 laptop which I was initially given as a basket case broken laptop, was actually supposed to come with an IR wireless remote. I was able to purchase it on eBay which permitted me to turn it on while leaving the lid shut.  Unsurprisingly, HP designed these laptops to not power up their display when the lid is shut.\nProviding yours is similarly configured, you may be able to do this.  Alternatively, you may be able to configure your power settings to not put the laptop to sleep when the lid is shut, and it is possible that the internal screen will power down with the lid closed.\n", "Q: Xorg crashed and all apps killed after waking up from suspend? My computer wakes up from suspend.  I have to log-in twice to get to the desktop, just to find that everything is closed.\nSome processes are still visible in the Monitor though.\nI have a crash report with:\nExecutablePath\n/usr/bin/Xorg\nPackage\nxserver-xorg-core 2:1.15.1-0ubntu2.1\nProblem Type\nCrash\nTitle\nXorg crashed with SIGABRT\nproc.driver.nvidia.gpus.0\nError: Errno 21 is a directory /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0\n\nand so on....\nIs the Nvidia binary driver giving the problems again? Any way around it?\nIt's terrible because you just don't know if you will find your work killed or it will be fine (doesn't happen every time but like 1 out of 10)\n\nA: I had the error \nXorg crashed with signal 7\nError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0000:01:00.0'\n\nI found this was Bug #1763645 \"Xorg crashed with signal 7\", a duplicate of Bug #1760450 \"[nvidia] Xorg crashed with signal 7 in _dl_fixup() from _dl_runtime_resolve_xsavec() called from nvidia_drv.so\". \nWhat worked for me (driver 390) was in the comments:\nAdd scsi_mod.scan=sync to /etc/default/grub like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"scsi_mod.scan=sync\"\n\nNo resuming from suspend crashes yet. \n\nA: I used to have these problems, and then I simply accepted that it was less problematic to simply shut down my laptop instead of using features like sleep or suspend.  I think these features are more popular with Windows users because it boots up in what, a day and a half?  Then Windows the user grief when all they want to do is shut down and Windows insists on installing updates instead.  In my experience Ubuntu shuts down in 5-10 seconds on average, and boots nearly as fast.  \nAs for your NVIDIA driver complaints, I agree.  I installed drivers on this very installation when I was using an HP laptop, and now that I've moved onto a desktop WITH THE SAME INSTALLATION, I could not wait to purge all the NVIDIA drivers which I only recently accomplished.  My installation runs a lot better without them, but I'm not sure I'd blame the NVIDIA drivers for the suspend problems.\n", "Q: external monitor issue, when maximizing the screen opens on the laptop i have a fujitsu siemens with ubuntu 14.04 on it, the external screen is a lg 32''. my problem is that when i use the external screen and try to maximize the player to turn on full screen mode, the screen freezes and the fullscreen is relocated on my laptop's screen, anyone knows how can i solve this?\n\nA: My first thought is that the graphics chipset inside your laptop is simply not capable of displaying moving graphics full screen.  Many people have this problem with laptops which were designed for portability and energy-efficiency as opposed to high speed graphics performance.  When I use such a laptop, I have to choose between either running smaller videos or running them larger at a lower frame-rate.  \nIf you have reason to believe that your laptop is a model which was designed for high performance graphics such as gaming, please list its actual model and when I come back I'll attempt to identify the chipset you probably have.  It may just be a matter of installing the correct drivers for your chips.\nAttaching a larger monitor does nothing for slow graphics chips, and their is only a tiny minority of laptops which offer upgrade-able graphics components.  The only ones I've seen were made by Lenovo IBM and were hideously expensive.  It sounds to me like your best bet may be to acquire a marginally gaming-ready Desktop to go with your external Display.\n", "Q: cannot add swap with fallocate on EC2 I'm trying to setup the swap in /etc/rc.local this way:\nsudo fallocate -l 8192M /mnt/swapfile1\nsudo mkswap /mnt/swapfile1\nsudo swapon /mnt/swapfile1\n\nThis however returns an error:\nfallocate: /mnt/swapfile.sys: fallocate failed: Operation not supported\n\nmy partitions (EC2) are this:\nubuntu@ip-10-0-0-52:~$ df -h\n\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/xvda1      7.8G  2.8G  4.6G  38% /\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev            3.7G  8.0K  3.7G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           752M  204K  752M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            3.7G     0  3.7G   0% /run/shm\nnone            100M     0  100M   0% /run/user\n/dev/xvdb       414G   71M  393G   1% /mnt\n\nwith dd it works, but it's kinda slow, I wanted to make sure swap is present on boot.\n\nA: As of the Linux Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system call is supported by the btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs filesystems.\nYou can confirm which file system you have with this command (assuming the device name given above):\nfile -sL /dev/xvdb \n\nUnfortunately, it appears that in some cases the instance storage is provided formatted at ext3 instead of ext4.\nAssuming your instance storage is at /dev/svdb and you want to make a swap file at /mnt/swap that's 16GB in size (huge!), Putting this is /etc/rc.local will make that happen every time at boot.

If not then you should if possible do so because running processes initialised with the old hostname. If a reboot isn't feasible you could try reloading affected processes if you can identify them but I've not personally tried that approach.\nFinally, atop is a very useful tool for problem identification as it gives a comprehensive overview of the system, cpu, memory, network, drives etc. It often helps to narrow down the affected area and then you use a more specific tool if needed to zoom in on the problem.\n", "Q: How to selectively update my local ubuntu mirror Initially we have created a local ubuntu mirror and we update it manually as an when required.

NetworkManager is great for managing my wireless device, but I don't want it touching the virtual devices I create for network experiments (which I use with VMs or containers). I'd really like a way to tell NetworkManager to only manage wlan0 (for example), but the docs don't seem to indicate that's possible.\nHas anyone come up with a way to do this?\nAlternatively, is there a decent tool for managing wireless networks in Ubuntu that would behave this way? I'd prefer something a bit nicer than ifup/ifdown.\n\nA: Add your interface(-s) to /etc/network/interfaces . NetworkManager checks this file.\nSee also:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5321380/disable-network-manager-for-a-particular-interface\n", "Q: Console errors are not being shown The problem is no errors are being shown even when I type wrong command as shown.\nThere are several cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*bash> blablabla\n\n*bash> man blablabla\nThe output of lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2 gives the following:\nzsh     3565 username    0u   CHR  136,2      0t0    5 /dev/pts/2 \nzsh     3565 username    1u   CHR  136,2      0t0    5 /dev/pts/2\nzsh     3565 username    2w   CHR    1,3      0t0 1029 /dev/null\n\nI have managed to manually redirect commands output to console by prepending 2> /dev/pts/2 to each command, but still don't know how to make it global.     \n\nA: The exec command which is used for shell-level redirection in bash also works in zsh.

The title explains pretty much all I need to do.

My opinion would be that since you are using an LTS version, as am I, you should stick with what works until or unless you are sure you wish to upgrade.  As an LTS version 12.04 is supported for two and a half more years, and I have yet to be convinced there's anything I'll like more about 14.04.  Having said that, I do intend to install 14.04 fresh on another device in order to discover what's new.\nOn the off-chance you are actually requesting someone take responsibility for the success of your upgrade... I won't be that person.  There's risk in every upgrade, and even the most seasoned veteran will tell you to do a full backup first, at the very least.\n\nA: Yes, you should still go for the upgrade. You can always switch back to Gnome in case Unity is not properly supported by your graphics hardware.\nHere is the bug: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/UpdateManagerWarningForUnity3D\nAs it mentions, probably your hardware is outdated so you won't be able to use Unity to its full potential.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 login fails after lightdm/ xdm/ lightdm swap I am running kubuntu 14.04. \nRecently as part of a python development project changed the DM to xdm.

I suspect that after some updates your installation will be fine.\n\nA: Seems like interrupted upgrade.\nstartx wouldn't help in this case.\nIn root rescue shell try:\nmount -o remount,rw /\napt-get install -f\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen:\nexit\n\nBy the way, in rescue mode is possible to select \"dpkg\" to fix broken packages:\nhttp://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-not-booting-try-repairing-broken-packages-in-recovery-mode/\n\nA: I also had the same problem when I tried to upgrade to the 14.04LTS Trusty Tahr. The easiest way would be to get an installation cd for the 14.01 version and run it. Remove all the previous versions and install the 14.01 ,and after booting install all the available updates in update manager...and you should preferably create a backup of all the data in an external harddisk before starting the installation so that no data is lost.\n", "Q: unable to access drive I am new to the Ubuntu family, maybe a week, and already now I have got an error. \nThe error is that I cannot access my own drive which is named computer here. The images below explain the story.\nhow can I get back my rights ?\n\n\n\nA: /home is not your home folder, neither is /. These directories are intended to belong to root, and so it does on your system.\nYour home folder is inside /home, i.e. /home/yourusername. This subfolder belongs to you, but not its parent home. Nearly everything outside your home folder doesn't belong to you only to protect the system. If every user and every program had access to the whole file system, the system may break pretty fast.\nSo everything's fine, you're just searching at the wrong place. If you indeed need to access these directories (which you shouldn't as a mere user), start nautilus with gksudo nautilus to gain root access.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Upgrade, Perl Version Broke ZImbra Kind of in a bind here, since I heard about the bash bugs last night I decided on upgrading all off my server, not just the packages but the complete OS, it worked fine on all my servers, except my mail server, which was running Ubuntu 12.04 and I upgrade to 14.04. \nEverything seem running correctly but when I try to get the Zimbra service running I get the Following:\nPerl API version v5.14.0 of Socket does not match v5.18.0 at\n/usr/share/perl/5.18/XSLoader.pm line 92.

If the alternate mice don't work, then it's a driver issue.  If the alternate mice do work then it's a hardware issue.\nFor several years now I've been promoting Ubuntu to Windows users as a DIAGNOSTIC TOOL.  I suggest they boot their computer to an Ubuntu Live CD and that if it works right then their issues are with Windows, but if it doesn't work right then there are probably hardware issues.  Better than 9 out of 10 times, this litmus test works.\n\nA: In case your Touchpad doesn't work at all (No response from the Touchpad)\n\nThis is generally a case of a kernel (linux) or xorg bug.

But just out of curiosity:\nProgramatically ps has to be using C right? And in my use using the C functions is much faster, as I don't have to use popen to open and read.\nIn MacOSX/Darwin apparently they use something called proc_pidinfo and a topic on SO tells us how to do it here: Determine Process Info Programmatically in Darwin/OSX\nBut what about in Linux? I couldn't find a such thing as proc_pidinfo for us.\nThanks!\n\nA: According to multiple answers on stackoverflow, ps uses the proc file system through libproc to gather process information. It appears that this is the preferred way to do it, so I would think lstat(2) is the right way™ to find out the start time of a process.\n", "Q: Disable keyboard input wake up I want to disable making my laptop wakes up from suspend on keyboard input.

For one of the sites they will use additional hardware plugged into the laptop.\nIn Firefox they have the ability to visit sites(they will need the navigation bar) and use the plugins which are installed. They should not have access to the history, settings, printing or anything else.\n\nA: After a bit of further research, I came up with the mkiosk addon\nIt has an option to show the navigation bar, you can set an admin password and you can achieve \"no printing\" by not installing CUPS at all:\nsudo apt-get remove cups\n\nIn it's default setup, it has no admin password, so set up one. Also, you will need to change the home page to anything other than the default, in order to deny the access to the preferences, history etc. You can reach the mkiosk settings by hitting F1 on your keyboard and entering the admin password (the first time it does not have one).\nI tested the addon fullscreen mode and that seems to work well. Give it a try.\n\nA: You might want to take a look at Webconverger, which does what you want to achieve.

navigating in Unity.\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 and I have XBMC to start directly at login (the machine is used primarily as my media player), and to respawn when it crashes/is stopped (this explains how, if that matters). What I am unable to figure out is how to get access to the Unity desktop. Is there not a keyboard shortcut I can use or something?\nThere must be some way to do it, since if I attach a USB drive to the machine, for example, it mounts, I get a window popping up and THEN I can access the Unity panel, and I can alt+tab my way back and forth between XBMC and that window. But as soon as I close it, I cannot get back to accessing Unity panel (and its GUI functions).\nSo my question, more specifically, is if there is a way to put XBMC in the background or something so that I may access the Unity desktop. Or another good way around the problem.\n\nA: Thanks to @Smile4ever and the excessive key-pushing his suggestion induced in me, I found a solution: simply pressing AltGr made the trick! Then I suddenly enter the Unity GUI. Where it wants me to enter a command, admittedly, but that does not matter, since I can now access the desktop, minimise XBMC or do whatever I want.\nOne headache less for me -- having to insert an external disk in the machine every time I wanted to access the Unity GUI did not really strike me as the most sleek solution.\n", "Q: Apache 2.4 cannot proceed due to conflicts with Module mpm_prefork I have just updated from 12.04 to 14.04 and now have difficulty setting up Apache 2.4  I am getting the following error:\nSetting up apache2 (2.4.10-1+deb.sury.org~trusty+1) ...\nERROR: Module mpm_prefork is enabled - cannot proceed due to conflicts. It needs to be disabled first!\ndpkg: error processing package apache2 (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n apache2\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nHow can I disable the mpm_prefork so that Apache can continue?\n\nA: I would use the proper command to disable a mod in Apache:\nsudo a2dismod mpm_prefork\n\n\nA: You should try to remove the symlinks /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_prefork.{conf,load}:\nrm /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_prefork.{conf,load}\n\nThen relaunch the configuration of the apache2 package:\napt-get install -f\n\nOr:\napt-get install apache2\n\nBut more important, you should ask yourself how these were installed there before hand. You might have copied an older /etc/apache2 directory with these (for instance) before launching apt-get install apache2.\n\nA: There are apparently 3 different versions of this module (mpm_worker vs mpm_prefork vs mpm_event), and the error code can be misleading. Try disabling all three variants and then reinstalling. In my case (Mint 19.1/Ubuntu 18.04, php7.2), was the third:\nroot@machine:/var/www/html# sudo a2dismod mpm_worker\nModule mpm_worker already disabled\nroot@machine:/var/www/html# sudo a2dismod mpm_prework\nERROR: Module mpm_prework does not exist!\nroot@machine:/var/www/html# sudo a2dismod mpm_event\nModule mpm_event disabled.\n\nAfter this, installing the apache php mod worked (sudo a2enmod php7.2) and the code was executed correctly.\n", "Q: Will (un)installing packages on a liveUSB (Try Ubuntu) affect the installation?

How do I exclude mysql -u root -pPassword being picked up and stored by history?\n\nA: Put a space before your command.\nThis will work because, by default, the variable $HISTCONTROL contains ignoreboth which means ignorespace and ignoredups; ignorespace is what makes bash not save the command in history when there is a leading space.\nFrom man bash:\n  HISTCONTROL\n              A  colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list.  If the list of\n              values includes ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not saved in the history  list.\n              A  value  of  ignoredups  causes  lines  matching the previous history entry to not be saved.  A value of\n              ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups.  A value of erasedups causes all  previous  lines\n              matching  the  current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.  Any value not\n              in the above list is ignored.  If HISTCONTROL is unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines read\n              by  the  shell  parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value of HISTIGNORE.  The second and\n              subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless\n              of the value of HISTCONTROL.\n\n\nIf you want to exclude a certain command from Bash's history system wide, add the following to your /etc/bash.bashrc:\nHISTIGNORE='mysql*'\n\nThis will exclude any command that starts with mysql.\nExecute source /etc/bash.bashrc to apply the changes.\n\nSource: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/32460/excluding-some-of-the-commands-from-being-getting-stored-in-bash-history\n\n", "Q: Static IP Ubuntu Server on a VM I'm trying to install Ubuntu Server on a VM, but I need an IP which I can access, at least, from outside of the VM (my local network).\nI have tried the following tutorial unsuccessfully.\nRunning cat /etc/network/interfaces I got:\n(...)\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.250\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nEven if I restart the network, I can't reach the address from my computer.\n\nA: I did that often on a windows machine, but I know that Virtualbox on Windows is very close to the Ubuntu Version, so I think the options should be the same.\nIn order to access your VirtualBox from the outside you need to enable a bridged network under Network settings.\n\nAlso please enable remoting under display --> Remote Display\n\nAfter you did that you can access the machine.\n", "Q: using sed replace the new line with character I am using sed to remove the new line and replace with <br> but I am not able to get the desired output.\nI wrote:\nfind . -name $1 -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' -e 's|\\n|ABC|g'\n\n...but this doesn't work.\n\nA: Your sed expression is treating each line separately - so it doesn't actually read the newline character into the pattern buffer and hence can't replace it. If you just want to add <br> while retaining the actual newline as well, you can just use the end-of-line marker $ and do\nsed -i'' 's|$|<br>|' file\n\nNote that the empty backup file name - if you use it - must directly follow the -i like -i''; also the -e is not necessary when using a single expression.\nOTOH if you really want to replace actual newline characters, you need to jump through some extra hoops, for example\nsed -i'' -e :a -e '$!N;s/\\n/<br>/;ta' -e 'P;D' file\n\nor, more compactly\nsed -i'' ':a; $!N; s|\\n|<br>|; ta; P;D' file\n\nwhich read successive pairs of lines into the pattern buffer and then replace the intervening newline - see Famous Sed One-Liners Explained.\n\nA: If you want to  replace the new line and with <br>, you can use \n find . -name $1 -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/.*$/&<br\\>/'\n\n\nA: Why not just \nfind . -name $1 | xargs sed -ri \"s/$/<br>/\"\n?\n(Try without the i, first ;-) )\n\nA: To replace inline \\n with <br>, just use perl (or sed), needless to call find for that task:\nperl -pi -e \"s/$/<br>/\" myfile\n\nOr for an alias:\nalias brtag='perl -pi -e \"s/$/<br>/\" $1'\n\n", "Q: Password dialog doesn't work on lock screen 14.04 I have a two-monitors configuration.\nSometimes after a long period the passord dialog on lock screen doesn't work.

I have just changed the server settings to the server in my country. Since then, my Ubuntu updates have become very slow. Why is this? And how can I speed it up?\n\nA: I highly recommend that you use the source server marked as \"Main Server\". The connection speed to the local server would vary from country to country.\nAnother possible solution is to choose the \"Other\" option, then select \"Select Best Server\". This will make Ubuntu test the connection speed of all the servers and choose the best one.\nLastly, you can select a \"First World\" server given that they usually have better Internet connection speeds.\n\nA: you probably changed the location where APT is taking the sources from.\nyou can change your sources.list located here :  /etc/apt/sources.list\nan easier way is probably to change the software sources directly in UI of Software Center.\n\n\n*\n\n*open software center\n\n*click Edit on top and select software sources\n\n*select server where to take sources from\n\n", "Q: ufw not blocking traffic I have an apache2.4 webserver, and I am trying to block a malicious subnet using ufw.\n Here is the UFW setup:\n\n$ sudo ufw status verbose\nStatus: active\nLogging: on (low)\nDefault: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing)\nNew profiles: skip\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n80                         ALLOW IN    Anywhere\nAnywhere                   DENY IN     X.X.X.0/24\n\nI to test, I added a rule to block my own IP but I can still view the pages, and site, so evidently, UFW is not blocking traffic from my IP.

In my case though I'm seeing something really weird.\nUsually the error appears something like this:\n/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found\n\nMine looks like this though:\n/opt/smrtanalysis/current/analysis/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found\n\nA lot of the solutions (here, here, or here) suggest to try something like apt-get -f install to correct it (or reinstalling via apt-get), but I'm getting that error when I try to run apt.\nI've added /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, and /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH and still no go.\nEventually, I found a suggestion to try using dpkg --remove libstdc++6 and install it manually, which gave me this error:\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent removal of libstdc++6:\n...\ninsert long list of programs that depend on libstdc++6\n...\ndpkg: error processing libstdc++6 (--remove):\n dependency problems - not removing\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n libstdc++6\n\nSo I tried to reinstall from the .deb, thinking maybe it would rework the pathing issue, and I got:\nPreparing to replace libstdc++6 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 (using libstdc++6_4.6.3-1ubuntu5_amd64.deb) ...\nUnpacking replacement libstdc++6 ...\ndpkg: error processing libstdc++6 (--install):\n libstdc++6:amd64 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 cannot be configured because libstdc++6:i386 is in a different version (4.8.1-2ubuntu1~12.04)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n libstdc++6\n\nSo I gave up on that idea, instead I used locate libstdc++.so to make a new link to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.16 and copied it into /opt/smrtanalysis/current/analysis/lib/ to replace the incorrect libstdc++.so.6 link (saving the old one, jsut in case).

It uses a virtual solid disk (what you called 25GB VM), which is saved in a file on your real disk.\nThe Erase disk and install Ubuntu refers to your virtual disk, so your Mac OS will not be affected in any way. Ubuntu will be installed on this virtual disk and has no possibility to know what's going on on the \"outside\" - unless you use some interaction features, such as shared folders.\nThis is exactly the purpose of a virtual machine: To use any operating system without affecting the \"host\", the OS that's natively running on your computer.\n", "Q: Problems with Logitech HD Webcam C270 I am writing you concerning the webcam mentioned in subject above.\nI bought this webcam and tried to make it work with skype on a Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit system.\nUnfortunately there is a problem. When using it with skype, even though my conversation partner receives a proper picture of me, the picture of her sometimes doesn't work at all, sometimes I see her, but overlayed/intefered with a lots of blue \"shadows\" which makes the visual contact nearly impossible.\nThe problem could have something to do with the visual driver, may be, because when I try the webcam under skype --> Options --> video I receive a proper image of myself. Another thing is that I installed cheese, but there the cam doesn't appear at all, instead the program breaks down always.\nI haven't found a solution yet to the problem, which is the reason while I am asking for help.\n\nA: If Cheese doesn't work for you, try instead guvcview package. You can install it in a terminal emulator using this command: \nsudo apt-get install guvcview\n\nBut first you need to completely remove cheese package with this command:\nsudo apt-get purge cheese\n\nand after that reboot your PC and only after that install guvcview using the command line I mentioned before. \nGuvcview is not as gifted as Cheese but it will automatically adjust your webcam for performance instead of quality and you will have to manually adjust brightness, contrast and all that from Guvcview interface if you are not satisfied with them. Cheese bets on quality over performance and this is why some users go with Guvcview because they find Cheese to be too demanding for their specific hardware.\nAnd I think you should also install some video drivers for your graphic card. I believe your main problem is related to the fact that you forgot to upgrade your video drivers to the latest version available in Ubuntu repositories or as an aternative you can try installing video drivers available on the manufacturer's official website.

After I perform a full system upgrade and install all the drivers, I usually remove  Gvfs and all its dependencies and also Gigolo and any other piece of software used in Ubuntu to automatically mount NTFS or FAT partitions. Call me a paranoid, but I find it more reliable and secure this way to separate Windows files from Linux files mainly because of the incompatibility issues that may occur whenever I mix Linux with Windows.\nWhen and if I need to access a NTFS/FAT partition from Linux, I use the mount/umount commands in a terminal and all is fine this way. But my problem is that, though I can mount and entire NTFS/FAT partition, I am not able and I have no idea how to mount just one directory from a NTFS/FAT partition without having to mount the entire partition prior to that. I am not sure if this is even possible but if it is possible, please let me know how to do it.\nSo far I tried command lines like these:\n      sudo mount /dev/sda5/movies/Riddick/ /media/hdd/\n\n      sudo mount directory  /dev/sda5/movies/Riddick/ /media/hdd/\n\n      sudo mount /sda5/movies/Riddick/ /media/hdd/\n\nand nothing works. I can mount and read a partition, be it /dev/sda5/ or /dev/sda1/ but I can't mount just one directory from that partition. Any ideas?\n\nA: You can't directly mount a subdirectory of a partition without first mounting the partition.\nyou can not mount just a folder from a partition, if you want to mount a folder you will need to mount its partition first. or better if you want mount just a folder it will mount its partition automatically.\n\nA: /dev/sda5 and friends are partitions, a type of block device. They don't have (sub-)directories, but they can contain file systems. Only file systems can have directories. To open a file system use the mount command on the block device that contains the file system:\nsudo mount [block device] [mountpoint]\n\nwhere [block device] is the containing device (in your case apparently /dev/sda5) and [mountpoint] is an existing directory where the content of the file system will appear¹. On success you can then look for your movies in or below [mountpoint].\nIt is (generally) not possible to only mount a subdirectory of a file system on an otherwise unmounted block device. If this is what you want, an equivalent solution may be symbolic links or bind mounts.\n¹ shadowing the previously existing content of that directory.\n", "Q: No acces to applications I am trying Ubuntu and installed it in a Virtualbox under Windows 8.1.

I would go back to the download page of the distro you have selected and check the checksums I think it's called MD5. Most times before you burn the iso the burner shows you the checksums and you should check if they're the same number.\nIt could be a corrupt iso from a download.

I am running Xubuntu 64bit.\n\nA: I had the same problem while preparing to boot my raspberry pi. Therefore, I copied the Image- file (raspbian) via dd command on the SD- Card. However, I forgot one significant detail: Before using the above mentioned command I did not unmount the directory I wrote the files to (i. e. the directory of the SD- Card), so there was still a mount-point to the SD- directory while writing the image-file via dd command. As a consequence I received the same error-message when I tried opening the files on the SD- Card. Maybe the FAT32- partition is broken and your data is lost. Sorry to say, but I had to format my SD- Card, write the image file to the SD- Card again (before I did that I unmounted the directory to which I wrote) and as a consequence I could access the data and it worked out well.

Is there a problem with a compiled C binary having the name test?\n\nA: there is a bash program called test and when run it does nothing without arguments (do a quick man test in terminal to see more about it).  That is why renaming worked :)  \nLots of people do not know 'test' is a program too, best not to name scripts and such 'test'\n\nA: There is a shell program called test that tests conditions, which is why you couldn't run the binary. It is a shell built-in specified by POSIX that also exists in many other shells such as ksh (Korn shell) and ash (Almquist shell). Bash is made to (mostly) conform to the POSIX specification itself. The test utility is made to check for various attributes for a file or for various string and numeric tests. Examples:\ntest -e FILE  # if the file exists in some form\ntest -f FILE  # if the file exists as a regular file (not a directory, symlink, etc.)\n\ntest -n \"$str\"  # if the string has a length greater than 0\ntest -z \"$str\"  # if the string is an empty string\n\ntest \"$str\" = \"foo\"  # equivalent to `str == \"foo\"` in C\n\ntest $num -lt 10  # if the number is less than 10\ntest $num -ge 10  # if the number is greater than or equal to 10\ntest $num -eq 10  # if the number equals 10\n\nLong story short, it is probably in your best interest to rename your program instead of trying to run a file Bash refuses to even acknowledge the mere possibility of existence. ;-)\n", "Q: Dash and Panel don't load The top panel and Unity Dash dont apear.\nAslo Window Decoration donw apear (neither on top nor on left/right or bot) some windows are full screen all the time due to this, others in normal size (cant full screen)\n\nA: Try resetting Compiz, as there may be some problem with it.

The insert the reinstall disc of winXP and when it asks you which partition select the empty one(better remeber how big it was.) it should install. Also do quick format as FAT32.

I have a Intel i7 processor, 6g ram, and over 2.5t of disk space. I am loading the Gnome-Shell by DVD.  I am current using Windows XP because I cannot launch the Gnome gui.  \nI have three users on my computer, all of which are me.  Two are robert and geek.  Robert is the identity that does serious work.  Geek is the identity that plays.\nBeginning on or about 9/22/14, I started having trouble launching the gui for geek.  I logged in, used the correct password and the gui started to load.  After a considerable time, I would end up at the login page.  This has continued to happen since the 22nd.\nI could continue to successfully login with the robert identity, until just now.  Once in I could login geek on terminal.  Geek could then used the sudo process to act as root, etc.  I do not appear to have a login problem.\nI have also opened a tty at the login menu.  I then login successfully as geek.  I can use the tty as geek, including th sudo procedure.  What I cannot do is open the gui for geek.\nI have made various attempts to solve this problem using answers to related questions on this page and others.  In my last attempt, I logged in as robert, opened the terminal, and attempted to use the command startx, as indicated in the man pages to start the gui.  Now I cannot bring the gui up for robert either.\nIn the auth. log, I found that geek logged in, session started, then suddenly the session was closed by the system.  About the same time there were references to unsuccessfully attempt to connect an apparent X system file in /tmp to X system files in /etc. That may be the problem, but there is no further explanation in the log. I would attach the relevant portions the Auth. Log. but I can no longer access them.  I cannot see the log from Windows, and I cannot secure them as robert or geek.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I solve this problem?  How do I get the gui started once logged on?  How can I successfully start the gui from the terminal or tty?\n\n*How can I debug the effected process? How can I find where the processing is going wrong? \n\n*Is there a program I can run to search for and fix the errors?\n\n*What documentation should I consult, and where from, so I can figure out how to fix the problem?\nThanks\n\nA: if  you want to start a gui from the command line try the following:\n$ xinit\nit will open an xterm. Then in xterm type gnome-session. If it comes up looking like a scrambled egg, then it most certainly is a driver problem. If it doesnt work go back to your tty and press CTRL + C.

I've no idea why this works but a patient friend called me repeatedly so I was able to confirm that it was causing the problem.\n\nA: Ultimately, I suspect all you can do here is 1) report the bug 2) find a work around until the bug is (hopefully) fixed. \nFirst you have to make sure Clementine is definitely where the problem is. There are plenty of other music players to try.

Intel at the tie had an incompatible 64 bit servr chip ia64 itanium which flopped, so intel copied amd 64 extensions for x86.\nSo you should use ubuntu 14.04.01 64 even if there is an amd in the name.\nHave fun.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS under Parallels: Graphic Distortion after update Hardware:\n - Apple MacBook Pro RETINA 13\", Late 2013\n\nSOFTWARE:\n - OSX 10.9.5 (13F34)\n - Parallels Version 10.0.2 (27712)\n - Distributor ID:  Ubuntu\n              ° Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\n              ° Release:    14.04\n              ° Codename:   trusty\n\nWhen updating Ubuntu with Software Update, at some point some software is giving the unit video distortion. \nIt seems after a couple of rebuilds of Ubuntu and running Software Update, that the issue comes from:\nSoftware Update:\nUbuntu base\nXorg X server - core server\n\nTechnical description:\n\nChanges for xserver-xorg-core versions:\nInstalled version: 2:1.15.1-0ubuntu2\nAvailable version: 2:1.15.1-0ubuntu2.1\n\nVersion 2:1.15.1-0ubuntu2.1: \n\n  * Copy utopic package back to trusty.\n    - Fix ppc64el byte order.

I've picked Inkscape as a replacement of CorelDRAW on my Windows. It's free, so of course there have to be a few backdrops in face of its mighty ability to create perfect XML code for images. However, suppose I want to create a 10-paged documentary on Indian politics. Or anything. Now, how do I do it?\nMaking a folder and saving each page separately as an .svg file would be messy. So my question is this:\nHow can I, given that I can in the first place, make a multi-paged document with Inkscape? Even if the answer is \"No, you can't,\" please say so in an answer.\n\nA: If there are not many pages, try saving them as separate single page PDF files after editing with Inkscape and then merge using some tool like PDF fill. I do not know if it may lead to some problems later, but it worked for me when I tried with 3 PDF files.\n\nA: Today there is no native multi-page support in Inkscape due to limitations of the strictly implemented SVG specifications (multi-page support was only introduced in SVG 1.2. draft which was never released but dropped in favour of the upcoming SVG 2.0).\nTo overcome this an external plugin inkscape-pages provides multi-page support through generating a master page with links to subpages. However this plugin will not produce SVG 2.0 code for future compatibility. Nevertheless it will help creating multiple pages for later export to PDF (e.g. with the help of pdftk \n).\n\nA: I wrote a tool that generates a multi-page PDF from your Inkscape document;\nit uses the common trick of \"layers as pages\".  I call it ink2pdf, get it here: https://github.com/spook/ink2pdf .\nIt also allows conditional tags and custom layer-to-page mapping simply by how you name the layers.  Hope it helps!\n\nA: One trick is to make a huge page as tall as the number of pages you need in Inkscape. Make sure sections are equal in height, this can be done by copy/pasting a rectangle next to the page area for reference like shown in following screenshot:\n\nThen, you can export a .png with a high resolution as usual and use a poster creation tool, such as PosteRazor, which you can install with:\nsudo apt-get install posterazor\n\nStart it with this command (note the capital letters):\nPosteRazor\n\nFollow the instructions in PosteRazor. Some key points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set margins and overlaps to 0\n\n*Set the page size to custom and put the dimensions of your reference rectangle in Inkscape (units don't matter, it's only for scale)\n\n\nPosteRazor can be replaced with mupdf and other alternatives which you can find in this unix stackexchange question.\n", "Q: bash version does not change bash has been updated at least twice in the last two days, but the output of\nbash --version\n\ndid not change. Its first line keeps saying:\nGNU bash, version 4.3.11(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)\n\nIs that correct?\n\nA: Yes, it is correct.

To be precise, when you plug in a USB storage device, it is loaded in sd something, but where is a usb keyboard loaded in /dev/?\n\nA: Keyboards use event device files.

I am having some difficulty understanding what a script is. As far as I understand, it's a set of commands in  a shell. And what's the difference between a bash script and a shell script? can somebody explain this concept?\n\nA: from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script: \n\nA shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the [Unix] shell, a command line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.\n\nIn other words: a bash script is a shell script, but a shell script not necessarily a bash script.\nUnlike an application, a script is usually executed as a series of commands, from A to Z (although it can run in a loop). A script hardly takes any user input once it has started and is usually written to fulfill a single job.\nWhile modern applications usually are written in classes to fulfill a wider range of tasks, depending on what the user decides, a script mostly executes its commands from top to bottom, to exit once the job is done.\nThere are numerous scripting languages, of which bash is just one. To mention some which are used on Linux: python, bash, perl, awk, sed\n\nA: The classical difference between scripts and programs is that scripts are interpreted while programs are compiled and provided in exectuable form. \nThe definition is blurred today as you can compile scripts if you really want (eg: PHP compiled by Facebook) and modern programming languages use interpretation at lower levels (eg: Java with JVM, .NET and IL)\nShell scripts are scripts that use the Shell Command Language (sh). sh is a specification which has multiple implementations. bash started as a sh implementation but it grew to be quite different, though it supports a sh compatibility mode.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 on the same partition?

I always encrypt my Ubuntu installations.  Currently I have /boot installed on a flash drive and two encrypted partitions: / and swap.  In order to log in I have to enter pass phrases for both / and the swap partitions. Why does Ubuntu require a swap partition as opposed to a paging file like Windows?  When I first started to play around with Linux years ago, I vaguely remember installing Open Suse in Virtual Box and, unless I'm dreaming, I seem to remember Open Suse creating a paging file on /.  Is it possible to create a paging file on / under Ubuntu so's to avoid an additional partition?  \n\nA: I can't comment on a Paging file being to be created in Open Suse since I have no prior experience with it. However Swap is the paging partition for Linux.\nThe following is excerpted from SwapFaq (by Contributors to the Ubuntu documentation wiki):\n\nWhat is swap?\nSwap space is the area on a hard disk which is part of the Virtual\nMemory of your machine, which is a combination of accessible physical\nmemory (RAM) and the swap space. Swap space temporarily holds memory\npages that are inactive. Swap space is used when your system decides\nthat it needs physical memory for active processes and there is\ninsufficient unused physical memory available. If the system happens\nto need more memory resources or space, inactive pages in physical\nmemory are then moved to the swap space therefore freeing up that\nphysical memory for other uses. Note that the access time for swap is\nslower therefore do not consider it to be a complete replacement for\nthe physical memory. Swap space can be a dedicated swap partition\n(recommended), a swap file, or a combination of swap partitions and\nswap files.\nWhy do I need swap?\nMemory consuming programs Sometimes, a large program (like\nLibreOffice, Neverwinter Nights, or a video editor) make the entire\nsystem need extra memory. A significant number of the pages used by\nthese large programs during its startup may only be used for\ninitialization and then never used again. The system can swap out\nthose pages and free the memory for other programs or even for the\ndisk cache. In these cases, swap will be used to help the system\nhandle any extra load.\nHibernation (suspend-to-disk) The hibernation feature (suspend-to-disk) writes out the contents of RAM to the swap partition\nbefore turning off the machine. Therefore, your swap partition should\nbe at least as big as your RAM size. The hibernation implementation\ncurrently used in Ubuntu, swsusp, needs a swap or suspend partition.\nIt cannot use a swap file on an active file system.\nUnforeseeable Circumstances Unforeseeable events can and will happen (a program going crazy, some action needing much more space\nthan you thought, or any other unpredictable combination of events).\nIn these cases, swap can give you an extra delay to figure out what\nhappened, or to finish what you are working on.\nOptimizing memory usage Since mechanical hard drives are considerably slower than RAM (SSD - Solid State Drive - storage is not\nas slow as physical drives, but still slower than RAM), when you need\na file (be it a data file like a video, executables like Firefox, or\nlibraries), the Linux kernel reads the file into RAM and keeps it\nthere, so that the next time you need it, it is already in RAM and\ndata access is much faster. The portions of RAM that accelerate disk\nread are called \"cached memory.\" You will notice that they make a huge\ndifference in terms of responsiveness. The Linux kernel automatically\nmoves RAM reserved by programs--but not really used--into swap, so\nthat it can serve the better purpose of extending cached memory.\nOptimizing Swap performance Because swap space uses a disk device, this can cause performance issues in any system that uses swap space\nsignificantly because the system itself may also be using the same\ndisk device at the same time that it is required for swap operations.\nOne way to reduce this problem is to have swap space on a different\nphysical drive so that the competition for that resource is either\nreduced or eliminated.\n\nFor a more in-depth revision and understanding of all the components, feel free to check out the community Wiki: SwapFAQ\n", "Q: Putty, Byobu, Tmux and function keys I'm currently trying to use byobu from PuTTY via ssh.

I have folderA that has some files with a number sequence starting with a_000000. What I want to do is to delete files starting from a specific number: let's say a_000750 till the end of files in this folderA. Could anyone please advise how to do this using shell script?\n\nA: Assuming you know or can guess the end of the range, you could use brace expansions:\nrm a_{000750..000850}\n\nThe above will delete the 101 files between a_000750 and a_000850 inclusive (and complain about filenames that refer to non-existing files). If you have too many files for that, use find:\nfind . -name 'a_*' | while read file; do \n  [ \"${file#./a_}\" -gt 000749 ] && rm -v \"$file\" \ndone\n\nHere, the find simply lists all files matching a_*. The list is passed to a while loop where each file name is read into the variable $file. Then, using bash's string manipulation features, if the numerical part (find prints files as ./file, so ${file#./a_} prints the number only) is 000750 or greater, the file is deleted. The -v is just there so you can see what files were removed.\nNote that the above assumes sane file names. If your names can have spaces, newlines or other weird characters, use this instead:\nfind . -name 'a_*' -print0 | while IFS= read -rd '' file; do \n  [ \"${file#./a_}\" -gt 000749 ] && rm -v \"$file\" \ndone\n\n\nA: You could do something like this:\nfind . -regextype posix-extended -iregex './a_[0-9]{6}' -execdir bash -c '[[ ${1##./a_} > 000750 ]] && echo $1' \"removing: \" {} \\;\n\nOr:\nfind . -regextype posix-extended -iregex './a_[0-9]{6}' | sort | sed '0,/000750/d' | xargs echo\n\nThe first method assumes a fixed prefix, strips it off and checks the value.\nThe second method assumes a fixed-length suffix (and a common fixed prefix) and relies on that fact; and that, while 201 comes before 31 in lexicographically, it doesn't before 031.\nTest this out with the echo command, and once you're sure it lists the correct files, use rm instead.\n\nA: In Bash you can run:\nfor i in {1001..3000} ; do rm file_\"$i\".dat ; done\n\n\nA: POSIX shell solution\nterdon's first solution  relies on brace expansion, which is a property of bash and ksh, however it cannot be used in the standard /bin/sh shell, which on Ubuntu is symlinked to /bin/dash. \nIn cases where you have to rely /bin/sh for portability of your scripts, there's generally two ways to approach this. One would be via globbing. Just cd folderA and from there run rm a_*. The other way, would be to implement a C-style for loop alternative using while <CONDITION>;do ...done in shell language and format the numbers with printf:\n$ sh -c 'i=0;while [ $i -le 750 ]; do filename=$(printf \"a_%06d\" $i);echo \"$filename\";i=$((i+1)) ;done'\n\nNotice that here I use echo. Replace echo \"$filename\" with rm ./\"$filename\" or rm -- \"$filename\" when you're ready to delete the files. Also note, that this should be performed when you already cded into the desired directory.\n(ab)using awk\nAwk being a nice C-like language can help us in two ways: (1) we can generate filenames with for-loop and format them via sprintf function, and (2) delete said files via system() command, which will pass our generated filename and rm command to /bin/sh :\nawk 'BEGIN{for(i=0;i<=750;i++){filename=sprintf(\"a_%06d\",i);system(\"rm \"filename);} }'\n\nPerl\nContinuing with the idea of portable approach where we \"generate\" filenames, we can do same in Perl:\nperl -le 'for(0..750){$fd=sprintf(\"a_%06d\",$_);unlink($fd)}'\n\n\nA: As simple as \nrm partialfilename* -f\n\nIn your example it is\nrm a_00075* -f\n\n", "Q: Window contents corrupt when scrolling in Chrome and vim/gvim I am running 14.04 as a guest on a Win8.1 host (over VirtualBox 4.3.17), 3D acceleration is enabled.\nSince upgrading from 12.10 I have noticed that text/content will sometimes corrupt when I scroll a webpage in either Firefox or Chrome and in both terminal-only vim and gvim. \nIn vim it will happen that a text \"update\" (text inserted by tab completion or scrolled) will just not show, instead the background color is rendered. \nIn the browser case, scrolling leads to parts of the viewport showing a previous \"frame\" of the text, while others have updated to the current real location of the text in the viewport.\nIn both cases, a forced redraw of the app, by for example moving the window or taking a screenshot, will fix the view.

So I think as someone else commented this may be due to the version of gcc you are using.\n\nA: Try the following command:\n$ gnatmake hello.adb \n\n\nA: Simple answer, install the GNU-Ada-Compiler via the command below\nsudo apt-get install gnat\n\n\nA: I've been having a similar problem with compiling ada. \nI think the problem is that your computer is using your old gcc, instead of the ada-aware gcc included in gnat.\nIf you install gnat from adacore, you will get a binary folder which you add to path.\nI don't know about what the ubuntu GNAT package does, but you'll have the binaries somewhere in your system.\nYou can reorder your PATH to place the GNAT gcc earlier. Or you can explicitly call the location of the gnat gcc.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Trusty can't update bash I'm trying to upgrade bash to the latest version to fix the bash vulnerability, but my machine can't seem to find the new package to install.

These laptops should gain read access to the primary database.  The primary database is on my \"server\" which is one of the Ubuntu machines.  \nI'm going from one problem to the next and can't seem to get it right.  Help would be greatly appreciated.  \nHere are the requirements:\n-The database that I want to share/edit is located at /home/valleysecurity/Documents/Shared/\non one of the Ubuntu machines, which I will call \"server.\" There are folders and files in that folder.All other Ubuntu machines I will call \"client.\"\n- On all Ubuntu computers there are the same users, admin, valleysecurity, and technicalsupport.  Each user has the same SID and password on each computer.\n- Only those users can edit/change/modify files and folders.\n- When a new document or folder is created, it should have the same security attributes as the rest of the folder hierarchy:  user = {whoeverCreatedit}, group = valleygatehouse.\n- all three users are defined in a group \"valleygatehouse\".\n- all the computers are in a workgroup called \"valleygatehouse\"\nCurrent Problem:  \nFrom a client, I can see the valleygatehouse group, but, when I click on the group, I get challenged for a password.  The challenge has already filled in the userid, which is whatever user I am at the moment.  It will not accept the password and continues to ask for the password.  How do I fix this?\nNote:  I am very confused about whether to use the built-in functions of Nautilus, the Samba user interface, or to edit the .conf file or whatever.  It seems they work at cross purposes.  Plus, the \"current\" documentation is all over the place in terms of naming conventions; eg, smbusers vs users to contain the users, and whether or not this file should contain all the users plus some other stuff or just one user???? Arghh!\nPS.  I can remove this problem by using Nautilus to change all folders to allow guests for Samba and to allow RW for \"others.\"  But that defeats a security requirement.

I guess that is the reason that I have\nmultiple encodings in the text file, but I am not sure.  How can I\navoid creating a text file with mixed encodings by copying its\ndifferent parts from different sources into gedit?\n\n*Whenever I open the file in gedit, gedit can always show or decode\nevery part of the text correctly. It seems that gedit can handle a\ntext file with mixed encodings, but I am not sure.\nBut when I open the file in emacs, there will be characters that\ncan't be shown correctly. (I am not sure why emacs can't do that.)\nSo I would like to convert the file from mixed encodings to a single\nencoding such as utf-8.\nSince I think gedit can detect the correct encodings for different parts of the text file, and I don't know if there are other applications that can do so, would it be possible to ask gedit to convert the file to\nutf-8, or at least tell me what encoding it finds for which part of the file? \nThanks.\n\nA: Hmmm... the concept of a file with various encoding is somewhat wobbly, to be honest. If you have a bit of time, this article (and this one) are worth reading.\nFor Linux a file is a sequence of bytes. If you ask a program to interpret it as a text file, it will do it using a mapping between bytes and characters; this mapping is the encoding. Almost all the text editor I know (not word processors!) just understand the concept of one encoding for one file.  \nI am not expert on gedit; maybe it is doing some magic like trying to autodetect the encoding line by line or text block by text block... if it is the case you can try to do the same using enca(1): \n while read line; do echo $line | enconv -L none -x utf8; done < text.mixed > text.utf8\n\n...but it depends on how good is enca in guessing you encoding (works almost well with Eastern European, but not with Latin1, for example).\n(1) It's in the repos, just install it with sudo apt-get enca.   \n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it with Emacs. The solution is quoted from here:\n\nAnother possible solution is to mark each region appearing with Chinese characters and recode it with M-x recode-region, giving \"Text was really in\" as utf-16-le and \"But was interpreted as\" as utf-16-be.\n\nAnother one is to split the two parts which have different encodings, copy them into different files, convert the encoding of the one and add it to the other. In my case this worked with Atom, but not with Notepad++ (utf16-le/be).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installation \"Permission Denied\" First of all, I tried to download the .iso file and burnt it on a DVD, but the setup didn't show up.

I just saw a report on Facebook about 14.04 having a security issue related to nginx. I followed the link and update instructions, but how do I find out which version I have on my machine to see if it worked?\n\nA: The only recent (past 10 days) vulnerability of nginx I can find on the Ubuntu security notices is CVE-2014-3616. Version 1.4.6-1ubuntu3.1 contains the fix for that CVE. Check with:\n$ apt-cache policy nginx-core\nnginx-core:\n  Installed: 1.4.6-1ubuntu3.1\n  Candidate: 1.4.6-1ubuntu3.1\n\n(All the nginx packages should be upgraded together, but you can check the status of each package individually as well.)\n", "Q: Cannot add an application to the launcher I've downloaded Eclipse and I want it to be on my fast-launching dash bar but the problem is that, as you all probably know, Eclipse does not install but is inside a normal archive.\nSo I tried to make my own .desktop file and placed it in ~/.local/share/applications but it didn't change anything.\nSo I downloaded alacarte and tried to add a menu element but every time I hit the \"OK\" button nothing happened (there wasn't anything new on the alacarte list, of course nor on the dash bar).\nSo what should I do and why nothing I've been doing seemed to work?\nMine .desktop file:\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse\\ Java\nComment=Eclipse\\ Luna\\ do\\ pracy\\ przy\\ Javie\nExec=./~/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse\\ Java/eclipse/eclipse\nIcon=./~/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse\\ Java/eclipse/icon.xpm\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n And the alacartes one:\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nComment=Eclipse Luna dla Javy\nTerminal=false\nName=Eclipse Java\nExec=/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse Java/eclipse/eclipse\nType=Application\nIcon=/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse Java/eclipse/icon\n\n\nA: Issues with the desktop file\nTaking the alacarte-made desktop file as a starting point (the other one has more issues), there are two lines which are almost certainly critical, and causing your desktop file to be refused by Dash and the Launcher:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Exec= line:\nExec=/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse Java/eclipse/eclipse\n\nWhat you are actually trying to do here is to open a file Java/eclipse/eclipse with an executable called Eclipse, located in /home/jantek/Instalki:\nExec=<application> <file>\n\nThat is probably not what you intended. Instead of the application (eclipse), you are referring to what seems to be a directory (Exec=/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse). \nAssuming the executable eclipse (lowercase) is in the folder .../Eclipse (looking at your Icon= line, but check it), your Exec= line simply should be like:\nExec=/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse/eclipse\n\n\n*The Icon= line:\nLike I mentioned in my comment, Alacarte removes the file extension of any icon you define. Apart from that, just like in the Exec= line, the path you are defining is incorrect (why the space?). Your Icon= line should look like:\nIcon=/home/jantek/Instalki/Eclipse/icon.xpm\n\nBut again, check if the paths to both the eclipse executable and the icon are correct.\nIf you fix these two lines, your .desktop file should work fine.\nNote:\nIf the path to your executable or your icon includes foldernames with spaces:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is in the Exec= line, put either the whole part after Exec= in quotes:\nExec=\"/long/path/to/executable/folder with spaces/eclipse\"\n\nor just the folder with spaces:\nExec=/long/path/to/executable/\"folder with spaces\"/eclipse\n\n\n*In the Icon= line, a folder with a space should be fine:\nIcon=/long/path/to/executable/folder with spaces/icon.xpm\n\n", "Q: Missing Login screen (kdm missing? plasma5) I installed plasma5 on 14.10 and had bunch of problems.

I have been trying to install gnome3 to my ubuntu. And a had a partial success. At some point of installation, I came to an error, which I don't have any luck of solving, and I have searched for hours.

I've not knowingly changed anything, but all of a sudden none of the icons in system settings are showing.

If you didn't modify it (or used one of the other options instead of manual partitioning), you will likely have GRUB installed in /dev/sda, and if you choose to use it for GRUB the next time when you install Ubuntu, the olde GRUB will be overwritten. So you should be safe.\n", "Q: Importing shortkeys from windows I want to install Ubuntu on my parents' PC to provide them a better performance of their old PC. Is there an easy way to import all the basic shortkeys they had in windows?\n\nA: Windows keymap could be part of copyright, so I wouldn't expect this to be readily available. However, in System-Settings -> Keyboard there is Shortcuts tab, which you may wanna play around with. Language input shortcuts can be edited through System-Settings -> Text Entry.\nAsk your parents which shortcuts and keys they use the most, and also make necessary changes as they learn Ubuntu, because there are going to be keys users remember only when they need to use them. Most frequently used, Ctrl+C  for copying and Ctrl+V for pasting are obviously there. Windows Key + W brings up all the open menus to select from. Ctrl+Shitf+Left-Right arrow keys position a window on half the screen , just like in windows 7 . Probably good idea is to disable workspaces in System Settings -> Appearance -> Behavior. New users get confused easily with this stuff (just watch some of the videos of people trying Ubuntu for first time on youtube). \nTell them simply which program is internet, which program is word processor. Keep things simple. At least in my mother's case, I just told her which program is which, had to let her play around with the laptop by herself, and she's slowly learning. \n", "Q: Degraded performance in boot after installing the Gnome Desktop I installed Ubuntu 14.04 via a minimal CD. it looked like a terminal window so I did: apt-get install gnome and it downloaded a lot of stuff.

It doesn't do that because the guest shouldn't be the one to control the wireless adapter of the host, in an idea setup.  As the Windows 7 host which is running VirtualBox accesses the wireless adapter, the network adapter on the guest OS (in this case, Ubuntu) is virtual and does not control your wireless adapter.  Essentially, unless you're running an oddball configuration, VirtualBox runs everything that it runs as guests through virtual network adapters which eventually go out through the active network connection on the host OS.  That's effectively like this:\n\nSome explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the VirtualBox guest VMs in a typical setup go through the VBox network interfaces.  To that end, you can have multiple virtual interfaces on a guest which then in turn each access a different virtual network interface.  This can be used to have a firewall or gateway box between some VMs and the host OS adapter on the way out to the internet.\n\n*VirtualBox Virtual Network Interfaces are essentially network adapters that exist virtually.  They don't physically exist, but exist as part of VBox.  Each VBox interface typically has its own subnet of addresses, and they typically don't communicate between each other, except in advanced setups.  These are exposed to the Virtual Machines, when the VM is set up to have a network interface connected to one of these virtual network interfaces.  The host hardware is not exposed/shown to the guest OSes as a result, only these virtual interfaces.\n\n*VBox Bridged is connected (virtually, aka 'bridged') to one individual interface and your guest effectively has access to the hardware interface that is hooked up to the Bridged connection and can use that network interface as if it were its own and a separate connection, so rather than an internal IP address.  This does not, however, disclose the type of 'host' network interface in use, whether ethernet or wifi, so it just appears as an 'ethernet connection' to the guest OS, because it still goes through a virtual network interface.\n\n*VBox NAT runs your data through one or more active host OS Network interfaces.  To that end, your guest OS gets a private internal IP address that works only within the VirtualBox network.  You can then specify port forwarding rules (NAT rules) which can allow for your computer and a specific port to be reached and then forwarded to the internal guest OS.\n\n*VBox Virtual Network indicates a virtual network adapter which can be its own segregated network.  Typically you can use this to isolate internal networks, or you can run a VM as a 'gateway' (or 'firewall', such as a pfSense instance), and then use the Virtual Network as all the guest OSes that run through that virtual 'gateway'.  This is advanced though.  (Most simple VM setups will just use the NAT or Bridged setups)\n\n\n*\n\n*Typically, these network interfaces aren't set up to go right to the hardware on the host, but you can create multiple \"bridged\" connections in theory and each virtual network adapter would then be bridged differently with a different hardware interface on the host OS, but that's an atypical setup.\n\n\n\n\nNote that an alternative way to get a wifi adapter onto the guest VM is to get an external USB wifi adapter, and connect it to the VM via USB Passthrough, but that can be tricky and painful to configure at times in some hosts, and varies a little from host-to-host (which is why I do not detail it here).\n", "Q: apt-get update not working guys please help me unable to apt-get update \nthe output is\n20% [9 InRelease gpgv 23.4 kB] [7 Sources 76.5 kB/1,064 kB 7%] [Waiting for heaSplitting up /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/www.plexapp.com_repo_dists_lucid_InReleasIgn hp://ww.plexapp.com lucid InRelease                                     \nE: GPG error: http://www.plexapp.com lucid InRelease: Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA' (does the network require authentication?)\ndraguve@Patil-Server:~$ \n\nFull Output :\nhttps://justpaste.it/hajh\n\nA: Your Plex repository entry is outdated.

The SSD is the only storage drive I have installed.\nAs I previously mentioned, I am new to Ubuntu - I am now looking for some guidance and help in order to get the dual-boot working.\nI own a HP Pavilion dv6500 laptop, with 4GB RAM installed.\nI will be using Windows primarily, Ubuntu is going to be a learning experience only, but I intend to keep it installed and use it more in future.\nI don't know how to set the partitions properly, this is where I need your help. I have been reading many topics, posts and articles about this but I couldn't find an SSD-only, specific, step-by-step instruction. The ones I found were SSD and HDD related and I got confused. My apologies.\nI am currently waiting for Ubuntu media (DVD and USB key) from a OSDisc.com delivery. I only have the Windows installation disc with me.\nCan I install Windows while I wait for the Ubuntu delivery? Do I need to do anything on the SSD before the Windows installation? Do I need to do a Custom Windows installation and set the partitions from the initial wizard? If so, can you tell me, more or less, the different partitions I need to create? The SSD is brand new, I only installed Windows for testing but I can do it again.\nPlease, let me know if you require additional information from me.\nAny help will be much appreciated.\nThank you very much in advance.\nPS: I don't play games on my laptop.\n\nA: If you're going to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 then there is no need to wait for Ubuntu. You can go ahead and install Windows 7 on the hard drive and when you install Ubuntu 14.04 make sure you choose 'Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7' and at that point you can set the size of the Linux partition. \n", "Q: Can I use cd../.. as an alias name? I am using Windows and Ubuntu in parallel and do console stuff on both of them.\nOn Windows I can do a\nC:\\Users\\Thomas>cd..\\..\nC:\\>\n\nHowever, on Linux this does not work, neither with backslashes nor with forward slashes.\n21:17:10 $ cd../..\nbash: cd../..: No such file or directory\n\nSince I often make that mistake, I have tried to define an alias in .bash_aliases for that situation:\nalias cd../..='cd ../..'\nalias cd..\\..='cd ../..'\n\nWhen I start a new bash, I get\n21:16:26 $ bash\nbash: alias: `cd../..': invalid alias name\n\nHow would I set up aliases for cd..\\.. and cd../.. correctly?\nThe cd..\\.. seems to have problems with the escape character:\n21:39:43 $ cd..\\..\nbash: cd....: command not found\n\nIt does not work, even if I define another alias for cd.....\n\nA: \"You can't use slashes in an alias or function name\"? That's news to me. I've been using the following shell function for years on Linux and OS X bash, and never had any trouble:\nfunction ../.. { cd ../..; echo \"$PWD\"; }\n\nNaturally, cd../.. is a fine function name as well. A slash can be used in a shell function name. \nAs for the backslash version, you can't embed it in an alias or function name but you don't have to: When you type cd..\\.., bash interprets the backslash as an escape and tries to execute the resulting cd..... So define that and you can do everything you were after. You are welcome.\nfunction cd.... { cd ../..; } \n\n\nA: If you want to keep the aliases, why not just do:\nalias   ..='cd ..'\nalias  ...='cd ../../' \nalias ....='cd ../../../'\n\nOr, if you need to go way back:\nalias   .3='cd ../../../' \nalias   .4='cd ../../../../'\nalias   .5='cd ../../../../../'\n# how far back do you need to go on a normal basis..?\n\nNo idea how well that helps you keep mentally in sync with your Windows brain, but this still seems like a simple way to go.  (At least for those of us lucky enough to not need to worry about how things are done on Windows.)\n\nA: You can't use slashes in an alias name. Bash allows them in function names, however, so you can make that a function:\ncd../.. () { cd ../..; }\n\nYou can't use backslashes in an alias or function name. The backslash character quotes the next character, so cd..\\.. is parsed as cd...., well before that string is looked up as a command name. If you want to call a command named cd..\\.., you need to type cd..\\\\.., 'cd..\\..', or something equivalent. Furthermore, a command name which was quoted in any way isn't considered for alias lookup, so you can't ever use an alias name containing a backslash. Bash doesn't allow backslashes in function names, either. Since cd..\\.. is parsed as cd...., you can define a function called cd.... (as above).\nIf you use the cd command, you'll have to type the space after it, just like any other command. But you can save typing by not typing cd at all. Set the autocd option with the following line in ~/.bashrc:\nshopt -s autocd\n\nThen you can type a directory name on the command line, and “executing” that directory will change to it.\n~/some/sub/directory$ ../..\n~/some$ \n\n\nA: / and \\ are among the characters which cannot appear in a Bash alias name. From man bash:\n\nThe characters /, $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name.\n\nAs a workaround, you can switch to Zsh, which allows both:\n% grep 'alias.*cd' .zshrc \nalias cd../..='cd ../..'\nalias cd..\\\\..='cd ../..'\n% pwd\n/Users/firas\n% cd../..\n% pwd\n/ \n% cd\n% pwd\n/Users/firas\n% cd..\\..\n% pwd\n/\n\n", "Q: Computer not suspending when inactive in the main log-in prompt My computer is set to automatically dim the screen and lock after 10 minutes, and suspend after an hour of inactivity.\nThat works fine - but only once I've logged in.\nIf I switch the computer on and then leave it, it won't suspend, although it will dim the screen.\nWhy does this happen, and is it a bug?\nRelevant information:\n\n\n*\n\n*desktop computer\n\n*mobo: M5A97 EVO R2.0\n\n*proc: AMD FX-8320\n\n*graphics: AMD Radeon HD 7790\n\n\nFiled a bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1377820.\n\nA: Solution\n\n\n*\n\n*Install powernap. You can find it through Ubuntu Software Center or do sudo apt-get install powernap . \n\n*Enter terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and navigate to /etc/powernap (cd /etc/powernap). There you should find config file. Open it with the text editor of your choice. For me it's nano. sudo nano config. Or you can edit it directly as soon as you open command line - sudo nano /ect/powernap/config. \n\n*Find this portion of the file:\n\nThis is the copy of my edited config file. I've already set this to 1 (which is suspend). By default it is set to 0 (powersave). This setting will make computer suspend if all the things that powernap monitors are idle, in particular keyboard.\n\n*Bellow this portion of the config file, find next portion:\n\nAgain, this is copy of my already edited file. I've set ABSENT_SECONDS to 1800, because 1800 seconds is 30 minutes. Set this to your desired number of minutes. Save and close the file.\n\n*Navigate to /etc/default and locate powernap file.

By default START=no, so set it to yes. \n\n*Reboot to let all the changes take effect. \nOnce the login shows up, see it puts your computer to sleep without loging in. \nWhat I've found during research\nApparently, before Ubuntu 11 or 12.04, there used to be an app called gnome-power-manager, and there existed some solutions to this problem but this app is now depreciated. This bug , particularly for lightdm desktop, has been reported many times, but I've found no simple solution listed anywhere. I've also found that there are some ways to make gdm greeter/login screen to suspend when no one is logged in. Obviously, some people may be stubborn and stick with the default unity greeter, so this solution should work for everyone, regardless of the greeter used (I personally use gdm and unity, interchangeably).  I'm sure there are work around to this through bash scripting , but at least I couldn't find it. \nMy understanding is that you wanted automatic suspend when no user is logged in after some period of time, which this answer has achieved, at least on my machine. There's somewhat another option. Once your log in screen appears, go to tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1), login through there, and type sudo shutdown -P +30, which will shut down computer after 30 minutes, if no-one logs in. Downside of this , is that you have to cancel it once you get back to the machine, and if you forget, it will shut you down in the middle of work.\nLet me know if this help. Cheers !\n(PS: Dear moderators, please help me edit this answer, because when I posted text copies of the config file, the # signs would make all text bold, so I had to use pictures. If it's not to hard for you, please edit my answer, so that it also contains text copy of all the config files.

Still I got a \"window\" - pop-alert with message: \"No such interface 'org.gtk.vfs.Mount' on object at path /org/gtk/vfs/mount/1.\" After plug cable (USB in computer - charging slot in mobile) I was asked by mobile what kind of connection via USB I want to have. There was 3 options: transferring pictures, transferring files, and charging.\nI went to settings of USB transfer and got 4. option: \"Device is a source of MIDI signal\". Pick 4th option, and back picked \"transfer of files\". It has helped.\nIf I could speculate what was the problem, I don't know without some developing tools and time for it. I think it was some not clear setting in my mobile, made by applications in Android which, in short, made some fault connection. If not - only things comes to my mind is that it was some sort of spy app by any app I had on my mobile, and I got rid of, just before to make such steps I just wrote. I hope it was not.  Ah, then there were some settings I made while I was trying to figure this out (permissions for apps ect.

The computer (a desktop) boots at a normal speed, but OS usage is slow. When using Ubuntu, all animations are slow. It can take several long seconds to open/close processes.

Thank you.\n\nA: You weren't particularly clear on your hardware setup, but a P4 with a GeForce2 (I think that's what the NV32 means here) is a thirteen year-old computer system. First of all, while that's officially above the minimum specs for Ubuntu, it's terribly slow compared even to a 2007 computer. You need to accept that fact.\nThe graphics card is quite old, and unsupported by NVidia. Your slow graphics are probably due to an accelerated driver not being installed. I think you can install the nvidia-96 driver to get acceleration, but you still shouldn't expect something wonderfully snappy.\nHonestly, your system is more appropriate for Lubuntu (or maybe Xubuntu or Ubuntu Mate).

You cannot \"get rid\" of the Windows boot loader, it's part of Windows. Normally, if there is only one Windows installation, you don't get a menu or any options, it just boots into Windows. Somehow, that \"boot helper\" you installed, wrote an additional menu entry to the WINDOWS boot loader. When you installed Ubuntu, and grub, that Windows boot loader simply became an option in the grub menu. You can't fix it from Ubuntu or grub, it needs to be fixed from Windows, with BootRec or such. Then you'll probably have to rebuild the grub menu, or just reinstall Linux once you have Windows booting the way you want. The correct way to set up a multiboot system with Linux is to always install Windows FIRST, then Linux/grub. Othewise, Windows simply overwrites the MBR and your grub menu disappears. Windows is not designed to allow other boot managers, nor will it automatically add non-Windows operating systems to it's own menu...though this can be done manually.\n", "Q: Explanation of the command to check shellshock Here is the command I have used to check my bash shell for the Shellshock bug:\nenv x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c \"echo this is a test\"\n\nCan anyone please explain the command in details?\n\nA: This answer is a derivative of an original article on Fedora Magazine by Matthew Miller, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 license.\nLet me explain:\nenv x='() { :;}; echo OOPS' bash -c :\n\nThis will print “OOPS” on a vulnerable system, but exit silently if bash has been patched.\nenv x='() { :;}; echo OOPS' bash -c \"echo this is a test\"\n\nThis will print “OOPS” on a vulnerable system, but print “this is a test” if bash has been patched.\nAnd you’ve probably heard that it has something to do with environment variables. But, why is code in environment variables getting executed? Well, it’s not supposed to be — but, because of a feature which I’m tempted to call a bit too clever for its own good, there’s some room for a flaw. Bash is what you see as a terminal prompt, but it also is a scripting language, and has the ability to define functions. You do that like this:\n$ Ubuntu()  { echo \"Ubuntu is awesome.\"; }\n\nand then you have a new command. Keep in mind that the echo here isn’t actually run yet; it’s just saved as what will happen when we run our new command. This will be important in a minute!\n$ Ubuntu\n Ubuntu is awesome.\n\nUseful! But, let’s say, for some reason, We need to execute a new instance of bash, as a subprocess, and want to run my awesome new command under that. The statement bash -c somecommand does exactly this: runs the given command in a new shell:\n$ bash -c Ubuntu\n  bash: Ubuntu: command not found\n\nOoh. Sad. The child didn’t inherit the function definition. But, it does inherent the environment — a collection of key-value pairs that have been exported from the shell. (This is a whole ‘nuther concept; if you are not familiar with this, trust me for now.) And, it turns out, bash can export functions as well. So:\n$ export -f Ubuntu\n$ bash -c Ubuntu\n  Ubuntu is awesome.\n\nWhich is all well and good — except that the mechanism by which this is accomplished is sorta dodgy. Basically, since there is no Linux/Unix magic for doing functions in environment variables, the export function actually just creates a regular environment variable containing the function definition. Then, when the second shell reads the “incoming” environment and encounters a variable with contents that look like a function, it evaluates it.\nIn theory, this is perfectly safe, because, remember, defining a function doesn’t actually execute it. Except — and this is why we’re here — there was a bug in the code where the evaluation didn’t stop when the end of the function definition was reached. It just kepts going.\nThat would never happen when the function stored in an environment variable is made legitimately, with export -f. But, why be legit? An attacker can just make up any old environment variable, and if it looks like a function, new bash shells will think it is!\nSo, in our first example:\nenv x='() { :;}; echo OOPS' bash -c \"echo this is a test\"\n\nThe env command runs a command with a given variable set. In this case, we’re setting x to something that looks like a function. The function is just a single :, which is actually a simple command which is defined as doing nothing. But then, after the semi-colon which signals the end of the function definition, there’s an echo command. That’s not supposed to be there, but there’s nothing stopping us from doing it.\nThen, the command given to run with this new environment is a new bash shell, again with a “echo this is a test” or “do nothing :” command, after which it will exit, completely harmlessly.\nBut — oops! When that new shell starts up and reads the environment, it gets to the x variable, and since it looks like a function, it evaluates it. The function definition is harmlessly loaded — and then our malicious payload is triggered too. So, if you run the above on a vulnerable system, you’ll get “OOPS” printed back at you. Or, an attacker could do a lot worse than just print things.\n\nA: In unpatched version of bash it stores exported function definitions as environment variables. \nStore a function x as,\n$ x() { bar; }\n$ export -f x\n\nAnd check its definition as,\n$ env | grep -A1 x\nx=() {  bar\n}\n\nSo one could exploit this by defining his own environment variables, and interprets them as function definitions. For example env x='() { :;}' would be treated as\nx() { :;\n}\n\nWhat does the command to check shellshock do,\nenv x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c \"echo this is a test\"\n\nFrom man env, \n\n\n*\n\n*env - run a program in a modified environment.\n\n*: do nothing but exits with exit status 0. see more\n\n*When a new instance of unpatched bash launched as bash -c \"echo this is a test\", the crafted environmental variable is treated as a function and loaded. Accordingly one gets the output\n\n    vulnerable\n    this is a test\n\n\nNote: The echo outside the function definition has been unexpectedly executed during bash startup. The function definition is just a step to get the evaluation and exploit to happen, the function definition itself and the environment variable used are arbitrary. The shell looks at the environment variables, sees x, which looks like it meets the constraints it knows about what a function definition looks like, and it evaluates the line, unintentionally also executing the echo (which could be any command, malicious or not).

Now I want to add one 1 TB internal HDD and install Ubuntu 14.04 on it with dual boot. I've no need for Ubuntu 12.04. How to proceed?\n\nA: Just install Ubuntu 14.04 directly to your new internal HDD, from a usb flash drive or optical media. If your external drive will not be mounted on any usb port while you are doing the installation of 14.04, your new grub boot menu will only include the list of options 1.Ubuntu 14.04 and 2.Win7 on SSD. Later you may want to format your obsolete external HDD. \nThis methodology worked for me many times, since grub only checks the boot options of available operating systems and list those when you do an installation. \n", "Q: Script for hiding files I recently found a script for hiding desktop files and folders. The following is the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\ncd /home/ramvignesh/Desktop\nfor f in `ls`; do\nmv \"$f\" \".$f\"\ndone\n\nThe script isn't working properly.

Can anyone correct the script for me? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The script that you found is flawed with parsing output of ls command (you can read about why you shouldn't use ls in scripting here). \nA better approach is to use find command and pipe its output to xargs. \nSince in the original script you operate on the files that are in a specific directory, I've tailored the command accordingly. Navigate to the directory where you want to hide the files and run the part bellow:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name  \".*\" -printf \"%f\\0\" | xargs -0 -I file mv file .file\nHere is a small demo in my home directory.

You can test this by using a LiveCD/LiveUSB. If that works, Ubuntu'll work. You may need to install custom graphics drivers, though.\nRegarding CounterStrike 1.6:\nIf it is Linux-native, sure. It should work well enough, provided your system has good specs.\nIf it is not Linux-native, you might have luck with WINE. However, this does not mean it will work. WINE (while good) is not perfect.

Why it is showing less memory than the actual?\n\nA: It's a common practice on laptops. The Graphic memory is usually shared with the main RAM of the system and it is dynamic, which means it increases and decreases on demand.\nIt can grow until 1,7 GB, and this value seems standard if you have a system with 4,0 GB of RAM, on Intel systems it's called DVMT:\n\nDynamic Video Memory Technology (DVMT) is a method for dynamically\n  allocating system memory for use as graphics memory to balance 2D/3D\n  graphics and system performance. If your computer is configured to use\n  DVMT, graphics memory is allocated based on system requirements and\n  application demands (up to the configured maximum amount). When memory\n  is no longer needed by an application, the dynamically allocated\n  portion of memory is returned to the operating system for other uses.\nMany graphic-intensive applications (especially games) require a\n  minimum amount of video memory in order to run correctly (or to run at\n  all). Video memory is allocated based on the amount requested by the\n  operating system. When the memory is no longer required, it is\n  returned to the operating system for use by other applications or\n  system functions.\nDVMT allocates memory based on system needs. Some newer systems have\n  an option in the system BIOS that adjusts the amount of memory\n  available for DVMT. Memory can be allocated up to the maximum limit\n  set by the graphics driver. Unlike previous operating systems, Windows\n  Vista* and Windows 7* have greater control over memory management and\n  determines the amount of the graphics memory together with the Intel®\n  Graphics Driver.\n\nSource: http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-029090.htm\n", "Q: Renaming multiple files My security cameras recorder (located in distant place), FTP`s to my server video files after any event.

I tried installing again with the same results.\nSome searching online told me the problem I'm having may be related to the result of running the following in the terminal:\nsudo parted -l\n\nI tried that, and my results were:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo parted -l\nModel: ATA OWC Mercury EXTR (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 240GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End    Size   File system  Name                  Flags\n 1      1049kB  538MB  537MB  fat32        EFI System Partition  boot\n 2      538MB   794MB  256MB  ext2\n 3      794MB   240GB  239GB                                     lvm\n\n\nModel: Linux device-mapper (linear) (dm)\nDisk /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1: 8493MB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: loop\n\nNumber  Start  End     Size    File system     Flags\n 1      0.00B  8493MB  8493MB  linux-swap(v1)\n\n\nModel: Linux device-mapper (linear) (dm)\nDisk /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root: 231GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: loop\n\nNumber  Start  End    Size   File system  Flags\n 1      0.00B  231GB  231GB  ext4\n\n\nWarning: Unable to open /dev/sr0 read-write (Read-only file system).  /dev/sr0\nhas been opened read-only.\nError: Can't have a partition outside the disk! \n\nHope this helps, and thank you in advance!\n\nedit: another thread shows that the result of the following command may help:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nso here are my results:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'!

I cannot open the page https://outlook.office365.com/ on Linux. I understand office 365 mail may not work with thunderbird or evolution, but I don’t understand why I cant open it through firefox or chrome. \nany help would be greatly appreciated.\nthank you. \ncurrently using Ubuntu 12.04, but have also tried with 14.04. \nI get the following error when loading in firefox;\nFirefox can't find the server at outlook.office365.com.\nCheck the address for typing errors such as ww.example.com instead of www.example.com\nIf you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network connection.\nIf your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.\nIn chrome I get the following;\nThis web page is not available\nThe server at outlook.office365.com can't be found because the DNS look-up failed. DNS is the network service that translates a website's name to its Internet address. This error is most often caused by having no connection to the Internet or a misconfigured network. It can also be caused by an unresponsive DNS server or a firewall preventing Google Chrome from accessing the network.\nThank you.\n\nA: I was having a lot of trouble with https://outlook.office365.com/ as well. Sometimes the page would just load and load without ever giving an error.

Here are helpful instructions on how to do that. \n\nA: Same issue here. After our provider was acquired by another company, a new DNS server must be used. From the moment that the new DNS servers was used, I couldn't access outlook.office365.com for web access as well for IMAP mail. \nChanging DNS to Google's public DNS server at 8.8.8.8 solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 custom keyboard layout doesn't work I'm spent hours trying to get this to work, and I have no idea, what I'm doing wrong.

As of late my trusty old VPS (12.04LTS) has become slower and slower to the point where it's now completely unresponsive. I'm probably much at fault here as I've upgraded and installed packages without much thought. \nI'm thinking I should start fresh with a new 14.04 install, I would however like to keep the web server portion of my current VPS. It's set up with multiple websites, some which rely on a MySQL server also installed on the same VPS.\nMy current plan is to simply copy my /etc/apache2/* and /srv/www/*. I think that part should be straightforward (or?). However I am a bit unsure if I can copy the MySQL server in the same manner? I'm hoping to avoid doing a dump of all my databases one by one (there is quite a few).\n\nA: I don't think just copy/pasting the files containing the databases would work well. Your best option would be dumping the databases in .sql files and then restoring them when you install the system. It could be easily done with a web interface like phpmyadmin.\nAlso, when you copy the apache2 and /srv/www you may have to restore the privileges and owner (usually, files under www belong to www-data user and group).\nAnother thing, if you're going to do a fresh install, make sure you create separated partitions for /srv/www or /var/www (in the latest version, files are stored under /var/www/html)so the next time you can do an clean upgrade or even install without losing  your server files.\n", "Q: How to run Netbeans 8.0 as root I've installed Netbeans 8.0 on Ubuntu 12.04.

I wasn't quite sure what would be installed besides the desktop environment and I found that there's quite a lot installed that I don't need, like games, accessories and browser. Frankly, all I want is a file manager and maybe a way to connect with TeamViewer.\nReasoning: I've got a server with several harddisks that are shared over the network. However, when moving files from one share to the other, they're pulled over the network. Not what I want. I've tried all sorts of things and frankly what I want is to be able to have folderA and folderB side by side and drag/drop without transferring anything over the network. After a bit of research, I've decided that the best option would be to just add a GUI to my server and log in either directly or remote to do this. (Unless someone can find an FTP manager with side-by-side windows showing different folders but over the same connection)\nTL;DR: Can I strip down lubuntu-desktop or install just LXDE and a File Manager?\n\nA: For a bare minimum LXDE-based environment, you can install lxde-core without any recommended additional packages, instead of lubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends lxde-common lxde-core\n\nThis will give you the basic openbox window manager, plus the lxsession session manager and pcmanfm file manager. IIRC it does not install a display manager, so your server will continue to boot to a CLI and you will need to use startx to get the GUI environment.  You may need to create a minimal .xsession file in your home directory e.g.\necho 'lxsession -e LXDE -s LXDE' > $HOME/.xsession\n\n", "Q: New Asus laptop freezes every couple of minutes when on battery This problem is different than :\nNew asus with ubuntu keeps freezing\nand\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes\nActually i have 3 major problems I'll list according to importance :\nCouple of information first :\nI'm using ubuntu 14.04 64bits on newly purchased Asus SonicMaster s551l with touchscreen , it comes with dual video cards Intel's and nvidia gforce gt 740m (I'm using proprietary drivers).\nProblems :\n1- when on battery mode (no charger pluged in) ubuntu keeps freezing every 3 minutes (average) meaning nothing works except sound (mouse doesn't move or click, screen stays still i.e when playing video stays on the same frame), example when i play video on youtube then it freezes the sound keeps playing , until now my solution was to close the laptop led wait a couple of seconds then login and every works as nothing happened .\nthis is ubuntu only problem cause it doesn't happen in windows i tested before i asked here .  \n2- Touch screen related issues : i have unity laucher on auto hide but it doesn't show up when i swipe from the sides , plus chrome tabs can't be selected dragged closed (by touching x) or even create new tab by touching the \"+\" button.  \n3- Function + bright buttons don't work (only these two) , I can't play with screen brightness using the keyboard (i can still through the setting though) .   \n\nA: the first problem caused by nvidia driver\nif u dont have important files reinstall ubuntu then install nvidia proprietery driver ( NOT THE ONE TESTED , only PROPRIETERY ) then search in the dash for nvidia setting and set the graphic card as intel , the nvidia this time will not hang but it flikr a little thats why i told u to set intel as graph card\nu cant set brightness using keyboard shortcuts in ubuntu as far as i know so dont bother\ni have the same notebook except a non touch screen\nif ur a normal user intel will be fine for every thing in ubuntu\n\nA: 1- You can also switch drivers without reinstalling:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Additional Drivers\" utility\n\n*Select the driver you wish to use\n\n*Type your password\n\n*Wait for it install\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n2 - Unfortunately I don't own a touchscreen and have now idea how to fix this.

I couldn't live without this.  :)\n\nA: True, you certainly don't actually need Synaptic to do that stuff with your BCM adapter.  In linux everything ends up in a terminal anyway so there's nothing you can do in synaptic you can't do with apt-get.  Synaptic is a front and for apt-get.\nHowever you should still have synaptic IMO.  But in the future DO NOT use something like softpedia to install something like that.  I'd never use softpedia for anything.  It has a bad habit of adding attachments I'd consider malware.\nAlways look in the repos first, and don't use 3rd party ppa's until you know what you're doing a bit more, and I never use them unless there is no other way to do what I want to do.

And how I can restore grub from windows or I it isn't possible, how I repair my USB?\n\nA: You need to reinstall GRUB on Master hard drive - it'll automatically fix it and you will see that GRUB would also include both Windows and Ubuntu.  On your LIVE CD, do the same thing as if you were installing new system, but once you got past the hardware checking - cancel the process.

When I click on the album or song a small \"X\" icon appears to the left of the track number and skips the song. Please help.\n\nA: This is because Ubuntu 12.04 mounted the partitions at /media whereas Ubuntu 14.04 mounts the partition at /media/username. \nThe workaround here is to import the music library again.\nSelect all your songs using Ctrl + A then right-click and choose Remove from Library.\nNOTE: Make sure you don't choose Delete from Drive as this will delete all your songs.\nThen import them again using Media->Import media and choosing the specific folders or partitions. You will have to recreate your playlists again.\n\nA: The previous answer is a great start, to expand on it, there are two things I did that help ease the transition.  Before the Remove from Library action, export each of your playlists.  After importing the library, open the playlists in a text editor, Find and Replace /media with /media/username.  Then import the playlists back into Banshee.\nI had an extensive collection of podcasts that also needed to be updated.  In order to update these I needed to update the database that banshee uses.\nClose Banshee.\nInstall sqlite3 (if necessary).\n    sudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\nNow a trick I stole from the Banshee FAQ.

Today I wanted to compile brackets, when I run npm install it asked me to use later version such as 1.4.20. Default version of it is in /usr/bin/npm which did't work. The manually installed one is in /usr/local/bin/npm\nIs there any way to make  /usr/local/bin/npm as default path using update-alternatives or another method?\nFor example you can set default text editor with\n    sudo update-alternatives --config editor\n\n\nA: I've found how to do that. At first I checked out default path of  npm which is older version (1.3.10) in /usr/bin/npm , I noticed that it's a symbolic link to  /usr/share/npm/bin/npm-cli.js I removed it \n    sudo unlink /usr/bin/npm\n\nThen I tried following command \n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/npm  npm /usr/local/bin/npm 10\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/npm  npm /usr/share/npm/bin/npm-cli.js 20\n\nNow I can easily switch between them using \n  sudo update-alternatives --config npm      \n\nIt works well       \n\nA: Since you mentioned node, I thought I might point out that this is a good opportunity to use the N installation manager for NodeJS.  If I have a \"higher level\" package manager like this available, I'll typically use it over update-alternatives.  It's generally less complicated than trying to track down important files on your own, IMO.

I attempted to boot into Ubuntu from the partion created by choosing to boot from the Ubuntu partition on startup and then perfromed the steps in that answer. \nI was able to get grub on startup with the Windows Boot Loader(dev/sda2) entry, but surprisingly I keep getting thrown back into grub, no errors, just grub showing up again, I decided to boot into Ubuntu and reverted back to the state of my /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot directory before I performed the former step , and Windows booted again without any Boot Menu's. \nI have tried installing rEFInd and boot-repair in Ubuntu to fix this issue but they didn't help, I didn't even get a refind boot manager, neither did boot-repair, so currently the only way I've been able to boot into Ubuntu is by choosing advanced startup in Windows and then selecting to boot from Ubuntu's partitions. \nI think HP's EFI might be behind all this, cause I read so many tutorials on dual-booting Ubuntu on a UEFI-based Pc and they were all okay.  \n\nA: When installing any OS on an UEFI based computer and GPT disk\ninstallation source - USB/DVD - should be booted the UEFI way.\nNothing more.\nUbuntu GRUB can chainload Windows on BIOS and UEFI.\nWindows boot manager can chainload GRUB/Ubuntu only on BIOS/MBR.\nBootNext utility can boot Ubuntu/Linux directly from Windows.\n", "Q: How do I completely re-install my PC with only Ubuntu I have windows 7 and ubuntu on my computer.

It has been discontinued as of Ubuntu 13.04. It had many bugs and was unstable in general. \nHowever, if you really want to, you can still run Wubi. Note that you will need to have Windows 7 to run these steps. Wubi is not tested/supported on Windows 8.

You have been warned!\n\nA: Wubi is no longer supported as of ubuntu 12.10 (I believe) except for special situations. Instead of just mounting it like that I suggest creating a live usb or dvd and booting up a full live session.\nAlso, if you were trying to use wubi to install so you can use ubuntu from within windows 7 then my recommendation is to use a virtual machine as you can make a full virtualized installation from wubi.\n", "Q: Videos freeze in fullscreen mode in Chrome and Firefox When I maximize a flash OR HTML5 video, e.g. on youtube, the picture freezes but the video continues to play.

Is there any another way to get  access to these drives?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: This is probably because the ntfs filesystems were not unmounted by Windows and thus are marked dirty.

This is what I want to achieve:\n\n\n*\n\n*Owner (server account): Full control (chmod number 7xx)\n\n*Group (users that sign in to the samba server) : Only place (drop) files,so this means don't open/edit/delete files in the folder (chmod number x?x) \n\n*others : no access (chmod number xx0)\nI have tried a lot of different chmod settings but never achieved the wanted result. Is this even possible? I googled a lot but couldn't really find a concluding answer.\nMaybe a way to set permissions on files whenever they are placed in the folder?\nIf you need more information about the samba configuration or anything else please ask!\nThank you for helping out!\n\nA: Unfortunately, your problem is not solvable so easily. If a user has write permission in a directory, he can also delete files. Even if he wasn't able to delete them, he could still fill a file with zeros, which would be a deletion of data, but not of the filesystem node.\n\nAn idea which I once used:\nYou create a cronjob, which recusively removes the write permission of every file in a directory tree (like every file in /home/guest).\nNote that you can't simply use chmod g-w -R /home/guest. This would take the write bit off the directories too, making it impossible to place new files there. So you'd need to iterate over every file and remove it's group write bit.\nThe interval of the cronjob execution is up to you - back then I set it to 10 minutes. I don't know your environment, so I can't give you a recommendation.\nUnfortunately I don't have this script any more, so you'll have to do some bash scripting to get it to work. But seriously, I doubt that this is an efficient method.\n\nA: Try this procedure.\nCreate shared folder and give right permission:\n  mkdir /pathYouWant/share\n  chmod 770 /pathYouWant/share\n\nThis gives no access to other.\n  chmod +t /pathYouWant/share\n\nThis mode, according to chmod manual page:\n   The  restricted  deletion  flag  or  sticky  bit is a single bit, whose\n   interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it  prevents\n   unprivileged  users  from  removing or renaming a file in the directory\n   unless they  own  the  file  or  the  directory\n\nAs told by Marty Fried files created in the share folder should have the right permissions and this can be achieved with samba share masks in smb.conf:\n  create mask = 440\n  directory mask = 550\n\nWindows programs shouldn't try to remove read-only files unless delete readonly option is set to yes.\n  delete readonly = no\n\nAlso if you want to hide all file in share folder:\n  veto files = /*/\n  delete veto files = no\n\nAccording to samba manual these directive:\n\nWhat happens if the user tries to delete a directory that contains\n  vetoed files? This is where the delete veto files option comes in. If\n  this Boolean option is set to yes, the user can delete both the\n  regular files and the vetoed files in the directory, and the directory\n  itself is removed. If the option is set to no, the user cannot delete\n  the vetoed files, and consequently the directory is not deleted\n  either. From the user's perspective, the directory appears empty, but\n  cannot be removed.\n\nAfter this configuration, the only problem left is that user can still delete his/her own files even if he/she do not see it (It is unclear to us why).\nSo we decide to follow the_Seppi suggestion to complete the task and Bram Driesen did a script that changes file ownership to the host pc. \nHe used incron to fire the script whenever a file is placed in the folder, following this as guide to set it up.          \n\nA: We can modify the files and folders but can't delete.\nTo remove the attributes, run the following commands:\nFor files:\nsudo chattr -R -a file.txt\n\nFor directories: \nsudo chattr -R -a dir1/\n\n", "Q: Using specific python version for apt-get in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I have python2.7.3-0Ubuntu3.5 package installed.\nOne of the libraries i am trying to install has dependency on (>=2.7.3.6).\nI went ahead and installed python 2.7.6 and even python --version shows 2.7.6\nBut when I run apt-get install to install the package it gives me error message:\nHas dependency on (>=2.7.3.6) but python2.7.3-0Ubuntu3.5 is to be installed.\n\nI am just wondering why is it still pointing to python2.7.3-0Ubuntu3.5.\nAny help will be appreciated.

After a lot of searching, I came across this kernel bug thread:\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81331\nAfter downloading the patch in post 135 in that thread ( https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=145981 ) I applied this to the latest upstream kernel (3.17.0 at the time of this writing), recompiled and booted-- and now the touchpad gets recognized and works fine from a cold boot. (2-finger scrolling, and toggling the touchpad on and off with Fn+F6 works too!)\nIt's being recognized thus:\nI: Bus=0011 Vendor=0002 Product=000e Version=0000\nN: Name=\"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\"\nP: Phys=isa0060/serio1/input0\nS: Sysfs=/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/input/input6\nU: Uniq=\nH: Handlers=mouse0 event5\nB: PROP=5\nB: EV=b\nB: KEY=e420 10000 0 0 0 0\nB: ABS=661800011000003\n\n", "Q: Can't boot laptop from USB; error in 1 file My Windows 8.1 laptop won't recognize my USB stick, which has the Ubuntu ISO installed on it with the USB Universal Installer. My desktop, which dual-boots Windows 7 and Ubuntu, will recognize the drive as a bootable device, but when I boot from it it crashes. Performing a scan revealed that the drive has an error in 1 file, and I'm not sure how to fix it. I've tried re-formatting the drive multiple times, no success. Any tips?\n\nA: If multiple recreations of the bootstick result in the same file error, the most likely cause is a corruption of the downloaded ISO image.\nDownload the image again and check for its MD5 sum (supplied at the download site)\nOr even better: Download the image as torrent. The BitTorrent protocol automatically validates the downloaded data using checksums. If a block is corrupted, only this 16kB section needs to be downloaded again. This is the safest way to download any image, as long as you can trust the origin of the .torrent file.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make ntpd -gq run faster This question is related to this question and this earlier question I asked on serverfault.\nPer my previous question, I'm interested in synchronizing the time on my machine in a fast (ideally less than a second), synchronous (if the process completes with 0 status, the time should be synced), and robust way (\"robust\" here meaning that as long we receive a response from the ntp server, the time should be set according to the response). I will run ntp in the background after this fast initial sync.\nUsing ntpdate seems to be too flaky, and isn't recommended anyway (I get sporadic \"no server available errors\", I think mostly stemming from discrepancies with the ntp server, not from a failure to reach the ntp server). However, one good thing about ntpdate is that it has an option -p that lets me shorten the time it takes to set my time to mere milliseconds (when it works).\nUsing sudo ntpd -gq, as suggested in the previous questions seems to make clock syncing more reliable, but it takes at least 7-8 seconds on my machine, presumably because ntpd is taking several samples with intervening sleep time. Worse, ntpd often hangs for minutes before exiting successfully. I'm not sure why this happens because the ntp server is reachable and responding to requests all throughout this timespan.\nThus, I'm looking for a way hopefully to speed up the time it takes to synchronize a machines clock using ntpd -gq, and I'm willing to sacrifice a few milliseconds of initial clock accuracy in order to have faster clock synchronization. The reason I'm willing to make this sacrifice is that synchronization is part of a bootstrap process that I'm running many times per day and waiting 8 seconds to several minutes for ntp to run each time is slowing the process down (to the point that I have no choice but to accept ntpdate's fast but deprecated and unreliable behavior).\nIs there a way to achieve reliable fast performance with ntpd?\nEDIT: Here is my ntp.conf (if you're wondering about the location of server, it was programmatically appended to the file after stripping out all existing servers):\n# /etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd; see ntp.conf(5) for help\n\ndriftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift\n\n\n# Enable this if you want statistics to be logged.\n#statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/\n\nstatistics loopstats peerstats clockstats\nfilegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable\nfilegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable\nfilegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable\n\n# Specify one or more NTP servers.\n\n# Use servers from the NTP Pool Project.

Why not run a local ntp server so the time is super quick to set and you dont have to worr about connecting to ntp servers on internet? \n", "Q: Please help install an Ubuntu desktop I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 base system on my IBM Thinkpad labtop.

(i.e. without -a or -p options)\n\n\nA: Advisory note: It would be a very good idea to backup the entire file system before performing any changes or fixes to it. If you don't have enough space for that use e2image(8) as an emergency precaution.\nFixing corrupt superblocks [Edit]\nAccording to your comment you have a corrupt file system superblock. There's an answer on serverfault that deals with this.\nSince it's impossible to find the correct block size without a working superblock, I would guess from the volume size of 400 GB that the block size is 4 KiB, which leads to a superblock backup position of 32768. Therefore\ne2fsck -b 32768 -p /dev/sda5\n\nand then take it from there depending on the output.\nFighting the repetitive user interaction requests\nI pulled the following from the e2fsck(8) manual:\n\n-p     Automatically  repair  (\"preen\")  the  file system.  This option\n       will cause e2fsck to automatically fix any  filesystem  problems\n       that  can be safely fixed without human intervention.  If e2fsck\n       discovers a problem which may require the  system  administrator\n       to  take  additional  corrective  action,  e2fsck  will  print a\n       description of the problem  and  then  exit  with  the  value  4\n       logically  or'ed  into  the  exit  code.   (See  the  EXIT  CODE\n       section.)  This option is normally used  by  the  system's  boot\n       scripts.   It may not be specified at the same time as the -n or\n       -y options.\n\n-y     Assume  an answer of `yes' to all questions; allows e2fsck to be\n       used non-interactively.  This option may not be specified at the\n       same time as the -n or -p options.\n\n\nThe -p-option is the safer route in case there are other serious errors, but if that doesn't work, try -y.\nclone_file_block error\nThis appears to be a known bug. You can try your luck with a newer version of the e2fsprogs packages from the pre-release Utopic series through Launchpad or with a live system image.\n", "Q: WiFi does not work Just installed ubuntu and my wifi does not work. \nI ran the script you have and this is the output I got. \nI have no idea what I should do now.. \nI know I have atheros AR2413/AR2414. \nI think I have ath5k. \nno idea what these mean. \n########## wireless info START ##########\n\nReport from: 29 Sep 2014 00:26 IDT +0300\n\nBooted last: 29 Sep 2014 00:24 IDT +0300\n\nScript from: 20 Sep 2014 23:04 UTC +0000\n\n##### release ###########################\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\n##### kernel ############################\n\nLinux 3.13.0-36-generic #63-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 3 21:30:45 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nParameters: ro, quiet, splash, vt.handoff=7\n\n##### desktop ###########################\n\nUbuntu\n\n##### lspci #############################\n\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I can't change nothing, not even my wallpaper. \nAny ideas? \n\nA: I had this problem after I installed cinnamon, had to remove it.  Wish I could comment.\n\nA: Does your account have necessary permissions to make changes? You may want to check it by typing in terminal group and it will show what groups you belong to. \nNext thing, you can actually change the user background the hard way. There is a profile folder for each user stored in /var/lib/AccountsService/users. For instance, /var/lib/AccountsService/users/sergiy is my account profile. What you can do is to edit that file with the text editor of your choice. I prefer nano. So what I type is this:\nsudo nano /var/lib/AccountsService/users/sergiy\n\nIt will prompt for your password (considering that you're in sudoer group, of course) and open the file. Locate line starting with [User] and line saying Background . Paste the path to your desired wallpaper after = sign. For instance, here's mine:\n\nAfter you're done editing , reboot.\nAnd one more thing, I've discovered that file  org.freedestop.Accounts.service prevents changes to greeter backgrounds, and most likely to user backgrounds. So try editing this file with a text editor to comment out Exec line. Again, for me this is\nsudo nano /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.Accounts.service\n\nChange Exec=/usr/lib/accountsservice/accounts-daemon to # Exec=/usr/lib/accountsservice/accounts-daemon\nTry this first, and let me know if this helps. I've discovered that after commenting out that line, I was able to change lightdm-gtk greeter background, while previously I could not - it would just override whatever settings I placed into lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf, and show my desktop background instead of the image i wanted. \nNote: keep in mind that the first solution I posted, will only work if that Exec line is active, not commented out. Second solution, disables Accounts service\nLet me know if this helps. Cheers\n\nA: Simply try using gnome-tweak-tool: in \"Desktop\" tab, toggle \"Icons on Desktop\" On. Now you can change wallpaper through \"Background Location\" option, or even using Ubuntu System Settings -> Appreance (that previously was only changing login screen wallpaper). At the end, you can toggle it off, again, if you like.\n", "Q: flash player doesn't work on chromium I have upgraded to 14.04LTS and my flash player doesn't work on chromium facebook only!!! It is the latest version of adobe, and works on you tube, as well as with firefox facebook.\nAm I missing something here???\n\nA: Chromium, such as Chrome, recently dropped support for NPAPI (Netscape Plugin API) plugins, when they introduced their new Pepper Plugin API (PPAPI). So most older plugins don't work any more, including Adobe Flash Player.\nTo get Flash back, you have to use Google's own Flash Player called Pepper Flash. In Chrome, it's installed automatically. But not in Chromium, since Pepper Flash is a close-source project by Google.\nTo install Pepper Flash for Chromium, install the package pepperflashplugin-nonfree.\nThe fact that it works with YouTube is because YouTube doesn't use Flash any more. Where possible, it now uses the HTML5 video tag, and only uses Flash as a fallback for older browsers.\n", "Q: split string with a certain character to form a path I have a string abc_d_e75_f10_xyz_l_11 I want to split it so that I want to construct a string of an existing directory from this string to cd to it.\nSo in this example  abc_d_e75_f10_xyz_l_11 I want to split using the _ character where I want to write this command cd /home/userA/abc/d_e75_f10 and neglect the rest of the string.\n\nA: You can do:\necho \"abc_d_e75_f10_xyz_l_11\" | sed 's/_/\\//' | cut -d \"_\" -f1-3\nThis will replace the first _ with / as well as trim the string.\nOutput:\nabc/d_e75_f10\n\nA: You can use the bash shell's built-in string manipulation capabilities e.g.\n$ var=\"abc_d_e75_f10_xyz_l_11\"\n$ echo \"/home/userA/${var/_//}\"\n/home/userA/abc/d_e75_f10_xyz_l_11\n\n\nA: You want sed.\nsed is a tool for performing search and replace operations on text.\nIn this case it seems like you want to replace the first occurrence of _ with /.\nThis will do that:\n    echo \"abc_d_e75_f10_xyz_l_11\" | sed \"s/_/\\//\"\nIt looks wierd with the slashes but the idea is \"s/search/replace/\".

I'm trying to link Matlab to the latest JRE, and I'm getting an extremely slow GUI for which the solution seems to be to link Matlab to an older X11 library.\nSince the problem is essentially caused by the new X11 libs being slow on the interface with Matlab through Java, I was thinking that perhaps a lighter implementation focused on performance such as in LXDE might do the job.\nI installed the LXDE package without trouble, but now I'm looking for the corresponding libX11.so.?. Do you know where I might find that library?\n\nA: LXDE still depends on X11 libraries, see the following dependency chain:\n$ apt-cache depends -i lxde\nlxde\n  Depends: lxde-core\n  [...]\n$ apt-cache depends -i lxde-core\nlxde-core\n  Depends: lxde-common\n  [...]\n$ apt-cache depends -i lxde-common\nlxde-common\n  Depends: lxsession\n$ apt-cache depends -i lxsession\nlxsession\n  Depends: libc6\n  Depends: libdbus-glib-1-2\n  Depends: libglib2.0-0\n  Depends: libgtk2.0-0\n  Depends: libpolkit-agent-1-0\n  Depends: libpolkit-gobject-1-0\n  Depends: libx11-6\n  Depends: lxsession-data\n  Depends: lxsession-logout\n  Depends: laptop-detect\n\nFinally the libX11.so.? is provided by libx11-6 at the following location (for a x86_64 system): \n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6\n\n", "Q: Move RAID 1 Array to new system I am rebuilding my Ubuntu home server, but I want to preserve my two disks currently in Linux software RAID 1.\nMy current config is:\nOne 240GB HDD configured as OS Disk (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)\nTwo 3TB WD Reds configured as Linux RAID 1 - contains home files, pictures, videos, backups, etc\nFor a number of reasons, I need to re-build the system on a new OS Disk with Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, which will be a 240GB SSD.  With the new system, is there a way to mount the two RAID drives without (a) losing data and (b) needing to rebuild the RAID array?\nThanks!\n\nA: Based on David Foerster's answer, I moved forward.  I was able to successfully migrate the RAID volume.  One detail that complicated the move was that I had the RAID array as part of the LVM Group.  So once I had the new system re-built, the RAID array was recognized, but I was unable to mount any of the LVMs.\nI ended up having to use vgexport/vgimport to export and import the volume group.  It is a good thing I was installing to a new OS Disk, meaning I still had my old OS disk, which allowed me to revert back and properly export LVMs.  The procedure I followed is here on tldp.org(except this is missing the deactivation and reactivation of logical volumes).\nMy original configuration was:\n\n\n*\n\n*2x3TB Disks in Linux RAID1 with a single Ext4 partition for file storage data (no OS).\n\n*3TB RAID array added as the sole device within volume:  /dev/NASRaid1/NAS_LVM\n\n*/dev/NASRaid1/NAS_LVM mounted to filesystem as /nfs\nSteps taken to export and import the volume were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount filesystem(s):  unmount /nfs\n(I also had an export mirror for a Samba share that I had to un-mount as well)\n\n*Deactivate logical volume(s):  lvchange -an /dev/NASRaid1/NAS_LVM\n\n*Deactivate volume group:  vgchange -an NASRaid1\n\n*Export the volume group:  vgexport NASRaid1\n\n*Add RAID Array to new system and boot up.  Running pvscan lists the exported volume group(s).\n\n*Import the volume group:  vgimport NASRaid1\n\n*Activate the volume group:  vgchange -ay NASRaid1\n\n*Activate the volume(s):  lvchange -ay /dev/NASRaid1/NAS_LVM\n\n*Mount the filesystem(s):  mkdir -p /nfs; mount /dev/NASRaid1/NAS_LVM /nfs\nWorked like a charm.\n\nA: mdadm stores all the necessary info to reassemble a RAID in the volume header. As soon as you configure it correctly in your new system it should pick up the existing volumes.\n", "Q: Install CDE on Ubuntu Is it possible that I can I install CDE through apt-get on Ubuntu 14.04 64-Bit?

Developed between 1993 and 1999, it has\n  now been released under an Open Source licence by The Open Group.\n\n\nCDE project has detailed build instructions in their wiki.\nMy understanding is that Linux port of CDE is currently an alpha-quality software and has \"quite a few known security vulnerabilities\".

What I am looking to do is just hide, delete, or obfuscate a portion of history on my display in my session, namely a command that I inputted that I do not want the user to see.\n\nSo take that as an example; I want to hide what is circled in red, but keep everything above and below it in view.\n\nA: OK, first of I think this is what you need: tput command . Basically it allows user to redraw the screen without closing the session. Look at the screen capture of my terminal window:\n\nBasically, I executed command ls *.c just to fill the screen with something. Then I execute command tput cup 4 0; echo \"THIS LINE WILL BE COVERED WITH THIS ALL CAPS TEXT :)\" , and that basically places your prompt onto line 4 column 0, and executes echo to cover line 5 row 0. This will stay there even if you scroll back. \nNow , suppose you just have executed the command you dont wanna user to see. So for instance, I executed iwconfig, but do not wanna user to see my WI-FI name. I execute command and count which line it is on. In my example the wlan0 ESSID was on line 7, so I execute tput cup 6 4; echo \"I DO NOT WANT USER TO SEE THIS PART\". \n\nNow pay attention, because this only redraws the screen ! The actual command remains in the .bash_history file. After you done with the session, you can re-open the terminal and manually delete the line you do not want. If I execute ls command and scroll back, that part of screen is still obfuscated.\nAmong other things I've found, tput reset clears screen completely, and if you wanna hide just output, pipe the output into /dev/null. For instance echo \"This will never show on screen\" > /dev/null\nOld answer:  In dropdown menu go to Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Scrolling tab. \nChange number of Scrollback lines to whatever you desire. The terminal wont scroll back beyond that value of lines you entered in the terminal. \nFor instance, my terminal window is about 41 lines long, but since I've set it to only 10 lines of scroll back, the terminal does not scroll back at all.\n\n\nA: First make sure you close all terminal windows and shell sessions.\nThen open file ~/.bash_history in gedit ( or anoter GUI editor) and delete the lines you do not want.\n", "Q: How to combine multiple text files into one text file ordered by date created?

You will have to see if it works in your situation.\nIf that is acceptable for you, you can use the script below to create a combined file with your notes. It reads the notes, sorts them and appends them to a text file (creates it if it doesn't exist). \nThe good news is that you can append your new notes to the same file without overwriting the old ones.\nExample output:\nMon Sep 29 08:48:31 2014\nThis is my first note.\nAs you can read, I am not really awake yet.\n\n----------\nMon Sep 29 09:04:06 2014\nIt is really time I am going to eat something.\nI am a bit hungry.\nMaking it a bit longer.\n\n----------\n\nHow to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as add_notes.py\n\n*change the directories for files_dir (where your notes are) and the file in which you want to save the notes: combined_file (the script creates the file if it doesn't exist)\n\n*run the script in a terminal window by typing the command:\npython3 /path/to/add_notes.py\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport time\nimport subprocess\n\n# --------------------------------------------------------\nfiles_dir = \"/path/to/your/textfiles\"\ncombined_file = \"/path/to/your/combined/file.txt\"\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\nnotes = []\n\nif not os.path.exists(combined_file):\n    subprocess.Popen([\"touch\", combined_file])\n\ndef read_file(file):\n    with open(file) as note:\n        return note.read()\n\ndef append_file(combined_file, text):\n    with open(combined_file, \"a\") as notes:\n        notes.write(text)\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(files_dir):\n    for name in files:\n        subject = root+\"/\"+name\n        cr_date_text = time.ctime(os.path.getmtime(subject))\n        cr_date_n = os.stat(subject).st_mtime\n        notes.append((cr_date_n, cr_date_text, subject))\n\nnotes.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nfor note in notes:\n    text = note[1]+\"\\n\"+read_file(note[2])+\"\\n\"+\"-\"*10+\"\\n\"\n    append_file(combined_file, text)\n\n\nA: Here is a bash solution.

I connect the cable, but I see another desktop and can't listen to audio, I would want to hear the pc audio and see the same as in my monitor, is it possible? Thanks.\n\nA: I get HDMI video working fine with my Sony 32″ LCD TV as external screen. But audio has been a problem for long time. Here is a simple technique to enable audio through HDMI so that you can enjoy the high quality sound through TV or Home Theatre System.\nMotherboard: M3N78-EM based on NVIDIA GeForce 8300 Chipset\nOperating System: Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin\nHere is my VGA controller information:\n$ lspci | grep VGA\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation C77 [GeForce 8300] (rev a2)\n\n\n*\n\n*First we need to ensure that NVIDIA proprietary driver is installed. Ubuntu installed the NVIDIA driver by default while installing (I had opted for third party software installation option during installation). System Settings -> Additional Drivers  should show the dialog as shown below. In shell, you can see “nvidia” for the command “lsmod | grep nvidia”.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Configure the screen connected to HDMI Port. In case of NVIDIA, Ubuntu provided System Settings -> Displays tool does not detect the external Display. But NVIDIA provides a powerful GUI based settings tool, which makes the job easier. This tool can be accessed through dash by typing “NVIDIA” -> “NVIDIA X Server Settings” -> “X Server Display Configuration”. Don’t forget to click “Save to X Configuration File” to save your changes before quitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select the HDMI Audio as output device in Volume Indicator (on top bar) -> Sound Settings… -> Output -> HDMI / Display Port.\n\n\n\nThe above steps should get the job done. If not you can check status of S/PDIF settings. It should not be muted. You can check with “alsamixer” command. The following screenshot shows S/PDIF muted.\n\nSelect the muted S/PDIF bar and press M to unmute it. It should be as shown in the below screen.\n\nIt should fix the issue. You should be enjoying the audio over HDMI now. Now you can make it permanent by issuing “sudo alsactl store” command which will save the above settings.\nIn case you did not get succeed, you may try the following tweak.\nCreate a file called /etc/asound.conf (if there is a file already, just backup that file) with following content and reboot the machine.\npcm.!default hdmi:NVidia\npcm:iec958 hdmi:NVidia\n\nA: If the above does still not work and you still have no sound over hdmi.\nAfter days of banging my head against a wall I discovered a section in the ALSA website about a bug in the 14.04 Kernel which sends sound to the the wrong hdmi ports or dummy devices. \nALSA Site says;\n\nIn Linux kernel 3.8-rc1, a regression was introduced which could cause\n  GeForce 520 and newer GPUs to route audio to an unexpected monitor.\n  The selected monitor may not even be connected or be capable of\n  receiving audio, and hence audio may be lost. On system boot, the\n  monitor corresponding to ALSA physical stream ID 3 is likely selected\n  as the audio sink irrespective of which ALSA device is used to play\n  audio. The routing may change following attempts to play multiple\n  audio streams at once. This regression was introduced by the following\n  commit:\n  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6169b673618bf0b2518ce413b54925782a603f06\n  \"ALSA: hda - Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP\"\nThis patch is included in Linux kernel 3.8-rc1.

What if I were to buy/install like a 16GB SSD and the latest version of Ubuntu, would I likely see more of an improvement if any on battery life?\nThe biggest problem I'm currently experiencing is that as an engineering student running this laptop as a secondary computer to run to class with, it's obviously slow being old and running on Intel Atom, and if i prioritize speed over battery life, I'll get at best 45 min to an hour of battery life, and that's hardly sufficient enough to get by one class. I figured converting to SSD would definitely improve performance and allow me to run tasks faster, and using Ubuntu which is a far simpler platform to Windows 7 I'd browse the web at superb speeds efficiently, and running Wine I'd be able to open Word and Excel and run my files off a cloud service despite the lack of storage space. \nWhat does everyone else think? Open to suggestions. Thanks in advance. \n\nA: Changing the HDD to and SSD would indeed give you more battery life, but probably not more than 15-30 minutes. Ubuntu is not really more power saving than windows, but if you run a desktop environment that is low on processes and not too shiny, you can probably get some more minutes out of it.\nI would suggest you try it out from a Live DVD/USB. See how long the battery lives on that with the HDD. If you got the money to spare, check also with the SSD. Maybe even just install Ubuntu on the SSD and just change the disk according to what suits you better.\nAlso, old batteries tend to loose capacity over the years. I've got a laptop that just cannot hold power more than 45 minutes, because of bad cells in the battery. So maybe consider trying with a new battery as well. \n\nA: I run my main laptop on solar power all the day and have limited power.\nReducing CPU clock speed helps the most in my experience.\nYou can install CPUfreq tool, and set a Powersave option or manually set the lowest clock speed.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nAlso switching off Wifi from device physical on/off switch will improve battery timing significantly.\nI've been on Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 12.04 and now 14.04. There is no difference in Power Consumption, though I feel a little (10%-15%) performance hit now that I'm on 14.04 LTS. There is nearly 35% - 40% reduced power consumption by under-clocking. Nearly another 10% when I switch Wifi down.\nI also apply these settings on my Intel Atom powered Hp-mini 200 netbook, battery lasts around 6-7 hours while programming. While, around 3 hours while playing Videos.\n", "Q: How to fix \"not a valid identifier\" error after setting environment variables? I'm trying to setup cocos2dx in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but after setting the environmental variables (in .bashrc) I start getting this error:\nbash: export: dev/cocos2d-x-3.2/tools/cocos2d-console/bin': not a valid identifier \nbash: export:/home/john/android': not a valid identifier \nbash: export: dev/android-ndk-r10b': not a valid identifier \nbash: export:dev/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/sdk': not a valid identifier\n\nAnd I don't know what to do to fix it.\n\nA: \nbut after setting the environmental variables\n\nIt looks like you did not do that correctly.\nThe errors you're getting mean that the paths (like /home/john/android) are being used as the names of variables, rather than as the values assigned to them.\n\n\n*\n\n*The correct syntax to assign a variable is NAME=value.\n\n*The correct syntax to export a variable (with whatever value, if any, it has already been assigned) is export NAME.\n\n*The correct syntax to assign and export a variable (with the assigned value) at the same time is export NAME=value.\n\n\nI suspect you are attempting to do the third thing but using wrong syntax. Five common mistakes that could produce errors like what you're seeing are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using spaces instead of =. export NAME value is incorrect; value is then interpreted as the name of a subsequent variable to export.\n(This happens because export NAME1 NAME2 is correct syntax for exporting multiple variables.)\n\n*Putting spaces around =. In many programming languages, it's both valid and stylistically preferred to pad operators with spaces most of the time. But to assign a value to a variable in a shell script (or other situation where you are issuing shell commands), this is not allowed. NAME = value (in an export command or otherwise) won't work; you must use NAME=value.\n(export NAME = value tries to export variables named NAME, =, and value. Fortunately this never appears to succeed silently because attempting to export a variable called = is a syntax error. In contrast export NAME= value will appear to work, but does not assign value to NAME--instead, it assigns the empty, zero-length string to NAME and exports it, and separately exports the variable value. Both are common mistakes.)\n\n*Separating parts of the variable's value with spaces. Environment variables can contain spaces, but in practice they are rarely used as field separators in environment variables. When a single variable intentionally contains multiple paths, usually : is used to separate them.\n\n*Not quoting spaces when assigning to variables. Sometimes an environment variable's value is supposed to contain a space. For example, it might be the name of a directory that really contains a space. In that case, it's necessary to quote any spaces.\nOne way to do this is to precede them with \\. See How can I protect parentheses passed to a cd command? and Unable to delete file for information on other ways--the methods presented in the answers apply, even though neither question is specifically about assigning to environment variables.\nFor example, here are a few ways to export the environment variable SILLYPATH with the value /home/ek/silly name/bin:\nexport SILLYPATH=/home/ek/silly\\ name/bin\n\nexport SILLYPATH='/home/ek/silly name/bin'\n\nexport SILLYPATH=\"/home/ek/silly name/bin\"\n\nOften when a folder that you must use in a shell or assign to a widely used environment variable contains a space, it might benefit from being renamed. (But sometimes that's impractical or undesirable.)\n\n*Assigning and/or exporting a variable when nothing had to be done at all. This is sort of a meta-mistake; the specific technical problem is often one of the above, but the solution is to get rid of the offending line, or some part of it, rather than fix it. Don't indiscriminately remove code from .bashrc, of course. But an export may have been accidentally added, or may inadvertently have more code in it than was intended. For example, suppose you meant to write:\necho 'export PATH=~/some.bin:\"$PATH\"' >>~/.bashrc; . ~/.bashrc\n\nThat would append to .bashrc, then re-source it. But suppose you instead wrote:\necho 'export PATH=~/some.bin:\"$PATH\" . ~/.bashrc' >>~/.bashrc  # WRONG!\nThen your export command would not just export an augmented value of PATH, but would also attempt to export variables named . and /home/your-username/.bashrc, which is not what you want. Since they contain characters that are prohibited in variable names, so you would get an error every time you start a new interactive bash shell.\nTo avoid this problem, I suggest editing .bashrc in an editor (e.g., nano ~/.bashrc, gedit ~/.bashrc) rather than redirecting output to the end of it with >>.\nI suspect this may be enough information for you to find and fix the bug in your .bashrc file. If you need further help, you should of course post the full contents of that file for analysis. (It is only by coincidence that your problem happened to be one sufficiently frequently encountered, and with a sufficiently transparent error message, to make a general answer like this one possible.)\n\nA: Eliminate spaces and the dollar sign. For instance this works just the same way you could set a django settings module on a web server via SSH ie:\nexport DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myapp.settings\n\n\nA: Make sure that you're running:\nexport ENV_VARIABLE\n\nRather than:\nexport $ENV_VARIABLE\n\nOtherwise, you are trying to export the value of the variable rather than the variable itself, so you will get this error.\n\nA: I was using dash '-' instead of underscore '_' in the variable name.\n# fails \n$ export MY-NAME=\"abc\"\n\n# success\n$ export MY_NAME=\"abc\"\n\n\nA: I've seen this one occurring quite frequently when you copy something with inverted commas (from the web) and update your environments or bashrc file.\nA good place to start would be to just manually type the inverted commas in the pasted content.\n", "Q: Disable brightness and keyboard back-light at start-up? I'm new with Linux and I have an issue that I have being researching and have not been able to find a solution so far. I was wondering if any help can be given. I have an Asus Q500A with Win-8 and Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit and Whenever i log-in to Ubuntu, it does so with full screen brightness and keyboard back-light at full . How do i get rid of this? How can I tweak the start-up setting for screen brightness and disable keyboard back-light at start-up?\nNote: I already tried this and is not working.\nAdd this to /etc/rc.local:\necho '2' > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\necho '0' > /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness\n\n\nA: To turn off the keyboard backlight on boot, you need to add this to /etc/rc.local:\necho '0' > /sys/devices/platform/[a name related to your laptop ]/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness\n\nYou have an Asus laptop but you input applesmc.768 so it didn't work. For my case I added to /etc/rc.local the following line:\necho '0' > /sys/devices/platform/dell-laptop/leds/dell\\:\\:kbd_backlight/brightness\n\nand it worked.\n\nA: 3 years later I'm facing the same issue in Debian with Mate. I solved it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a shellscript file in any path:\nsensible-editor login.sh\n\n\n*Add the following content to the file:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 3\ndbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply=literal --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower/KbdBacklight org.freedesktop.UPower.KbdBacklight.SetBrightness int32:0\n\n\n*Go to the Startup Applications\n\n\n*Add a new item there that will call the full path to the file this way:\nsh /full/path/to/file/login.sh\n\nNote in my case the sleep 3 was essential. You need the dbus-send to run after the backlight keyboard turns on and it turned on a few seconds after Mate started. So the waiting was needed but how many seconds might depend on each system.\nAlso note this approach is better than the /etc/rc.local one because you don't need to run anything as root and you can still change the backlight intensity after it runs. After updating /etc/rc.local it was fixed in 0.\n\nA: I first did the same thing you did but it didn't work for me neither.\nyou just need to add this to your /etc/rc.local:\necho '0' > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n(that one worked for me)\nIf that doesn't work try with xbacklight\napt-get install xbacklight\n\nafter the install \nxbacklight -set xx\n\nwhere xx is a value you'll have to experiment with for your particular system.\nFor the keyboard I have no clue for now, because I'm still having the same problem.\n", "Q: How to format unallocated space in ubuntu?

Here it would be pinning in the future.\nIs this possible? Or is there a PPA I could add in these old repositories?\nI don't want to just patch the shellshock vulnerability, I rather would like to add e repository, so I get frequent updates if there are more vulnerabilities found.\n\nA: The main reason we do not recommend running old unsupported releases is that they will not automatically get security fixes.\nFor bash releases 10.04 LTS, 12.04 LTS, and 14.04 LTS only will get a security update und upgrading.\nAdding a random ppa to an old release may introduce even more severe security issues in case you do not know the maintainers of this ppa. In addition, many ppa will often also not offer packages for old unsupported releases.\nHowever you can always downlaod and install any package from it's Debian package, which is available for download from official ressources. Only in case debendencies can not be resolved from a newer release to an old release we can not do so. For bash it should be safe to download and install from a newer downloaded Debian package, as dependencies are the same in new, and older releases (but possibly not in very old releases).\nFrom the link below select your release on top of the page (preselected for trusty), then select your architecture (amd64 or i386) at the bottom of the page for downloading a Debian package of bash from security.ubuntu.com.\n\n\n*\n\n*Packages Ubuntu \"bash\"\n\nA: If it doesn't work on your old system installing just the bash Debian package from security.ubuntu.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*Packages Ubuntu \"bash\"\ntry applying all patches to bash in a row by the script provided here:\nWhat is the CVE-2014-6271 bash vulnerability (Shellshock) and how do I fix it?\n", "Q: Updated some VM's from 12 LTS to 14.04.1 LTS, and now network throughput is bad, any ideas? I decided to bite the bullet after seeing the messages about going to 14, and ran the upgrade scripts. This all seemed to go well, so I kept going and updated all 3 of my VM's that are running Ubuntu server.\nAt this time, my servers all say they are 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-36-generic x86_64), and I thought were doing fine.   I just realized that for whatever reason, my outbound network throughput from any of the VM's is horrible.  If I am transferring a file to the servers it seems to work well, but as soon as I try and transfer a file off the server, I am lucky if I can get a couple meg on a GigE link.  I went and tried this on all three of my upgraded ubuntu VM's and all are acting the same.  I know they were fine under 12, as a couple of the machines ran pretty heavy bandwidth at times.\nTo see if it was just the upgraded ubuntu machines, I also have some VM's that are running FreeBSD, and some running CentOS, and doing file transfers on the other OS's are still working just fine, with great throughput.\nSo I am not sure what changed, but something happened with the updates to 14.04.01 that has really hammered it's networking.   I can't find anything sticking out that is wrong, so if anyone has any ideas how I can sort this out and get my VM's running well again it would sure be a big help..\nThanks, Howard..\n\nA: Is it possible to go back to 12.04? If so, do that! You probably have made snapshots. Make sure everything is working like before. \nThen create a test VM from one of the 12.04 snapshots. Update it to 14, see how that performs and proceed from there. This gives you time, as there is no need to update to 14 right now. \nWhen upgrading the live systems, only update one VM. Test it, leave it for a week, then do VM 2, etc. \n", "Q: Able to send outgoing emails, but not internal I've installed ssmtp and configured /etc/ssmtp.conf file and can successfully send outgoing emails, but I cannot send anything internally, i.e. whenever I type mail sergiy, which is my actual username on the machine, I can write and send a message, but I still get \"No new mail\".\nThen a few minutes later postmaster in my actual, web-based mail will send a \"Delivery Status Notification(Failure)\" message. Neither mail sergiy@localhost works.\nBasically, I want to be able to receive mail on my laptop, not just send it.\nI know I can check my web mail with mutt -f imaps://user@imapserver.example.com, but this is not what I'm trying to accomplish here.\nAlso, I've been getting emails of this type when I have root equal to my email address (in the file /etc/ssmtp/ssmpt.conf):\nSubject: Cron <smmsp@sergiy-Satellite-L455D> test -x /etc/init.d/sendmail && /usr/share/sendmail/sendmail cron-msp\n\nAnd here is the message itself:\n/usr/share/sendmail/sendmail: 899: /usr/share/sendmail/sendmail: /usr/sbin/sendmail-msp: not found\n\nWhat does cron keep complaining about here?\nAdditional information: According to this page (namely system mail) if you execute mail user, mailx assumes localhost, so you should be able to mail yourself or another user on your system. On my laptop neither my account, nor another account can receive mail if I do it this way.\n\nA: If you installed more than one MTA on your system, now or in the past, you might have leftovers of those installs.\nAs suggested elsewhere, try:  \n   sudo apt-get purge sendmail sendmail-bin\n\nMake sure that the following dependencies - sendmail-base,sendmail-cf and sendmail-bin - are removed.  Then reinstall sendmail.\nIf you have Postfix installed, you may not need to reinstall sendmail-bin.\nHTH \nFOLLOW-UP:\nsSMTP is only meant to send email to a mail hub. To the best of my knowledge you cannot use it for anything else. So, either you setup your machine as a mail server or you start using an outside mail hub.\nInstalling PostFix would be a way of acheiving what you want though. If you do so I would recommend you first uninstall ssmtp.\n", "Q: USB ports on external monitor are not recognized I have an external monitor (ASUS PB238Q) connected to my Ubuntu 14.04 laptop via HDMI.

It works out of the box on Ubuntu, but disconnects after a while, so I had to follow this guide.\n\n\nA: this guy has similar problem and he seems to found the reason and solve it.\nhope it will work for you too.\n\nA: So, after some discussions in the comments we found it's a problem in the wifi driver. The right way is to file a bug in the linux kernel bug tracker, or Ubuntu Kernel Team Bug Tracker.\nSince you seems like a developer who make things as strait as possible, you can try to find the bug and fix it yourself - get the kernel source using git, fix the bug in the driver (i never tried to send code to the kernel, good luck).\nmeanwhile you can use that workaround - just unload the kernel module before you shutdown your system. You can take a look at this answer on how to automate it. I see no reason to be afraid doing this. (the module is meant to be unloaded at shutdown anyway)\n", "Q: Lenovo Thinkpad Wireless Hard Blocked Until now my wlan has been working perfectly on a two week old 14.04 install on a brand new E540.

This functionality is fine for Windows where Fn + F8 actually toggles the hard block, but on linux it requires a restart with any LAN connections removed.\nSo the solution for now is to only connect my 3G modem after boot.\nUpdate:\nIf anyone knows how to toggle hard blocked network connections in linux, please to add an answer, this is really just an interim solution that doesn't fix the underlying issue.\n", "Q: How to configure iBall airway 3G usb modem in Ubuntu 14.04 I bought new iball Airway 21MP 3G modem last month.

Packages, like bumblebee, I want to remain as they are.   \nWhich packages should I remove and which should not be removed to get this done?\n\nA: Try:\nsudo apt-get --purge -y remove 'cuda*'\nsudo apt-get --purge -y remove 'nvidia*'\nsudo reboot\n\nIt removes any installed cuda and nvidia packages and then you can install any specific version that you like from: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive.\n\nA: This method will give a complete removal of Cuda:\nSimple\nremove the CUDA files in /usr/local/cuda-5.0\n\nAdvanced\n\nUninstall just nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nUninstall nvidia-cuda-toolkit and it's dependencies\nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nPurging config/data\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nor\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nAdditionally, delete the /opt/cuda and ~/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK folders if they are present. and remove the export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cuda/bin and export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/cuda/lib:/opt/cuda/lib64 lines of the ~/.bash_profile file\n\nA: One should NOT, unlike suggested in among others the accepted answer, manually remove files that were installed with apt (from some ppa, or nvidia repository).\nThe correct way to uninstall just cuda and keep your nvidia drivers would be:\nsudo apt purge \"libcublas*\" \"cuda-*\" cuda\n\nPossible, because they were installed as requirements, you can also\npurge,\nsudo apt purge \"nsight-*\" nvidia-modprobe\n\nAfter that you can, if you want, also remove the nvidia drivers with:\nsudo apt purge \"*nvidia*\"\n\nOf course, if you installed cuda using nvidia's .run file then this won't work; in that case you probably have some uninstall script.\n\nA: For removing cuda, Nvidia has prepared a file (I presume this is a standard method). You need to change your directory to the cuda's path, which is by default /usr/local/cuda-x.y/bin; where x.y is your cuda version, you can do this by using the below command: (I have cuda 9.0=x.y)\n cd /usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin\n\nThere is a file named uninstall_cuda_9.0.pl in this directory (please note that the cuda version is 9.0, so run the uninstall_cuda_9.0.pl to remove cuda completely from your system!\nchmod +x uninstall_cuda_9.0.pl\nsudo ./uninstall_cuda_9.0.pl\n\nAs soon as you enter your password, the cuda files will be erased. (This may take a few minutes)\nNOTE: How do you figure out which cuda has been installed on your Ubuntu system?\nBy using the command nvcc, you can see that my cuda version is 9.0 in the last line of the nvcc result.\nnvcc --version\n\nThe result will look like this:\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2017 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Fri_Sep__1_21:08:03_CDT_2017\nCuda compilation tools, release 9.0, V9.0.176 \n\nNote that the above method works if you set $PATH variable correctly, So if your nvcc command not works then please use the below command in terminal to find cuda version\nls /usr/local/ | grep cuda\n\nUPDATE\nI have installed cuda 10.2 on my system and it seems that there isn't uninstall_cuda_x.x.pl file, but nvidia replaced this file by cuda-uninstaller file in the same directory.\n\nA: Make sure the method you use to install cuda toolkit. This answer is for whom use deb files to install cuda. I have no idea if this works for .run files.\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge cuda \n\nThis can clear the cuda toolkit clearly. You can check that the folder /usr/local/cuda gone. And this command is the best choice to remove apt installed app.\nBut when you reinstall another version of cuda, you must use:\nsudo apt-get install cuda-x.x\n\nthe version number must be included. I tried to install another version of cuda after the remove of the previous version, I find that sudo apt-get install cuda will still install the previous one.\n\nA: For CUDA 10.1 or newer, try:\nsudo /usr/local/cuda/bin/cuda-uninstaller\n\nFor CUDA 10.0, try:\nsudo  /usr/local/cuda/bin/uninstall_cuda_10.0.pl\n\n\nA: Please refer the link below, which would help you decide whether your new installation and old installation of CUDA would be conflicting or not. If they aren't conflicting, you should be able to keep both of them.\nIf there is already a version of CUDA installed, you can do the following:\n\nThe method of uninstalling directly depends on the method of installation, whether it was a runfile, or a deb file, etc.\n\nUse the following command to uninstall a Toolkit runfile installation:\n$ sudo /usr/local/cuda-X.Y/bin/uninstall_cuda_X.Y.pl\nUse the following command to uninstall a Driver runfile installation:\n$ sudo /usr/bin/nvidia-uninstall\nUse the following commands to uninstall a Deb installation:\n$ sudo apt-get --purge remove <package_name>\nNvidia conflicting installations\n\nA: To remove packages without interruption (aggressive way) because there is no way others doing it.\nPKG=\"something\" ## in our case its Nvidia or/and CUDA \nfor item in `dpkg -i grep ${PGK} | awk '{print $2}'` ; do dpkg --remove --force-all $item ; done \n\nIt will remove the packages without any issues. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 and playing songs from cron I recently upgraded my computer to Ubuntu 14.04.\nAfter the upgrade the system no longer plays the few songs I had it play via crontab.\nThe crontab lines look like so:\n0 9   *   *   1-5       /usr/bin/mpg123 -q /home/user/Music/song.mp3\n\nI get no error from cron upon running the command.

I need this for example to checkout svn repo which is located under URL: https://svn.mydomain.com/. SSL Cert for mydomain is signed by my CA (ActiveDirectory). \nThere was a topic about Root CA installation and Ubuntu on Stack, and someone also said that 'old methods' don't work for him either (also Ubuntu 14.04).\n\nA: For me, placing a root CA certificate in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates and running update-ca-certificates works fine. This doesn't affect Firefox or Google Chrome, since they use their own certificate stores, but tools like wget work fine.\nAccording to man update-ca-certificates:\nIt reads the file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line gives a pathname\nof a CA certificate under  /usr/share/ca-certificates  that  should  be\ntrusted.  Lines that begin with \"#\" are comment lines and thus ignored.\nLines that begin with \"!\" are deselected, causing the  deactivation  of\nthe CA certificate in question. Certificates must have a .crt extension\nin order to be included by update-ca-certificates.\n\nFurthermore  all  certificates  with  a  .crt  extension  found   below\n/usr/local/share/ca-certificates   are   also  included  as  implicitly\ntrusted.\n\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu and drives partitioning I am shortly switching to ubuntu forever.

Everything worked fine and then I did a reboot.\nThen I got the following error (repeating endlessly) while Ubuntu was starting:\nincrementally starting raid arrays\nmdadm: Create user root not found \nmdadm: create group disk not found \n\nI rebooted the machine once again. Then a black screen was all i got (after selecting ubuntu from grub). I booted into recovery mode and selected resume - resume normal boot. Booting worked fine then. I did:\nmdadm --detail /dev/md126\n\nThe status shown was:\nState : clean, resyncing 1%\n\nSo I waited until resync was finished and rebooted.\nThis is where I came back to the error message I described at the beginning of this post. incrementally starting raid....\nI do not have any idea how to fix this. Anyone out there had similar problems or may help me somehow?\n\nA: md126 looks like a randomly made up md number that the recovery had put there, it's usually not the one in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\nWhen a kernel is updated, it runs update-initramfs and update-grub.\nThey grab the md? numbers from\n/proc/mdstat\n/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\n\nThe numbers there have to be the same for initrd to boot.\nAlso, check in these files to see that all the md? and UUID= numbers are the same...\n/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n/etc/fstab\n/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\n\n\nA: I had this problem before.\nWhat I did to avoid this error is to edit the grub config.\nPlease try to modify as \"nodmraid domdadm\" after the \"ro\" description, and see if it works.\n", "Q: Lost GUI after installed GTK.

Easiest way for you is to uninstall vlc by   \nsudo apt-get remove vlc\n", "Q: How to auto-login in Xubuntu or Ubuntu Server with XFCE? In spite of setting auto-login in the Xubuntu settings (XFCE/System/Users and Groups) I have to login each time when I start up the computer. How can this be changed?\n\nA: Type in a terminal (e.g. Xubuntu, Ubuntu Server with XCFE (e.g. Raspberry PI 3):\nsudo -e /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n(Better than sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf or sudo mousepad /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, see below the reasoning* - Thank you red_trumpet for the hint)\nAdd these lines to the file:\n\n[Seat:*]\nautologin-session=xubuntu\nautologin-user=YourDesiredAutoLoginUserName\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\nYou could use e.g. file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/autologin-xubuntu.conf, instead, but then you should make sure settings in another file in that directory or in file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf do not override it.\nFor GDM-Users\nThe config file is located /etc/gdm3/custom.conf (according to the other answer, please vote Arbuntu's answer up if you found it helpful):\nsudo -e /etc/gdm3/custom.conf\n\nUncomment the following lines (delete the #) and fill in your user name:\n# Enabling automatic login\n  AutomaticLoginEnable = true\n  AutomaticLogin = YourDesiredAutoLoginUserName\n\nExtra:\nTo remove password on resume, right-click the system tray power icon then Preferences. This brings up the XFCE power manager (Alternatively you can navigate to XFCE/Settings/Settings Manager/Power Manager). Click Extended in the left pane. Uncheck Lock screen when going for suspend/hibernate.\nThe last place is XFCE/System/Users and Groups. If it's set \"Password: Asked on login\" you can change it, and thereafter, if you logout or switch user, you can get back without entering password.\n*Reason for using sudo -e instead of the editor directly:\nsudo -e copies the file with user privileges, and opens it with your preferred editor. After saving, the file gets copied back to the original file. In this way, the editor does not obtain root privileges, which is a security improvement. (And if configured correctly, your preferred editor is chosen automatically, which is quite convenient).\nSources: lightdm/Read.me, Ubuntu Forum, SuperUser\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04 with Xubuntu Minimal Desktop\nOpen a terminal and paste this, it is the same route that you have put @phil294 in an answer above\nsudo nano /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/60-xubuntu.conf\n\nWe will find these lines\n[Seat:*]\nuser-session=xubuntu\n\nYou just have to paste this autologin with your username (in lowercase)\nautologin-user=username\n\nIt will look like this\n[Seat:*]\nuser-session=xubuntu\nautologin-user=username\n\nTo save in the nano editor\nCtrl + o ==> Enter\nTo exit the editor\nCtrl + x\nThe next time you log in, the LightDM window will no longer appear\n\nA: Click on Settings --> Users and Groups\n\nNext to Password, click on Change\n\nClick on Don't ask for password on login\n\n\nA: Things appear to have changed a bit since the accepted answer was written. Under Xubuntu 16.04 the settings have moved to\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nand they look like this\n[Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=gord\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\n\nA: After following @Filbuntu's answer, I had to do two more things to make this work.\nFirst, I thought the autologin-session parameter was just an alias name so I just put xubuntu, but turns out it should be a valid xsession name. You can see the ones available as files inside /usr/share/xsessions. The session name should be the filename without the .desktop part. In my case I had the following files inside /usr/share/xsessions:\n~$ ls -1 /usr/share/xsessions/\nubuntu.desktop\nxfce.desktop\n\nMy lightdm.conf file ended up like this:\n[Seat:*]\nautologin-session=xfce\nautologin-user=foobar\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\nThe second thing, I am not sure if it is required or not, but I looked in LightDM's logs (journalctl -u lightdm) and saw the following line:\npam_succeed_if(lightdm:auth): requirement \"user ingroup nopasswdlogin\" not met by user \"foo\"\n\nSo to fix it I added my user to this group:\nusermod -aG nopasswdlogin foo\n\nNow autologin works as expected.\n\nA: I'm using xubuntu with GDM so the config file is located below\n/etc/gdm3/custom.conf\n\nFind out below lines then uncomment them and fill out your user name\n# Enabling automatic login\n  AutomaticLoginEnable = true\n  AutomaticLogin = YourDesiredAutoLoginUserName\n\n\nA: Mine is a GUI answer to the Auto Login question.\nThe sequence is Settings/Details/Users.\nTo get into Settings, click in the top right corner of your screen.  A small box will open with three icons across the bottom.\nSettings is on the left, it resembles a mosquito but is actually a crossed wrench and screwdriver.\nWhen Settings opens you might be anywhere in the system.  Look at the top.  If it doesn't say Settings, click on the Left Arrow (<) in the top left of the screen.  That will take you to Settings.  Details is at the bottom of the left hand column.  Users is the third option down.  To make any changes you need to Unlock the screen by clicking on the Unlock button in the top right corner, enter your password to enable changes.  You can add Users, change the password, and turn Auto Login ON or Off.\n\nA: auto login is described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*official documentation  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM\n\n*How do I enable auto-login in LightDM?\n\nA: Not an answer to the question but related for folks in this thread: if you want to turn this OFF: make a backup of lightdm.conf, then change lightdm.conf to:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=\n\nWhy this can't be in the GUI, I don't know.\n", "Q: Just Loaded Trusty tahr where is the update manager I have just loaded Trusty Tahr but the update manager link in the far right dropdown menu (my previous version of Ubuntu (12.04) at least shows 'Software Up to Date' and looking in the dash screen it is not listed as an installed package.

I can press CTRL-ALT-F1, and get the command line, however then pressing CTRL-ALT-F7 does not bring up any sort of GUI. CTRL-ALT-F2...F6 bring various \"command line\" results.\nI have tried the NOMODESET option, as well as two other options from the F6 boot menu options which I found mentioned (sorry, cannot remember what they were).\nI appreciate that it's an old computer, but as far as I can see, it's within the specifications for Ubuntu - it used to run XP in its former life.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Try this answer below: by oli\n\nYou just need to turn the Unity plugin back on.

Got a message \"Ubuntu 14.04 internal error\" as well, but couldn't do a printscreen with the details. Another thing is that when I try to shut down and choose \"shut down\" in the upper-right corner menu, I never get a usual \"restart/shut down\" window, but \"lock/log off\" instead. \nAny ideas, what it can be? \nps. I've already checked display settings and there is only one built-in display. \n\nA: First, enter a console as it seems you can't really do much with your current setup.\nTo do this type CtrlAltF1.\nYou should now have a login prompt that looks somewhat like this: \nUbuntu (some version number) (computer name) TTY1\n\n(computer name) login:\n\nNow type your username, press enter, type your password, and press enter again. If all goes well, you should have a logged in terminal session.\nI don't fully know what's wrong with your installation but I guess it has something to do with your configuration files. (If you could get some more information out of the error dialog ie what package crashed that would help a lot)\nCorrupted Configuration Files:\nTo remedy (in terminal) type these commands\nmkdir oldconfigs #create a directory to hold all the possibly corrupted configuration files\nmv .* oldconfigs #move all configuration files to the oldconfigs directory.\nsudo reboot now # reboot the computer\n\nIf you need to restore some of these configuration files later, they will still be safe in the oldconfigs directory.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem.

It is incorrect that you need \"allow in on tun0\" to receive return packets. You only want to receive connections you asked for, versus allowing the whole world to connect to you. Allowing out will do this. Test out the proposed configuration below and see.\nHere is an example for a series of UFW commands for use with a firewall:\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw --force reset\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw default deny outgoing\nsudo ufw allow out on tun0\nsudo ufw allow out on eth0 to any port 53,1197 proto udp\nsudo ufw allow out on wlan0 to any port 53,1197 proto udp\nsudo ufw status verbose\n\nExample Result:\nStatus: active\nLogging: on (low)\nDefault: deny (incoming), deny (outgoing), disabled (routed)\nNew profiles: skip\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\nAnywhere                   ALLOW OUT   Anywhere on tun0          \n53,1197/udp                ALLOW OUT   Anywhere on eth0\n53,1197/udp                ALLOW OUT   Anywhere on wlan0\nAnywhere (v6)              ALLOW OUT   Anywhere (v6) on tun0\n53,1197/udp (v6)           ALLOW OUT   Anywhere (v6) on eth0\n53,1197/udp (v6)           ALLOW OUT   Anywhere (v6) on wlan0\n\nNOTE: \n-Your interfaces may be different, for example ubuntu 16.12 uses eno1 and wlp3s0b1. Use command \"ifconfig\" to see your actual interfaces. \n-1197 UDP is fairly default, but you may need to change it for your VPN (e.g. 443 TCP).\n-I usually delete ipv6 (sudo ufw delete 4, repeat x3)\nWhat this does: \n-It allows outbound connections through the VPN tunnel, while blocking everything but the VPN tunnel and DNS connections on ethernet/wifi. Warning below on the DNS issue.\nWarning: \nThis example allow out on 53 for DNS requests so that openvpn (e.g. vpn.somevpnprovider.com) can request the IP address and make a connection. The trade off is the potential for DNS leakage. Use dnsleaktest.com to ensure your VPN settings tunnel your DNS requests. For the cautious/paranoid, skip allowing out on 53 and instead toggle your firewall off to connect, then back on once connected. For my VPN reasons, I choose not to do that since it's more likely I'll forget the firewall entirely (e.g. DNS will leak anyway if openvpn is misconfigured).\n", "Q: Is it possible to use hand cursor in evince?

I am newbie in using git. I need to pull some packages from my friend's git repository but there is no Internet connection in my computer. I need to pull them offline.

You could copy his entire repository to a USB stick (make sure you copy all the hidden .git* files!) and access it that way. You can also set up network share and get access that way...\nOnce you have access to his repository its very easy to pull his changes into your repository (using a terminal):\ncd \"<your repo directory>\"\ngit pull \"<his repo directory>\" \"<branch>\"\n\nWhere <your repo directory> is the path of your location git repository, <his repo directory> is the file path of his repository and <branch> is the branch you are trying to pull (you can see a list of branches using git branch; the branch marked with the star is your current branch).\nIn practice it could look like this:\ncd \"${HOME}/project\"\ngit pull \"/media/john/USB/repo\" \"master\"\n\nIn other words: You can check out a repository from an offline source just as you would when using a server!\n\nA: You obviously can't access a Git repository on the internet without internet access. You can however clone the repository to a portable medium (e. g. with a Git environment for Windows in an internet café) and copy/move/clone it to your computer afterwards.\nPlease note that you can clone repositories from a local file system or a resource on a local area network, not just the internet, e. g.:\ngit clone /path/to/source-repository /another/path/to/destination-repository\n\nGit GUIs usually allow you to do the same.\n", "Q: Do I have to compile SDL2_mixer myself?

Maybe you've moved on, or found the answer ?\nAnyway, I'm currently around those part myself. I haven't broken through yet, and would be delighted to hear from somewhat who has.\nFrom what I gather, a lot of issues revolve around the question wether the X11 server is listening to TCP on port 6000. Answers vary with flavors and versions of Ubuntu, specially which display manager is in use : Lightdm for Xubuntu and newer versions of plain Ubuntu vs. Gdm for older Ubuntu and of course Ubuntu Gnome, and on top of that there may be a bug in recent versions of Gnome that block it no matter what.\nOf course, other than that, you also need to adjust xauth\nNow, from your command lines above, I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to achieve. One computer is supposed to be the local master and the other the remote slave, even if they are obviously next to each other.\nHere, it seems that your laptlop is the local master, and your desktop the remote slave. Fine.\nSo you're lauching the X11 server on desktop, which is fine as long as there is not already a X11 server running there.\nBut where are the displays you expect something to happen on ? One has not ip address, the other's is localhost, so both are local, which means remote, seeing that you've just SSHed in to the (remote) desktop.\nAlso note that X11 terminology is a bit confusing. The 'server' is the machine where the screen is attached to, whereas the 'client' is the one doing the heavy lifting and passing the results to be displayed.\nHope this helps someone somehow ...\n", "Q: Cron jobs are disabled on clean installation of 14.04 I have a clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 and in my /etc/cron.daily/ I see *.disabled files:\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 15481 Apr 10 09:04 apt.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   314 Feb 17  2014 aptitude.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   355 Jun  4  2013 bsdmainutils.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   384 Mar 23  2014 cracklib-runtime.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   256 May  1 08:29 dpkg.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   372 Jan 22  2014 logrotate\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  1261 Apr 10 06:59 man-db.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   435 Jun 20  2013 mlocate.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   249 Feb 16  2014 passwd.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   349 Dec 27  2012 quota.disabled\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   322 Apr 11 17:58 upstart.disabled\n\nWhy is this happening? I want to use unattended-upgrades on my box, but documentation for unattended-upgrades indicates I need to edit /etc/cron.daily/apt file. According to this link I believe that file should exist by default: http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-14.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/apt_1.0.1ubuntu2_amd64.deb.html (and not apt.disabled?)\n\nA: We encounter the same problem with one VPS server which is hosted at a provider using OpenVZ (https://openvz.org). Another server with fresh 14.04 install (hosted elsewhere) has all cron jobs enabled.\nMy best guess is that it is a try of the provider to save some system resources.\n\nA: Further to Ikar's answer, we have also seen this on a VPS provider using https://openvz.org/. \nWe addressed it by running this bash script:\nfor script in $(find /etc/cron.* -type f -name '*.disabled' ! -name '.placeholder*')\ndo\n    mv \"$script\" \"$(dirname $script)/$(basename $script .disabled)\"\ndone\n\nwhich simply strips all the \".disabled\" off the standard cron scripts provided by the VPS host. \n\nA: We've also seen this on OpenVZ VMs running Debian. The OpenVZ provided templates/images have all cronjobs from /etc/cron.* disabled by default.\nI have no clue why they did that, but it seems that this issue is caused by the template/image used and has nothing to do with any particular VPS provider.\n", "Q: I need to change the Read Only in gedit to Read/Write I am BRAND new to Ubuntu.\nI just installed it along with Win7 as dual-boot.

I have done this from the terminal with\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nI then entered my password and got the gedit screen with the grub file on it.  I then changed the timeout from 10 to 0.  Now I find that gedit is marked as [Read-Only].\nHow can I save my file?\n\nA: To edit configuration files, I would always use in your place a text-based editor:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub \n\n\nA: gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub is indeed the correct answer to your question, however, if you're brand new to Ubuntu, I'd advise you to install Grub Customiser.\nGrub Customiser allows you to change a ton of parameters in grub without the risk of you making a fatal mistake. ;-) (Fatal to Ubuntu, not to you!)\nIn a terminal type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer \n\nand then in the dash type: \"Grub Cu\" to open it…\n", "Q: How to command grep not to display the searched string? I want to print a part of a line in a file. The whole line looks like this. \nPath=fy2tbaj8.default-1404984419419\n\nI want to print only the characters after Path=. I have tried grep Path filename | head -5. But its not working.It still shows the entire line. How can i do this?\n\nA: The awk solution is what I would use, but a slightly smaller process to launch is sed and it can produce the same results, but by substituting the PATH= part of the line with \"\" , i.e.\n  sed -n 's/^Path=//p' file\n\nThe -n overrides seds default behavior of 'print all lines' (so -n = no print), \nand to print a line, we add the p character after the substition. Only lines where the substitution happens will be printed. \nThis gives you the behavior you have asked for, of greping for a string, but removing the Path= part of the line.\nIf, per David Foerster's comments, you have a large file and wish to stop processing as soon as you have matched and printed the first match to 'Path=', you can tell sed to quit, with the q command. Note that you need to make it a command-group by surrounding both in { ..} and separating each command with a ;. So the enhanced command is\nsed -n 's/^Path=//{p;q;}` file\n\nIHTH\n\nA: grep greps a line of text and displays it. head displays the first n lines of text, not characters.\nYou're looking for sed or awk:\nawk '{print $2}' FS='='\n\nThis sets = as a field separator and prints the second field.\n\nA: With GNU grep:\n$ echo Path=fy2tbaj8.default-1404984419419 | grep -oP '(Path=)\\K.*'\nfy2tbaj8.default-1404984419419\n\n\\K keeps the stuff left of the \\K, don't include it in $&.\n\nA: You can use grep and just grep:\ngrep -oP \"(?<=Path=).*\" file\n\n\nExplanation:\nFrom man grep:\n   -o, --only-matching\n          Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line,\n          with each such part on a separate output line.\n   -P, --perl-regexp\n          Interpret PATTERN as a Perl compatible regular expression (PCRE)\n\nThe lookbehind (?<=Path=) asserts that at the current position in the string, what precedes is the characters Path=. If the assertion succeeds, the engine matches the resolution pattern.\nFor Perl 5 regular expression syntax, read the Perl regular expressions man page.\n\nA: you can use cut command for this purpose.\ngrep Path filename |cut -c6-\n\nHere -c6- option means print from 6th to last character.\n\nA: Of course the solution is to use grep -Po.\nLet's add some other solutions, for completeness:\n\n\n*\n\n*with cut, setting the delimiter the =:\ncut -d'=' -f2 file\n\n\n*It might be a bit risky, but you can also source the file, so that $Path will contain the value.\nsource file\necho \"$Path\"\n\nTest\n$ cat a\nthis=aaabbccc\nthat=dddeee\n$ source a\n$ echo \"$this\"\naaabbccc\n$ echo \"$that\"\ndddeee\n\n\nAs per comments, see how to source just part of the file:\n$ cat a\nPath=22\nPath=33\n$ source a\n$ echo $Path\n33\n$ source <(head -1 a)\n$ echo $Path\n22\n\n", "Q: Wiping Windows 7 with Ubuntu 14.04 installed Is it possible for me to wipe my Windows 7 partition (and then re-install W7)?? I already have 14.04 installed and whilst I still want to have Windows on my machine, I have all my data backed up and I no longer need the data on the Windows partition. Is this doable?\nThanks!\n\nA: If all you want to do is delete your \"data\" (files, pictures, etc), then just do a meticulous cleanup of the folders in which W7 keeps this stuff (My Documents, My Pictures, etc). This will allow u to keep your current W7 installation (and all updates). If you wipe-out (re-format the W7 partition), and then re-install Windows 7, the Windows 7 installation process will MOST CERTAINLY wipe out grub2 bootloader and install the W7 bootloader in it's place. This is not a disaster and can be fixed fairly easily by booting to a Ubuntu live CD and re-installing grub2.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation (space issue) I am installing Ubuntu with my pre installed Windows 8.1.\nI am confused about disk space.I want to install ubuntu in 50GB partition.How much memory should i assign to Swap, Home, and ubuntu installation.\nI am not going to store pictures, movies or other files in my home directory.I am going to use Ubuntu for Programming purpose only, Specially for Ruby on Rails.I will install lot of programs in Ubuntu like Rubymine, Git, RoR etc.\nMy RAM is 2GB and I have dual core processor \nPlease suggest me memory size for each partition as i am new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*50 GB ought to be enough for Ubuntu itself. I gave it a combined 25 GB (/, /boot, /usr and /var), which is far more than necessary even though I would consider myself a power user (with multiple IDEs, a DBMS, a web server and a VM environment).\n\n*The size of your /home partition depends on your needs and is the same you would expect for the same kind of data on Windows (plus games if you want to use the default storage location of Steam, because that's on /home by default).\n\n\nIt is possible and relatively safe to change the size and layout of existing partitions with tools like (G)Parted, if your needs turn out to be different at some point.\n\nA: Fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit take less than 5 GB. Just in case I will set about 2GB on swap partition (because you have minimal recommended memory for 64 bit system). In most cases application installs in e.g /user/lib not in home folder. This folder purpose is to hold your configuration data, cache files, documents, music, video etc. For programming purpose only I will consider not to have home partition at all and set something about 30 GB for all.\n", "Q: Listing and removing albums with too small audio bitrate I'm cleaning my music library and got stuck with getting rid of thousands of albums with bitrate <320kbps which gathered there for years. Checking single files bitrate and deleting whole folder by hand is realy tedious. Maybe someone here can come up with some idea which would help me with cleanup? I'd like to have after that only MP3s@320kbps and flacs. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Here's a shell approach. It will delete any directories that don't contain .mp3 files of the >= 320 kbps bitrate:\nfind /path/to/Music -type d -print0 | \n    while IFS= read -r -d '' dir; do \n     mp3=$(find \"$dir\" -type f -iname '*.mp3' | head -n 1); \n     [ -e \"$mp3\" ] && [[ $(mp3info -x \"$mp3\" | grep -oP '\\d+(?=\\s*kbps)') -lt 320 ]] && \n            rm -rf \"$(dirname \"$mp3\")\"; \n    done\n\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*This will remove any directories that contain at least one mp3 file with a bitrate less than 320. If another file exists in the same directory with the right bitrate, that will be deleted as well. This approach assumes that all files in a directory have the same bitrate.\n\n\n*This will miss files of variable bitrate.\n\n\n*It should work with any type of file name, including those with spaces, newlines or even backslashes.\n\n\n*You might need to install mp3info: sudo apt-get install mp3info\n\n\n*Run it on a test directory first.\nExplanation\n\n*\n\n*find /path/to/Music -type d -print0 :  find all directories under /path/to/Music and print them separated by the null string. This is needed to deal with strange file names.\n\n\n*while IFS= read -r -d '' dir; do : go through each of the results of find, saving them in the $dir variable.\n\n\n*mp3=$(find \"$dir\" -type f -iname '*.mp3' | head -n 1);  : save the name of the first mp3 file in this directory as $mp3.\n\n\n*[ -e \"$mp3\" ]  : if this file exists. This is needed for skipping directories with no mp3 files.\n\n\n*[[ $(mp3info -x \"$mp3\" | grep -oP '\\d+(?=\\s*kbps)') -lt 320 ]] : this checks the bitrate of $mp3. It runs mp3info, greps the bitrate and checks if it is less than 320.\n\n\n*rm -rf \"$(dirname \"$mp3\")\";  : delete the directory that contains the mp3 file. This will only be run if its bitrate is less than desired.\n\nA: From @DavidFoerster's comment I would use Banshee.\nImport all your media files from the folder's (or even whole partitions) you want by going to media->import media and choose folders.\nOnce all your media has been imported, right click on the column bar (shown below in the screenshot) and select Bitrate. Then click on the column name to order by that column.\nYou can then select the Bitrate you want (in your case 320) scroll down, press Shift and click the last song.

The marked fix works well for getting basic stylus functionality going, but in some cases it does not enable the stylus button (so no right click), and it does not enable the buttons on the pad or the touchpad functionality.\nA reply on the bug report claims to have gotten full functionality, including touchpad, by editing /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-wacom.conf to add MatchIsTablet:\nMatchProduct \"Wacom|WACOM|Hanwang|PTK-540WL|ISD-V4\"\nMatchIsTablet \"on\"\n\nI haven't had success with it myself but it might make a difference for others depending on configuration.\n\nA: What I finally wound up doing was to create a UNetbootin Live USB Flash Drive from an older Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS Desktop ISO which I had made back in 2013. And installed from that. In that Older Ubuntu kernel incarnation, the Wacom Bamboo Pen Tablet was still recognized. so that I could set its 'System Settings' Tablet GUI to set the Mouse Emulation Mode and Reassign the Stylus Key functions. I then still needed to implement Mouse Pointer Acceleration in order to obtain correct Tablet functioning., But that older hardware function is also disabled in newer incarnations of Ubuntu, even in 14.04.01. So, because xorg commands which are entered from 'Terminal' are not retained on reboot. I added an xset entry to Startup Applications from the ('Console' located at the Top of the Unity bar) ' xset m 6 1 ' And labeled that MouseAcceleration. (m indicates Mouse, and the first number 6 being the acceleration factor). After this and other System Settings had been completed, I then installed the Ubuntu Updates to bring the older Kernel up to speed.\nPrevious to this on a 14.05.5 Live USB with Persistence, I tried the steps outlined above, but no joy. Steps 1 through 5 could not be retained because sudo update-grub only returned could not write to /cow\nand the ' gksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-wacom.conf ' option, only returned an entry list which was already precisely the same as the referenced list.\nIt was at this point that I decided to go with what I wound up doing.\nAs a previous Windows user, what initially sold me on giving Ubuntu Linux a try to begin with, was Leo Lapport (a few years back) on his The Tech Guy radio program stating that Linux and especially Ubuntu Linux had retained Native Drivers for Older computer hardware in their Kernels. Making it possible for the disadvantaged to get some useful life out of older and outdated computers that would otherwise be junked. In that respect, its very sad to see them now stripping out so much native support for the older drivers.\n", "Q: How to make a bootable USB on Mac? Hope you guys are doing well.

It's not always failsafe, though.\nIf lsusb shows an entry for the device (and it is identified correctly), the kernel is detecting it, fixing one part of the problem.\nIf /dev shows an entry for it (in this case, /dev/video* (replace * with a number)), then it is exposed to the system and ready to use.\nIn your case, as determined by chat, your card is just not compatible. The system detects it and makes it ready, but no program can read it. It sounds like a propritrary communication codec, kind of like what those one-time camcorders have.\nElgato is not compatible with Linux (even with custom drivers), so this is sadly a dead cause.\n\nYou can use a standard Sony camcorder as a pass-through device.\nHook up the RCA cables to the connector jack, and a DV cord to the DV port.\nSe the camera to VTR mode and change the \"RCA > Digial\" mode in the camera menu to ON.\n", "Q: Why am I getting a mkdir error with this sudo mkdir /var/www/magento-dev.local/public command?

Currently 4.8.2 and 4.9.1 are installed. I downloaded an 4.8.1 from here http://gcc.cybermirror.org/releases/gcc-4.8.1/ . After extracting the files I did a ./configure and then tried make. At the end of make, I get this error \n/usr/include/linux/errno.h:1:23: fatal error: asm/errno.h: No such file or directory\n #include <asm/errno.h>\n\nI am new to linux so I do not know how to find or add this header file.\nEdit: Steps I made:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract gcc-4.8.1.tar.gz to a folder\n\n*Open terminal window\n\n*cd gcc-4.8.1\n\n*./configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu\n\n*make -j4\nI don't know what I did differently but it finally compiled.

I'm doing this in a virtual machine, which I can recreate by running a simple script, and that is why it's no big deal if I break something.\n\nA: The asm/errno.h header is provided by a variety of packages. Odd that gcc would require it, but you can try:\nsudo apt-get install linux-libc-dev\n\nYou also need to tell GCC to look for an architecture and OS specific location for the headers:\n../configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu \n\n(or i386-linux-gnu for 32-bit Ubuntu).\n\nIt's highly recommended when building stuff from source that you use --prefix flag (and with GCC, the --program-suffix flag) while configuring. Since you haven't, try running /usr/bin/gcc.\nThus:\ntar xf gcc-4.8.1.tar.gz \nmkdir gcc\ncd gcc\n../gcc-4.8.1/configure  --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --prefix=/usr/local --program-suffix=-4.8.1\nmake -j\nsudo make install\n\nNow your GCC binaries will be installed to /usr/local/bin/, and other things in other folders in /usr/local.\nFor example:\n$ /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.8.1  # or simply gcc-4.8.1, since this folder is in your PATH\n\nNote how I'm running configure and make from a different directory, outside of where the GCC source is? That's how the GCC docs recommend that GCC be built.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 14.04 keep shutting down when playing video? I'm reasonably tech savvy but very new to Ubuntu and I'm having a problem when watching video.\nI can watch something for 15 minutes or so whether it be flash based or MP4 or something then Ubuntu just freezes for around 20 seconds then restarts. My system config is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*i5-760 @ 2.8Ghz (stock)\n\n*1x4GB Corsair Vengeance LP 1600Mhz\n\n*ASRock P55 Deluxe\n\n*Palit GTX 460 1GB @ stock (around 700Mhz I think)\n\n*128GB Crucial M4\n\n*500GB Hard drive, think it's a Samsung\n\n*Seasonic X-560 560W PSU\n\n\nSoftware is Ubuntu 14.04, VLC Media Player, Mozilla Firefox, BBC iPlayer and the 'videos' app.\n\n\n*\n\n*First I thought it might be overheating so I've checked my temps when playing video and it only gets to around 45-50c for the CPU and around 50-55c for the GPU. That's actually quite good so that can't be the problem.\n\n*Next I thought it may be a driver issue but I've downloaded the latest driver from Nvidia and I'm still having issues. I'm on version 304.123. Are there any alternative drivers I should be looking at?\n\n*Next I thought it could be a problem with my media or media player but I've tried different types of media in different media players and they all have the same issue. I used to run this PC in Windows for years and never had this issue so it's probably not a hardware problem.\n\n*Beyond that, I don't really know what to check. My motherboard or graphics card could have compatibility problems with Ubuntu but I don't think that's likely. This sort of thing can sometimes be a problem with the PSU as well but although this one is around 3 years old, it is really good quality and has plenty of power for my components.\nThe only thing I can see from the system log that looks like an error from the time of the crash is:\nSep 29 20:05:11 james-pc gnome-session[1293]: GLib-CRITICAL: g_environ_setenv: assertion 'value != NULL' failed\n\nAny ideas on what to try next? Thanks in advance!\nUPDATE: I've tried a memtest as well for 9 hours straight and it picked up no errors. I've also found that this doesn't just happen with video. It has happened a couple of times with games as well and even once or twice when i've just opened the software centre. Any other ideas? :(\nUPDATE 2: Another error I have now seen is:\n [1412198417.432596] [nm-dns-dnsmasq.c:396] update(): dnsmasq owner not found on bus: Could not get owner of name \nand\nkernel: [    6.990059] init: plymouth-splash main process (1140) terminated with status 1\n\nA: Try checking the Brightness & Lock in the System Settings, it sounds like it is set to 15 minutes, if there is no key or mouse/touch pad movement detected after 15 minutes the screen will go into \"sleep mode\" usually blanking the display. You can set it a suitable time-out so it doesn't occur too early or turn it off. It applies what ever program is running so it will happen if you are watching a film or video longer than the time-out time.\n", "Q: Shotwell crop-dialog has disappeared A while ago, I moved the crop-dialog (where you can edit what dimensions you want the crop to be), probably almost out of my screen. Now, whenever I press the crop-button, the dialog is nowhere to be seen, it has disappeared. Is there a way to solve this?\n\nA: I had the same, resetting the crop settings that Shotwell remembers with gsettings fixed it for me:\ngsettings reset-recursively org.yorba.shotwell.crop-settings\n\n\nA: I just logged a similar issue as https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/shotwell/issues/136.  As I commented on user70550's answer, gsettings reset-recursively org.yorba.shotwell.crop-settings\n seemed to work initially to solve my problem, but then did not work consistently when reproducing the issue so that I could log it.\nWhat did work consistently on my kubuntu 18.04 system was to reposition the Shotwell window, after which the crop dialog would pop to the front.\nNote: sometimes the crop dialog was in a top corner of my display (sometimes far from the Shotwell window) and sometimes the crop dialog appeared over the image itself. \n", "Q: Are Open Source graphics drivers better than proprietary drivers in certain applications? I have an elderly laptop with a GeForce 9300M graphics chip. I don't game on it, but I want a smooth desktop experience with Unity. In my situation specifically, are the open source drivers better than the proprietary Nvidia ones? Or is the only reason for the open source drivers to exist them being open source?\nI'm also writing OpenCL applications. Can I use my GeForces stream processors for OpenCL with the  open source drivers?\nUpdate: by better, I mean in terms of reliability, energy efficiency and performance on the Desktop, in GPU computing, and out of curiosity also in gaming.\n\nA: Most of the open source drivers you'll find may produce better graphical output than the proprietary do. Sometimes you won't even notice a difference. And sometimes an open source driver works much worse than the proprietary one. I will not make a general recommendation on which to use, but here are some cases, in which certain drivers are better than others:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a nVidia card with Optimus, you should install the open source driver from the Bumblebee Project. This is the only driver supporting Optimus on Linux. you should either install the open source driver from the Bumblebee Project, or any nVidia proprietary driver, but not the Xorg driver, as it currently doesn't support discrete graphics.\n\n*If you want to use CUDA (nVidia's stuff for executing functions on the GPU), you should use the proprietary driver.\n\n*If you want to use OpenCL (something like CUDA, developed by Khronos), you have to use the proprietary driver.\n\n\nIf none of these applies to you, it's up to you which driver you use. If you don't have any problems with the current driver, I wouldn't change it. You never know whether another one will even work at all. However, if you want to take the risk, try the drivers suggested in Software & Updates → Additional Drivers and find out which one works best.\n\nA: My understanding is that the nVidia drivers are significantly better at 3D acceleration and shading, but are about the same as the open source drivers for 2D applications.\nSee this comparison for some concrete benchmarks.  Proprietary (usually) beats open source in terms of performance.  That being said, upgrading is significantly easier and more streamlined using the open source.\nSee the nouveau Feature Matrix for more specific information (your card would use the \"NV50\" family of drivers).  According to that table, OpenCL support for your card is \"Stalled\".\n", "Q: Removing almost all applications from Ubuntu, Ubuntu customization kit Hello fellow Ubuntu users,\nI am currently creating my own Ubuntu distro using the Ubuntu customization Kit and everything is going pretty smoothly so far other than a couple minor set backs.\nI have created my own Iso and what I need to do is strip most software from the image, except for a browser. Now I have researched minimal ubuntu/linux images but most of them don't work with the customization kit or I can't get the remastering to work correctly. So I have ended up starting to remove all the unwanted applications and I was wondering if anyone out there has a script that strips the Image of almost all applications other than key software and the Mozilla browser. Even possibly not allow the user to navigate the options menu or file system.\nOne of the things I am mostly trying to do is get this image down to about less than 600mb of space you I can put it on a CD and have it boot straight to the desktop on the live cd.\nSo more or less what I am asking for is a script to just remove a lot of the software from the image, if this exists, where can I find it because it would make life a lot easier. Otherwise I will continue writing down all the software and starting removing it from the Iso before creation.\nThank you for taking the time to read this (I know its a block of text) and I look forward to some responses.\n\nA: You could try Customizer:\nhttps://github.com/clearkimura/Customizer/wiki/FAQ\nI have used it with great success to make a customised boot flash drive containing my favourite disaster recovery tools.\nWhile I used it to add more packages to my customised image it can equally be used to remove packages. This is because one drops into a window where one uses apt-get to add or remove packages. In your case you would use apt-get to remove unwanted packages. This has the advantage that all dependencies are properly preserved.\nWhen you start Customizer you choose a boot image. It is preferable to start with the one provided by Ubuntu. I use Unetbootin to transfer the newly created .iso file to a flash drive\n", "Q: Computer automatically disconnects from wifi: I have to restart to get back online My Lenovo Ideapad G50-70 will automatically disconnect from the Internet at random moments on 14.04.

In particular I have an sd.c file like the following:\n[...]\n#include \"hw/mydistribution.h\"\n[...]\nNac = poisson_distribution(Nac_mean);\n\nand a mydistribution.h file where for example I define the poisson_distribution() using functions from GSL library:\n#include <math.h>\n#include <gsl/gsl_rng.h>\n#include <gsl/gsl_randist.h>\n[...]\nunsigned int poisson_distribution(double expected_value) {\n\nconst gsl_rng_type * T;\ngsl_rng * r;\nunsigned int k;\n\ngsl_rng_env_setup();\nT = gsl_rng_default;\nr = gsl_rng_alloc (T);\nk = gsl_ran_poisson (r, expected_value);\ngsl_rng_free (r);\n\nreturn k;\n}\n\nNow, I know that if I had all the aforementioned parts in the same file [e.g. myfile.c] I could compile from terminal using:\ngcc myfile.c -o myfile -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\n\nand it works because I tried. But how to ask to QEMU Makefile to do this? honestly this Makefile seems too complex for my entry level. I googled info about makefiles and after reading I thought to find in QEMU Makefile something like:\nLDLIBS := -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\n[...]\n$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)\n\nbut searching for the real QEMU Makefile implementation I found the rules.mak file where:\n%.o: %.c\n    $(call quiet-command,$(CC) $(QEMU_INCLUDES) $(QEMU_CFLAGS) $(QEMU_DGFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $($@-cflags) -c -o $@ $<,\"  CC    $(TARGET_DIR)$@\")\n\nMaybe this is the line to tweak. The question is: how to tweak? I tried to edit this line as:\n%.o: %.c\n    $(call quiet-command,$(CC) $(QEMU_INCLUDES) $(QEMU_CFLAGS) $(QEMU_DGFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $($@-cflags) -c -o $@ $< -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm,\"  CC    $(TARGET_DIR)$@\")\n\nbut it didn't work and I got the following errors\nubuntu@ubuntu:~/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0$ make\n  GEN   config-host.h\n  GEN   trace/generated-tracers.h\n  GEN   trace/generated-tracers.c\n  GEN   arm-softmmu/config-target.h\n  LINK  arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm\n../hw/sd/sd.o: In function `poisson_distribution':\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1630: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_env_setup'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1632: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_default'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1633: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_alloc'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1641: undefined reference to `gsl_ran_poisson'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1646: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_free'\n../hw/sd/sd.o: In function `weibull_distribution':\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1676: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_env_setup'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1678: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_default'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1679: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_alloc'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1687: undefined reference to `gsl_ran_weibull'\n/home/ubuntu/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0/include/hw/mycard.h:1692: undefined reference to `gsl_rng_free'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[1]: *** [qemu-system-arm] Error 1\nmake: *** [subdir-arm-softmmu] Error 2\n\nAnd after all I think it would not be a perfect solution since the other files don't need GSL library and there's no need to apply -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm to every .c file. I would like to create a new Makefile where all the other files continue to be compiled like the original Makefile but when it comes to sd.c I would like it to be compiled as said before in order to avoid undefined references\nThanks in advance to the persons that will give me precise suggestions to help me fix this issue\n\nA: Above this wildcard line:\n%.o: %.c\n\nadd a specific rule for the particular file:\nmyfile.o: myfile.c\n    gcc -c -o $@ $< -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\n\n\nA: I think after days of doubts, researches, manuals and so on I finally solved my problem and I want to share my efforts with you\nAfter steeldriver comment I began to watch more closely the linking phase. The solution I found was adding the following lines to configure file just before the analogue librt section:\n##########################################\n# Do we need libgsl0-dev\ncat > $TMPC << EOF\n#include <gsl/gsl_rng.h>\n#include <gsl/gsl_randist.h>\nint main(void) { return (int) gsl_ran_weibull_pdf (11, 10, 5); }\nEOF\nif compile_prog \"\" \"\" ; then\n  :\nelif compile_prog \"\" \"-lgsl -lgslcblas\" ; then\n  LIBS=\"-lgsl -lgslcblas $LIBS\"\n  libs_qga=\"-lgsl -lgslcblas $libs_qga\"\nelse\n  error_exit \"libgsl0-dev check failed\"\nfi\n\nthe purpose of gsl_ran_weibull_pdf (11, 10, 5) is verifying the presence of libgsl0-dev. If we have it than when we find -lgsl -lgslcblas we can correctly interpretate them, else the user will be informed about the absence of this library\nNow when I type:\n    ubuntu@ubuntu:~/Desktop/qemu-2.1.0$ make\nthere are no more undefined references:\n  GEN   config-host.h\n  GEN   trace/generated-tracers.h\n  GEN   trace/generated-tracers.c\n  CC    hw/sd/sd.o\n  GEN   arm-softmmu/config-target.h\n  LINK  arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm\n  GEN   arm-linux-user/config-target.h\n\nI'm sure this solution can be further refined and I'm open to new suggestions, if any. But I admit to be already extremely happy in finding this result\nSpecial thanks to @muru and @steeldriver for their support\n", "Q: Wireless connection doesn't work So that's all, my wireless connection in Ubuntu doesn't work, how can I fix it??

I set the system up using Zentyal 3.4 of which Windows and Ubuntu clients both connect. Students have their own personal logins with their personal \"Server Drive\" of 500Mb space on the server. These \"Server Drives\" are the users' home folders (ie, user john.smith server drive is under /home/john.smith).\nI have had multiple problems with the permissions before. By mixing ubuntu's drwxrwxrwx permission system and Zentyal's ACLs, I managed to get all administrators access to the users files by creating a symlink to the home folder that only admins have permission to. I used the Zentyal File Sharing (Samba) to add this to Samba, and it worked for a while. (/userfiles is symlink to /home that only admins can access. I do this because Samba will mess up if I create a share with /home since that is what the users are using when they get their Server Drive, duplicate samba entries I guess).\nEach user's home folder is owned by them as the user but owned by Administrators as the group. Perms are set to 770 for all of them, including any sub-folders, the typical user's folder will look as follows:\ndrwsrws---  4 john.smith    Administrators  4096 Aug 15 16:02 john.smith/\n\nThe users can access all their files, and the admins can access their files as well. The problem comes when the users create their own personal folders. In /etc/skel, the users start with a Documents and a Pictures folder. Anything in here (not including subfolders) is readable by any admin. If a user creates a personal folder anywhere (ie /home/john.smith/Computer Class), admins can't read it.\nI have tried fixing the problem by doing:\nfor line in `ls -1`\n    do chown $line:Administrators $line -R\n    chmod 770 $line -R\ndone\n\nThis basically sets the permissions of all folders and files to that seen above. It still doesn't work. I've also tried doing:\nsetfacl -b john.smith\n\nStill nothing. There is no difference between ACL and ubuntu's permission system results of the Documents or Pictures folder (readable) and the users' personally created folders (non-readable). What am I doing wrong here? Any suggestions to clean up this mess? How can I get these permission to how I need them to be? \n\nA: I have only a little Ubuntu experience, and less Zentyal experience, but I had a similar issue today. I was restoring files from an old Ubuntu/Samba fileserver to a new Ubuntu/Zentyal fileserver. I set/updated ACLs, used my administrator:adm ownership, but could not browse on a windows client. I then did a chown shareuser:sharegroup (a user/group that actually needed the files) and it worked fine. Maybe that's obvious or redundant in your case, but on the outside chance it could help, I'm posting.\n", "Q: HP envy 15, Boot from usb I'm trying to boot a live usb from an HP envy 15 but I can' seem to do it.\nI have already entered the bios setup, disabled secure boot, enabled legacy support.\nBut, the bios sasys that when legacy support is enabled, uefi devices will take precedence over legacy ones.\nSo when booting, I want to boot in legacy mode form the usb, but instead a pseuo-file manager appears looking for a eif file to boot from.\nAm I missing something?

After this, begin the installation process.\nWhen the installation arrives at this screen (GUI updated in recent version but info still the same)\n\nSelect Something else\nNow, on the next screen\nSelect the appropriate drive, (the one with 120GB which equates to roughly \n122880MB)\nSelect it and create new partition table (option in the bottom left)\n\n(Continuation...)\nBIOS-Boot or EFI partition (required on GPT disks)\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on a GPT disk (you can check it via the 'sudo parted -l' command as mentioned above), you will need either an EFI partition (if your BIOS is set up in EFI mode) or a BIOS-Boot partition (if your BIOS is set up in Legacy mode).\nBIOS-Boot partition:\nMount point: none\nType: no filesystem\nDescription: the BIOS-boot partition contains GRUB 2's core. It is necessary if you install Ubuntu on a GPT disk, and if the firmware (BIOS) is set up in Legacy (not EFI) mode. It must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and have a \"bios_grub\" flag.\nSize: 1MB. \nEFI partition:\nMount point: /boot/efi (no need to set up this mount point as the installer will do it automatically)\nType: FAT (generally FAT32)\nDescription: the EFI partition (also called ESP) contains some boot files. It is necessary if the firmware (BIOS) is set up to boot the HDD in EFI mode (which is default on more and more modern, > year 2011 computers). It must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and have a \"boot\" flag.\nSize: 100~250MB \nBasic recommended install\nThe most basic and recommended partitioning for a fully functional system, is a swap partition and a root partition / consuming the rest of the diskapce.\nMore Advanced Install\nFor this I will recommend;\nDiskSpace -The goal of this page is to offer advice and strategy on partitioning a Linux system.\n&\nRecommended Partitioning Scheme\n\nA: Yes, you can definitely create as many Ubuntu or other Linux installations as you want.  I usually make a copy of my old system before trying or installing a new version, so I can compare things or even go back.\nI don't know why the CD would tell you you must delete everything and start over; I've never seen that.  At what point does it say that, and what does it say exactly?\nI normally create the partition(s) myself first, using gparted, and make sure I know where it is, how big it is, etc.  Then, during the install, I choose a manual installation (with Ubuntu, it's called \"Something Else\").  I just tell it to install into the partition I created, and put GRUB into the MBR of the boot drive (assuming you are not using GPT with UEFI, something I haven't messed with myself).  It should allow you to boot either of the 3 operating systems.  If it doesn't detect the existing systems, then something is wrong - possibly a UEFI issue, which I don't really know a lot about.\nOne thing to be aware of is that with all linux distros I've installed, it will always change GRUB to point to the most recent partition's /boot/grub, and use that partition's GRUB menu for booting.  So, if you delete the most recent distro, you will no longer be able to boot until you fix it by pointing the GRUB bootloader to a previous /boot/grub menu.\nIf you are using the GPT rather than MBR, then some of this will probably be different, and hopefully someone can help with whatever the GPT equivalents are.\nEDIT:  When you add partitions, you don't need to make them bootable; the disk is bootable.  It boots and runs GRUB, when then knows how to load many of the operating systems, or it \"chain loads\" ones like Windows that have their own boot protocol.\nUntil you've done it a few times, it can be scary, and dangerous I guess. You need to pay attention, and not assume it will know what to do.\n", "Q: How do I change the default password?

Mild because the password is stored inside the script in plain text. Nevertheless it should prevent average users from changing the wallpaper.\nWhat it does is that when a user changes the wallpaper, it changes back immediately, and the user is prompted for a password. If the password is correct, the wallpaper changes into the newly set one, otherwise nothing happens.\n\nTo minimize the risk, store the script in an unexpected place under an unexpected name, and /or as a hidden file.\nTo use it:\nCopy the script below into an empty file, set a password of your choice in the head section (I wouldn't choose your sudo password for security reasons, since it is in plain text!) and save it as name.py, run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/name.py\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport time\nimport subprocess\n\nset_password = \"monkey\"\n\nkey = \"org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"\nread = \"gsettings get \"+key; change = \"gsettings set \"+key\nset_wallpaper = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", read]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\npass_window ='zenity --entry --entry-text=\"Enter password\" --text=\"Enter password\" --title=\"password\" --hide-text'\n\ndef check_wall():\n    global set_wallpaper\n    curr_wallpaper = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", read]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    if curr_wallpaper != set_wallpaper:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", change+set_wallpaper])\n        try:\n            entered_password = subprocess.check_output(\n                [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", pass_window]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n        except Exception:\n            entered_password = None\n        if entered_password == set_password:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", change+curr_wallpaper])\n            set_wallpaper = curr_wallpaper\n    else:\n        pass\n\nwhile True:\n    check_wall()\n    time.sleep(3)\n\n\nposted on gist.gisthub\n\nA: This turned out to be a nice challenge.

Not in Greek, though -- it just displays the English text but using Greek characters. I have tried switching VirtualBox's language to Spanish and relaunching the program, and the same happens -- it displays the Spanish text but using Greek. \nHere you can see what I mean: \n\nIt also happened with other applications downloaded from the Lubuntu Software Center, such as Wine Launcher Creator.

I like to scan my windows flash drive and occassionally my whole linux HDD for viruses using my xubuntu 12.04 LTS setup.  clamTK gives me too many false alerts to use it for a whole HDD and now AVG seems to have cancelled its .deb file for the terminal scanner.  While I wish AVG had a GUI, I miss its quick, efficient scans.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus/Avg\nthe first link below seems to recommend Comodo.  I have no experience with Comodo and seems to be an always running cumbersome AV.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus\nhttps://www.comodo.com/home/download/download.php?prod=antivirus-for-linux\n\nI know many linux users think that AV is not necessary for linux/BSD, but I was wondering what the rest of us are using in 2014 ?  A thorough AV engine with a simple GUI would be great.\nPlease help,\nLBjr\n\nA: found it here & yes it still works great –\nhttp://free.avg.com/us-en/download-free-all-product\n", "Q: \"Corrupted shell\" after cryptdisks_start I've been using luks encryption for USB backup drives for years with no problems, but now I have some strange behaviour. The difference is that here the whole system (except /boot) is on LVM over luks over a soft RAID.\nEverything is OK with the encrypted LVM, but after doing a cryptdisks_start to unlock the backup drive (I added an entry in /etc/crypttab for it) everything I type (console or SSH session) is not displayed (including going to a new line after I type enter). I'm obliged to close the session (or both the root and user session if I did a su -) to get back to normal.\nThe drive is actually unlocked and I can use it. cryptdisks_stop works fine. If I remove the /etc/crypttab entry for the backup driver and unlock it with cryptsetup luksOpen ... it also works fine and the man page for cryptdisks_start says it's just a wrapper around cryptsetup that parses /etc/crypttab.\nHow can I fix that?\n\nA: It's a bug that's only been fixed in the 14.10 version of cryptsetup, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/1301086\nI modified the setup to use a key file as the problem comes from askpass that is handling the interactive password.\n", "Q: SH file not executing successfully I am new in linux.

I am new to ubuntu ..So basically an OS has an app for a purpose..\nBut ubuntu has three basic text-editors..like nano, vi, emacs ...\nSo what is the reason for that? and what are the advantages and disadvantages between these editors?\n\nA: Let's start with the two big ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*vi is installed by default on almost all Linux (and other Unix) systems for many decades. This makes it something like the lowest common denominator, the editor every Linux/Unix user should at least know a little bit about in order to fix small problems (and install other editors if they want). As a result of its ubiquity it is used by many system administrators. Note that in most cases vi is actually vim (VI improved). \n\n*emacs has been around for almost as long as vi. Compared to vi it eats more system resources (although that isn't much of an issue anymore nowadays). In my experience, emacs is used less by system administrators, but more in the scientific world.\n\n\nI would advise to learn at least one of these two editors, even though their learning curve is steeper than nano's. They've been around for ages and are extremely powerful. When considering which of the two editors to choose, please beware of the editor war. See also this unix.stackexchange.com post.\nAs for nano, it is a 'follow-up' from the pico editor, that was used by the pine command line e-mail program. nano is easier to use for users that are new to the command line (basically because it list the keyboard shortcuts at the bottom of the screen). \n\nA: Ubuntu has nano and vi as command line editor editor and gedit as GUI based text editor. Each of these has their own advantage and disadvantage which is too broad to explain here.  \nIn short few editor are easy to use but less productive where as some are little complex but greatly productive.  However selecting any editor or software is matter of personal interest.\n", "Q: \"Libkmod: EROR... ignoring bad line\" start-up issue Just started using Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and when i try to boot it, it gives me this error message.

Thought that its going to stop giving this error (beginner, sorry), but its not. The error is still here.\nI created this ath9k.conf file few days ago because my notebook have a wifi button problem so i found solution to create it and add few lines in it.

Is there a way to define a filter that does this?\nExample: today I upgraded bash and didn't have time to upgrade everything else, but still I figured I could upgrade other vulnerable packages at the same time, only I couldn't find a list of those.\n\nA: It can be done using apt-get easily .\nFirst create a source list which contain only security repo.\ngrep security /etc/apt/sources.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.seurity.list\n\nNow upgrade your system using this list \napt-get upgrade -o Dir::Etc::SourceList=/etc/apt/security.sources.list\n\nI am not 100% sure about synaptic, but synaptic has a section of security repository  when origin option is selected.

I would suggest you install the newest version 14.04 which will be good through April 2019 or 12.04 which is supported through April 2017.  Also, you will need to install xorg once you have your server version installed.  You would also want to install a graphical desktop too.

All of us save our files to a single computer which has windows share enabled on the project folder. There are occasionally power cuts in our place and most of the time when a power failure happens, the file which we are currently working on is blank completely after power comes back, even if the file was saved. Due to this all our work gets lost sometimes. \nI wanted to ask if there is anything in Ubuntu with which we can buffer the current file in some temp folder or anything similar, some other more stable/reliable method of sharing a project.\nCurrently we are not in a position to put a ups backup to computers and when power goes, the backup generator takes few seconds to start up again.\nTo overcome the situation, we fearfully make a backup of the complete folder every hour. The project size is around 3 GB, so it is kind of a pain. \nWe use different versions of Ubuntu but this scenario is not dependent on version we are using. Also, we use different editors; some use eclipse, I use sublime, but it's not dependent on this either.\n\nA: Do you use some flavour of Linux on the server?\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a journaling filesystem on the server should mitigate the issue\nof lost files (Windows has NTFS, Linux has ext3, ext4 and others).\n\n*Using a UPS would be even better in this case as computers tend to break when frequently losing power. There are inexpensive UPS available worldwide.\n\n*Taking full backups isn't a good idea, a good backup solution would implement for example a daily full backup and hourly increments. Solutions that do deduplication don't have this issue. You could also use LVM on the server and take snapshots.\n\n\nA: Our team uses sublime text editor. So, after googling a bit here and there I found out sublime AutoBackup package and installed it through the package control manager of sublime. This extension/package automatically takes backup of the file user is editing and it is also completely customizable like you can have backup for every second (which we are using) and also the file size of the backup can be controlled. See this link to understand all the options provided.\nI am also now using autosave package with this and till now, not a single file got cleaned away by power failure.\nIf there is any other suggestion from your side, please leave a comment.\n", "Q: installing ubuntu 14.04 x32 it's my first time installing Ubuntu on my desktop I've tried more than 5 copies, 3 usbs and programs ,2 cd's, changed the BIOS settings , used the special boot menu but have the same result:\nWhen I chose to run ubuntu inside windows 8 32 this happens:\nUnable to find a medium containing a live file system\n\nWhen it's booting from the boot menu this happens:\n(mounting /dev/loop0 on//filesystem.squashfs failed: no such device not mount.\n/dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //file system.squashfs\n\nI tried to install it by VM and every thing was good.\nWhy I can't install it?\n\nA: Running Ubuntu inside Window's 8?

Ftp uses two ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*the command port (or listen port), default 21.\n\n*the data port (default 20).\n\n\nThe command port is certainly free, and that's why you could connect and authenticate, and issue get and put commands. But when going to the transfer, another connection is opened on the data port, and this one fails. So, you have to check (and maybe modify) the data port, not the command port.\nThe problem is even more difficult because ftp has two modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 'passive' mode in which the default ports are used.\n\n*The 'active' mode in which ports are negotiated.\n\n\nThis is why I would strongly suggest you to try transfers in passive mode (it's not the default).

It's not possible.\nOnce connected to the signal, if emitted it will call finishCreation without arguments. I guess that explains why you're seeing empty items.\nTo ensure that when the signal handler is called you have access to both soundName and soundLocation I would make them globals, like component and element in the js file (untested):\nvar component;\nvar element;\nvar _soundName;\nvar _soundLocation;\n\nfunction createElement(soundName, soundLocation) {\n    component = Qt.createComponent(\"../AlertsSettingsSounds.qml\")\n    _soundName = soundName\n    _soundLocation = soundLocation\n    if (component.status === Component.Ready)\n        finishCreation()\n    else\n        component.statusChanged.connect(finishCreation)\n}\n\nfunction finishCreation() {\n    if (component.status === Component.Ready) {\n        element = component.createObject(alertsModel, {\n                                             \"Name\": _soundName,\n                                             \"Sound\": _soundLocation});\n\n        if (element === null)\n            // Error Handling\n            console.log(\"Error creating object\");\n    } else if (component.status === Component.Error)\n        // Error Handling\n        console.log(\"Error loading component: \", component.errorString());\n}\n\n\nA: Fixed it. It appears to be that I should not create a ListElement component. Instead, the ListModel should look like:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\n\nimport Irc_App 0.1\n\nimport \"../js/AlertsSettingsFunctions.js\" as AlertsSettingsFunction\n\n// Using the sounds from the folder\nListModel {\n    id: alertsModel\n    objectName: \"alertsModel\"\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        for (var i = 0; i < soundsHandler.sounds.length; i++)\n            AlertsSettingsFunction.makeList(alertsModel,\n                                            soundsHandler.sounds[i],\n                                            soundsHandler.soundsLocation + \"/\"\n                                            + soundsHandler.sounds[i])\n    }\n}\n\nAnd the JavaScript file should look like:\nfunction makeList(id, soundName, soundLocation) {\n    id.append({\"name\" : soundName, \"sound\" : soundLocation})\n}\n\nIt should be appended to the list.\n", "Q: Proxy does not work using sudo I set the proxy using system setting -> Network -> Network Proxy.

Opening a new tab or a new terminal does exactly the same thing: it launches a new instance of your $SHELL (bash by default) in interactive, non-login mode. What this means is that the following files are read:\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n~/.bashrc\n\nIf you start a login shell, bash will read /etc/profile, and the first of these it finds: /.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile. This is all explain in the Invocation section of man bash:\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a\nnon-interactive  shell with the --login option, it first reads\nand executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file\nexists.   After  reading    that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile,\n~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and\nexecutes commands from the first one  that exists  and  is\nreadable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the    shell is\nstarted to inhibit this behavior.\n[...]\nWhen  an  interactive  shell that is not a login shell is started,\nbash    reads and executes commands from  /etc/bash.bashrc  and\n~/.bashrc,  if    these  files  exist.\n\nFor more details on the various files sourced or executed under different conditions, see my answer here.\n", "Q: Remove Edubuntu from Triple Boot I have a computer that has Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.04, and Edubuntu installed together.

I have seen a file named lock in /var/cache/apt/archives in my Ubuntu 14.04. This file has only root access. When I try to display the contents of this file using sudo nano lock the file seems empty. What is actually the purpose of this file?\n\nA: The lock file you mention is used to avoid running more than one instance of any software able to add packages (apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, ...).\nThis is necessary because the list of installed software is saved in DB file. Having more than one process accessing this DB will lead to corruption into it and break your installed software DB.\nLock files are created by a program when it is necessary to have only one instance of this program running at the same time.\nGenerally, this is to avoid that local files/DB are accessed concurrently because this may corrupt them.\n\nA: This is a marker file used to keep programs from changing a file simultaneously. Were that to happen, it's likely one of the changes would be lost.\nSo, you likely have a file in that directory that is being accessed by some program.\n", "Q: Installation problem with Ubuntu from USB I followed the instructions, but now I want to install it but I get the following message\nThe creation of swap space in partition failed #6 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sdb) failed\n\n\nI have partitioned my HDD into the main one for mac and for Ubuntu I gave 40gb.

It looks as if one cannot format it or write to it in this state.\nSome commands that are able to verify this by trying to read the drive are (assuming the device node is /dev/sdc):\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null bs=1m count=1\n\nIf they abort with an I/O error, the device is likely broken.\n\nA: After giving up on the USB stick, instead of throwing it away, you may try to disassemble it to see if its memory is in the form of an sd card (micro).  Sometimes the USB reader electronics will fail, but the memory is still OK.  Try using the card in an adapter or card reader to see if it is usable.  I have successfully saved one micro sd card this way from a completely dead USB.\n\nA: You might want to try a \"Slow Erase\" with \"Empty Partitioning\".

I'm trying to make a static binary of rm, so I tried compiling coreutils with \nconfigure; make SHARED=0 CC='gcc -static'; make install\n\nbut I keep running into errors.\nFirst make complains about c99 or gnu99, I solved that by adding -std=gnu99 to the CC value:\nmake SHARED=0 CC='gcc -static -std=gnu99'\n\nAfter that it says:\n/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/crtbeginT.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against `__TMC_END__' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/crtbeginT.o: error adding symbols: Bad value\n\nI tried adding -fPIC like I added the -std option but to no avail.\nIs it even possible to make static binaries of coreutils? (only interested in rm)\nIf so, how? (I have 0 experience with building linux binaries)\nPS: I downloaded the coreutils source from the ubuntu site, trusty.(coreutils-8.21)\n\nA: Per this comment on bug #640734, there is a workaround that you may try:\n$ cd /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8\n$ sudo cp crtbeginT.o crtbeginT.orig.o\n$ sudo cp crtbeginS.o crtbeginT.o\n\nAlso, add -fPIC to the command above:\nmake SHARED=0 CFLAGS='-static -std=gnu99 -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -fPIC'\n\nOnce you're done with the compilation just restore the original file like this:\n$ cd /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8\n$ sudo cp crtbeginT.orig.o crtbeginT.o\n$ sudo rm crtbeginT.orig.o\n\n\nA: You can retrieve a precompiled version with static-get\nstatic-get -x coreutils\n\n", "Q: Compro VideoMate TV PVR/FM In Ubuntu 14.04 x64 I have a Compro VideoMate TV PVR/FM In Ubuntu 14.04 x64 and would like to use it with MythTV.

I uploaded them to var/www and for whatever reason the pictures that I have tried to upload do not display. I am a complete noob when it comes to linux and internet programming. I have double checked the html and that isn't the issue.\nI was wondering if anyone has had this issue and figured out how to resolve it.\nHelp is greatly appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: If you are able to access the main html page (ie, index.html or the like) or any other page, and the pictures are under the /var/www directory, then it would be a permissions problem. What kinds of errors are you getting? No permission? Not found? Login to your server via ssh (ssh USERNAME@SERVERIP or run PuTTY from Windows) and try the following in order until you run into a problem or/and STOP when the problem is fixed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you can access any files on your webserver. Does the index page come up? If not, you have LAMP incorrectly set up. Go through the tutorials again or post another question here.\n\n*Ensure your files are even there. Do ls /var/www and make sure you see the files you are trying to upload. If you do see your files, skip to step 6.\n\n*Re-upload your files using ftp and either an admin's or the www-data user's credentials. Try viewing your images again. \n\n*If uploading worked and you see your files if you ls /var/www, skip to step 6. Manually add the files using scp if on Ubuntu:\nscp /path/to/picture.png USERNAME@SERVERIP:/var/www/\n\n*If the files are STILL not there or if using Windows, manually add the files via external media (ie, flashdrive).\n\n*Run chmod 755 /var/www -R. That will allow all files to be read by anybody, but only allow the owner of /var/www to change the files. Try viewing your pictures again.\n\n*You may have some other permission issues if this doesn't work. Do ls -lR /var/www and show us the output.\n\n\nThe only other thing I can thing of would be some kind of filter blocking pictures from being accessed directly.

Also, at the lab I have an Activities button which, when pressed, displays the left-hand applications panel, but at home I have the panel on display all the time.\nI am puzzled as to why there should be such differences.  Thanks in advance for any enlightenment.\nRRS\nAnswer to query: yes I did go through all upgrades, about 330 MB of downloads.\n\nA: It sounds like that 'at the lab' you are running Ubuntu Gnome, and at home you are running Ubuntu Unity.  You can find information on the two at Difference between Unity and GNOME\n", "Q: What is the patch Level of Ubuntu 12.04.4 I need to confirm the patch level of 12.04.4 as being Level 4.\n\nA: You can find the current revision number or patch level in /etc/lsb-release and /etc/issue. As far as I can tell, that's what the application prerequisites refer to, because that's the only sub-release versioning scheme of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Problem with Chrome/Chromium rendering bootstrap template (14.04) I'm having an issue with Chrome and Chromium not rendering a particular Twitter Bootstrap template properly.

Regarding the same I found the following:\nThe cause is multi layered:\n- pcduino is NOT an Arduino board even if the pinout resembles an Aruino\n- the name is rather misleading seems no more that an advertising gimmick\n- most people look at it as a Linux board with some pins as against a microcontroller with Linux. Thus there is little interest for the MC side thus little info. As the lack of replies to your question shows.\n- The IDE is not ported properly: IE you have to muck around with makefiles and manual compile.\nSince I am looking for a fast microcontroller with true Arduino environment and this board is NOT one of those i did not and will not buy one. (It could be but at this stage the developers don't give a dime about porting the IDE/compile chain. If this changes in the future so will my attitude towards the product.)\nWithout any intent to hurt, you bought the board without researching if it is what you need/want.\nIf you want to make it work you'll need to learn how the compiling chain works and how makefiles are created. It is a science on its own. (Hence we use the Arduino environment.)\n", "Q: How do you restore an encrypted hard drive?

And If I try to use 32 Bit, I have to have less than 2 GB ram, but I have got 3 GB.\n\nA: Your processor is 64 bit with 4 cores, you have enough memory to comfortable work, so why not to install 64 bit system ? You definitely should try it. You will be satisfied with performance of ubuntu 14.04 64 bit\n\nA: If you have a 64 bit processor, I think it's best to use a 64 bit OS when available. It doesn't matter what video card you have.  But with 64 bit, you can access more than 4 GB of RAM if you decide you need it later.  But you can't upgrade from 32 to 64 bit, so once you install one, you would need to reinstall to change in the future.\nOne thing to remember about linux is that you can copy the OS from one system to a new system.  So, if you get a new computer that's more powerful, you can copy your existing 64 bit OS to the new system if you want, and it will work.\nAlso, I believe many tests have shown that the 64 bit system performs better in some situations.\nEDIT, I don't know who came up with the guidelines for which version to use on the Ubuntu page, but it doesn't really make a lot of sense.  Why 2GB?  32 bit can access up to 4 GB. And it doesn't even address whether you have a 32 bit or 64 bit CPU.\n", "Q: Restart ntlmaps without logging out?

I'm very new to linux (specifically Ubuntu 14.04) and it's been 20 years since I worked on a unix system. Even back then, my command line tasks were rare enough that I had a series of Post-It notes with command sequences to help me out. I'm learning Ubuntu to help with some open source projects I'm working on. Honestly, I'm finding linux a bit frustrating coming from a Windows command line / batch file / Powershell world. Enough background for now...\nmy command prompt has changed back and forth beween root@serverName and user@serverName but I'm not sure how or why. I also noticed that some directories are not accessible but definitely exist and I lack permissions to write in some other folders.\nWhat do the different usernames at the command prompt mean and how do I keep track of which folders I can read/write? References are appreciated as I'm not opposed to digging but I don't even know what to look for at this point.\nThanks!\n\nA: Your command-line prompt is defined in the startup script of the shell (bash by default, but YMMV); the default in Ubuntu is to set it to $USER@$HOST, in other words, the user@servername you are looking at. \nYou normally log in to your user on an Ubuntu machine; this user has relatively low privileges --- reading world readable files, reading/writing their own files, using the public services (printers, etc.) but no configuring them. The \"administrator\" user in Unix machines is called root (aka superuser), and has all privileges --- it can do anything to the system. When you switch from your normal user to root, the prompt changes as a way to warn you. \nTo do the switch there have been traditionally two ways: one is to log in directly as root, and the other one is gaining privileges with a command like su or sudo (su stands for switch user). In Ubuntu the first method is frowned upon; normally the root user has no password at all and can't login directly. \nThe Ubuntu Way to get root permission is that a subset of users, the ones that are in the sudo or adm group, can switch to superuser \"powers\" by sudo -i. You can check with the command groups: \n[romano:~] % groups\nromano adm mail dialout cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare vboxusers\n\n(the group system is the Unix way to give partial privileges to user). \nLook at this example for my prompt (this is not standard, I use liquidprompt): \n\nFor digging more, this unix tutorial is a good source of information. \n\nA: In Linux, \"superuser\" privileges give you access to read and write any file on the entire system.  You can gain superuser privileges by either logging in as a user called \"root\", or by using something like sudo.\nBecause it's designed to be able to be used by multiple users, and so no one of those users can mess up the system for everyone else, Linux has user accounts and keeps each users' own files separate and protected, so that only that user can modify them.  Your files will be located in (by default), /home/username/.  In addition to this, no regular user can modify \"system\" files such as the installed programs or their system-wide configurations.\nIf you need to do anything which affects the whole system, you'll probably need to use superuser privileges by logging in as root or using sudo.  However, it's important to note that you should not normally log in as root or use sudo, and when you do so, you need to be extremely careful about what you are doing.\n\nA: To answer your question \"how do I keep track of which folders I can read/write\" this is normally done on ubuntu and unix-like systems using the find command.  \nFor example, here is a post at the unix and linux forums Searching File in Directory and all Subdirectory and Delete @ http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-and-scripting/255252-searching-file-directory-all-subdirectory-delete.html where the -user flag to the find command is used to perform a routine unix system admin take.\nFor more on the find command, visit this man page reference for find:\nhttp://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/find/\n", "Q: Why I can not update my programs Every time I try to run the built-in software updater it tells me that it needs an additional 11.8 mb on \"/boot\" and to empty my trash, clean my system with sudo apt-get clean.\nI've tried both methods and even ran bleachbit but it still says the same.\n\nA: I think you've a lot unused kernels,so you can delete unwanted kernel images and headers.\nTo list all installed kernels, run\ndpkg -l linux-image-\\* | grep ^ii\n\nOne command to show all kernels and headers that can be removed, excluding the current running kernel:\nkernelver=$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')\ndpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' | grep -ve $kernelver\n\nI recommend test a newer kernel before removing older.\nSo, after upgrading kernels and rebooting to test it, you can remove all other kernels with:\nsudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' | grep -ve \"$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')\")\n\n", "Q: How do you disable audio input in Ubuntu 14.04 Sorry about that last post. \nInfo:\nI am running Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 in VM workstation. \nQuestion:\nI want to disable all and only the input sound devices and keep the output devices. I cannot find an option under sound setting GUI to do this.\nReason:\nI don't have a microphone plugged into my computer. If Ubuntu tries to access input sound device when I don't have an input device on my host (Windows 7), then VMware workstation would say \"Device ID out of range, sound adapter will be disconnected.\" This will disconnect both the input and output device (because it is in one VMWare virtualized sound adapter). I want to get output, and don't want the sound adapter to disconnect.\nThings I have tried:\nMuting all the input devices doesn't work. \nThanks.\n\nA: I found my own answer.\nInstall pavucontrol (PulseAudio Volume Control) package through Synaptic or apt-get. Open Terminal and type \"pavucontrol\" to open the GUI. Under Configuration allows you to change profiles, which was in older version of Ubuntu default sound preference GUI but disappeared. Change profile to Analog Stereo Output instead of Analog Stereo Duplex. Ubuntu will no longer use any sound input devices.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure (Step 6)\n\nA: Though the comments above were very useful, I still feel I'm guessing exactly what you are trying to do, and I'm even less clear about why.\nProviding that your quest is to DISABLE the sound card entirely, I would recommend you install the Synaptic Package Manager and use its search facility to find the INSTALLED drivers for your sound card and simply delete them.  I would think that would disable more than the input, but you haven't provided strict parameters for answers.\nIf all you really want to do is MUTE the input aspect of your OS, that's a setting... or at least it used to be.  As it happens I'm seated at a sad old laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 (no longer supported), and it's Sound Preferences screen looks suspiciously similar to (my recollections of) those of more recent releases.  So if all you want to do is mute the input, please do it that easy way.\nJust to cover all my bases, I checked if Synaptic had an app specifically designed to mute audio inputs.  I could not find such an app, but that doesn't mean there's not a BASH command you can enter to simply mute the inputs.\n", "Q: Keyboard pass-through from one Ubuntu PC to another? I have two PCs running Ubuntu.

You can get it legally for free from Github or buy a version from their website.\n\nShare one mouse and keyboard between multiple computers.\n  Synergy is free and open source (free as in free speech),\n  meaning you are free to run it and redistribute it with\n  or without changes.\n\nI used an older version of Synergy's predecessor years ago, and did not find it suitable for regular work due to lag and connection problems that occur from time to time. Personally, I would recommend that you invest in a physical hardware KVM switch instead (KVM = \"keyboard, video and mouse\"). There are numerous models that support both PS/2 and USB keyboards, and some are configurable to allow switching using custom keyboard shortcuts.\n", "Q: problem when reinstall apache2 ubuntu 14.04 I had some problem when reinstall apache2.\nI use:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall apache2 apache2-bin\n\nand then error with this messages,\n/etc/init.d/apache2: 64: .: Can't open /etc/apache2/envvars\n/etc/init.d/apache2: 76: .: Can't open /etc/apache2/envvars\nERROR: APACHE_PID_FILE needs to be defined in /etc/apache2/envvarsinvoke-rc.d: initscript apache2, action \"restart\" failed\n\nI try to purge use this:\nsudo apt-get purge apache2\n\nafter that I try to reinstall again use this:\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nThis is message when I try to reinstall apache2 use that code:\n    Reading package lists...

The syntax errors weren't actually in this file, but this is the script that LightDM uses to load my ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc and ~./bash_aliases files after I login.

Just curious because I do not recall installing Samba or having any type of windows computer on my network.\n\nA: SMB client (samba) is installed by default (so you can connect to Windows shares), but SMB server is not.You have to install it if you want to create a Windows share.\nOpening your own home folder in the file explorer is a special case: it display it as if it was a network share, but obviously, it is not.\nHTH\n", "Q: Unity doesn't load - no Launcher or Dash appears I am using 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my simple Desktop-PC (3GHz Intel P4, 1GB RAM, Intel inbuilt Graphics, and NO extra graphic-card)  so nothing to worry about graphic like nvidia etc.\nHere is output of lspci:\n$ lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82945G/GZ/P/PL Memory Controller Hub (rev 02)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82945G/GZ Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family PCI Express Port 1 (rev 01)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family PCI Express Port 2 (rev 01)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family PCI Express Port 3 (rev 01)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family PCI Express Port 4 (rev 01)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family USB UHCI Controller #1 (rev 01)\n00:1d.1 USB controller: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family USB UHCI Controller #2 (rev 01)\n00:1d.2 USB controller: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family USB UHCI Controller #3 (rev 01)\n00:1d.3 USB controller: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family USB UHCI Controller #4 (rev 01)\n00:1d.7 USB controller: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family USB2 EHCI Controller (rev 01)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 PCI Bridge (rev e1)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801GB/GR (ICH7 Family) LPC Interface Bridge (rev 01)\n00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) IDE Controller (rev 01)\n00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family SATA Controller [IDE mode] (rev 01)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation NM10/ICH7 Family SMBus Controller (rev 01)\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

It opens a new terminal since myApp requires a terminal to run in the background. But every time I open a new terminal, it gets hijacked by the myApp icon. What I mean by that is that in the side bar, it looks like I have 3 myApp windows opened after I click the terminal icon 3 times. The terminal icon, when clicked on keeps opening new terminals instead of opening the most recent one. Is this changeable?\n\nA: Application windows of one and the same application can in principle only be grouped in one application icon, so all gnome-terminal windows are grouped in one icon. Normally that improves the coherence of the launcher.\nA side effect is that if you have your application run in the terminal from a .desktop file, and the terminal window appears under the icon of your application, all terminal windows you open while your application is running are grouped under that same icon of your application, until you close your application.\nUnless...\nYou add a non-sense StartupWMClass= line to your application's .desktop file:\nStartupWMClass=Monkey\n\nThen your application will appear under the terminal's icon. New terminal windows will as well.\nNote\nThe effect mentioned above occurs only when the command you run in your application's  Exec= line is the main command of your .desktop file. It does not happen from possible shortcuts you add to an existing launcher.\nSince it seems a terminal-only script, another, and probably cleaner solution would therefore be to add the scipt as a shortcut to your existing gnome-terminal launcher (or any other icon that seems appropriate). In that case you would have to replace the line (in a local copy of the gnome-terminal.desktop file):\nActions=New\n\nby:\nActions=New;Myapp;\n\nand add at the bottom of the file:\n[Desktop Action MyApp]\nName=MyApp\nExec=gnome-terminal -x bash -c \"/usr/local/myAppDir/myApp\"\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n", "Q: tcpdump permissions problem Am having trouble running tcpdump.

You need to give tcpdump the permission and capability to allow raw packet captures and network interface manipulation.\nAdd a capture group and add yourself to it:\nsudo groupadd pcap\nsudo usermod -a -G pcap $USER\n\nNext, change the group of tcpdump and set permissions:\nsudo chgrp pcap /usr/sbin/tcpdump\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/sbin/tcpdump\n\nFinally, use setcap to give tcpdump the necessary permissions:\nsudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump\n\nBe careful, that this will allow everybody from the group pcap to manipulate network interfaces and read raw packets!\nFound it here: Configure tcpdump to work as non-root\n\nA: Perhaps this might work.

I have started to use Ardour and the problem is the Jack server apparently does not recognize my digitech rp500 pedalboard connected through USB. \nWhen I use it in Windows with Adobe Audition it's just plug&play. In Ubuntu I have only succeeded with Audacity. \nBut in the Jack server (in order to use Ardour) only appears in the \"Alsa\" tab, but never in the \"Audio\" tab. I can't figure out how to connect all these components to record my guitar with Ardour. I have tried connecting RP500 out -> Midi in, in the Alsa tab and Midi out-> Ardour in, in the Audio tab, but nothing worked.\nApparently Jack server is working fine since I've been able to record something from Yoshimi and the RP500 driver is OK as well, since Audacity works fine with it.\nAny help would be appreciate.\nThank you very much!!!\n\nA: Run \"qjackctl\"  (install it eventually) , clic \"settings\".\nLook for the \"interface\" selection and clic on the \">\" near it: you should see your usb device in the list.\nJust select it  and  close and restart Qjackctl : now you should see \"system\" with \"playback\" and \"capture\" in the audio connection window .   \nDelayed recording  problem : the delay  on the  recorded sound (latency)   is caused by the \"sample/periods\" setting (1024 on the screen capture): set it to 128 or 256. The obtained latency is displayed  in the bottom right : 5 ms or less is excellent , around 10 ms is ok.\nIf you set latency too low , you will get clics  (\"xruns\") when recording with Ardour.\nStop Ardour, jack and qjackctl for applying changes \nAudio level problem: You must first set an acceptable level for Ardour  using alsamixer in a terminal  or gnome-alsamixer (install it) , select your usb sound card (F6 in alsamixer, click on the relevant tab in gnome-alsamixer), then increase \"capture\" faders etc...\n Ardour as a built-in mixer  but incoming sound level must be roughly good.  \nNo sound  from other programs : Normal, as jackd takes the sound card , disabling pulseaudio (this is automatic).So stop jackd with qjackctl when you don't use Ardour.\n You can use also jack compatible programs like vlc (vlc-jack, to be installed) .

The purpose of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol) is to give you a connection that delivers data that is exactly what was send, and in the same order. You still get this from the connection in perfect quality, as long as the connection is not dropped. \nBut, obviously there is a compromise - the connection is slow.\nBecause it's really difficult to simulate a perfect connection over a connection that looses about 12% of it's data in some irregular way.\nWe do not expect magic, so some compromise needs to be accepted. \nOne could ask whether it's possible to use something else that does what TCP/IP does, but faster.\nFor a general solution, we can just assume that TCP/IP nearly optimal, because lots of research over lots of time was spend on it.\n(With a special solution for you connection, developed based on measurements on the connection, it can be faster for sure, and even faster if you use hardware adapted to your connection - but that direction makes not much sense here)\nNow, all we can do is look for a different compromise:\nThe other end of the scale of compromises is a very fast connection, with - 12% package loss.\nThat is what you have if you do not use TCP/IP, but UDP/IP (User Datagram Protocol), which transfers separate packages for you, and gives no guarantee that they arrive in order, or at all.\nIn theory, you could have compromises with less package loss, and slower,  in between, build on top of UDP/IP. But in many cases, only TCP/IP makes sense.\nSo, the practical anser is: \"Get the connection fixed!\"\n\n\nSome practical notes: \nRegarding why the connection get's slow: TCP can recognize when it sends too many packages, and slow down, but I do not think that's what is happening here. \nLoosing packages is a very different problem compared to sending too many packages. \nI think the time is spend on retransmitting lost packages, and waiting for missing packages in between, that need to be delivered befor others that were already received.\nAs you did not say which kind of data you want to transfer: There are good reasons to prefer 12% packet loss over UDP/IP for some use cases:\nIt you transfer real time video from a camera, you only care about packets that arrive in time to be displayed on the screen. With TCP, the data would arrive complete and in order, but unuseable, because too late. Getting 88% of a video stream right in time is a lot better, it can even be enough for a good transmission.\n", "Q: How can I automount cd in Ubuntu 14.04?

By default, apt-get and dpkg will overwrite any files that have a matching filename, and overwrite.  If you are still dealing with old files on the target system, then the package is weird.\nUltimately, if you are always changing files continually as part of development and there's a lot of leftover bits, you should probably NOT be using a PPA for it, and just stick to building from source until you have a stable release.\n", "Q: Looping through csv, removing patterns I have  a question similar to my earlier question, but a bit different\nsay you have 10 columns on each line, and 100000 lines, I want to check if each row for the following patterns:\nIf a  row looks like this, i want to remove it\n lambda a, b, c, d: a==a and a+1==b and b+1==c and c+1==d and d+1==e\n\nWhile this solution works great, all solutions worked, all followed the same logic.

Recently we had a new client come to us with an old Linux server that they're having some problems with. They boot up the server but the GUI never loads. It has never done this before, and the server remains functional. We're able to access data hosted on the server, ping the server, use PuTTY to obtain log files, etc. but the GUI or command line won't load. Suggestions?\nThe following displays on the screen:\n\nIt won't allow us to type commands or do anything. \n\nA: Summarizing from comments:\nSo, the screen shows that the boot process got stuck when starting a service pwrstatd.\nAs you can ssh too the box, I expect that the other virtual consoles are working normal (Ctrl+Alt+F2 etc).\nThey would show a text mode login screen. When logged in, the GUI can be started:\nHow do I restart a Unity session from the terminal?\nThe GUI is installed -  I think it would be started at the end of the init scripts.  \nBut that startup of pwrstatd hangs, so they never reach the end.\nThe name suggests that is is about power statistics, and it seems to be not part of ubuntu - maybe it can just be removed, if not fixed? \n\nA: To answer your question, pwrstatd is a Cyberpower UPS program daemon that enables the computer its connected via USB to preform tasks and scripts during power and battery events. Its actually kind of interesting. \nSee here: \nhttps://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/software/power-panel-personal/#platform-section\nWhile I am not sure at this point why its hanging at boot on your computer, I can tell you that it does not seem to load at boot after I install it on mine. I suspect that there may be parallels here (yours is hanging, and mine is not appearing to load). Questions if you know:\n1. how do you check to see what programs start at boot.\n2. how to I get pwrstatd to be one of them.\nI know it needs to run as root to query the UPS and also to issue shutdown commands to the computer (if configured that way).\nYou can use it by going to prompt \"sudo pwrstat -status\"  and \"sudo pwrstat -config\" I am able to get these commands to work after starting it on my machine manually \"sudo pwrstatd start &\"\n-ding\n", "Q: Ubuntu command display man -k What does the man -k command display? \n\n\n*\n\n*All man pages in sequence with the given name in all chapters.\n\n*The man pages with a word in the name.\n\n*The manual page for the given topic.\n\n*A list of the man pages discussing the subject.\n\n\nA: from man man lol!\n\nman -k printf\n     Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular\n     expression.

It has a lot of sound-related stuff that the main version does not.\n5.1 sound configuration should work out of the box, programs that can handle it should use it directly (videolan, audacity, ...). You may want to look into the JACK daemon if you need some specific connection setup (MIDI input, etc.)\nAs pointed out bu @Rohit, the Audacity sound editor is a multi-track recorder and editor that works quite well. If it is not yet installed, you can use your preferred package manager to do so. \nHTH.\n\nA: Follow these steps in Terminal command\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kirkland/sound\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install ubuntu-sounds\nIt should work with Audacity sound editor.\n\nA: Import the file into Audacity.

Especially if that output is a list of file names that can contain anything except / and \\0.  You have fallen into bash pitfall number 1. Always use while instead. To make sure it works with all file names, including those with spaces, newlines, tabs, backslashes or any other strange characters, use this:\nfind /home/family/Music -name '*.m4a' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do\n     ffmpeg -i \"$file\" -acodec libvorbis -aq 6 -vn -ac 2 \"${file%.m4a}.ogg\";\ndone\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that I quoted *.mp4a which ensures that bash will not expand it before passing it to find. This is important for the cases where you have files that match that glob in your current directory.\n\n*The -print0, as you probably know, causes find to separate its results with \\0 instead of newlines.\n\n*IFS= : This sets the input field character to nothing, ensuring that no word splitting will take place.\n\n*while read -r -d '' file: This will iterate over the results, saving each as $file, just like for file in $(command). The options are (from help read):\n -r     do not allow backslashes to escape any characters\n -d delim   continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather\n    than newline\n\nSetting the delimiter to the empty string (-d '') makes read play nice with find's -print0.\n\n*\"${file%.mp3}.ogg\"; :  This is simply to remove the .m4a suffix and replace it with .ogg so you get foo.ogg instead of foo.m4a.ogg. \nThe rest is the same as you had attempted so I'm guessing you understand it.\n", "Q: I wanna change my Google drive permission.

It basically asks \"Is that normal?\"\nMisconfigured?\nI took the question as describing side effects of misconfigured fan- or power saving configuration.\nI tried pretty hard to find that implied problem, but finally gave up.\nIs it normal\nA misconfiguration would lead to an answer \"No, it's not normal\" - but this does not seem to be the problem.\nSo, let's take it literally - is it normal that the  left side of the case is much warmer than right?\nA relevant information is that it's a very thin notebook, the Asus VivoBook S551lb. It is relatively difficult to get heat out of a thin device.\nSo, let's take a look what is inside on the left side - maybe there's just something related to heat?\nIn this review of the S551lb there are some images of the opened device.\nThis image shows of the uncovered bottom side, with keyboard pointing down. We can see a copper heatpipe, ending between fan and air exhaust, and starting from a large heat spreader at the right. The component under that is probably the CPU, but could also be the graphics processor.  But that's irrelevant - what we know it that it's the component that produces the most heat.\nYes, normal!\nNow, the solution is easy: turning the device around, the hot component goes to the left;\nIs it normal that the case is most hot near the hottest component? Yes.\nLooking at the components on the right side, there is mainly a CD drive and the hdd. Both do not get hot, so it's also normal that the right side is relatively cool.\nAn interesting aspect is that the device has a metal body, probably made of some aluminium alloy - a good heat conductor.\nWhen you touch the surface to tell the temparature, the metal can transport a lot of heat energy from or into your finger in a short time. That makes you feel the temperature much more pronounced compared to the same temperature on a surface of some plastics or wood with much lower heat conduction.  \nAnd that is quite relevant to the question: As far as I know, touching aluminium alloy at 60°C would hurt quite badly. So we can now assume that the actual temparature was much lower;\nThat means that the reason that made me expect a fan/power misconfiguration did not exist in the first place.\nSee also this review with nice thermal imaging pictures  of the device.\n", "Q: Is there a simple HowTo for getting Ubuntu and a browser working on an old PC? I have a 2007-vintage Dell PC, formerly running WinXP.

WIth the demise of XP support, it has become infected with spamware and adware and I think I need a fresh start.  I can't get any browser (Firefox, Chrome, nor IE) to work on it at present, so will need to download the Ubuntu OS and Browser app from another PC, and then move it over after doing something to restart the whole thing (do I need to reformat the hard disk?  how do I get all the Windows junk off of the PC?

Basically a normal system where the programs installed by default are selected to be small in terms of use of ressources (disk,RAM,CPU)\nNeed something even smaller?\nBut what to do if you find out that the Lubuntu solution is still too heavy?\nWhat you need depends on how \"old\" your computer is in terms of hardware performance.\nGenerally, a \"very old\" computer is a computer with limited resources; That is similar to an embedded system.\nEmbedded systems\nIf the solution with a small variant of desktop Ubuntu does not fit, try to use a distribution aimed on embedded applications:\nOne option is the Ubuntu MinimalCD variant.\n(See also Ubuntu Mini Remix and FAQ: Ubuntu Mini Remix vs Ubuntu Minimal CD)\nThere are various Linux distributions even more minimal.\nText mode browser\nFor installing a browser, you do not need to install an X server, or even a desktop environment; There are various web browsers that work in text mode.\nIt's also possible to display images on the console;\nAs an intermediate variant, a graphical web browser could be run on a X server with just a window manager, or even on a plain X server.\n", "Q: Debian installer does not create desktop/launcher link I have a Qt application that I want to deploy as a deb package.

I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I want to buy a usb masterkeyboard (Akai LPK 25) to work with it in Linux Multimedia Studio (LMMS).\nMy questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone experiences with this or similar masterkeyboards?\n\n*Do they even work with LMMS?\n\n*If yes, do they work plug-and-play?\n\n\nA: With my basic understanding of German and Google translate, I come to the following conclusion: yes, this keyboard will function basically if not completely with LMMS.\nOn the site, you can see that the keyboard contains its own USB-MIDI interface, and assuming you're using ALSA, you'll be able to plug-and-play out of the box forwarding notes to and from the keyboard.\nBonus functions like the tap tempo buttons may not function at first, but assuming it's a standard, it shouldn't take much Googling to make it work like it should under Ubuntu or other Linux Distro.\nThe software provided of course likely will not work, but should be emulate-able using WINE.\nYes, this keyboard will work with LMMS.\n", "Q: Problem in creating alias, get strange messages [Reviewers: note that the question was completely rewritten after the close votes.]\nI recently found how I can define aliases for bash in the ~/.bashrc.\nBut since I tried that, I see the followig messages eveery time I open a terminal.\nI added some bash aliases to my I was trying to create shortcuts using alias but I unsuccessful and somehow managed to get the message below every time I open up a new terminal.\nbash: alias: UIC: not found\nbash: alias: =: not found\nbash: alias: sudo openvpn --config ~/vpn/UIC-alopez78.ovpn: not found\nbash: alias: mat: not found\nbash: alias: =: not found\nbash: alias: cd /home/alexisblopez/MATLAB/R2014a/bin/: not found\nbash: alias: lab: not found\nbash: alias: =: not found\nbash: alias: ./matlab: not found\n~$ \n\nIts's confusing; it does not say error, but because my aliases do not work,\nI think I did something wrong with them - I don't know what!\n\nA: Probably you defined these alias in .bashrc file:\nalias UIC = 'sudo openvpn --config ~/vpn/UIC-alopez78.ovpn'\nalias mat = 'cd /home/alexisblopez/MATLAB/R2014a/bin/'\nalias lab = './matlab'\n\nYou should edit .bashrc and remove space before and after =:\nalias UIC='sudo openvpn --config ~/vpn/UIC-alopez78.ovpn'\nalias mat='cd /home/alexisblopez/MATLAB/R2014a/bin/'\nalias lab='./matlab'\n\nsave your changes and run source .bashrc\n\nA: The error messages look interesting.\nThe lines\nbash: alias: =: not found\n\nthat is: bash gives us the message that it's builtin command, alias, gave it the message \"not found\" for something named \"=\".\nNow, alias is involved, and there is a = in a place where it is mistaken for a command. For the = to be treated as a command, it must be a single word, with spaces.  \nAnd looking at the syntax of the command alias (see help alias below), that's wrong:\nThe = must be used without spaces around,, like this:\nalias foo='bar baz'\n\nSo, the idea is that there are alias definitions that have extra space around =, which separates the one command line argument of alias into three arguments.\nLet's make an experiment: Can we replicate your error message like this?\n$ alias mat = 'foo bar'\nbash: alias: mat: not found\nbash: alias: =: not found\nbash: alias: foo bar: not found\n\nYes!\nThe alias builtin command tries to show the definitions of the three aliases mat, =, and foo bar, as requested, and complains not to find them.\n\nSolution: read help alias, find the alias definitions, and remove the space around the =.\n\n$ help alias\nalias: alias [-p] [name[=value] ... ]\n    Define or display aliases.\n\n    Without arguments, `alias' prints the list of aliases in the reusable\n    form `alias NAME=VALUE' on standard output.\n\n    Otherwise, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE is given.\n    A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked for\n    alias substitution when the alias is expanded.\n\n    Options:\n      -p        Print all defined aliases in a reusable format\n\n    Exit Status:\n    alias returns true unless a NAME is supplied for which no alias has been\n    defined.\n\n", "Q: Can't search Google in Firefox's Start Page (about:home) Recently I changed my FF's homepage from Ubuntu start page (about:startpage) to FF start page (about:home). \nI can type into the search bar but somehow I can't search (hit Enter or click search button won't do anything): the Google logo is missing. \"Restore previous session\" also doesn't work.

In doing so, I was told to execute \"modprobe -r wlan0\" without knowing what exactly it does. Suddenly, I lose my connection to the campus Wi-Fi and cannot connect back. Please help!\n\nA: The easiest solution is to reboot your computer. The change you made is just temporary.\nIn order to fix the situation without rebooting the computer, you have to find the name of the module that drives your WiFi card and that you just unloaded. The lshw should help you. For example, on my laptop this is the stanza related to the WiFi card:\n\n      *-network DISABLED\n           description: Wireless interface\n           product: AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter\n           vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n           physical id: 0\n           bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n           logical name: wlan0\n           version: 01\n           serial: 00:08:ca:f7:af:26\n           width: 64 bits\n           clock: 33MHz\n           capabilities: bus_master cap_list rom ethernet physical wireless\n           configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k driverversion=3.16-2-amd64 firmware=N/A latency=0 link=no multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n           resources: irq:17 memory:f7900000-f797ffff memory:f7980000-f798ffff\n\n\nThe driver=ath9k piece on the next-to-last line tells me that the driver module is ath9k.

On Windows, you can suspend the computer and windows will start back, but on Ubuntu, when the computer is suspended, I can start it back on RAM, but no HDD access is allowed (probably because the hard drive is locked or encrypted)\nAfter searching through the web for that question, the only answer I found was : Use Hibernate. Indeed, when you hibernate you have to boot the computer back up which prompt the HDD login.\nMy question is what is the difference between windows and linux ? Why would suspend lock the disk ? \nAnd then, what/where should I look for a way to get that to work ? \nThanks !! \n\nA: Suspend locks the disks because the power is cut.  It is up to the computer's bios to unlock the drive again during resume.  If it fails to do so, it is a bug in your bios and you will have to hope ( don't hold your breath ) that your motherboard vendor fixes it.\n", "Q: WIFI not working on one specific wifi network I have a DELL Latitude D630 and Ubuntu 14.04.

They all worked perfectly.\nCan you please advise?\nI asked my IT department and they confirmed no changes were made to our office wifi network.

However apparently this does not apply to nano.  \nAny clue ?\n\nA: As described in this answer, add \nDefaults editor=/path/to/editor\n\nto the sudoers file.\nNote: this will only work if the file being edited contains the Defaults editor=/path/to/editor line or includes a file that contains it.\nFor example: visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/my_sudoers_extension will default to Nano.   \n\nA: The problem is not that it does not apply to nano, it's that it does not apply to the shell:  \nJust set the VISUAL environment variable:\nexport VISUAL=vim\n\nAdd this too ~/.bashrc to make it permanent.\nAs you seem to use vim in general, set both VISUAL and EDITOR:\nexport VISUAL=\"vim\"\nexport EDITOR=\"$VISUAL\"\n\nor more POSIX-correct\nVISUAL=\"vim\" ; export VISUAL\nEDITOR=\"$VISUAL\" ; export EDITOR\n\nI assume nano was the value of one or both variables.\nTo make use of the editor in visudo actually, we need to handle that sudo does not keep the environment variables by normally.

The rest should have worked.\n  You will have continuous problems with names containing special characters like quotes, but if the requirement is to install to such a name, your approach to simply do the install to a normal directory, then rename it at the end is a good one.  You avoid all the nonsense with the required quoting in your script, and let the end uses deal with it.

It cannot be in a hidden directory since the program can use a browser window to locate it and change its location.\nI would have liked to place it in a \"well-known\" folder like /var or /opt - but I get errors when trying to open it through code, with a command like \nFILE *resource = fopen(path, \"r+\");\n\nWhat is a good location for a resource, preinstalled, non-read-only, accessible to all users and modifiable through code, not hidden (should be able to browse to it) ?\nUpdate: I was able to place my resources in /srv/MyCompany/MyProduct thanks to the link provided in the answer below.\nI hope it is a good location ?\n\nA: The handling of configuration files is described in the XDG Base Directory Specification.\nIt defines a set of related path environment variables like XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, which define, for example, where the .config directory is by default, and how to handle it in various other controlled ways .\nVery common is obviously the form ~/.config/product_name, and when it's about only one product of the company, ~/.config/company_name would not really be different.\nBut assuming there are multiple products - I think that the structure\n~/.config/company_name/product1, ~/.config/company_name/product2...\nmakes much sense;\nI do not know whether it's described in these or related standards. But it can be that the XDG standard would see that as a normal product directory, only that it sees the whole set of software of the company as one product for that purpose.\n\nThe general standard use of the fielsystem hierarchy is described in the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy.\nAs a place for the application itself, take a look at the /opt directory; You would install the application in either /opt/company_name/product1 etc or /opt/product1 etc, both is correct according to the standard.  \nYou found out yourself that the /srv directory could be a good option.\nI agree it is the right solution - so I describe here to have it in an answer:\nThe directory /srv is similar to /opt - the standard does not say much about the subdirectory structure, you can use the same separation as above.\nWhile /opt is explicitly intended for readonly application code, like executables, static data files and documentation, /srv does not restrict much about the variability of the data; It even allows mixing files with different access permissions and variability.\nFor example, it would be acceptable to deploy files there that can be changed in place by users of the system.\nFrom Linux Filesystem Hierarchy: 1.19:\n  This main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find\n  the location of the data files for particular service, and so that\n  services which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data\n  and scripts (such as cgi scripts) can be reasonably placed. Data that\n  is only of interest to a specific user should go in that users'\n  home directory.\n\n  The methodology used to name subdirectories of /srv is unspecified as there\n  is currently no consensus on how this should be done.\n\n\nTo manage the access permissions to the data that needs to be writable to all users of the software, you should use permissions assigned to a group, that contains all the users.\nThat is true even when \"all users of that computer\" would be in this group - there are many system users that should not be able to write the data; An attacker may get access to one of the system user accounts. \n", "Q: Toshiba Laptop can't find Ubuntu on boot I just installed ubuntu via a USB to my toshiba satellite laptop.

Is it possible to do so without wiping the whole extended partition?\n\n\nA: You need to shrink the extended partition by moving the starting point higher (toward the right).  \nOnce you do this, you can grow partition 2 by extending the ending point to the right to take up the 17 GB free space that will now be outside the extended partition.\nYou should be able to do this without hurting existing partitions if you are careful and pay attention so you don't make mistakes (and if nothing unforeseen happens, such as a power failure or disk failure).\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 14.04 LTS use linux kernel 3.13? Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been released with Linux kernel 3.13 (development version) and not a stable version of the Linux kernel (3.14 or 3.12). Is thís because of many new features being added in Linux kernel 3.13? \n\nA: You are  making the assumption that odd-numbered kernel releases are unstable, which has not been true since version 2.6.x. — that’s 2003. See the History part on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel.\nThe development (unstable?) versions are now distributed in the various developers’ git trees; the thing more resembling the old odd-numbered kernels would be probably the linux-next git tree.\n\nA: You've been told that 3.13 is \"just as stable\" as 3.12 and 3.14. This is kinda-sorta true, in that the Linux kernel maintainers' policy these days is that every minor release deserves the \"stable\" label. Oh, and they idiosyncratically refer to the minor version number as the \"major revision number\". (Grade inflation, anyone?)\nThe thing that used to be called \"stable\" is now known as \"long-term maintenance\" (LTM), similar to the Ubuntu project's \"long-term service\" (LTS) designation.\nThe Linux kernel versions designated LTM are:\n2.6.32  (Dec 2009)\n3.2     (Jan 2012)\n3.4     (May 2012)\n3.10    (Jun 2013)\n3.12    (Nov 2013)\n3.14    (Mar 2014)\n3.18    (Dec 2014)\n\nContrariwise, here are the kernel versions shipped inside recent Ubuntu LTS releases:\n10.04.x  ->  2.6.32 LTM\n\n12.04.0  ->  3.2 LTM\n12.04.1  ->  3.2 LTM\n12.04.2  ->  3.5\n12.04.3  ->  3.8\n12.04.4  ->  3.11\n12.04.5  ->  3.13\n\n14.04.0  ->  3.13\n14.04.1  ->  3.13\n14.04.2  ->  3.16\n\n(Sources for 10.04: AskUbuntu, 10.04.4 release notes.)\nAs you can see, Ubuntu has not shipped a LTM version of the kernel inside their LTS release since 12.02.1 (released August 2012), and in fact they've even taken to shipping those historically \"less stable\" odd-numbered minor releases.\nBecause Ubuntu ships like clockwork every six months, and the Linux kernel's release schedule isn't tied to the calendar, the Ubuntu project has to choose whether to ship with the most recent LTM kernel (which might be several months old at that point) or to ship with the most recent \"stable\" kernel, period.\nI don't know the backstory here, but my not-very-educated guess is that from the Ubuntu project's point of view, cutting-edge hardware driver support is more valuable than LTM designation. Ubuntu focuses on the desktop market, not the server market, so \"does it support all my peripherals out of the box\" is a more important question than \"are we 100% sure it's bug-free.\"\n\nA: 3.13 was the stable version of the kernel when it was decided to be used for Ubuntu 14.04. When 14.10 is released, the newer kernel will then also be backported to the LTS release, for enablement. This has been standard practice for years.\n\nA: In the past even minor version numbers were reserved for stable kernels. This practice has been abandoned since a long time. Unstable kernel versions are now tagged with -rc<N>, where <N> is an increasing number.\n", "Q: How do I fix WLAN hot key to toggle wireless state instead of airplane mode? I've got a Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E520 laptop (model 1143-3BU). Whether running Ubuntu 14.04 or Linux Mint 17 Cinnamon, its wireless hot key Fn-F9 correctly generates the XF86WLAN keysym and reliably toggles the rfkill wlan soft block state. The problem is that the Network Settings GUI shows that Fn-F9 is toggling \"Airplane Mode\" rather than \"Wireless\" state. This means that if the GUI has been used to disable \"Wireless\", the user cannot enable wireless using what she rightly imagines to be the wireless hot key (Fn-F9).\nAs far as I can tell, Network Manager's idea of wireless state is recorded in /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state as the \"WirelessEnabled\" parameter. However, nm-applet will display wireless state as \"On\" only if that parameter is true and \"Airplane Mode\" is off (which is not always the case). But what is the exact definition of airplane mode and where is that state recorded?\nMy current hypothesis is that airplane mode is nothing but a trivial state reflecting whether all RF devices are hard or soft blocked. The problem is that this laptop only has one RF device (ie. Wi-Fi). There is no Bluetooth. If I'm correct, then having only one device managed by rfkill means XF86WLAN effectively becomes an airplane mode control instead of the WLAN control it should be.\nUnder no circumstances does toggling Fn-F9 ever change the \"WirelessEnabled\" parameter in /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state.\nThis laptop has no hardware switch for wireless and there is never a hard block reported by rfkill.\nWhether or not an Ethernet cable is connected makes no difference to this problem.\nHow do I fix this so that Fn-F9 (XF86WLAN) actually toggles WLAN state instead of airplane state?\nSome additional information:\n##### kernel ############################\nLinux 3.13.0-24-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 10 19:11:08 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n##### lspci #############################\n08:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Although Matlab started to acknowledge some of it (i. e. stop spitting out an error when I activated it), it still interacted poorly (the hanging).\nMake sure when you remove MatLab you don't just remove the files from /usr/..., but also the files in ~/.matlab.

Ubuntu packages for a given Ubuntu release are moved from archive.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com when that releases reaches end-of-life. Hence, if you wish to continue using an Ubuntu release after its end-of-life, you must modify your sources.list so that it obtains packages from old-releases.ubuntu.com. You are using Ubuntu Trusty (14.04), which will reach end-of-life in April 2019. Until then, its packages are kept on archive.ubuntu.com, and if you try to obtain them from old-releases.ubuntu.com you will get a 404 error.\nSo you should replace your sources.list with a clean one, for example this one (which is essentially the default one, but in a more condensed form) and post another question about your original problem (the one which prompted you to use that guide in the first place).\n", "Q: How should I play video in Ubuntu 14.04 My machine is unable to play any video format.

Even though /usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/ has pg_resetxlog, the system requires installing 'postgres-xc'.\napt-get install postgres-xc\nReading package lists...

This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n postgres-xc : Depends: postgres-xc-client but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nif postgres-xc depends on postgres-xc-client, why is this dependency being ignored?\nUpdate\nSlave is a VPS.

Even then, you must mkdir the empty pg_xlog.\nIf you are not using WAL archiving you must copy pg_xlog, including the WAL segment(s) created after the end of pg_stop_backup, as explained in the manual.\nI strongly suggest you use the newer pg_basebackup command to make the copy instead. It is much simpler and easier to get right. Simply enable a replication connection from the planned replica's address on the master (in `pg_hba.conf), like you would for streaming replication, then:\npg_basebackup -D /path/to/new/data/dir -X stream --write-recovery-conf -h master.server.address ...other connection options...\n\nto copy the master's data directory, including all required WAL, to the replica. It even creates a recovery.conf for you automatically.\n\npostgres-xc is not the same thing as PostgreSQL. It's a non-compatible fork of an older version of PostgreSQL that adds multi-master clustering. It's a serious bug if Ubuntu ever tells you to install postgres-xc to get PostgreSQL tools.\nNever run pg_resetxlog. The only time you should is after a serious database failure, and only then after a full backup; see the entry on database corruption on the wiki.\n", "Q: Meld Installation Ubuntu 10.10 not working I tried sudo apt-get install meld , but it showing unable to locate package meld.

Location is already mounted error? I have Ubuntu 14.04 running in dual-boot with Linux Mint 17 (both 64bit) on a brand new Dell Inspiron N4050 i3 and I'm having a serious burning issue. Everytime I try to burn something I end up with a DVD/CD that doesn't work - no matter what tool I use (Brasero, xfburn...). This happens on both distros.\nWhenever I insert a CD/DVD, I get this error:\n\"UNABLE TO MOUNT BLANK DVD-R DISC. Location is already mounted\"\n\nWhat is wrong here?\n\nA: The question is a bit unclear about the exact nature of the problem, but I have had similar problems (including the same error message) while trying to burn .iso images to DVD-R.  And I, too, was thrown off by track by the error message.\nWhat I thought might work, but doesn't (DVD is grayed out):\n\n\n*\n\n*usb-creator-gtk (Startup Disk Creator)\n\n*gnome-disks (Disks)\n\n\nWhat unexpectedly did work:\n\n\n*\n\n*nautilus (Files) -- Just drag the .iso to the file manager opened to the DVD.  When you click the Write to Disc button, it recognizes that the file is an ISO and gives you the option of burning the contents instead of the file.\n\n\nWhat also works:\n\n\n*\n\n*brasero (Brasero Disc Burner) -- this is what nautilus launches anyway\n\n*cdrecord -v /dev/cdrom filename.iso\nBy the way, I was able to get rid of the error message \"Unable to mount Blank DVD-R Disc\" \"Location is already mounted\" by using dconf-editor to disable auto-mounting as described here: How to disable automount in nautilus's preferences.  However, my impression is that the message can simply be ignored.  I would consider its presence a bug.\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: It is a harmless message.  Simply close the message window and proceed with whatever you are doing.\nCD/DVD writing.  I have plenty of \"coasters\" made by Brasero.  Xfburn works great but it won't do some things.  I added K3b to my system and it works as it does in KDE.  It adds some files which will only be used when you use K3b so they won't negatively affect your system.  K3b is the best writing software.\n\nA: First you should check whether the result is really blank\nor whether the automounter is clueless.\n(The statements \"blank\" and \"already mounted\" together\nmake few sense to me.)\nWhat do the burn programs report about the medium state ?\nMost original info can be expected from backend programs.\nFrom package \"dvd+rw-tools\":\ndvd+rw-mediainfo /dev/sr0\n\nLook for\nDisc status:           blank\n\nversus\nDisc status:           appendable\nDisc status:           complete\n\nFrom package \"xorriso\".\nxorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -toc\n\nLook for\nMedia status : is blank\n\nversus\nMedia status : is written , ...\n\nIf the burn runs with Brasero or xfburn took a plausible time\nand yielded success reports in the end, then the medium should\nnot be blank.\nIf one of above shell commands afterwards reports the medium\nas blank, then the burner had no sufficient physical effect.\n(I.e. demand replacement and hope for a better one.)\n", "Q: program install via ubuntu software centre I am running ubuntu 13.04 and when I tried to install vkaudio via the software centre I do not get the install option on the right hand side.\n\nA: Even though this application is free the license is listed as proprietary, so in order to install it you need to click on 'more info' and then 'buy' (and then log in using your Ubuntu One account credentials).\n", "Q: How do I set up ibus to use CJK input for the guest session I have searched, and there appear to be several questions from before ibus became the default input method, but they are no longer applicable.\nI want to set up the guest session to use zhuyin and pinyin input in traditional characters. This is set up in the main user account, so I copied over the ~/.config/ibus and ~/.xinput* folders to /etc/guest-session/skel, but this doesn't have any effect. \n\n\n*\n\n*Are these the right files to copy?\n\n*Is this the right place to copy them in 14.04 (with Unity)?\n\n\nA: While I'm pretty sure those are not the files to copy, I'm not able to tell which files you should copy instead.\nBut I still have a solution. Create a special purpose user as described in this tutorial and configure that user using System Settings -> Text Entry. Then replace the /etc/guest-session/skel folder with a symlink to the home directory of the special purpose user.\n", "Q: How to create a group and sets the permissions for different users?

I am preparing virtual machine disk images starting with debootstrap and going from there. \nI would like to install the grub2 software on an image - but not configure it or install it on the boot sector at all ; a later script takes care of configuration and installation proper. \nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Answering my own question - I have found I can do it like this:\necho \"grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty   boolean true\" | debconf-set-selections\nDEBIAN_FRONTEND=text apt-get -y install grub2\n\n\nA: My case may be a little different, but I had interactive questions from the installer when upgrading my freshly created VMs\nThis ruined the automation, and finding how to get rid of it was quite hard, so here is what I did around my upgrade :\nsed -i \"s/#\\ conf_force_conffold=YES/conf_force_conffold=YES/g\" /etc/ucf.conf\napt-get -y upgrade\nsed -i \"s/conf_force_conffold=YES/#conf_force_conffold=YES/g\" /etc/ucf.conf\n\nIt removes the interactivity ONLY for the time of my upgrade, which in that case, is produced by ucf, and not debconf.\nBy the way, you may also edit files manually if you prefer, but I tend to convert everything to copy/pastable, since it makes life waaaaaaaaay easier.\nI use Ubuntu 16.04\n\nA: Your question may be almost two years old, but I believe I have a better answer that I should share.\nDon't install grub2 or grub-pc. Install grub-pc-bin and grub2-common.\ngrub-install and update-grub are provided by grub2-common, but all the debconf and ucf stuff is provided by grub-pc.\nBut be warned that grub-pc is a recommended package for most (all?) kernel image packages, so you have to install the kernel image and any kernel image upgrades with the --no-install-recommends option.\nNotice the use of the --assume-yes option as well, so apt-get can run noninteractively. \nInstall:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends linux-image-virtual grub-pc-bin grub2-common\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\nsudo update-grub\n\nUpgrade:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade --assume-yes --no-install-recommends\n\nHope this helps!!\n", "Q: How to configure external IP in guest machine How to configure an external IP into a guest machine.\nThe host has eth0 (LAN) and eth1 (external IP).

Check out other answers for modern solutions first.\nThis two liner run as root will quickly find all the names and run them through a for loop that runs iptables -F to flush references to the chain then iptables -X to delete them.\nfor ufw in `iptables -L |grep ufw|awk '{ print $2 }'`; do iptables -F $ufw; done\nfor ufw in `iptables -L |grep ufw|awk '{ print $2 }'`; do iptables -X $ufw; done\n\n\nA: iptables noob here, so please bear with me.\nI know this is an older topic, but it helped me get on the right track.\nTL;DR neither of the options presented by either @wjdp or @david-boho worked for me and I eventually found this comment on serverfault (hope I'm allowed to cross-share) delete a ip chain and all its references by user Steven Monday:\nTry this: iptables-save | grep -v i_XXXXX_i | iptables-restore – Steven Monday Apr 2 '12 at 19:01\n\nReplacing \"i_XXXXX_i\" with \"ufw-\" it did the job.\nHopefully needless to say I first backed up my iptables:\n iptables-save > ~/iptables-old\n\nFor my longer tale:\n@wjdp : I think the first reason yours may appear to not work properly is that some of the output from \"iptables -L\" comes out as $1 instead of $2\neg:\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nufw-before-logging-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere            \nufw-before-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere          \n\nthis throws an error:\niptables: No chain/target/match by that name.\n\nI used:\nfor ufw in `iptables -L | grep -oE \"(^| )ufw[^ ]*( |$)\" | awk '{ print $1}'`; do iptables -F $ufw; done\nfor ufw in `iptables -L | grep -oE \"(^| )ufw[^ ]*( |$)\" | awk '{ print $1}'`; do iptables -X $ufw; done\n\nhowever, on investigation, it appears I was simply creating duplicates as the rule was re-referred to in the policy (appears as $1) and in the rule itself ($2).\nA simple mod to your commands to get clean output would be:\nfor ufw in `iptables -L | grep -E  ^Chain.*ufw | awk '{ print $2 }'`; do iptables -F $ufw; done\nfor ufw in `iptables -L | grep -E  ^Chain.*ufw | awk '{ print $2 }'`; do iptables -X $ufw; done\n\nI, however, then got the following errors when running -X (after having run -F):\niptables v1.8.2 (nf_tables):  CHAIN_USER_DEL failed (Device or resource busy): chain ufw-before-logging-input\niptables v1.8.2 (nf_tables):  CHAIN_USER_DEL failed (Device or resource busy): chain ufw-before-logging-output\n\nI then tried @david-boho's \"-D\" option and got the following error:\niptables: Bad rule (does a matching rule exist in that chain?).\n\n(I added an echo to David's command, and confirmed the names were indeed valid)\nIt was after this that I found Steven's solution that worked perfectly for me.\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: postfix/submission/smtpd Relay Access Denied Getting error 'Relay access denied'\nAt outlook, set port 587 for smtp and 993 for imap at Ubunut LTS.\nMy configuration is:\n    root@server:~# postconf -n\nappend_dot_mydomain = no\nbiff = no\nbroken_sasl_auth_clients = yes\nconfig_directory = /etc/postfix\ndisable_vrfy_command = yes\ndovecot_destination_recipient_limit = 1\ninet_interfaces = all\nmailbox_size_limit = 0\nmessage_size_limit = 0\nmydestination =\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128\nmynetworks_style = host\nmyorigin = /etc/mailname\nqueue_directory = /var/spool/postfix\nreadme_directory = no\nrecipient_delimiter = +\nrelayhost =\nsmtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache\nsmtp_use_tls = yes\nsmtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name\nsmtpd_delay_reject = yes\nsmtpd_helo_required = yes\nsmtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes\nsmtpd_sasl_local_domain =\nsmtpd_sasl_path = private/auth\nsmtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\nsmtpd_sasl_type = cyrus\nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks,permit smtpd_relay_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, defer_unauth_destination\nsmtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/certs/smtpd.cert\nsmtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/private/smtpd.key\nsmtpd_tls_security_level = may\nsmtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache\nsmtpd_use_tls = yes\nvirtual_alias_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-maps.cf\nvirtual_mailbox_base = /var/vmail\nvirtual_mailbox_domains = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-mailbox-domains.cf\nvirtual_mailbox_limit = 0\nvirtual_mailbox_maps = proxy:mysql:$config_directory/mysql-virtual-mailbox-maps.cf\nvirtual_transport = dovecot\n\n\nA: Add something like this to your main.cf:\nsmtpd_relay_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated,\n    permit_mynetworks,\n    reject_unauth_destination\n\n\nA: corrected \nsmtpd_sasl_type = cyrus\n\nto\nsmtpd_sasl_type = dovecot\n\n", "Q: Replace Light Locker with Gnome screensaver There have been many issues reported concerning Light Locker.

I already have several MySQL DBs running on my Ubuntu 14.04 Server, and I would like to migrate these as smoothly as possible to the compatible MariaDB. I'm also using PHPMyAdmin.

What to do? I have a Olympus SP-720UZ camera and i want to install the software that came with the camera, on the olympus website, there are only options for windows and mac, how do i install it on ubuntu ?\n\nA: With Ubuntu, you don't need the software that came with the camera. As you found out most camera manufacturers don't provide a software for Linux. They don't need to, as Ubuntu has the needed software already installed.\nJust connect the camera and it should be recognized. If that does not work, or if you prefer, you can also take the SD card out and put it in a card reader. \nEither way, Ubuntu has built-in software called Shotwell Photo Manager to recognize and import the pictures into your computer. Then you can use Shotwell to view edit, and share the pictures.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: why can the terminal not find my executable Hey all i have been experimenting with make and Ubuntu 14.04 in order to automate the build \ni have created 2 simple programs\ntest2.exe\ntest2.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    printf(\"%s\",\"Built using make\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nand test.exe\nmain.c\nextern int print();\n\nint _start()\n{\n    print();\n    return 0;\n}\n\ntest.c\nint print()\n{\n    printf(\"%s\",\"Built using make\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nMakefile\nprint:\n    gcc -Wall test.c -c -o test.o\n    gcc -Wall main.c -c -o main.o\n    ld -o test.exe test.o main.o -lc    \ntest:\n    gcc -Wall test2.c -o test2.exe\n\nthe issue that i am experiencing is that the terminal cannot find test.exe with the command ./test.exe but finds test2.exe fine with ./test2.exe\nthe error it gives me is bash: ./test.exe: No such file or directory\nwhen it is clearly there in the directory.\nI am calling make print to build test.exe and make test to build test2.exe\nwhy is this happening\nedit in response to the comments the output of ls ld test.exe is\nls: cannot access ld: No such file or directory\nls: cannot access test.exe: No such file or directory\n\nThe output of make print\ngcc -Wall test.c -c -o test.o\ngcc -Wall main.c -c -o main.o\n\nld -o test.exe test.o main.o -lc\nAnt the output of make test\ngcc -Wall test.c -o test2.exe**\nscreenshot of directory\n\nScreenshot of ls output\n\nls -q output\n\n\nA: When you look at the file listing in Nautilus (or run ls with no arguments), it shows a file whose name appears to be test.exe.\nBut when you pass test.exe as an argument to ls, it does not find it, and outputs the error:\nls: cannot access test.exe: No such file or directory\n\nThe most probable explanation is that the file's name is displayed as test.exe, but that is not actually its name.\nThis can happen when a file's name contains non-printing characters. You can verify this hypothesis by running ls -q. If a file with one or more ? is shown, whose name is otherwise similar to test.exe, that confirms the problem. If not, the problem likely has some other cause.\nSince you have a graphical desktop and Nautilus displays the file, the easiest way to fix the problem is probably to rename it to test.exe in Nautilus.\nIn the file browser window, right-click the file whose name appears to be test.exe. Click \"Rename...\" to edit the filename. Press Ctrl+A to select the entire name, and press Delete or Backspace to clear it. (Or just start typing the new name and it will overwrite it.) Type test.exe. Press Enter.\nThen try running your program again.\n\nIf that solved the problem, the question immediately arises as to how a non-printing character got into the filename. Since the filename was specified in Makefile, perhaps you accidentally pasted or otherwise entered input into your text editor containing a control character.\nYou can remove and replace test.exe in Makefile to fix the problem there.\nIf renaming the file in Nautilus did not solve the problem--or if ls -q didn't show any ? characters--please edit your question to update it with detailed information about what did happen, and work on the problem can continue.\n", "Q: How can I recover data deleted during installation of Ubuntu? i got a big trouble this is my first day with ubuntu.\nwhile installing ubuntu the participation of the hard disk was deleted and it contains a big project ( i worked on that project about 5 months and i have no copy for it.).\nplease help me.\nis there any way to return my project.\nbad starting with ubuntu :'( \ntell me is there any way to return it.\ni search for programs to return files but they are only for windows.\nand that project for the 08 of October so i need it immediately.\n\nA: First STOP USING THE DISK.\nThen boot from a live USB.

I mean it's entering into all odd folders and not entering into even folders.\nCode in install.sh\nfor f in apps/*;\n  do \n     [ -d $f ] && cd \"$f\" && echo Entering into $f and installing packages\n     cd ..\n  done; \n\n\nA: You can use find along with exec for this propose. Your install.sh should be  \n#!/bin/bash\nfind ./apps -type d -exec echo Entering into {} and installing packages \\; \n\nreplace text after -exec with your command\nfor example \n#!/bin/bash\nfind ./apps -type d -exec touch {}/test.txt  \\;  \n\nIt will loop through app and all its sub-directories and will create a text.txt file\n\nA: Use full path of your parent directory(in my case apps directory located in my home directory) and remove one extra command(cd ..)\nfor dir in ~/apps/*;\n  do \n     [ -d \"$dir\" ] && cd \"$dir\" && echo \"Entering into $dir and installing packages\"\n  done;\n\nSee screenshot: with cd .. command and using apps/*\n\nSee screenshot: without cd .. command and using ~/apps/*\n\n", "Q: OpenSSH - Restrict users to one or multiple folders I want to know how I can restrict user access using OpenSSH Server.\nLet's say I want \n\n\n*\n\n*user 1 to only access /Media, /Documents, and his home folder,\n\n*User 2 should only access /Folder21, and his homefolder,\n\n*User 3 should only have access to /Documents, /Folder21 and his home folder,\n\n\nHow can I do such a thing? \nI found how to do it with one folder, but that was for all users, I think?\n   description here: https://bensmann.no/restrict-sftp-users-to-home-folder/\n(copied from link I gave above:\nCan I just do this:\n$ usermod User1 -s /bin/false\n$ usermod User2 -s /bin/false\n\nAnd set the user’s home directory:\n$ usermod User1 -d /folder\n$ usermod User2 -d /folder\n\nthen make all the other folders subfolders of /folder, and restrict access to those folders accordingly to my wishes using the chmod command, or is there a better solution??\nAddition and clarification:\nAdding it to their homedirectory is not an option, as it are shared folders, some users need access to the same content,while it is restricted to other users,\nThis is what I had in mind: \n\n\n*\n\n*user 1\n\n*user 2  \n\n*user 3\n\n*user 4\n\n*folder \"Network documentation\"\n\n*folder \"application documentation\"\n\n*folder \"Downloads\"\n\n*folder \"Media\"\n\n*User 1 needs full access to everything, but Read-only access to application documentation List item\n\n*User 2 needs full access to both documentation folders\n\n*User 3 only needs access to the \"Media\" folder\n\n*User 4 only needs access to the folder \"Downloads\" and \"Application Documentation\"\n\n\nA: Could you not just put whatever folders you want each user to access in their home directory? If not, I believe that ssh uses the same file permissions as the file system on the computer. So you can just use the same file permissions modifiers you would use to give a user access to a folder outside their home directory, like this:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/280994/give-write-permissions-to-multiple-users-on-a-folder-in-ubuntu\n\nA: You could do a simple permissions control system.\nFirst off, you need a directory tree, so let's do this:\n~ (Home Folder\n|\n|---> Their Files\n|\n|---> Symlink to /opt/public/\n\nIn /opt/public/, you have all of your folders. In this case,\n\n\n*\n\n*Media\n\n*Documents\n\n*Folder51\nAs you only have three users (and three folders), you could create groups.\nA simple way to do this is to create a group for each folder. For instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*groupadd opt-public-media-access\n\n*groupadd opt-public-documents-access\n\n*groupadd opt-public-folder51-access\nNow, add the users to the specific groups (in this case, user1 is going to the media group.)\nusermod -a -G opt-public-media-access user1\n\nFinally, run these commands on each folder to secure read/write perms to the specific group only:\nchown -R root:opt-public-media-access /opt/public/Media\nchmod 770 -R /opt/public/Media/\n\nAdd and remove groups/folders at will. A few things to note, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command to remove groups is groupdel. You should delete the group when you delete the folder.\n\n*Other users on the system not in the proper group will not be able to get into those folders, regardless.\n\n*Give each user their own home folder. Do not place it into something like /opt/public.\n\n*Root can go wherever he wants. Make sure none of the users have sudo rights.\n\n*All commands in this post are meant to be run as root, unless otherwise specified.\n\n", "Q: How do I gain access of my files again? Hello,I know I shouldn't have, but I've interrupted the upgrade from Ubuntu 12.10 to 14.10 and now I can't go past the login screen... When I try to launch Ubuntu in recovery mode, it displays an error message and I can't even connect to the internet. I've looked for solutions but found none and don't really want to burn a better installation cd.The real problem is that I can't access my session! I installed ubuntu on another partition and tried to copy all of my documents onto a usb drive but since I'm on another session, I am not the owner of my files!The title says it all; please help! I really need my files back!\n\nA: You can open a terminal and run sudo nautilus.\nYou should gain access to your files.\n\nA: Try running:\nsudo chown -R /path/to/my/folder $USER:$USER\n\nThis will change the owner of the directory to give you access again.\n", "Q: Problem with Wireless Driver of Lenovo T540p Laptop I've installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 to my laptop.

It won't play in Ubuntu - in fact, Ubuntu only sees an empty disc! This is on 2 separate computers at home running Ubuntu 13.x and 14.x, respectively. The player is VLC but the built-in media player doesn't see any content either.\nI loaded the DVD in a Windows computer and it plays just fine there, using VLC. I tried using handbrake to make a backup of it but Handbrake doesn't see any content.\nIs it normal that Ubuntu can't play Disney DVDs? How can I get around this?\nI'd like to rip the DVD to my harddisk; that's how we view all our other DVD's. Failing that, I'd at least want to be able to play the DVD on Ubuntu...\n\nA: As Xangua said, you need to download libdvdcss to play some restricted dvds.

information about this software through a quick web search, so I don't know if the recommended installation method involves a configuration step before running make. If it does, ./configure isn't the way, since there is no such file. Not all software built with make has a configure script.\nNormally I'd recommend consulting the README (or similarly named) file, but it appears there might not be one.\nThere are three common ways software shipped with a makefile is built:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running ./configure (and then after that, running other commands, usually make). But that doesn't appear to apply here. When there is such a script, usually it generates (or occasionally, customizes) Makefile.\n\n*Manually editing Makefile. That might be the intended way for this software. Makefile does already exist.\n\n*Just running make. That might be the intended way for this software. Makefile appears to be written in such a way that it will build the software even without being changed in any way first. To verify this, since I'm not an expert in makefile syntax and semantics, I saved its contents as Makefile in an empty directory and ran make. This attempted to run compilation commands (which of course failed because I didn't have the rest of the files), suggesting that your source code archive may ship with a ready-to-go makefile.\n\n\nIn short, if you haven't tried just running make yet, try that.\n\nIt appears that when you ran make, there were no errors and it created an executable called g++ -o casa-1.1b:\ng++ -o casa-1.1b common/utility/PascalTriangle.o common/utility/Combinadic.o common/utility/CombinadicIterator.o minisat/solver/Solver.o casa/sat/SAT.o casa/io/Usage.o casa/io/SpecificationFile.o casa/io/ConstraintFile.o casa/io/OutputFile.o casa/covering/state/CoveringArray.o casa/covering/state/CoveringArrayEntry.o casa/covering/state/CoveringArrayRow.o casa/covering/state/CoveringArraySubRow.o casa/covering/space/CoveringArraySpace.o casa/covering/space/SingleChangeSpace.o casa/covering/space/GraftSpace.o casa/covering/bookkeeping/Options.o casa/annealing/Anneal.o casa/annealing/AnnealingSuccess.o casa/annealing/Bounds.o casa/annealing/AnnealingPartitioner.o casa/algorithms/BinarySearch.o casa/Main.o\n\nThat command links all the .o files (created by compiling the individual .c files in the source code archive) together into the program casa-1.1b.\nIt appears this file is just in the same directory where you ran make, since the g++ command that produced it appears to specify paths relative to that folder. Running ./casa-1.1b while in that directory may work to run the program.\nIf so, you can run it from there or manually copy the necessary files to install it. (That executable might be the only file you have to copy, or there may be others.)\n", "Q: Can't find wine1.6.2 after adding a ppa I am installing wine 1.6.2 on Ubuntu 12.04, following this link  http://www.tecmint.com/install-wine-on-ubuntu-and-linux-mint/\n\nInstallation of Wine 1.6.2 To install Wine, open the terminal by\n  hitting ‘CTRL + ALT + T‘ from the desktop and run the following\n  commands one-by-one on the terminal.\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install wine1.6\n$ sudo apt-get install winetricks\n\n\nBut \n$ sudo apt-get install wine1.6\n[sudo] password for tim: \nReading package lists...

If you look at the wine ppa right now in Wine PPA for 12.04 you will noticed the last update for the 1.6.x was the 1.6.1, or to be more precise, the 1:1.6.1-0ubuntu1~ppa1~precise1\nYou will also noticed that it offers that 1.7.x versions but up to 1.7.18, when on 14.04 it offers the 1.7.27 which is the latest version. I recommend jumping to either a new version of Ubuntu (14.04 or the next 14.10 when it comes out) to have the latest wine version. I also recommend removing 1.6.x and installing 1.7 (or 1.8 when it comes out), since there are more than 500+ enhancements compared to 1.6.x\nOf course, in the case you want to have the latest wine. If not you can stay in 12.04 and stick with either the current 1.6.x or jump to 1.7.\n", "Q: Refusal to Boot; Fixed Through Recovery; No Idea what Happened Right now I'm using the latest version of Lubuntu 14, fyi. \nAnyhow, I'm not suffering a problem right now, but due to my lack of knowledge on the issue I'm not exactly sure if it's fixed either, and would like some input but I have no idea what the heck happened and how the heck I fixed it. \nYesterday my laptop worked fine all day. Today when I tried booting it up, it refused to do so, as after it got past the BIOs splash screen it would only take me to a black screen where I could type, but none of the typing seemed to do anything. \nRebooting did nothing, so after awhile, purely through trial and error, I managed to get the computer into recovery mode and with an educated guess I selected the option for it to repair broken packages. \nDuring the repair it tossed out tons of code I couldn't comprehend, such as SRST failed (errna=-16), and eventually it got to the log-in screen, where I got through and everything was fine. \nHowever, lacking a proper diagnosis I have no idea what was wrong in the first place. It was saying something about a new GRUB (...?), so my guess is the last time I did a sudo apt-get update, it installed a dysfunctional update to the bootloader and messed everything up. \nIn this case, how can I find out what went wrong, and prevent it from happening again, if possible?\n\nEdit\nEven with another round of updates and an attempt to fix matters through recovery mode, it's still happening. This time around I took more careful note of what went on: \n1.) I turn the computer on, and after a long pause it takes me to a black screen where I can type, but none of the inputs do anything. \n2.) Forced restart.\n3.) The second time I boot up something different happens: I'm taken to a screen that states it's \"GNU GRUB version 2.02^beta2-9\". \n4.) I select advanced Ubuntu options from there.\n5.) I select to boot in recovery mode. \n6.) I select to fix broken packages (which I found doesn't do anything). \n7.) Finally, I select to do a normal boot of Ubuntu, which then takes me to the usual log-in screen where everything is fine. \nSo in short, my comptuer won't boot up normally. I have to take these steps through GRUB to boot up via the recovery mode selection menu, which doesn't make sense to me. \nAnd again, I haven't been doing any tinkering with my system aside from the usual sudo apt-get update, so I suspect I downloaded something corrupt. \nSo what should I do? \n\nEdit II\nI tried Boot Repair, and that that didn't work either. Here's the URL it gave me: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8496242\n\nEdit III\nDid Boot Repair again, and this time it spat out an entirely different code. http://paste.ubuntu.com/8503260\n\nA: This seems like your GRUB config (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) file was removed, corrupted, or misconfigured.\nGenerally, powering on your computer would do it's initialization and then load GRUB from the boot sector of your hard disk, and that would then load the GRUB configuration which tells it where to find your initial RAM disk on your drive.\nThis is usually loaded, which then reads your Linux install and boots normally.\nWith a corrupted or missing GRUB file, this chain breaks which tends to result in a simple black screen with\nboot:\n\nRecovery has a few options here.\nYou could manually pass options to GRUB at this stage, telling it where your initial RAM disk is. \nRecovery mode (which you used) loads Linux from a CD and will then probe your disk and attempt to intelligently build a GRUB config for you. If detected, it will also install GRUB to the disks boot loader.\nThis process can be done manually using update-grub or grub-install, which can come in handy in situations where an update breaks for some reason and you can tell that you won't come back without handling GRUB. In this case, those two tools can be used to essentially do the same thing that Recovery Mode would do, but on your system that's already booted and running.\n", "Q: Different wallpapers on multiple monitors I have a laptop and a monitor. Most of the time my laptop is connected to the monitor over HDMI. I use Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 and here is what I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*When no monitor is connected I want a simple background image\n\n*When the monitor is connected I would like to have the same background image on my laptop and another one on my monitor.\n\n\nIs that possible? I found this question as well as nitrogen. But both didn't help me.\nEdit:\n\nAfter running gnome-tweak-tool, go to the \"Desktop\" tab in the left-side panel and then turn off the setting \"Have file manager handle the desktop\".\n\nSource: Ubuntu Forums.\nUnfortunately I am unable to find this in my Gnome-Tweak-Tool:\n\nI tried to find the same configuration using dconf-editor under org.gnome.desktop.background but all it said was:\n\nSummary:     Draw Desktop Background\n  Description: Have GNOME draw the desktop background. DEPRECATED: This key is deprecated and ignored.\n\nAlso my gnome-shell --version is GNOME Shell 3.10.4.\nIn this gist is the output of xrandr. First one is with the second monitor connected. Second one is without it.\n\nA: The trick\nIt seems impossible to separately set wallpapers for the main screen and the second screen. What can be done however is to set a wallpaper, and have it spanned over two screens. We can automatically create a spanning image of two wallpapers of your choice and (also automatically) switch the wallpaper and the picture options, depending on whether the second screen is connected or not. \nTo make it look nice, it is necessary that at least the vertical screen resolution of both screens is identical, which is the case in your situation.\n\nIn practice\nPreparation\nIn this solution, The preparing work you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install imagemagick to automaically create the spanning image:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\n\n*Prepare two separate background images of your choice for both the screens:\n\n\n*\n\n*The dimensions should exactly match the screen's dimensions (16:9 in your case)\n\n*The vertical resolution of both images should be exactly the same.\n\n\ncall them screen_1.jpeg and screen_2.jpeg (exactly those names). A script will create the spanning image.\n\n*Create a folder in your home directory and copy both images into the folder. \n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file and save it as auto_wall.py, together with the two images you prepared.\n\n*In the head section of the script, there is a line:\nscreen_check = \"HDMI-0 connected\"\n\nif necessary, replace HDMI-0 by <your_second_screenname> (run the command xrandr if necessary to find out)\nRun the script (and keep it running in the background) by the command:\npython3 /path/to/auto_wall.py\n\nNow if you connect your second screen, the wallpaper on your second screen should switch within a few seconds to screen_2.jpeg you prepared.\n\n\n*\n\n*If all works well, add it to your startup applications.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\ncurr_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nscreen_check = \"HDMI-0 connected\"\n\nsingle_picture = \"'file://\"+curr_dir+\"/screen_1.jpeg'\"\ndouble_picture = \"'file://\"+curr_dir+\"/span_image.jpeg'\"\n\ndef execute_set(command):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\ndef execute_get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef switch_tosingle():\n    execute_set(\"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"+single_picture)\n    execute_set(\"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options zoom\")\n\ndef switch_todouble():\n    if not os.path.exists(double_picture):\n        create_spanimage()\n    execute_set(\"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"+double_picture)\n    execute_set(\"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options spanned\")\n\ndef create_spanimage():\n    image_1 = curr_dir+\"/\"+\"screen_1.jpeg\"\n    image_2 = curr_dir+\"/\"+\"screen_2.jpeg\"\n    span_image = curr_dir+\"/\"+\"span_image.jpeg\"\n    execute_set(\"convert \"+image_1+\" \"+image_2+\" \"+\"+append \"+span_image)\n\ndef check_ifconnected():\n    command = \"xrandr\"\n    check = execute_get(command)\n    if screen_check in check:\n        return True\n\ndef check_wallpaper():\n    check = execute_get(\"gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\")\n    if check == single_picture:\n        return \"single\"\n    elif check == double_picture:\n        return \"double\"\n\ndef arrange():\n    test = (check_ifconnected(), check_wallpaper())\n    if test == (True, \"double\") or test == (False, \"single\"):\n        pass\n    elif test[0] == True:\n        switch_todouble()\n    else:\n        switch_tosingle()\n\nwhile True:\n    arrange()\n    time.sleep(5)\n\nReplacing images\nIn case you want to change wallpaper(s), just replace one or both of the images you copied to the folder (but mind the name) and remove the span_image.jpeg, created by the script.\nI tested it on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10, and it worked perfectly. The fact that you use Gnome should not make a difference.\nSwitching wallpaper settings manually with a key combination\nIf, for some reason, you would prefer to switch to the spanned wallpaper manually after connecting / disconnecting the external monitor, you can replace the last three lines:\nwhile True:\n    arrange()\n    time.sleep(5)\n\nby a single line:\narrange()\n\nand add a keyboard shortcut to do the switch: \"System Settings\" > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\"\nAdd the command:\npython3 /path/to/auto_wall.py\n\nto a key combination of your choice.\n\nA: In addition on the above answer, you can join two exact size images by using this service : http://www.photojoiner.net/\nAfter you joined two or more images, you should select \"span\" option in the background settings page.\n\nA: Sometimes I use \neog --fullscreen -s <path to first pic>\n\non the second monitor to keep a constantly changing backround there.

I'm a Linux noob who had an extra 250GB Hard Drive lying around. I have Windows installed on my main 1TB Hard Drive, and I'm going to install Ubuntu on the second 250GB Hard Drive. What I want to know, is there a way to choose between the two on boot? Don't make fun of me, but on my old Macbook Pro I had Os X and Windows both installed, and I could hit a combination of keys during startup, and I could choose what OS to boot into. Is there a way to do that with Linux? If there are any programs I could install to give me that choice, please point me in the right direction! I've heard of a thing called GRUB, but I'm not really sure what it does. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\nA: When you install ubuntu on your other hard drive, it will (by default) automatically install grub, which is a bootloader. It will do exactly what you want. After installation, just go to your bios and set your default boot drive to the second one (with ubuntu install). When you boot you'll see a screen with a few different options to boot. It will look like this but with another option below to boot into windows: \n\nIt will by default boot into ubuntu after 10 seconds if no key is pressed, but you can just use the arrow keys to navigate and enter to choose whether to boot into windows or Ubuntu. \n\nA: If you install Ubuntu, it will install grub also. \nYou have to do nothing. \nGrub will recognize both Windows and Ubuntu disks. \nYou no need a combination of keys during boot. \nIt will automatically load grub and will give you the option to select which OS you want to boot to. \n", "Q: What is the point of the \".list\" files on the releases.ubuntu.com pages?

That identifies the package for removal as the 32-bit version of bash, which is the one you're saying you don't want and which is the one you probably don't need. You definitely do need bash for your architecture (amd64)--even if all users use a different interactive shell, many other packages in Ubuntu depend on it.\nMore details about the current situation, and the \"remove\" action:\nThe leading i means it's marked to be installed, so it does make sense to want to clear that line in the output of dpkg -l.\nThe purge action (as fkraiem suggested) should work fine too, though it's probably unnecessary (compared to remove).

Nouveau was working just fine, I was just attempting to make it so that I was able to run CS:S (no need for explanation on that.)\nLong story short, I went and downloaded the Intel Graphic Drivers for Linux* from here. After downloading and installing the .deb, I ran intel-linux-graphics-installer which opened up a window that downloaded & installed the open Intel drivers. I then rebooted, and it's slow. Very slow, especially on 3D effects and when I hit Alt+Tab.\nNow, I don't know if the previously installed Nouveau drivers are conflicting with these new Intel drivers (if that's the issue, what should I do about fixing it?) What I do know is that my system isn't behaving right and I want it to (obviously.) If removing the Nouveau drivers isn't the solution, how can I safely remove the just-installed Intel drivers?\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: On some computers the new versions that are installed with the intel-linux-graphics-installer have those exact same issues, I had it happen with two netbooks so it dosn't seem to be a conflict between nouveau/intel but a problem with the newer graphics installed from Intel.\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to remove the source that Intel installed automatically when you ran the installer.

How to remove the starter? The \"panel\" on the left side of your screen with all the icons on it - icons like Firefox, LibreCalc and so on. I have installed \"docky\" - so it would be great to delete the left panel.\nBy the way: Docky blocks for the Firefox window. Is it possible to make the Firefox window go behind the docky panel?\nKind regards!\n\nA: Open System Settings -> Appearance > Behavior tab and enable the Auto Hide.  This will hide the panel and reveal itself when the mouse hits that side of the screen.  The sensitivity of how hard the mouse has to hit for it to reveal is on the same screen and you can adjust that.\nIf you never want it to show, enabling auto hide, and turning the sensitivity all the way to low will give you the best results.  However it will still reveal if you hit the side hard enough.\nYou can install a package called Unity Tweak Tool from the software center, or by running sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool and the Launcher settings in that application provide a way to change the reveal location from the entire side, to the just the top corner.\nThat's about all you can do to stay away from it as much as possible, and doing the above will do a pretty good job.  However, that launcher is a pretty important part of the Unity desktop environment, and if you don't like it, perhaps another desktop environment will suit your workflow more; something like Gnome, XFCE, or KDE.\n", "Q: Can I use a Debian package build environment to build Ubuntu packages?

More importantly I'd like to know how I can ask Apt-Get to honour the constraints without having to manually replicate the package metadata onto my apt-get parameters.\n\nA: What you're experiencing is the problem with apt / apt-get not being as smart as you think it is.\nThis problem happens when trying to downgrade your package(s) or install an older package version than the version the repositories have as the latest candidate (with regard to your apt priority pinning and other policies regarding repository priorities).  When you downgrade your package, you actually have to specify for each individual dependency which version you're downgrading to, or in this case which specific version you actually want to install.\nIn the case of the nginx packages, where nginx-full and nginx-common depend on each other, you have to explicitly tell apt to install each of the packages of the specified version(s).  This is because 1.7.6-1+trusty1 supersedes 1.7.5-1+trusty1 by version number.  As a result, you have to specifically say \"Only install the package of this specific version\" because of the superseded version(s) existing, i.e. apt-get install nginx-full=1.7.5-1+trusty1 nginx-common=1.7.5-1+trusty1\nNot relevant to your question, but this also happens when you install from a repository that has a lower apt pinning priority than another version, in which case you have to specify the versions and/or source(s) to install from manually, i.e. sudo apt-get install nginx-full/trusty-proposed nginx-common/trusty-proposed being a prime example of trying to install a package and dependencies from the proposed repository, which has a much lower apt priority than PPAs or the main repositories.\n", "Q: Removing Ubuntu from boot manager I have a similar problem like in this post.\nThe answer there suggests using the 4 commands:\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr -b X -B\n\nAt first, I had the boot manager looking like this: (2 Ubuntu entries)\n\nI got a Live Ubuntu CD and booted from it to use Try Ubuntu and enter the above commands.\nIn boot mode settings I had 2 choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Legacy Boot Mode, Secure Boot Off\n\n*UEFI Boot Mode, Secure Boot Off\n\n\nAs in the picture:\n\nChoosing the first one, allowed me to boot from the CD and log into Ubuntu (Trial mode).

I suspect zsh  wasn't installed and that's why things broke. This seems especially likely2 if the error you saw on the new terminal was:\nbash: /usr/bin/lesspipe: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nMaking /bin/sh a link to dash again (as it is by default on Ubuntu) is usually the appropriate solution--and in your case, as your goal is to restore your system to the way it was before, it is definitely the correct way. It can be achieved by booting from live media, as presented in Termhn's excellent answer1, and in other ways.\nBut if for some bizarre reason you did want to use zsh instead of dash for /bin/sh in Ubuntu, this can be achieved--but not quite the way you attempted it.\nRestoring sh→dash Without a Live Environment\nI think using a live CD/DVD/USB is the overall best solution to this problem, because it's less technical than other ways and is very likely to succeed without problems.\nBut in case you want to fix this just by booting from the hard disk, you can.\nThis is somewhat less long and complicated than it might seem at first glance, as a good bit of length is due to (a) presenting two alternatives, and (b) the screenshots.\nFirst, shut down or reboot cleanly (if you can).\nThis applies to all solutions, not just those that attempt to fix the problem while still booting from the internal hard drive. But it's probably not a big problem if you didn't do this.\nDepending on how badly broken things are, Ctrl+Alt+Delete might not successfully shut down and reboot your Ubuntu system. (Ordinarily it does that, if pressed when in a text-based virtual console.)\nIf Ctrl+Alt+Delete doesn't work, use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+SysRq+REISUB to reBoot, or\n\n*Alt+SysRq+REISUO to power Off.\n\n\nSince problems caused by a missing /bin/sh shouldn't cause failures deep in the kernel, I think these \"magic SysRq\" techniques will always work in this situation.\ninit=/bin/dash Should Work\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down Shift while booting to get a GRUB menu.\n\nIt should very generally resemble this screenshot, but may be expected to look different depending on which Ubuntu flavor and release you're running.\n\n*\"Ubuntu\" is selected by default. Keep that selection, but press e to edit it.\n(Don't worry, your edit is just for this boot, and will not be saved.)\n\n*Move to the end of the line that beginning linux        /boot/vmlinuz-.... (You can use the arrow keys, and End to get to the end of the line.)\n\nType a space, then init=/bin/dash. Then press F10 to boot this configuration.\nSource: How to set NOMODESET and other kernel boot options in grub2\n\n*You should see:\n/bin/dash: 0: can't access tty: job control turned off\n#\n\nThis is a root shell.\n\n*Remount the root filesystem readwrite so you can make changes to files on disk:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nThis command, and the ones that follow it, will (usually) not produce any output when they succeed. That's okay.\n\n*Make /bin/sh a symlink to dash instead of zsh:\ncd /bin\nrm sh\nln -s dash sh\n\n\n*If you like, you can check that the sh symlink has been properly retargeted by running ls -l sh, which should show something like:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Oct  2 23:13 sh -> dash\n\n(sh -> dash is the key part.)\n\n*Restart with reboot -f. Your system should be fixed.\nAlternative way: Recovery mode might work. Maybe.\nIt may be possible for recovery mode to function without sh. I haven't gotten this to work myself and don't actually know if it ever does--I got Ubuntu to boot normally (without a GUI) with sh as a broken symlink, but that stopped working for me before I tried recovery mode (which didn't work for me either).\nFor a more reliable way, go back up to init=/bin/dash Should Work. (Note that recovery mode is not at all unreliable in general, it just can't be expected to work without /bin/sh.)\nIf you want to attempt recovery mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*To enter recovery mode, hold down Shift during boot to get a GRUB menu.\n\n*Select Advanced options for Ubuntu.\n\n*In the menu of available kernels, press ↓ to move the selection to an entry ending in (recovery mode), and press Enter.\n\n\n*If it doesn't work, you can reboot with \"magic SysRq\" as detailed above. If it does work, you'll see the Recovery Menu.\n\n*In the Recovery Menu, press ↓ repeatedly until \nroot              Drop to root shell prompt\n\nis selected. Press Enter.\n\n\n*Perform steps 5 and 6 (and optional step 7, if you like) from the init=/bin/dash Should Work method above.\n\n*Run reboot to restart.\nYou could probably run exit, then select Resume. But I suggest rebooting instead, so the system can boot cleanly with an accessible and functioning sh from the very start. (If you managed to get into recovery mode with sh as a broken symlink, that still doesn't mean everything worked just right along the way.)\n\nIf you're interested in making zsh provide sh (either for real, or just theoretically), read on.\nProblems With The sh→zsh Procedure You Attempted\nAs a general procedure, cd /bin; rm sh; ln -s /bin/zsh /bin/sh (as prescribed in your lab exercise) is bad advice for at least two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*/bin/zsh sometimes doesn't exist even if zsh is installed. This depends on how it was installed and what OS is being used. zsh is a large, complex shell that's not very frequently used as /bin/sh and thus ordinarily doesn't need to be accessible in single-user mode or otherwise before a separate /usr partition might be mounted. Executables not needed in single-user mode are usually located in subdirectories of /usr.\nUbuntu's zsh does provide /bin/sh. But on other systems it may be /usr/bin/zsh or even /usr/local/bin/sh (as on my FreeBSD system where I have it installed via pkg).\n\n*The motivation behind this exercise may have been to harden a system against \"Shellshock\" (or other possible parsing bugs arising from the way bash accepts shell functions passed in environment variables). But it is not a widely appropriate course of action for this purpose.\nAlthough many GNU/Linux systems, such as Fedora, RHEL, and Slackware, have bash provide /bin/sh, in many others some other shell provides /bin/sh. This includes Ubuntu, which uses dash. Like zsh, dash is not vulnerable to \"Shellshock\" and does not import function definitions from environment variables (or at all) using any mechanism, so no similar bug is likely to affect it.\nSo depending on context, this exercise as it was presented to you might have been flawed. You might want to discuss the matter with your professor. Perhaps the curriculum, or the way in which it is conveyed, could be improved.\nDepending (even more heavily) on context, these considerations may also be causes for concern:\n\n\n*\n\n*Often, sh is a symbolic link, hard link, or copy of another shell that is installed. But on some systems, particularly some Unix-like systems that are not GNU/Linux systems, sh might be a separate executable from anything else. Except when this is known not to be the case, it's a good idea to check before rming it! mving might be more appropriate in that case.\n\n*Exercises that alter a system's configuration, particular those that require running commands as root to perform unusual actions, should not typically be performed on production machines. Experimentation and exploration are both practically necessary and intrinsically valuable. But when they may involve breaking things, they are best carried out on installations whose continued functioning is not essential to important work that needs to get done. \nIn other words, it's good to test things out before deploying them \"for real.\" (Virtual machines are often good for this.)\nUbuntu's zsh  does provide a copy of the shell3 in /bin as well as /usr/bin. But by default in Ubuntu, zsh is not installed at all.\nSymbolic links don't require their targets to exist:\nek@Ilex:~$ rm foo\nrm: cannot remove ‘foo’: No such file or directory\nek@Ilex:~$ ln -s foo bar\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l foo bar\nls: cannot access foo: No such file or directory\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 ek ek 3 Oct  2 20:25 bar -> foo\nek@Ilex:~$ file bar\nbar: broken symbolic link to `foo'\n\nSince /bin/sh is the interpreter for many important scripts used to boot the system and perform other tasks, it needs to exist. Making it a broken link will render an Ubuntu system non-functioning.\nGetting zsh to Provide /bin/sh\nUbuntu is designed to use dash for sh, and is not developed or tested with zsh as sh in mind. Please don't attempt this on a system you need for critical tasks. This is strictly for education/fun, and should be done in a non-critical virtual machine or other non-critical system.2\n\n\n*\n\n*Install zsh ; by default in Ubuntu, it is not installed.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install zsh\n\n\n*Point sh at zsh instead of dash by running cd /bin; rm sh; ln -s /bin/zsh /bin/sh (as you did).\n\n*Verify sh is a good link to zsh by running file sh (or if you're no longer in /bin, use file /bin/sh).\nYou should see sh: symbolic link to `zsh' (or /bin/sh: symbolic link to `zsh').\n\n*Reboot and see if Ubuntu still works.\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*And apparently also, at least sometimes, from a text-based virtual console, also as explained in Termhn's answer. This worked for me one of the times I tested it2, but failed another time I tested it. And I know it did not work for you. (In contrast, the live CD method is very reliable.)\n\n*Testing for this answer was performed on a 64-bit Ubuntu Mate 14.10 Utopic Unicorn (beta) system running in a VirtualBox virtual machine. (Not because there's anything about that configuration that best models this problem, but just because that was the desktop Ubuntu system I had on hand for testing.) That something worked for me does not guarantee it will work for you, even on the same version of Ubuntu.\n\n*On Ubuntu, /bin/zsh is usually a symlink to /etc/alternatives/zsh which is usually a symlink to /bin/zsh5 (which is the actual Z Shell executable). But since both /bin and /etc are located on the root filesystem even when /usr is mounted over a network or otherwise on a separate volume, this is fine.\n\n", "Q: Install Broadcom driver I have a live USB of Ubuntu 11.04. I  trying to get the WiFi to work.\nThere seem to be two options. Install the driver in live USB mode, then have it gone after the required restart or install Ubuntu to the hard drive and have the computer try to download the WiFi driver from the internet (which will never work because I don't have WiFi).\nI have the driver currently installed in the live USB but can't use it until I restart, which deletes the driver...\nWhat should I do?\nNote:\nI am more interested in finding a way to activate the drivers that I just installed without restarting than finding what drivers to use (since these are almost certainly the correct drivers)\nThe card is BCM4311\nEdit:\nOK, the problem is solved but I still would like to know how someone is supposed to do this. Since the drivers were on the live USB there must be a way to get them off of there and use them on the fully installed version.

A blinking cursor is the only thing that appears.

I had problems with the Graphic Card in the past. I use an ACER T135-S97Z with AMD Sempron - 512MB RAM.\n\nA: Downgrade the kernel.\nThe kernel that came with 14.04.1 was 3.13.0-32-generic. The kernel that worked was 3.13.0-24-generic. It is available in the repositories.\nHow to get it?\nBoot from a LiveCD/flash drive and open a terminal.\nNow, we need to load ourselves into the computer's new, non-functional OS:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo chroot /mnt\nAfter the final command all commands you type are now executed as though you had actually booted up the computer. This is handy, because it means we can use:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nTo grab the latest packages and install them.\nWe can think downgrade the kernel with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.13.0-24-generic\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-3.13.0-24-generic\nWe can then be sure that GRUB is updated using:\nsudo update-grub\nIf initramfs complains about things, you may need to run:\nsudo update-initramfs\nAfter installing the kernel and updating grub, reboot.\nStart-up will probably fail again by showing a blank screen or one with a single blinking cursor in the upper left. Ctrl+Alt+Delete to restart a second time.\nNow, the GRUB menu will show.

Now I think I've managed to to turn my laptop (Asus Vivobook i5, SSD) into a paperweight by uninstalling Bumblebee (incorrectly?)\nI used this command to uninstall it: \nsudo apt-get remove bumblebee-nvidia\nAfter the reboot I only get a black screen. I can hear it get to the login screen but nothing happens. I can't get into the boot menu - tried F2, Del, Esc, F10 during startup and nothing happens. I've removed the harddrive and tried to boot of a USB with Ubuntu on it and all I get is a black screen. I never see the Asus Logo or any other indication on the screen - it's just black. \nMy feeling is that I have somehow broken the hybrid graphics card.\nDoes anyone know how to reset this ... or fix this somehow?\nElse I have to buy a new laptop.\n\nA: The problem is that you've uninstalled bumblebee without uninstalling the graphics driver. When you see the black screen, press CTRL + ALT + 1 (or F1 - try both) to bring up a console. Log in with your username and password. From here, uninstall your graphics driver (sudo apt-get remove nvidia-driver) or re-install bumblebee (sudo apt-get install bumblebee-nvidia). Afterwards, restart.\nThe black screen you're experiencing is because of the normal nvidia driver. See, everything in Linux happens through something called X. When you install nvidia-driver, it edits the config file for X (or you do) in order to avoid the black screen. But with optimus laptops, you need to pay around with it quite a bit more (aided only by Nvidia's own vague instructions). The only reason it's like this is because nvidia doesn't feel like doing anything about it.\nIt's no wonder Linux Torvalds cursed at NVIDIA.\n", "Q: How do i get permission to edit a file in /etc/?

All you have to do is update your chroot or crouton with the following command line within the chrome os terminal: sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -n  -u\n being the name of your chroot (precise, trusty, etc.). based on your error, your chroot name is \"precise\" so you'll input that as the following command line: sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -n precise -u\nif you get some kind of error then it's mainly because you more than likely deleted your crouton file. redownload that file here http://goo.gl/fd3zc if you did. then go back to the whole update crouton deal i just told you about. \n\nA: I recommend following my answer and removing ChromeOS completely.

I have 115 GB of free space and I'm not sure what to do now?\n\nA: You can increase the amount of shrinkable volume by trying the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Auslogics Disk Defrag (http://www.auslogics.com/en/software/disk-defrag/). It will give you critical information on why your volume's shrinkable size is limited. If you notice that the immovable files towards the end of your volume are not Master File Table files (MFTs) then you are in luck and can continue below.\n\n*Disable System Restore.\n\n*Disable the pagefile. Often, pagefile.sys is the unmovable file that prevents you from being able to further shrink your volume. You can do this by going to Advanced System Settings in Control Panel, click on Performance > Advanced > Change > No Paging File. In Windows 10, you must click on the \"Set\" button to make the changes take effect.\n\n*Disable Hibernation Mode by opening an elevated command prompt (i.e. right click command prompt and run as administrator) and typing \"powercfg -h off\"\n\n*Open disk cleanup and delete any unnecessary files.\nOnce you do this, restart your computer and launch the disk defragmenting tool you downloaded in step 1. Defragment your active Windows drive you wish to shrink. Restart your computer once again.\nNow, launch disk utilities and try resizing the partition again. Hopefully, you should be able to shrink your drive further. I was able to shave off over 100GB from my 250GB SSD after I followed these steps. In my case, it was the pagefile.sys that was preventing my PC from shrinking the volume at first.\nNote: once you have shrunk your volume to your liking, you can feel free to re-enable the items you might have had to disable earlier.\nGood luck!\nSource(s):\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/working-around-windows-vistas-shrink-volume-inadequacy-problems/\n", "Q: Focus RT an ERP software on Ubuntu I m using a mac and I would like to know if Ubuntu would help me run Focus RT on it.

I am the only one user.\n\nA: I think Ubuntu’s web app integration has changed in 14.04. When you create a web app for a service like Gmail, Facebook, Ubuntu will now use the same browser used on Ubuntu Mobile. This theoretically makes web apps more consistent between the desktop and mobile versions of Ubuntu, but it’s a problem if you actually want to use these apps. This browser doesn’t work anywhere near as well and doesn’t even have access to the Flash plug-in.\nIf you want launcher icons for your favorite web apps, you should probably skip Ubuntu’s native integration features.

Or applications?\n\nA: You should use LVM and a cloning cron script.\nI am going to assume this setup for you:\n\n*\n\n*4 drives for LVM and file storage.\n\n*External USB drive for backups. (at /dev/sdf1)\n\n*No duplication -- use dd to completely clone as necessary.\n\nLVM\n\nYou need to first set up LVM. This diagram is a good example:\n\nUse a hard drive, and assign each to a LVM folder such as /lvm or whatever. This article is very good for describing LVM. I recommend reading it for a better and more detailed LVM introduction.\nFirst off, partition all storage drives, but do not add a partition scheme! Use unallocated as the partition type. I will assume that your storage partitions are /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1, /dev/sdd1, and /dev/sde1. Your installation will be at /dev/sda1.\nNext, you need to make the drivers LVM-ready:\npvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1\n\nOnce that is done, you want to group those drives:\nvgcreate homeNAS /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1\n\nThis creates a group called \"homeNAS\" that conains all of the above drives.\nNext, create the Logical Volume:\nlvcreate --name share homeNAS\n\nCreate the filesystem:\nmkfs.ext3 /dev/homeNAS/share\n\nOnce this is done, run the following to create the lvm folder:\nmkdir /lvm/\n\nMount it using:\nmount /dev/homeNAS/share /lvm\n\nTo mount it on every boot, add the following to the end of your /etc/fstab. Make a backup!!\n/dev/homeNAS   /lvm     ext3       rw,noatime    0 0\n\nNote that the above guide for LVM is very basic, and is not meant for fancy things. Read the linked article for a much more detailed explanation.\nCron Script\n\nFirst off, get an external disc drive. It should be plenty big for storing all of your files. It should be able to hold 1.5x the size of your entire LVM partition (ie, 500GB HDD = 750GB backup).\nI will assume your drive has one partition (ext4 at /dev/sdf1, which is mounted at /media/backup)\nCreate a shell script named lvm-backup.sh in /etc/lvm-scripts/ like this:\ncp /lvm/folder1/ /media/backup/lvm/folder1\ncp /lvm/folder2/ /media/backup/lvm/folder2\ncp /lvm/folder3/ /media/backup/lvm/folder3\ncp /lvm/folder4/ /media/backup/lvm/folder4\n\nWhat this'll do is copy the specified folders to the backup drive. You should not clone directly, as that takes forever and can be detrimental to your system.\nQuickly run:\nchown root:root /etc/lvm-scripts/lvm-backup.sh\nchmod +x /etc/lvm-scripts/lvm-backup.sh\n\nTo run the backup nightly at midnight, add this to your /etc/crontab:\n00 00 * * * sh /etc/lvm-scripts/lvm-backup.sh\n\nIf you want more specific control of when to run the script, see this Howto on Cron.\n", "Q: cant transfer files from home to usb?

If it's shared between multiple people, however, either you all share the password for the whole-disk encryption, or you have separate keys that each unlock the whole-disk encryption.  \nIf you do have \"Home Directory\" encryption, it's not actually the case that your entire home directory is encrypted.  Rather, you have a directory ~/Private that you can store files (or symlink dot-files) in, backed by directory ~/.Private.  Someone who can become root on the system can see rough file sizes, last-modification times, and directory-tree depth within that directory.  Furthermore, if you use a program to edit one of those files, it's possible that unencryted sensitive material could be written to swap or temporary files.  \nTo \"delete the encryption\", just move files out of ~/Private with mv.\n", "Q: Localhost Configuration how to run php program, i have install Apache,mysql,phpmyadmin.I don't know to configure files and directories to run php project on local host.

How do you determine the combined width of the components in a Row {}? \nThe width of the row itself will not work, as I need to set its spacing:, and using this property will create a loop error. It is also an active property, so setting it with\nComponent.onCompleted{} \n\nwill also not suffice.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Why do you think it does not work?\nThe following snippet of code works correctly for me:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: root\n    width: units.gu(100)\n    height: units.gu(100)\n\n    Row {\n        id: row\n        spacing: 2\n        Rectangle { color: \"red\"; width: 50; height: 50 }\n        Rectangle { color: \"green\"; width: 20; height: 50 }\n        Rectangle { color: \"blue\"; width: 50; height: 20 }\n    }\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        console.log(row.width)\n    }\n}\n\nI see 124 displayed on the console (50+2+20+2+50). So the Row width gives you not only the width of each combined elements but also takes into account the spacing between them.\nIf you need the width of the combined elements without the spacing, you can use the following method:\nconsole.log(row.width - (row.children.length - 1)*row.spacing)\n\nUpdate:\nTo only get the width of the components within the row you need to iterate over all the children:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: root\n    width: units.gu(100)\n    height: units.gu(100)\n\n    Row {\n        id: row\n        spacing: 2\n        Rectangle { color: \"red\"; width: 50; height: 50 }\n        Rectangle { color: \"green\"; width: 20; height: 50 }\n        Rectangle { color: \"blue\"; width: 50; height: 20 }\n\n        property var children_width\n\n        Component.onCompleted: {\n            children_width = Qt.binding(function() { var i, w=0; for (i in children) {w += children[i].width}; return w });\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        console.log(row.children_width)\n    }\n}\n\nThe new children_width property value is 120.\n", "Q: How to triple boot Ubuntu 14.04 and freeBSD 10?

I'm using vmware and want to add space to a VM without shutting down the system by simply adding space to the existing drive.

In Linux, the norm is that all applications use the standard folders instead (/bin, or /usr/bin for executables, /lib, or /usr/lib for libraries, etc.). Since the standard binary folders are all in the default PATH, you usually don't need to add application-specific folders to the PATH  manually. \nHowever, if you install an application to a nonstandard location, then you'll need to add that location to the PATH manually.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout?\n", "Q: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open I been getting this problem in terminal now for a day.

After a cold boot, my laptop runs perfectly, but after resuming from suspend, the fan kicks in to 100% and blows out cold air, indicating that the fan isn't responding to the temperature of the laptop components. As proof, here's the output from sensors:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +41.0°C  (crit = +101.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +43.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 0:         +43.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 1:         +39.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\n\nMy laptop model is Sony SVE14A290X.

You can write a pm-action(8) resume hook that restarts the fancontrol service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file /etc/pm/sleep.d/10_fancontrol (e. g. with gksudo gedit):\n#!/bin/sh\ncase \"$1\" in\nresume)\n    exec service fancontrol restart;;\nesac\n\n\n*Mark it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/10_fancontrol\n\n\nA: On more recent Ubuntu using systemd, you need a similar script but in /lib/systemd/system-sleep:\n#!/bin/bash\ncase \"$1\" in\npost)\n  exec service fancontrol restart;;\nesac\n\n\nA: I followed the suggestion for systemd and it worked briefly.  It appears to me that it may work only on the first suspend/resume cycle after a cold boot.\nI tried restarting the fancontrol service manually but it was 'masked' and permission denied.  I tried unmasking it but that did not solve the problem.  \nFolks have speculated that this issue is a kernel regression.  Upon searching it is seen cropping up over the past ten years.

How can I make G++ link dynamically against GLIBC 2.11.1?\nIf there is, how do I go about getting GLIBC 2.11.1? Can I download it from Ubuntu's repository? Should I build it from source? Or should I install Ubuntu 10.04 (which contains my desired GLIBC version) and copy it to my Ubuntu 14.04?\nIf there isn't I guess I'll just have to use Ubuntu 10.04 and update G++ to 4.8.2. In that case, when I update from 4.4.3 (the default version in Ubuntu 10.04) to 4.8.2, will that update GLIBC too?\nPlease be as verbose as possible, and possibly give me some instructions.\nThanks in advance to anyone who replies!\nSolution:\nI tried using libc.so and ld-linux.so from Ubuntu 10.04 in Ubuntu 14.04, it linked to my version of ld-linux.so, but it kept using it's own version of libc.so.

I used Ubuntu a few years, but eventually switched to OS X, not fixing for almost five years puzzle of Firefox on Ubuntu. \nRegardless of whether you use the stable version, or test, scrolling the main page Facebook runs terribly slow. In Chrome and Chromium problem does not occur, but if it's my parents or friends, which I recommended system complain because they just prefer Firefox. Tell me what to do? \nNaturally, the problem occurs on powerful and very weak computers, without distinction, whether the system is 32 or 64 bit. Currently, I see the problem in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: It is likely that this is not because of system speed, but because of how Firefox is configured to handle scrolling.\nStart by typing about:config in the address bar. This will provide you with access to detailed Firefox settings.\nOnce there, search for scroll and you will find tons of values that address scrolling speed, animations, and behaviour.\nIf you are scrolling with mouse wheel, you may significantly increase scroll speed by increasing the value of mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount. This setting is the amount by which a page is scrolled when you turn your wheel for one tick.\nIf scrolling is slow when using the scrollbar, you may wish to disable smooth scrolling animation, which may be causing some slight lag. To achieve that, set general.smoothScroll to false.\nIt may be required to restart Firefox before these changes take effect.\n", "Q: How to set default to ruby 2.1.2? I have ruby 1.9.3 and 2.1.2. When I open the terminal by default it uses ruby 1.9.3 but I want to use ruby 2.1.2.\nHow can I set ruby 2.1.2 to be default?\n\nA: You should install RVM to manage your Ruby versions. \nTo install RVM do\nsudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev gawk libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison libffi-dev nodejs\n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\n\nIf that breaks for some reason then follow the instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/9056395/2376036\nThen to make the default 2.1.2 do\nrvm --default use 2.1.2\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 14.04 you can install ruby2.0 package. Currently the package offers version 2.0.0p384 (eventually the package might offer Ruby 2.1 or newer). This is the simples way how to install ruby binaries:\nsudo apt install ruby2.0\n\nThen you'll have binaries ruby2.0 and gem2.0. For replacing default ruby 1.9 by 2.0 you can do following (NOTE: you might break applications that strictly requires Ruby <= 1.9).\nsudo update-alternatives --set /usr/bin/ruby ruby /usr/bin/ruby2.0 10\nsudo update-alternatives --set /usr/bin/gem gem /usr/bin/gem2.0 10\n\nOther possibilities are using some ruby version manager like rbenv or RVM. The first one is more complicated to setup, but less hacky than RVM. Both allow install almost any version of Ruby you would like to use.\n\nA: If you’re using Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) or newer then you can add this PPA:\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you can install whichever package you want, for example\nsudo apt-get install ruby2.2\n\nTo be able to build native extensions you'll need to dev package too\nsudo apt-get install ruby2.2-dev\n\nTo easily switch between installed Ruby versions, install ruby switch:\nsudo apt-get install ruby-switch\n\nCommands of utiliy\nruby -v\nruby-switch --list\n\nExample\nsudo ruby-switch --set ruby2.1\n\nFrom:  https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/\n\nA: /usr/bin/ruby is usually a link to /etc/alternatives/ruby, which in turn links to the executable of the default ruby version (e. g. /usr/bin/ruby1.9). You can change the configured default version with:\nsudo update-alternatives --config ruby\n\nIf the desired version did not set up itself as alternative for ruby (e. g. if it isn't set up by the package manager), you can do it yourself with\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ruby ruby /path/to/ruby2.1 <PRIORITY>\n\nwhere <PRIORITY> is a positive integer. Then you can perform the first step.\nFor details see the manual of update-alternatives(8).\n", "Q: Network notification after installing kde-nm-connection-editor I have installed plasma-nm on my Ubuntu 14.04.

But These notification are still here and this is too annoying.\nAny help on how to stop these notifications with out affecting other ones.

When you log on there is an option to choose the desktop interface you'd like to use.

The process to get it working is just a bit convoluted.\nThe following steps have been verified to work on 14.04:\nAfter installing SNMP and its daemon(sudo apt-get install snmp snmpd), you will need to edit the file /etc/snmp/snmp.conf and comment out the line containing \"mibs:\"\nWithin this file, change the line:\nmibs :\n\nto\n#mibs : \n\nNext, assuming you haven't done this already, you will need to obtain the full set of IETF MIBs. These files do not ship, by default, on Debian/Ubuntu systems due to licensing issues. \nFrom the terminal(Ctrl-Alt-t), enter the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install snmp-mibs-downloader\nsudo download-mibs\nThen, you will need to modify /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.\n\n\n*\n\n*To allow SNMP the system to receive queries on interfaces other than its loopback address. The lines for this should look like this:\n#  Listen for connections from the local system only\n#  agentAddress  udp:127.0.0.1:161\n#  Listen for connections on all interfaces (both IPv4 *and* IPv6)\nagentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161\n\nNote that this will allow ANY system to query your machine. You will need to adjust this to limit SNMP access to your device.\n\n*You will now want to change your Read-only SNMP string from public to a custom string of your choosing, as below:\n#rocommunity public  default    -V systemonly\nrocommunity <My$ecret$tr1nG> (don't use this example!)\n\nNote: Removing -V systemonly from the line will allow access to the entire MIB tree and not restrict it to the system part of the tree.\n\n*Restart the SNMP daemon\nsudo service snmpd restart\n\nFinally, your SNMP query should now respond properly.\ne.g.:\nsnmpwalk -v 2c -c <My$ecret$tr1nG> <MachineName> ipadd\n\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntAddr.127.0.0.1 = IpAddress: 127.0.0.1\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntAddr.192.168.1.7 = IpAddress: 192.168.1.7\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntIfIndex.127.0.0.1 = INTEGER: 1\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntIfIndex.192.168.1.7 = INTEGER: 2\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntNetMask.127.0.0.1 = IpAddress: 255.0.0.0\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntNetMask.192.168.1.7 = IpAddress: 255.255.255.0\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntBcastAddr.127.0.0.1 = INTEGER: 0\nIP-MIB::ipAdEntBcastAddr.192.168.1.7 = INTEGER: 1\n\nSee the following answers for additional reference:\nHow to get or configure IP-MIB in Ubuntu 12.04?\nWhat is SNMP?\n\nA: I would start with a stock config with a view to .1, enable debug logging, and try get queries to OIDs.  I honestly never got the hang of MIBs, and since I only used SNMP for stuff like MRTG and cacti, I never really needed to know more.  See if you can get the simplest config possible working, then add one element at a time while tailing the pertinent log file(s).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 can't mount exFAT external hard disk I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 lately and tried to read files from an external drive that was formatted to exFAT from NTFS.

I am hot plugging two hard drives into 5 SATA controllers. And each time I see them as /dev/sda and /dev/sdc.\nWhy?\nHow will I configure RAID host swap if drives can change names depending on plug order?\nUPDATE\nHere http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-creating-software-raid-one-arrays/ it is said, that to create RAID, one should issue a command like \nmdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\n\nand in config file /etc/mdadm.conf one should write \nARRAY /dev/md0 devices=/dev/sdc1,/dev/sdd1 level=1 num-devices=2 auto=yes\n\nSuppose one of drives was fail, say /dev/sdc1, I unplug it and then plugged back and it become /dev/sdd1. Configuration will become wrong.\nSo, no any RAID can fulfill it's purpose if drives referred to by logical names, right? And ergo all RAID examples over the Net are just wrong, right?\n\nA: To your second question: \nEach storage drive has an UUID\n(Wikipedia Link) which stays the same until you change the partition (like changing filesystem, etc.).

I have installed two packages (xrdp and ubuntu-desktop) on my server release and it cause isntallation of numerous packages by dependencies, including even sphinx speech recognition. If I would know these two packages are so heavy, I would not install them.\nWhat can I do now?\nHow to revert all installations done last hour? Is it possible?\n\nA: Assuming neither xrdp nor ubuntu-desktop was actually installed before, you can remove them and all the packages that were automatically installed to satisfy their dependencies:\nsudo apt-get purge xrdp ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nOr in one step:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove xrdp ubuntu-desktop\n\nHere's an example of what that looks like.\nThis does not select by date and time, but I suspect that's not really necessary (or helpful) toward solving this particular problem. The packages you don't want were installed because they were needed for  xrdp and ubuntu-desktop. (Probably mostly for ubuntu-desktop, which is a metapackage whose purpose is to cause lots of stuff to be installed.)\nSo removing them and autoremoving their automatically installed dependencies is probably the most correct and elegant solution.\n(Just running sudo apt-get purge on the two manually installed packages would not automatically cause the dependencies to be removed. The only difference between the remove and purge actions is that purge deletes systemwide configuration files of the packages it removes.)\n\nA: You can use\nsudo apt-get purge xrdp ubuntu-desktop\n\nWhich will remove those packages and all the dependencies that they installed, though be careful with purging ubuntu-desktop, not sure why you would want to do that...\n", "Q: Can't print in portrait Since this morning, I can't print in full size portrait.

If it happens, you will needed to repair it using Boot-Repair\nAs you want to free some space from /dev/sda2/ and want to add it to  /dev/sda7 and your Ubuntu partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the live mode using Ubuntu CD or USB.\n\n*OPen Gparted Partition Editor.\n\n*Now right click on /dev/sda2 and select resize. Make some free space in the left side of /dev/sda2\n\n*Now right click on /dev/sda3, select resize and drag the box according to your need. Leave some space in the left side of /dev/sda3, which you will add to your / i.e /dev/sda7.\n\n\nNote one thing that you have made some space free in your primary partitition, which you want to add in your extended partition i.e /dev/sda7 (/).\n\n\n*\n\n*So drag the box of your extended partition, and take the free space(after /dev/sda3) inside it.\n\n*Once free space is inside extended partition box, repeat the above procedure to add it to add this free space to your /dev/sda7\n\n*Once you are setishfied with your partition scheme, apply it.\n", "Q: Terminal errors on terminal startup Whenever I start the Terminal, I get two errors at the top that say -bash: export:, then a path string, and then : not a valid identifier.  I know that these errors are being thrown because of an equal sign (=) in the path for some reason.  My question is: what file is running these export commands?  Is there any way to see what files are running when the terminal starts?\nBy the way: the path string in the error is old, it is one I used to have before it was changed.  I updated the /etc/environment/ file to what it is now, so I think I may have ran something that changed a startup file, and then when I uninstalled it, it left the export.\n\nA: Sounds like the problem might just be in the modified /etc/environment file; since you said you modified this, why didn't you post the contents?\nMost likely, it is something fairly simple, like a space or spaces around the equals sign.  If you put something like export foo = bar instead of export foo=bar, then the shell will attempt to export 3 variables:  \"foo\", \"=\", and \"bar\".\nWhy are you modifying that file?  Normally, you should modify $HOME/.bash_profile unless you have multiple users who need the same path.  If you are administering a system for multiple users, then you need to be more careful in making changes.\nAlso, you should be more careful about posting quoted error messages; you misspelled \"identifier\".  It's better to actually cut and paste errors to get them exact.\n", "Q: How can I ensure simple way RAID 1 is working?

To do things this way your file should read:\n30 22 * * *  root  apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y\n\n\n*Files in /etc/cron.daily/ are acually supposed to be standalone scripts, not cron-formatted strings. To do things this way, your file should read:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade -y\n\n\n*And perhaps most importantly... if you want to automate updates, I'd suggest something like apticron.

Earlier on windows, wifi used to work properly but recently when I switched to ubuntu 14.04 it does not connect to any network even though list of available networks is shown. I tried many answers posted on this site for similar problem but nothing worked.

I am running 14.04LTS and it appears from your output that the hardware is seen by Ubuntu. What I had found on my network was that any security regime using MAC addresses didn't really work and I suspect that my mac address isn't transmitted to the router. I need to look into this further when I have more time.\nI was using mac address filtering on top of the other security. \nAfter being lead into thinking that it was the driver etc and OEM support issues, I tackled the problem by removing all the security (see note below) and trying to connect. Fortunately it did, and so went about securing the network in a more compatible way.\nPlease note that my method was a calculated risk. My internet modem still had its' firewall in place, my lap top doesn't have any file sharing, and my router (admin) is password protected but remember that your router can be accessed at that time.\nI suspect that the problems I encountered was using a relatively old router, and as mentioned, the transmission of mac addresses.\nI hope this helps you navigate a solution.\nregards\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted /opt, how do I create it again? I am new to Ubuntu, today I was learning how to delete files and folders but accidentally I deleted the /opt directory that located in Computer.\nI don’t know if what I deleted is important or not. So I want to create the /opt directory again. where all other important folder exists and they are /var,/root, /home and so on.\n\nA: On a newly installed Ubuntu system, /opt exists but is empty. You can just run:\nsudo mkdir /opt\n\nAnd that will recreate it, with the correct permissions.\nBut if there was software installed inside when it was removed, that won't bring it back.\nThere probably wasn't, though. You'd likely have remembered installing it there. /opt is not usually for programs installed automatically through Ubuntu's package manager. Instead, for the most part it's used for programs that install with their own methods, often (but not only) proprietary payware installed from CD.\nIf you remember how you deleted /opt, a more specific prediction as to whether or not there was anything in it could be given. For example, if the way you remove it was to run sudo rmdir /opt, that will only work if the directory is empty. On the other hand, if you used rm -r, it needn't have been empty.\n\nA: First of all, check what files may have been deleted with dpkg -S /opt or grep ^/opt /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list. It should give you a list of packages that might need to be reinstalled. If none is, then just recreate the directory with a simple sudo mkdir /opt. You may also check if you have installed packages manually in those directories, but that's very tricky.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14 lubuntu terminal transparency does not work I have tried other related question on lubuntu desktop, on Ubuntu 14, on my Lenovo Laptop Z50. But the screen is not transparent.\n\nA: I found here a way of making windows transparent in Lubuntu. Just a CTRL + C - CTRL + V to grant the material isn't going to be lost so soon:\nsudo apt-get install xcompmgr transset\n\nHere it complained about not finding the transset. So I tried installing just the xcompmgr and everything worked fine.\nTo get xcompmgr running every time:\nleafpad ~/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart\n\nand add the line:\n@xcompmgr -c\n\nwhich turns on translucency and soft shadows. Fading can be added with -fD A where A is milliseconds between steps in a fade.\nTo control the level of opacity, make sure the program you want to change is running, then use:\ntransset B\n\nwhere B is some number between 0 and 1 where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. It'll turn your cursor into Then click on the window you want to change the transparency on. If you like fading, you may want to add -F to xcompmgr to allow for faded transitions when changing opacity. \n\nA: Yeah, it seems like this is a problem with Ubuntu in general and is beyond the scope of AskUbuntu that terminal transparency doesn't work. If you've gotta have it, it is worth installing Terminator which is a more advanced terminal emulator that supports transparency as well as a wealth of other features that you may or may not want to use.\n", "Q: Enabling beep in Ubuntu12.04 A duplicate of Enable System Beep in Ubuntu. Nothing mentioned there worked.\nI'm trying to enable beep in my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop and Ubuntu 14.04 desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*cout << \"\\a\" in g++\n\n*echo -e \"\\a\" in bash\n\n\nI want the above two to produce a beep.\nI followed this and searched it at other places, but nothing works. I have commented out blacklist pcspkr in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. I have also enabled it in alsamixer.\n> sudo apt-get install beep\n> beep    // produces beep\n> sudo modprobe pcspkr    // shows nothing\n> lsmod | grep pcspkr \npcspkr                 12631  0 \n> sudo grep pcspkr /var/log/dmesg \n[   16.278105] input: PC Speaker as /devices/platform/pcspkr/input/input8\n> pactl upload-sample /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/bell.ogg bell.ogg\n> pactl list samples     // shows bell.ogg\n\nBut how do I make it beep using \\a (esp in g++)?\n\nA: Many sound cards have a \"beep\" channel, often muted:\nrun \"alsamixer\" in a terminal : you may need to press F6 and select your card. scroll to the Beep channel using the arrow keys and press M to unmute the channel. notice that the \"MM\" label below the channel will change to \"00\". you can also use ↑ to increase the volume of the channel.\npress Esc to close alsamixer. \n(From archwiki: beep)\n"]
