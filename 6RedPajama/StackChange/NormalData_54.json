["Q: Can i upgrade my mid 2012 macbook pro to use DDR4 ram ? Can i upgrade my mid 2012 macbook pro to use DDR4 ram ? Checking Apple > About this Mac > Memory i got the following\nYour Mac contains 2 memory slots, each of which accepts\na 1600 MHz DDR3 memory module.\n\nWhich seems to suggest not, but i wondered if DDR4 was even around at the time my mac was made, is Ram a backwards compatible upgrade like placing a Sata SSD in a 10 year old device ? \n\nA: No, the Mid-2012 MacBook Pro is in no way upgradable to DDR4 RAM.\nTo use DDR4 RAM a lot of things must be compatible with DDR4 - one of those is the CPU itself. The Intel CPU in the mid-2012 MacBook Pro does not support DDR4 RAM.\nAnd no, DDR4 was not around in mid-2012. It was released to the market in 2014.\n", "Q: Is this safe to download and use Gutenprint driver for Mac from their site? Good day everyone!\nI am in a bit of a conundrum.\nOn one hand, I heard following site is good to download Gutenprint software:\ngimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_Download.php\nOn other hand, I also heard sourceforge site is bundled with malicious software.\nSo, is that place safe? Their download links are also in sourceforge.net.\nIs Gutenprint safe to use and is it safe to use the linked site?\n\nA: I'll answer very simply, if you want to know if something is safe or not, go on Virus Total and copy paste the link of the download file. But, if you download a software from their official website and you trust this company, just download it, it should be fine\n", "Q: Getting Audio and scores out of Jammit I've been using the Jammit app for learning songs and it's now not supported as the company that made it has gone bust. I've got a lot of tracks I've brought from them and they're still on my hard drive.....\nI found a site https://github.com/mtolly/jammittools and it seems to have a solution which would do everything I need it to (extract the audio and score files for me to use outside of the app) but I have come up against a problem! I just don't understand how to use the software! As it's not for distribution to others but solely for my use, I'm just after getting the things back that I've paid for but can no longer access.....\nI'm running an iMac 21.5 inch, Mid 2010, macOS Sierra v. 10.12.1\nI've managed to get so that some of the command lines work, but I cannot locate the files within the Jammit app.......\n\nA: I've developed a fairly decent Macintosh tool to extract all the separate CD quality audio (WAV, AIFF, or MP3 formats), printable PDF files of all the scores and tabs, animated video synced to the music.  \nThere is also  a player/mixer that lets you play along to the scrolling music, mute or adjust volume of individual tracks, slow to half speed, and loop sections.  It even supports Airplay so you can beam it your big screen tv and sound system.   \nWe have a growing database of free downloadable content that members have shared.  If you have Jammit tracks and want to be able to use them in any Mac or Windows DAW, and hopefully share some of your files, you are invited to check out our page at https://www.facebook.com/groups/125340751305319/?ref=bookmarks\nOr visit Crammit for Mac:  www.jammit.ca\n\nA: Here is a video on how to do it manually, I couldn't work out how to use jammittools either.  (You would need to find out the path for the songs, it is different to the executable path)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Spxnnqdks\n\nA: If you only require playing the files, you can use an open-source replacement of Jammit:\nhttp://unjammit.com\n", "Q: Mac OS X: Backing up my Mac So my aunt wants me to update her Mac OS X (10.5.8), and while I have the DVD for the next update, she also wants her files backed up because they are important to her (pictures and what not).\nI'm not entirely sure about what I should back up on, as she has this harddrive cd thing (like the picture) and it comes up as a dvd that can be burned.\nI don't know if it's okay to burn the disk with a back up or if it's even possible. I don't know if my aunt has anything on the disk but if she does, I would want those files untouched but I still want to put the back up on it.\nIs it possible to back up on this disk and keep the data on there okay or would it erase over it all? Do I need to get another hardrive to back it up on? And if so, what kind? \n\n\nA: The device in the photo is called a USB SuperDrive. It is a CD/DVD reader made by Apple. I wouldn't recommend making a backup on CD or DVD discs. But you'll use the SuperDrive to run the update on the update disc you have. Do not overwrite that update disc or make any changes to it, or it will become unusable.\nI recommend using a USB external hard drive to back up your aunt's files. You can buy an external hard drive at Apple, Amazon or any computer store. 1TB is the standard amount of storage these days, and it is unlikely that your aunt has more than that to be backed up.\nFinally, I highly recommend using Time Machine (an application that is already installed on your aunt's Mac) for backing up. It backs up the whole system (photos, music, applications, documents, everything), and it is the safest proprietary backup method. I recommend doing this before attempting an update. \nYou can use an external hard drive with Time Machine to backup the system. When you plug in an external hard drive for the first time, the Mac usually asks if you want to use it with Time Machine.\nIf your aunt really doesn't care about anything other than a few files, you can back them up to a free service like Dropbox designed to hold small amounts of data. Just be aware that if something goes wrong during the update, you risk losing everything that isn't backed up.\nShort of this, Apple has really excellent technical support, and while I can't make promises for them I've found that they're more than willing to explain these concepts in more depth. (They just can't perform a backup for you.)\n", "Q: How can I call Don Melton's transcode_video script from a shell script? I'm trying to create a Folder Action to transcode videos using Don Melton's scripts.\nWhen I run the script, transcode_video complains that HandBrakeCLI is not available, but when I run the command directly from the terminal it runs fine.\n\nI'm guessing this is some kind of bash script security thing, but I'm an amateur at this game. Is there a way round this? I've had to revert to calling HandBrakeCLI directly, which is not as easy to optimise.\n\nA: Two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fix your path. This is as simple as adding the following as your first line. I installed the scripts through gem, not git, so transcode_video is in /usr/local/bin - you'll need to set it as appropriate.\n\n\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\n\n*Make sure you cd into the directory you want to save the files into, as a step too. Otherwise, writes them out into $HOME, which appears to be the default working directory for automator bash scripts.\n\n\nMy total working code:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    echo $f > /tmp/filename.txt\n    cd ~/Desktop/SAmple/\n    transcode-video --mp4 -v \"$f\" > /tmp/transcode.out\ndone\n\n", "Q: Fix localhost cant provide a secure connection I accidently configured  a web-app to force a secure connection i.e. https, and although I have turned this off, I cannot get chrome to forget this error, so whenever I ask for the url of my local development server;\n http://localhost:3000/\n\nChrome instead returns\nhttps://localhost:3000/\n\nand gives the error\nThis site can’t provide a secure connection\n\nI have tried Chrome/Clear Browsing data and this does not help.  The app uses ruby on rails and the secure connection was done by setting   config.force_ssl = true.\nHow do I fix this? \n\nA: For me the solution was to use http rather than https\n\nA: As this is only your development site on localhost, and not a real domain name, you can solve the problem in Chrome by opening the following URL:\nchrome://net-internals/#hsts\n\nYou must open this URL in Chrome.\nFrom there you get the settings for HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). Then under \"Delete domain\" put in localhost and delete it from the list.\nIf you have used other local names than localhost to refer to your development setup, delete those as well.\n\nA: I always find adding a fake query string after the URL refreshes the cache for me.\ne.g. http://localhost:3000/?fake=true\n\nA: I ended up going for the nuclear option, uninstalling chrome and using this post to delete all my google-chrome data. It worked. Note that just uninstalling chrome did not work.\n", "Q: Cannot add gmail account on iOS I am trying to add a gmail account to my iPad in order to have contacts, email, and calendar sync.  I go to Settings -> Mail -> Accounts -> Add Account and enter my gmail credentials.  It accepts the credentials and then goes to this screen:\n\nThe spinner to the left of Gmail will spin for about 20 seconds then it just takes me back to this screen:\n\nThe account never gets added.  I get an email on my phone that says \"new sign in from iPad\" so I know the authentication is working.\nI am using iOS 10.2. \nThe same problem existed in 10.0.2.\nSome users have reported that doing this process over 4g rather than WiFi works, but this is a WiFi only device.\nThe gmail app is installed and logs me in just fine.\nThe same thing happens on both my 2 factor authentication account and my account without 2FA.\n\nA: I had this problem too.\nWhen I checked on google if there was a security issue (https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity) I noticed that my iphone location was overseas.\nI then realised that iPhone was connected to my company wifi and was routed via their overseas hub.\nSo I disabled the wifi so that only the local mobile data was being used. \nAfter that the add mail > google then worked.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro (2010) doesn't charge My MacBook Pro (2010) doesn't want to charge when I plug my MagSafe into it. This is what I get:\n\nI already looked at Apple's support page, but it still doesn't work at all.\nHow can I make my computer charge again?\n\nA: I know there's a question mark over your charger, so it's understandable you may not have tried this, but it's still worth at least trying an SMC reset. \nTo do this on your MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (or power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nIf nothing happens, you could use the MagSafe lead and connect it to one of the newer MagSafe 2 adapters you have (keeping the lead but changing the power source) and then trying the SMC reset again.\nLet us know how you go.\n[EDIT]\nOk, your MBP 2010 has a 60W Power Adapter and so does the MBP 2013. \nIf you can borrow that (the MBP 2013 adapter), then connect your MagSafe lead to that and connect it to your MBP 2010 for a while and leave it. Take note of whether the power/charge light comes on or not. \nRegardless, leave it connected for at least a half hour and then try starting your computer. If it boots okay, then check the battery status (in the menu bar) to see how much charge it has and whether there's any sort of error message. If there is, take a note of the message. Then shut down your computer and leave it connected to power for a while (if possible, long enough for what a usual charge would take).\nFinally, before having to return the adapter, redo my steps for resetting the SMC.\nOnce you've done all this, report back on how this all went (any power light, any charge, any error message, etc).\n", "Q: How do I know if my iPad has a virus I was watching a video on an app and a pop up message shows up saying that my iPad has a malware or something I'm really confused what do I do and how do I know that my device has a virus or not?\n\nA: If your iPad has not been jailbroken, then it is extremely unlikely that it has malware on it, as it would have required that you explicitly installed the malware yourself.\nAll programs under iOS run in a sandbox, and are unable to affect each other. This is not always the case once the device has been jailbroken, and is one of the key reasons not to jailbreak an iOS device unless you know what you are doing.\nWebpages that say \"your computer has a virus! Give us some money and we will make it go away\" are just trying to get money out of you. Ignore.\n\nA: No. \nThis is a duplicate question. \nYes, you can get malware on an iPad if you install apps from untrusted sources (Anything outside of the App Store).\nHowever, you cannot get a virus from simply going to a website, as the process of installing an app from a third-party requires your interaction and can't be done in the background.\n", "Q: Deleting a Mac Partition on a drive that has bootcamp? I have the following setup and am looking for a solution to delete a partition on the drive that has bootcamp. Below is my system setup - \nPrimary SSD: Contains mac OS Sierra. Bootable - I boot from this drive.\nSecondary SSD (in place of Optical Drive): Windows 7 Bootable (100GB) + Empty Mac Partition (130 GB) + Another Empty Mac Partition (26 GB).\nI would like to delete the partition that has 26GB and 1) merge it with my Windows 7 Partition OR 2) merge it with my 130GB Partition.\nI have tried to merge it with my Windows 7 Partition which is when i created the 26GB partition using Disk Utility. I realized that made my Windows 7 partition unbootable before i could merge the 26GB GB to it. I was able to recover it by recreating the MBR, but now the 26GB partition still remains. Does anybody have any ideas as to how to add this to windows partition? Or if that involves reinstalling windows i could just let go all the hassle and add it back to my 130 GB partition. Either solution works for me. The key thing is I don't want to corrupt my boot config again. \nAny advise would be much appreciated.\n\nA: From within OSX you should be able to delete both the empty mac partitions, then create a new one, all using Disk Utility.\nHere's a good guide: https://www.lifewire.com/resize-mac-disk-utility-volume-os-x-el-capital-later-3573395\nGiven that both partitions are empty there's no risk of data loss here. Just wipe them both out and create one large one.\n", "Q: How do I forward iMessages from my computer to my Android phone? Last week, I had an iPhone 4s, an iPad mini, and a Macbook Pro. My cell phone plan was connected to my iPhone, and I set up text forwarding so that text messages from my phone would also load on my iPad and my Macbook Pro.\nThree days ago, I lost my iPhone. To fill the gaping hole in my life, I swapped my cell phone plan to work with my dad's old Samsung Galaxy S2.\nNow I can send texts from my phone, and iMessages from my iPad and laptop.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get iMessage to forward messages as texts to my Galaxy S2?\n\n*Is it possible to get my iPad and my laptop to synchronize with texts sent from my Galaxy S2?\nAll I want is to have my iMessages and my texts in the same place.\n\nA: There are a number of third party solutions to this problem which the first party (Apple) has never resolved. Most of them involve forwarding your messages to a server somewhere, where they'll use a cell phone gateway to forward them as SMS to a phone you choose. Obviously, this represents a significant security vulnerability, as whoever owns the server has full access to your messages which could contain sensitive information. \nThe only way around this vulnerability is to own the server yourself, which is basically what PieMessage does. It's an open source project hosted on Github, also available on the App Store somewhere. I haven't actually tried it out yet -- I don't have an iMac that stays at home all day to use as the server -- but it seems to have trusted reviews.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra ALL features page In previous releases Apple had an \"All Features\" or \"New Enhancements\" page buried somewhere off the main Mac OS X page.

Pinging it gives no result either.\nThe default configuration for IP was \"using DHCP\",so I tried giving the MacBook Air a manual ip address (192.168.1.124, either with \"DHCP with manual address\" or \"Manually\") which makes it stop complaining about the ip address being in use, but it still cannot connect to the wifi.

Start the Wireless Diagnostics (option select the wireless icon in the menu bar) and work through the steps.\n\n*Once you're convinced the wireless connection is OK - then focus on the IP address / router / netmask with the goal of making the internet reachable. You might need to log in to the router as well as the wireless base station to determine correct / exact values of net mask, router and IP. Hard code those while you are testing to reduce another device spoofing your IP or squatting on your DHCP reservation as indicated by \"another device is using your IP address\" message. That basically means your network can't work reliably. If you need help there - use the Network Diagnostics (use spotlight to find and run it)\n\n\nBasically - you don't need IP to connect to WiFi and if you're messing with IP when the WiFi isn't connected, you're chasing ghosts and not focusing on the narrow issue of the physical link in the network. For that, you might need to go within 5 feet of the device and both should get powered off for several minutes if you suspect the hardware radios are failing. \n", "Q: Can I use a security key such as YubiKey to sign into Google on Safari?

Of course I have backups!\n\nA: The short answer to this is YES.\nI have done this exact thing in my iMac and it works perfectly.  You don't have to \"uninstall\" the Fusion drive.

Are there any reasons not to use a 10w ipad charger with a USB->USB-C cable to charge a new MacBook Pro 2016? Have the one charger that came with MacBook but would like to be able to plug in at office, home on road, etc. with other chargers. Thx.\n\nA: A 10 watt iPad charger will not charge a MacBook Pro because the MacBook Pro will only charge from a USB power supply that supports \"USB Power Delivery\" or USB-PD.  Apple's website states as such.  Even then there may be other conditions that need to be met, such as voltage and current supplied.\nNo USB power brick under 18 watts, at least none that I am aware of, supports USB-PD.  A USB power brick that doesn't support USB-PD might supply power, which will slow the discharge from the battery, but it will not add charge to the battery.  Connecting a 12 watt USB power brick to my MacBook Pro will show in System Information as supplying power (at least that's what it looks like to me) but it does not show as charging the battery.\nDuring a power outage I was able to run my MacBook Pro from a 27 watt USB-C charger that was plugged into a portable power pack.  With some rather lightweight web surfing I didn't see the MacBook battery run down.  This same 27 watt charger was able to charge the battery while the laptop (and I) slept.\nOfficially that's the story, that a MacBook will only charge from a USB-PD power supply.  Unofficially, I have read that people have had mixed results using non-USB-PD chargers to charge MacBooks. Personally I have not been curious or desperate enough to run this experiment myself.  My guess is that for this to work the laptop would have to be using less power than the power supply so that there is enough power left over to put in the battery.  That means the laptop would likely have to be powered off or asleep.\nIf you are looking for a travel charger for your MacBook Pro then I'd suggest getting nothing smaller than 27 watts.  Anything smaller is unlikely to charge the battery, and if it does it will charge quite slowly.\n\nA: A 10W iPad charger should in theory work and you would be correct that it would be a slow charge.   Well, to be accurate, it would be a horribly slow charge - you are getting a charger that is 1/6th (17%) of what is required (61W).\nWill there be a problem?  No.\nWill it charge?  Slowly.  Molasses in January slowly. From Apple's web site:\n\nYour Mac will charge from USB-C power adapters not manufactured by\n  Apple if they adhere to the USB Power Delivery specification.\n\nAssuming you are using a genuine Apple iPad charger, it should charge since Apple charges adhere to the spec.\n", "Q: Is it possible to play Podcasts through the headphones connected to an Apple Watch?

It is absolutely ludicrous that this is what you have to do to enable Search History on an iPhone (you would think that Google would make it easier to voluntarily give them your data).

I suspect it's because I restored from a backup and some local data got out of sync from google server, so I reset the phone using DFU mode and reinstalled everything from scratch. It worked immediately. It's a painful process, but Timeline feature is important enough for me to go through it.\n", "Q: Apple Approval for Keychain After update on my iPhone 7, I was prompted to set up some sort of approval where I needed to approve my phone from another device. When I went to my second device it asked to verify from another device also. I go to my third and last device to approve both the iPhone and the iPad from my MacBook and it says my MacBook needs to be approved too!? How am i supposed to approve all my devices if they all need approved? \n\nA: Apple has many security features within their iCloud Keychain. According to this support article, you do have some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use your iCloud security code that you set up when you started using iCloud Keychain. If you enter it too many times incorrectly, you will have to contact Apple support to try again. Too many incorrect tries will delete your security code from Apple's servers.\n\n*You can also verify your identity with a text message sent to the number used when first setting up iCloud Keychain. If you no longer have access to this number, you can also contact Apple support for more help.\nHope you can get this sorted out!\n", "Q: Which keyboard layout is this? \nWhich keyboard layout is this?

Is it okay to uninstall apps that came with my Mac like iMovie and GarageBand? I don't think I'll be using GarageBand so I'm planning to uninstall it. \nAdditionally, if there would be a time I may need it, is it possible to reinstall the app?\nThanks.\n\nA: iMovie and GarageBand are not necessary to the system and you may delete them at will. However, note that many other apps that come preinstalled on macOS are important to the system (even if it doesn't seem like it) and should not be deleted. As Steve Chambers commented below, though, macOS won't let you delete anything that falls into this category, assuming you aren't doing anything to get around that.\nIf your Mac was purchased after October 1, 2013, you can re-download the iLife and iWork apps (pictured below) for free at any time from the Mac App Store. Also, regardless of that, if you see them in the Purchased tab of the Mac App Store, that means you do have a “license” for them and can download them at any time.\n\n", "Q: Internal, virtual drive and recover HD missing. Unable to boot windows. How do I fix this? I was testing out a Linux Mint installation on an iMac in order to run some programs written for Linux. This iMac was a dual boot with Windows installed through bootcamp.

CoreStorage itself is a logical volume manager similar to Linux' LVM. An LVM is an additional abstraction layer in between hard disks and partitions on one side and volumes on the other side.\nIn macOS you can convert a partition (e.g disk0s2) with a HFS+ file system lossless to a Logical Volume Group which initially contains several nested items: a Physical Volume, a Logical Volume Family and a Logical Volume. The final Logical Volume is slightly smaller than the original partition, because CoreStorage needs some space to save administrative data.\nThe Logical Volume contains the data of the previous standard volume/partition and is mapped to its own (virtual) disk device: disk0s2 > disk1\nIf your Logical Volume disk1 contains a lot of free space you may resize it and add a second Logical Volume in the same Physical Volume and after formatting it you will get a second virtual device: disk0s2 > disk2\nIf you have a second physical partition on your main disk or a second disk with a partition you may add either or all of them to the first Logical Volume Group. They will be added to the total space available in the Logical Volume Group. You may also create a second Logical Volume Group.\nIf you have added a second partition (= Physical Volume) to the LVG you can expand the initial Logical Volume to span both Physical Volumes. If the second partition is on a different disk (SSD) this is called a \"Fusion Drive\". If the second Physical Volume is on the same drive it's a fake Fusion Drive. If you additionally add a partition on a third drive it's a Uber Fusion Drive.\nDepending on how you created the LVG you can revert a 1(LVG):1(PV):1(LVF):1(LV) to a normal volume. This is not possible with an e.g. 1:2:1:1 or 1:2:1:2 LVG because you can't map 1(LV)→ 2(HFS+-volumes) (~technically-mathematically).\nAnother feature of CoreStorage is volume encryption > FileVault2.\n\n*The \"missing internal, virtual drive\" doesn't need fixing because it's not missing but was converted to a normal partition/HFS+ volume again (see 1.)\nThe Recovery HD partition probably got deleted while installing Mint.\n\n*The main problem of your partition table is the MBR and its restrictions (four entries). Your Windows partition resides on the sixth partition which is actually not included in the MBR. You may fix this by following one of the many of David Anderson's answers related to MBR/PMBR/multi boot.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to share two internet connections simultaneously? The Sharing pane of System Preferences allows one internet connection from one interface to be shared to one other interface, e.g., share your connection from Ethernet 1 to computers using Wi-Fi.\nIs there a way outside of the Sharing GUI to simultaneously share two different internet connections out to two other interfaces (e.g., if A,B,C,D are interfaces: share A to B, and C to D).\n\nA: No - this will be hard on two levels.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your default routes and network routing would be quite involved to set up the correct paths for the Mac OS to route traffic along the paths you defined as opposed to the route each network would prefer.\n\n*The graphical interface has no design / affordance to set up more than one route (currently)\n\n\nThe closest way I could see to accomplish this would be to run a second Mac OS virtually and move C and D to the virtual machine with networking set up in bridge mode. That way you would be close to just having a pair of OS with a pair of forwards in place - one per OS.\n", "Q: How to force iMessage on iPhone to download messages stuck on Apple's servers?

I have tried logging out of iMessage. Turning iMessage off. restarting by holding down home and power. waiting ten minutes and reconnecting. \nCan't make it budge. I have had an ongoing conversation since then.\n\nA: I have no solid reference to back this up, but I have seen it empirically many times over many years & devices.\nOnce a message has been received & read by your account, no matter what device, other devices will no longer receive that message.  \nThere may be a timeout period - as you can clearly see when you have your phone & Mac next to each other, receiving at the same time. The one that last 'spoke' will be the one on which an incoming message will actually 'ping' & the other will wait about a minute before also pinging...  \n...But if one is off [& this is the bit about which I have no real information ... how long it needs to have been off & remain off], & the message is received & read on the other, then the first will never receive the message at all.\nThe same can be seen if your phone is outside reception range & a message is received on the Mac [at home].

These have all been stored on a massive NAS, and served from a Mac Mini with iTunes Home Sharing enabled.  \nUntil just a few days ago, our iPhones and our children's iPads could easily browse and play any previous purchases.  This was great, because well, when nothing new and interesting is available or when guests visit, we can quickly and easily re-play old shows and movies that we purchased without consuming any internet bandwidth.  \nWe allowed both iPhones and our newest iPad to update.  Apple removed the Video app and replaced it with the TV.app.  The TV app sucks.  Not only does it hang and crash often, it lists about 20 of our 4000+ shows and 10 of over 300+ movies that we purchased.   \nOur old iPad that has not updated yet still has the Video app installed.  It can still access Home Sharing, and thus it still lists and plays any of our purchases instantly.\nSo, is it possible to copy the old Video app from the old iPad somehow, and then copy that app over to our iPhones and the new iPad?\nI really get the impression from what is happening with \"TV apps\" and \"subscription\" terminology that Apple is trying to force people to become subscribers to an old-school, cable-like service tv-networks' bundling apps (shwew, that's a mouthful and yes it stinks of expensive cable TV).  So thoughtlessly breaking access to our own purchases, stored on our own networked devices further re-enforces this impression.  I've doubts that it was a total blunder that the new TV app is no longer listing Videos on our NAS, and only allows re-streaming.  So if we could recover by using the old Video app that would let us continue using the thousands of dollars of movies and shows that we paid for.\n\nA: My answer addresses the OP issue with TV.app, not reverting to the previous Videos.app. The functionality the OP wishes to have is available in the TV.app and that is what my answer addresses.\nI know this question is a little old, but I had the same issue with the new TV.app seeing my local Home Sharing library. This question is also addressed/answered here as well.\nHome Sharing libraries under the library menu at the top of the TV.app do not appear until;\n\n\n*\n\n*Home Sharing is setup on all devices. And...\n\n*Content is downloaded from the iTunes Store (e.g. a single free tv show.)\n\n\nStep 2 seems to trigger the TV.app to make Home Sharing available. Once this is done your Home Sharing library will be visible in the menu and you will be able to access and view your content from the shared library on the device.\nThe below image is my iPad showing our local Home Sharing library iMac Library in the TV.app on iOS 10.3.1 - Hope this answer helps others.\n\n", "Q: How do I make the mouse click at current location using AppleScript?

WHY?\nHow can I play my music through iTunes without a Wi-Fi connection?\n\nA: I traced the problem down to a TLS handshake and a total of 63 packets between the host and 23.211.148.217, which is init.iTunes.apple.com - that is executed when the current version of iTunes is started. Once this handshake completes, all is fine. But you must tunnel traffic to this host on startup, otherwise you get the error with each and every song change.\nYou can play music without wifi if you have an internet connection when you start iTunes. So, connect your laptop to the internet and do not turn it off/close iTunes, just put it to sleep. Then, the error will not appear. Not a fix, but it works.\n\nA: Are the songs you are trying to play on iCloud, or actually downloaded to your computer's hard drive?  Sometimes it can appear that they are but the song is actually not stored locally.\nAnd if it is stored on your hard drive, sometimes something moves the file and iTunes loses track of where it is located.  You can right click on the name and use Get Info (or the equivalent for your version of iTunes) to see the file path.\nThere was also an issue with one version of iTunes where it deleted non-iTunes music for some users until they fixed that.\n", "Q: How can I fix permissions for files in the /var/folders/zz? How can I fix permissions for files in the /var/folders/zz?\nThere are a lot of file under /var/folders/zz that seem to be application caches or some sort. \nI am interested in this because, it appears that if the permissions of these folders get set incorrectly (and there is a lot of \"help\" out there that suggests changing these at one time or another) it can easily break the applications that use them, like Apple Software Update, Apple Setup Assistant, Adobe Flash Installer, and many others.\nNote: This asks a different (although similar) question to the one found in Can I delete files or folders from /private/var/folders/?, and provides a correct & concise answer to this specific question. It is also not about clearing space, but about fixing permissions on these files, which when incorrect WILL break applications.\n\nA: These application cache directories can be deleted and will be re-created with proper permissions, after a reboot and the various parent applications are re-launched.\nThere is a lot of confusing half-responses to this question online, but it is safe to delete these folders, and this is a foolproof way to correct permissions. However, it is important that you only delete the underlying folders and do not delete the /var/folders/zz folder itself. There has been at least one bug reported that the OS will not automatically re-create the zz directory (although this may be fixed now).\nIt is very likely that the system will prevent some of the folders from being deleted. This is usually fine as well.\nAfter deleting the folders, you should reboot immediately.\nsudo rm -rf /var/folders/zz/zy*\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nWhen the system boots and related application start up, the required directories will automatically be re-created with the proper permissions.\n\nSome things that this fix can solve, include:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Adobe Flash Installer always failing to install.\n\n\n*\n\n*see: https://forums.adobe.com/message/9192807#9192807\n\n\n*Apple Software Update failing to install anything.\n\n\n*\n\n*see: Software Update Permissions error\n\n\n*Apple Setup Assistant or the login screen showing question marks for all font characters.\n\n\n*\n\n*see: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7696662?start=0&tstart=0\n\n\n*and likely many other things.\n\n\n\nMore Details:\nsee: http://www.magnusviri.com/OS_X_Admin/what-is-var-folders.html\nsee: https://osxbytes.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/boot-hang-after-deleting-var-folders/comment-page-1/\n", "Q: Only Macintosh shown on Startup Manager after Windows 10 32-bit Boot Camp install I installed Boot Camp with Windows 10 32-bit, but it doesnt give me the option to switch my Mac into Windows. Any help? I've tried holding option when restarting it but only the Macintosh box appears.\n\nA: 32-bit versions of Windows 10 are not supported on any Mac model. You need to install the 64-bit version.\nFrom Apple KB: How to install Windows using Boot Camp\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have everything you need:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*An Intel-based Mac\n  \n*A Microsoft Windows installation media or disk image (ISO) containing a 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows 8 or later\n  \n\nSee this list for which Mac models support Windows 10.\n", "Q: Game performance halved with screen mirroring on macOS When I run Portal on my MBP with no external screen connected I get a solid 60 fps. When I connect and mirror another screen (same resolution and game settings) it drops to 30 fps, sometimes 20, and has a very noticeable impact on game experience.\nIt's the same regardless of which video output port I use.\nGraphics power saving is disabled.\nI have tried to find confirmation that screen mirroring negatively affects performance, but I've only stumbled upon assertions that it doesn't and shouldn't. But I've tested this many times and it's very reproducible.\n\n\n*\n\n*How is mirroring implemented / why does it affect performance this much?\n\n*Is the only way to get decent game performance to buy an external keyboard and close the lid / tape a magnet to the screen / use terminal hack?\n\n\nMBP 15\" mid 2014\nUpdate on V-sync\nAs Phong correctly suspected, it's related to vsync. Without it I get some ridiculous 150+ fps and good responsiveness, although I'm reluctant to turn it off because of the tearing.\nIt's still a bit of a mystery how screen mirroring is interacting with and affecting vsync though.\nThe MBP screen is 60 Hz, and the external screen also receives a 60 Hz signal. Changing the game resolution doesn't affect the video signal (always 1080p), but matching the output and game resolution (e.g. 720p@60) still gives similar symptoms.\n\nA: Sounds to me like you have Vertical Synchronization enabled. This feature locks your frame rate to a fraction of your display’s refresh rate (1, ½, ⅓…) to prevent visual artifacting (specifically, “tearing”) and runaway frame rates (which may damage a GPU). A pretty good indication of this is a frame rate that jumps from 30 to 60 FPS and back, with nothing in-between.\nMirroring is affecting performance just enough to drop your frame rate below 60 FPS. Even if you would otherwise get 59 FPS, Vertical Synchronization would drop your frame rate to 30 FPS.\nThis may also result in input lag. Since your screen/cursor is now redrawn half (or one-third) as frequently, the delay between you moving the mouse and seeing the result on the screen would be twice or three-times as long.\nGo into Portal’s video settings and Disable Vertical Synchronization. I don’t play Portal, but almost every game has that option. It may be named V-Sync.\nYou may need to switch from Windowed mode to Full Screen. Since macOS forces V-Sync for the main desktop, V-Sync may still be enforced while playing in a window.\nTo minimize the adverse effects of disabling V-Sync, many games offer the option to cap your frame rate. If that option is available, try setting a maximum of, eg. 90 FPS or even 60 FPS. This often offers the best of both worlds.\nSee if a combination of these solutions resolves your problem.\nIf you’d rather keep V-Sync enabled, many games offer an option to enable Triple-Buffering. This will help smooth out your frame rates (therefore minimizing sudden drops in frame rates). Enabling it may also result in increased input lag, though usually not as severe as one caused by dropping 30 FPS.\nOne last suggestion would be to try to extend your desktop onto the external display as a separate Space instead (possible with Yosemite and above, I believe). Does your use-case even require Mirroring? I’m not all that familiar with this on the Mac, but I don’t see why this wouldn’t be possible.\nBird’s-eye explanation of what’s causing your frame rate drops with Mirroring:\nWith Mirroring, your Mac has to display the same frame to your internal display and to your external display. In addition to causing your displays to wait on each other, this involves additional “work” including extra computational time and buffer management (to make sure they’re displaying the same thing at the same time), as well as the round-trip delay over your external cable or worse, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.\nWhile this is happening, your GPU is rendering the next frame in its internal buffer, but doesn’t send it to your display until it gets the OK (because of V-Sync). During this wait period, your GPU is effectively paused, not rendering additional frames (unless Triple- or N-Buffering is available), which further reduces your frame rate. Then, depending on where the slowest display is at in its refresh cycle, display of the next frame may be delayed yet again to the next fraction.\nYou have to keep in mind that in order to render your game at 60 FPS, your graphics subsystem only has 33ms to perform all that extra work (minus the time needed by the GPU to render those frames in the first place). The roundtrip to and from your external display alone may take a couple of milliseconds. Synchronization work is in and of itself costly (time-wise). It’s not unfathomable that synchronizing two displays takes more than 20 or 30 milliseconds.\nNow, in the previous paragraph I was assuming that your GPU was ready with the next frame by the time your displays were done drawing the current one. Imagine that it wasn’t. Well, now the displays are starved, and they’re the ones that end up waiting on the GPU. You probably end up dropping to the next fraction of your slowest refresh rate. What might mean a 1-2 FPS drop V-Sync Off turns into a 30 FPS with it On.\nSo you’re trying to synchronize two displays (through Mirroring), then trying to synchronize THOSE against your GPU (through V-Sync). The result is potentially lots and lots and lots of waiting.\nIt is not unusual to experience some performance degradation when connecting subsystems with disparate performance levels. That is why buffers and asynchronous operations were created.\nWhen synchronizing, a delay anywhere causes delays everywhere.\nTo maximize performance, best let everyone do their job on their own time.\n\nA: Condensing some info on what worked in the end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vsync enabled\n\n*Separate desktops on each monitor\n\n*Move main desktop (the menu bar in macOS screen setup) to the screen you want to play on. Portal can select a monitor in-game, but macOS will screw with the cursor anyway unless you play on the main screen so that option is useless.\n\n*Dim the other screen down.\n\n\nSame thing for Portal 2. Unlike the first game it also supports triple buffering.\nUsing apps like DisableMonitor only complicates things. You somehow end up with the disabled monitor's coordinate system (and desktop background) overlaid onto the enabled one, making cursors appear where they aren't. The developer seems to have taken precautions by the looks of this line: CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(kCGWindowListExcludeDesktopElements, kCGNullWindowID), but that just doesn't seem to stick -- at least not in macOS sierra.\n", "Q: How do I restart the cron service on OSX? ProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.11.6\nBuildVersion:   15G31\n\n$ sudo cron restart\ncron: cron already running, pid: 257`\n\nNone of the answers in here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10193788/restarting-cron-after-changing-crontab-file seem to apply to OSX. Well the one above is the closest one but it appears to be just telling me that cron is running so I don't have to worry about restarting it. Which isn't the point of restarting something. \nHow do I stop and restart the cron service on a Mac? \n\nA: sudo pkill -f cron\n\nThe LaunchDaemon has a keepalive section in it that will immediately restart it.\n\nA: From the cron man page:\n\nThe cron utility is launched by launchd(8) when it sees the existence\n  of /etc/crontab or files in /usr/lib/cron/tabs.  There should be no\n  need to start it manually.  See\n  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist for details.\n\nSo, interstingly enough, cron is launched by launchd.  However, according to man crontab\n\n(Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are\n  officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been\n  absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of\n  automatically executing commands. See launchctl(1) for more\n  information.)\n\nSo, cron which is launched by launchd, has been deprecated for launchd.  Using cron is like wrapping bacon in bacon because you want bacon flavored bacon.\nAs far as restarting cron, there is no need.  Once it sees a crontab file, it will automatically launch the job.  \nHowever, it's highly advisable that you start scheduling jobs using launchd.\n\nA: The cron daemon is managed with launchctl.\nIf you insist on restarting it, you have to unload and load the respective launch daemon:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist\n\nBut: adding or removing arbitrary crontabs shouldn't require a reload of the daemon to enable or disable them.\nThe above launch daemon plist contains a Watch Directory directive which detects (crontab) file creation and deletion or modified dates and \"instructs\" cron respectively.\n", "Q: screen zooms randomly on iMac 2012 iMac running el capitan 10.11.6\nscreen zooms in and out randomly. does it with video and maps most often. \n\nA: Check if you enabled trackpad smart zoom in System Preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Got to system Preferences Apple Icon > System Preferences > Trackpad\n\n*Click Scroll & Zoom tab\n\n*Check the zoom options and uncheck Smart Zoom\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I open Mobile Sync?

bars and left the one in the lower slot: the macbook crashed immediately. \nTHEN: I put the same RAM bar into the upper slot and since then I didn't have any crashes ..\nstill don't know what this means... Is it about the RAM or is it about the Motherboard? Does it make sense to buy new RAM for the other buggy slot?\nedit:\nFirst: AHT didnt show any errors.\nSecond: I tested all possible configuration with my RAM and used the macbook for a while:\nAny RAM-Module would work in the upper RAM-slot.\nBut putting the RAM into the lower slot, it crashes, no matter which RAM I use.\nSO the slot is broken and I'm tied to using only one RAM module?\n\nA: Okay, I ran apple hardwaretest with no results, downgraded to mountain lion (the last OS running without problems) and reset smc and pram, the macbook is still having random crashes. The only thing changed is that I get strange graphic glitches now and no crash reports anymore, before it was only randomly shut down..\nSo nothing changed I guess\n", "Q: Can I downgrade from macOS Sierra to Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6)? I have a 2016 MacBook.\nFirst, OS X El Capitan was installed. Now, I've installed Sierra.\nCan I downgrade to Snow Leopard?\nIf I can, is USB method okay? \n\nA: You cannot downgrade the 2016 MacBook Retina to OS X Snow Leopard.\nApple does not support running OS version older than the one shipped with the hardware. Refer to the article Use the Mac operating system that came with your Mac, or a compatible newer version:\n\nYour Mac is designed to work only with compatible macOS versions and builds. If you try to use an incompatible version or build, your Mac might behave unexpectedly.\nAvoid using a version of the Mac operating system that is older than what came with your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to force tethered data to go through an iOS VPN, instead of passing through raw to the mobile carrier? When tethering a cellular-capable iOS 10 device, the traffic from the remote machine seems to bypass the connect-as-needed VPN and go directly to the cellular network. Local iOS device traffic starts and uses the VPN as usual, but web sites visited from the remote machine see the mobile IP address, not the VPN IP address (regardless of whether the VPN is on at the time of the visit or not).\nOne purpose of a VPN is to shield traffic from the prying eyes of the (mobile) ISP. Is there a way to force tethered traffic through the VPN (other than by putting the VPN on the remote machine)?\n\nA: No, it seems that's not possible.\nI have made several tests with different VPNs and VPN settings on my iPhone - some on demand, some not, but even when switched on manually, tethered traffic was never sent through the VPN.\nI've also tried setting OverridePrimary to true as described here (it is false by default when creating the profile in the Apple Configurator), but that did not change the tethered traffic either.\nThe remaining solution is to install the VPN connection on your tethering client. \nBTW, if that client is a Mac, you can simply import the same VPN profile by double-clicking on the mobileconfig file created for iOS.\n", "Q: VGA display no longer being recognized by Late 2016 MBP OS Sierra It's the weirdest thing!  It used to work perfectly.  My TV at home does not have HDMI, but the VGA input works great.\n  When I ordered this new MBP, I got all adapters from Apple.\n  Today is when things got weird:\nWhen I plug in thunderbolt 3 -> VGA I get nothing.\nWhen I plug in thunderbolt 3 -> thunderbolt 2 -> VGA I get nothing.\nHOWEVER, if I plug in the single TB3 -> VGA - ONLY directly after trying the above two adapters - it works.  I'm saying the first adapter I tried works one single time, but only after trying to plug the same thing in using the second two adapters.\nWhat the heck could this be?\n\nA: It's a bug.  If I leave the USB-C adapter plugged in, the VGA can be connected and disconnected without issue.  That's the only way, other than my weird multi-adapter method.  Kinda sucks to have to leave the adapter in, but that is the only way.\n  I actually got a whole new MBP just for this issue, and the new one acted exactly the same BEFORE I imported any files or settings.\n", "Q: Office 365 keeps prompting for login credentials on Mac OSX? Office 365 keeps prompting for login credentials within Mac OSX? I came across a problem where a client of mine had bought and installed Office Suite 2016 she than upgraded to Office 365 Business Premium.\n\nA: Here is what solved it for me. (Copied from: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/authentication-failedcheck-your-account/063826c1-1e4c-40ba-9bfa-54e745925fc1 )\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all Office applications (Word, Teams, Outlook, etc)\n\n*Go to KeyChain Access.\n\n*Search \"Exchange\" under Login --> All Items and delete everything.\n\n*Search \"Office\" and delete everything.\n\n*Search \"ADAL\" and delete everything.\n\n*Launch Outlook.\n\n*You will get the activation prompt and then If account is already added you will see the password prompt for app and ADAL again. Please do 2-Factor Authentication if asked to.\n\n*If that doesn't work, do steps 2-4 but restart the Mac before launching Outlook.\n\n\nA: I had to uninstall office suite and clear keychain for Microsoft Office, once that was established Office 365 no longer kept prompting for key and user credentials. Hope this helps! \n\nA: My issue was that, every time upon starting Outlook, I was prompted to \"Sign in with your organizational account\". I fixed it by going to Preferences > Accounts, removing my account, and adding it again.\n\nA: Removing (deleting) the exchange account in Outlook, letting it fully delete, then adding it again as recommended by ognockocaten worked for me! \nThis problem showed up after changing the user's login name on O365. \n", "Q: Why can't I delete certain photos off of my iPhone? I cannot delete things off of my photos app on my iPhone. When I select any pictures there is no trash bin displayed to actually delete them. How can I proceed with deleting photos on the phone?\n\nA: To delete pictures within the iOS Photos app, open Photos, tap on the text at top right\n\nthen select the photos you want to delete (so they get a blue checkmark) and tap on the Trash icon at bottom right.\n\nPS: If this is not what you are seeing on your phone, please add more details to the question.\n", "Q: How to get data on HW RAID 5 without initializing disk? RocketRAID eSATA connection died but USB3 works and shows RAID5 OK? What the pluck moment with my hardware RAID: \neSATA connection to my SansDigital external 5-bay tower stopped working, not sure why, card definitely warm. \nShut everything down, disconnected the eSATA cable, connected via USB3.\nMy hardware RAID 5 status shows good in SansDigital HW RAID utility when connected via USB3.0; however, the OS does now say\n\"The disk you inserted is not readable by this computer\".\nThis is on a Mac Pro Server Quad Xeon 3.2GHz (MacPro5,1) mid 2012 running OS X 10.7.5 (Lion) and a HighPoint RocketRAID RR622SD eSATA/USB3 card. SansDigital 5-bay external drive enclosure. \nIs it a legitimate error when a hardware RAID 5 reports as OK on the remaining USB3 interface but the the OS says \"The disk you inserted is not readable by this computer\" (since the eSATA connection is the dead connection)? Or is my hardware RAID 5 borked and does not interpret it that way? \nIs it possible to get to the data on the drive again without initializing the disk? \nWhat does the drive initialization process do differently when a hardware level 5 RAID is involved (versus a regular drive initialization) - - is there a way to get to the data outside of the RAID 5 array (if absolutely necessary)?\nIs there anything I can look at in the console that will point me in the right direction?\n  Thanks, \n    Claire\n\nA: Here is a dead RAID post-mortem (hopefully this will help my fellow AskDifferent friends)...\nI provide my experience here to help you move on from a bad hardware dependency and to confirm that eSATA is not for serious business critical applications.\nHardware RAID is like the Honey Badger - - it don't give a shit - - bad data is bad data.  \nFirst, if your RAID dies, focus on preserving the data.  Clone the RAID drives ASAP.  Use a separate system for recovery.\n   In the meantime, replace all of the hardware involved rather than trying to piecemeal troubleshooting the internal card, the eSATA cable, and the external RAID enclosure.  New problems popped up for me as I went along because I drank the Kool-Aid of \"it will be ok, my RAID hardware says my RAID is normal and intact\".\n   I learned that the term \"Initialize\" in the Highpoint hardware RAID utilities does not mean the same as Mac hard drive initialize.  The enclosure I was relying on had hardware RAID inside, but because the internal eSATA card was intermittently working a while before it completely failed, a majority of my drive data was corrupted.\n   Do not try to change the RAID settings with any utilities, including the Highpoint utilities, just clone the drives, recover the data, and come back to the problem system later. \n   My internal eSATA card had failed, but my enclosure had hardware RAID, so if you are in the same situation, do not treat it the same as a RAID pass-through card or a card-based RAID.  Do not take apart the RAID logically with utilities.  Do not pull even one drive out of the Sans Digital box or you will lose the RAID, period. Do not use DiskWarrior on the volume, it will break the file and folder structure beyond recovery in this situation.\n   Highpoint driver support for Mac is absolutely horrible for anything before Mac OS X 10.10, so let me save you the days of frustration and hours of your life from being wasted in dealing with Highpoint as I have. The Highpoint driver did not fail gracefully - - it dismounted my volume, froze my system for about twenty minutes, then when it came back, all of my launch services were trashed, and the keychain corrupted - - unreal.  I could not find any RAID settings within the settings files as they were before. I never backed up the external enclosure settings or the settings for the RAID card as I should have.  Other things were broken in my admin and my root accounts, so this became a complete OS recovery / reload as well.\n   Never throw away and driver CD or DVD for any piece of hardware you own.  I replaced the dead card with an exact replacement from Highpoint online, but the CD had changed, and the Highpoint Mac installer on the DVD did not work for Lion!  Yes, you heard me, the original card, same exact version, came with a CD that was different in that Highpoint had abandoned any version of Mac prior to OS X 10.8 - - all of the GUI for the web interface was there, but the HWRaidManager utility was not, and nothing worked as before.\n   Some more process monitoring on startup and comparison with data from the original drive content allowed me to trace the issue back to a couple of kext files.  Found some replacements online (even though the Highpoint tech support could not), and modified one of their newer installers to work with Lion.\n   Do not expect the drivers for the Highpoint RAID cards to work consistently on Lion.  Highpoint rebrands their hardware RAID utility for other vendors in the RAID market, and is so lazy they did not bother to make a different interface for Mac users.\n   The good news is Highpoint started reworking their drivers and Mac installer packages when they started having Mac OS X 10.8 permission issues. \n   Third, I started data recovery with third-party software.  I monitored how pathetic the external hardware was behaving by this point in the recovery process. \n   As I confirmed the last bits of data from the RAID volume were recovered, I promised myself that I will never buy another Highpoint product or any product which bundles a Highpoint card with it (such as the Sans Digital product line) again.\n   Going with a $5K setup in a 2U rackmount solution in a mini-SAS combo from ATTO and OWC instead.\n", "Q: Can the Apple menu be moved to the right a substantial amount (screen failure)? My macbook pro fell and the left side of the screen is now black. So about 20% of it is not visible due to breakage. I am working around this using an external display when I can locate one, but on the go I'd like to limp along until I can afford the repair. Is there a software solution for MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) Running macOS Sierra version 10.12 to adjust the screen resolution or placement to squeeze it without messing up proportions to the left so that it covers only the part that's not broken. \nIs there a way to manually adjust resolution through underscan/overscan (which is not visible to me for my own display) or through other means? \nI'm trying to push everything to the side so that it's visible (including the apple logo menu on the top left) \n\nI tried downloading DisableMonitor but it only sticks with proportions and doesn't allow me to push the content to the right. All the resolution switches assume the whole screen is working - I need to shift the content over and not otherwise change the scale of the remaining screen. \nBasically, can the window manager itself run in split screen mode with nothing critical shown in the left side split?\n\nA: Try to use RDM to set whatever you like, and its free/oss, so id recommend that. Also you can take a look at QuickRes which can (probably) do the same but it's not free. There is also SwitchResX you can try if it has anything you might need. \nUpdate: I found also this one here called resolutionator and there is a brew util I totally forgot about in cask cscreen, you can try to install it with brew brew cask install cscreen and then, for example: \ncscreen -d 32 -x 1420 -y 1080 -s b42e7f0 -r 59 -f\nYou can also try this gist: https://gist.github.com/ejdyksen/8302862\nAfter thinking about your issue seems to be in EDID. Also, what's your GPU in the MBP and what happens if you toggle the overscan option in pref's?\nI forgot that to apply this patch you need to disable Apple's System Integrity Protection with csrutil disable from Rescue mode and then into macOS again and (re)apply the script from gist by running it with ruby: cd ~/Downloads; sudo ruby patch-edid.rb (assuming Downloads is the folder where you saved it), then reboot again. \nTo reenable System Integrity Protection you need to csrutil enable from terminal in Rescue mode and reboot, then check csrutil status if it's working again.\nSoo.. the way I would try to solve your issue would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*check the custom resolutions options in one of the apps above, \n\n*set a custom resolution which does not include your damaged part of the screen \n\n*enforce that custom resolution.\n\n*if the enforcement is not doable through custom system prefs:\ninject custom EDID through clover during boot.\n\n*making sure that this solution is persistent after reboot\n\n\n\nUpdate 07/01/2017\nAfter some basic digging, there are native settings in macOS defaults .plist files that describe screen properties.

I've got a mid 2012 15\" unibody MBP, non retina (one of the last easily user serviceable ones).\nI have used it every day since I bought it in early 13 and the battery is pretty weak now, a full charge lasts about 1.5hrs. (the 2:29 remaining shown in the screenshot seems inaccurate when you actually use the laptop) \nIf I click on the battery tab I get this service icon. Ideally I don't want to have to book an appointment, go to the apple store, lose use of my laptop for a day etc. \nCan I purchase an official Apple battery directly from Apple and do the change my self? (I know there are lots of 3rd party batteries on Amazon / eBay, but I want a genuine part.) \n\n\nA: According to several sites, which mostly point back to this iFixit page, \"...Apple informs its own service personnel that 'batteries must be replaced with the top case assembly' and that 'the battery alone is not a replaceable part.'\"\nAlso, iFixit found the following when trying to remove the battery:\n\n\n*\n\n*Someone really did not want the battery in the MacBook Pro to come out of the upper case.\n\n*We tried valiantly with our iFixit 6 Inch Metal Ruler to free the battery from its aluminum confines, but to no avail. Rather than risk puncturing a lithium-polymer battery cell, we left the power source in place.\n\n*To complicate matters further, the TrackPad cable lies underneath the battery. Attempting to pry the battery off the upper case could easily sever the fragile cable, which would be bad.\n\n\nIt might be best to just take it to Apple to get the battery replaced.  It appears to cost US $200 for a new battery.\n", "Q: Do I need a router with Mac and these firewall settings? I am single home user in one apartment with no other users, living apartment block house with over hundred apartments.\nI have cable internet and one modem.\nMac firewall has \"block all incoming connections\" and \"enable stealth mode\" enabled.\nAll sharing services are disabled.\nDo I need a router? All ports are disabled with these settings (I assume at least) so is router needed? \n\nA: You only need a router if you want to \"route\" a network connection to more than 1 device. \nIf you only want to have 1 device connected to your network then you don't need a router. If you add another network-enabled device (TV, printer, another computer, etc), then you will need a router to share & control the network traffic. \n\nA: Fsb is correct that you only need a router if you wish to connect to your network with another device. \nBut this doesn't mean you necessarily have to add a physical router. Instead, you can connect to your modem with Ethernet cable (if you aren't already) and then use the Sharing options in your System Preferences to share your internet via Wifi. This would allow other devices (such as an iPhone) to connect to a new wifi network setup by your Mac because your Mac has become the router for you!\n", "Q: How many external HD (not 4K or 5K) displays can I use with the 2016 13\" MacBook Pro with Touchbar? How many external HD (not 4K or 5K) external displays can I use with the 2016 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, using multiple HDMI to Type-C adapters?\nThe Touch Bar models also have 4 Type-C ports and an Intel Iris Graphics 550, not an Intel Iris Graphics 540 like the base model.\n\nA: Officially it will support one display at 5120 x 2880 pixels at 60 Hz or up to two displays at 4096 x 2304 pixels at 60 Hz. Of course, this is the 5K and 4K you're probably already aware of.\nHowever, unofficially you could use more than two external displays via various adaptors, at or below the above resolutions. How many you can use will depend on the specs of the actual displays used. Also, you need to be aware that your MBP fans may start spinning at much faster speeds depending on your setup.\nYou may find the following info of interest to you. While not directly about the 2016 MBP, the info is still relevant.\n", "Q: How to stop audio from \"warbling\" when using SoundFlower My system consists of a 2011 iMac running Mavericks, and using an external audio interface (iConnectAudio4+) along with a Bluetooth speaker and Airfoil to create a \"surround\" effect for music while I'm working.\nThe issue is specific to SoundFlower, which I must use or I can't adjust the computer volume at all (volume control gets greyed out).  My routing for this setup is as follows:\nMac Audio Output > SoundFlower > iConnectAudio4+\nAirfoil's audio source is typically iTunes and its speakers are the computer, and the Bluetooth speaker.  When I have this set up, everything works fine, except that periodically audio will begin to drift and sounds a lot like a warped cassette tape.  It's very noticeable especially on any sort of sustained notes (pianos, voice, etc.).\nIf I remove SoundFlower from the equation and simply route System audio direct to the iConnectAudio4+, the problem goes away but I am no longer able to adjust the Mac audio levels via the OS.\nIn my experience getting this to work, I have to use Airfoil because any other solution such as simply creating a multi-output device of the audio interface and BT speaker, results in a significant and non-adjustable delay between the two.  Airfoil allows for dialing in the latency so that everything is in near perfect sync around me.\nMy question could be seen as 2 part:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to use this setup as I have described but eliminate the audio warping?\n\n*Is there a different way to set my system up which would give me the same end result (including ability to adjust Mac volume via the OS) but without audio warping?\n\n\nA: Apparently the issue may lie in SoundFlowerBed, not SoundFlower itself.  But since SFB is an abandoned project... it is unlikely to ever be made more robust.\nFortunately I think I've found a solution, which is Sound Siphon.  I'm using it exactly as I would have with SoundFlower - routing my system sound and AirFoil to Sound Siphon, and sending Sound Siphon out to my audio interface.  \nSeems to be working perfectly, no audio warbling, and I can still adjust my overall system volume with the usual OS controls.  Plus, the demo version allows unlimited use of System Audio, which is all I was after... so this solution is even free!\n", "Q: No entry for system.log in /etc/newsyslog.conf In How can I extend the time when system.log gets turned over? and How to find recently connected external disks? it says that /etc/newsyslog.conf should have an entry for /var/log/system.log that I can edit to change how often this log file is rotated and how many old versions are kept. But on my system there's no entry for this file. The contents of my file are (omitting the big block of comments at the top):\n# logfilename          [owner:group]    mode count size when  flags [/pid_file] [sig_num]\n/var/log/ftp.log            640  5     1000 *     J\n/var/log/hwmond.log         640  5     1000 *     J\n/var/log/ipfw.log           640  5     1000 *     J\n/var/log/lpr.log            640  5     1000 *     J\n/var/log/ppp.log            640  5     1000 *     J\n/var/log/wtmp               644  3     *    @01T05 B\n\nI also looked in the files in /etc/newsyslog.d, none of them contain system.log, either.\nSo how does system.log get rotated now, and is there a setting I can change to control it?\n\nA: An answer was posted in this ServerFault question.\nConfiguration of system.log moved in 10.9 to /etc/asl.conf. It should have a section like:\n# Rules for /var/log/system.log\n> system.log mode=0640 format=bsd rotate=seq compress file_max=5M all_max=50M\n? [= Sender kernel] file system.log\n?

Here's the problem:\nIf I shoot in continuous mode, I can have several images per second.  Aperture will happily import these and rename them with Date @ Time, but subsequently sorting either by version name or by file name will bring results up in mixed order for a given time stamp.\nMy camera supports the exif field subsectimeorginal and the field shows up in Aperture, but in Aperture, the field is always blank.  And there is no primitive to add this to to creating filenames anyway.\n\nA: The solution is to avoid direct import by Aperture.  Import them onto the disk using your camera software, or by using a card reader, or if you camera is suppored as a 'device' then direct copy in Finder.\nRun the command:\nexiftool  -d %Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S '-filename<${datetimeoriginal}.${subsectimeoriginal}.%e'\n\nThis will format the filename as \n2016-12-09_20-27-21.20.JPG  \n2016-12-25_14-29-00.70.NEF\n\nExiftool can be downloaded from here: \nhttp://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/\nNote that the subsecond time can be either a 2 or 3 digit number -- either centiseconds or milliseconds. My d7100 reports 2 digits, but the last one is always zero.  So internally it's using a decisecond timer.\n", "Q: Can I replace my charger twice if its under warranty? I have a problem: due to high power electricity my charger was damaged and I had to replace it - an Apple 13 inch MacBook Air charger. This has happened already once before, a month ago, and now it has happened again.\nI want to know if, having replaced the charger previously one or two months ago, and now that the replacement charger has been damaged via the same issue (i.e. high power electricity), can I replace it again under warranty without any cost? What can I do if the Apple Care Centre in my city refuses to replace my charger the second time around?\n\nA: I have no idea what you mean by High power electricity, but generally Apple will replace something as many times as necessary while it's under the warranty period so long as you haven't damaged it in some way. \nYour question implies that your chargers were not faulty, so if Apple determines that they've been damaged, you may be out of luck. However, if the chargers are supposed to be able to manage whatever it is you mean by High power electricity, then they should still be covered as something isn't working properly.\nOf course, this assumes that by damaged you mean it no longer works, rather than just some sort change in cosmetic appearance.\nRegardless, the only way to find out is to ask Apple. If you get no joy and feel that a replacement is honestly warranted, then your local consumer laws may offer a process you can avail yourself of.\n\nA: Apple returned and replaced with new one :)\n", "Q: How can I run an application which is outside Applications folder? Suppose that I move a.app outside /Applications to somewhere like ~/Downloads/MyApp (Note that I drop the extension). How can I run it from there using terminal?\nI tried open -a but it says ... cannot be opened because its executable is missing.\n\nA: It's not quite that easy.\nTypical structure of an app:\nMyApp.app\n  Contents\n    _CodeSignature\n    Frameworks\n    Helpers\n    info.plist\n    MacOS\n      MyApp <<<<<<<<\n    PkgInfo\n    Resources\n\nSo in terminal you would open\n/Path/To/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp\nThis doesn't work for all apps, but will work for most that are installed by a drag and drop.\nIf you want to launch them from finder, and associated them, but you just don't have the room  then in a terminal window:\nsudo ln -s /Path/To/MyApp.app /Applications\nThis constructs a symbolic link in /Applications to where MyApp.app really lives.\nIndeed if you are booting from a small disk, you may be able to move some applications off of the boot volume and put them on an external disk, replacing them with symbolic links.\nSome applications install stuff into /Library.  To get these apps to run in different places takes a lot more work.  \nBe cautious doing this with anything required for routine running.  You can get your mac into an unusable state.  If you want to play around with in a serious way, install Virtual Box on your mac, install another copy of MacOS in your virtual box, and play there.

If I install malicious software (which is meant for Windows) using Wine on my Mac, will that malicious application be able to affect my computer at all? (For example, see/do things to files outside of the .wine directory, slow down my computer.)\nIf a malicious application can do this, is there a way to sandbox Wine?\n\nA: Using WINE to run the software makes it effectively a Mac application, with all the privileges of the user.  The upside of that is that if you are running it in a non-admin account, it shouldn't be able to damage the actual system.\nHowever, if you are linking in DLLs from Windows, and the software takes advantage of flaws in those DLLs, I am not sure what to say about it.\nFor example, I have used Windows to find out the libraries that an executable depends on, then copied those libraries with the executable into a Wineskin wrapper to make a Mac \"port\" of the app.\n\nA: Wine presents the Windows .exe you are trying to run a virtual Windows environment and ports the graphics and HID to the Mac system.\nIn essence, Wine is a bio-containment glovebox. It is very unlikely, due to the nature of wrapper-based ports which basically sandbox the .exe.\nI wouldn't be concerned about malicious software running through Wine unless it exploits DLLs that are loaded onto your computer. And since Wine is an app, it can be terminated fairly easily and does not usually run with superuser privileges (unless otherwise initiated with them).\n", "Q: No sound in Photobooth recorded videos I have no sound in my videos recorded in Photobooth.

This is a bit problematic on a Mac as it is rarely even possible to remove and re-install a video driver, which would be a simple and free first step.\nDepending on what is going on you may want to update (or re-upadte) your system with the latest combo updater. With the hopes that it will re-install or update the current video driver with a 'clean' version.\nI would, however, be tempted to run a cleaner/maintenance app to make sure there are no corrupted cache files and all necessary maintenance scripts and disk/filesystem repairs are done before running the combo updater. My recommendation would be the free utility Onyx. Download and run it (First quit out of all open apps), give it your password and allow it to verify your disk. Then use the automation tab and let it do it's thing. Reboot when done and apply the Combo updater.\nAfter that reboot if the issue has not gone away and you are sure it is not related to any specific app or family of apps (like all your Adobe apps that might share a graphics library...) it may be a hardware issue, which could be diagnosed at an Apple store with a Genius Bar appointment.\nIf you want to try one more thing and have the time and equipment, you might consider installing a fresh copy of macOS on an external drive along with one or two of the apps that demonstrate the issue most readily. Possibly even a different version of the OS than you currently use. This would show if the combo updater really fixed any video driver issues and guarantee a clean OS and application install. In effect eliminating any and all software variables lurking in your current system,\n", "Q: No input field for Apple ID Verification Code I have an older iPad Mini and when I try and use a game iOS Game Center asks for my password, which I enter, and is accepted. Then it asks to type in the Apple ID Verification Code, although there is nowhere to type it in. \n\nEDIT: Thanks to fsb's suggestion the verification code was accepted by typing it directly after the password into the Game Center login password field. I'm shocked Apple would expect anyone to know to do this without prior knowledge!\n\nA: Late Edit:\nDue to more than one person being confused by the term 'followed by' & just to be clear…\nFirst you must close the dialog telling you to do this, to get back to the password entry field.\nThen, if your password is pa55word and your verification code is 123456, then in the password field you must enter pa55word123456 all in one string at one time.\n\nAccording to this Apple Support page, the issue is two-factor authentication with older devices/iOS.\n\nWhat if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older software?\nIf you use two-factor authentication with devices running older OS versions, you might be asked to add your six-digit verification code to the end of your password when signing in.\n\n\nGet your verification code from a trusted device running iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later, or have it sent to your trusted phone number. Then type your password followed by the six-digit verification code directly into the password field without any spaces between the password and the verification code.\n\n", "Q: What words trigger the screen effects in iMessage?

I moved the trackpad to the slowest setting, and the mouse to the fastest. The trackpad was slow and the mouse was fast. The two did not seem to affect each other.\nThe answer should be to move each to the setting that works for you. \nCould you elaborate more on what happens when your adjustments affect each other? Have you tried setting each to a different extreme to see what happens?\n\nA: I would try something like USB Overdrive to have the system setting for acceleration for one device and then see if you can skip that device in USB Overdrive. Then use overdrive to set a different (faster or slower) acceleration than the default.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/Step.html\nThere are a lot of other modifiers like Better Touch Tool that many people love and use - but I don’t think any of the others have this differential speed setting that seems a natural thing to want.

I would like to know how to stop Mail app on iOS 9.3.5 from automatically downloading the mail attachments.

You can stop iOS Mail from downloading remote images as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on Mail\n\n*Under the Messages heading, toggle Load Remote Images off\n\n\nIn terms of stopping other attachments (e.g. MS Word documents etc), there is no such option to prevent downloading these. However, the way it should work is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*When your iPhone is connected to the internet via a cellular network, any email attachments over a certain size will not download automatically.\n\n*Instead, for these attachments you would have to manually select them in the body of the email to download them.\n\n*When your iPhone is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi, all email attachments will download automatically.\n\n\nAs far as I'm aware there is no way to stop this, although there may be 3rd party email apps that give you this option.\nIf you're sure that emails are taking up a lot of space on your iPhone, you may need to rethink how regularly you delete older emails.

Can I disable the use of battery, and only turn it on when it's plugged in with a power adapter? \nSometimes when it's plugged in it's still showing \"not charging\" and displaying 1%, and operates very slowly. So I guess if I can always only use the power adapter, it can be faster than 1% \"low battery mode\".\nI can't find any related setting in Preferences. Please help, thanks.\n\nA: First of all, your MacBook Air should not run slower, even with a dead battery, if it's connected to AC power.\nSecondly, you really should replace the battery, but if you don't want to physically remove the battery, the nearest option to what you want to achieve is to adjust your Energy Saver settings.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Choose Energy Saver\n\n*Ensure you have the Battery tab selected\n\n*Now adjust your settings under the Battery tab to suit your needs (perhaps ensure they match as far as possible the settings under the Power Adapter tab).\n\n\nYou may also want to uncheck the option to show the battery status in the menu bar (as that will only be a constant reminder that annoys you under the present circumstances).\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*My steps above are fairly generic as you didn't specify your OS, however they should get you to where you need.\n\n*If you're certain your computer is running 'slowly' then it's quite possible you have something else going on.\n\n*Finally, you may want to reset your SMC for good measure.

I learned from Apple that they go into an \"invisible\" trash folder, but I can't find it.  \nHow do I find this folder and delete it for good?  I need space on my startup disc.\n\nA: Your question is actually based on a misunderstanding of how deleting files works (not a criticism - many people get confused by this because the process can be different based on OS and the type of storage device).\nIn a nutshell, if your only concern is that you want to free up space on your startup disk, then emptying the Trash will have already done this (regardless of how you emptied it). This is because emptying the Trash means the OS no longer has a record of the data you emptied, and this means wherever the data was stored is now free for the OS to overwrite with new data. In other words, that space is now available (free) for you to use.\nA bit more detail\nYour comment that you emptied the trash \"non-securely\" actually has no bearing on free disk space. The option to securely erase data basically means that the data is actually overwritten with random data. This makes it a lot harder to recover the original data (hence the term secure) but it's still writing data to that space. However, once complete, as with a normal empty trash the OS has no record of that space being used and therefore it is now free space.\nTrash keyboard shortcuts\nThe following keyboard shortcuts may be of interest to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*CommandDelete - moves any selected item(s) to the Trash. (If you've selected an item already in the trash it'll then put them back to their original location.)\n\n*ShiftCommandDelete - Empties the Trash.\n\n*OptionShiftCommandDelete - Empties the Trash as above, but without a confirmation dialog box.\n\n", "Q: Detect failed local login attempts I'm using macOS Sierra and when I try to view failed login attempts, grep doesn't return any results because the keyword has probably changed or I'm looking in the wrong place.

How can I make my  computer not notice when I turn off my screen? I have a Dell monitor and a Mac Mini with macOS Sierra.\n\nA: I suspect the best way to manage your situation is via some of your System Preference settings. \nMore specifically, try the following and let me know how you go:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences \n\n*Select Energy Saver\n\n*Set your Computer Sleep to Never\n\n*Set your Display Sleep to a short period\n\n*Ensure that Put hard disks to sleep when possible is unchecked\n\n*Now exit Energy Saver and select Desktop & Screen Saver instead\n\n*Select the Screen Saver tab\n\n*Ensure that the Start after setting at bottom left is set to Never\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nNow try using your Mac Mini as you want, but don't turn off your monitor until after it has gone to sleep. Let me know how you go.\nSleep\nAs an aside, is there a reason you want to physically turn your monitor off?\nYour monitor uses less than 0.3W when it's in sleep mode, so you're not really saving much in terms of energy by shutting it off instead of letting it sleep. So, if you set your Energy Saver settings as above, the amount of energy consumption while your monitor sleeps is negligible and your Mac Mini can still perform what it has to.\n\nA: For future reference, if you connect your monitor through DVI (I use a Thunderbolt-to-DVI adapter) it seems the Mac won't be able to tell if the monitor is on or off.\nI don't know if that's specific to my Thunderbolt-to-DVI case, but I would guess it's on the DVI end.\n", "Q: Magic trackpad starts pairing but does not complete succesfully with one Macbook I have two Macbook pro retina's:  \n\n\n*\n\n*MbPro 15\" retina late 2015 El Capitan\n\n*MbPro 15\" retina mid 2012 El Capitan\n\n\nThe first one is able to pair with the Magic Trackpad (not the \"2\" - instead the older version).\nBut the 2012 one has the following behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*initially detects the trackpad -including showing the serial #\n\n*but then cannot complete the pairing - and I'm back to square one.\n\n\nThe initial detection of the trackpad happened several times. \n\nBut usually I do not even get that far: the trackpad is simply not detected.\nThere is obviously no problem with signal or batteries (new): the trackpad works all day on the other MBPro.\nWhat should I look for as potential culprits and fixes?\n\nA: Just found a related question and answer: apparently the trackpad can only be paired with one mac at a time - even if the other one were powered off (as is the case here)\nHow can I pair my Magic Trackpad with multiple Macs?\n", "Q: Why is Photos.app taking 2 months to scan faces for recognition?

Most of the work is done by the computer.  :-) \n\n\n*\n\n*Exported all my photos from my library as full-sized photos, choosing PNG formats, for optimal size without data loss.  This full export required some time to download missing photos from iCloud, but it reassured me that no photo information was lost.  It also detected all my \"problem\" photos that were corrupt or missing on the local hard drive.  And of course the exported photos serve as a crude but real backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure to export the photos as full sized photos!  In other words, don't turn on \"optimize storage\" in this step!  \n\n\n*Created a brand new empty Photos Library, called \"good library\".  \n\n\n*\n\n*Important:  This library MUST BE disconnected from iCloud at this point, i.e., is NOT the System Photos Library at this point.  Leave it that way for now, because if you connect this nice new library to iCloud at this point, you will end up with lots of duplicate photos on iCloud after step 3, which will then all show up on your phone and computer and screw everything up and you'll have to start over!  This is because the exported photos have different names than the old ones on iCloud and this confuses iCloud and it thinks they are new.  \n\n\n*Imported all my photos exported in step 1 into the new library.  Scanning resumed.  27,500 photos were scanned in four days at an average speed of 271 photos per hour.\n\n*Deleted all my photos from iCloud to avoid the duplicate photos problem I mentioned in step 2: \n\n\n*\n\n*Created a new empty Photos library on my Mac, called \"iCloud download.\" \n\n*I then turned on iCloud photos on my Mac and it's downloading all the photos to my Mac.  I have it set to \"optimize storage\" so it should be quicker than full resolution would be. \n\n*In the iCloud download library Select-All delete all photos then empty trash.  DONE (some stragglers undeleted still)\n\n*I then confirm on iCloud (https://www.icloud.com/) and on my phone that all are gone.  Again, this is critical to avoid duplicates!  \n\n\n*After confirming that step 4 has deleted all my photos on iCloud, I switch to my new good library and make it the system library.  Photos got uploaded and problems were all gone.  \n\n", "Q: Disable proximity sensor when locked If my phone is sitting on my desk locked, something like a napkin is just covering the proximity sensor, and I get a notification or something, the screen will not turn on.

I am in the process of transferring data from my old MacBook Pro to a new MacBook Pro. In order to transfer some files, I decided to plug in a USB hard drive that contained a bootable partition of my old MacBook Pro, as well as a partition that contained the files that I wished to transfer. (The drive contained a few partitions, all of which mounted on the new MacBook Pro).\nI had my old MacBook Pro for about four years, and I never performed a fresh install. So since the bootable partition on the usb drive is an exact copy of my old MacBook Pro hard drive, if there were any malicious files, they would be sitting on the hard drive.\nWhen I plugged in the hard drive to my new Mac, I did not open or run any files, I simply copied over a few specific files including some pictures that I took. I did not boot from the partition on the drive.\nMy understanding is that since macOS does not have autorun, I would have to actually copy infected files, or open or run an infected file (by clicking on it) in order to transfer or 'activate' malware or a virus, is this true?\nSo assuming that I did not copy or run any infected files from the hard drive, do I have anything to worry about? Is my new Mac at risk?

There are some videos telling how to install iOS 10 on iPhone 4s, for example How to get iOS 10 on iPhone 4/4s/5/5c/5s/6 and above. Though they contain the term iPhone 4s in the title, I am not sure whether it works, because that video doesn't clearly show installing iOS 10 on 4S device.\nThe software update in iPhone 4S doesn't show the iOS 10 update, but is there a way to install it? \n\nA: Officially Apple does not support iOS 10 on any iPhone model prior to the iPhone 5. In addition, the iPhone 4s hardware is just not capable of utilising many of the features of iOS 10.\nThis is not to say it wouldn't theoretically be possible to do so using non-standard means of installation, but the difficulties in doing so far outweigh any benefits of doing so. \nAlso, iOS 9.3.5 (13G36) is the last version of iOS that is officially supported on the iPhone 4s and many users complain that the phone struggles with this version of iOS. In fact, there was even a class action lawsuit against Apple claiming that iOS 9 should not have been installable on the iPhone 4s because the hardware struggles with it. One can only imagine how much more the hardware would struggle with iOS 10.\n\n[EDIT - A final note]\nIn my opinion the risk of an attempted installation of iOS 10 on an iPhone 4s is too great. While it works for some, it doesn't work for most - and for a small percentage it even makes the phone totally unusable (with reports of the phone no longer switching on or, if it does, messaging no longer working and/or it's incapable of being charged afterwards). \nUnfortunately, it isn't clear (at least to me) why it works for some and not others, and why it totally bricks the phone in some cases (although I suspect it may have something to do with what version of iPhone 4s is being used). \n\nA: You can't officially install IOS 10 on an iPhone 4s or below, but you can do what the guy in the video did or by jailbreaking your phone. The problem is it will probably brick your phone or, if not, make it really slow. If you want to get IOS 10 cheaply, your best bet is to buy an iPhone 5s or 5, which aren't too expensive right now!\n", "Q: New Apple TV screensavers not downloading I've read about and seen other people have new cities appear in the Aerial Apple TV screensaver. My Apple TV, and with the latest software, doesn't seem to ever show these. Has anyone else had this? I've also experienced a black screen when the screeensaver is meant to otherwise appear. \n\nA: It sounds like you need to change how often Apple TV downloads new vidoes from Never to Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. Open settings > general > screensaver > download new videos\n", "Q: Pair with a Bluetooth device over Terminal I am trying to connect and pair a Bluetooth device from the command line. I can do it over the GUI using the standard process but I am looking to automate the whole process. \nI am looking for commands that can be executed in a shell script to connect to the Bluetooth device. Just like Linux has \"hcitool\", \"pand\" commands, I am trying to find equivalent commands for macOS.\nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: blueutil (available via HomeBrew) is the answer. I just used it following the guidelines in this blog post.\nIn my case, I had an iMac with macOS Catalina that had no trackpad paired. I was stuck at the \"Send Apple Crash Analytics?\" screen with no keyboard controls. Using SSH, I connected to the machine and used the following commands to pair and then connect the trackpad without access to the GUI. (First, I had to turn the trackpad into Discoverable mode. The default PIN for Apple pointer devices is 0000.)\n% blueutil --inquiry\naddress: d0-a6-xx-xx-xx-xx, not connected, not favourite, not paired, name: \"-\", recent access date: -\n% blueutil --pair d0-a6-xx-xx-xx-xx\nType pin code (up to 16 characters) for \"Cheshire, Josh’s Trackpad\" (d0-a6-xx-xx-xx-xx) and press Enter: 0000\n% blueutil --connect d0-a6-xx-xx-xx-xx\n\nAt that point, the trackpad worked.\n\nA: The tool blueutil uses private APIs from the IOBluetooth framework to interact with bluetooth devices. You are able to list recent devices using:\nblueutil --recent\n\nand connect to a specific device using:\nblueutil --connect $device_adress\n\n\nA: This seems a little bit \"hacky\", but you can do this by using an oascript which emulates the GUI-interactions needed for connecting: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23018886/5269642\nI couldn't really find any documented API's for bluetooth unfortunately, the oascript-approach was the best I could find/think of so far.\n\nA: I'm using this:\nhttps://github.com/lapfelix/BluetoothConnector\nTL;DR\n$ brew install bluetoothconnector\n\n$ BluetoothConnector # gets the address of your connected devices\n\n$ BluetoothConnector 00-00-00-00-00-00 --notify # toggles the connection\n\nReplace the 00-00-00-00-00-00 with your MAC address\n", "Q: Special Character in Application Shortcut on Danish keyboard? My MacBook Pro has a Danish keyboard. \nThe character [ doesn't have its own key. I have to press ⌥+8 to get the left bracket character [.\nHow do you use a shortcut like ⌘+⌥+[?\n\nA: This doesn't directly answer your question, but if all you're trying to do is trigger a certain menu item with a keyboard shortcut, you can simply remap the shortcut in Keyboard preferences.\nGo to  > System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, click App Shortcuts in the left-hand list, and click the + icon at the bottom left corner. Type the name of the menu item you'd like to trigger and how widely accessible you want the shortcut to be (in one app or the whole system), and assign a shortcut which can be natively typed.\n\n", "Q: Does Apple maintain a public list of known serious bugs? Is there somewhere public that Apple (or a third party) maintains a list of known serious bugs with Apple's software?\nFor example it would have been nice to have known:\n\n\n*\n\n*That the reason that iCloud Calendar is silently failing to send any invitations to events I create is that for many users (for some years apparently) invitations for events with locations simply don't send.\n\n*That Apple Pay does not integrate with App Store accounts so that users are logged out of their App Store accounts when they pay with Apple Pay and are thus unable to track or change their order in any way.\n\n\nThese seem like things users would benefit from knowing. Is there somewhere that such issues are listed?\n\nNote that Apple Support is well aware of these issues, recommending, respectively, (1) that users should \"either not use locations or not send invitations\" and (2) \"not to use Apple Pay with the App Store\". But I had to contact support to get this information, only after much confusion and frustration with each bug.\n\nA: Apple does not have a list of publicly known issues/defects/etc. About the only option is to open a bug report with Apple through their Bug Tracking Tool. If the issue already exists in some manner, your opened issue will be closed and marked as duplicate, with the issue number for which yours is a duplicate. \nSadly and unfortunately, you will not be able to access the information of the \"original\" issue for which yours counts as a duplicate. Also, it has been said but has not been confirmed officially, that your reported issue will raise the internal priority of said \"original.\"\nNote that, this only helps if you know about the issue, to begin with, and report it. If you want to find out about any known/reported issues, the best option available at this time is to use OpenRadar. This site is publicly managed and populated voluntarily, by people who have opened issues with the bug reporting tool mentioned above, and added their information (issue tracking number, details, specifics, status, etc.) to the OpenRadar database.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 Car Bluetooth Issue with Incoming Phone Calls I have an iPhone 5 running iOS 10.2 and a 2015 Chevy Mailbu with Bluetooth capability for calls and streaming audio (non CarPlay).\nThe problem I have is when I am receiving calls (everything else works fine).  When a call comes in and I answer it, regardless if I press the phone button on the steering wheel or the answer button on the phone, the iPhone immediately switches to its internal speaker  I have to manually switch it back to the \"Bluetooth headset\" (car speakerphone) for the audio to work properly.\nI have tested this in 3 different cars - the Chevy, an Infiniti and a truck with an aftermarket Kenwood radio.  The problem is present in all three vehicles.  I have also tested with a Windows Phone and and Android phone and both phones work with the cars properly so it's definitely a phone issue.\nI have rebooted the iPhone, deleted the profile and re-paired with the radio and I have even reset the iPhone to factory default and re-paired it as if it was new.  The problem persists no matter what I do.\nDoes anyone know what the issue is or what I have to do to solve it?\n[Update]\nProblem still persists after iOS 10.3, didn't resolve the issue. \n\nA: I think this will fix it :\nSettings -> General -> Accessibility -> Scroll down to interaction section -> Call Audio Routing -> Choose headset\n", "Q: iMessage (iOS 10) doesn't index messages properly Here's the situation. I backed up an old iPhone 5S to iTunes on Windows via a  USB cable. I bought a new iPhone SE and restored the backup onto it. Everything works fine...except...no past messages show in Messages. The view, that usually shows them in reverse chronological order, is empty. Using the search widget doesn't find anything either. However, after creating a new message, that goes to one of the existing contacts, suddenly all the past messages appear in the chain!\nObviously the messages are on the device, but not indexed properly, probably a result of the backup and restore. Is there some way to re-index them so they'll show in the chronological view and be searchable via the search widget? Would another backup and restore help?\nSeems to be related to Weeks after updating to iOS 10.0.1, all but ~5 most recent messages disappeared, and messages would no longer organize by time and Old iMessages and text messages have all disappeared after iOS 10 update? neither of which got an answer.\n\nA: According to Apple's engineering department, backups only store the past 200 messages in the search database. The rest are stored for regular viewing, just not in the database.\n\"What the customer is experiencing is actually considered expected behavior.  With the release of iOS 10, customers are now only able to search the last 200 messages with Spotlight or the in-app search. This would include the last 200 sent and received messages.\nThe 200 searchable messages limit is only after restoring from a backup prior to iOS 10.  This is why devices that had the same Messages database and were not restored from a backup when they upgraded to iOS 10 can still search prior to the 200 limit.\nIf the customer would like to see this function in a different manner going forward, please encourage the customer to submit feedback at apple.com/feedback. “\n\nA: I wonder if we could use Spotlight indexing to force the Messages app to fix itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings app -> General -> Spotlight Search. Turn off Messages.\n\n*Reboot the iPhone.\n\n*(Don't open Messages yet.) Settings app -> General -> Spotlight Search. Turn back on Messages.\n\n*Wait one minute. Open Messages.\n\n\nIt's really a long-shot, but maybe having Spotlight read the database will force whatever goof is going on to un-goof. It's at least something to try while we continue to think.\n", "Q: iOS Safari Repeatedly Opens \"Virus Detected\" Emails On my iPad 2 (running iOS 9) there's a \"Virus Detected\" email popping up that I can neither delete or change. No matter what I do, the \"Virus Detected\" email keeps opening on my screen whenever I attempt to use Safari.\nI've attempted to delete the email, change the email and to close Safari but the email keeps returning and makes using the browser impossible.

This is a known vulnerability in iOS, fixed in iOS 10.2. \nTo fix the issue without updating your software, go to Settings -> Safari -> Clear Website and History Data. Alternatively, on an iPhone 6S (or newer) with 3D Touch, you can force-press on the Safari icon, open a New Tab, then immediately press down and hold the tab switcher icon, and hit Close All Tabs.\nLearn more about this issue.\nNote: This is fixed in iOS 10.2 (which, sadly, your iPad 2 can't update to), which prevents websites from opening mailto: links until the user specifically approves it.\n", "Q: Sum yearly totals automatically I am using a simple Numbers spreadsheet to track an expense that only comes up a few times per year.

Any pointers would be helpful.\n\nA: Once you have determined that it's not a homebrew problem using their troubleshooting guide my first suspicion would be that you are picking up the wrong version of the enum module. Make sure you are not setting PYTHONPATH anywhere (echo $PYTHONPATH at the command line will tell you) and try again.\nThe other possibility I would check is that you are running the right version of Python. which python should return /usr/bin/python (the version Apple installs), if not then you might want to check your PATH shell variable and temporarily set it to something else. \n", "Q: Which Apple TV generations support the use of AirPods? Does anyone know from experience whether AirPods work with the Apple TV 3rd generation?\n\nA: I have both 3rd and 4th gen. AirPods only work with 4th unfortunately \n\nA: I do not have personal experience with this, but I did some research.\nAccording to various reports from this thread on iMore, AirPods currently work fine with the Apple TV fourth generation (though they need to be paired with it like a standard Bluetooth device) but many people have reported that it does not work with the second- or third-generation Apple TV. A question and answer on the Apple store website also agree that it only works with the Apple TV 4 (and, presumably, versions to come).\n", "Q: I have the same number on 2 different phones with 2 different carriers I recently switched carriers and everything was done over the phone.

When I called back to activate the iPhone 6 I called from my old iPhone 4, which was registered with my old carrier. \nI expected as soon as the iPhone 6 was activated that the iPhone 4 with my old carrier would cut out, but it doesn't seem like this was the case. Now I have both phones connected to separate networks each using the same number and are fully functional. \nI didn't think this was possible, does anyone have an explanation? \n\nA: When porting a number from one provider to another, it may take a few hours for the old network/provider to complete the process. If the situation still exists after a full business day, give the old provider a call to sort it out. \n\nA: Based on your comment in answer to Patrix's question, it seems to me that your number has ported correctly across to your iPhone 6. This is why your iPhone 6 rings when someone calls your number, and why your iPhone 4 doesn't ring.\nHowever, as you haven't reset your iPhone 4 you may need to change the My Number field. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on Phone\n\n*Change the My Number field at the very top to the number it should be\n\n*Exit Settings\n\n\nIf you haven't got a new different number for the iPhone 4, you need to get one if you intend to still use it as a phone.\nHowever, you should reset the phone (especially if you're going to sell it).

When I fire up VLC and look on my Macbook, the image is clear and there is no stutering what so ever. It runs butter smooth. When I look at my TV, however, the quality is still very, very good, but the video stutters all the time. It's like a bungee/elastic effect when there's a panorama shot, and when there's a rolling shot going very fast, it's like watching 10 FPS clips.\nI can see my Macbook Pro uses the integrated 750M graphics card, and it does get quite hot.\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nA: I have a new 15 inch MacBook Pro. it has 4 thunderbolt ports on the sides. 2 on each side. no USB ports. so I bought an adapter for it. its  called a lention and has 4 different ports,3 usb an one lightening so I could plug my mouse in to it.i  began experiencing stuttering on my games and video. every 4 seconds it would stutter. my frame rates were going from 60fps to 30 fps and back an forth causing the stuttering.i unplugged it(the lention adapter) from my MacBook Pro an stuttering stopped!I went too the apple store an bought a different one(white one with just 1 USB port)an the stuttering has stopped completely.just wanted to share this in hopes it will help.\n", "Q: Multiple users developing for iOS simultaneously on a Mac using RealVNC We are a small team of developers and we would like to use MacBook Pro to develop for iOS.\nIs is possible for several users to log in remotely to the Mac using RealVNC and to work in multiple accounts simultaneously?\nSetup:\n\n\n*\n\n*We have two Windows machines in different geographical locations\n\n*One single MacBook Pro where one user works locally\nWhat we did:\n\n\n*\n\n*We installed RealVNC server on the Mac\n\n\nWhat is the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*When someone logs into RealVNC remotely he ends up in the same account as the local user.\n\n\nA: Simple solutions\nVirtual Machines\nYou can create OS X virtual machines and connect to them instead of the main session. Apps that can do this are for example: VMware, Virtualbox etc.\nVPN clients spawning sessions\nI do not know about Windows, but on OS X when you connect via Screen Sharing.app there is a possibility to create new session remotely. Maybe someone from the \"Windows world\" knows about that kind of software and can share knowledge about it.\nAdvanced solution\nIf You have a remote access app, which is able to connect also to the login window (the place where you choose the user and provide the password) - you can use a little hack:\nRun the process with those lines (can be done via SSH):\nCGSSessionID outSession = 1;\nCGSCreateLoginSessionWithDataAndVisibility(&outSession, NULL, false);\n\nThis has to be compiled to the executable - it's written using C language and private API (more info on stackoverflow).\nThis will create separate GUI session in the background - then connect to the server running on the login window and connect to this \"new\" session.\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest way is to use VirtualMachines.\n\n*One of the app, that I know which can log into login window is NoMachine ( I was a developer of this app couple years ago and multiple sessions on OS X were possible, but that was proof of concept. Maybe this works out of the box right now).\n\n*I do not know if this CGSCreateLoginSessionWithDataAndVisibility hack still works in the newest OS X (I made this on Yosemite).

Any other way to get more RAM? Is there anyway to ''borrow'' from my 1.5GB of VRAM to be used for my RAM? \nOtherwise, am I flat-out stuck with my 4GB of RAM? \nToo bad it's soldered down. :( \nThanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately, your question is based on a misunderstanding of how your particular MacBook Pro's VRAM works. \nBased on your question details, I assume you have a Late-2013 13\" Retina MBP. These models came with an on-board Intel Iris 5100 graphics card. This will actually use up to 1.5GB of your computer's 4GB RAM for its graphics processing. \nIn other words, the on-board Intel Iris 5100 graphics card does not actually have 1.5GB of VRAM that you could try to borrow as RAM.\nSince your RAM is soldered on, if you were to keep this computer then your best bet would be to try and reduce the amount of VRAM being borrowed from your computer's RAM. Whether this is even possible will depend on how you use your computer (e.g. if you have a 4K external display connected then it'll be using more of your RAM as VRAM, if you have no external displays and do nothing but check email all day then you're probably already using as little RAM as possible for your VRAM).\nThere is also the option of using an external graphics card connected via your Thunderbolt port, but to be honest this may not free up much of your RAM if not much of it was being used as VRAM to begin with. And with only 4GB RAM, I'd be looking at the option implied by Steve Chamber's comment (i.e. sell your MBP and buy another one with more RAM).\n", "Q: External mic not working anymore on Macbook Air I have a Macbook Air \"Early 2014\" with OS 10.11.6.\nA few months ago, I used a lavalier mic plugged into the headphone/mic jack of this Macbook Air.

Having just made the leap to Sierra (10.12.2), I've discovered that one of my favorite add-ons is behaving funkily, and wonder if any of you have discovered an alternative.\nI don't actually care that much about Growl itself, but Hardware Growler is a wonderful add-on to Growl that gives you all sorts of info about what's going on behind the scenes with the hardware you connect/disconnect from it. Everything from USB, Bluetooth & Firewire to Network, Power and Volume mounting/unmounting.\nSince it's primarily just reporting things that system doing & noticing, I would imagine there might be something like an Automator workflow, integrated with some command line tools that could replace it?\n\nI'm using version 2.1.3 of Growl, which is the latest, and what I was using in El Capitan. HardwareGrowler is at version 2.2, and again, that's what I have been using for quite some time.\n\nA: I just upgraded to High Sierra and version 2.1.3 which is the latest, and you get get it from the App store, download it or build it yourself from Github.  Works very well, I had to add it to the startup items.  Other than that, still works.\n\nA: I am not aware of a replacement for Hardware Growler, sadly (I use it a great deal, myself). What I will say, if you don't have a need for Growl itself anymore, except for Hardware Growler, the good news is that Hardware Growler is a standalone application that will send Notifications directly to Notification Center.\nI might try completely uninstalling both Growl and Hardware Growler, and reinstalling just HG.\n", "Q: How do I free up space (delete things) taken up by my iPad's Photo Library?

I clicked on my \"Camera\" icon and after clicking on its gallery, I clicked the \"Trash\" icon next to every item in there.  However, when I go into my Storage Settings, and drill down to my \"Photos & Camera\", it says \"8.9 GB,\" but there's no where that allows me to delete the items used by the storage.\nHow do I actually delete things?  That is, I'm trying to free up storage, which I can't seem to do.\n\nA: On the newer iOS versions, Apple initiated a delayed trash. This means that things are only truly deleted after they've been in the trash for 30 days.\nTo force things to delete, go to the photos app, then choose albums in the bottom right corner. Scroll down until you find the \"recently deleted\" album and click on it.

Is there any way to play music through all of the speakers in a 5.1 (or 7.1) surround system in Sierra? I've looked at options like Soundflower, but everything I've looked into is 3+ years old.\nTo clarify:\nI'm looking for a way to play 2.1 sound out of all speakers on a 5.1 surround sound system. I have already configured my 5.1 speakers properly, I do not need help with that. For Windows, there is a handy program called Speaker Fill, but it is not available for Mac.\nBelow are screenshots of my audio configuration. The 5.1 surround it connected via a USB Sound Card. I have verified that all 5 speakers are connected to the correct channels via the test in MIDI Setup.\n\n\n\nA: Yes, you can do what you want with Vox Music Player and maybe also Jack OS X.\nIn terms of which option you'd be better using, it really gets down to what you want to do? If you just want to be able to play music, Vox Music Player is the easier option (it's confirmed as macOS Sierra compatible).\nHowever, if you want to use all your speakers for other uses and/or want the ability to control which applications do and don't use your speakers, then Jack OS X provides more flexibility in that regard (however I have not used it with macOS Sierra - it does, however, do what you want on earlier systems).\nUnless something has changed, both options are free to download.\nIf you do want to try using the Jack OS X option, use the instructions below. \nINSTRUCTIONS FOR JACK OS X\nI have not tested these steps in macOS Sierra, so please be sure to report back with how you go as it may help others.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Jack OS X (be sure to download the appropriate version)\n\n*Install Jack (Note: To be able to actually install the software, you may need to manually go to the download and press the Control key while clicking on the app icon and then choose Open from the shortcut menu. Then, when the message appears, click on Open.)\n\n*After installation, reboot your Mac\n\n*Open JackPilot from within the Jack folder (This should be located in your Applications folder)\n\n*In Preferences set the Interface to match how it is your speakers are connected (e.g. USB sound card)\n\n*Ensure that both the virtual inputs and outputs match the Interface you selected at Step 4\n\n*Now go back to Finder and launch the Audio MIDI Setup app (This should be located in your Applications/Utilities folder)\n\n*Select the properties for JackRouter (Note: If you don’t see JackRouter, make sure you have Started it in Jack)\n\n*Click on Configure Speakers…\n\n*Set your speaker outputs by using the drop-downs to set the output for each speaker. (Note: You can click the speaker name to do a sound test for that speaker). \n\n*Click on Done\n\n*Open iTunes and play some music\n\n*Go to JackPilot and click on Start\n\n*Click on Routing (may take a little while to appear)\n\n*Choose iTunes by pressing the drop-down arrow\n\n*You should see some outputs labelled as out1, out2 etc. Choose out1.\n\n*In the second column, use the drop-down arrow for System and double-click on the option that applies to you (e.g. double-click on playback_2,3,6 (where 2 and 6 represent side speakers, 3 represents a subwoofer)\n\n*For out2 choose the remaining playbacks.

A lot can be done and re-configured with HALLab and AULab, on the other hand 10$ is fair enough for loopback, it's works well (with some UX weirdness)- but if you dont want to spend x hours- fiddling go for it. HAL/AUL can make the user angry if you dont know it.\nHow to config Spotify 2.0 to 5.1 for USB: \n\n\n\n\nFor super extra config powers you need:\nApple's HLLab and AULab\n\n\nBoth applications are available from https://developer.apple.com, \nif you are already logged in, you can grab them from here directly\nThe dmg file is available as download for all accounts, after log-in with your apple id (works for non-developer subscriptions as well)\nHALLab gives you a lot of configuration options and, for example, check the Streams tab, (after selecting Info)- you can tune the frequency upwards, and change your channel layout :)\n\n\nAudio Units Lab allows even more you can build your dts mixers and add/remove them in whatever configuration you like:\n\nIf you spend some time with those 2 utils you will be initially very angry, but after finding out how all of it sticks together you probably uninstall loopback before the trial is over. You need some time to read and check configs- there is a lot.\nI don't have enough desktop room to add to show more, but you can do a \nlot with filters, enough for days to fiddle with your audio.

I will be using the Mac at the time, then suddenly the screen shuts down black as if its gone to sleep (nothing that I've done knowingly has triggered this). There is nothing that I can do to then turn on the Mac - Power button does nothing and pressing the touchpad also does nothing. I have to close the lid and then open it again to wake it up.\nWhen I then open up the Mac, it will stay awake and then repeat the above over and over, only staying awake for 5 - 15 seconds at a time before sleeping again.\nI have run:\n    pmset -g log\n\n.. and i get (amongst all other lines)\n    Entering DarkWake state due to 'Clamshell Sleep': Using AC (Charge:100%) \n\nFrom all my Googling, this seems to indicate that the lid has been shut, but the lid is still open.\nAny hints on how I can stop this from happening?\nALSO: This is the 2nd MacBook Pro this has happened to, so seems to be a user profile or software thing over a hardware thing. This issue has followed me moving from one machine to another with a Time Machine backup...\n\nA: I don't know if this might be pertinent to your situation, but I once had a very similar problem with a 2009 MBP. The weird thing was when I picked it up and moved it, it would wake up. This went on for weeks until I finally figured it out; it would sometimes fall asleep when I put it on top of a (closed) white MacBook. It turns out both the MB and MBP sense the lid is closed via a magnet in the lid and a magnetic sensor near the front of the machine. When I laid it on top of the MB the MB's magnet triggered the sensor in the MBP making it think the lid was closed. So, it might be worth noticing if you've got any strongish magnets in the area around the front of the machine when it spontaneously takes a nap.\n\nA: My first instinct would be to reset both the NVRAM and SMC. Try the following and let us know how you go.\nReset the SMC\nFor your particular MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nReset your NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Either way, here’s how to reset this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\n\nA: I had another problem that was strangely solved by @Felix answer\nMy MBP 13\" 2019 wouldn't wake after opening lid on Catalina / Big Sur with\nSleep wake failure in EFI 0xFFFFFFFF0000001F\n\nI tried all suggested workarounds, e.g.\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\nI found that the magnet from my new laptop case caused this issue as I always placed MPB on top of the case or carried MBP in it\nI found it after checking pmset -g log.

The integrated dictation software on my Mac (whose hotkey is pressing function twice) takes 10 seconds to initialize after not using it for around 10 minutes. It's a minor nuisance, but still a nuisance. Is there documentation for changing the settings?\nMacBook OS 10.11\n\nA: By default, Enhanced Dictation waits 7 minutes (420 seconds) before quitting its processes. You can override this default by writing a different value to its preference file.\nFor example, if you want Dictation to wait 60 minutes (3600 seconds), open Terminal and execute the following command.\ndefaults write com.apple.inputmethod.ironwood DelaySecondsUntilTerminatationOffline -float 3600;killall DictationIM\n\nIf you want to return to the default value, you can remove the override using the command:\ndefaults remove com.apple.inputmethod.ironwood DelaySecondsUntilTerminatationOffline;killall DictationIM\n\n", "Q: What does it mean for `cp -a` to \"not [preserve] directory structure\"?

Preserves structure and attributes of files but not directory structure.\n\nFreeBSD cp's manual does not have this caveat, although the structure of the options remains very similar, if not identical.\nWhat does not preserving directory structure mean in this case?\n\nA: It means that if you copy into an existing directory it will not delete existing files and subdirectories (and existing subdirectories will have their existing permissions and ownership information, even if there is a directory of the same name in the source copy). This is equivalent to the \"merge\" option when copying a folder in the Finder, and there is no equivalent to the replace option.\n", "Q: What is the recommended headphone hardware spec to pair with Apple Watch Series 2?

I'm in desperate need of help to recover all my files.\n\nA: There is a product called DiskDrill that I have used with good success.  You can use the product for free to see what it can find.  To actually recover your files, you will need to purchase a license.  \nThe key to a successful recovery is to immediately stop modifying the drive.  You either need to get a new drive and connect your original drive via USB, or boot from external (USB) drive and run the recovery utility.  The more you modify your drive, the less chance of recovery.\nMy suggestion is now is a good time to get a new SSD and convert that older drive into an external USB so you can create an image (through DiskDrill) of the drive for recovery and then when you are done, set it up as a time machine back up.  A USB to SATA adapter can be had for less than $15 so this is a very cheap option.\n\nA: Another alternative to the awesome TestDisk is GetDataBack, it's a paid software, but I used it successfully on hard drives that TestDisk could not recover. You can try the demo to see if the files are recovered, then buy the software to recover the files.\nThe additional killing feature compared to TestDisk is that it can read and understand the OS filesystem from parts to parts, whereas TestDisk needs the whole partition to be recoverable to recover your disk (or they provide PhotoRec for data scraping, but you lose all directory trees and metadata like filenames! Whereas GetDataBack can recover a directory tree even if the rest of the hard disk is corrupted).\nAnother one that had close results to GetDataBack but with some redundancy and GUI bugs was Easus DataRecovery Wizard Pro (it can also understand partial filesystems). Finally, you can also try Alsoft Diskwarrior for Mac, seems similar featurewise but never tried it.\n\nA: You can also try using Secure Data Recovery Services or a similar data recovery service.  You will have to send in your drive or your MacBook to them for service.\n\nA: Do you have a Time Machine backup? If yes, you can recover your data from it.  If not, why not!? Depending on how important your data is to you, you might want to consider a professional recovery service via Kroll Ontrack Date Recovery Service.\nThey also have do it yourself Data Recovery Software.\nI'm not directly affiliated with Kroll Ontrack, just a satisfied customer of both the Recovery Service and Recovery Software I've used myself.\n\nA: I just spent the weekend using testdisk and photorec on a dying external drive for a friend.\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nTestdisk itself is for a drive that is mostly recognizable (your case I think).  photorec is for desperate circumstances.  Neither will work if you actually wrote zero's across the drive as opposed to an accidental reformat, which doesn't actually wipe the drive.\nTestdisk tries to read the underlying filesystems, whereas photorec just blindly looks across the disk for file headers that it recognizes, and then it assumes the file is contiguous.\nIn your case, I would give testdisk a shot first.  You can either download it for MacOS, or use a rescue cd: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Livecd\n", "Q: How do I sort photos by date taken in Apple Photos?

For every non-English user, this switch is frequent.\nTo make it easier, I want to use Tab to switch input sources. \nFollowing this, a ⇧Tab sounds like a good idea to perform the normal function of Tab. \nHowever, System Preferences (as I tried it) only allows the user to set the switch as a combination starting with ⇧ Shift or ⌃ Control. \nIs my request unreasonable? Or can it be done?\n\nA: Oh, I found Karabiner Elements works for Sierra, and I am very satisfied now. \nPreviously, Karabiner is out of order in Sierra. \nIndeed, Sierra starts to offer custom remaps among those of ⇪Caps Lock, ^Control, ⌥Option, and ⌘Command, with System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier keys. \nStill, I cannot use any of them to switch input source with System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources. \nThere has been several months, and today I visited Karabiner's homepage again. \nThey say they produced a Karabiner Elements for Sierra, but I cannot compile myself, though had not closely studied the error message. \nBesides, fortunately there is a latest compiled image. \nThe link is not anywhere obvious on their homepage, but I found it in another forum discussion, so I hope more people seeing this (my post) can find this image. \nKarabiner Elements works fine, as far as I see, for simple assignment of keys — i.e. to force the physical key X's signal to be interpreted as key Y's function. \nThis is my setting. \nPhysical ⇪Caps Lock now performs the function of Esc, \nand Esc that of `, \nand ` that of ↹Tab , \nand ↹ Tab that of F4 (or something else), \nand F4 that of ⇪Caps Lock. \nThen I set F4 to switch to the previously-used input source. \nI am proud of my setting.

How can I set this up to allow access from within the rest of my home network, using that address? \n\nA: You cannot with just ordinary TCP/IP let other computers access your web site on the Mac Pro using the IP address 127.0.0.1. This address has a special meaning in the IP protocol, and always refers to the local computer - never other computers.\nIf you really want to do so, you'll need to use port forwarding. You can use SSH to port forward the remote port 80 to the local port 80, and thus be able to access the remote AMPPS web site using the 127.0.0.1 address.\nHowever, there's really no point in doing so. It won't make it faster, better or anything else. As you write no reason for wanting 127.0.0.1 specifically, it seems you're better off using an ordinary RFC1918 IP network on your home network - such as for example 10.x.y.z/8 or 192.168.x.y/16.\n\nA: 127.0.0.1 is the IP address that is assigned to your loopback interface.  The general definition of \"loopback\" is as follows:\n\nLoopback, or loop-back, refers to the routing of electronic signals,\n  digital data streams, or flows of items back to their source without\n  intentional processing or modification. This is primarily a means of\n  testing the transmission or transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe hostname localhost, maps back to the loopback address.\nSo, in sort the loopback address goes nowhere but \"loops back\" to the originating host.  This is how you can install and test a web service or database service, etc. without ever being connected to a network.\nFor other computers to access your services, you need to use the IP address on your LAN.  This is usually eth0 if you are wired.\n# ifconfig -a\n\nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n        options=10b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV>\n        ether a8:20:66:39:2c:1c \n        inet6 fe80::aa20:66ff:fe39:2c1c%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4 \n        inet 192.168.1.100 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255\n\nSo, for my Mac, my IP address is 192.168.1.100.  If you issue the same command, you should be able to find your particular address.  That's the address you need to use to access your computer.\n", "Q: Make wifi TX rate in menu bar instead of wifi icon Is it possible to make the wifi icon in the menu bar the TX rate or the wifi speed rate?

You can set it so your phone won’t ring or buzz when you receive phone calls, new text messages, new email, or new invitations from annoying “friends” who want to challenge you to a game of Candy Crush or whatever.\nCertain notifications get through no matter what, such as timers and alarms set through the Clock app. You may still receive various government alerts too, such as emergency alerts and AMBER alerts.\n\nContinue to the source article for more detailed info on customizing DND to get the most from the feature.\n", "Q: Will the new 13 inch Macbook Pro handle running macOS and Windows in a VM simultaneously? I'm planning on buying a new Macbook Pro (13 inch) as my primary work computer. I do a lot of .NET development, so I will have to have Windows running in a VM inside macOS (Parallels). \nI'm currently considering the 2Ghz dual core i5 processor, 8gb RAM and 512gb SSD. \nWill I be able to run Windows 10 within Parallels and still get a smooth experience? I will mostly be using Visual Studio (possibly two or more instances). \nMy biggest concern is regarding the 8 gigabytes of RAM - will that be insufficient?\nDoes anybody here use a similar setup and could provide some information on whether it would work just fine or if I should get 16gb of RAM? Because of tax laws in my country, there is a cap on how much the company is willing to let me spend on a computer. Basically I have to choose between \n\n\n*\n\n*256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM\n\n*512 GB SSD and 8GB of RAM\n\n\n256GB SSD will almost definitely not be enough, so I feel that I have no choice but to prioritise that. If I add both a 512gb ssd and 16gb of RAM, it will exceed the amount I'm allowed to spend. \n\nA: Yes, you can run macOS as well as Windows in VM on that computer and get a reasonably smooth experience.\nRemember that \"smooth\" is subjective. If you're compiling the odd C# desktop app, using the debugger, etc. - that's going to work fine.\nIf you want to run a heavy stack with all sorts of services (SQL Servers, logging platforms, indexing systems, etc.) and have a huge project with many subcomponents - the ride isn't going to be as smooth.\nThe worst case scenario with 8 GB of RAM is that you're going to be using a lot of swap space. It will slow things down - but not as bad as on an old computer, as the SSD on the new MacBook Pro is quite fast.\nI would recommend booting up your current development environment and check the memory usage. That would give you a good indication of whether to prioritise disk or RAM.\n", "Q: How is iMessage/FaceTime/iCloud service in China? A non-tech savvy friend is going to China. I need to stay in contact with him while he's there. I've set up WeChat to ensure we're not stalled by firewalls, but I'd really like to use iMessage and FaceTime there. How do iMessage and FaceTime work in China? What about iCloud File Sharing?\n\nA: Although China is notorious for restricting various internet services, iMessage, FaceTime, and iCloud are not among them.\nYour friend would have no trouble using these services, as long as he's either connected to Wi-Fi or has a cellular connection.\n\nA: I was in Shanghai recently (1/1/17). iMessage worked with no problems. I did not try FaceTime.\n\nA: Been in Shanghai for more than 3 months. Facetime, iCloud and iMessage work perfectly well. \nAnd speaking for Shanghai, Apple Maps is surprisingly good. Works beautifully even for Transit.\n\nA: On devices bought in China only FaceTime Audio is disabled, while FaceTime Video is available.\n\nA: Not working!\n\nThis is from Europe calling to China in March, 2021. (A daughter would like to facetime her isolated mom during Covid19 :-(\nNeither Facetime(Audio & Video) and iMessage. If you click on the person's name on macOS or ios device, all of these icons are greyed out or linked to normal CN phone No.(i.e. international call)\nPS: the recipient is registered at EU iCloud server, not Chinese iCloud controlled by CN gov.\nThis restriction is called CN Great Firewall(GFW), sometimes it would open slightly/partly/shortly if they want to confuse you, that's why sometimes for some people may work but others not, and from region to region in China.On the other side, CN only allow WeChat( a CN copy of iMessage/Facetime) to use in mainland, would like to propagate to US/EU and the world, where big data & AI in its full control.\n", "Q: How can you tell what time a photo sent via iMessage was taken? If a picture is iMessaged to me, how can I tell what time that photo was taken? When I save it, it changes the EXIF info to the time I save it (which isn't helpful). I am trying to see if a stranger is lying to me, for my safety. \n\nA: You can figure out what date & time an image was taken1 (and the GPS coordinates of where it was taken2) by saving the image to your camera roll, opening this online metadata viewer, and loading the photo into that tool.\n1 This can be manually modified with a metadata editor or be made incorrect by setting the device time to something that isn't the current time.\n\n2 As long as the Location permission was granted by the photographer in their Camera app, and the metadata wasn't manually scrubbed of this (note that it can be made incorrect by a metadata editor too).\n\nHere's a sample result:\n\n\nA: Can't guarantee this but it's worth a try.  Save the photo, then import to Mac with GraphicConverter or iPhoto or Photos.app. Or if on Windows, maybe iTunes has a way to get it there.\nI guess you could mail it to yourself on another platform.  If in Photos, select it and export original. Then use 'exiftool' to dump ALL the tags.  There will be lots of dates.  If there is GPS data, the GPS Date will probably be good.  If not, look at all the other dates and the earliest one is probably good.\nUnfortunately, it is possible to change any of the dates, but this is your best chance.\nP.S. There is a version of exiftool embedded in GraphicConverter but it's easier to read in Terrminal.\n\nA: If you have a Mac computer, there's an option (works for me at least).\nThe sequence of actions which lets me figure the time a shot was taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Messages app\n\n*Choose your dialog, right-click the image and choose \"Open\"\n\n*CMD+I. The creation date is exactly the time the photo was shot.\n\n\nA: I've used the Photo Investigator iPhone app for that purpose. It's free to use, but you have to pay to remove ads and to actually edit the metadata.\nYou can add it as an action too, so it's easy to \"send\" a photo to the app right from iMessages.\n", "Q: How to make KEXT files open with Finder I frequently edit files inside of kernel extension (.KEXT) files on OS X.  To do this, I have to right-click and \"Show Package Contents\".  To save time, I would like to simply double-click the package and have it open with Finder.\nIdeally, Finder would show the full folder hierarchy in column view.  Currently, when I show the package contents, the folder hierarchy is \"reset\" with the package as root.  As you can see in this screenshot, there is no horizontal scrollbar, so I can't quickly traverse up the hierarchy as I could in a normal directory tree.  I'm working in Sierra, but this question could apply to any recent version of OS X.\n\n\nA: Create an Automator Service using the setting in the image below.\n\nThen assign it a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nI assigned it: optioncommandK\nCode for Run Shell Script:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    fn=\"$(basename \"$f\")\"\n    ext=\"${fn##*.}\"\n    if [[ $ext == kext ]]; then\n        open \"$f/Contents\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, there is no way to make packages simply behave like regular folders in macOS. However, to make your life a bit easier, you may want to take a look at this similar question — there you can find instructions for adding a keyboard shortcut to Show Package Contents, and if you're willing to do a bit more work, creating an Automator action to determine which to do automatically.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra doesn't have the crispy fonts as they used to be in earlier versions First, running the following command:\ndefaults -currentHost read -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing\n\ngives me back 3.\nBut the fonts nowhere look the way they used to look in earlier versions of macOS. I was using Yosemite before, and today I upgraded to Sierra. Below is the screenshot of Sublime Text editor.\n\nThey look OK in iTerm, but elsewhere - including browsers - font rendering is much worse.\nSo how can I make these fonts as crispy as they used to on earlier macOS/OS X versions? I guess it definitely has something to do with AppleFontSmoothing, or font anti-aliasing in general, but I have tried the many other options in this regard, that are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting AppleFontSmoothing with and without currentHost flag, and restarting the macbook each time I make a change to see the changes.\n\n*Ran the command sudo atsutil databases -remove to remove all the user installed fonts.\n\n*Re-installing the font that I was using to get the desired result. (Note: I was using \"Bitstream Vera Sans Mono\")\n\n*Tried to change font smoothing option for specific applications like com.apple.terminal but it didn't work either.\n\n\nNote: a similar question.\n\nA: Tried clearing the Font caches?

I've been using my early 2014 MBA in clamshell mode connected to an LG Flatron monitor via VGA with no issue. I recently started using HDMI (using this Amazon Basics dongle). I used this with no issue at my folks' house with no issue over the holidays but now back home I'm getting lots of connectivity issues. Here's the rundown:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDMI Clamshell: Lots of connectivity issues. Web browsing is nigh undoable\n\n*HDMI Dual Screen: The connection gets better when I open the laptop but is still spotty to the point of frustration\n\n*VGA Clamshell: Some connectivity issues but not horrific\n\n*VGA Dual Screen: No connectivity issues\n\n*No External Monitor: No connectivity issues\n\n\nWhat could be causing these issues? Is it Comcast sucking? Does the laptop being closed block radio waves? I don't know much about wireless networks. I would appreciate some help in troubleshooting this.\n\nA: It's not so much there's an issue with WiFi while in clam shell mode, is where the laptop is positioned while in clam shell mode.\nThe WiFi antenna is located in the display assembly itself, so when it's open, you are in effect \"raising the antenna.\"  When closed, you are \"lowering the antenna\" to a flat position which will affect reception.\n\nThere is a possibility that a poorly shielded HDMI cable/adapter will cause WiFi interference.  However, given that you experience the problem while in clam shell mode is indicative of placement.\nConsider getting a \"[vertical dock][2]\" for your MBA so that the antenna is \"raised.\"\n", "Q: iPhone Dies with 80% Battery Remaining My iPhone 5 runs out of power very quickly. First it was 50%. Then it was 60%, then 70%, and now 80%. At 80%, the phone will shut down like it would when the power gets to 0%. When it powers back on, it says 80%. It's almost like the limit of when to shut the phone off was, and still is getting to a higher percentage. \nHowever, the phone is unusable. Not only does it run out of power quickly, it also drains power at a ridiculous rate. In half an hour, with wifi enabled and the screen off, it takes about half an hour to turn off. When I'm using it, it takes 10-15 minutes after a full charge to die. What's the cause of this issue, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: While the iPhone 6s has a service plan - reduced cost replacement1 for having an issue where the battery reaches an end-of-life state after around a year of use (causing the battery to die at ~30%), older iPhones normally reach this state when their batteries grow old and tired (lithium-ion batteries can only be recharged so many times before they become unable to hold most of the original charge). Your iPhone 5 has a 3-3.5-year-old battery2, and thus it's the battery's fault that the phone is dying so quickly.\nThe only fix is to replace your iPhone's battery, something you can safely attempt yourself following this video or bring your phone to the Apple Store to have them do it (cost is usually 80-100 dollars without AppleCare).\n1 The battery malfunctions are blamed on a manufacturer leaving the batteries exposed to ambient air too long; note that it is not a safety issue, merely a convenience issue. Recall information here.\n2 Based on a release date of September 2014.\ntl;dr: It's the old battery's fault, bring it to an Apple Store and get them to replace the battery to fix the issue.\n", "Q: How do I find password-protected PDFs on my hard disc? I'm trying to find password-protected PDFs, using Spotlight (though answers involving a third-party app are also fine). Spotlight has a Security field that describes the \"Encryption method used to make the document secure\":\n\nWhen I select this, I have to enter something for it to match:\n\nWhat should I enter to match password-protected PDFs?\n\nA: The security attribute of an item is stored as the object kMDItemSecurityMethod in the spotlight database.\nThis is usually a string. Until now I have found \"none\" and \"Password encrypted\" as possible strings. This doesn't mean necessarily that the file needs a password to be opened.

How do I tell how power is moving through my MacBook Pro's USB-C ports? My shiny new MacBook Pro (15\", 2016), comes with four USB-C ports.\nSometimes power comes in through one of these ports, as when I charge the machine from Apple's included official 87 W power adapter, or another power adapter. Sometimes power goes out through these ports, as when I use them to power my iPhone or an external accessory like a hard drive.\nDoes macOS provide any tool that can tell me the net flow of power through every one of these ports? Or is there a third-party application which can do so? The benefit of this is it would let me manage my battery better, and also understand if cables, hubs, and power adapters are performing as intended.\nThe closest thing I can find is to go About This Mac / Overview / System Report / USB, where I see three fields: Current Available, Current Required, and Extra Operating Current. I don't quite understand what these fields mean. Also, they purport to describe current (in milliamps), rather than power (in watts). Without knowing the voltage I cannot know the flow of power, and my understanding is that voltage does indeed vary on USB-C power circuits.\n\nA: Find at this article for more details regarding USB-C in MacBook.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204360\n", "Q: My Safari download button has disappeared For some odd reason, I am unable to witness my download button, even when i am downloading something.

Up until recently, controlling Logic Pro X with the iPad was working perfectly fine, but since a couple of weeks ago (might have been related to an update of either Logic Pro X, or Logic Remote), the mixing controls on the iPad are no longer working.\nWhen I try to change a track's volume on the iPad, nothing happens in Logic Pro X, instead, the track's volume slider on the iPad drops down to zero and can't be moved anymore. This happens with all tracks in all of my Logic Pro X projects.

Instead, I'm printing through the web-interface of the printer, and I'm wondering if there's a way to automize this.\nThe steps I do manually that I want to automize (all or some):\n\n\n*\n\n*Save document as .ps (works better than .pdf for this printer)\n\n*Go to the web address and log in to the printer\n\n*Drag the file I want to the browser UI\n\n\nWriting a script to simulate the web login and transmission of the file is a separate problem which I think I can solve. \nMy question: Can I use this custom script (probably Pyhton) as a \"printer driver\" to make it show up in the list of printers and enable me to print using cmd-p? It would have to automatically save as .ps and then do the webb stuff.\n\nA: You don't need to create a \"driver\" as the functionality you need is already available.  From the normal Print (CMD+P) dialog window, in the lower left corner, click on the PDF drop-down menu and choose the Save as PostScript option to save the \"print\" as a .ps file. (This part may have been your step #1 but I wasn't sure how you were saving the page as .ps)\n\nUsing a macro/script utility like Hazel, Keyboard Maestro, Automator, etc., they could be configured to monitor a specific folder where you save the .ps file.  When a new file appears, the macro/script could trigger to send the file to the printer.\nAlso, depending on the printer model, it is likely the script could send the .ps file directly to the printer using a port/interface designed for a script/stream instead of using the web GUI.  IPP/LPD/socket interfaces are designed for exactly this.  Most likely the web GUI is using a javascript to grab the file from you then pass it into one of these interfaces.\nP.S. Notice that in the screenshot, the \"Save as PDF\" option has a CMD+S shortcut.  I created that by using the Keyboard Preference Pane in System Preferences.  If you want to do the same but for the \"Save as PostScript\" option... Open the Keyboard Preference, switch to Shortcuts, select App Shortcuts on the left then click the [+] icon below.  Set the shortcut for All Applications, Menu Title of \"Save as PostScript...\", and the Shortcut as CMD+S.  You can use CMD+S because the normal shortcut for CMD+S (File>Save) is not available when the Print dialog is shown.  Another good shortcut is CMD+P for the same reason.  That way you press CMD+P, wait a second for the dialog to appear, then press CMD+P again.\n", "Q: How my iMac turned off I was working, then I received a phone call and left my iMac for a while. macOS Sierra is actually running.\nI came back about 30 minutes later and found my Mac was turned off.\nSince there are no phantoms at home, I thought I forgot I turned it off, maybe absentmindedly (I'm quite sure I didn't, anyway).\nThe question is: is there any way to check HOW the iMac turned off?

It happily accepts all line ending types (even intermixed within the same file) and displays them properly.\nYou would probably need to use a text editor where you have direct control over the line endings and text encoding type when saving the file.  BBEdit is a great text editor that has such controls.\nAnother option is to convert the file with a utility like dos2unix.  The website doesn't offer a macOS binary download so you would need to either compile it yourself or install a package manager like Homebrew first then install the dos2unix package with brew install dos2unix.

It could potentially be one component of a jailbreak, but it would need to be combined with a number of other important components (e.g, kernel patches to disable code signature checks and sandboxing) to allow it to be used as one.\n\n… or is the whole NAND encrypted while the device is locked?\n\nIt's complicated. All storage on iOS devices is encrypted. However, some of this data is encrypted using only a key that's embedded into the processor (the device UID), making it accessible at all times; other data is encrypted using a key that is wrapped using the device's passcode, making it only available when the device is unlocked.\nSome details on this system are available in Apple's iOS Security Guide. But the TL;DR is that most of the important data is inaccessible until the device is unlocked.\n\nA: From an interesting article about iOS security:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Since the iPhone 3GS, all iOS devices have used a hardware-based AES full-disk encryption that prevents storage from being moved from\n  one device to another, and facilitates a fast wipe of the disk.\n  \n*Since iOS 4 (iPhone 4), additional protections have been available using the Data Protection API (DPAPI).\n  \n*The DPAPI allows files to be flagged such that they are always encrypted when the device is locked, or encrypted after reboot (but\n  not encrypted after the user enters their passcode once).\n  \n*Once a user locks a device with a passcode, the class keys for “complete” encryption are wiped from memory, and so that data is unreadable, even when booting from a trusted external image.\n  \n*Once a user reboots a device, the “complete until first\n  authentication” keys are lost from memory, and any files under that\n  \n*DPAPI protection level will be unreadable even when booted from an\n  external image. Under iOS 8, many built-in applications received the\n  “complete until first authentication” protection.\n  \n\n", "Q: Automating document creation in Pages So my actual question is broader but I'll focus on a specific example to start:\nI created a Pages document with some sample text displayed in each of the available fonts for comparison.

It starts booting and the progress bar under the Apple logo goes to just under halfway before it turns off. Booting into recovery mode and trying to reinstall El Capitan doesn't work because it says the hard disk is locked. I tried running the chflags 0 and chmod to unlock it that are suggested around here from both single user mode and the recovery terminal but to no avail.\nThe files on the hard drive are all still there, so I tried to use cp to copy some stuff from there to USB disk, but it consistently crashes midway through the copy and goes to the \"your computer has had a problem\" screen. I've also tried zapping the PRAM.\nRunning first aid on Disk Utility from recovery mode says \"file system verify or repair failed\". I also tried booting in verbose mode and noticed it crashes after running fsck_hfs and fails, which I assume is what disk utility is doing behind the scenes.\nAny advice on how to backup and then do a clean install or reinstall from recovery or just fix it would be very appreciated!\n\nA: The symptoms you describe are indicative of a disk drive corruption.  It could be  physical (hardware) or just a file system corruption.\nRecovery will require booting from a different drive so you can copy files over.  You can boot from an external USB that has a clean install of OS X (El Capitan would be the latest as your system is not capable of running Sierra) or replace the internal drive with an SSD and attempt recovery via USB.\nPersonally, I prefer the latter.\nThe full repair guide is available on ifixit.com, but here are the basic steps you need to go through\nYou will need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*New SSD Drive.  I recommend the Samsung EVO series\n\n*USB to 3.5\" SATA adapter.  This is so you can access the drive for recovery\n\n*El Captian Installation Media. Note that this vintage iMac (2009 through Late 2011) will support up to High Sierra - 10.13.x\n\n*Suction Cups (for glass removal)\n\n*Torx T10 screwdriver\n\n*plastic spudger for connector removal\n\n*2.5\" to 3.5\" kit so the new drive will fit\n\n*External HDD for Time Machine (Optional, but highly, highly recommended)\n\n\nRemove the glass.  The good news is that the glass panel is held in with magnets which you can remove with suction cups and the LCD itself is held in with 10 Torx screws.\n\n\nReplace the drive. Once you have the panel removed, you will get access to the 3.5\" Hard Drive (see pic below)\n\nWhen you replace the drive, ensure that you replace the temperature sensor, otherwise you will end up with a fan that spins uncontrollably, and erroneous temperature readings.\nJust reverse the steps to re-assemble your iMac.\nClean Install OS X. Using the boot media, do a clean installation of OS X.  Then reinstall your apps.\nBegin recovery.  Using the USB to SATA adapter, hook up your old hard drive to your iMac via USB.  You should be able to mount it and cp (copy) your data off.  Once done, you can discard your drive (it's quite old and I wouldn't trust it for data storage anymore).  Take it to your local electronics recycler or sell it \"as is, for parts only\" on eBay; many recovery shops will take it for the PCB or server motors.  You won't get much, but it keeps it out of a landfill.\nSet up Time Machine.  I can't stress this enough... having a backup besides (or in addition to) iCloud is extremely important.  Right now, you are finding out first hand how valuable a Time Machine backup can be.\n\nA: That was the exact problem that I faced! Most likely it is a file system corruption that can only be fix via a clean install of the OS.\n1. Backup all important files and folders \nYou can use terminal to selectively backup files from your mac, especially the files and folders in your Home folder.\ncp -r -v /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/user-name/ /Volumes/Backup\nThis is the command, where /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/user-name is the source and /Volumes/Backup is the destination. The parameter -r means to copy recursively including the files inside each subdirectory. -v is to enable verbose mode, so that you can see all the details while the command is running. You would need to change the hard disk and folders name according to those inside your iMac and external drive.\nThere are other methods to recover your files, but I personally prefer to backup via the cp command.\n2. Install The OS\nBefore you jump to install, make sure all your files are properly backup. Check by opening the files to make sure they are not damaged. \nYou can boot into recovery mode by holding down on the CMD + R keys until you see the Apple logo. Choose the Reinstall Mac OS option. You'll need to connect to the internet to download and restore the system\n", "Q: Default resizing Split View to not blur one window In OS X El Capitan, Apple introduced a feature called \"Split View\" that allows you to put two fullscreen apps side by side. Normally when you click and drag the middle dividing line one of the two apps will blur. If you hold Option while moving the divider neither window will blur.\nHow can I make this the default behavior, so I don't have to hold Option when resizing?\n\nA: Resizing windows in split view no longer blurs one window as of macOS Catalina.\n", "Q: Compress multiple files in different folders Could someone help me with compressing thousands of files?\nI have a lot of folders and a lot of files in these folders, i would like to know if it's possible to compress each file separately.\nFoe example, folder 01 has folder 02 and 2 files in it, folder 02 has 2 files in it. I need to compress all files in all folders and leave these archives right where original files were.\nThank you!\n\n\nA: To do this, you can open up Terminal from inside your computer's /Applications/Utilities folder. Then change to the root directory containing all the other directories you want to zip the files in by typing this command:\ncd /path/to/folder01\n(replace /path/to/folder01 with wherever the folder is on your hard drive - it will give you the right path if you simply drag the folder icon from your Finder, right into the Terminal window.)\nthen type this command:\nfind . -type f -execdir zip '{}.zip' '{}' \\; -delete\nThis will compress all files (not directories) within the directory tree starting with the folder /folder01, leaving the .zip in the same directory as the original, and delete the originals. \nIf for some reason you don't want to delete the originals but rather leave them in place next to the .zip archives, you can omit the -delete at the end.\nI would recommend backing up the entire directory tree you're running this on first before trying it, just in case you make a typo or anything goes wrong. This worked as described for me, but you mess around in Terminal on your computer at your own risk.\n\nA: From memory, Stuffit Deluxe has this feature. There is an option to create individual archive files in the “Compression” preferences.\n", "Q: Did you used to be able to hardware upgrade your own Mac Pro?

I am logged into a remote system and have a special session that I have to request and wait to receive.  I know I can then use the \"xterm &\" command to open multiple xterm windows within that session, but xterm behaves differently from OSX's built-in Terminal.  Is there a way to open multiple Terminal windows within the existing SSH session?\n\nA: Yes, you can reuse exiting ssh connection and open ssh in whatever terminal you like. See this answer to a StackOverflow question for details:\n\nIf you open the first connection with -M:\nssh -M $REMOTEHOST\n\nsubsequent connections to $REMOTEHOST will \"piggyback\" on the\n  connection established by the master ssh.

Short version: Does the Macbook somehow draw more than 60W while in use?\nWe live in a house with a small solar power system. We've been here for 7 years and for most of that time have successfully run our (now rather elderly) Macbook on the 12v system. We do have 240v inverter to run the washing machine and food processor but it's pretty inefficient and not the right kind of sine wave for digital stuff anyway. So we use a car charger (not apple, obviously) to step up to 16.5v (giving 60w).\nIt charges the laptop fine and as far as I'm aware we've not managed to damage the laptop..! We noticed that the house lights flicker a little if we are using the computer while it's plugged in in the evening. I assumed this meant we were drawing too much power for the system, so we'd either switch most of the lights off or unplug the laptop. However, in the last couple of days it's started blowing the 8A socket fuse, which puzzles me. I've tried a couple of different sockets and measured the voltage at each. The voltage is above 12v (reading the same as the house battery) and the fuse blows at both.\nSurely the laptop should never be drawing more than 5A at the most? The interesting bit is that it only does if we're USING it while it's plugged in. If it's sleeping/off and charging, it's fine. Sadly, the battery no longer lasts long enough to use it while not plugged in, particularly if we're streaming TV/films. So I suppose my Mac-specific question is does the Macbook somehow draw more than 60W while in use...? Or can someone tell me why else it might be blowing an 8A fuse..?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible for the MacBook to draw more than 60W in heavy usage. I don't have specific numbers for your model (you do not list if you have a mid 2007 or late 2007) - but I once measured the early 2008 MacBook to draw 90W at max.\nYou can look at Activity Monitor to determine which app is using the power (i.e. which one is hogging up the CPU). \n\nA: You are using a 12V car charger and stepping up the voltage to 16V and it's melting?\nIt's melting because it's passing way more power than it can possibly handle.  What amperage is it rated for?  I would bet 500mA or 1A max.  It's melting and shorting out.  The question here is why don't you have a car charger cable with an inline fuse?\nTo get 60W on a 12V circuit, you need a 5A rating.\nYour MacBook REQUIRES 60W @ 16.5V so it needs 3.65A.   If you puling 5A off 12V adapter then boosting to 16.5V you are overworking that charger.  Additionally, without know what you have done to convert that 12V to 16V (I am praying you didn't do a DIY hookup) you may be dumping very \"dirty\" power directly into your MacBook.  This is why you need a switching power supply.\nSo, your MacBook will not draw more than 60W otherwise it will be over rated for the power adapter they supplied you.  The light flickering you are seeing is probably from the shorting of your 12V car charger.\nYou should be using an 12V DC to 110V INVERTER as well as a proper MacBook Power Adapter.\n\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2011 SSD Placement Location I just recently upgraded my 2012 macbook pro with a 250gb SSD and have succesfully clean installed a new OS on the SSD. I was also able to change the boot setting so that the SSD would boot first and be primary. I already erased the my existing HDD and will use it as a builtin storage.\nQuestion: The picture shows my current setup with the SSD being in the Optical Drive Tray. Would there be any significant changes if i placed the SSD on where the HDD is currently placed? Are the 2 connectors the same? Does it even matter?\n\nA: There will be no problem.  A SATA SSD has the same connectors as a SATA HDD drive so the connectors are identical.\n\n\nTo use you SSD in the optical bay, a optical bay drive kit is required.  You simply need to remove the SSD from the kit and replace it with the HDD into the same optical bay kit.\nTo answer your question...\n\nDoes it even matter?\n\nNope.  It makes no difference.  \n\nA: Frankly, I'm surprised that SSD works at all in the optical drive bay.\nDo you see that diagonal ribbon cable running across the top of the SSD? That's the cable for your WiFi and Bluetooth module. It passes directly over the SATA connector of the SSD. The 15\" and 17\" models from 2011 in particular have an electromagnetic interference problem with SATA III devices because of the way those connectors perfectly line up like that.\nThis is a \"design flaw\", but I use that term in quotes because it works exactly the way Apple intended. They never planned or supported anything other than an optical drive there. Yes, the port is SATA III, but their optical drives are only SATA I and those work fine (SATA III was a brand new thing in 2011).\nThe SSD might work faster if you swap positions with the HDD.  It's entirely possible that you've been experiencing errors the whole time and just never noticed because the SSD's error correction is silently coping with them. But constant error correction means slower performance. Usually people report strange behavior and weird corruption issues with SATA III drives in the optibay, so if yours has been working fine then maybe you just got lucky? Maybe the caddy you're using is high-quality? Or maybe your laptop is from the early 2011 batch that only had a SATA II connector in the optical bay.\nAnyway, from that picture it looks like you've still got the factory HDD installed in the HDD bay, so there's a good chance it's also a SATA II drive. There are no issues with SATA II drives in the optibay; only SATA III, so swapping the positions of the two drives may make things better for you.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi Disconnects When Locking iPhone I want to use Google Photos to back up my photos from my iPhone SE running iOS 10. I'm connected to Wi-Fi. I start the backup process and I connect my phone to power and then I lock it. It should just sit there and happily back up my photos. But if I come back to it after a few minutes, it seems like it had disconnected from Wi-Fi and that it only just reconnected after I unlocked it again. When I open the Google Photos app, it has to start backing up all over again.\nHow can I keep my iPhone connected to Wi-Fi while it's locked? (Like it should be!)\n\nA: I've found that ios devices tend to drop connection when they are locked if your 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks share same name.\nTry changing one of your network's name.\n\nA: Turn wifi on (doesn’t matter if you connect to a wifi network now or later, but the wifi toggle must be on). If your ios device supports mobile data, turn it off for now.\nTurn off the device (by keeping the sleep button pressed and then swiping)\nWait 30s\nTurn it on\nAfter the home screen loads, reset it (hold the home and sleep buttons down and keep holding until you see the apple logo)\nThat’s it.\n\nA: If you are connected to power, the Wi-Fi should stay up. If you are not on power, it should drop as both of those are intended functions.\nI would ask Google support if their app is fully capable of background sync over WiFi and watch your cellular data in case it does sync when WiFi drops since each app developer can use different sync API and background code so there's no general answer as to what any one app uses since the developer can change how an app functions from week to week, it will depend on your exact iOS version and the exact version of the google app.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem on iOS 16. The internet suggests that this is intentional, though it is unclear whether not reconnecting is a bug or not.\nThis is a workaround I found, that prevents Wi-Fi from getting disconnected during sleep. Get a music app (such as YouTube music or its alternatives) and play something that is hours of silence. This drains battery, but at least it prevents the problem from occurring.\n", "Q: Can i have a state in OS X where there is no default browser I'd like OS X to default to whichever browser is open (i.e. have no default browser) so that links in other applications don't go off and open a second browser. \nIs this possible (without copy/paste). An example would be that I'm listening to music in google music in chrome and i click a link in my Evernote and/or Wunderlist app and Safari is called to open; okay most times but not this particular time.\n\nA: A number of apps will let you do approximately this, but as far as I'm aware only Choosy ($10) has the flexibility to decide which to use based on which browsers are open. (All of these apps are designed to let you pick a browser when you click a link, and some, Choosy included, also let you make rules based on the link URL or source app. If that's all you need, then you may find another option might serve you better.)\nTo make Choosy work in this way, simply install it, add your browsers to the \"Browsers\" tab in its settings, and then set the options in \"Behaviour\" how you want them. Based on what you said above, I expect you probably want to set the first option listed to \"Use best running browser.\"\n\n", "Q: Can I use PC3L RAM on my 2010 MBP? I tried googling but didn't get any adequate results. \nI have a 13 inch MacBook Pro mid-2010 and would like to upgrade the RAM. I have a ram module which says this on the front:\n\n8GB 2Rx8 PC3L-12800S-11-13-F3\n\nand the company is SK Hynix. \nOn Apple's support page it states that PC3 RAM is needed. However, I'm wondering if my PC3L RAM would work. My current RAM is 4 GB and if I used this I could potentially increase it to 10 GB. \nI ask because sometimes Apple's support pages don't give you the whole answer. For example, it is possible to have up to 16 GB of ram on my Mac model, but the Apple site says only 8 GB is possible. So I'm wondering whether my PC3L RAM could be used as well. \nP.S. I don't want my Mac to explode or anything \n\nA: I doubt that it will work. It depends on whether the 8GB 2Rx8 PC3L-12800S-11-13-F3 also works in 1.5 V mode (instead of 1.35 V - PC3L means PC3 Low voltage).\nIf 1.5 V are allowed you will find a similar question and answers here: Can I use DDR3 1600MHz RAM in a Mac instead of 1067MHz?\nIn the comments you will find the hint to keep one of the slower modules mounted  - then it may work if your MBP isn't too picky.

However, the system will only boot to Recovery and Safe Mode - when booting \"normally\", the system eventually gets stuck at the progress bar and pressing any key only yields that \"error\" sound as if one would press a not allowed keyboard combo.\nI guess this is because the system believes that the GPU is still the dual-GPU setup from the old MacBook (Intel on-chip + Radeon), and now fails to recognize the new GPU.

They play at the volume of the overall Mac, which is up full and should be.  But everything else on the computer is an appropriate volume (system sounds, browser, etc.), Skype is just way WAY too loud.\nThis is only its chat and related sound effects, NOT calls.  Has nothing whatsoever to do with voice calls.\nSkype does have its own volume control, but it also does absolutely nothing, both for the sound effects AND calls.  Has no effect whatsoever.\nIs there any way to quiet just Skype down?\nEDIT: Another observation in case it's somehow relevant - changing Skype's audio devices in preferences also does nothing.  All sound effects (non-call related) always come out the internal speaker regardless of what device I select.\n\nA: What you can do is to disable the sound effects, for each individual \"event\" (incoming call, new message received, etc).\nOr, even better, you can associate to each event a different sound effect, maybe with a different volume.\nTo do this, you need to go to the preferences, and choose the \"Notifications\" panel. Then, you choose each individual \"Event\" for which you want to turn off the sound (via the first drop-down menu), and turn it off by means of the \"Play sound\" check button.\nYou can also choose a different sound effect (maybe with a different volume) by choosing a different audio file. This is done using the drop-down menu next to \"Play sound\", and selecting the last option: \"Add/Remove...\".\nYou can then select your file using the \"+\" button on the bottom-left corner of the small pop-up window.\nTo have different volumes you will need to create/edit the audio files, and change their volume, before you associate them to the Skype events.\n", "Q: Wine won't open any programs Running macOS Sierra(Version 10.12.2 16C67).\nI installed Wine version wine-1.8.6 (through a .pkg file).

I have a windows server that runs DHCP and has a small range setup for reimaging.  The clients used to get an IP in this range, however, since upgrading the Mac Server to 10.12 they are getting an IP address outside the DHCP range and causing IP conflicts.  It just seems to pick a random IP.\nMy DHCP range is 192.168.17.130 - 192.168.17.160. The Macs are getting IP's like 192.168.17.83 (which is already allocated to another device on the network).  My DHCP server is not showing any mention of the Mac client, and it also has lots of available IP's to lease.\nI do not have DHCP server turned on, on any of my Mac Servers.\nAs you could imagine it is causing the reimage's to go really slow and act strange. \n\nA: Despite the Mac server's DHCP service being \"off\", it might still be handing out addresses to DHCP clients. The DHCP and NetInstall/NetBoot services are both handled by the same daemon, bootpd (although NetInstall also activates TFTP and NFS). Theoretically, if NetInstall is on but DHCP is off, bootpd should be running but not handing out addresses over DHCP. But in at least some versions there's a bug that can lead to DHCP being fully active despite being \"off\".\nThe bug seems to occur when both DHCP and NetInstall are turned on, then DHCP is switched off, but the bootpd daemon doesn't seem to get the message and keeps doing DHCP. Generally, the solution is simple: switch both DHCP and NetInstall off, then switch just NetInstall on.\nTo confirm, check the log (system.log specifically) on the Mac server, look for entries from bootpd. You should see \"BSDP\" entries, but not \"DHCP\". See this Apple support document for some examples (although it has both BSDP and DHCP running).\n", "Q: Unable to access 10.2.3 16D17a machine over network I was in the midst of attempting to setup the built in apache webserver to do some light network file sharing to my iOS device that I didn't wish to sync, discovered that I can only access network related stuff from the machine itself and no other device on the network except the router can seem to discover the machine.\nFor example, I can access the built in webserver via it's IP and localhost (as well as *.local) if I do it directly on the same machine. If I try to access the webserver using the IP address or the .local address from my iPhone connected to the network, the page times out. I also cannot seem to ping the machine from my iPhone either, however when I ping the machine from the router, the router gets a response.\nI also attempted to try installing MAMP and use the :8888 setting for Apache but it still can't be resolved from anywhere else on the network other than from the machine itself.\nCuriously, I also cannot ping my iOS device from the macOS machine, only from the router. But, if I use canyouseeme.org to check if my running torrent app's forwarded port is working, the website is able to connect to the app on my machine.\nThe only thing to note is that both the iOS device and macOS machine are both on the latest beta versions available.\nI do not feel as if this is a router issue as I've used the .local and IP address just fine to access previously configured apache setups on previous OS X versions. With most updates, it seems to reset the server configs and as such I have had to restore the settings. Up until now, this process has been working fine. I don't understand why this isn't working now, possibly a bug in the beta?\n\nIP-addresses:\nmacOS Machine: 192.168.1.5\niPhone: 192.168.1.3\n\nA: I believe I found a solution.\nIt appears that there may have been a change by Apple in how the Bonjour service handles router security.\nI had changed my router to WPA2 due to needing to use the built in recovery system in the macOS bootloader, as it was not functional with WEP security.\nI happened to notice that my AirPrint printer was no longer being seen on the network as well and I also couldn't ping it, so I changed the security back to WEP to test and Bonjour services started working again. I was able to print as well as access the apache server from my macOS machine from the iPhone across the network with the .local name.\nNot being happy with having to use WEP again as it's far less secure than WPA2, I went about looking for a solution.\nI have an Actiontec router used for my FiOS setup. It's a MI424-WR revision C with Firmware 4.0.16.1.56.0.10.14.4\nLogged in and changed the following option:\nAdvanced -> IGMP Proxy -> Enabled \n\nBonjour services appear to be functioning properly now with WPA2 enabled.

It currently has OS X 10.6.8.  I do not have the original Snow Leopard installation disk.\nIt currently has the original 250GB hard drive, and I wish to replace it with a SSD. I'd also like to upgrade to OS X 10.7 Lion - the latest version that supports this model. The OS upgrade is not absolutely necessary, but I figure that I may as well upgrade the OS if I can.\nI have no data or software on the current drive that I need to keep.\nI've looked for but could not find information on the Internet that will guide me on the procedure to replace the current hard drive and install a compatible OS.\nCan anyone refer me to a document that will guide me, or perhaps suggest the appropriate course of action?\n\nA: Acquiring Snow Leopard 10.6\nShould you need the physical disk, you can order the Snow Leopard 10.6 installation disk directly from Apple, from this page: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard\nAcquiring Lion 10.7\nLikewise, you can order Lion 10.7 from Apple, from this page: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/D6106Z/A/os-x-lion.  Note that you will not receive physical disks, but an email with a content code for the Mac App Store that you can use to download the Lion 10.7 upgrade.\nIf you had not already purchased Lion 10.7 through the App Store (before July 2012), you will no longer be able to locate it there; Apple has removed it and Lion 10.7 can no longer be purchased for download through the App Store.  As you're using 2006-era hardware, you will not be able to upgrade to a newer OS version than Lion 10.7.  See this MacWorld article for additional information.\nUpgrading the Hard Drive\nThis fantastic article shows how to replace the hard drive on a Mac Pro machine.  Follow the steps, and you will have the new hard drive functional in just a few minutes.\nThe basic steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have a compatible SSD (check the compatibility chart for the SSD vendor)\n\n*Get your small Phillips head screwdriver ready in advance\n\n*Follow proper anti-static procedures (static kills computer equipment)\n\n*Open and remove the side access door, using the latch on the rear of the machine\n\n*Choose an empty hard drive bay, make sure that it's unlocked, and pull it out\n\n*Connect the SSD to the tray using the 4 Phillips head screws\n\n*Slide the tray (with SSD) back into place in the machine and make sure that it is properly seated\n\n*Replace and close the side access door\n\n\nAt this point, you will have the original hard drive and the new SSD installed and ready for use.\nTransfer Content to New Hard Drive\nYou can use the Disk Utility program to transfer the content from your previous Snow Leopard hard disk to the new SSD.  Detailed instructions can be found in this article.\nThe essential steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode (hold ⌘ R during boot)\n\n*Launch Disk Utility from Recovery Mode\n\n*Select the disk partition\n\n*Choose the Restore pane on the right side of the window\n\n*Select the target partition (the new SSD)\n\n*Click the Restore button to start the cloning process\n\n\nBe prepared for the process to take a considerable amount of time, especially if the original hard disk has a lot of content; all of that content needs to be moved.\nUpgrading to Lion 10.7\nThis is a great point to do the upgrade to Lion 10.7, because you now have a backup copy of the original hard drive and can safely restore if any problems occur.\nLifeHacker has a great article that covers the upgrade process.\nThese steps can be summarized as such:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your machine's compatibility against the specs\n\n*Update your OS X system and apps before you start\n\n*Open the App Store, go to Purchases, and enter your Lion 10.7 content code\n\n*If you cannot see the Lion download at this point, hold the ⌘ key and click the Purchases tab again and click Download\n\n*After the download is complete, click the Continue button on the installation window\n\n*Agree to the license terms, choose your SSD volume, and provide your Administrator password when prompted\n\n*The installation process will begin, and may take some time as your system is upgraded\n\n*Once installation has completed, restart your machine\n\n*Update your OS X system and apps to the current compatible versions\n\n\nAt this point, you should have a fully functional Lion 10.7 installation, ready for use.\nCleaning Up\nOnce the SSD has all of the content from the original hard drive, the hard drive may either be removed or used as a secondary storage location.  Remember that this is a 12-year-old hard drive, and operational lifetimes for hard drives are typically in the 5-8 year range.  If there are any issues at all with the hard drive, you're better off removing and disposing of it (many electronics stores will properly dispose of it for you).\nIf you decide to keep the original hard disk, this can give you quite a lot of available disk space, but you should erase or repartition it for 2 main reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*to prevent boot-time confusion about which volume (disk) is primary\n\n*to reclaim the storage used by the content that is now cloned to the SSD\n\n", "Q: Have second user in window and not whole desktop I have to use a different user on my mac for some tasks which include regular switching between users. I know about quick user switching, but this has two limitations for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have to enter the password each time I switch users\n\n*I would like to have the second user in a window and not the whole desktop (as in a virtual machine)\n\n\nI would prefer the solution 2.\nIs there a way of logging in to the local machine as user2 while being logged in as user1 so that the desktop of user2 is shown in a window and I can easily switch? Do I have to use VNC or is there a build in option which I could (ab)use?\n\nA: OK - I have found a solution using Real-vnc. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Real-vnc version 5.3.2 from their download site. It is important to not install a newer version, as this seems to be the last version which supports User-mode for the server without a paid subscription!\n\n*As the server stops when a fast user switch occurs it is important to change the following setting (from the real-vnc knowledge base):\n\n... setting the option \"StopUserModeOnSwitchOut\" to \"No\" in the Expert tab\n  (VNC Server > Options > Expert tab).\n\n\n\n*Quit VNC server (this is the service). We don't need the global VNC server service as we will use the User Mode.\n\n*Now switch to the other user and login\n\n*Start VNC server (user mode). If you want to, you can add it to the Login Items to have it autostart upon login.\n\n*Switch back to your main user\n\n*use Screen Sharing app or the VNC Viewer app to connect to localhost. It is possible that you have to set a password in the VNC server, but I am not sure (the viewer will tell you).\n\n\nThat's it - it works perfectly for me, even with multiple monitor setup.\nWhat I didn't manage, was to setup that the viewer uses both monitors - but I can live with that.\n", "Q: ipfw ruleset limit We are using ipfw in OSX 10.6 Server, 10.7 Server... all working fine until we add too many rules, I think. \nipfw will still work, but only process up to certain number of rules.\nCurrently wc -l /etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf gives 10486.\nipfw is giving an Abort Trap after partially processing the file /etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf.

MagSafe negotiates available power with the Dallas 1-wire protocol. USB Power Delivery (PD) is an unrelated protocol. Answers based on experience with MagSafe are unlikely to be relevant.\nI'm considering buying a 2016 MacBook Pro Retina about which this article says:\n\nthe Griffin product was only powerful enough to offer 60W of power, not quite enough for the 87W needed to power the larger Pro models at fully\n\nI'm also considering buying a LG 27UD88-W which it advertised as providing:\n\nMobile / Laptop Charging Up to 60W\n\nWhat are the consequences of using a 60W supply instead of an 87W one?\nDoes it just mean it will take longer to charge the laptop?\nCould it have side effects such as putting parts of the system into a slower, low-energy mode?\nThis question covers MagSafe power supplies but Charles Duffy's comment suggests that the rules for USB-C may be different.\n\nA: According to this article from Apple,\n\nThe best way to charge your MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3 is to use the AC adapter that came with the computer. Using an underpowered AC adapter, like those that come with iPad, will make charging slower.\n\nFrom that, I deduce it's an accepted practice and that there's no harm in doing that.\nWhat it's not so clear to me is whether an underpowered laptop runs in power adapter mode, battery mode or what, and how that affects its performance.\n\nA: Apple partnered with LG to create a 4K monitor that outputs 60W via USB-C. Apple has mentioned full compatibility with a 13\" MacBook Pro (comes with 61W power adapter) but mentioned that with a 15\" MacBook Pro, the battery will get drawn during intensive power usage and therefore it should be connected to its 87W power adapter. No mention of any dangers in doing this.\n\nA: I am an Apple Certified Mac Technician working for an Apple Authorized Service Provider.\nI and my co-workers have seen this occur multiple times. When the MacBook tries to pull more power than the power adapter can supply, it will do one (or more) of three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn out the power adapter internally\n\n*Cause physical burn marks (scorching) on the MagSafe connector\n\n*Damage the internal power control circuitry on the logic board\n\n\nThe first two issues are easy enough to fix; you can replace the power adapter and the MagSafe board inside the computer for a (relatively) low amount of money. If the internal circuitry is damaged, you'll be in for a new logic board which can easily be $500 + labour, and Apple will not cover this as it will be considered \"accidental damage\".\nThe MacBook Pro 2016s have not been out for very long, and our shop hasn't yet seen the damage that can be caused by under-powering a USB-C charging port. That being said, I expect that much the same symptoms/issues will occur in that case.\nAs answers on the MagSafe thread state, just get a full-wattage power adapter. Consider the slightly-higher cost as your insurance against needing to replace the logic board in you brand-new 2016 MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: iTunes says I have 8k photos but I only have 6k on my iPhone?

The old option 'Ignore accidental touches while typing' which is apparently enabled by default now does not seem to do anything at all. I'm using MacOS 10.12.2 on a 2016 MacBook Pro, and I have tap-to-touch turned off.\n\nA: Agreed the setting on by default does not actually disable the trackpad. It just tries to be \"smart\" about it, ignore accidental touches.\nThe only way that I have found is enabling \"Mouse Keys\" in System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse and Trackpad. Check the \"Enable Mouse Keys\" checkbox. When it is enabled, you can disable/enable the trackpad by pressing the option key 5 times.\nIt is not really a full solution, but between that and the \"Disable trackpad when external mouse or trackpad is present\" option it is as close as it gets. \nYou can also increase the resistance of the click of trackpad in the Trackpad settings in System Preferences which may help.\n\nA: The best way to do stop accidental touches is to disable Tap to Click in e.g. MacOS Big Sur trackpad settings.\n\nA: An information that I read at some point on the internet, I don't remember where (not on the Apple website): if you rest your hand on the trackpad while typing, macOS is smart and ignores their movement.\nIn fact, typing does not matter. Try to do a gesture, any gesture, using the palm. It does not react. A palm and a finger produces the regular mouse moving, like the palm is not there. The same for gestures involving more fingers.\nSince your fingers are on the keyboard and you touch the trackpad only with your palms, their movement does not produce clicks or moves of the mouse cursor.\nApple has solved the problem some time ago (maybe this is the reason why they removed the \"Ignore accidental clicks while typing\" setting), they just forgot to make the information public somehow.\n", "Q: How to identify a corrupted file system early I recently had an external hard drive develop a corrupted file system.  At first, I started noticing some errors when trying to open certain files on it, and now OSX has told me that it has frozen the disk as read-only.  I have everything backed up, so it is not a catastrophic problem.  But, it is still a hassle to deal with.  I would like to find a way to identify such issues sooner.  \nI'm not concerned about identifying bad sectors or failing hardware issues (such as discussed here: How to identify and fix files with corrupted / inaccessible disk blocks), as I have other software in place already to deal with those.  \nMy naive approach to this would be to either:\n(a) write a script that goes and tries to open all of my key files periodically to check for errors and/or (b) periodically doing full checksums against my backup.  Both of these, however, seem both slow and troublesome in terms of the extra wear they put on disks.\nMy ideal solution would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify file system corruption early\n\n*Pinpoint precisely which files/directories are affected (so that I can address just those affected locations).\nIf that second point isn't really achievable (I'd need to have a pretty high confidence in getting every problem file and location identified), then I'd at least settle for the first.\nI know that there is some third party software (e.g. Diskwarrior) that advertises an ability to diagnose these problems early, but I am unclear about how effective it actually is at that.\n\nA: This is what SMART status is for.\nI use a product called DiskDrill, that besides the recovery tools (paid) they have a number of free utilities including a SMART status monitor that will warn you proactively if a number of erros start popping up.\nAs for you data, the best approach is the \"ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" approach.  Create and stick to a back up plan where you have not one (Time Machine) backup, but a secondary (like iCloud and OneDrive).  When you have multiple copies, you greatly reduce the chance of data loss.\n", "Q: Suddenly unable to screenshot- Do not have permission to save files in the location where screenshots are stored Recieved the error:\n 'Your screenshot could not be saved.

There's no point in direct numerical comparison the macOS load average of the Mach Kernel with linux, AIX, BSD or other UNIX since the underlying architecture is different here.\nWhat does translate to traditional UNIX system is counting active threads and watching overall CPU utilization. With more than a thousand threads being actively run (maybe a third are inactive enough to be marked \"sleeping\"), I wouldn't try to tune or change anything if I saw that on any of my hundreds of production Mac and OS X servers.\nIf you're really curious, I would run top -u -s 60 and let the system reach neutral (in iostat the 15m average you show is higher than the 1m average, which means the CPU usage is trending lower - when the three values are about the same, that's a good neutral to measure). Also, run sysctl hw.logicalcpu so you can normalize the value you see to the cores that are available. Even when your load is higher than the CPU available, it might not be a problem if your constraints are for IO, network or elsewhere than the CPU.\nWhat are the top 5 CPU using processes when you have a slow refresh on top? Those will be causing the most load in your situation in all likelihood.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make the Enter key work with a Logitech K811 keyboard? The key is labeled such that it looks like holding down fn and pressing Return will produce Enter (as with Apple’s keyboards). However, when I do that it only produces a regular Return.\n\nA: If you don't need to use fn otherwise, you could simply remap it to behave like Enter. This is easily doable using the free tool Karabiner-Elements — download and install it, then add a \"Simple Modification\" from fn to keypad_enter. If you want to only remap your external keyboard, then set the checkboxes in the Devices tab appropriately.\n\nIf you want to keep fn's functionality, you need a more advanced remapping/macro utility such as BetterTouchTool or Keyboard Maestro. I'm not aware of any free options in this realm (though they may exist) besides the full version of Karabiner, which doesn't currently work on Sierra.\nfn is not a typical modifier key, so it can't be captured in the same ways that the others (e.g. ⌥ and ⌘) can. Because of this, there is no way I'm aware of to assign fnreturn to anything. However, using one of the tools I mentioned, you can easily assign another hotkey to do the same thing, for example, ⌥return.\n\nA: @MichaelTsai I'm betting that this is a Logitech driver issue.  I have used the K811 for a couple of years and have had no problem with fn-return as enter (as well as the mappings for fn-arrow keys and fn-delete outlined in this help document).\nHowever, I just recently upgraded to Sierra (currently 10.12.6) and upgraded my Logitech options/firmware (v6.70.1030). Shortly after doing so, I realized that fn-return no longer worked.  The other fn mappings still do and, weirder still, all of the fn mappings work perfectly fine using my MacBook's built-in keyboard.\nSo, I opened up the Keyboard Viewer to see what was going on and the problem became obvious. When typing on the Macbook's built-in keyboard, the keyboard viewer shows the normal keyboard like so:.\n\nWhen you hold down the fn key, the return key turns into the Enter symbol (⌅) as expect.\nHowever, as soon as you type on the K811, the keyboard viewer switches to an extended keyboard (with numeric keypad):\n\nIn this configuration, the fn key has no effect on the Return key's symbol (or, obviously output).\nMy guess is that the Logitech firmware is incorrectly defining the keyboard type for the operating system.  I have filed a support ticket with Logitech (case #06038823) and will let you know what they say.\n", "Q: App called TV appeared then changed to videos I saw the apple livestream saying the TV app would be pushed out to all iOS devices via an update. However, the app just appeared for me today without any update at all. It then was removed and the Videos app (which I'd removed) was added onto my phone.\nWhy did this happen? I have removed videos again - can I prevent it reinstalling?\n\nA: This happened to me when I changed to the US iTunes Store from the UK one. 'TV' is only available in the US. Logging out of iTunes & App Stores in Settings and logging in again has restored 'Videos' on my iPad\n", "Q: Photostream screensaver on apple tv3 and ios 10.x? I have always had whatever photos I take with my iphone, automagically in my photostream, and those then making up the screensaver of my apple tv 3. I guess with whatever is different with apple photos/photostream now, this connection doesn't work any longer.\nAny suggestions?\nThe iphone and apple tv are signed in to the same icloud account.\n\nA: So, at some point, Settings->iCloud->iCloud Photos Settings got a new option: iCloud Photo Sharing. I'm pretty sure enabling this is what allowed me to select my photos as before.\n", "Q: Can I see if/when someone opens Messages on my Mac? I'm concerned my roommate is looking at my text messages via the Messages app on my computer. Is there a way to know if/when the Messages app is opened on the computer? Maybe a notification or email to my iPHone?\n\nA: There are a number of applications which let you create macros and scripts and trigger them in various ways. I have the most experience with Keyboard Maestro, so that's what I used for the example macro below. However, as Tetsujin commented, simply password protecting your computer probably makes more sense from a security standpoint; there isn't really any reason someone else should have access to your account.\n\n\nA: When you open Messages.app, it often leaves a timestamped indication in the \"Diagnostic and Usage Data\" and \"System Log\" reports in your Console app (located in /Applications/Utilities) which can be found by selecting them and entering \"Messages\" in the search box at the upper right of the window, as shown here: \n\n\nAlternatively, an inexpensive app like Time Sink (App Store link) can record a timestamped log of all programs and documents opened on your computer. However, if your roommate is crafty enough, they can just quit Time Sink before doing their evil deeds, then restart it again when they're done, preventing it from recording their actions. However, if they don't know it's there or what it does, this will show if they were on your computer when you weren't home.\nFinally, the free app ControlPlane (website) can run silently in the background and execute scripts when specified applications are open. However, it's a bit technical and intricate to set up, and you'd need to write your own Applescript or BASH script for ControlPlane to run to log the application opening. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) graphic card issues First of all this is my hardware:\n\nWhen i power on my new mac book pro (with touch bar) i figured out a strange problem (i think is related with my graphic card). \nThis is the procedure to get that issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on my mac\n\n*Type my credentials\n\n*the first window i open (in this case the \"spotlight\" window) appears in this way:\n\nThere are a lot of white pixel ...\n\n*Then if i close the spotlight window and i open again that problem disappear.\n\n\nIf i restart my mac i don't have this problem.

Up until a few months ago, when you uploaded a new build to iTunes Connect and tried to publish to TestFlight or the app store, Apple would display a simple yes-or-no dialog asking if your app uses cryptography. A few months ago, this dialog started containing a more detailed description of the export compliance guidelines, and some helpful advice about when you needed to select \"yes\" or \"no\" (I think it was something to the effect of \"You can select 'no' if any of the following are true:\" followed by a list of conditions).\nToday when uploading a TestFlight build I am seeing the old dialog again - no detailed description or advice. Did Apple undo this change, or does it only show for app store builds?\n(Please note I am not asking for advice on which option to choose; I already understand the export compliance process.)\n\nA: Apple undid this change, it would appear. There was no mention of the additional guidance being added and also no mention of it being removed, but it's definitely gone now.\nI could speculate that due to the nature of changes to copy regarding legal features of iTunes Connect, that someone in the legal department decided that the change was unsuitable, but there's been no confirmation of anything to this effect.\n", "Q: What is the difference between macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Update and macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Combo Update?

Thank you.\n\nA: I believe that the \"normal\" update only has the changes from 10.12.1 to 10.12.2; therefore, you need to have 10.12.1 already installed.\nThe combo one, OTOH, has all the changes from the last major release (10.12.0).\n", "Q: Mac mini 2012 with Dell U2717D & Dell U2417H So I'm having an odd issue. I'm pretty sure this only started since macOS 10.12 but I can't say for sure.\nI'm using a late 2012 Mac mini with two displays. The first display is a Dell U2717D connected via DisplayPort. Resolution is 2560x1440 @ 60hz. I've never had any problems at all with this monitor connected to the mini. The second display is a Dell U2417H, connected via HDMI at 1080p resolution. I only recently started using it with my Mac mini again, but I use to use them both together on the mini without issue.\nIf I start up the mini with both monitors connected everything works perfect. The problem only arises if I power down the HDMI second display or plug it in after the mini has already been running.\nWhat happens is the DisplayPort main display loses it's signal. Nothing I do can fix it other then restarting the computer. I've tried unplugging / cycling power on both displays in every combination. Once the main display loses it's signal the mini has to be restarted. The HDMI second display continues to work fine. The mini still recognizes the main display but gathers the Display settings pane to the second display as if it knows the main display isn't working.\nAnyone have any ideas?\nThanks.\n\nA: There are two things I would try at the outset: Resetting your SMC and NVRAM. Instructions follow.\nResetting the SMC on your Mac Mini\nThere are a number of ways you can reset the SMC on the Mac mini. My preferred option on older Mac minis is to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from power\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds\n\n*Plug it back in and turn it on.\n\n\nNote: If you prefer, you can also use Apple's latest steps for doing this instead. If so, ensure you're using the option for Reset the SMC on Mac desktop computers.\nResetting the NVRAM on your Mac Mini\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine.

I just bought a new one and decided to put in a Windows 10 USB to boot from since I never used macOS that often anymore. Once I got everything setup there were no drivers (which was expected), so I downloaded them from the Bootcamp Assistant tool on a friends computer. When I try and launch the drivers setup.exe I get the error \"This version of Bootcamp is not intended for this computer model\".

After 6 years, that employee is no longer with us, so I am trying to re-install the OS.  I have done this with Windows and Ubuntu many times.\nHere's the problem:  I restarted the computer per some YouTube video, holding Command+R.  This worked and I got into some admin help screen.  \nI clicked \"Re-install OS X\" which required me to connect to the internet (ok, fine).  Then I had to sign in with some Apple ID (ok, fine).  But then I kept getting an error message that \"this account hasn't been used in the app store\" or some kind of thing.  After a while of reading advice, I found out I had to install iTunes on my own computer, then update the billing info.\nI repeated the install process.  That worked to get past the \"this account hasn't been used in the app store\" error.  Then a new error that there was some connection issue with the App Store for my Apple ID (ok, fine--that happens).  An hour later, it seemed to be able to connect.\nA new error:  \"This item is not available right now.  Please try again later.\"  After another forever of reading, I found out that I was supposed to set up iCloud for some reason, and this would fix the error.  It did.  \nI re-do the installation process for the 34293rd time and some random error I can't remember.  So I close the Re-Install OS X application and open the \"Help?\" one.  It says, \"Hey--just re-format the disk and install.\"  So, I did that and now there's a blank disk, and the OS still won't install because that is \"unavailable\" for some reason.\nI have all the original items: keyboard, mouse, OS Installation Disk, Application Installation Disk, some papers, and the original box.  There is an Apple Store 45 minutes away and this iMac is 27\" so I really, really don't want to spend hours doing that.\nFor the love of God, what am I supposed to do to re-install the OS?\nP.S.  I have tried booting from the install disk, the HDD (before it was formatted), and using recovery by booting with Command+R.\nUpdate\nSo, I tried the suggestions in the (at the moment) only answer here.  They were actually pretty helpful and got me through some errors.  Nonetheless, there were another half dozen issues (eliding quite a few hours here):\n\n\n*\n\n*At some point it stopped letting me boot into the firmware screen (seemingly randomly).\n\n*At that time, each time it powered on it defaulted to \"Reinstalling over the Internet\".  I let that run its course for a while --twice-- and the conclusion of that was the message, \"The system cannot be restored over the internet\" (or equivalent, I don't recall the exact wording at the moment). There was no apparent ability to log in with my Apple ID or anything, so that was that =)\n\n*I managed to boot from the original installation DVD.  After running through the installation process there, the conclusion was: \"OS X cannot be installed on this device.\"\n\n*I called a friend who uses only Macs for many years and he gave me some tips.\n\n*I tried a few utilities to create a bootable USB drive, but I couldn't get the iMac to recognize the USB drive as bootable (though Disk Utility did recognize it exists on 3 out of 4 boot attempts).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn the end, I created an Ubuntu live cd (v16.04x64).  It took maybe 3-4 minutes to burn the DVD, booted and installed in about 5 minutes and looks & feels great on the nice screen and beautiful hardware.  C'est la vie.\nSide note:  In the Linux paradigm, the OS doesn't follow the user or the machine.  Just install it whenever, wherever.\n\nA: This isn't really an answer right now, it's a selection of possibilities which need testing &/or confirmation they've been tried & failed.\nWhile there was still an old OS on the machine,  Cmd ⌘   R   should have run Recovery which would give you the opportunity to re-install the current OS, providing you could supply the Apple ID credentials initially used to 'purchase' the OS on that machine. Otherwise you would get the 'not available right now' issue.  \nThis is where the paradigm differs from MS Windows. With Windows the OS belongs to the machine & you have to ring MS to move it to another, but not to reinstall on the same machine. With Apple the OS [& many apps work this way too] is owned by the person & can be freely moved or re-used, but not transferred to another owner.\nAssuming the machine has at some point in the past had the necessary firmware update [that machine was first released  right on the cusp of this technology] then if either the Recovery partition fails [or has been erased] or you hit  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   R  at boot, then it will go into Internet Recovery mode rather than local.\nThis will allow you, without any Apple ID sign in, to download & install the OS that was first shipped with the machine - in this case 10.6.6.\nFrom there it would be a two-step process to update to Sierra, as you would first need to instal El Capitan.  \nA third alternative is to boot from the original CD/DVD - hold  C  at the boot chimes which will launch an older version of the setup process.\nYour last alternative, as you suspected, is to take it to an Apple Store, who will do it for you.\n", "Q: Transfer data between two Mac via USB-C I want to transfer files between two late 2016 MacBook Pros. I have a USB-C data cable from my external USB-C hard drive.\nCan I connect the Macs using that USB-C data cable to transfer files?\nOr do I need to put one of the Macs in target disk mode?\n\nA: You needs to put one of the computer in Target Disk Mode (Press T on startup) and connect another USB-C equipped Mac with a USB-C cable (or USB-C to USB Adapter/Cable for older computer) Note that the USB-C cable that come with your MacBook Pro 2016 does not work.\nThere are a more complicated method (and this requires a Thunderbolt 3 Cable (or use a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter and a Thunderbolt 2 Cable for older computers) and both computer have to be a Mac that support Thunderbolt. But this does not requires Target Disk Mode. Connect both Macs with the Thunderbolt cable (or with the adapter) and go to System Preferences > Network on both Mac. Go to Thunderbolt bridge (add one if it doesn't exist) and there set configure IPv4 to manually on both. Now set Subnet Mask on both to 255.255.255.0, now give two IPs to both computer (i.e. 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.2). Now you can use File Sharing (and other shadings) with the two Macs by Thunderbolt when you use the IP address.\n", "Q: How do I install sv.net/classic with wine on macOS?

He have released a new version of SongBeamer just for this case. Here the Link: Download (today is the: 06.01.2017) Just in case please go to the website and watch out for a newer version. If there is one then download it. Probably it will be more stable. \n\nA: Don't know whether I did something special, but if you change the name of the printer there is an option to print to PDF.\n\n\nA: By the looks of it, because whoever coded it thought they knew better than Apple, so completely ignored the Mac-standard toolbox & wrote their own print dialog - & in the process forgot there's a reason to use standard toolboxes.\n\nFrom Patrix's answer, it may be possible to add an Adobe pdf 'printer' from System Prefs > Printers & scanners.\nClick the + sign at the bottom & see if you are offered one.\n\nI think mine may have come from an old install of Adobe Acrobat which I no longer have. If so, maybe see if they do a free trial, which might just get you the PDF Printer as an add-on.\nI found this link to a free trial of Acrobat which may offer the same thing as I have, though untested.\n", "Q: How to usb tether a wifi network using iphone I have installed windows 10 on my Mac and the Wi---Fi is interfering with the Bluetooth so I've turned off the Wi-Fi on the Mac.\nMy iPhone is connected to the Wi-Fi so I want to usb-tether the Wi-Fi to my mac through my iPhone.\nBut I have noticed that usb-tether is using cellular connection instead of Wi-Fi which costs me money.\nIs there a way to usb-tether a Wi-Fi network instead of cellular network?\nAndroid happily do this. After all it is common sense to tether the gateway.\n\nA: The personal hotspot feature uses the cellular data connection. It's currently not possible to share the Wi-Fi connection from your iPhone without jailbreaking.\nIf your iPhone is jailbroken you can use Bridge Mode with MyWi.\n", "Q: Lock keyboard from CLI I used to use kextload and kextunload to unlock/lock my keyboard. However, the actual kernel extension changes between MacBook  models, and that can have unexpected results.\nFor example, if the kext is AppleUSBTCKeyboard, both unloading and loading work fine. However, if the kext is AppleHIDKeyboard (e.g. MacBook Air), unloading works but loading again does not. This means kextunload -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleHIDKeyboard will disable the keyboard, but then it cannot be reenabled with kextload and the machine has to be rebooted.\nThere are some apps that are still able to do it, like KeyboardCleanTool. I’d prefer a CLI way of doing it, though. If possible (but won’t be picky) using only tools that come with macOS, or an open-source one.\nBonus points if there’s also a way to lock the trackpad, but that is less important.\n\nA: One possibility could be to use ControllerMate.\nYou would have to create a Driver Configuration and map all of the keys to None.  Then there are multiple ways to enable/disable the custom Driver Configuration, but unfortunately CLI is currently not an option.\nBut CM is very customizable and I'm sure you could come up with something.  For example, using the logic blocks, you could have it disable when you have held down Z for 2 seconds, then hold down P and click the mouse.  Using a delay timer block to wait for 30 seconds but then only re-enable if holding the left shift key down and scrolling the mouse up/down.\nAnother similar utility that might work is Karabiner-Elements.  It is a complete rewrite of his wonderful Karabiner app which broke hard with macOS Sierra.  It is still in the early development stages but it might have the functionality you need.\n", "Q: AppleScript Text Delimiter for most recent text I have a lot of text on the file My_Note_Backup.txt\nEach time I run an another script, it added to this text something like \ndemo\ndemo\n{\ndemo demo demo\ndemo\n}\ndemo ...\n\nand this repeats around 60 times a day.\nHow can I have an AppleScript which copies only the last note in between { and }\nI have the text delimiter here, but how can I get the most recent text only?\nset theName to \"\"\nset theName to the clipboard\n\nset theText to Unicode text\nset theSource to theName\nproperty leftEdge1 : \"{\"\nproperty rightEdge2 : \"}\"\ntry\n    set saveTID to text item delimiters\n    set text item delimiters to leftEdge1\n    set classValue to text item 2 of theSource\n    set text item delimiters to rightEdge2\n    set theName to text item 1 of classValue\n    set text item delimiters to saveTID\n    theName\nend try\nset the clipboard to theName\n\nthe text file is \nset dataBackupFile to (path to desktop folder as text) & \"My_Note_Backup.txt\"\n\n\nA: There are a number of options to enable you to run a regex search in Applescript, which is probably the easiest way to do what you're looking for.

Rebooting fixes the problem.\nThis seems to be an issue some other people have had so I tried all of their solutions already (from 1 and [2]):\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\n*Setting my default shell to another shell (from /bin/zsh to /bin/sh or /bin/bash)\n\n*Removing or cleaning my .profile, .zprofile, ... This does not work and I can validate that the issue occurs before the shell is even invoked, because if I echo HEY as the first line of my .zshenv this is not even reached. It must be login causing the troubles. Editing /etc/profile to add an echo at the top also shows up nothing\n\n*Changing the Run command: setting in my Terminal config to something like echo foo also does not work (leaving Run inside shell checked or unchecked doesn't change anything).\n\n\nOther notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Like [2], ssh-add -K does not persist keys between reboots, something I never had troubles with before.\n\n*The console does not show any suspicious errors or warnings.\n\n*Opening a new Terminal window does seem to create tty file (/dev/ttys<number>).\n\n*When this occurs, it does not matter if I use Terminal.app or iTerm.app\n\n*I have a pretty clean install (just got my laptop, didn't restore any backups, just installed some apps with brew install and brew cask install).\n\n\nThis is really hard to debug because I cannot reproduce it and often I can't open a new terminal to even try to find out what's going on.\nDoes anyone have any tips?\nUpdate:\nUsing iTerm, I was able to get a shell by setting the start command to /bin/bash. In this shell, however, sudo does not work. It hangs (without showing the prompt) and ctrl-C and ctrl-D do no work when it hangs.\nUsing some other programs also does not work in this shell: node or /usr/local/bin/node both hang.

Sometimes when the machine gets in the bad state, I have open terminal windows that are already logged in successfully that I can use to debug.\nMany commands do not run properly, but they all show a pattern of having trouble writing (to stdout, I am thinking). For example, when I run ls -al, I see ls: write error emitted to stderr. When I run ls -al > /dev/null, nothing is printed to stderr.\n\nA: It's important to treat the real issue and not just the symptom. So try out the following suggestions and update so based on that can suggest further remedies as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which user owns the terminal?: My first hunch is that this can be related to how your account is set up. If terminal is trying to access the resources or directories that only the admin user can (if your's is a non admin account), then that can lead to freezing state - not allowing you to access the terminal. So go ahead and ensure when you begin a terminal session, it is local to your user and not another user. The fact that you cannot create a sudo process, is pointing me to this direction.\n\n*Type Control-Z or Command-Z: \nThis control key sequence suspends a program that may be running and gives you a shell prompt. Now you can enter the jobs command to find the program’s name, then restart the program with fg or terminate it with kill.\n\n*Press Command-C: \nThis will interrupt if the terminal is trying to run a program in the background. Try it a couple of times. Note if you see any output\n\n*Type Control-Q: \nIf output has been stopped with Control-S, this will restart it.\n\n*Get an Alternative shell: \nIf you want to try out a different shell for a few days, their behaviors may sometimes help you understand the problem with Terminal given if they act in a certain way.

I'd like to try a few things to try and get to the bottom of this for you.\n1. Confirm it hangs during login\nIf the process it's hanging at is really during login, this implies that the process is still waiting to create a login session. Assuming this is the case, then it wouldn't have tried to start the shell yet. \nTo confirm this, the next time you experience this issue launch Activity Monitor to check if the shell is running or whether you only see a login process. \nOnce you've had a chance to do this, report back with what you found.\nNOTE:- If you happen to have other terminals open, make sure you're checking the corresponding process. My guess is that the hanging process is the one with the highest Process ID (PID) number.\n2. What is the Terminal title?\nThe next time you have this issue can you take a note of what the title of the Terminal window is and report back?\n3. Kill sudo\nYou state that rebooting your MBP always resolves this issue.\nHowever, the next time you have this issue (maybe after doing what I described at 1 above), I'd like you to try killing sudo from Activity Monitor. \nOnce you've tried this, let us know what happens.\n4. Try moving your .bash* files\nIt is possible (for various reasons) you may have a .bash_profile file in your user directory and this is causing intermittent problems. This is something you may not even be aware of, but you can use Automator to run a script that finds and moves any .bash files.\nHere is an example script for doing this:\ncd ~\n\nmkdir moved\nfor F in .bash*\ndo\n    mv $F moved\ndone\n\nThis script moves all files starting with .bash in your home folder to a newly created moved subfolder. \nAfter running the script, check this folder and let us know if in fact you have any files in it.\nNOTE:- You can label the new subfolder anything you want. To do so, just change the two occurrences of moved in the script to whatever label you'd like to use.\n[UPDATE]\nSome more things to try.\n5. Try clearing the *.asl files\nIf you haven't already, try clearing out the *.asl files. To do this use the following:\nsudo rm -rf /private/var/log/asl/*.asl\n\nNOTE:- This may take some time as it creates a new shell. When complete, make sure you fully quit the Terminal for the changes to take affect.\n6. Safe Mode\nDo you notice any difference in behaviour when you start your MBP in Safe Mode? To boot into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Once your MBP starts up try using Terminal and see if you can still replicate the issue?\n\n*When finished, you can exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP as normal\n\n\n7. Open Directory\nThis probably doesn't apply in your case since you don't mention it, but if you're connected to an Open Directory network this could also be causing you problems. Usually this would only entail waiting for about 10 - 15 seconds, but I have seen reports of terminal logins taking five or more minutes to complete in this situation.\n\nA: The login command source code has been published by Apple. The website is macOS 10.13.3 Source. The only required download is system_cmds-790.30.1. Once downloaded, the project can be easily modified to only build the login command. The modified project and logincommand have been place in GitHub at davidanderson61/system_cmds-10.13.3.\nThe idea here is to modify login to write debug information to the Console. This would help determine why the login command hangs. The modifications could be made anyone wishing to participate. I assumed this would have been me.\nInstall Debug login Command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the latest release from the website davidanderson61/system_cmds-10.13.3/releases.\n\n*Download debug login command to your Downloads folder. Under \"Assets\", right click login and select \"Download Linked File As\", then select \"Save\".\n\n*Partially, disable System Integrity Protection (SIP). The command is given below. Before entering the command, you will need to boot to a macOS Recover, then a Terminal window.\ncsrutil  enable  --without  fs\n\n\n*Enter the command given below to save original login command. If login.orignal already exists, you can omit this step.\nsudo  mv  /usr/bin/login  /usr/bin/login.original\n\n\n*Enter the commands given below to copy the debug login command and set the proper permissions.\nsudo  cp  ~/Downloads/login  /usr/bin/login\nsudo  chmod  104555  /usr/bin/login\n\n\n*Enable System Integrity Protection (SIP). Enter the following command. Afterwards, you should restart.\nsudo  csrutil  clear\n\nConfigure the Console Application\nBelow are the steps to configure the Console application to show only messages from the login command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Console application.\n\n*Add a PID column, as shown below.\n\n\n*Enter login in the Search field.\n\nWhile the the Search field has focus, press the return key. The Search field should change to what is shown below. \n\n\n*Change Any to Process, as shown below.\n\n\n*List Change Contains to Equals, as shown below.\n\n\n*Select the Save button.

Attach ~/Downloads/login as a binary.\n\nA: I had this problem also while running sbt console in emacs.\nWhenever I exited out of sbt console by just killing the window instead of exiting out of sbt console \"nicely\" first, it caused a java process to hang even after the window was closed, and somehow prevented new terminal sessions from being created. I force-killed the java process from activity monitor, and the hanging terminal actually started, from within emacs as well as in a new tab.\nNow, I just make sure to quit nicely using the command exit or ctrl-d (or ctrl-c ctrl-d in emacs term/multi-term), then kill the window.\n\nA: *\n\n*Check if your process hangs really during login\n\n*Have a look on to the Activity Monitor and watch out for root processes (i.e. nano, emacs, vim) you might have initiated and not quit properly (crash, just killed the terminal, etc.) and which are still running.\n\n*Kill this process(es) and the login should work immediately.\n\n\nA: Just my two cents. \nI've installed the Terminus Package for Sublime Text, which allows me to run terminal within my text editor.\nClosing Sublime Text immediately allowed my terminal to start working again.\n\nA: FWIW, I had this same problem. It would resolve after reboot, but I wanted to save the time of doing that multiple times a day. It started after using a particular nodeJS environment, so I went into activity monitor and noticed a node process ongoing. Killing that instance solved the problem for me, so if anyone experiencing this has recently started working with node or npm locally, that could be your problem. \n\nA: Killing a stray nvim instance fixed this for me. I assume this isn't specific to nvim but something nvim in my case was doing that caused problems. I would look for an out of place orphaned terminal app in activity monitor and kill that if you find one.\n\nA: In my case, the new terminal window hung after displaying Last login: Tue Nov 24 18:31:39 on ttys001,and the title of the terminal window showed manpath.\nTurns out that this happened because I had upgraded my Xcode from 11.7 to 12.2 but hadn't yet installed the new commandline tools.  After starting Xcode and doing so, the terminal opened without problems or delays.\n", "Q: Clean user profile, every log in? I have a series of local accounts on a El Capitan (Need to stay on 10.11.6 due to app compatability). I want these accounts to get the \"default profile\" every time they log in. I mean * absolutely clean* - new desktop, downloads, settings and preferences.. I want it all gone.\nI go about this by having a logout script that simply deletes the home folder, such as:\nsudo rm -R /Users/myusername\n\nThis way the user and password is retained, but all rubbish that was left on the account is gone, and clean for the next login.\nThis works absolutely fine, except... the dock has three question marks on it when the user logs back in until the machine is rebooted. The question marks relate to three applications that are not installed on the Mac (Keynote, Pages, and Numbers). This problem happens from a clean download and install of OS X using the recovery utility.\nDoes anyone have any ideas why this might be happening? Or does anyone have another method of destroying the home folder that I can try?\n\nA: The dock is being populated with default items by way of /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/default.plist.  This is protected via SIP though.  So you can try the obvious (and non recommended) method of disabling SIP to mess with the plist.  There are other options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dockutil in a login script to add/remove/etc. whatever icons you desire.\n\n*Customize the dock as you want it to be, and copy ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist. Have a login script replace the default\ndock plist with the backup, then kill the dock and maybe cfprefsd.\n\n*Management suites, such as Casper, can manage the dock\nremotely.  \n\n\nSee https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/18357/el-capitan-user-template-dock-customisation-issue\n", "Q: WhatsApp videos are not viewable in iPhone 6s I got a video in WhatsApp from someone with an Android phone.

I am using an iPhone 6s. \n\nA: Try the free VLC video app, it's available for iOS.\n", "Q: What does the \"Run-only\" checkbox do in the Script Editor? In the Script Editor when Exporting, there is a \"Run-only\" checkbox. It is not documented in the help. What does it do?\n\nA: AppleScript .scpt files normally contain both the source code (the text you see) and compiled code (the version the computer can immediately run). These two versions are not linked in the file in any way – the file just contains both versions separately. (Text .applescript files only contain source code.)\nNormally, when you open a script in Script Editor, it ignores the compiled version and just opens the source. When you save, it compiles the source and saves both versions. \"Run-only\" means that you are only saving the compiled version, so there's no human-readable version anymore.\nYou can use run-only script in a few different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*By running it from the command line:\nosascript /path/to/script\n\n*By running it from another AppleScript:\nrun script \"path:to:script\n\n*By running one of its functions from another AppleScript:\nset myScript to load script\nmyScript's myFunc() (or myFunc() of myScript)\n\n\nDecompiling a run-only script back into source code might be hard, but a compiled script isn't completely obfuscated. During compilation, nouns and verbs are transformed into four-letter codes that AppleScript uses internally. This is easy to reverse: type «class bhit» into Script Editor and click compile → button returned. These four-letter codes can be found scattered around in compiled script files.\n\nA: \"Run-only\" saves the script in a run-only mode that disallows opening the script in the editor. If I drag a script exported as Run-only onto the open Script Editor, I get this:\n\n", "Q: Repeatedly \"trying to add a new helper tool\" on each restart for same application(s) Every time I restart my computer, it tries to \"add a new helper tool\". For instance I have to reinstall shell commands in Atom on every restart, and it prompts with the \"An update is ready to install.\"  But I see this same issue with other programs too.\nAtom installs /usr/local/bin/atom -- but then when I restart it's gone.\nI get the same thing from MAMP that it \"wants to make changes\".\nAnd Slack gives me the same thing as Atom on every restart:\n\n\nAn update is ready to install. Slack is trying to add a new helper tool.\nEnter an administrator's name and password to allow this.\nAdd Helper\n\nLet me know what other information I can give.\n\nA: Try changing the ownership of Atom.app. In my case, Atom.app was found in /Applications, and ownership was:\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 1699963712  365896978    102 Dec  8 12:48 Atom.app\n\nI ran the following command (-R means operate recursively):\nsudo chown -R ${USER}:wheel /Applications/Atom.app\n\nThis changes the owner to the currently logged-in user and the group to wheel.\nIn my case, any program with ownership of root or the numeric code listed above would have a popup a few seconds after opening. Changing ownership of the .app directory corrected the behavior and I don't see it anymore.\nI found the information at this site.\nNote: on newer Mac OS versions, like 13, you could get operation not permitted errors. To remedy that, be sure to enable Full Disk Access for Terminal from System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access, and try again.\n\nA: Searching for the application and manually dragging it into the Applications folder also worked for me.\n\nA: Here's my solution: run any OS X atom-based apps such as Slack or Signal out of your ~/Applications directory.\nThe root of the problem is that these apps were installed system-wide via a mechanism like Homebrew, or manually by you and owned by root. So the easy/quick workaround is to copy them to a place where your current user has write access:\nkillall Slack && rsync -av --delete /Applications/Slack.app/ ~/Applications/Slack.app/ && open ~/Applications/Slack.app\n\nNow when the atom application's built-in update mechanism tries to write to its files, it can!

I think my macOS works in some debug mode, but I'm not sure, because when I open Console, I see a lot of log entries every second, despite not doing much. If I enabled that mode, I don't remember how it was enabled. There are some entries regarding memory allocation,  and some other.\nBefore I didn't see so much logs, unless it's a Sierra thing.\nI don't have any extras in boot-args section when running: nvram -p.\nHere is the example:\n\nHow do I lower the verbosity of my logs? Or such thing is expected?\nI'm aware that I can filter the logs by choosing Errors and Faults, but this is not what I'm looking for.\n\nA: No, reducing verboseness of the macOS logs is not a standard option.\nWhile there may be a Terminal command/flag or a mod GUI app that lets you change the error levels recorded, I'd advise against doing so because if and when you need support/help, the console logs will be one of the places a tech person would review, and if they're truncated then there's less clues for the person investigating an issue.\n\nA: You can change the system-wide logging settings with log(1).\nsudo log config --mode \"level: error\"\n\n…should limit logging to error-level messages only.\nI have not tested this, and I would advise against it.  Rather use the log command in collaboration with the Console application to filter only the messages you want to see.\n\nA: I also experience this and most of the log messages look completely uninteresting and I am wondering if that write operations are bad for the flash storage in the long run...\n", "Q: How to remove automatically subscribed calendar for public holidays on my iPhone? As you can see in the screenshot below, somehow my iPhone subscribed to a calendar which is called \"Deutsche Feiertage\" (German public holidays).\nHow can I find out where this is coming from and how can I remove it (not just hide or disable notification)?\n\nI am not hundert percent sure, but I think it is there since I upgraded my Mac to macOS 10.12. It was also there in the calendar app. There it was really easy to delete it. But I cannot find I way to get rid of it on my iPhone (using iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 10.2).\n\nA: You can't delete the iOS holidays calendar, only hide it. It is a subscribed calendar but it's part of iOS.\n\nA: Open your calendar, at the bottom center of your screen select \"Calendars\":\n\nGo down to \"Holidays in the US\" and deselect the check mark on the left side of your screen:\n\nYou're done!\n\n\nA: Change your iOS region to Italy:\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*General\n\n*Language & Region\n\n*Region\n\n(This is for iOS 14)\nI don’t know why, but it looks like Italy does not enforce a subscribed Italian holiday calendar.

I don't want my photos automatically 'tagged' by iOS. How do i disable this?\n\nA: Apple did not give us a way to opt-out of the image analysis and the only way to avoid it is to move your photos off of the iOS device.\nMaybe good to know. All image analysis is done on device and never leaves your device.\n\nApple’s system is more focused on privacy than Facebook's or Google’s,\n  with stricter limits on how the data is collected and stored. Onstage,\n  Federighi insisted that Apple’s new system only uses local data, which\n  means the company isn’t storing faceprints on company servers — a\n  crucial point for anyone worried about their faceprint being used for\n  more than just cataloging photos. Faceprints are still being created\n  and used, but it's all happening on your phone, where Apple and the\n  rest of the world can't access it. That’s different from Google and\n  Facebook, which store data on the cloud and get significant scale\n  benefits as a result.\n\nSource: Apple's new facial recognition feature could spur legal issues - The Verge\nWhat you can do to ensure more privacy is to not name the detected faces and to merge all detected faces into one single people album. This will prevent Photos from identifying more photos of the same persons.  Then hide the people album. Then the persons will not be used in Memories.\n\nA: I still don't trust it.  The fact that Apple chose and continues choosing to disallow users the option to turn it off is extremely suspect and a colossal privacy risk, and speaks volumes.  Even if it's true that under normal circumstances the facial data doesn't leave the phone by design, that doesn't meant it can't leave the phone by other means and be misused.  For that reason, I have mitigated facial recognition (iOS 11).  It requires a jailbreak, however.  I actually made a decision to buy iPhone X only after I verified that (1) I could jailbreak it, (2) specifically for the purpose of being able to disable facial profiling.  Had I not been able to verify this before-hand, I would have gone with a non-Apple phone because Apple gives us no way to turn off the \"feature.\"\nI set up a cron job on my phone that runs every 15 minutes and, in essence, executes against Photos.sqlite, a \"delete from [table name],\" iterating through tables including, but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*zdeferredrebuildface\n\n*zdetectedface\n\n*zdetectedfacegroup\n\n*zdetectedfaceprint\n\n*zperson\n\n\n...and as well manipulates *face* and *person* indicies.\n", "Q: Where are these ads on my lock-screen coming from and how can I get rid of it? Every time when I am close to an \"dm market\" (a German drugstore) I am getting this advertisement on my lock-screen. When I open this notification it looks like in the second screenshot below. There is no app for \"dm\" or the related service \"PAYBACK\" installed on my phone. I used the app in the past but it is no longer on my device.\nFirst of all I would like to understand where is this coming from? And second how can I disable this kind of stuff?\n\n\n\nA: I just experienced the same thing, although with a different coupon and app. For me, it turns out that it is coming from the 'Wallet' app. If it is, go to the 'Wallet' app, click on the coupon, then the 'i' on the bottom left. You can select 'Remove Pass' and that should get rid of it. \n", "Q: Inverting mouse axis using Karabiner Karabiner seems like an extremely versatile piece of software, but I can't seem to find a way to invert the mouse axis with it. For example: When I move the mouse downwards I want the cursor to go upwards, and when I move the mouse to the right, I want the cursor to go left.(*)\nRight now I'm using USB Overdrive for this purpose, but I need Karabiner for other stuff, and it would be nice if I could get away with just one program.\n(*) This sounds so strange that I feel I owe you an explanation: I have a trackball mouse which, due to it's form factor forces me to turn it 180 degrees on my desk. By inverting the axis in software, it still moves naturally.\n\nA: To flip cursor movement you can use a third party tool: Karabiner. Karabiner isn't compatible with Sierra at the time of writing (January 2017).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and open Karabiner\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences\n\n*Open the tab Misc & Uninstall\n\n*Hit the button Open private.xml\n\n*Open the file private.xml with an appropriate editor\n\n*Enter the customized keycode\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n    <item>\n    <name>3rd-Party Pointing Device</name>\n    <item>\n        <name>Reverse Vertical &amp; Horizontal Cursor Movement</name>\n        <identifier>reverse.mouse.movement</identifier>\n        <autogen>\n          __FlipPointingRelative__\n          Option::FLIPPOINTINGRELATIVE_HORIZONTAL,\n          Option::FLIPPOINTINGRELATIVE_VERTICAL,\n        </autogen>\n    </item>\n    </item>\n</root>\n\nIf you already have other items in private.xml omit the first two and the last line of the above code.\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences the tab Change Key\n\n*Hit the ReloadXML button\n\n*Enable the remapping. It should be listed at the beginning.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a second pointing device (i.e. an Apple mouse or a trackpad) and want to use it normally, you have to restrict the mod to your trackball mouse by adding a devicevendordef/deviceproductdef somewhere and a device tag after the identifier tag in your private.xml. Example (sorry, only an Apple external keyboard):\n<devicevendordef>\n    <vendorname>Apple</vendorname>\n    <vendorid>0x05ac</vendorid>\n</devicevendordef>\n<deviceproductdef>\n    <productname>ExternalKeyboard</productname>\n    <productid>0x0256</productid>\n</deviceproductdef>\n...\n<device_only>DeviceVendor::Apple, DeviceProduct::ExternalKeyboard</device_only>\n\nYou get the various device IDs by opening Karabiner > Misc. & Uninstall > EventViewer > Devices\n", "Q: Late 2015 iMac 27 freezes than crashes and restarts - often and apparently randomly I purchased this late 2015 iMac 27 with built in 8GB of memory in September of 2016.  Shortly thereafter I replaced the original memory with Adamanta 32GB (4x8GB) Apple Memory Upgrade for Late 2015 iMac 27\" DDR3L 1867Mhz PC3-14900 SODIMM 2Rx8 CL13 1.35v RAM from Amazon.  I also cloned my internal drive to an external SSD drive, and use that as the startup disk.\nEverything worked fine along with significantly better performance.  I did however, start experiencing freezes, and after 20 seconds or so, a reboot.  These appear to be random, although mostly while using a web browser - usually Safari, and they continue to this day.  I may go a week or so without a crash, but sometimes I get several in one day.\nNot sure if this would have happened without the third party additions as they were done about a week after purchase.  I suppose I could reinstall the original memory, and possibly clone back to the internal drive and see what happens.  But the computer is still under warranty, and I purchased Applecare+ (something I wouldn't have done in the past, but my own experience with a MacBook Pro and friends' experiences with Apple products, it seems they're not what they used to be) so I figured I'd take it straight to the Apple Store.  I saw this site and decided to give it a try before I do that though.\nI'm running under El Capitan version 10.11.6.\nThanks for any ideas or suggestions.\n\nA: You used a different type of RAM than specified by Apple. It's a small difference, but it is possible that it caused the effect you are describing. You purchased this RAM:\n\nDDR3L 1867Mhz PC3-14900 SODIMM 2Rx8 CL13 1.35v RAM\n\nApple's site specifies this RAM:\n\nPC3-14900 Unbuffered Nonparity 204-pin 1867MHz DDR3 SDRAM\n\nWhat's the difference?\nIt's DDR3 vs DDR3L.\nThe \"L\" stands for low powered. Standard Apple RAM, and replacement RAM from sites such as OWC, operate at 1.5V. Your DDR3L RAM operates on 1.35V.\n\nA: How long did everything work fine? Days? Weeks? Months? \nI doubt the HDD->SSD change had any effect. The RAM, however..... Apple computers are quite picky about RAM. I would try putting the original RAM back in and see if the random freezes/crashes/reboots go away entirely or even diminish noticeably.\nIf so, return the RAM for Kingston or Crucial brand RAM. I've had better experience with those brands, myself.\nYou might have some pushback regarding your AppleCare warranty since you opened the system to change the HDD to a SSD.\n", "Q: How can I screen record iPhone and Android screen at the same time visible right next to each other?

Maybe you can use QuickTime for the iPhone and the options on this link for the Android. Then export the Android video.\nhttp://www.hongkiat.com/blog/android-screen-recording-apps/\n\nA: The best way to do this is to take two video recordings, one of the iPhone doing its 'bits' and one of the Android phone doing its 'bits'.\nIt sounds like you're familiar with QuickTime for the iPhone side of things, but for the Android side just do a search for screen recorder on the Google Play Store. You should see many options (both free and paid).\nOnce you have the two videos, use a video editor (such as iMovie on your MacBook) to edit the two videos into one to achieve the effect you're after.\n", "Q: Photos sync from iTunes mac osx to iOS/iPhone location unknown? I transferred some videos from my Mac OS X Photos using iTunes app to my iPhone/iOS. I pressed Sync and it worked on transferring it to my iPhone. On my Mac OS X iTunes, the free storage for my iPhone reduced after the sync so I have some clue that transfer did happen. However, I don't where exactly in my iPhone are those videos transferred and how to access them?\n\nA: The places to check would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos app (Camera Roll)\n\n*Movies/Videos app (if you're on iOS 9 or earlier; this app is gone in iOS 10)\n\n*Cloud Photo Library\n\n", "Q: app won't run when DVD is inserted I have an older iMac running El Capitan.  I want to run a shell script when a DVD is inserted.  I used Script Editor to create an Applescript that runs the shell script.

It appears that this feature just doesn't work at all.\n\nA: I restarted my system and now this is working, it's invoking my app when the DVD is inserted.  There's nothing in the instructions suggesting that a restart is required, but that seems to be the key to making this working.

So, if your CSV file looked like this:\nred,apple\nyellow,banana\ngreen,pickle\nbrown,desk\nwhite,sock\n\nIt would be converted it to this:\n{{red,apple},{yellow,banana},{green,pickle},{brown,desk},{white,sock}}\n\nThen it is easy to loop through the list and find the first item whose first item matches the search term. For example if I'm searching for \"brown\" I would find \"brown\" in item 4 of the larger list, and then pick off item 2 of item 4 of the larger list, resulting in \"desk.\"\nHere is a script that asks you to choose a CSV file, then asks you for the search term (the thing you want to find in Column A). It then displays the Column B value in a dialog box. This may not completely solve your problem, but it does answer your question regarding searching a CSV file using AppleScript and not Excel or Numbers.\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set the_file to choose file\n    end tell\n\n    set my_data to read the_file\n    set my_list to paragraphs of my_data as list\n    -- we need to make a list of lists... each item in my_list needs to be a list of two items.\n    set new_list to {}\n    -- this is housekeeping\n    set oldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \",\"\n    -- /housekeeping\n    --\n    --make the list look right\n    repeat with an_item in my_list\n    -- inserting \"try\" statement to catch blank lines\n    try\n        set x to text item 1 of an_item\n        set y to text item 2 of an_item\n        set component_list to {x, y}\n        set end of new_list to component_list\n    end try\n    end repeat\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to olddelims\n\n    -- now you have a list with each item in the list\n    -- being Columns A and B of one line in the CSV file\n    --\n    -- Bringing Finder to the front to make dialog boxes show more easily\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n      activate\n      set the_search_term to display dialog \"What are you looking for?\" default answer \"red\"\n      set the_search_term to text returned of the_search_term\n\n      repeat with some_item in new_list\n          if item 1 of some_item is the_search_term then\n              display dialog \"Column B value is: \" & item 2 of some_item\n              return\n          end if\n      end repeat\n    end tell\n\n\nA: I've rewritten the script to be much more efficient (and a LOT faster). I thought it would be useful to see the original as well as this one so I am posting this as a second answer.\nIt's a different approach.

So I have an iPad Mini First Generation that is currently jailbroken using Pangu. It is currently on 7.1.2 and I want to upgrade it to 9.0.2, but not the latest, which is 9.3.5. I've heard about using BLOBs and unsigned IPSWs but I'm not sure what to do. Could someone shed some light on me?\nThanks!\n\nA: The short answer is, you can't.\nFirst, for the most part, using SHSH blobs to install an unsigned version of iOS hasn't worked since iOS 6. There have been some recent developments with a tool called Prometheus, but it will only work on more recent versions — at the moment, that basically means iOS 10, though I am greatly simplifying the situation.\nSecond, though it's a moot point, you would need to already have saved the SHSH blobs for 9.0.2 while it was being signed/while your device was running 9.0.2.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Wine?

I have shot some video footage using two iPhones from two different vantage points for doing motion capture of a human figure. In order for this to work I need to do camera-matching in my 3D software. In order to do the camera-matching I'm searching for the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 7's focal length (after cropping for stabilization)\n\n*iPhone 7's sensor width and height (Update: 1/3\" sensor = 4.80 x 3.60 mm)\n\n\nNote that the iPhone 7 in question is not a Plus (so it has just one camera). Note also that this is for video footage, and that while shooting video the iPhone crops the frame slightly to compensate for stabilization. My understanding is that this results in a longer focal length. I've read that on iPhone 5 the result is a 4.1mm focal length instead of 4mm (or 4.027777~ to be precise... I think). Not sure if this is the same for iPhone 7.\nSo, I have the following specs for the iPhone 5, in case that helps determine those of the 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5's focal length: 4.1mm (after cropping for stabilization)\n\n*iPhone 5's sensor: 4.54 x 3.42 mm\n\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\nP.S.

I'd be surprised if it's the latter, since it's less than three years old, sits untouched next to my router in a well-ventilated area, and again the diagnostics reported no issues.\n\nA: It could be a corrupt file on your Mac, rather than a problem with the external drive. If it is you can open console via launchpad, and search for error messages related to \"backup\". If there's a line with something about \"SrcErr\" and \"Copying\" and a filename, that will point you to the corrupt file.

Only locally connected drives appear there. As per this answer on Apple's forum site, the way to check your hard drive for errors is to connect it directly to your Mac using USB, FireWire or Thunderbolt. Then you can repair or erase it with Disk Utility. If this hard-wire connection is not an option, you may want to consider erasing the old backup and creating a new backup.\n", "Q: \"Today summary\" widget in notification centre displays strange behaviour I have upgraded from El Capitan to Sierra a couple of weeks ago.

This only appears when the headphones are NOT plugged in. Also I am unable to get a sound notification for mail or messages. I think these are related problems.\n\nA: The headphone symbol is shown when you are connected to Bluetooth headphones/speakers, which would be true if you have a Bluetooth device auto-connecting (which would not be used when you plug in headphones). Go to Settings → Bluetooth and see which device you are connected to, and disconnect if you wish. Sound notifications will be routed to this device so that is why you do not hear them.\nIf you no longer want to use Bluetooth to connect to these particular headphones/speakers (i.e. you only want to use a cable) you can also forget the device in the same settings by tapping on the info symbol  and selecting Forget this Device.

When you notice users bending the cables two months after you issue them is when you need to train the users to not crimp/bend the cables (to budget for users that are hard on the equipment so you have spares on hand when they break them).\n\n*There are no aftermarket MagSafe adapters made to better specifications or materials than Apple's  - only cheaper knock off and imitation or just less solid but well designed and built. You would need to armor or stiffen the cables before they fail with added material if you don't want to train users.\n\n\nIf your users are breaking the accessories, you'll want to train them and explain how tightly wrapping or always bending the cord in the same exact spot will break down the materials faster than if they spread the bends across a larger area or just keep the bend radius larger as opposed to a sharp right angle bend.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.wired.com/2013/12/tnhyui-macbook-powercord-wrapping/\nNote the loop and the straight cable on both the MagSafe end and the power brick end. Also, note that Apple has ditched this design in favor of easily replaceable USB C cords so people that are hard on cables won't need power adapters going forward - just cable replacements.\n", "Q: How to get videos and music in the same screen? The last version of iTunes I liked was around 2010 when I had all my music and videos in the one menu list. Now if I want to change to videos from music I have to go to the dropdown tab (via mouse) at the top of the page.

I would take some time and learn how to create .plist XML files for lauchd and use that service instead of cron \n\nA: You think you need to use sudo.  You don't.  You're not trying to empty root's Trash folder. You have permission to delete files in your own ~/.Trash folder, so you don't need to become root (which is what sudo does) to do the rm.\nYou can simply use:\n* * * * * rm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nNote, I'd also advise against using ~ in a dangerous command like this (any time you're calling rm -rf it's potentially dangerous).

This is most likely caused by not having the necessary graphics drivers installed.\nInstall a driver providing OpenGL 2.0 or higher, or, if this is not possible, make sure the ANGLE Open GL ES 2.0 Emulation libraries (libEGL.dll, libGLESv2.dll, and d3dcompiler_*.dll) are available in the application executable's directory or in a location listed in PATH.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can upgrade the drivers for Apple's AMD FirePro D700 (which appear to be at \"FireGL V\") to something supporting OpenGL 2.0?\n\nA: use at your own risk but bootcampdrivers.com may have a solution for you...\n", "Q: MacBook as audio source for iPhone USB compatible speakers Is it possible to output sound from a MacBook via USB to an iPhone/iPod compatible speaker (the speaker has an USB input that only works with iPhones), maybe making the Mac output sound through USB the way the iPhone does?\n\nA: You can output Mac sound via USB by changing the settings in Sound. Connect the USB speaker, then open System Preferences. Select Sound. There are three 'tabs' in this window: Sound Effects, Output, Input. Select Output. You may see your speakers, or perhaps \"USB audio CODEC\". Choose either one.  Sound will come out of the USB speakers.\n\nA: Without the devices to test, it's hard to say. \nI do know that iPhones have a specific signal they send - for example, in my truck, there's a USB port to play music that only works with iPhones and iPod Touch devices - Android and even my MacBook read as unsupported devices. \nIt would be able to connect via Bluetooth though - out of the options you mentioned, that may be the best. \n\nA: Sending audio over USB is certainly possible, there are USB-based headsets on the market which require exactly that. Whether a given speaker supports this depends on the model though, please consult the manual (or contact the vendor).\n", "Q: Start Terminal application as separate app I want to use WeeChat on my MacBook. In a dream world I want to be able to launch it using Spotlight, and then preferably it will open a Terminal window that is not tied to Terminal. When I Command + Tab it will have its own separate icon. It would be preferable to have it act as if it is another application than Terminal, as I usually have a lot of Terminal windows open.\nI assume I have to write custom plist-files (if it is even possible), but I am kind of stuck currently.\nIs there a way?\n\nA: You could download something like iTerm - it's a different (free) application entirely that acts as a terminal replacement with different UI options. In my experience it behaves exactly like Terminal with its own configuration, so it might be easier than creating a special instance. \n", "Q: Some photos aren't displayed when iPhone connected to PC I have an issue where when I connect my iPhone (6S) to my PC via USB in an attempt to transfer photos, only some photos are displayed in the folders.\nThis isn't to do with the phone being locked (it isn't) or needing to tap  the \"Trust this computer\" option on the iPhone when it is connected.\nSome photos are displayed and I can copy them from the device to my PC, but some, which are clearly displayed in iOS Photos, simply aren't there when I browse the file structure under the (the phone's name) > Internal Storage > DCIM > 100APPLE (etc).\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the iPhone\n\n*Restarting the computer\n\n*Using a different USB port\n\n*Connecting to a different computer\n\n\nI can also see the photos in question on iCloud and I can download them from there, but the reason I want to get them from the iPhone is that I also want the .AAE files.\n\nA: After much frustration, Googling and trial-and-error, I came to the conclusion that the photos displayed on my phone weren't actually on my phone, but were instead \"optimised versions\" of photos stored in iCloud and therefore inaccessible through the file structure when connected to my PC.\n(It should be noted that the photos did not appear pixelated or blurry in any way in the Photos app on my phone, but the following solution worked which indicates to me that these were \"optimised versions\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Settings > iCloud > Photos on the iPhone\n\n*If \"Optimise iPhone Storage\" is selected, you have solved your problem:  this means that some photos appearing on your phone are in fact stored in iCloud\n\n*Select the option \"Download and Keep Originals\" - this will ensure all photos are actually stored on your phone, meaning they will appear when connected to a PC via USB.\n\n\nNote: You may find that selecting this option results in a message that your phone lacks the necessary capacity to download originals of all your photos. I had to work in stages, allowing my phone to download the originals which I then copied to my PC and deleted from my phone, creating more space for more originals to be downloaded.\n", "Q: Permanently Delete IMAP Account I'm unable to permanently delete an IMAP account under MacOS 10.12.2.\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the account from System Preferences > Internet Accounts removes it, the entry in Mail,and the related keychain item, but they all reappear after several seconds.\n\n*Using Keychain Access to remove the related keychain item achieves the same frustrating result.\n\n*Disabling iCloud Keychain allows removal of the offending account, but it returns when iCloud Keychain is reenabled.\n\n*Repeatedly resetting iCloud Keychain according to Apple's instructions hasn't helped.

Smarter solutions are welcome.\n\n\nYou can list all options with this command.\nbrew options target_formula\n\nAnd you can get all --with-* options with this.\nbrew options target_formula | grep 'with-'\n\nSo you can install a formula with all --with-* options by this.\nbrew install target_formula `brew options target_formula | grep 'with-'`\n\nNote that some formula, especially in unofficial tap, can have old options not prefixed with --with- or --without.\n\n\nEDIT:\nIf you want to exclude specific option, for example --with-zimg, you can do that with this.\n(grep -v 'with-zimg' is fine, but grep -v 'zimg' is shorter)\nbrew install target_formula `brew options target_formula | grep 'with-' | grep -v 'zimg'`\n\n\nA: There is no wildcard-expansion mechanism for arguments in Homebrew, so the possibility to select all options, would depend on the implementation of each formula.\nLooking at the ffmpeg formula code, each option is handled individually, so it is not possible using the current version.\nYou would have to modify the formula removing the conditionals in lines like:\nargs << \"--enable-chromaprint\" if build.with? \"chromaprint\"\n\nOr add a global switch for all arguments; or change the logic to install all by default and make the switches for disabling options.\n", "Q: Why does only half my monitor light up sometimes Sometimes when I wake my MacBook Pro (late 2013) from sleep I only get the right half of the screen lighting up while the left is dark with a hard line dividing the halves (see image below). I can fix this by power-cycling the monitor but its annoying. Can anyone tell me what is happening and how I might fix it? My monitor is a 32 inch Samsung and I have a dual HDMI cable connecting it to my MacBook.\n\n\nA: There are three possible causes in a situation like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*An issue with the MacBook Pro\n\n*An issue with the monitor\n\n*A faulty cable\n\n\nTrying to identify the problem involves a process of elimination and some patience.\n1. MacBook Pro\nAs a starting point I would reset both the SMC and NVRAM of your MacBook Pro.\nRESET SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nRESET NVRAM\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer. \n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nThere may be other things to try (e.g. changing screen resolution, changing mode, etc) but I'd reset the SMC and NVRAM first and try using the monitor as usual to see if that resolves the issue.\n2. Monitor\nYou don't specify your exact model of Samsung monitor, but regardless of model you will be able to reset the monitor. The instructions for doing so will be in your manual. \nMost recent Samsung monitors can be reset by holding down the Source button for about 20 seconds, while older models will have specific instructions. If you don't have your manual, accessing the monitor's Menu and browsing the options should provide a reset option. In some cases you may need to do multiple resets (e.g. Geometry reset, Colour reset, etc).\nYou can also try changing some of the monitor's other settings to determine what difference this makes.\n3. Cable\nTesting for a faulty cable is straightforward as it simply involves trying another cable. However, unless you happen to have access to a spare cable, I would try the above steps for your MacBook Pro and monitor first.\n", "Q: Cannot see or delete photos from \"Synced from iTunes Library\" I have an iPhone 6S and Windows PCs.

I have a 2011 Macbook Pro (with a SSD and 16GB RAM upgrade) that I'm very happy with, but it's aging, some ports aren't working anymore, etc., so I'm in the market for a new device.\nI do some amount of print design with Adobe CC, and web app/mobile app development. I seem to be pushing the 2011 MBP to the boundaries quite often: it will frequently (and annoyingly) start running its fans are when I work on complex, 500+-MB documents in Adobe CC, and when I code using Visual Studio (with npm, some linters, and usually an iPhone or Android simulator running at the same time). \nMy favourite new choice would be a 13\" MBP (2015 or '16) but I worry about missing out on the performance edge that the 15\" MBP offers with its quad-core processors and discrete graphics units (in some models).  GeekBench has a clear opinion on which device class is more powerful, but do those benchmarks really apply 100% to the type of work I do? How important is processor speed for me? Is a discrete GPU really that relevant when doing relatively run-off-the-mill print design rather than video? Does a multi-core configuration really make a difference when the main goal is avoiding the system from heating up and running the fans? (I'm happy with most of the 2011 MBP's speed - the fans are the real annoyance.) \nAre there more comprehensive benchmarks out there that allow for a performance comparison that is more tailored to specific fields of work?\n\nA: You have most of what you need to optimize for listed in the second paragraph:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe CC - lags with larger documents\n\n*Adobe CC and Visual Studio - together with iOS/Android simulators\n\n\nFor these items, you'll want to fire up Activity Monitor and or the terminal to figure out what is the bottleneck. Is it RAM / virtual memory swapping to storage or is it purely CPU and thread execution waiting or is the GPU incapable of helping with some of the workload.\n\n\n*\n\n*Two terminal windows with iostat running - one over a 60 second cycle and the other over a 1 second measurement window will let you know how bursty your IO is and whether you need IOPS or need bandwidth out of your storage. (My guess is you need iops - unless you are streaming / editing 4k video). Also, a third window with top -u -s 60 can correlate the load averages you see on iostat 60 with the CPU usage and what apps are really hitting the CPU.\n\n\nNext, figure out how much RAM you really need - when you have all the apps open and the simulators - is your memory pressure in yellow or still in green. For most people in your case - money spent on more than 8 GB of RAM is usually better spent elsewhere on a faster CPU or more storage or new app upgrades or AppleCare. Even our Mac Pro / iMac 27 inch developers that run development and heavy Adobe apps are finding it hard to justify more than 16 GB of RAM when we measure actual workloads on machines that run 8 hours a shift - three shifts a day. \nOnce you know where your current workflow is hanging up, you can make a better judgement if you will be delighted with NVMe+PCI storage over the old and slower SATA/AHCI storage. My workload is similar to you and I have a 6 core MacPro (current model) with tons of RAM, a maxed out RAM/CPU 15 inch MacBook Pro with GPU and thunderbolt 2 ports (the last rev before the TB3 models) and a 2015 MacBook (NVMe storage and i3 / 1.1 GHz CPU and one USB C port) and I choose to do the vast majority of my work on the MacBook.\n\n\n*\n\n*for example, compiling mongodb from source (repeat time brew reinstall mongodb --build-from-source two or three times) my MacPro gets the job done in 9m26s using 12 threads, the MacBook Pro takes 11m7s using 8 threads, the MacBook takes 41m25s to compile. The MacBook will run into thermal stress and slow down, but it's rare I have such a large full compile to run and incremental builds are the normal for me.\n\n\nYes the others can compile large software faster in benchmarks and Adobe runs a little faster on the large files, but I'm almost never waiting for the machines and I need to take my work with me and the hassle of lugging the 15 inch due to it's physical size and added weight (power brick, adapters, and the CPU/Display) are far more a downside than the few times I can do something a little faster. I'm totally going to upgrade to the 13 inch TouchBar model when the 2017 capital budget hits and decide if I even need to keep the MacBook.\nI wouldn't look at any benchmark and instead just measure your actual workload and optimize for that. The truth is - any new MacBook with a touch bar is going to be better for you than anything Apple Sells unless you want to get a 27 inch iMac for max CPU/RAM. In practice, the NVMe storage makes your real life performance great and covers up for any measurable benchmark differences. I'm also not a fan of GPU in the MacBook line - the software glitches you suffer occasionally and the extra drain on the battery never seem to make me happy as a trade off for some limited faster filters in Photoshop or a 3D render that takes 5 minutes instead of 7 to 10.\n", "Q: How to reconnect to Airport Extreme hard drive without rebooting I put a mac formatted hard drive on my export extreme.

Is it possible to find all those applications using a Finder search query?\n\nA: The simplest way is to go to the Apple Menu -> \"About this Mac...\", then click \"System Report\". In the window that shows up, you can scroll to the Software section, and click \"Applications\".  Apps from the Mac App Store are listed as such.\nIn the screen shot, Skitch was downloaded from the Mac App Store.\n\nA: The screenshot below shows how to use a Finder search query to find all applications that are not from the App Store. The “Raw Query” condition is kMDItemAppStoreHasReceipt != 1. This is the same, I think, as testing for a directory named “_MASReceipt” as in the answer by patrix. But using a Finder search query should be easier for people not comfortable with using Terminal.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Applications from the store are installed in /Applications (at least by default), so any applications outside of that folder are not from the store.\n\n*Applications from the store have a NAME.app/Contents/_MASReceipt folder, so you could use (in Terminal)\ncd /Applications\nfor i in *.app; do\n    [[ -d \"$i/Contents/_MASReceipt\" ]] || echo $i\ndone\n\nto find all non-store applications\n", "Q: My favorite edit button of safari is missing \n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Side bar icon in the upper left corner of Safari.\n\n*Select the bookmarks icon.\n\n*Open the Favorites section by clicking on the arrow.\n\n*Click Edit.\nWhere is the \"EDIT\" button?  \nHelp me please!\n\nA: You may be a victim of Apple changing functionality of Safari features.

Trying to play Quatrian's multiplayer app \"FaceMe Backgammon\" between an iOS9 and an iOS10 client. How can I get these two to connect since the changes to the Game Center and iMessage?\nFWIW, the two are able to play Zynga's \"Words with Friends\" but that doesn't require the Game Center.\nThe iOS9 device sends invites to the emil and Game Center username of the iOS10 device, but they are not received.\nThe iOS 10 device has the Settings > Game Center but does not have an invite option.\nThe two can txt w/iMessage, but the iOS9 only has \"Message\".app (the green one, which receives iMessage - blue - data) and doesn't receive iOS10's iMessage invites.\nThe in-app multiplayer options are limited to Game Center \"friends\" but does not have the option of inviting.\nThe email response I got from the people at Quatrian deferred to their \"tips\" page (which does not address iOS10) and these fairly useless links:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5007662?tstart=0\nhttp://appletoolbox.com/2015/10/ios-9-game-center-not-working-blank-page-fix/\n\nA: Well, after a bunch of back and forth with the Quatrain folks, I finally heard this from them:\n\nAfter a lot of investigation, it looks like there is no simple way to\n  add friends between iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices. We will be working to\n  integrate the new iOS 10 Game Center functionality, but it won't be\n  ready for a while as Apple made some drastic changes to the Game\n  Center functionality.\nAs a workaround, you can play the Auto-match games and if you select\n  the Auto-Match Length of 5, you are almost guaranteed to only play\n  each-other as most players don't use that option.\n\nMy friend and I tried the simultaneous \"Auto-Match Length of 5\" option and were able to play backgammon together. While playing there are \"send friend\" invite options but mine \"went out\" to who knows where and theirs (iOS10) at least gave a message saying not available.\nSo, sounds like there's some work to do for app developers to maintain the new style of Apple's Game Center functionality with non-iOS10 devices.\n", "Q: I've broken my new MacBook Pro (with touchbar) like this, do I have to repair it? I am not sure whether this is a good question for this place. But I'd still like to have a try. It's anyway an \"Apple question\". If it's not a good place, I hope someone can let me know where should I go.\nHere is my question:\nI've broken my new MBP (the 2016 version with touchbar) like this:\n\nHere is a high-quality photo:\n\nDo I HAVE TO have it repaired?\nI'm living in a place far away from Apple Store in the city so I'd like to get some online help before I make the decision to drive to downtown.\nThanks very much for any kind of tips.\n\nA: I would try to make it to an Apple Store before the 1 year AppleCare coverage expires.\nBut you don't HAVE to repair that. I know someone who put a piece of scotch tape over their cracked glass touchpad and is still using their computer. \nI would at least tape it up so the cracks have a harder time expanding. \n\nA: That is the glass cover not the actual screen.  At the bottom the screen is not behind the glass as room is required for the connectors.\nThe glass is not likely to crack and very little dust will get in. Dust would not harm the screen.  But cover it with tape would still be a good practice.\nThe glass alone is not very expensive but I will would not bother to replace it.\nThe labor cost is more than the cost of the glass and replaced is never better than the original install.\nIf you need to replace the screen then go ahead and replace the glass at that time.\n\nA: You certainly don't need to repair it unless you can't use the device. It's a minor safety hazard until you contain any broken glass, but gravity or a toothpick to dislodge any fragments and then some clear tape should handle that. If you want to put a little black electrical tape over the aluminum inside and then use thin clear tape to make the surface smooth - that would be the advanced level patch I'd recommend.\nNeither the one year warranty nor AppleCare extension / expansion of the warranty is intended to cover that sort of damage, but I would still call Apple's phone or web support if you aren't going to be in the area of a store in the next week. Ask Apple what your options are, but be prepared if they don't offer to pay to repair the damage.\nOnce you have a quote (assuming it's not covered), check with your form of payment. Many US credit cards come with accident protection for new purchases - you might be covered under some sort of protection / insurance to pay whatever cost Apple might charge to repair it.\nAt that point, you can revisit if you're OK with the tape covering it and know what your options are if the cracks spread or if the hinges were damaged when the pressure built up before the glass gave in and cracked. I don't think that's the case since your photos show that the glass had no backing right where your item was placed and there's no evidence of deformation on the aluminum - so this might be a oops you can live with if you don't want to pay the cost for a new display repair and everything else works properly. All indications are this is cosmetic damage and can be patched well enough to keep further dust from invading the display housing if there's even a path from that lower cover to the main display space.\n", "Q: Preview in full screen mode has scrollbars I'm on MacOS 10.12.2.

How can I get rid of these scrollbars, seeing as the entire page fits fine.\nThe same thing seems to be happening when the PDF first opens, so maybe that's a clue:\n\n\nA: In  > System Preferences > General, set \"Show scroll bars\" to \"When scrolling\" (or, if you're not using a mouse, \"Automatically based on mouse or trackpad\").

Now, it's highly likely you won't have a problem with documents, pictures, movies and music.  However, there may be a setting (file) for an application that is causing the issue.  \nIf after a copy, things go awry, you will have narrowed down where the offending file is.\nAll in all, the solution was and is to create a new user account.\n", "Q: Does Whatsapp Save Incoming Media feature create duplicates?

I was adding some new songs in Itunes then I connected the Phone to those songs.\nUnfortunately as soon as Iphone connected to iTunes, it automatically made a full back-up of my phone, and I now can't see the previous back-up I made. Please tell me!\nHow to recover that Old BackUp.\n\nA: iTunes usually just updates the previous backup as part of its incremental backup process. But you can look in the iTunes Preferences ->  Devices tab to see all of the backups iTunes sees to make sure:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215\nTo make extra sure that there's not a partial or broken backup that iTunes isn't seeing, you can also go look in the folder for the backups. Here's an article I wrote with instructions for getting to the iTunes backups folder on different OSes:\nhttps://deciphertools.com/blog/where-are-iphone-backups/\n", "Q: Freeing up iPhone storage I'm trying to figure out how to free up phone storage space without losing all my pics. I have some loaded onto my laptop (Windows); don't know why they aren't all loading. I want to free up phone pic space but not lose all the pics.

But when I turn it to off position I get the prompt \"turning off photo stream will delete all photo stream photos from your iPhone\".  Will they be saved to the cloud or not?  Pretty confusing.\n\nA: In iOS, they recently introduced an option to have all your photos saved to the cloud, and have low-quality photos remaining on your phone. If you go into Settings > Photos and select Optimize iPhone Storage, this will happen and a considerable amount of space will be freed.\n\nAnother alternative is by an app that you can download.

Running iOS 10.2\nI added the root certificates of CAcert to my iPhone profile using various ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*directly from their website in mobile Safari\n\n*sent by email to mail app\n\n*by adding a profile with the Apple Configurator 2 software\n\n\neach time the certs show in the profile, but they are marked as \"not checked / validated\" in red.\nEverytime mail app tries to connect to the mail server a warning dialog pops up that it cannot validate the mail server. Consequently it does not connect. Plus the popups are very annoying.\nOn MacOS the CAcert certificates are added to the Keychain and MacOS Mail works just fine. Same with all browsers and Apache running on the same box. It's a wildcard certificate (*.example.com) that I se for all services. All fine except mail.app on iOS - this also used to work fine with mail app in the past as well, by the way (older version of iOS).\nAn ideas?\n\nA: In addition to the root certificate you will in some instances also need to add the intermediate certificate in case the mail server you're connecting to does not present the full certificate chain.\nYou can download the intermediate certificate here:\nhttp://www.cacert.org/?id=3\n\nA: I've had the same problem I install the CaCert root and intermediate via iPhone Configurator 2 mobile profile.   This then works on iOS9 and MacOS devices perfectly.   However with iOS10 it appears that the CACert isn't not trusted.\nNor does it even listed in the 'override'config page.  \nI can only conclude that with iOS10 the certificate validation criteria has been tightened and that CACert contains something that Apple deems as untrustworthy.\nCan't find anyone in Apple support to say why it doesn't work :-(\n", "Q: How to get iPhone ECID from MacOS terminal I currently have libmobiledevice installed on my Mac and would like to use it (or another tool) to retrieve the ECID from my iPhone which would be connected via USB.\nTo install ibmobiledevice on my Mac, I enterned the bash command `` in terminal which has given me access to the following commands.\nidevice_id                idevicecrashreport        idevicedebugserverproxy\nideviceimagemounter       idevicename               ideviceprovision\nidevicebackup             idevicedate               idevicediagnostics\nideviceinfo               idevicenotificationproxy  idevicescreenshot\nidevicebackup2            idevicedebug              ideviceenterrecovery\nideviceinstaller          idevicepair               idevicesyslog\n\nI have tried ideviceinfo, however, I cannot seem to the ECID infomation. \n\nA: You simply run this command:\nideviceinfo | grep UniqueChipID\nThe \"unique chip ID\" is what you know as the ECID.\nNote: iTunes shows the ECID as a hexadecimal value, while ideviceinfo shows it as a decimal value.\n", "Q: Redownloading iWork for iPad apps without paying for them I bought an iPad Air 2 fourteen months ago.

What is it called when an app crashes and it ends up logging you out, without restarting your computer?  The computer never fully turns off because the /tmp fold doesn't get reset.\n\nA: This is most often caused by the WindowServer process crashing. However, there's not really a name for this specific type of crash.\nOn iOS it corresponds to the Springboard crashing, which is then named \"springboarding\".\nHowever, no such name exists in common use for macOS.\n\nA: The german word would be \"neustartunmöglichweilnekernerweiterunghängt\" ;)\nI english I'd call it time for\n(sudo kextunload *; sudo shutdown -h now)\n\n", "Q: Quarantined root directory on primary drive?

Trying to find old files via Time Machine I recently bought the new iPhone 7 and backed it up via iCloud however, apparently all of the notes I had on my old phone were not saved to the cloud. (I already erased my phone so there's no going back that way). Is there a location on my MacBook (via Time Machine) where my Notes files were saved that I can locate via TimeMachine? I already checked the Notes app and it just has the 3 notes that were saved on the cloud. I'm running 10.10.5 Yosemite.\n\nA: As you would know, Time Machine backs up what's on your Mac. Because of this, it's not possible for your Time Machine backups to have copies of your iPhone notes unless you:\n\n\n*\n\n*also backed up your old iPhone via iTunes on your MacBook, and/or\n\n*did have all your iPhone notes backed up to iCloud at some point in time\n\n\nScenario 1\nThis is a more difficult scenario to work with since all you want to recover is your Notes data.  It's not impossible, but to make it practical you would still need access to your old iPhone or use specialised data recovery software. If Scenario 2 applies, try that first. Otherwise, if you do still have access to your old iPhone then you could restore your old iPhone from an older iTunes Backup (located within your TM backups) and then access your old notes that way to either resync back to iCloud or to just copy from and paste into another app (e.g. Pages, Word, Evernote, etc) and then copy from their into new notes in iCloud or your iPhone 7.\nScenario 2\nYour Notes data is stored in a Core Data database located in your user Library.  More specifically, it is located in the following path:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes\nTherefore, within your Time Machine backups you would be looking for the above location to recover your notes from.\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The ~ indicates your User directory, not the root level of your drive.\n\n*Depending on your situation you may not see this directory by browsing your TM backups. If you don't know how to make this visible there are questions here on Stack Exchange that deal with this.\n\n*Within the Notes folder there will be files named as follows:  NotesVx.storedata-yyy where the x could be a 1 or 2 or 3 etc (depending on your version of Notes) and yyy denotes additional file name characters (e.g. shm, etc).\n\n\nIMPORTANT - This is a database so you can't restore a single note - it's all or nothing! You could restore the whole database, but if you're syncing with iCloud, there is the chance that even if you restore it, that it will sync and then get deleted again.\nAnother option\nYou could also just copy the NotesVx.storedata file and edit the file extension by changing it to .html and then open that in Safari. By doing this you should be able to see all your old notes (assuming they were there to begin with). Then it's just a process of copying and pasting into new notes.\n", "Q: Can you use a single partition for two different time machine backups? I have a hard drive which has one HFS partition of 1TB that is being used as a MacBook backup.\nCan I backup another MacBook to the same partition without overwriting or convoluting data?\n\nA: Yes, the Time Machine system handles this automatically.\nThere's one major drawback in that you cannot decide on a storage quota for each backup. This means that if you have 1 TB of backup storage, you cannot decide that 500 GB is reserved for computer A and 500 GB for computer B.\nSo if the backup of one computer is too large, that could make it impossible to take a full backup of the other computer.\nYou can limit the size of a Time Machine backup though by executing on each Mac:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize -integer size\n\nwith size in MB. Example:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize -integer 500000\n\n\nA: I would highly recommend creating a separate partition for each computer that is being backed up via Time Machine, and if required (optionally) create another separate partition for general storage.\nAs an example... for a 4TB drive:\nPartition 1 - Time Machine Backups (Computer 1) - 500GB\nPartition 2 - Time Machine Backups (Computer 2) - 500GB\nPartition 3 - General Storage - 2TB (optional)\nThe potential issue I see with jksoegaard's recommendation is that if you ever perform a major MacOS version update, or system restore, on either or both computers - and then forget to immediately reapply the sudo command to set the MaxSize - the MacOS update may inadvertently set MaxSize back to using the full disk space (system default) and will stop applying the storage quotas... before you have a chance to realise.\nUsing partitions, however, you can more effectively apply a storage quota for each computer backup irrespective of MacOS updates in the future.\nI found this link very helpful:\nhttp://www.baligu.com/pondini/TM/4.html\n", "Q: How to get macOS Wi-Fi device name programmatically in Bash script? bash% networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder\nAn asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled.\n(1) SAMSUNG Modem\n(Hardware Port: Modem (SAMSUNG_MDM), Device: SAMSUNG_MDM)\n\n(2) Ethernet\n(Hardware Port: Ethernet, Device: en0)\n\n(3) FireWire\n(Hardware Port: FireWire, Device: fw0)\n\n(4) Wi-Fi\n(Hardware Port: Wi-Fi, Device: en1)\n\n(5) Bluetooth PAN\n(Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN, Device: en2)\n\nThis is good for reading but how do I get 'en1' programmatically in a Bash script so I can use the device name in a cron job?\n\nA: In your question I know you used networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder however I'd use networksetup -listallhardwareports instead as it's easier to parse the output using awk, by itself, with a minimum of coding so as to avoid multiple pipes using several other commands as offered in the other answer and should be robust enough to produce consistent output until Apple changes the output format of networksetup -listallhardwareports, if they ever do.\nAs an example on my system, networksetup -listallhardwareports shows the following:\n$ networksetup -listallhardwareports\n\nHardware Port: Bluetooth DUN\nDevice: Bluetooth-Modem\nEthernet Address: N/A\n\nHardware Port: Display Ethernet\nDevice: en3\nEthernet Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nHardware Port: Display FireWire\nDevice: fw0\nEthernet Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nHardware Port: Wi-Fi\nDevice: en0\nEthernet Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nHardware Port: Bluetooth PAN\nDevice: en2\nEthernet Address: N/A\n\nVLAN Configurations\n===================\n$ \n\nLooking at the relevant lines of output:\nHardware Port: Wi-Fi\nDevice: en0\n\nThe easiest way to get en0, in this example is:\nnetworksetup -listallhardwareports | awk '/Wi-Fi/{getline; print $2}'\n\nIt can be assigned to a variable:\nwifiDevice=\"$(networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk '/Wi-Fi/{getline; print $2}')\"\n\nYou can then use $wifiDevice later in the script to represent en0, in this example.\nObviously on your system, based on the output in your question, $wifiDevice would be: en1\n\nIf you want to use networksetup -listnetworkserviceorderthen you can use awk, by itself, in this manner:\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder | awk '{gsub(/\\)/, \"\")}/Wi-Fi, Device/{print $5}'\n\nHowever, I'd use my first example over this.\n\nI'd also stay away from using system_profiler in this case, as it takes considerably longer for the output to be generated then when using networksetup.\n\nA: You can pipe the output  grep awk and cut as an option:\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder | grep -i \"Wi-Fi, Device\" | awk '{ print $5 }' | cut -c 1-3\n\nYou can also use system_profiler to get details about your AirPort adapter:\nsystem_profiler SPAirPortDataType\nThen, you can again, pipe that output through grep to get your adapter:\nsystem_profiler SPAirPortDataType | grep Interfaces -A1\n", "Q: Bootcamp Refuses to create boot drive because iso is too large? all.  I am a longtime bootcamp user and have dealt with a fair amount of its crazy errors, but this new one really has me stumped.  So I recently deleted my windows 7 partition because it refused to update, and decided to simply reinstall windows 7 from scratch from an iso that had the most recent updates installed, which would unironically take less time than trying to figure out how to make win update work.\nHalfway through the normal process of creating a boot drive, bootcamp keeps giving me this error:\n\nThe usb I am using is an 8Gb Kingston that I have been using for bootcamp installations for a few years, but other usb's also exhibit this error, and other iso's I managed to find that also contain an updated win7 also don't work.  The only thing I can imagine causing this is the fact that the iso is bigger than normal, and the biggest file in it is 4.1 Gb.  \nIs there a way to make bootcamp maybe use exFat formatting or somehow else accept this iso?  I refuse to get win10, and a regular installation simply does not install security updates.  \nAny help at all would be informative and extremely appreciated by me. Thank you all sincerely in advance.\nEDIT:  It seems that the larger file size is indeed what prevented the recovery drive from being made - I wish Apple had created a more specific error message in that case.  Formatting it to exFat does not work as bootcamp does not recognize it, sadly.  Thanks for the help anyway.\n\nA: In the past, an 8 GB USB would suffice to create a Bootcamp boot drive for Windows 10 (talking from experience), but now you need \"a blank 16 GB or larger USB 2 flash drive,\" as Apple states on their Boot Camp support website. I too found out the hard way, as the process of creating a boot drive on my old 8 GB USB failed.\nIt's possible that the latest versions of Windows 10 (Anniversary Edition onwards) simply require more than 8 GB for their installers.\n", "Q: Apple's servers (i.e. all apple.com servers incl. iTunes and App Store) not loading every couple of days Okay, this is a strange one.\nEver since 2017 rolled around I have had this weird situation where I cannot load any pages from an Apple server on one of my iMacs.

Nor did clearing caches, switching off extensions, switching to another user account. I also checked Google Chrome's settings (looking for some sort of DNS caching/prefetching option) to see if I could identify why it works, thinking that would help me troubleshoot the issue - but I didn't see anything obvious.\nHowever, one solution I have found that resolves this issue is:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect using a VPN that places me in another country\n\n*load apple.com in Safari\n\n*disconnect from the VPN\n\n*now all apple servers load fine in Safari and Firefox, as well as both the iTunes and App Store apps\n\n\nUnfortunately, within a day or so the problem reappears and again, the only fix I've found is the one above.

What is the proper name/number of the proper cable to get the fastest charging and data transfer for the new MacBook Pro? \nObviously it came with a wall charger and a cable but I am looking to purchase a 3rd party cable/adapter and I am finding it very confusing between all the USB-3, USB-C, USB 2.0 Type-C, Thunderbolt 3...\nWhich cable and wall charger is the right kind/type to get the fastest charging and data transfer? If you could recommend or link to some it would be appreciated. \n\nA: When it comes to USB-C cables it's fast, long, cheap, pick two.\nPassive cables are going to be the least expensive.  By being passive they avoid expensive electronics but they also put limits on length and bandwidth.  The faster the cable the shorter it must be.  Unrelated to the length of the cable is it's capability to carry current.  There are two current ratings for USB-C cables, 3 amps and 5 amps.  All USB-C compliant cables must be able to carry 3 amps safely.  Those rated for 5 amps must be \"tagged\" electronically to tell the charger and device it is capable of carrying 5 amps.  Even though they will have a electronics in them to indicate this current carrying capability they can still be considered \"passive\" because they do not have any electronics on the data carrying conductors.\nThere is no easy way to tell a 3 amp cable from a 5 amp cable.  The difference in thickness of the conductors that carry the current is quite small and so it is easily disguised by the insulating jacket which can have considerable variance in thickness depending on the composition and quality.  Simply, a 5 amp cable is not necessarily thicker than a 3 amp cable.\nWhat are commonly called \"charge only\" USB-C cables are in fact USB 2.0 cables.  These are often relatively inexpensive because they have no active circuitry except perhaps the 5 amp \"tag\".  There's three ways I am aware of for USB-PD devices to negotiate power delivery over a cable, and a USB-C charging cable will have to support all three to be considered USB-C and USB-PD compliant.  One is to negotiate power on the USB 2.0 data lines.  Another is to use the configuration channel pins to negotiate power.  The third means uses communications on the Vbus lines.  Because USB 2.0 communications is an option for USB-PD negotiation these cables can be used for connecting devices at 480 Mbps even though they are advertised as \"charge only\".  Also because they must adhere to the USB 2.0 specification for communications they cannot be longer than USB 2.0 allows.  This length limit for a passive USB 2.0 cable is 5 meters, but I have yet to actually see a passive USB-C cable that is this long, 2 or 3 meters will be far more common.  There are of course USB 2.0 cables longer than 5 meters but they do this with a data repeater in the middle, these are not passive cables and they are not cheap.\nPassive USB-C cables for 5, 10, or 20 Gbps will be limited to 1 meter or less.  As a matter of keeping these inexpensive they will often also be limited to 3 amps so as to avoid having the electronic tag and heavier power conductors.  Passive 40 Gbps Thunderbolt and USB4 cables will be noticeably less than 1 meter, they will be advertised as 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, or something in length.  Passive cables by their nature of being just a bundle of wires will work just as well (or poorly) for Thunderbolt, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, or any alternate mode as any other.\nActive cables are not limited in length like passive cables.  Because they have active electronics in them they will have some limits on the protocols they support, and they will be much more expensive than a passive cable of the same length.\nHow can anyone tell these cables apart?  One way is by the markings on the ends of the cables.  It's not illegal to make a cable that does not comply with the USB-C spec.  It is illegal to make a non-compliant cable and put trademarked USB iconography on the cable.  The same goes for Thunderbolt.  The people behind USB and Thunderbolt will defend those symbols because their income depends on people trusting those symbols.\nTo know how much bandwidth a cable supports look for the icon.  The standard USB \"trident\" means it supports USB 2.0.  The USB trident with the stylized \"SS\" means it supports at least 5 Gbps, cables that support 10 Gbps will have a 10 next to the trident, and you can guess what it means if you see 20 or 40.  Thunderbolt cables will have the Thunderbolt icon, and those that support Thunderbolt 3 often have a little 3 next to the symbol.\nYou likely won't much care if you have an active or passive cable.  I went through that discussion so as to explain why you might see a 1 meter cable cost twice as much as a 0.8 meter cable, and a 2 meter cable only a few dollars more than a 1 meter cable.  It will also explain why one 2 meter cable will make your external drive work real fast and another will make it work real slow.\nSo far I've been able to keep my USB-C cables apart by buying only passive cables.  I know my 2 meter cables are 5 amp and 480 Mbps, and my 1 meter cables are 3 amp and 10 Gbps.  If I need an active cable in the future then I'll try to make it distinctive by getting it in a unique color or I'll have to pay closer attention to the markings on the cable ends.\n\nA: \nWhat is the proper name/number of the proper cable to get the fastest\ncharging and data transfer for the new MacBook Pro?\n\nCharging\nCharging has more to do with the adapter than it does with the cable.\nThe new MacBook Pro uses an 87W/61W (15\" and 13\" MacBook Pro respectively) power adapter.  So, if you use a 60W power adapter it will charge, but slowly regardless of the cable.  To get the maximum speed, you need a charger equal to or greater than the specified power adapter rating.\nAs of the time of this writing, there are no USB-C power adapter greater than 61W available.  Unfortunately, you have to use the Apple supplied power adapter until 3rd party adapters are released onto the market.  That said, the 87W power adapter will work just fine on the MacBook Pro 13\" (61W).\nAny USB-C cable will be able to handle up to 100W of power.  My recommendation is to get a good cable from a reputable manufacturer.  I have always had good results with Anker products\nData Transfers\nIf you have a USB-C cable (it conforms to the USB 3.1 specification) it will handle transfer speeds of 10Gbs.  Period.  If it's a USB-C cable, that's the maximum you will get.\nIf you have a Thunderbolt device (storage) then you need to get a Thunderbolt 3 cable.  Belkin makes a high quality Thunderbolt 3 cable.  The data transfer rate is 40Gbs.  While it uses a USB-C connector, and carries the USB signal, unlike a USB cable, it also carries the Thunderbolt signal thus the price difference.\nImportant:  You will not get higher data transfer rates by plugging in a USB-C type Thunderbolt cable into a USB-C device.  You will get USB-C speeds of 10Gbs\nWhat cable do you get?\nThe question is, what are you connecting?\nIf you are connecting a USB device, then get the USB cable.  If you are connecting a Thunderbolt device, then get a Thunderbolt cable.  Regardless, both cables will charge at whatever rate your power adapter can deliver and will transfer data only as fast as your device will allow.\n", "Q: Snow Leopard Server 10.6.8 under Fusion 7.1.3 on Sierra 10.12.2 I have seen posts like Snow Leopard Server in Fusion VM: installation keeps failing on how to install Snow Leopard Server 10.6.8 on a VMware VM, but as best I can tell, the recommended solution is to create a .dmg file from the disk, and then do one of several things, including install Snow Leopard 10.6.4 or more recent.

A deep scan of the example disk1 (8 TB/USB 3) would take at least 40 hours.\n\nIf you choose to refrain from a data recovery and start the Time Machine backup from scratch, simply open Disk Utility, erase the whole disk and partition it to one disk with a GUID Partition Map and OS X Extended (Journaled) format. Then choose the new empty volume in the Time Machine preferences pane and configure a new TM task.\n\nA: Testdisk deep scan will be the first thing I'll try, like the others pointed out this is unfortunate since you shredded the fs catalogue, partition table has a backup header but this is half the problem since it describes only the table and not what's on the volume- that's kept in nodes within the volume, partially seen when listing .dotfiles in fs root / - you can see few. \nI don't know that much about hfs+ fs but deep scanning pattern matching might be only option. Thinking about it, such fs would be very bad implementation if hfs can be crippled by wiping 1% of total volume space- so maybe it's not that bad, I doubt Apple will have seething like that as its proprietary file system but- I don't know for sure. Gotta sip through some docs. Don't do anything that might write to this disk yet and wait a bit until more people read this- and deep scanning takes a lot of time, I know that pain :/ \n", "Q: How to make external display go to sleep after xx mins?

It basically creates a filter using osacompile and osadecompile to convert between plain text source and a compiled AppleScript.\nI noticed however, that some applications referenced in the scripts are unexpectedly starting on git add and the culprit is osadecompile.\nExample:\nWhen I run osadecompile script.scpt against the following script, a Firefox starts up:\ntell application \"Firefox\"\n    open location \"https://apple.stackexchange.com\"\nend tell\n\nIt doesn't open the location specified, however the Firefox process gets started and remains running.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there anything I can do to avoid this?\n\n*What exactly is happening here? Does the script run in background (other actions  from the scripts - like say \"something\" do not seem to run)?\n\nA: I am not sure what the technical reason for this is, but accessing the AppleScript dictionary of some applications seems to require opening them. When I try opening the AppleScript dictionary of Firefox through Script Editor, Firefox will also be opened. When I try opening the dictionary of Keynote v5.3 (iWork'09 version), the app is opened, while when I try this with Keynote v7.0.5, the app is not opened. As Script Editor exhibits the same behavior, I am not sure there's any way to avoid this with osadecompile.\nI did not read the Apple Developer documentation on AppleScript in detail, but I noticed this sentence which also suggests some applications need to be opened to access their AppleScript dictionary while some don’t:\n\nAn aete is useful in 10.4 and earlier, in both Carbon and Cocoa applications, to provide a dictionary that scripting languages can use without launching the application.\n\n\nA: Here is an AppleScript solution that will let you compile or decompile the code in either Terminal or Script Editor without Firefox actually launching. In fact, this  same concept worked for every application I tried.\nThis works for me on macOS Big Sur.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set |Firefox| to name of (application file id \"org.mozilla.firefox\" as alias)\nend tell\n\ntell application |Firefox|\n    open location \"https://apple.stackexchange.com\"\nend tell\n\n", "Q: DiskUtility throwing \"com.apple.disutility error 3\" on \"Operation failed with status 5\" on Sierra while making image backup of main SSD On a MacBook Air running Sierra, I'm trying to create an image backup from my main SSD to an external USB disk using a clean shutdown, then during start: Command-R -> Disk Utility.\nBoth the main SSD and USB HDD get through \"first aid\" fine.\nI'm not using file vault.\nIt fails right at the end (after the progress bar has been fully blue).\nMy Google tries all fail to return meaningful results:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.google.com/search?q=\"disk+utility\"+\"error+3\"+\"status+5\"\n\n*https://www.google.com/search?q=\"disk+utility\"+\"error+3\"\n\n*https://www.google.com/search?q=\"disk+utility\"+\"status+5\"\n\n\nThe only result is from someone trying to create an ISO image from an optical disk: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7663155?start=0&tstart=0\nThis is the screen during backup (sorry for a non-PNG one: when in Command-R mode, I could not find a way to make a proper screenshot).\nOn a Retina MacBook Pro with Yosemite this works perfectly fine.\n\n\nA: I just experienced the same problem while trying to clean install Sierra. I had the same error until I asked Disk Utility to mount the internal SSD. When I did so, it asked for the password to unlock the drive. After unlocking the drive, I was able to create the disk image.\n\nA: After doing this in recovery mode then - without rebooting - open Terminal.app and check the logs to see if anything is written there to indicate the cause of the error.\nIn the Terminal run the command dmesg to see kernel messages. If you have disk I/O errors this is probably the cause of the problem.\nIf not you can try to do the image copy from the Terminal as this probably will give you better error messages when the error occurs. You can do the copy like this:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk1 of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m\nNOTE: It is very important to replace \"rdisk1\" and \"rdisk2\" with the correct disk numbers for your SSD and USB HDD. Replace 1 with the number of the source disk (SSD) and 2 with the number of the destination disk (USB HDD)\nWARNING: Everything on the USB HDD will be deleted (including the partition table). The USB HDD will contain a bit-for-bit copy of the SSD. If you want to copy to an image file instead of a copying the image directly to disk, replace \"of=/dev/rdisk2\" with \"of=/Volumes/USBHDD/myimage.img\".\nYou can find the disk numbers in Disk Utility by opening the Info (Cmd-i).\nThe command will run without giving any progress information during the copy except for any errors it might encounter.\n\nA: Was having the same issue until I figured out that you have to unmount the \"Macintosh HD\" partition before creating the image. This creates an image which includes the Recovery HD partition.\n\n\n", "Q: iMac as external display for new MacBook Pro? I've got an iMac from 2011. Will I be able to use this as an external display for the new MacBook Pro? If yes, which adapters will I need? I'm not sure what to make of this info from apples site about the MacBook ports:\n\nThe USB-C port on your Mac notebook supports charging, data transfer, and other modes such as DisplayPort video. You can use a USB-C adapter to connect to HDMI and VGA displays or connect other standard USB devices. This includes devices like iPhones, iPads, and iPods for charging and syncing, and cameras, hard drives, and thumb drives for transferring data.\n  The USB-C port on your Mac notebook doesn't support Thunderbolt devices or displays. \n\n\nA: Target display mode is supported on your iMac and how to use it is described in this support document on the Apple site.\nIt states that for the Mid 2011 iMac, which you linked to, a Thunderbolt cable will work (Thunderbolt wraps the DisplayPort data stream)\n\niMacs you can use | Cable       | Port you need\nas a display      | you need    | on your other Mac\n----------------------------------------------------\niMac (Mid 2011)   | Thunderbolt | Thunderbolt\nUse Target Display Mode\nFollow these steps to start using your iMac as a display:\n   1. Make sure both computers are turned on.\n   2. Connect the Mini DisplayPort or\n  Thunderbolt cable between the two computers.\n   3. Press Command-F2 on the keyboard of the iMac that you want to use as a display.  \nAfter you press Command-F2, your iMac displays the desktop from\n  the connected Mac.\n\nSo, you should be able to connect a new MacBook Pro via a Thunderbolt 3 -> Thunderbolt 2 adapter and a standard Thunderbolt 2 cable.\n", "Q: Cannot remove startup items I cannot remove the WD items from the startup list.

Any ideas where I have to look?\n\nA: (All Users)-login items are stored in the file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist. Normal user login items are saved to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist. \nSome WD apps add login or startup items to /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist and /Library/Preferences/loginwindow.plist.\nThe WD installer apps (e.g. WD Access for Mac) usually provide an uninstall feature which removes the respective app as well as login items or other installed files. The plist files itself won't get deleted though even if it was created by the WD installer.\nIf the uninstaller doesn't remove unwanted items you can do it yourself by either editing the global plist file or removing the complete plist. \nA default file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist or ../loginwindow.plist doesn't exist (in Sierra) but may have been created and modified by other installers. You can get the content by executing sudo defaults read /path/to/plist in the Terminal.app window.\n", "Q: \"err_certificate_invalid\" for only one host, on only one device, but in all browsers Currently, when I try to access www.comic-rocket.com on my iPad (iOS 10.2), the site will not load. \n\n\n*\n\n*Safari simply won't load the page, as if I hadn't even tried to do so.\n\n*Chrome and Dolphin will show a \"ERR_CERTIFICATE_INVALID\" error message.

Update: On a colleagues iPad Pro I can finally reproduce the issue. Probably my friends don't have the latest iOS installed, where StartCom should be removed as valid certificate authority, see jksoegaard's answer.\nIs there some way I may solve this, short of fully resetting the device?\nI already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard-Reset of the device (holding power- and home-button until the device restarts). \n\n*Resetting network settings\n\n*Resetting \"All Settings\"\n\n*Downloading the certificate on Windows, mailing it myself and installing it from the \"Mail\" app (doesn't work from Gmail).1\n\n*In a related thread2, deleting everything under \"Settings > General > Profiles\" (may be called \"Device management\" instead of \"Profiles\") was suggested. This entry however didn't even exist until I installed the certificate manually (i.e. there was nothing do delete). \n\n\nFootnotes\n1 In order to download the correct certificate, I had to disable my Antivirus temporarily, since it injects its own root certificate. Using \"SSL Detective\" on iOS, I checked that the certificates received by the iPad and by Chrome on Windows match.\n2 Certificate error when using Chrome for iOS with company CA\n\nA: Your certificate is issued by StartCom. The company has recently endured a number of scandals where they broke the rules governing certificates.\nThis means that for example new versions of Firefox does not trust StartCom certificates issued after the 21st of October 2016. Your certificate is from 2017.\nYour problems are probably caused by this. The iPad likely has newer software/certificate updates than your Windows or Android device.\nIn time expect that no one will accept your StartCom certificate.\nI suggest replacing the certificate with a new certificate!\n", "Q: How to stop the launch agent from repeatedly launching a given AppleScript I'm trying to create a launch agent, which launches an AppleScript whenever a mouse is connected.

Any solution how to resize it to its previous capacity?\n\n\n\nA: In my opinion you didn't buy a 1 TB SSD but a 1 TB + 24 GB SSHD (a hybrid drive similar to Apple's Fusion Drives). At least 46949230 blocks à 512 Bytes amount to ~24 GB.\nI haven't been able to find a model though (except for an SSHD option with the same sizes in some Dell laptops).\nIf the HDD part isn't visible at all, it's probably incompatible with macOS' disk framework.\n", "Q: Samsung UE590D external monitor settings I can't get quite the right colors on my external UE590D 4k.

I don't have any cleaning product right now at home, and the only alcohol I have is vodka.\nCan it be used to clean my keyboard and trackpad, or will it damage my laptop? (I think that alcohol is often used to clean computers, but I'm not sure that it's the same kind of alcohol)\n\nA: The type of alcohol is less important than what other contaminants are in it.\nEven strong vodka is 50% water and unknown contaminants.\nAfter many comments & other answers on what may or may not be in vodka -\nFrom The Chemistry of Vodka – Structure, Additives, and Impurities\n\nThe final factor is additives. Though we think of vodka as just\n  ethanol and water, it’s actually permitted in a number countries to\n  add small amounts of other additives. Mostly, these are to improve the\n  smoothness of the vodka, so they’re likely to be found in higher\n  amounts in cheaper vodkas containing more impurities. Compounds used\n  for this purpose include citric acid, glycerol, and sugar.\n\nI'd wait until you have something better to clean it with, like perhaps a micro-fibre cloth [3 for a pound/buck/shekel in any supermarket] Get the general purpose fluffy ones with little loops of fibre rather than the smooth ones specifically for glass, as they're a bit hard for plastic.\nWet under the cold tap, then wring out as dry as you can possibly get it. It should be dry enough that you can barely tell it wets the surface... no dribbles.\nWipe gently, repetition is better than force.  \nCheaper than vodka too... & you're even less likely to want to suck the cloth afterwards ;-)\nSee also Will alcohol or soap damage plastic or rubber? from Chemistry Stack Exchange for another good reason I recommend nothing more than water & a micro-fibre cloth.\n\nA: OF COURSE you can clean your keyboard with vodka. However, the keyboard may show ill effects after the treatment just like anyone having vodka, and - if excessive amount is applied, the keyboard (and notebook) will die.\nIn contrast with humans, the keyboard won't suffer so much from the alcohol within the vodka. It is the water, sugars and other constituents of vodka, that have ill effects on keyboards. \nFor cleaning keyboards, the best is to use a paper towel or cloth, damp (never wet or dripping!) with very mild detergent, and light cleaning movements. If you have patience, then after 3-5 minutes of such cleaning, you'll have a shiny keyboard.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: Vodka still contains a significant amount of water - and while water is good for you and alcohol not so much, the reverse is true in case anything gets into the computer.\nBe aware that some apple products contain water damage detectors that could be used against you in a warranty case even if you didn't cause the actual problem with your cleaning.\n\nA: I once tried cleaning a keyboard from a white MacBook, circa 2008 vintage, with alcohol (not sure if ethanol or isopropyl). This irreversibly damaged the key contacts and half the keyboard stopped working, which was only fixable through replacing the keyboard.\nA lightly water-damped cloth is a safer bet.\n\nA: 50% isopropyl alcohol works great, but it does have high water content so try not to let too much run down the keys into the keyboard.  You can try 90% isopropyl to reduce the amount of water for the aluminum base and/or stubborn stains on the keys.\n\nA: In general, no, you should not use vodka on your lappy. You probably should even be careful using isopropyl alcohol solution on laptops, too, given that it can destroy certain rubbers and plastics.\nYou really ought to use a product designed for this purpose. I mention such a product over on Retro in an answer for cleaning edge connectors, but it is safe and suitable for any electronics with or without mechanical parts.\nThe brand name I am most familiar with is \"CRC QD Contact Cleaner\". To quote the datasheet:\n\nIdeal for telephones, PCs, relays, edge connectors, tape heads, buss\n  bars, circuits, contacts, printed circuit boards, switches and circuit\n  breakers\n\nBut I've worked at places where it was used to clean keyboards (for example, on PCs or CNC machines on a shop floor), too. You spray liberally and let the excess boil out (it has a much lower boiling point than alcohol) taking all the gunk with it.\nSimilar products are found industry wide, and your Mac was probably sprayed with, or dipped in, something like it several time during manufacturing and shipping. If you must use some sort of solvent on electronics, this is the stuff to use.\nThere is a variety that has a light lubricant used for wipers and potentiometers, which you don't want. Other than that, any of the well-know industry standard solutions, now easily fetched from online stores, will work. \n\nA: Vodka is distilled, the fermented sugars are left behind from distilling. There are zero sugars in vodka. I don't know where \"Tetsujin\" got his statistic that it's 50% unknown contaminants. Vodka is mostly ethanol alcohol plus water and a bit of glycerol.\nThere are different kinds of alcohol produced from fermenting. Ethanol alcohol is the most drinkable kind. There's other alcohols that can be poisonous or give a rough taste, but the amount is very small. The better vodkas have been filtered to remove these, so they taste smoother. However for your purposes, this doesn't matter.\nIt's probably better than water for cleaning. Find out for sure by spraying/wiping some on glass, and see if there's a residue. The alcohol is a bit more of a solvent, and will evaporate faster than plain water.\n\nA: I don't know is it possible to clean or not, but with VODKA answer for sure is NO. It's not worth it ;)\n", "Q: Open CSV File with Different Delimiter I'm currently using the default Numbers application to open my CSVs. My current use case involves a file that I had to use a different type of separator (|). Is there any way to change the separator? Right now when I open the file it just puts the entire row in one column.\n\nA: Use sed;  the Stream EDitor from Terminal.  \nsed -i -e 's/\"|\"/|,\"/g' filename\ns is used to replace the found expression \"|\" with \",\"\ng is for \"global\", meaning  do this to the whole line. If you omit the g option it will only replace the first instance, ignoring the rest\n-i option is to \"edit in place\" meaning it changes the file itself.\n-e option indicates the expression/command to run.\n\nA: *\n\n*open your csv file in Numbers\n\n\n*You should see a Adjust Settings thing pop up, click it\n\n\n*You'll see an Import Settings dialog make sure you click on Delimited\n\n\n*in the Custom Delimiter field add |\n\n\n*Click Update Table\n\n\n*\n\n\nA: In Numbers you can use any separator when importing csv tables.\nOn the format sidebar, in the table tab, look for adjust Import settings. Inside it you have delimited options where you can even use custom delimiters\n\nA: Another option, you can open it in OpenOffice/LibreOffice. It lets you pick exactly what the delimiters are. Then once it opens, save a copy in some other format, then you can open it in Pages.\n\nA: Using the -i option for sed is courageous, but also dangerous. I would recommend the following:\nsed -e 's/\"|\"/|,\"/g' filename > tmp\n\nThen, check that the file tmp is formatted as you wanted it to be. If it is ok, then you can replace the original file with tmp:\nmv tmp filename\n\n\nA: Numbers >=5.0 after opening a csv-File you get a floating dialog \"Table data was imported. Adjust Settings\". When hitting \"Adjust settings\" you can control the delimiters. Found this solution in this tutorial\n", "Q: How do I get rid of \"access privileges\" popup message?

Easiest approach would to to restore the /usr/local hierarchy from your most recent backup (and manually reapply all changes/installs made later).\n\nA: By default /usr/local is owned by root and the directories under that don't exist so there could be odd users under that, if so the restore as per patrix's answer otherwise\nThe most usual setup in Unix/Linux is to have them all owned by root.

Is there any easy way how to achieve this? Preferred free solution if possible.\nBefore you shout \"Parental Controls\" - I have tried these and it kind of worked but not always and it is prompting for application to run (which is fine but some just keeps asking over and over).\n\nA: The easiest way to get a mode on a Mac for students taking tests is to create a second user (my school has a second user called Take Test) where they only allow access to certain apps (TextEdit, Pages, and a Dropbox thing they set up) using parental controls. Then, just have students sign out of their main account and sign into that test taking user before they take a test.\nTo create that second user, go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> + and create a user. Then, for that new test-taking user, hit the Open Parental Controls in the right pane, hit Limit Applications on This Mac, and choose the applications from the list which you'd like to allow the students to use while they take a test.\n", "Q: WhatsApp web without camera Is it possible to load WhatsApp web without camera?.

Is it possible to increase the length of time that the fade in/out from/to black takes when editing a video in iMovie (added using the Settings pop-up menu in the video timeline(?) panel at the bottom of the iMovie window (apologies if I'm not using the correct terminology))? \n(I have to say that I don't find the iMovie interface particularly intuitive and that it seems to be a little fiddly to try to change effects once you have added them to a video. I tried searching, but I couldn't find anything in the Help about this.)\n\nA: No, you cannot change the fade time in Settings > Fade Out to Black.\nEven the manual Transitions > Fade to Black does not work well because it fades to black too quickly (in about 1/3 of the duration of the transition), then it's black for the remaining 2/3 of the duration.\nIf you want a linear fade to black that you can set the duration, just add a Cross Dissolve to the end of the timeline and set the Duration of transition.\n\nA: Edit: Later, I found a much easier solution using Cross Dissolve (see\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/268993/50985 ). So I don't recommend these steps anymore, but I'm leaving it here for educational purposes.\nNo, you cannot change the fade time in Settings > Fade Out to Black.\nEven the manual Transitions > Fade to Black does not work well, it still fades too quickly. It already reaches black merely 33% into the duration of the transition. I spent hours and figured out a workaround (messy but achieves the desired result).\nLet's say you want a fade to black in the last 5 seconds of your video. To achieve that, you will need to set the Transitions > Fade to Black to 15 seconds so that it will fade to black in 5 seconds. Then we will throw away the extra 10 seconds (not trivial).\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your clip to the timeline.\n\n*Modify > Detach Audio. (This is necessary because the audio fades slower than the video. The video is black around 33% into the duration, whereas the audio can still be heard about 90% into the duration).\n\n*Go to the end of the audio clip and drag the audio handle to the left to create a 5s audio fade out.\n\n*Modify > Add Freeze Frame. Then click on the freeze frame and change the Duration to 10s in the preview panel. (This adds the extra 10 second pad at the end).\n\n*Drag the Transitions > Fade to Black effect to the end of the timeline. Double click on it to change the Duration to 15s. (The timeline will look messed up, but it's okay).\n\n*Play your video and make sure the fade to black is satisfactory (video and audio). There should be an extra 10s of black silence at the end.\n\n*File > Share > File to export an mp4 video.\n\n*Open the mp4 video with QuickTime.\n\n*Edit > Trim. Drag the right handle left by 10s and click Trim.\n\n*File > Save to save the trimmed mp4 file. (I'm pretty sure this is a lossless trim because it saved a 100MB video instantly).\n\n*Now view the final mp4 video to make sure everything is right.\n\n\nSee how easy and intuitive Mac software is? (I did the same thing in Windows Movie Maker in one step).\n\nA: Instead of using Fade out to black in project settings, I ended up adding Cross Dissolve transition to the end, selecting it, and adjusting its duration in Precision Editor, which could be opened by right-click > Show Precision Editor or Window (in the menu) > Show Precision Editor. \n\nA: Try Adding a black background / image that last .07 second and then adding cross Dissolve transition - a good work-around for a fade in or out from black.\n", "Q: Can't shut down MacBook When selecting the Apple on the top bar and then 'Shut Down' or 'Restart', Finder won't show the alert that asks you to confirm that you want to restart or shut down the computer (the one with the timer).

Can I plug the thunderbolt out from my display into my thunderbolt to USB-C adapter somehow to charge my laptop? The connections I set up now don't seem to be doing anything.\nPlease hurry ;^) 19% and dropping....  18%...!\n\nA: Thunderbolt 1 and 2 do not support power delivery.  You won't be able to charge your device from the Thunderbolt cable on your display or drives.\nThunderbolt 3 implemented the USB-C power delivery specification.\n\nBy virtue of being an Alternate Mode of USB Type-C, Thunderbolt 3\n  ports implement USB Power Delivery, allowing the ports to source or\n  sink up to 100 watts of power...\n\n\nA: I know this is an old question but I found a solution that might help for those with a similar dilemma.  MacBooks with USB-C can take in power from most any USB charger of 12 watts or more.  This means a USB charger that comes with most new iPads, iPhones, or most any personal computing devices lately will provide power to a MacBook.  Just be aware that 12 watts is the maximum USB-A can provide.  In my experience most USB-A chargers are limited to 5 watts so read the specs carefully if you want power.  It won't hurt the charger if try though, if it's a 5 watt USB charger the MacBook will simply refuse to draw power... and your battery will continue to drain.\nA 12 watt power supply isn't likely to keep your MacBook running indefinitely, but it will slow down the rate at which the battery drains.  If the MacBook is shutdown or put to sleep then 12 watts can possibly get a dead MacBook back to full charge overnight.\nWith a light work load a 27 watt USB-C charger could keep a MacBook running indefinitely.  27 watt USB-C chargers are commonly included with tablet computers and the like (at least in my experience), and seen as a common rated output for 12 volt automotive USB-C chargers.  This 27 watts is from 9 volts at 3 amps.  9 volts is simple to regulate down from a 12 volt automotive accessory outlet, and 9 volts is a standard voltage output under the USB-C specification.  3 amps is the maximum current most USB-C cables can handle.  This makes 27 watt USB-C chargers relatively cheap, and therefore relatively popular.\nOh, and ThunderBolt 1 and 2, like mini-DisplayPort which it shares a connector, does provide power from the port.  The power is not much, less than 10 watts, and not enough to do much more than provide power needed for active cables and adapters.  In fact some active adapters require more power than Thunderbolt can provide.  If you have a computer with Thunderbolt 2 port then plug your MacBook into a free USB-A port on the computer to charge your MacBook.  If it's new enough to have ThunderBolt 2 then it's new enough to provide 12 watts from a USB-A port.\nThis is assuming you have the right cable to plug your MacBook into whatever USB port you found to provide power, so even if you find a charger you might also need to find a cable.\n", "Q: Create a new document type? I have some PDF files that I want to open in preview, and others that I want to open in Acrobat. It would be nice if I could just set up that acrobat files with a different extention, say \".apdf\" and have the mac automatically open anything with .apdf with acrobat, and anything with .pdf with preview. \nBut that doesn't seem to work, because I think that the filetype is actually part of the file, not just the filename...\nany ideas?\n\nA: Select the file in Finder, then get info (cmd-i), and change the file extension (under name and extension) to something that is not used by other files.  \nThen, near the bottom of the get info window click \"Open With\" and select the app you need, i.e. Adobe Acrobat, by browsing through your application list.  Then, at the bottom of that sub-pane click the 'change all' button.  This will direct Acrobat to open all files with the extension you chose. \n\nA: While renaming a file on the desktop usually doesn't change its extension (filetype) even if you try to, you can change the name and extension in the Get Info screen. Just two-finger click (or right-click) on any file, hit Get Info, and type in any name and extension you want in the Name and Extension field of the window that appears.\nProblem solved.\ntl;dr: Get Info the file and change its filetype there.\n", "Q: How does Time Machine treat changes to the Photos Library? I've searched all over and can't find a sure answer to this question. If a new photo is added to my iCloud Photo Library, resulting in a change to the \"Photos Library\" package on my Mac found in ~/Pictures, does Time Machine simply back up the delta within the package or will it store another copy of the entire library?\n\nA: SHORT ANSWER\nTime Machine only backs up new or modified data, and keeps a record of any deleted data. This includes what's in your Photos Library. It does not do a fresh backup of the entire Photos Library each time you make changes to it.\nLONG ANSWER\nThe way Time Machine works is that it backs up anything that has changed since the last backup. For example, a file that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edited since the last backup is backed up again in the next backup\n\n*Created since the last backup is backed up in the next backup\n\n*Deleted since the last backup is not included in the next backup (i.e. there is no record of it in that backup, but the file itself is still stored for any older backups it was a part of)\n\n\nNow, the confusion usually comes from the way Time Machine actually does a backup. I'll try and explain this below.\n\n\n*\n\n*The initial backup TM does on a new backup drive is a full backup of\nyour Mac. So, if your Mac has used 80GB of a 1TB drive, then the \nfirst backup will take up 80GB of space on the new backup drive.\n\n*All remaining incremental backups do not do a full backup. Instead TM backs up any new data (i.e. newly added data and any edited data) and keeps a record of any deleted data.\n\n*In the case of files such as Packages (including the Photos Library package), TM will identify any:\n\n\n*\n\n*new data (e.g. new photos in the Masters folder within your Photos Library package) and back this up\n\n*modified data within your Photos Library package (e.g. edited photos) and back this up\n\n*deleted data within your Photos Library package (e.g. photos you've deleted) and keep a record of the change\n\n\n*When the backup drive runs out of space, TM will delete as many of the oldest backups it needs to in order to be able to do the next backup (and this is where users can lose data that was not part of more recent backups)\n\n*Regardless of whether it is the initial full backup or an incremental backup, TM will display this to the user as if they're all separate full backups. This is designed on the basis of User Experience (UX) design so that it's easier for users to browse and find data, and acts to reassure users that it's all there. According to Apple:\n\n\n\n...what makes Time Machine different from other backup applications is\n  that it not only keeps a spare copy of every file, it remembers how\n  your system looked on any given day—so you can revisit your Mac as it\n  appeared in the past.\n\nSource: Mac Basics: Time Machine (web archive of Apple knowledge base doc)\nFinally, as added reassurance that TM does not do a full backup of your Photos Library each time, I can share a personal example. My family Photos Library is 341GB in size and if this was fully backed up each time then the 2TB external drive that it's backed up to would be full after only 4 or 5 backups (allowing for other data), but that particular TM backup drive has backups going back to late 2015.\n", "Q: Why does iCloud take up 30+ gigs of storage on my Mac? For some reason iCloud is taking up over 30 gigabytes of storage on my MacBook Air. How do I get rid of this? I though the whole point of iCloud was to save space not eat it up! I'm on macOS Sierra 10.2\n\n\nA: Your iCloud Drive contents are cached. After looking over the new storage management features in Sierra, doesn't look like the \"Optimize Storage\" feature will clear that.\nIf you go to About this Mac > Storage > Manage > iCloud Drive are there options there to remove files locally? I don't use it personally so mine's empty.  :)\n\nA: You can remove iCloud storage from your Mac by going to System Preferences → iCloud, then uncheck the checkbox next to iCloud Drive.\nBeware that everything will be removed from your Mac but remain in iCloud only. This means that anything added to your Mac after this will not be stored in iCloud and you'll have to do it manually on the web.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I suppress iTunes internet connection alerts when listening with Wi-Fi disabled? I will sometimes use iTunes to listen to my laptop's music library while on an airplane or somewhere else I don't have an internet connection, and thus I turn off Wi-Fi to save battery.

If there is a pass available for you Wallet, there will be an icon on the website where you can print the pass that says Add to Apple Wallet/Passbook\nIf not, you may have to download the airline's app. Even then, there's still the chance that there won't be a mobile boarding pass.\nI know that with Southwest Airlines, you can only get a mobile boarding pass through their app, and only if it is a single ticket trip (i.e. no other people flying on the same purchase).\n\nA: If you have a .pkpass file in an app that doesn’t directly support adding the pass to Apple Wallet (e.g. attached to an email viewed in Gmail, downloaded to Files from Chrome, etc), you can send it to yourself via iMessage, as the Messages app is able to add passes to your Apple Wallet:\n\n*\n\n*Open the share sheet for the file\n\n*Select “Messages” (select the app itself, not a particular contact).

It is still turned on and I have been using the Find My iPhone app to track it - the Uber driver claims to not have it in his car, however, the location changes every few minutes and going to all bars throughout the night - therefore leading me to believe it is still in the Uber. If I play the sound through the Find My iPhone app, is there a way to tell if someone has turned off the sound once it begins playing? I know you automatically receive an email that a sound was played, but I'd like to know if you can find out if someone turned the sound off.\n\nA: The sound will play on the device regardless of the silent switch, and when the device plays a sound it reports back to iCloud and you will receive an email saying that the sound has been played. While there's no way to be sure that anybody heard it, you can safely assume that the sound was played if you get that email.\n", "Q: How to turn off your MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar via keyboard shortcut Since my new MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar I'm unable to turn off my MacBook using the keyboard CNTROPTIONCMD + Power. I saw this question about the screen lock: Simular question but there is no button in the Touch bar for turning off the Mac completely. Is there a new keyboard shortcut for this?\nThese are the only options to drag into the Touch Bar:\n\n\nA: The keyboard shortcut you refer to was actually only one of two keyboard shortcuts that worked the same way. The other one was to use ControlOptionCommand and the Eject key instead of the Power button.\nRegardless, both of these keyboard shortcut combinations will quit all apps and shut down your Mac. Of course, if you have any open documents that have not been saved you'll be asked whether you want to save them.\nSince you have a Touch Bar model, I suspect you will just need to ensure you're in the right interface to see the Eject key option.\nOtherwise, what actually happens if you still use the ControlOptionCommand and the Power combination, remembering that in your case the Touch ID doubles up as your Power button?\nIf there is no way to get that to work, you could add your own custom keyboard shortcut to achieve what you want, but that will mean changing some of the other Function Key behaviours - if this is an acceptable option and you need assistance to do this, let me know and I'll update this answer.\n[UPDATE]\nAs requested via comments, here are the steps to creating a custom keyboard shortcut using one of your Function keys to replicate the ControlOptionCommandPower button combination:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Select the Keyboard option\n\n*Ensure you are on the Keyboard tab\n\n*Make sure that the Use all F1,F2, etc. keys as standard function keys is not ticked\n\n*Now choose the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Select App Shortcuts in the lefthand column\n\n*Click \"+\" symbol at the bottom of the right pane\n\n*Leave the Application drop-down as All Applications\n\n*In the Menu Title field type this in exactly: Shut Down...\n\n*In the Keyboard shortcut field press the fn and F1 keys\n\n*Click on Add\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nNow you should be able to just press the fnF1 key combination to shutdown your MBP.\nNOTE: The reason at Step 4 I wanted you to ensure that the Use all F1,F2, etc. keys as standard function keys is not ticked was because you wanted to set the keyboard shortcut on a key that is already used for something else. However, if you do want to leave Use all F1,F2, etc. keys as standard function keys ticked, you can change the original F1 key shortcut to something else first and then set the F1 key (without the need for the fn key) as your keyboard shortcut.\nAny questions, just ask.\n\nA: Just came across the same problem: not finding the power button to force a shut down. I found the power button actually is still there and coincides with the TouchId button at the extreme right of the touch bar. No need to go through these edits of the fn keys.\n", "Q: On board / internal display works intermittently / randomly Macbook Pro Mid 2012. Original board and display. About 2 months ago, laptop screen cuts out. External display used to prove everything working normal, including passing Apple Hardware Test.

It has a 128GB M.2 SSD with 16GB of photos.  \nI'm trying to delete only the photos from my device.\nI want all the photos to stay on ICloud but be gone from my MacBook\n\nA: The only way to remove the photos from your Mac is to sign-out of iCloud.  This will keep the photos in iCloud but remove them, and all other iCloud-synced data, from the Mac.\niCloud is a syncing solution not an offline storage solution.  It's designed to give you access to your data from any device that logged-into that iCloud account.  \nFrom Apple's iCloud page:\n\niCloud connects you and your Apple devices in amazing ways. It makes sure you always have the latest versions of your important information—like documents, photos, notes, and contacts—on whatever device you’re using. It lets you easily share photos, calendars, locations, and more with friends and family. It even helps you find your device if you lose it.\n\nYou could use an external storage device to store your photos and that will free-up your Air's HDD space.\n\nA: Also if you use the Photos app, iCloud tries to do this on its own. In Photos app > Preferences > iCloud Tab > Optimise Mac Storage. \nWould that work for you?\n", "Q: Changed Apple ID email sign in, now can't sign in my daughter has an iPhone 6s, running on iOS 9.3.5, for over 6 months. She had another iPhone, 4s, that she no longer uses, and that we initially set up all her Apple info with. She hadn't setup her email on her new phone, as she didn't use the associated email address regularly anymore. (It was an old email she set up when younger that she didn't care for the name). It's with this email address her iTunes and App Store was tied to. She set up a new email a few months back, with a less cutesy name (now that she's older) and this was the one she wanted to use for her 6s. She wanted to use the original email as her secondary and switch everything to her current email address. \nShe is not on iCloud. \nI went to the apple site, and saw the options to switch your Apple ID  to a different email, and the other option after setting up that, to then switch her Apple ID login to her newer email. All went well, as we received the verified codes sent to her current email (accessed by laptop), to set this all up. It seemed all very seamless. It verified her new email address was the ID and to be used in place of the older email address.\nHowever, moments later, when going to App Store, the older email address was still there. We shut those windows, and restarted phone, but older email address remained. We signed out of the older email address, and signed in with new one. We got an error message. We then said let's see if older one worked, it does not either (of course, we knew this, we got verification it was switched to new email). \nSo now she can't set up email. And she's afraid she will lose all her games on her phone, all the progress she's made on her different apps, she's afraid she will lose her notes that were associated with the older email address, the one she wanted to switch to secondary, but still use on occasion. She is afraid all her progress with Game Centre will be lost. The games are still usable, but it asks her to sign in, and she skips that step now, because she can't sign in.\nWe followed the instructions. I keep going over what we did, and we did the correct steps. \nWhat went wrong? Will she lose all her information? Can any one shed some light on this for us?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: My suggestion is to sign out of iTunes & App Stores and try to log in using the new email.  If you go to the App Store after that and her purchases are still there then you are good to go.\nSettings > AppleId > Sign out\nIf when you attempt to login with the new email it asks you to fill out additional information then her new email is most likely a new apple id and you will not be able to use that email in the app store or iTunes and have access to what she previously purchased.\nIf it signs in and you have access to all her previous purchases then you are good to go.  If not then sign out again and log back in with the old apple id.\nKeep in mind there are many places that you will need to change you apple id if you want to completely switch.  All are accessible in settings.  Examples are:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud\n\n*iTunes & App Store\n\n*Mail\n\n\nI have been through several different hells regarding my apple id.  The unfortunate best advice is not to try to change your apple id to an icloud.com or me.com address.  I have two that I manage now.  I don't like it and apple is unable to fix it which I think is ridiculous.\nMy best advice for if she wants to change her apple id to something less cute is to start from scratch.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a non-apple related email address using your preferred service that is less cute (I used gmail)\n\n*Login to https://appleid.apple.com with the old cute email\n\n*In the Account section, there is an edit link\n\n*This will allow you to change the apple id email to the new email address\n\n*Perform the log out steps from above and sign back in to each of them with the new email address.\n\n", "Q: How do I distinguish text conversations from the same contact with different phone numbers?

However, this problem occurred before the updates too. I use Notes on both devices with my iCloud account. When I create a note on the mac, it shows up on the phone. When I edit on the mac those edits show up on the phone. However, no new notes or edits from the phone show up on the mac.\nThis leads to silly effects such as: if I create note \"aa\" on the mac, I will have \"aa\" on the mac and \"aa\" on the phone.

The speakers work as usual, but when I plug in headphones, the audio stops working. When I remove the headphones, the speakers work again as before.\nWith headphones plugged in, the only output device available is \"Digital Out - Optical digital-out port\", and when I try to change the volume there is a disabled symbol (and no volume bar is displayed).\nI have tried rebooting, using a different set of headphones, resetting the PRAM, and cleaning the port, all to no avail. I do not see a red light in the port as many other questions have mentioned.\n\nA: Do you have a pair of OEM Apple headphones (from an iPhone or so)?

Then at the bottom set audio port for \"sound output.\" \n\nA: Daan's answers above work for probably a majority of people with this problem, but if you're like me, and those fixes stop working after a while or don't work at all, it's possible to actually break the circuit that erroneously switches you to the Digital Output and prevent it from activating, leaving you with headphones and speakers and normal.\nThe solution, which originally comes from stin17 on this MacRumors thread, is intimidating but uncomplicated. We simply want to interrupt the line between the audio codec IC on the logic board and the little switch in the headphone jack by removing a component in between. This is usually a small resistor on older models, and after the Retina MBPs I believe it is an inductor.\nIf you can correctly identify your logic board model number (physically located on the logic board itself, usually a 6- or 7-digit number; for example, my 2012 MBP with a 2.3GHz i7 is a model A1286 and board number 820-3330-B) and find the boardview and schematic, you'll be able to find a resistor in line with the digital output switch, which, when removed, will prevent the audio codec IC from reading the digital switch. This permanently disables the optical digital/TOSLINK audio output, and you should not do this unless you are certain you've found the right resistor! However, if you're sure you know which components you're looking at, it takes about 10 seconds to scrape the tiny surface-mount resistor off the logic board with an x-acto knife.\nIf you have an A1286 macbook, it is likely R6805, which you can find in schematics and boardviews; this part number will certainly be different on other models. On my logic board, the circuit we want to interrupt is labeled AUD_PORTB_DET_L. Later models, after Retina I believe seem to rename this circuit to AUD_CONN_TIPDET_1 or AUD_CONN_TIPDET_2; I'd guess TIPDET_1 is headphone detection and TIPDET_2 is TOSLINK detection, but I'm not positive since I don't have one of those boards to check. Make sure you double check these on your particular model! I can't guarantee that R6805 is the one to get, but that's a good place to start.\nThe result here is that the digital switch inside the headphone jack remains physically stuck, but it no longer matters as it cannot complete its circuit to erroneously tell the audio IC that there is a TOSLINK plug in the jack. Again, optical digital audio output over TOSLINK does not work after doing this, unless you replace the resistor and go back to the current \"digital out\" problem, but it sounds like you don't need optical digital audio output. This is straightforward and familiar for some, for others it's new and terrifying! I started learning my way around schematics and boardviews because of this exact problem. If you feel up to the task and you don't need TOSLINK audio output from your headphone jack, this is the most reliable and elegant fix when the other temporary methods fail.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use Siri with my Bluetooth? I have a new Bluetooth headset and would like to use Siri with it. As far as I know, the standard way is to hold down the \"call\" button for a long press. Unfortunately, my headset treats a 3-second press as a \"turn off\" signal. Is there a workaround? Possible options I've thought of include shortening the press needed to trigger Siri, remapping the \"redial\" function (which on this headset involves double-tapping the button\", using an alternate combo to trigger Siri, or turning on \"Hey Siri\" for Bluetooth only.\n\nA: Most wireless headsets use a double tap of the main button for voice commands (like Siri)\nYou are trying to use it like wired headphones that have the controller by trying with the hold of the main button\nIf it has a second button also try double pressing or holding it\n\nA: Airpods do this quite well.

When trying to compress some stuff to a zip (via the Archive Utility) it pops up a new Finder window after each compression.\nHere are my Archive Utility settings:\n\nAs you can see \"Reveal archive in Finder\" is turned off. I've also tried turning it on and off a few times, but result was always the same.\nIt started to happen after upgrading to Sierra.\nMy current macOS version is 10.12.2.\nIs there any fix to this?\n\nA: After some experimenting, I finally found a solution of sorts.\nBefore I get to it, just a word on the Archive Utility preferences. As far as I can tell, the preferences on the lower half of the window no longer have any effect on the Finder's archive creation process. It may have in the past, but the Finder no longer uses Archive Utility for archive creation, only for expansion. For the record, Archive Utility is located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Archive Utility.app.\nThe problem arises from the Finder's desire to reveal the archive it's just created. If you are in column view and are viewing the contents of a folder, and want to compress that folder and do so like in the image below, the Finder may open a new window to reveal the archive because it doesn't want to lose your folder selection in the current window.:\n\nIf instead in column view, you select a file (it must be a file) in the same column as the folder, and then right-click on the folder you want to compress, like in the image below, the Finder won't open a new window (it will change your current file selection to the newly created file).\n\nSo far, that's the closest I've come to any kind of \"solution\".\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but I've had this annoyance for as long as I've used a Mac and compressed any files/folders.\nPiggy-backing off of @NSGod's answer, having nothing at all selected before right-clicking a folder to compress also works.\n\nMaking sure nothing is selected, I was able to compress a folder fine.\nIt seems that Archive Utility's preferences do not affect the right-click menu options at all—the above works with and without archive format set to Zip archive and Reveal archive in Finder checked or not checked.\n\n\nA: Checking and unchecking the \"Reveal archive in Finder\" option in Archive Utility -> Settings didn't work for me either, until I killed Finder. \nTo do this open the Terminal and type in: \nkillall Finder\n\nThen hit enter, which should reload the Finder windows.\n- If you are uncomfortable with the terminal, you should be able to just restart your computer.\nPre solution fiddles\nI did some tinkering with the setting before I got it working.\nOpened Archive Utility -> Settings\nThe \"Reveal archive in Finder\" option was unchecked, so I checked it and closed the Archive Utility for it to update.\nThen reopened Archive Utility, unchecked the option, closed the Archive Utility again.\nThen ran the killall Finder command in Terminal\n\nA: I'm a longtime mac user... currently use macOS 11.6.

It's a button I've never used, apart from when I first bought my MacBook sometime two years ago.\nI still need the button to be able to turn on the device, obviously.\n\nA: DanHollis solution is good, but it merely disables the button in software. I'll tell you how to completely disable the button.\nYou will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Center hole punch. 1/8\" recommended.\n\n*A hammer, preferably light-weight so you have very fine control of your swing.\n\n\nStep One\nAlign the CHP over the power button. The 'Center' in Center Hole Punch is instructive - you need to make sure you're exactly over the switch itself. Done correctly, this will remove the switch without affecting any other components in your MacBook.\nStep Two\nSwing the hammer. Sounds simple, but it's not. Make the swing fast and accurate, but don't put much force behind it. The point here is to strike quickly enough to punch out the switch itself, but not with enough force to penetrate deeper and actually damage something. Done right, the CHP will strike through and permanently disable the switch. Too fast or forceful and you'll break the computer. Too slow and you'll just turn the computer off.\nResults\nYour power button is now completely disabled. If the need arises, you can start the computer by manually shorting the contacts the switch connects to. On my desktop I can do this by arcing the pins with a knife, but the MacBook won't offer you the internal space to do that. I leave this as an exercise to the reader.\nSuggestions\nYou might want to practice your hammer swings before doing this for real. I suggest practicing on a meaty part of your leg. The objective is to swing as fast as possible without feeling pain. If you swing too hard, it'll hurt. Too soft, and you'll just be tapping your leg. However, if the hammer bounces back and it doesn't hurt, you're doing it right. Just practice until you're confident and you'll do fine.\n\nA: I currently am not in front of my mac but I found this command: \ncd /System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj\nmv PowerButton.nib PowerButton1.nib\n\nhere in which you can save it as an app and auto start it at login here\nYou can also use a program like PowerKey to remap the power button, it will still shut down if you hold it as that is handled by the motherboard, not the OS (whether you're using regular macOS or Windows through Bootcamp)\nThere is no way of disabling the press and hold force shutdown as it is handled by the hardware and cannot be affected by the software... unless possibly flash an edited BIOS that disables it\nIf I need to improve this, please tell me how\nI will be testing this for myself tomorrow\n\nA: I make the app PowerKey, which allows you to remap a tap of the power key to input Forward Delete or another command.

I haven't done any research on that so I can't provide a lot a details about that, but that is a possible solution.\nI can't find any reason to why would you want to use a proxy for Adobe or a VPN client. Adobe softwares generally don't require the internet to work, while VPN client connects you to a proxy.\nOne more thing - our school's IT manager sets up a school-wide proxy that allows us to access Google and Wikipedia (I'm in China). This is a far more efficient way than setting up on one's laptop.\n", "Q: Global convert to uppercase and lowercase in macOS?

Alternately, you can use the -plist option and parse the XML if it fits your use case better.\n\nCreating the Keychain item:\nFor Time Machine to automatically do scheduled backups to a Time Capsule, the disk image password must be stored in the system wide keychain located at /Library/Keychains/System.keychain rather than your password protected user login keychain.\nTo non-interactively create an entry in the System keychain, you can do:\n$ security add-generic-password -D \"disk image password\" \\\n-T /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework/Versions/A/Resources/diskimages-helper \\\n-a `hdiutil isencrypted /path/to/your/TimeMachine.sparsebundle 2>&1 | grep uuid | cut -f2 -d\" \"` \\\n-s \"TimeMachine.sparsebundle\" \\\n-w $YOUR_PASSPHRASE \\\n/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n\nwe invoke the uuid command from the previous step in a subshell here to use as the account name.\nSecurity Concerns:\nInstead of a password, the System keychain is secured using a key file at /private/var/db/SystemKey. When the system is running, all admin users have permission to access the keychain.\nThis isn't a security risk per se, but people often forget/overlook when enabling Time Machine that it's for the whole computer and not just their user account. Keep this in mind when choosing your Time Machine password not to use one that's very personal or private to you if you share adminship  (and, obviously, make sure you've enabled FileVault full disk encryption to prevent 3rd party access).\nAnother concern is that while including your password inline as an argument with -w avoids the interactive password prompt, it is also insecure as it will be saved in plaintext to your shell history (if you don't supress it) and in the output of commands like ps. And because you must specify the System keychain path as the last argument, it is very tricky to non-interactively add an item to the system keychain without exposing the password in this way.\nBut there is an alternate, albeit more involved solution for adding items to the user login keychain that avoids exposing your password:\n\nUsing expect to handle interactive password prompts:\nSince you can't pipe the password to security directly, you can instead specify -w as the last option and omit the password. This will make it prompt for a password, and then you can use expect to handle the interactive prompts programmatically - the caveat being you cannot specify which keychain to add the item to, so it will be added to the default login keychain.\nI'm not sure if this is within the scope of your question, but just in case, here's a quick and dirty expect script that allows you to non-interactively provide a password to the prompt:\n#!/usr/bin/env expect -f\n\n# Get passphrase piped through stdin\nfconfigure stdin -blocking false\nset PASSPHRASE [read stdin]\n\n# get the uuid of the disk image\nset IMAGE_PATH [lindex $argv 0]   \nspawn bash -c \"hdiutil isencrypted $IMAGE_PATH\"\nexpect {\n    -re \"\\[A-F0-9\\]{8}(-\\[A-F0-9\\]{4}){3}-\\[A-F0-9\\]{12}\" { set UUID $expect_out(0,string) }\n    -re \"hdiutil: isencrypted failed.*\" { exit 1 }\n    \"encrypted: NO\" { exit 1 }\n}\n\n# add password to keychain\nset send_slow {1 .1}\nspawn -noecho security add-generic-password -a $UUID -s \"[file tail $IMAGE_PATH]\" -D \"disk image password\" -T /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework/Versions/A/Resources/diskimages-helper -w\nexpect \"password data for new item:\"\nsend -s -- \"$PASSPHRASE\\r\"\nexpect \"retype password for new item:\"\nsend -s -- \"$PASSPHRASE\\r\"\n\nexpect eof\n\nFor example on how to run it, here I save it to a file hdiutilAddToKeychain.exp and pipe it a password from an imaginary function that you can substitute for however you get the password in your workflow:\n$ getPassword | ./hdiutilAddToKeychain.exp /path/to/example.sparsebundle\nThis should create the appropriate item in your login keychain, but the OS may still give you a GUI password prompt to allow access the first time you try to open it. I'm not aware of any way around this first time prompt.\nYou may also be able to use security's export and import subcommands to copy the password from your login keychain to the System keychain once it's been added this way.\n", "Q: Macbook early 2009: does it has a maximum SD memory allowed I have bought a couple of USB micro SD card readers. I have bought a couple of micro SD memories. None of them work well. The shop has told me that computers have a maximum memory allowed.\nI have not found anything like that anywhere. Is there a maximum memory allowed? It depends upon the computer? It depends upon the reader? Maybe it is just that the three micro SD memories where corrupted?\nBy the way, I have formatted the micro sd memory with the following tool:https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/ (OSX seems to be problematic to format because the compatibility with other devices. This association - software promises to solve that issue).\n\nA: There is an excellent Support Article on Apple's website that addresses this:  About the SD and SDXC card slot\n\nDoes the SD slot work with cards that exceed 32 GB?\nYes. However, most media manufactures preformat the media using common\nblock-and-cluster sizes that do not approach the theoretical limits of\na given file system. Most SD cards use the FAT32 file format.\nPreformatted FAT32 SD media is commonly available up to a capacity of\n32 GB. Media that exceeds 32GB usually uses the exFAT file system.\nSome smaller capacity cards use the FAT16 file format. Preformatted\nFAT16 media is generally available up to a capacity of 2 GB. To\ndetermine which file system you are using with Mac OS X v10.6.5 or\nlater, insert the media into the SD card slot, go to the Apple menu,\nselect About this Mac..., click on More info..., click on Card Reader\nin the hardware section, and locate the File System field.\n\n\n\nWhich SD card formats work in the SD card slot?\nCards that conform to the SD 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x standards should work.\nThe SD card slot can use cards that are Standard SD (Secure Digital) 4\nMB to 2 GB, SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) 4 GB to 32 GB, and\nSDXC  (Secure Digital Extended Capacity) 4G B to 2 TB. MMC can also be\nused in this slot. MiniSD, MicroSD, and higher density formats like\nMiniSDHC and MicroSDHC can also work with the use of \"passive\"\nadapters that conform to the width and thickness specifications listed\nabove.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nTo format your SD card, you should use Disk Utility either using the GUI or via Terminal.\nUsing Terminal:\ndiskutil eraseDisk HFS+ DiskName GPT /dev/diskN\nWhere...\n\n*\n\n*HFS+ = type of filesystem\n\n*DiskName = Name you want to give the SD card (i.e. \"Stuff\", \"My Photos\")\n\n*GPT = partition type\n\n*diskN = disk identifier (i.e disk4, disk7, etc.)\n\nFor more details, see man diskutil\n", "Q: Merge Spreadsheets [Numbers, macOS]\nI need to merge data in 2 spreadsheets / tables. Both of them contain contact information.

I don't really know how to put it, so feel free to ask any question!\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Let's make some assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The only column in Table 2 you care about is Website\n\n*All of the data in both Name columns is 100% correct and can be matched \"exactly\" (i.e. not fuzzily)\n\n*The columns are labeled with a \"header\" row (the dark gray background by default)\n\n*The tables are named Table 1 and Table 2\n\n*The data starts on row 2 in both tables\n\n\nTherefore we are simply going to take the desired values from Table 2::Website (Mac Numbers formula notation for \"Column Website in Table 2\") and plop them into Table 1::D.\nThis is actually very easy to do, and it's one of those standard spreadsheet tricks that's great to have in your back pocket. An Internet search for something like \"index match excel\" and \"vlookup excel\" will give you tons of results.\nNote for Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets users: write ! instead of ::, and put single-quotes ' around any table name with spaces in it. Should be the same result.\nSolution 1 (general technique)\nIn the first row of Table 1::Website, put this formula:\n=IFERROR(INDEX(Website, MATCH(A2, Table 2::Name, 0), 1), \"\")\n\nUnfortunately, because Numbers thinks it's smarter than you are, it won't let me paste this in -- you'll apparently have to type it by hand. Then click and drag the yellow dot on the bottom of the cell all the way down to the bottom.\nLet's unpack this from the inside out.\nMATCH\nOfficial documentation: http://help.apple.com/functions/mac/7.0/#/ffa59a83d3\nMATCH takes the following arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Value to search for\n\n*Range of values to search in\n\n*Search \"mode\"\n\n\nand returns the first position (1, 2, 3, etc.) in #2 that matches the value in #1. The documentation has more about argument #3, but 9 times out of 10 you will want to set it to 0, \nINDEX\nOfficial documentation: http://help.apple.com/functions/mac/7.0/#/ffa59b4edb\nINDEX takes the following arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*A range of cells to select from\n\n*A row in that range to select\n\n*A column in that range to select\n\n*An area number to use in the selected cell\n\n\nWe want to select from Table 2::Website, so that's what goes in to #1. The result of the MATCH call above gives us the row number we want, so that goes into #2. There's only one column in that range, so we know we want to put 1 into 3. If #4 is omitted, it defaults to 1. Don't worry about this, just leave it out.\nIFERROR\nOfficial documentation:\nIFERROR takes the following arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*A value to check for errors\n\n*A replacement value if there's an error\n\n\nThis one is self-explanatory. If INDEX fails, it will produce an error. Use this to replace those errors with blanks (or something else if you desire).\nSolution 2 (shortcut)\nYou can simplify this query with a shortcut function:\n=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, Table 2::Name:Website, 3, 0), \"\")\n\nWhat this does is \"vertically looks up\" A2 in the range Table 2::Name:Website and returns the value in column 3 that from the row it found. The 0 at the end specifies to look for an exact, rather than approximate, match. The IFERROR part is identical.\n", "Q: Mac freezes at startup at apple logo after permission changes I executed\nchmod go-rwx /\n\nCommand on my Macbook pro yosemite.

I have 2 monitors plugged into my MacBook Pro 2016, one via USB-C and another through a 5-port hub with HDMI. When the MacBook is not plugged in to power (through the hub) it seems to drain power very quickly. Would the monitors cause this? Thx.\n\nA: This is from both experience and speculation.\nMy MacBook Pro needs to be connected to power while the lid is shut in order to project the screen onto an external monitor. I imagine this is due to power limitations from the battery, as well as the need for greater power draw from the monitors. \nIf the lid is open, however, you can keep the power unplugged while still using monitors. This would certainly drain the battery faster, as the device now needs to project the display to one or more external monitors.\n\nA: Every device you plug into a USB port has a power requirement.\nSome are quite small in the milliamp range and some can be quite large, up to 5A of current.  The more devices, the more draw.\nWhen you have monitors hooked up via USB, it's your CPU that is actually driving the display as there is no separate video adapter.  Higher CPU cycles, more power draw.  As your CPU works harder, fans have to kick on - another device, more draw.\nSo, in short, yes, your monitors are causing the more rapid drain on your battery.\n", "Q: How can I download Mac OS X El Capitan without app store?

I also have a Windows computer, so I'm open to suggestions.\nHere's my Macbook Air Model:\nMacBook Air \"Core i5\" 1.4 13\" (Early 2014)\n\nA: You can't really download the OS X El Capitan installer app without the App Store.app easily. You can download the raw (unverified) pkg installer though, but to verify it and convert it to a legit OS X Installer.app App Store.app and a newer OS X system is required again. So simply downloading it on a Windows system won't help.\n\nTo solve your problem simply boot your MacBook Air to Internet Recovery Mode by holding altcmdR after turning it on.\nIn the OS X Utility window choose \"Reinstall OS X\" (or similar) which will download and install the original OS X your Mac came with (10.9 Mavericks).\nAfter configuring your system open App Store.app and download OS X El Capitan. If you haven't purchased it previously use the answer in How to download OS X El Capitan from the App Store even if never downloaded before macOS Sierra was released or purchased is grayed out.\n\nA: An bootable USB flash drive OS X El Capitan installer can be made by any of the three methods shown below. None of methods require use of the App Store.\n\n*\n\n*If you have a Windows machine, then see this question.\n\n\n*If you have Mac that is not capable of running OS X El Captain, then see this question.\n\n\n*If you have a Mac that is capable of running OS X El Capitan, then see this Apple website. The instructions are summarized below.\nDownload macOS\nThe installer for OS X El Capitan downloads to your Downloads folder as a disk image named InstallMacOSX.dmg. To get the installer:\n\n*\n\n*Download using Safari, and open the disk image on a Mac that is compatible with OS X El Capitan.\n\n\n*Inside the disk image is an installer named InstallMacOSX.pkg. It installs an app named \"Install OS X El Capitan\" into your Applications folder. You will create the bootable installer from this app, not from the disk image or .pkg installer.\nUse the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal\n\n*\n\n*Connect the USB flash drive or other volume that you're using for the bootable installer.\n\n\n*Open Terminal, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.\n\n\n*Type or paste one of the following commands in Terminal. These assume that the installer is in your Applications folder, and MyVolume is the name of the USB flash drive or other volume you're using. If it has a different name, replace MyVolume in these commands with the name of your volume.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nAfter typing the command:\n\n*\n\n*Press return to enter the command.\n\n*When prompted, type your administrator password and press return again. Terminal doesn't show any characters as you type your password.\n\n*When prompted, type Y to confirm that you want to erase the volume, then press return. Terminal shows the progress as the volume is erased.\n\n*After the volume is erased, you may see an alert that Terminal would like to access files on a removable volume. Click OK to allow the copy to proceed.\n\n*When Terminal says that it's done, the volume will have the same name as the installer you downloaded, as in Install OS X El Capitan. You can now quit Terminal and eject the volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: File metadata.json appears on desktop I apologize if this is impossible to debug, but this has been happening on my Mac with macOS Sierra 10.12.2 installed since a few weeks and I thought I'd give it a shot. \nBasically, a metadata.json file gets automagically created on my desktop.

I have about 12GB free and apparently that is not enough to install the app. What is weird is that I had about 6GB free and I deleted the old XCode which according to Finder was 12GB, and my new total available space is only 12GB. Is Finder totally rubbish at estimating disk space? When I go into about this Mac it tells me I have about 16GB of Apps and 21GB of \"Other\"\n\nWhen I look in my Applications folder I don't see anything close to 16GB:\n\nSame when I look for files that would account into Other, I am nowhere near that.

I've seen some instances where things were not completely removed.\nIn Terminal:\nrm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\n(Original answer)\nGo and grab the free OmniDiskSweeper app and run it. \nIt will help you see both the visible and hidden files on your system. Only remove those which you know that you do not need. You can easily corrupt the OS if you start moving system files without being certain what you are moving. Your caches may be taking up a lot of room somewhere. \nOmniDiskSweeper will help you find and eliminate files. If you have an external drive you could also just move some of the files over using Finder. Your disk seems incredibly small as it stands (50GB?).\nThere are hidden files elsewhere on your system. Usually under your home directory. If you are familiar with Terminal, you could try to change to the home directory and review the hidden folders.\ncd ~\nls .*\n\nIf you have an external USB you might want to use the symbolic link method to move the hidden folders and replace them with a symbolic link in that location:\nmv /path/to/original/foldername /Volumes/TargetDisk/path/to/moved/foldername\nln -s /Volumes/TargetDisk/path/to/moved/foldername foldername\n\nWhere \"foldername\" is the name of the folder you want to move and make a symbolic link. Only attempt this is you are very comfortable with Terminal. Otherwise just use OmniDiskSweeper. \nGood Luck.\n", "Q: Is magsafe 2 charger somehow associated with a Macbook by serial? My Magsafe2 charger just broke down. We have 2 Macbook Pros in house, and I can't be sure which is which. If it's my charger, I'll have to buy a new one. If it belongs to the other macbook - it should be still covered with Warranty. \nIs there a way to check if a charger belongs to a specific Macbook? Both chargers are model A1424 85W. Both laptops are Macbook Retina Pro, both year 2013 ( one early, the other late ).\n\nA: No. There is no serialization on chargers. If so, the 350 Mac laptops in many carts all over our campuses wouldn't charge because students (and some faculty) seem unable to read numbered slots and match the numbers on the laptops. Don't worry.\n", "Q: El Capitan's Disk Utility won't format new 3 TB drives higher than 800 GB My iMac Mid.2010 running OS X EL Capitan v10.11.6 will not format any of my brand new 2 x 3 TB SATA drives and although I tried any other format like exFat, etc, it keeps making them no higher than 800 gigs.  I do connect each drive to the iMac with a \"kdLinks HDD docking station\" and a SATA-to-USB2 interface cable. The purpose is to use these 2 drives for Time Machine backups. What am I doing wrong? \nUpdate:\n\nAlso: \n2017-01-14 12:59:38.663 defaults[9465:6786462] \nThe domain/default pair of (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist, MaxSize) does not exist\n\nAlso from mount:\n/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/OLDisk (hfs, local, journaled)\n/dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/SATADisk2 (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled)\n\n\nA: Your problem is probably related to the 2.2 TB (or 2 TiB) limit. Your disks either have an MBR (instead of a PMBR) or it's a limitation of the firmware of the kdLinks HDD disk station.\nCheck the disks after getting their disk identifiers with disktuil list with sudo gpt -r show diskX with diskX the disk identifiers of the external disks (e.g. disk1 and disk2).\nIf you get an output like this:\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: Suspicious MBR at sector 0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         MBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6\n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     .....\n\ndestroy the MBRs and add a proper GUID partition table.\nTo destroy the MBR and restore a proper GUID pt use:\ndiskutil umountDisk diskX\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX bs=512 count=1\n\nDestroy the GUID partition table and create a new one:\ndiskutil umountDisk diskX\nsudo gpt destroy diskX\nsudo gpt create -f diskX\n\nwith diskX: once more the disk identifiers of your external disks.\nBe sure to use the proper diskX or you may accidentally delete valid disks!\n\nAfter removing the MBR you often/sometimes have to completely eject the drive (or reboot your Mac) for the changes to take effect.\n\nUpdate:\nWith your partition data posted one can definitely say it's a 2 TiB problem:\nThe default size of the disk is 5,860,533,168 blocks. Your gpt output shows a size of 1,565,565,872 blocks. The difference is exactly 4,294,967,296 blocks which are 232 blocks or 2 TiB.\n\nA: Fire up terminal and do:\nsudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist MaxSize\nif it outputs a integer, like 1024000\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist MaxSize\ndiskutil list to see that this drive is visible, then create a \nnew hfs partition (put proper device where /dev/diskNumber is):\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskNumber 1 GPT HFS+ volumeName 100%\nParameters explained: 1 is the number of partitions, GPT is the table scheme, HFS+ is the filesystem and 100% is the Volume size. To format 1 HFS+ Volume on the entire drive you do: \ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskX 1 GPT HFS+ volumeName 100%\nTo get 2 partitions, each having 50% of your drive:\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk5 2 GPT HFS+ firstVolume 50% secondVolume HFS+ 50%\nIf you want just the GPT table without HFS formatting:\nchange HFS+ to %noformat% \nYou can try APFS, Apple's new HFS replacement, its still in-dev though and I don't know if ElCaptain supports it, and I definitely don't recommend it for a TM backup, still you can try if it creates the volume \ndiskutil apfs create /dev/diskNumber \nand you will get a warning message that's not very encouraging for backup but see if it creates the partition if HFS+ fails- you can reformat them.\nLet me know what kind of errors you get, and what defaults read tells about MaxSize (if any). Please paste any diskutil output somewhere if you have issues with partitioning. \nUpdate: Why the down votes people :(\n\nA: Please check the output of sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist MaxSize, its probably because that a system-wide MaxSize is set. \nThis command can't harm your system in any way- it will simply read \nthe value of MaxSize within your TimeMachine config .plist file.\ndiskutil command will also not harm your system- it is meant for partitioning (DiskUtility.app is a UI for it) and it is more verbose then DiskUtil. Let me know what those commands says. \nIf I remember right, there was some TM limit and 800gb sounds just right.\nYou can also post the whole TimeMachine configuration output, will be easier to check it for some clues:\nsudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist \nupdate please, post the output from diskutil list and mount as well.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro CPU throttling I'm new user of a brand new 15\" Mid 2015 MacBook Pro (i7 processor), which I got about a month ago. I've been having problems with performance.\nEvery time I try to do anything more CPU consuming than browsing the internet (for example opening a project in IntelliJ or compiling a Java project), my Mac becomes extremely slow.\nI noticed that CPU is working on 800 MHz frequency but CPU temperature is low. Fans stay quiet all the time (~2000 rpms). When I need power from my CPU it slows down, but I don't think it should.\n\nI also tried live USB Ubuntu and I simulated some load and the result was the same, you can see it on the screen.\n\nI also tried SMC reset but no result. Does it look like hardware failure?\nExample of Activity monitor processes listing while throttling below. After longer build Idle is almost 0%, temperature is okay, frequency is 800MHz. Process kernel_task is sometimes using much more CPU\n\n\nA: In my case opening MacBook and cleaning it from dust helped reduce throttling from 800Mhz to 1600MHz which is still not advertised speed , but at least twice as better :) Also I've noticed that in my case such throttling occured only with external monitor and external GPU. You can use gfxCardStatus to monitor which GPU and which processes require external GPU.\n", "Q: What cable do I need for 2560 x 1440 resolution on my Mac Air mid 2013?

Is there an adaptor I can purchase that will bring my monitor up to 2560 x 1440? Thank you!\n\nA: You need an HDMI cable that conforms to the HDMI 1.3 (minimum) specification.  When looking for this adapter, be sure to specify \"4K\" so that it brings up relevant results.  The Plugable Active Mini DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 Adapter will work for your application.\nThat doesn't guarantee that you will display 2560x1440.  Your monitor must support it as well.\nReviewing the specs of the MacBook Air, it will support resolutions on an external monitor of up to 2560x1600 so you will have no problem here.\n", "Q: What steps can be taken to recover from rm -rf ~ Asking for a friend.\nImagine that one has accidentally created a file named ~ and in the process of deleting it, foolishly types:\nrm -rf ~\n\nLuckily, I have active terminal windows open, so all is not entirely lost.

I've recovered some of my .bash_profile by looking at env, alias, and typeset -f but I'm sure I'm missing parts of it.\n\nA: rm is one of those dangerous commands where to \"Err is human, but to really foul things up, you need a computer.\"  rm immediately deletes the files and bypasses the Trash...you don't pass \"Go\" and you don't \"collect $200.\"\nYour best bet is to.... \n\n\n*\n\n*Stop using the machine as in ASAP.  The more your use it, the more disk activity, the less of a chance of recovery.\n\n*Look at getting something like DiskDrill.  It's free to use but the actual recovery will cost around $100.  There are others, but I found this one works really well for me.\n\n*Start a Time Machine regimen and adhere to it.\n\nA: If you are sure that only files/folder starting with a dot are gone you are actually quite safe. Hardly anything on macOS relies on such files. If you want to recover the defaults, create a new user account and copy any missing stuff from there. \nThe key issues probably come from the init files of your shell and your ssh configuration.

When it does, choose File > Devices > Transfer Purchases from [your iPad's name].\nUnfortunately, depending on how much content you have on your iPad, this may be fairly overkill... using this method will sync all purchased content from the iTunes Store to your computer, as well as \"all podcasts from your device's Podcasts app and copies of all PDFs, books, and audiobooks from your device's iBooks app\" (source).\nOnce the transfer is complete, your PDFs and other ebooks will appear in the Books app on your Mac, and you can drag and drop the file into Dropbox or wherever else you want it.\niCloud Drive\nFirst, you need to make sure that the following things are set up properly, both in iCloud settings on your iPad (Settings > iCloud) and on your Mac  ( > System Preferences > iCloud):\n\n\n*\n\n*You are logged into iCloud\n\n*iCloud Drive is turned on\n\n*iBooks is turned on within iCloud Drive settings\n\n\nHaving checked that, open iBooks on your iPad and wait a moment. If there is a cloud icon in the top right, that means it's busy syncing your documents. (You can tap on it to see what it's currently syncing.) Wait for it to finish.\nNow open iBooks on your Mac and wait patiently for the PDF to appear. Make sure that View > Hide iCloud Books is not ticked.\nOnce the PDF is synced to your computer, simply drag and drop the file into Dropbox or wherever else you want it.\nNote that this method can be a bit temperamental and may not work, even if it seems like everything is set up correctly. If it doesn't, and this is your only option, try rebooting your devices and follow the steps again.\n\nA: I figured out that my file was too big to be sent by email. I had a lot of photographs in it.

The only device I'm signed in on is my phone, yet everything is still synced? I was wondering how to unsync both devices completely?\n\nA: Changing Apple ID won't remove previous messages received, only future messages. In the Messages app, you will have to manually delete each conversation to remove the message history.\n", "Q: Stocks app crashes on launch after moving from iPhone to iPad on iOS 6.1.3 I want to port the Stocks app from iPhone to iPad. I transferred Stocks.app and the relevant frameworks files from iPhone 4 iOS 6.1.3 to iPad 2 iOS 6.1.3. The files are zipped via iFile on iPhone and unzipped into the right directories when the files are on iPad 2 so that the proper file permission can be preserved. Weather, compass and voice memo works, however this Stocks always crash at opening.\n\n\nA: The crash log shows that /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Stocks.framework/Stocks can't be loaded because it can't be found. Make sure you have copied the entire Stocks.framework into the correct location with identical permissions applied (unzipping in iFile will not preserve permissions so you'll need to set them yourself recursively).\n", "Q: Time Machine backup size seems to be too small It is my understanding that Time Machine does not compress as it backs up and that it backs up everything (at least in default mode). \nWhy then is the space-used stat given by Finder re my external hard drive to which I backed up my iMac's (OS X 10.9.5) internal drive much lower/less than the same stat in re my internal drive from which I backed up. The difference is 354.39 GB on internal vs. 85.83 GB on external.\nMy first backup took only about 40 minutes, which surprises me - thought would be like 4 hours, so I am wondering if it was complete and successful.  However, all the files on my internal do seem to be on the external, and I got not messages indicating that there was a problem. It has been backing up hourly since that initial backup without any problems apparently.  \nShouldn't those stats be the same?\n\nA: Time-machine does not back up your entire Harddrive. It excludes most of the OS files and backups to your internal harddrive.\nIt is possible, that you didn't notice, that your data got accidentially backed up to your internal drive. You can check it as follows.\nTo see how much space those local Time Machine backups are consuming, click the Apple icon on the menu bar, click About This Mac, and click the Storage heading. The “Backups” category here represents your local snapshots.\nYou can disable that through the terminal:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\nEdit: It will then automatically purge the already created local backups\n\nA: You may be excluding some content.\nYou can tell Time Machine to exclude one or more folders. Look at System Preferences > Time Machine > Options (button) > Private.\nSome apps may indicate to Time Machine that files should be omitted from the backup. One example is the Parallels virtual machine app. Each VM file can be many gigs, so collecting a history of those would quickly swamp your Time Machine volume. So Parallels provides a flag you can set on each VM to ignore in Time Machine. This setting defaults to ignoring in Time Machine.\n", "Q: Fixing error 73 AND Open Directory without Internet I have been messing with an old PowerMac G4 running OSX 10.5 Leopard Server trying to get Open Directory running on a small network I set up for testing purposes. I can't find anything useful online about my specific situation.\nMy network hasn't got, and never will have, an internet connection, but I have multiple Mac machines connected either through Ethernet or WiFi.\nI found on the internet that I would need a DNS server with a forward and reverse lookup name and so I set the DNS service up with a hostname I randomly picked. I don't think the fact I randomly picked a name matters because the network will be offline. Is this wrong?\nWhen I try to set up an Open Directory master, I get:\n\"This server has not been configured as an Open Directory Master. Error has Occurred! Error value = 73\"\nWhen running sudo changeip -checkhostname I get:\nPrimary address = 192.168.1.15  \nCurrent Hostname = PowerMac.exampledomain.net  \nDNS Hostname = PowerMac.exampledomain.net  \nThe names match. There is nothing to change.\n\nI do not get dirserv:success = \"success\". Does this cause error 73? \nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: I've now managed to solve my errors and such. I will now explain how to fix error 73 and how to set your server up as an OD Master. Hopefully someone else will find this useful and save themselves many months of pain trying to resolve their issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, we need to completely reset the database. To do this, we will open up terminal and enter sudo slapconfig -destroyldapserver. The OD service should be reset now. To ensure changes take effect we need to reboot the system. Don't skip this part.\n\n*Next we need to configure DNS. Make a new domain on the local network and add the to-be-OD master's local ip address as an A record. Make sure the reverse record also matches up. If this doesn't make sense to you then you need to look up how to set DNS up. Make sure you click the Start DNS button to start up the service.\n\n*Now add the local DNS server to your router's DNS output so that your router gives all DHCP connected devices your DNS servers local IP address. To allow external internet connections, you may want to add another DNS server to your local one, so any invalid addresses can be tried for a non-authoritative answer.\n\n*Go back to terminal and type in sudo changeip -checkhostname. If there are any issues then follow the example given to fix your machines host name.\n\n*Reboot again if you had to make changes. If not then skip the next step.\n\n*Redo the last two steps.\nWe now have to fix LDAP permissions causing error 73: \n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal type sudo mkdir -m755 /var/db/openldap.\n\n*Reboot yet again...\nLastly we can now create the OD server following some of the strict rules explained below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Server Admin, choose Open Directory, under General, click Change...\n\n*Choose Master.\nEnsure you do not use any account details which are associated with a local machine account in the Master Domain Administrator account fields.\n\n*Click continue.\n\n*Under Kerberos Realm type in your machines new DNS host name.\n\n*Click continue.\n\n*Click continue.\nBe greeted with the success message and a working OD Master .\nI hope this helped someone. Feel free to remake my guide in a better form and reply with it.\n", "Q: How to show desktop files on both screens? I have a dual monitor setup. Files in the desktop are shown on the first screen. Is there a way to have those files also appear (mirrored) on the second screen?\nI do not want screen mirroring, I just want to mirror desktop files. Is that possible?\n\nA: I'd like to do the same thing, but I haven't found a way. The best compromise I could come up with was to move the menu bar to my primary display. By moving the menu bar, I changed the display which shows my dock and desktop files.\nYou can move the menu bar by dragging white bar in the Arrangement settings from one display to another:\n\n\nA: This worked for me to move the dock at the bottom of the screen with icons from one screen to another (not the folders though): Move your mouse arrow to the very bottom of the display where you want your dock to appear and hover it there for a couple seconds. The dock will move off your primary display and appear on your other display.\n\nA: I've got the same problem.  The way I always did it before is by making shortcuts (aliases) and sticking those on the 2nd screen.\nThis worked fine, but now my desktop is synced up to iCloud, it means my macbooks have both the original folders and the aliases on the desktop which clutters it up.\nWhat I might do is make a folder called DESKTOP on the 2nd screen and put all the aliases in that so I only have one extra folder on the macbooks.\nI also wish I could get open windows and apps to stay in the same place on the correct monitor when I switch it on.\nBut it's a pity that you can't visually hide folders from being displayed on the desktop.\nThere should be a way you can CMD+I a folder and click a box saying \"Don't display on desktop\" like \"hide file extension.\"  But you'd still be able to see the folder in Finder.\nYou could then have more folders on the desktop syncing to iCloud without cluttering up the space.\nBut if you do find a workaround, please let us know.\n", "Q: My MacBook keeps crashing My Mac keeps crashing with the same error:\n\na freed zone element has been modified in zone kalloc.64\n\nHere are four crash reports I collected over a period of time.\nIt happens no matter what I'm doing, using the terminal, the browser, even when the screensaver is on.\nI did try disabling avira real time scan (didn't exit) but that didn't stop the crashing.\nThis is driving me nuts, any ideas?\n\nA: It's hard to say from the crash reports, the good news is that the issue may be related to software - a misbehaving third party kernel module may cause a kernel panic.\nFrom you crash reports I see the following 3rd party module:\ncom.avira.kext.FileAccessControl\n\nTry updating or removing avira, and see if that helps.\n", "Q: Can CCC clone a Fusion drive and restore it to a new SSD? I have a 2012 Mac Mini with a 1TB Fusion drive. The noise of the spinning disk has been increasing lately and I want to replace it with a Crucial MX300 1TB SSD. \nCarbon Copy Cloner makes a complete image of my machine nightly. Can I use the latest clone and restore it to the SSD? Is it advised or would the removal of the Fusion drive require a clean install of macOS (Sierra)? I was wondering if the boot files would be different from using a Fusion drive, for example, or if anything would need a change in some settings files. \nI seem to remember that the version of OS X Yosemite was a little bit different between my Mini and my MacBook Air and that was due to the Fusion drive (couldn't download OS X on the Mini and boot it from a USB drive on the Air).\n\nA: In answer to your question: YES.\nBy way of explanation... CCC makes a copy of the file system, which is independent of what physical drives the file system is on. for example you could make a clone of a boot drive on a RAID-5 array and then restore it to a single drive with no problems. \nThe file system doesn't change just because it is on a different kind of physical media.\n", "Q: How to use 'cut' with null delimiter This question basically is exactly the same as this question in Stackoverflow.\nUsing the syntax of cut the specification cut -d '' file should actually work and (given the answers to the question) it seems to work on Linux systems.

I have tried to do so with VirtualBox, and it works on the main VirtualBox window properly. The only issue is that when I launch a virtual machine, those settings lose their effect. The reason is that VirtualBox launches a differently-named executable file (from within its app bundle) in order to run the virtual machine in a separate process. \nSo, the question is: Is there a way to set up macOS to show the function buttons when running a virtual machine in VirtualBox (e.g. Linux or Windows)?\n\nA: http://www.mastropaolo.com/2016/12/16/how-to-have-function-keys-in-virtualbox-guess-with-macos-touchbar/\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open a Finder window to the /Applications folder.

Can I feed another MBP by USB-C cable from a port on the first laptop?\nPower packs can deliver 1.5A (at 220V = 330W) over USB-C to the MBP. MBP power requirement is 4.3A (@ 20.2V = 87W). So seems the power pack can handle it.\nAh but port delivers  900 mA (Milliamps) at 5 V = 4.5W. So guessing answer is no. But my amateur electronics may be wrong so confirmation appreciated.\n\nA: The USB-C Specification specifies power delivery of up to 100W.\n\nIncreased power levels from existing USB standards up to 100W.\n\nYou won't be able to \"daisy chain\" or more technically, charge MacBooks in series as 100W will be less than the required 174W (87W * 2).

There have been Thunderbolt 3 performance differences between left and right ports on some models, so it seems there are also power delivery differences as well.\n\nA: I support @Fasani 's answer.\nAfter tests of daisy-chaining newly bought MacBook Pro (model A1990 EMC 3215) with ASUSPRO (b9440UA) I concluded that you can't daisy chain 20V USB-C power supply, however you try.\nBut\nMacBook Pro is very aggressive in getting whatever power is available to it, so it will eagerly use 5V if that is all it can get. Of course, with reduced wattage. And of course, daisy-chaining USB-C must deliver at least 5V, because it is in the minimal USB-C specs.\nASUS B9440UA tolerates only 20V power, so no daisy-chaining those.\n\nA: I'm doing it right now.

I am currently at a conference without my charger and I have daisy chained my Mac to another Mac (both USB-C 2017 Mac Book Pros). Both Mac's are closed, so there is not much variance in usage as both are idle. I opened the screens and checked the power level on both every 10 minutes. The second Mac charged much slower and seemed to charge faster once the first Mac was fully charged, but it still seemed slower than normal to charge.\n---------------------------\n| Time    | Mac 1 | Mac 2 |\n---------------------------\n| 0  mins | 81%   | 22%   |\n---------------------------\n| 10 mins | 89%   | 24%   |\n---------------------------\n| 20 mins | 96%   | 26%   |\n---------------------------\n| 30 mins | 100%  | 29%   |\n---------------------------\n| 40 mins | 100%  | 33%   |\n---------------------------\n| 50 mins | 100%  | 37%   |\n---------------------------\n| 60 mins | 100%  | 42%   |\n---------------------------\n\n", "Q: iPhone reports 2 Hotspot connections even though only one of my devices is connected I connected to an iPhone Hotspot with a MacBook.

If your startup tone does not match exactly one of the ones listed, please comment back and say so and describe which one it is closest to and what the difference is. Unfortunately, not all of the possible startup tones are listed on that page.\n\nA: This is a common problem seen with MacBook Pro 13\" pre-2012. It is a result of the logic board not being able to read the RAM. In this particular model it can often be caused by pressure, over time, on the bottom case thusly, causing pressure on the logic board. This issue is solved with a Logic Board replacement and in some rare cases the bottom case. To test it yourself, see if you can cause a kernel panic or freeze while applying some pressure to the center/slightly right side (from the top) of the bottom case.\nTo avoid this issue with these MacBook Pros do not make it a habit on using uneven surfaces (knees for example) or picking the unit up with one hand. Additionally, try not to transport it in something with other heavy objects that can apply pressure to the bottom case.\nIf the Mac does not freeze when applying pressure, you can test the RAM by following these steps:\nYou could test another, less likely scenario; one RAM slot on the Mac is faulty. \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove a RAM stick and using the Mac with one RAM stick in only one slot. \n\n*If the issue reoccurs, remove the RAM and place it in the other slot. \n\n*If the issue reoccurs a second time, use the other RAM stick. \n\n*If the issue reoccurs a third time, then it is 100% a logic board problem, and it will not improve without replacement.\n\n\nIf at any point the issue does not reoccur with one of the RAM sticks, use that combination of that RAM stick in the working slot only. The Mac will work fine with . only one RAM stick as long as it is > 2GB. You could also upgrade it a larger capacity RAM stick.\nHow to remove RAM support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201165 \n\nA: USE codykrieger GFXCARDSTATUS\nThe NvidiaCard are wrong in all of MacbookPro... :( i sucked it but i found the solve!

Can relay off of it from other hosts on my network; telnet to it on port 25 etc.\nHow do I get it to auto start such that It will always be listening on port 25?\nI understand it starts up every minute or so and sends whatever has been manually written to the queue (like with the mail command) but I want it listening for connections on port 25 (Which it does if I start it manually).\nI've found a bunch of things online but can't get any to work (they seem to apply to previous versions of OS X).\n\nA: To get this working on Sierra you have to modify the existing launch daemon slightly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable SIP\n\n*Modify /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist:\nsudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist\n\nremove the lines:\n<string>-e</string>\n<string>60</string>\n\nadd the lines:\n<key>KeepAlive</key>\n<true/>\n\nsave the file and exit nano\n\n*Reload the launch daemon:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist\n\n\n*Enable SIP\n\nA: I'm running macOS Catalina.\nI copied com.apple.postfix.master.plist from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ to /Library/LaunchDaemons as @Johnson suggested in his answer. I then proceeded to make the changes specified by @klanomath in his answer.\nOn running sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist, I got this: service already loaded. I tried unloading the service but SIP would not allow it.\nAfter some more searching, I found https://github.com/alexzhangs/macos-postfix-autostart. This repo is no longer maintained but the author said that postfix service will be started on demand when calling sendmail.\nI've tested and confirmed this works. So you really don't have to auto start postfix in newer OS'.\n\nA: It is not necessary or recommended to modify plists in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons\n– rather make a copy in /Library/LaunchDaemons and modify that.\n\nA: I needed a daemon listening on port 25 for local clients, so I still had to do the local LaunchDaemon setup on Catalina.  The basic technique in the github scripts still works without having to hack around the protections.  Using sudo, copy over the default one to /Library/LaunchDaemons and rename the file and change the Label value inside the file; what you call it doesn't matter.  I used the name org.postfix.custom.plist.  I removed the 60 second exit params and set RunAtLoad and KeepAlive LaunchDaemon keys to true.  That worked for me.\nI have the following in my /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.custom.plist file.

I want to be separate from his account but still be able to keep the music we have jointly accumulated and paid for over the years.\nis there any way this can be done? or will he gain custody of our library?   \n\nA: Yes, there is a way for you both to still share the music you have jointly accumulated and paid for over the years. However, this can only happen with his agreement.\nBasically it involves the use of Family Sharing. \nThe way you would set this up is to create a separate Apple ID for yourself (which you want to do anyway) and then invite him to be part of your Family Group (or he could create one and invite you to his).\nNow, despite the above Apple page stating that all members of the Family Group pay for family purchases with the same credit card, the way to get around this is to ensure you have credit on your account (via gift cards). Below is an example of how this works.\nEXAMPLE\nYou create an Apple ID and then create a Family Group. You then invite your Ex to be a part of that Family Group and technically this means that you agree to pay for any purchases they make via iTunes, iBooks, and the App Store. However, if your Ex has credit on his Apple ID (via iTunes gift cards) then any purchases they make directly using their Apple ID will come off their account credit. In other words, it would never come off your credit card unless they no longer had enough credit to cover the purchase. Of course, the roles could be reversed (i.e. he creates the Family Group and technically covers your purchases). Another option would be to just set up a specific debit card (e.g. Visa Debit Card) that is used for nothing else but your Family Sharing and, because it's a debit card (i.e. not a credit card), it can only spend money that's already in the account. You could each agree to put x$ into it every month etc to maintain it.\nNow, I should point out that besides the fact you would both have to agree to this, this approach also means when you purchase music, an iBook, app, etc that he will be able to also download and use it (unless the author/developer has opted not to allow family sharing for that particular product). This may not be a big deal, or it may be (especially if you're concerned about privacy) because they will be able to see what you've purchased (if they go looking at the Purchased tab within iTunes, iBooks, the App Store, etc) unless you've manually chosen to hide it. Also, going down this path means you may want to selectively choose what you do activate at your end (e.g. you may not want to share your location, photos, etc).\nFor more information refer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Family Sharing\n\n*10 Things to Know Before Enabling Apple's Family Sharing\n", "Q: Upgrading and restoring hard drives in mid-2011 Mac Mini Server I've just completed the install procedure for two, 2TB hard drives in my mid-2011 Mac Mini server. The server had been 'downgraded' to just run regular Mac OS Sierra on one 750 GB drive, with the second 750GB drive for data. Both drives in the machine were backed up to a single, 2TB external drive using Time Machine.\nI created a bootable install disk for Sierra and booted from there once the new drives were installed. Pulled up disk utility, but it was only seeing one of the two new drives. So, my first question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should the computer have seen both drives, or only the drive in whatever the '1st slot' would be?\n\n\nAlso, I've just started a restore process from disk utility. I was already in that tool to format the drive that it could see, so I just went ahead and hit restore from the Time Machine backup to the drive I formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Second and third questions are:\n\n\n*Should I have actually used time machine instead? (restore is in progress, can't seem to cancel) What's the difference?\n\n*Would it have been better to install Sierra and then restore from time machine?\nThe restore from Disk Utility seems to be doing it's thing..(says it's restoring)\n\nA: To answer your questions as numbered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes the computer should have seen both drives. Have you checked to make sure the drives are properly seated and the SATA cable plugged in properly?\n\n*I would always suggest doing a clean install of the OS and using Migration Assistant instead of Time Machine (you can do a Migration from a Time Machine backup) because anything that's currently associated with the UUID or anything else specific to the old HDDs may be weird when it recognizes the new drives as being different. Migration assistant fixes these problems and makes sure any app licenses transfer properly.\n\n*As I stated in my answer number 2, I would argue yes, with some changes.\nIf I were you, I would take the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would try to figure out why my second HDD wasn't showing up. If necessary, I'd take the computer apart and replug its SATA cable.\n\n*Once I had both HDDs working, I'd format both of them to their final formats (likely HFS+).\n\n*I'd do a clean install of MacOS Sierra.\n\n*After setting up the computer, I would use spotlight to open the Migration Assistant app and migrate from that time machine backup.\n\n*Once the migration was complete, I would make time machine back up all of the data. This way, all of the new, migrated information has a backup.\n", "Q: Can't load a specific webpage using Chrome or Safari while logged in, but they work on other account and Firefox also works I'm trying to access The Guardian's website, and I get errors with both Safari and Chrome.\nIn Safari:\n\nSafari Can't Open the Page\nSafari can't open the page \"https://www.theguardian.com\" because Safari can't establish a secure connection to the server \"www.theguardian.com\".\n\nIn Chrome:\n\nYour connection is not private\nAttackers might be trying to steal your information from theguardian.com (for example, passwords, messages or credit cards).

These caches are not deleted by deleting anything from ~/Caches, which is why the issue didn't resolve when I tried that.\nThe answer came from the Apple Developer Forums, who pointed me to a page on the GlobalSign website. The solution is to open Command Prompt/Terminal and enter one of the following commands, then reboot.\nWindows\ncertutil -urlcache * delete\n\nOS X (pre-Sierra)\nsudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db\n\n macOS Sierra\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3 'DELETE FROM ocsp;'\n\n\nA: Typing thisisunsafe (not in the address bar, but just on the page) whitelists the url/cert.\nI'm using this workaround on sites I know to be legit (server cluster nodes with names that are different than the VIP they serve.)

How can I transfer the files from the dead external hard drive to another external hard drive? Please help before I throw it trough the window. Many thanks \n\nA: There are two possibilities. \n\n\n*\n\n*The disk itself has failed. You now need a high-powered recovery program like Data Rescue, or a service like DriveSavers. Cost is about $100 for the first and $1000 for the second.\n\n*The case has a problem. Given that it's a Buffalo case I think this is more likely (their products are rather low quality).

For the computer to keep contact with the domain controller, the DNS server needs to be set to the IP address of that controller.  However, since we are talking about a laptop, it often goes off-site where so that DNS server is not available.  In Windows, this is a very easy fix as the DNS settings are customized for different networks.  I cannot figure out how to do this for macOS without manually changing it when I need to.\n\nA: My Macbook is also bound to a AD domain, but I do not have any such DNS issues. DNS settings are configurable per network connection type in System Preferences. System Preferences>Network>Advanced>DNS.\nSimply edit (if allowed?) the DNS entry for the connection type. You can have more than two DNS entries, so for example, you might simply ADD Google DNS to the work DNS. In this case, if the work DNS are not available, it will fail-over to Google DNS.\nYou could do this for all network types, or perhaps just for wifi, if you use a hardline at work.\n", "Q: Unable to add more than 1 static route I'm trying to add multiple persistent static routes using the networksetup command.

I seldom use both screens at the same time. I wanted to have different backgrounds for my ultra-wide and laptop.\nBut if I turn both on and try to set the background for one and another, when I close my laptop, the wide screen monitor gets the not-so-wide background. \nIf I set a ultra-wide background in my monitor with the laptop closed, when I open the laptop, it gets the ultra-wide background, and the monitor gets another background.\nCan I sepcifically set the backgrounds for the monitors?\nI use a MacBook Pro Retina, running El Capitán.\nA similar question\n\nA: You could try the following as a workaround that may meet your needs. Before proceeding, make sure you are also connected to your external display. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mission Control\n\n*If you haven't previously set up additional desktop spaces before, then click on the + sign at the top right of the screen to create a new desktop space\n\n*Now enter the new desktop space by selecting it (via the top of the screen)\n\n*Set the background image you would like for the ultra-wide screen on this desktop space\n\n*Open Mission Control again\n\n*Now enter the first desktop space by selecting it from top centre of screen\n\n*Set the background image you would like for your laptop screen on this desktop space\n\n\nSo far, what we've done is created an additional desktop space and allocated a unique image to each as a desktop background.\nThe trick that may work is to now assign certain apps to the space for the ultra wide screen. This is because if you use an additional screen and have apps running on it you will have an additional space for that screen. \nSo, in your case, let's say you usually use the ultra wide screen for iMovie. You can allocate iMovie so that it works on the second desktop space. Here are the basic steps to doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the app in your Dock and keep the mouse button down (if you don't keep it in your Dock, then just launch it first)\n\n*From the submenu move the mouse pointer to Options \n\n*You'll see you now have a number of options for where the App should display. In this example you'll want to select Desktop on display x (where x will be a '1' or '2').\n\n\nThe idea behind all this is that if you only use your ultra-wide screen when you're using certain apps, then you can automate some of this workflow. You can also add more apps to work on this screen by default.\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*For this to work as described, ensure the Mission Control System Preference Pane has Displays have separate Spaces enabled.\n\n*This also assumes that Mirror Displays is off in your Displays System Preferences.\n\n\nHopefully you'll find something in all of this that works for you (or comes close).

Lately I had problems restarting my MacBook. After restart, the keyboard and mouse froze at login, making it impossible to login or do anything. It appeared that the solution was to disable FileVault in recovery mode. After that I could login and it all seemed to work. \nSee MacBook startup problems - mouse and keyboard not working at login / stuck on apple logo\nNot long after that I thought to enable Filevault again, and so I did. This was not a good idea. I enabled it, I saw a recovery code that I copied into my Keepass database on the Mac, and restarted. Right after that I got the same problem with frozen keyboard and mouse. So I tried to go back by disabling FileVault, except now my password didn't work anymore. \nWhen I enabled FileVault, no password was asked, so I assumed it would use the same password as I use for login. It works not that way. I can go into recovery mode, enter my password, which works, then try to unlock the disk, which doesn't work. It says: incorrect password.\nBackups\nI do have several backups, with Time Machine and I have an image of the system disk copied to another disk. This is encrypted as well of course, but that is from before disabling and enabling FileVault, so the old password should work there. I tried to restart pressing C to select the startup disk, but that didn't work as intended.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I startup from that other disk? I could even use a clean disk with a fresh system if needed.\n\n*What happened to the password when enabling FileVault?\n\n*Is there another way to fix the password issue?\n\n*Can I make a backup of the system disk before erasing it, if I decide to reinstall? If necessary I can even boot into Linux. If so, how?\n\n\nA: I had an image of the system disk on an external harddisk. This image was encrypted. I started up in recovery mode with this disk connected, and selected it as boot partition. \nAfter rebooting, it turned out that the problem I had with booting an encrypted partition happened once again. I rebooted once again into recovery mode, then selected this partition, and selected the bottom option (keyboard not working when trying to login). This option decrypts the partition. Another restart, and I could login to the system on this external partition. \nOnce logged in, I could unlock the internal system disk, which was not possible anymore after I re-enabled encryption last week. Now I could use Superduper to copy the internal disk to a second external disk, which is unencrypted. After completing this, I could reboot from this disk, which was an up-to-date system. This is a rather slow HDD, even with USB3, compared to the internal SSD. Booting takes ages. \nHaving this setup, I could copy the system back to the internal SSD, unencrypted. \nThis Macbook Pro Retina (2015) has 2xUSB3 and an internal 120GB SSD. The setup was as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacOS: System disk: 1st external HDD via USB3 (this is an older backup)\n\n*SSD: Not working internal system disk: 120GB internal SSD\n\n*Backup: 2nd external HDD via USB3\n\n\nSuperduper actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unencrypt 1st external disk, because it wouldn't work encrypted as well. \n\n*Superduper copy encrypted SSD to unencrypted Backup disk, running MacOS on 1st external disk.\n\n*Remove 1st external disk and startup from backup disk which now has a copy of the internal system. \n\n*Superduper copy of external backup HDD to internal SSD, unencrypted.\n\n\nThe second step took 3 hours for 100GB. I then removed some folders which were not important, after which 80GB remained. It took 16 hours to complete step 4. I don't understand this, but I'll create another question about this. \nAll in all, I have a working system right now, although unencrypted, and for the time being I'm not going to encrypt again. Options are to create an external test SSD with a copy of the current OS, stripped down, encrypt that and see how that works out. Another option is to install from scratch, encrypted, and see how that works out, while keeping a synced SSD available. \n", "Q: Using Command Line how to make the user an Administrator As soon I bind a Mac to the AD Domain, I usually log into the Mac with the user account. \nOf course, under System Preference, User & Groups, the user account is marked as: Managed, Mobile\nMy second step, is to make the user an Administrator account because I want to allow him/her to install/remove stuff from her/his Mac.\nSo, with the GUI, System Preferences > Users & Groups > I select the user name and I check mark the option: enable Allow user to administer this computer and I restart the machine and everything works fine.

I have a .txt file that I open regularly on my Mac. I would like the TextEdit window of this .txt file to be wider than it normally is.\nI can manually increase the window width every time I open the file by left-clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner further to the right. But, it would be much more convenient if the window was wider by default.\n\nI have tried adjusting the TextEdit window size while holding down the shift key.\nI have tried adjusting the TextEdit window size while holding down the  ⌘ command key.\nI have tried adjusting the TextEdit window size while holding down the control key.\nAfter quitting TextEdit and then re-opening the .txt file, none of the above methods recall the previously-set window size.\n\nI am also open to a method that uses AppleScript to set the window size before the file is opened. Here's the AppleScript command that I currently employ to open the file:\ndo shell script \"open -e \" & quoted form of Target_Filepath\n\n\nA: Instead of changing the default windows size, unless you want to make it permanent and you can just change it in TextEdit > Preferences... then, you can use the following example AppleScript code to open the document in TextEdit and set its size and position on the screen.\nFirst, open the target file, resize and position it on the screen where you want it and the use the following AppleScript code to get the bounds of the document window to use going forward.\ntell application \"TextEdit\" to get bounds of front window\n\nIt will return a list, e.g.: {0, 22, 900, 600}, to use with the set bounds ... command.\nset targetFile to POSIX path of (path to documents folder) & \"Filename.txt\"\n\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    activate\n    open targetFile\n    set bounds of front window to {0, 22, 900, 600}\nend tell\n\n\nNote: The reason I'm suggesting the above method is because while one can technically change the default size of the document window programmatically nonetheless since TextEdit doesn't support a position property it makes sense to use the bounds property as the first two list items in the bounds property  are its position.\nHowever, if you really want to change the default size prior to opening the target document regardless of it position, here is the information surrounding the default window size. Under TextEdit > Preferences... > New Document > Window Size the default Width is 90 characters and the default Height is 30 lines. With these defaults there are no keys in the com.apple.TextEdit.plist file for this however the corresponding keys are WidthInChars and HeightInChars, which support an integer value.\nYou'd need to test for the existence of these keys and capture their values so as to have something to reset to after opening the target document. If they are the true defaults, the keys will not exist and you can temporarily set a integer value for these keys, open the target document and then delete the keys. The target document window will open with the new values at the default location of TextEdit's choice, not yours. If you want it in a different location you'd need to use set bounds ..., which defeats programmatically temporarily changing the defaults or the existing setting if not the default values.\nExample code using the defaults command:\ndefaults read $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist WidthInChars\ndefaults read $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist HeightInChars\n\ndefaults write $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist WidthInChars -int 120\ndefaults write $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist HeightInChars -int 50\n\ndefaults delete $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist WidthInChars\ndefaults delete $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist HeightInChars\n\nThese can be used in a do shell script command using set variableName to do shell script \"defaults read ...\" and then write the logic flow based on what's returned.\nIf you really want to go this route and need help with the coding, let me know.\nAlso note that testing surrounding this was done under macOS 10.12 and may be different in previous major OS version releases.\n", "Q: Is this a normal fan speed and CPU temperature for an idle MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) Is this a normal fan speed and CPU temperature for an idle MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015).

with this problem. I have experienced it a great deal myself. While I am not expert nor have much proof, I believe the problem is due to the way ssh was programmed. A very similar tool, mosh, does most things that ssh does while eliminating lag and adding other features. However, you will most likely have to install this on both your pc and server for it to work. I hope this will help you. \n", "Q: Where are crash logs after a system freeze? When your entire macOS freezes up and restarts, are there crash logs or core dumps to diagnose the problem? I would in particular like to know which kernel module was active at the time of the crash.\nSymptoms: The display \"froze\", the mouse cursor stopped moving, and the Force Touch trackpad stopped doing clicks. After maybe 10-20 seconds, the system restarted on its own. When it came back up I expected to see a Crash Reporter dialog, which usually has some useful details on the crash, but there was none. I also looked through logs in the Console and couldn't find anything, though maybe I missed something. Is there some place where I should expect to find crash logs?\n\nA: Apple moves the logs from version to version, but I would start with sysdiagnose.\nOpen the terminal app and type sysdiagnose or press the keys to trigger the data collection process.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you get system diagnostic files from OS X?\nThe good thing about this is it collects both the traditional log file based logs, snapshots like recent crashes, panics, hangs as well as a recent sample stored in a potable log archive format of the system log database files (since 10.9 more and more logs are stored in the apple system logs database as opposed to flat files and panic logs).\nFrom there, you can open the file and search for the panics and crashes.\n", "Q: Strange Keychain Popups in Safari I just upgraded my Mac from El Capitan to Sierra, and now I'm getting some weird keychain popups in Safari.\nWhen I browse Safari, if I visit a site for which I have credentials stored, a dialog pops up asking me whether or not to allow Safari to use the keychain info for an entirely different URL than the one I'm currently visiting (the url is a development server of mine). Here's a screenshot of it happening on Stack Overflow:\n\nTranslation by @owlswipe: Safari wants to access confidential information stored in [website] in your keychain with buttons for Always Allow, Allow, and Deny.\nThen it gets weirder: when I click \"allow\", a second prompt appears, requesting an administrator's password and mentioning SteerMouse, a system settings extension for advanced mouse settings that I've installed.\n\nTranslation by @owlswipe: For security reasons, please enter an administrator's password to confirm the action. You can add \"SteerMouse Manager\" to the list of input helpers in System Preferences to stop displaying this password dialog. with a username and password field and buttons for Cancel and OK.\nI don't have any reason to think that SteerMouse is trying to do anything nefarious here, as it's a widely recommended, popular product. But all this seems a little weird.\nI know I can probably make it shut up by doing what the dialog says, but before I do so, can anyone explain what is going on here?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Keychain Access.app in your Applications > Utilities folder. \n\n*Highlight the login keychain on the left sidebar.\n\n*Select one of the sites you see the popup from the list of credentials and double-click to get the info panel.\n\n*On that panel select \"Access Control\".\n\n*Below \"Always allow access by these applications\" click on +, and navigate to Safari in your Applications folder. Save changes.\n\n*Close Keychain Access and restart Safari.\n(adapted from this answer. You may need to do steps 3-5 for each site for which that problem is occurring; I'm not certain.) \n\nA: Solution A\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, press the key 'option' and click on 'Library' under 'Go'.\n\n*In library folder, scroll down to 'keychain'.\n\n*Click on the arrow to the left of keychain to reveal what's under it.\n\n*Delete everything under keychain, but not the keychain folder itself.\n\n*(In my case, I had to delete 3-4 files and a folder).\n\n*Restart the mac.\n\n\nSolution B\nDrag the window to the side of your screen and ignore it just like everybody else did to me\n", "Q: Photos on iphone 7 deleted after update I got a new iphone 7 while on vacation and started taking photos on it right away. When I returned, I plugged my phone in the computer and registered with iTunes. Then my phone reverted to my last icloud update and all my photos taken on vacation were deleted. Is it possible to get these back? Thanks. \n\nA: That's odd -- maybe iTunes restored a backup when you plugged it in? The \"setup as new or restore from backup\" screen in iTunes when you first plug in an iPhone is confusing, so maybe you chose restore from backup?\nIf so, we should check to see if iTunes made an \"emergency\" backup before restoring the old backup. Open iTunes and select Preferences from the iTunes menu (Mac) or Edit menu (Windows).\nDo you see a backup listed in there from about the time that this happened, maybe with a date stamp in the name? If so, you could either try restoring that backup (a little heavy handed) or use a third party tool to go look in the contents of the backup.

After a replacement of the battery in a moment of low charge (like 5-7%) the laptop is abruptly shutting down. As far as I remember it should be like a \"sleep mode\" or something like that.\nAdditionally, in a process of normal shutting down that I do by myself with any percent of charge, I hear some clicking sounds from the HDD that means that the HDD was turned off incorrectly (in a moment when read head doesn't stop in a parking zone).\nFor the first try of repair I did reset of PRAM and SMC but it doesn't help. As a result, either PRAM or SMC didn't reset (how I can check it?) or there is something else. Any suggestions?\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for attention! So here is more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*I Have A1278 Mid-2012 model.\n\n*I've using macOS 10.12.2\n\n*After the command syslog | grep shutdown I've got the result in only one line\n\n\nNOTE:  Most system logs have moved to a new logging system.

To host SQL databases, I run a mariaDB server from the Terminal.  In order to start the MySQL server so that I can connect to the databases, I run the command: \nsudo mysql.server start\nI want the server to start on login, so normally I would just have this command execute on login, but it requires the sudo command.  What do I change and how do I change it so that I do not need the sudo part of the command and I can just start the server on login?\n\nA: The best way to do this is to create a launchd .plist, copy it to ~/Library/LaunchAgents and let the system handle it for you.\nSample .plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.user.startMySQL</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>mysql.server</string>\n          <string>start</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI prefer to use the file naming convention com.user.<name of function>.plist when naming them so I can easily identify what is loaded and what is not.\nNext, you need to load this .plist as root so it runs as root\n$ sudo launchctl load com.user.startMySQL.plist\nTo verify that it has loaded you can issue the command sudo launchctl list and the command mysql to initiate a connection to the MySQL service.\nPlease note that this is just a simple example - you may wish to create a script to check to see if mysqld is already running before launching it.\n", "Q: iOS Spotlight searches displays really old contacts as tophits I have had this problem a while, especially through the iOS 9 and iOS 10 versions. Every time I pull down for searching from the springboard and type in a name of my contacts, iOS somehow lists my oldest and most unused as \"top hits\". Eg. if I have two contacts with a similar name, and one I have called 100 times the last month, and the other I haven't called or texted in 5 years, it is only the inactive one that is listed as a Top Hit.

I have two external monitors, positioned horizontally on each side of my MacBook Pro. When I am working in the far left or far right screens, I find it a little annoying to have to move the cursor all the way across to get to the opposite side (usually requires multiple swipes on the touchpad). \nIs there some easier way to do this? I already have BetterTouchTool installed but did not see anything in there that would do this. I was thinking of some kind of key combo shortcut I could use that would jump the cursor to the next screen. \n\n\nA: Apple mouse and trackpad reaction is strongly affected by speed of movement. Put a mouse in one corner. now drag the mouse very slowly. Back to the corner. now drag faster. you'll see that for the same physical space the mouse moved, you got double/tripple the amount of pixels when you move faster. \nNow if you move fast enough, like flicking (or swift swipes on a trackpad) you should be able to cover the whole desktop space in a single movement. \nIf that's not working for you - open the control panel, and speed up the mouse/trackpad Tracking Speed a little. That should do the trick.\n\nA: For anyone who is looking for an alternative, I've developed Cursr not too long ago, it allows you to configure links between borders and customize where mouse should go when it reaches/crosses those borders.\nI've started it as side project but now I'm working on it full time, it's now stable for majority of the users, but any issues can be reported on Github, I try and solve them as soon as I can\nI've recently introduced paid tier but that's for advanced features, linking borders together is and will always be free. Also key shortcuts for controlling mouse is an upcoming free feature\n\nA: june 2022\n\n*\n\n*download hammerspoon\n\n*download this spoon MouseFollowsFocus\nadd the below lines to init.lua\nmouse_follows_focus = hs.loadSpoon(\"MouseFollowsFocus\")\nmouse_follows_focus:configure({})\nmouse_follows_focus:start()\n\nfeel free to see my example\n\n*\n\n*PROFIT!\n\nA: This is definitely possible by using BetterTouchTool.\nSince you already have it, there is no need to install new software. Also, it has a lot of other options, so I prefer it.\nAnyways, here is how you do it:\n\n*\n\n*Go to BetterTouchTool Preferences > Keyboard.\n\n\n*Click Add New Shortcut or Key Sequence button.\n\n\n*Assign a new \"Keyboard Shortcut\" from Click to record shortcut, for example:for Monitor-1 Ctrl+Shift+1, for Monitor-2 Ctrl+Shift+2 etc.\n\n\n*Then from Trigger Predefined Action dropdown menu, selectOther Mouse Actions > Move Mouse To Position\n\n\n*A modal window will appear to capture your desired mouse position. Simply take your cursor to the desired position of a monitor and press Space to capture the position. Now Save the position in the modal window.\n\n\n*Repeat steps 2-5 for all your monitors.\nNow you'll be able to jump your mouse cursor to Monitor-1 by pressing Ctrl+Shift+1, to Monitor-2 by pressing Ctrl+Shift+2 and to Monitor-3 by pressing Ctrl+Shift+3.\nAll the best.\n\nA: None of the applications mentioned here worked for me: BetterTouch - not supported; CatchMouse - security warnings; mousebeam - not in App store.\nI found this free app in the App store that was really handy - ScreenJump.\nMy fingers will last a few more years :)\n\nA: The simplest, easiest and free method is to use CatchMouse.

I figure I could use this StartTech adapter to connect the Apple Thunderbolt Display to the Display Port of the card:\nhttps://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/945120-REG/startech_dp2mdpmf6in_displayport_adapter_6.html\nHowever, I've found many websites that claim this doesn't work, and one lone comment on the link above under Q/A that said it does.\nTo be clear, I understand that I wouldn’t be able to send a Thunderbolt signal to the Apple Thunderbolt Display using any of the outputs from the NVIDIA display adapter.\nI figured I could simply adapt the larger format DisplayPort to the Mini-DisplayPort and get it to connect that way. That is assuming that the regular DisplayPort and Mini-DisplayPort are essentially the same connection/protocol with just a different interface size.\nIs what I'm trying to do possible and if so, will this adapter work, or do I need to buy something different?\n\nA: In short, you can't.\nThis is because the Thunderbolt Display is a bit of a misnomer.  It's actually a Thunderbolt Dock with a display attached to it.\nThe requirements for the TB Display, per Apple are as follows:\n\nIf your Mac has Thunderbolt ports, you can use a Thunderbolt display\n  in macOS or Boot Camp. System requirements to use your Thunderbolt\n  display in macOS: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*A Thunderbolt-capable Mac\n  \n*The latest software and firmware updates for your Mac \n  \n*OS X v10.6.8 Snow Leopard or later\n  \n  \n  System requirements to use your Thunderbolt display in Boot Camp: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*A Thunderbolt-capable Mac \n  \n*The latest software and firmware updates for your Mac \n  \n*OS X Lion: Boot Camp 4.0 is included with Lion OS X v10.6.8\n  \n*Snow Leopard: Boot Camp that’s updated to version 3.3\n  \n  \n  (Emphasis mine)\n\nIf you look at the ports of the TB Display, you will notice there are\nno \"display\" type ports (DP, mDP, DVI, HDMI, etc).  Just TB, USB,\nFireWire and Network.  The Display adapter is actually \"embedded\" in\nthe display itself.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why you cannot connect an Apple Thunderbolt Display to a PC\n\nI figured I could simply adapt the larger format DisplayPort to the\n  Mini-DisplayPort and get it to connect that way. That is assuming that\n  the regular DisplayPort and Mini-DisplayPort are essentially the same\n  connection/protocol with just a different interface size.\n\nThis is correct.  However, what you are missing that that the Thunderbolt Display doesn't accept DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort signaling.  Your source has to be Thunderbolt to begin with.\n\nA: buy a graphic card for a PC that supports Thunderbolt3\n", "Q: Executing cd in a bash function called by subshell causes extraneous output Consider the bash function:\nfunc() {\n  cd /;\n  echo test;\n}\n\nCalling it does what you'd expect:\n~:>func\ntest\n/:>\n\nBut when called from a subshell (eg using backticks or $()) it performs very strangely.\n~:>func() { cd /; echo test; }\n~:>echo $(func)\ntest Saving session... ...saving history...truncating history files... ...completed.\n~:>\n\nThis issue does not appear if cd is not executed in the function:\n~:>func() { echo test; }\n~:>echo $(func)\ntest\n~:>\n\nThis is causing issues with some scripts that rely on certain output behavior, eg CLASSPATH=$(func) where func is complex and requires the use of cd.\nWhat's strange is that this worked fine before. It did not start to happen until recently, but I don't know what would have caused it.\nNote: alias cd reports \"alias: cd: not found\" and which cd returns /usr/bin/cd which is a script that is identical to another Mac which does not have the problem.\n\nA: There seems to be something odd going on as cd is not defined to behave as you are seeing it. Evidence suggests it's definition is being over-ridden somewhere.\nIt is possible that your cd command is aliased somewhere.  The alias command with no arguments will display a list of aliased commands on most shells. A workaround for an aliased command is to preface the command with a backslash (\\cd). That quotes the first letter of the command and defeats any alias processing by the shell.\nIt is also possible that it is a shell function.  declare -f should list the defined functions, at least in bash, and you can see if cd is being defined as a function.\nWith luck, your which command may support short-cut ways to do these checks.   Check out this on-line man page for how one implementation of which can be used to check functions and aliases, then see if your which operates in a similar manner.  \n", "Q: MBP Late 2016 Thunderbolt 3 issue: connected cables not recognized after sleep/wake up I have a new MacBook pro, late 2016 with Touch Bar, and recently bought some adapters (Aukey) to use my usb mouse, ethernet cable etc.\nOne thing that really bugs me is that the ethernet connection is lost whenever the computer wakes up. I have to unplug and re-plug it in again, i.e. the ethernet device is \"unmounted\" and does not get automatically detected again.\nI didn't verify this behavior with my other equipment yet, but I guess this could be a general thing? \nAnyway – is this a common error? Is there a cure?\n\nA: I've had a similar issue with the Monoprice Select Series USB-C to 3x USB-A 3.0, Gigabit Ethernet & USB-C Adapter. If I use the MacBook Pro 2016 w/ touchbar in clamshell mode with this adapter, the MBP will not wake from sleep at all. It's almost as if the adapter has gone to sleep, even though the lights on the ethernet port light up and blink and the AC adapter is plugged into the usb-c port on the adapter.\nI have another ethernet adapter made by Anker that has 3 USB-A 3.0 ports on it that works just fine though.

In other words I want to monitor what is being shown without having to look at the other screen (it is not facing me).\nSurely presenters want to know what the audience is seeing?\n\nA: Using various software with a secondary display, you can enter \"presenter mode\" and this allows you to see the current and next slide, with notes that only the presenter can view.\nThis is available in Microsoft Powerpoint and Apple Keynotes. With Powerpoint, you can enter 'presenter mode' using Option-Return [⌥↩︎]:\n\nWith Keynote, you can customise presenter notes and enter presenter mode using the menu option: Play > Customise Presenter Notes.\nI can't test as its the weekend but if I was at work, I could connect to a display and verify that it enters (as I believe) presenter mode automatically\n\n\nA: Usually presenters will be mirroring what's on their Primary screen to the external screen. That is, what they see on their primary screen is exactly what the audience sees. \nThis is called video mirroring and you can set it up using these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your second monitor and switch it on\n\n*Go to System Preferences (under the Apple  menu) \n\n*Click on Displays\n\n*Click the Arrangement tab.\n\n*Tick Mirror Displays from the lower-left corner\n\n\nIf, in your case, you have a particular need to view something different on your Primary screen at the same time the audience is viewing the secondary screen, but you also want a preview of what's on the second screen displayed in a window on your Primary screen, then this is not possible within macOS itself.\nHowever, I do believe I have seen specialised software used in churches, universities, etc that can do this. The specifics escape me at the moment, but if that's what you're after I may be able to find out.\n", "Q: How do I stop my Mac from syncing my whole library to my iPhone?

In games like this, it is very server-heavy, so they may be able to restore your progress from your profile that they have saved somewhere.\n", "Q: What is the maximum WiFi speed of iPhone 6s? I have a new broadband plan of 1000 Mbps been effective for a few days. With a new ac router claiming a max to 1300 Mbps, I have conducted a brief test with my SE. It was at 267 Mbps, far lower than I expect. I am going to test it with an iPhone 6s which may benefit with MIMO. What is the top WiFi speed that iPhone 6s supported? \n\nA: All iPhone 6s models support 802.11a/b/g/n and ac Wi‑Fi with multiple input multiple output (MIMO).\nThe iPhone SE also supports 802.11a/b/g/n and ac Wi‑Fi (but without MIMO).\nWhile you should get better speeds with the iPhone 6s, the reality is that there are many factors that can impact speed at any given point of time.\nHowever, if my reading of your question is correct, I think it's based on a misunderstanding of what the ac router claiming a max speed of 1300 Mbps actually means. This 1.3Gbps (1300Mbps) figure can be highly misleading because it is a theoretical maximum. It translates to 166 megabytes per second (MBps) or about 1331 megabits per second (Mbps), which of course sounds fantastic, but these figures are never realised in real world scenarios.\nMost 802.11ac routers will perform closer to a range of 250-300Mbit. \nIn terms of your devices, you'll find that the speed obtained by 802.11ac capable devices will differ considerably depending on how many antennas they can physically fit in. While the maximum supported by the 802.11ac standard is 8 antennas, most smartphones only have 1 antenna, most tablets will have between 2-4 antennas, and so on. Even 802.11ac routers will differ in terms of how many antennas they will incorporate. \n\nA: If you are using a device that is 802.11n you will max out at about 450mbps as you will be on the 2.4ghz wifi signal, 5ghz wifi signal which will use 802.11ac will max out at 1.3gbps depending on your service.\n\nA: We just had AT&T come install their 1000 Mbps fiber internet today.\nThey provided an Arris BGW210-700 gateway (router).\nI was curious to first test just the speed of the wifi connection between the router and my iPhone 6S (i.e. ignore the speed of the WAN/fiber).\nI used the Wi-Fi SweetSpots app and saw speeds from 429 to 478 Mbps.\nThis was slightly better than shown in this article that links to this video.\nI currently have no devices that can plug directly into the gateway, so I can't test whether AT&T is actually supporting the full 1000 Mbps download and upload speeds (but clearly my iPhone would be the bottleneck on the speeds anyway)†.\nWhen I tested my phone's internet connection through the router (using http://www.speedtest.net/mobile), I saw download and upload speeds ranging from 322 to 456 Mbps.\n† The Arris BGW210-700 gateway itself has a speed test and claims that it is achieving 974 Mbps download and 938 Mbps upload.\n", "Q: Tethering blocked with message about contacting provider Sometimes when I want to use tethering I get a message that I need to ask my provider.

I was looking into my users' Library/Mail folder at some emails and was wondering why they are organised the way they are. In ~/Library/Mail/V3/Mailboxes/Friends.mbox/5EF13EFE-AB95-43A9-93BB-E01CAE8DA511/Data/ there are a number of directories numbered 0 to 9. In each of these I have a number of further numbered directories, e.g. in folder 0 there are 3, 4 and 5. Each of these has a Message folder, which in turn has the individual emails.\nIs there are reason why these are not all in the same directory under the Friends.mbox directory?

Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database, or transmitted on the same channel, without needing to resolve conflicts between identifiers.\nIn its canonical string representation, the sixteen octets of a UUID are represented as 32 lowercase hexadecimal (base 16) digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens).

Photos.app automatically recognizes faces in photos and groups them by person. Are photos sent to Apple for processing or is everything done locally on the machine?\n\nA: Facial recognition and other image analysis is done on device. Never done on Apple's servers. Also the results of facial recognition and other images analysis are never send to Apple. \n\nApple’s system is more focused on privacy than Facebook's or Google’s,\n  with stricter limits on how the data is collected and stored. Onstage,\n  Craig Federighi insisted that Apple’s new system only uses local data, which\n  means the company isn’t storing faceprints on company servers — a\n  crucial point for anyone worried about their faceprint being used for\n  more than just cataloging photos. Faceprints are still being created\n  and used, but it's all happening on your phone, where Apple and the\n  rest of the world can't access it. That’s different from Google and\n  Facebook, which store data on the cloud and get significant scale\n  benefits as a result.\n\nStarting with iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra 10.13 however, facial recognition data will be synced across iCloud Photo Library. \nInterview John Gruber with Craig Federighi on how this works:\n\nNo, we've been working on it. And it's actually something that's\n  harder to get right right, because when you go through the process of\n  classifying your photos, we offer up and we say \"Hey, is this John?\"\n  And y'know, \"Is this John?\" And you say \"Yes, yes.\"\nBut when you say yes to one face, we're actually saying \"Okay, well,\n  there are a thousand other photos we saw that we think are the same\n  person as this, so we're going to count those all as John — but all\n  you really told us is about that one photo. \nAnd so what we actually sync, and support, and so that we get this\n  right — we sync only the specific photos you told us about, and then\n  each… 'cos that's really the truth, y'know, that's what the user\n  really told us.\nAnd then we sync that information, and then each device, because\n  they're independently doing photo recognition are talking that, and\n  re-deriving the\n  — coming to the final result on all your machines to synchronize. So\n  synchronize is actually very little data, and it's all just the truth\n  data, and we won't hold back the right solution.\nBut getting that architecture completely right was a — took a little\n  longer than we would have liked, and so we're super excited to have it\n  done now.\n\n", "Q: Stop iCloud automatic download to harddrive How do I stop iCloud from downloading files to my hard drive? I opened up a folder and it immediately started downloading all contents\n\n\nA: No it is not possible to stop automatic downloads or delay it.\niCloud is not a backup system, it is a syncing system, so it downloads whatever data is stored there to each computer and device signed in with the same Apple ID. There is no way to selectively download. It is an all or nothing sync. Apple have shown no interest so far in 'online backup' as you describe it, don't rely on that changing anytime soon.\nWhen your storage on your device is almost full, the system will purge data that you do not use often. It will still be stored inside iCloud.\n\nA: This is the answer, you just push undownload after the download is finished.\nhttps://github.com/Obbut/iCloud-Control/releases\n\nA: This answer is incorrect.

Can I stop it? I enabled FileVault to encrypt my hard drive a few days ago. The encryption process is still not finished and the estimated time keeps changing. It's been anything between \"4 days\" and \"300 days\". The encryption process running in the background makes my MacBook Air (from mid-2011, OS X Yosemite) heat up very quickly. \nI'd quite like to stop the process, or at least know how much longer it will take. How do I do that? \nI'm also wondering if, in order to complete the process, I have to keep the computer turned on. Does the computer sleep mode pause the encryption?\nI made a back-up of my computer's hard drive before I started the encryption process.\n\nA: There is no way to stop the initial encryption process once it hat started. But the good news is that you don't need to have your computer running until the process has completed. You can sleep or reboot it anytime you like, the encryption will continue afterwards. \n\nA: On Macs with a T2 chip FileVault encryption can be enabled instantaneously. The disk is always encrypted and only a new key will be set inside the T2 chip. \nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208344\n", "Q: How to customize MacBooks' keyboard?

I had to swipe left to see the \"missing\" episodes. What made this tricky to discover is that the first page of episodes show up below the bottom of my screen, which requires a swipe up to see them. So, you have to know to swipe up and left.\n", "Q: Recover playlists from iTunes iOS device backup iPod associated with an install of iTunes on a Windows PC; the Windows PC died, and the iTunes library was lost.  Most of the library has been recovered to a new install of iTunes on a new Windows PC by following the directions in this answer, but the process removed all playlists from the iPod.\nI'm assuming the playlists were included in the backup made in the first step of those directions, but I can't find any tool for extracting them.  I can find plenty of programs that can copy playlists from an iPod (might have been useful at the beginning, but not now), and plenty of programs that can extract anything but a playlist from an iTunes device backup, but I have not been able to find a program that can recover playlists from an iTunes device backup.\nHow can I recover the playlists from an iTunes backup of an iOS device on Windows?\n\nA: I'm fairly sure that the playlists are considered data synced from iTunes, and therefore aren't included in a backup.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136\nI just took a look through a few backups just to make sure, and I didn't see the playlist data anywhere.\n", "Q: Cannot enter Time Machine on rescued drive from dead Time Capsule I am on Sierra (10.12.2) and my 2TB time capsule just died. I took out the drive and to my surprise was able to mount it via USB through a SATA docking station. I was thinking I could just continue (at least temporarily) to use it as my Time Machine drive, but I am having an impossible time getting Time Machine to recognise the drive. I always get an error saying \"Can't connect to a current Time Machine backup disk\"\n\nI can see the backups and can select the disk to be my time machine disk, but Time Machine does not recognise the backups. \n\nHowever, I can open the sparsebundle with diskimagemounter and browse the backups, so everything seems to be in order.\n\nBut I cannot figure out how to get Time Machine to recognise this drive and continue backing up where I left off. Any ideas?\n\nA: As noted in some comments, I would not rely completely on that disk since it was part of a failed system. \nHowever, since it seems like the time machine files are stored inside a disk image, it should be possible to use Disk Utility to restore that image to a new empty harddisk, as long as it is at least the same size (like 2 TB in your case). When that is done, I would expect the new disk to be recognizable for Time Machine as as a backup disk, and continue your backups from there.\nFirst, connect a new, blank hard disk. Open Disk Utility and make sure the new disk appears in the Disk Utility Window. Now drag the icon of the disk image from your old backup drive that contains the Time Machine partition (named 'mac' in your first screenshot) into the left sidebar of the Disk Utility Window. Then you are able to restore that disk image onto the new blank disk. The new disk will now contain the complete filesystem of the disk image and should be recognizable for Time Machine.\nBe aware though, if the file system is corrupted on your old disk, it would mean that continuing backing up on top of that file system would continue to be corrupted, and therefore you are at risk of having an unusable or incomplete backup, even after several incremental backups.\n", "Q: Is there an official list for iTunes / iOS version compatibility?

A recent example of that is this one: Facebook Doesn’t Listen To Everything You Say, But It Does Listen When You Do This\nSo I want to prevent anyone from doing that.\nFor camera, I think a very safe counter measure is to simply block the view of the camera (by a piece of tape, for example).  (Note, by the way, that even the FBI Diretor suggested you to do that.  See this article: FBI Director: Cover up your webcam)\nNow how about the microphone?  Perhaps one counter measure is to blocking the internal mic also by a tape.  But I am also thinking whether I should do the following instead?  Plug in a dummy plug into the headset/mic jack (the plug has four rings and does not really connect to a real headset/mic electrically).  Would this disable the internal mic by hardware?  I think this method may be better because I am not sure a paper tape can block the audio completely for the internal mic.  Do you agree with this assertion?\nAny suggestion?  Thanks!\nThe answer may be same or different for iPhones and computers (and other smartphones).  But let's assume for now my main concern for now is iPhone.\nNote: I have read this post but I still don't know the answer.  My question is what if the dummy plug has four rings but those rings are not electrically connected to a microphone.\n\nA: Is your iPhone jailbroken? If not, I am not aware of a single instance where an iPhone that is not jailbroken has been compromised in terms of its camera or microphone. \nThe article you link to is about a laptop webcam, and this is a known risk and there are many examples of people's laptops being compromised (especially Windows models).\nAssuming your iPhone is not jailbroken, then any apps that are designed to use your microphone need to request access to the microphone. If you do not give permission, then iOS does not allow them to use the microphone. You can also check these settings manually at any time by going to Settings > Privacy > Microphone.\nIn terms of what you're actually trying to do, this will not work without some sort of software modification. The reason is that the internal microphone is available unless you have attached a microphone (or headphones that also incorporate a microphone). If what you connect to the headphone socket does not contain a microphone, then the internal microphone is still available.\n", "Q: Unable to View Web Browsing History in Safari 10.0.2 on macOS Sierra Safari recently quit displaying my web browsing history. However, it appears to be storing at least part of my history. (See Photo 1 and Photo 2). \nSafari preferences specify keeping history for 365 days.\n\n\nWhat might I try to fix this?\n\nA: Yes, I have the same issue. It started when I upgraded to Sierra, I got Safari 10.0.3. Rather than reinstall all of macOS, I'm waiting to see if this is a bug in syncing between Sierra and iOS through iCloud. \nHere are details of my thinking. \nFrequently Visited in Favorites isn't showing anything either.\nI got a History.db of 61,6 MB in my ~/Library/Safari/ folder and I manage to see some iCloud macbook browsing history on my iPhone running iOS 10.3.1.\n\n\nA: So I was having other problems with Safari. Since Apple implemented System Integrity Protection with El Capitan, users cannot simply reinstall Safari. Rather, one must reinstall the entire OS.\nI chose a Time Machine backup that predated when problems began and reinstalled. The problems have ended. No more unexpected shutdowns of Safari and the history is being recorded.\n", "Q: Forgotten Icloud urername and password.

My wife's iPhone 5S doesn't have enough storage space for all of her music.  If we were to buy a USB drive that connects to her phone, could we put her music on that and then have the phone play it from there in a reasonably hassle-free way?  What would the process be?\n\nA: You can read a flash from an iOS device, but this capability is limited to some very fancy lightning-port enabled USB flash drives. \nFor most use cases, I would recommend using a cloud service like Google Drive if you're looking to listen to purchased music on an iPhone without using up storage space. Essentially, you can just drag your music purchased from anywhere into Google Drive, download the app onto your iPhone, sign into your account, and listen to your music (though you of course need an internet connection unless you download them to your phone). \nHowever, if you want to buy a special flash drive, you can purchase the Sandisk iXpand Flash Drive, which plugs directly into the lightning port and can play music while plugged into the iPhone, through the Sandisk iXpand app. Just connect it to a Mac/PC beforehand to load music onto it through the standard USB port.\n\ntl;dr: Buy this flash drive or use Google Drive.\n\nEdit: don't forget about streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, which don't take up storage space either.\n\nA: I don't use a USB drive but do this with a My Passport Wireless Pro drive. The iPhone connects to the My Passport through the Passport's Wi-Fi and the My Cloud app gives me access to all the music and audio books we own. The only issue I have is that I can't give the media player commands through Siri. Honestly if Siri doesn't start to learn the way Alexa does my next phone won't be an Apple.\nIf I didn't use the My Passport for other things it wouldn't be worth it, but at this point I still have a need for external storage.\n", "Q: free up space on iphone Hi I have couple of questions regarding space on my iphone 5s, IOS 10.2\nQ1) available space shown in my iphone (2,93 GB) is different than what shown in Itunes when I connect it to mac (3,5 GB).

No matter how many times I have deleted them, they keep showing up like once every 3 days.\n\nA: There are a few ways you can clear up space on iOS. First of all, there are apps on the iTunes Store that clear up junk on your disk. I used one of these and it opened up 4GB without deleting anything that I noticed. You can also delete browsing data by going into Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data. Scroll down to the bottom and click 'Remove all Website Data'. You can also just delete data.

I purchased a refurbished MacBook Pro (MPB) to replace a previous one of almost the same model.  (Lest anyone wonder why such a foolish thing, I bought the old one used for cheap and it had signs of being dropped.  The new one looks nicer and has a one-year warranty.)\nIn getting ready to migrate, I wanted to do one last backup.  It was then that I noticed Time Machine says the last backup was at the end of the previous year (two weeks ago).  I am fairly certain I had the drive connected several times during those two weeks, and even clicked \"Backup Now\" more than once.  There were no \"unable to back up\" notifications.\nWhen I looked at TM preferences, the \"Preparing to backup\" progress bar gets to the end (or almost—it's hard for my eyes to tell whether the \"last pixel\" is still not blue).  But it stays there until I order it to cancel.  (Five minutes/sixty minutes according to my level of patience)\nfsck_hfs found nothing wrong with the drive.\nI found at least one web page that said this happens sometimes and a supposedly simple fix is to trash the *-in-progress backup, reboot, and try again.  Not only did that not help, SIP prevents emptying the trash.\nAny explanation and/or solution?\nI would like to \"inherit\" the backup, but if it's corrupt, I would wipe the disk instead and start over.\n\nA: I would go with the general thrust of the suggestion of NoahL in comments (i.e. move the inProgress folder to the trash, disable SIP, empty the trash, reenable SIP, and then try backing up again).\nHowever, if you do not know how to disable/enable SIP, you can follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your MBP\n\n*Immediately hold down the commandR keys to boot into recovery\n\n*Click the Utilities menu and select Terminal\n\n*Type csrutil disable and press return\n\n*Close the Terminal app\n\n*Select Restart.... from the  menu\n\n\nOnce you've rebooted, empty the Trash (assuming you've already placed the inProgress folder in the Trash). Once emptied, shutdown your MBP and follow the above steps again, except that at Step 4 use csrutil enable instead of csrutil disable.\n", "Q: WARNING: The version of Tcl/Tk (8.5.9) in use may be unstable I'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and am trying to get Python's IDLE to work properly with Tcl/Tk.

After I installed the DMG for 8.5.18.0, the bash terminal and Python are not recognizing the Tcl/Tk upgrade (Note that it is recognizing Tcl/Tk (8.5.9) instead of 8.5.18.0. How can I get IDLE and the upgraded python install from homebrew to recognize the upgraded Tcl/Tk 8.5.18.0? In other words, how can I resolve the warning message?\n\nA: According to this Python Software Foundation page:\n\nThe Python for Mac OS X installers downloaded from this website dynamically link at runtime to Tcl/Tk macOS frameworks. The Tcl/Tk major version is determined when the installer is created and cannot be overridden. The Python 64-bit/32-bit Mac OS X installers for Python 3.6.x, 3.5.x, and 2.7.x dynamically link to Tcl/Tk 8.5 frameworks. 32-bit-only Python installers for Mac OS X dynamically link to Tcl/Tk 8.4 frameworks.\nIn either case, the dynamically linking occurs when tkinter (Python 3) or Tkinter (Python 2) is first imported (specifically, the internal _tkinter C extension module). By default, the macOS dynamic linker looks first in /Library/Frameworks for Tcl and Tk frameworks with the proper major version. This is the standard location for third-party or built from source frameworks, including the ActiveTcl releases. If frameworks of the proper major version are not found there, the dynamic linker looks for the same version in /System/Library/Frameworks, the location for Apple-supplied frameworks shipped with macOS. (Note, you should normally not modify or delete files in /System/Library.)\n\nSource: Look for the How Python Chooses Which Tk Library To Use subheading on https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/#activetcl-8-5-18-0\nBecause of this, I am 99.9% certain that now you have updated to Tcl/Tk 8.5.18.0, what you need to do is to re-install Python 2.7.13.\nThe reason I believe this will resolve your issue is that upon reading the info I quoted, it's clear the Tcl/Tk version used by Python is chosen during the installation process and cannot be changed without installing Python again.\n\nA: 2018 Update\nSystem provided python/tcl-tk will always show that error.\nYou COULD download an updated tcl-tk and an updated python install (need to reinstall python to bind to new tcl-tk - install tcl/tk first!).\nMy PREFERRED method is using Homebrew.\nuninstall development version of tcl-tk\nbrew uninstall tcl-tk --devel\n\ninstall tcl-tk\nbrew install tcl-tk\n\nuninstall python and python3 (tcl-tk binding happens when python is installed, so we need to re-install once we have tcl-tk installed)\nbrew uninstall python\nbrew uninstall python3\n\nreinstall python and python 3\nbrew install python\nbrew install python3\n\ntest\nbrew test python\nbrew test python3\n\ntest IDLE (\"idle\" points to system installed python/tcl-tk, we'll no longer use that but might as well leave it there to prevent any future issues)\nidle2\nidle3\n\n\nA: This solution from Stack Overflow resolved the issue:\nbrew tap homebrew/dupes\nbrew install tcl-tk\nbrew install python --with-tcl-tk\n\n", "Q: How to remotely install software on Mac by scripts? I am a windows guy new to Mac, I need to deploy software to lots of Mac. \nI do centrally install software by scripts on Windows platform, but I still have no clue how to do it on Mac after having done some research.\nCan someone tell me \n\n\n*\n\n*What are some key components I need for centrally pushing out the software on the Mac?\n\n*What language do I need to use for the scripts?\n\n*Is there a Mac image create/deploy service available, like WDS on windows?\n\nA: What you ask is basically the trade of being a Mac administrator and there are three major ways to get this done and one where you let everyone do the work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Train your end users to install things\n\n*Use Apple's legacy tools to manage installs (ARD and AppleScript)\n\n*Use ssh and tools like homebrew https://brew.sh and shell scripts to install software and entire applications. \n\n*Use a modern MDM - the popular open source choice is Munki and the popular vendor supported choice is JAMFpro (which is the new name for the Casper Suite/JSS for the upcoming version 10 release)\n\n\n\nYou probably have asked this question since you have ruled out options 1 and 2 - but they are realistic and scalable options for organizations in the 10 to 100 client range. Past 100, you're probably going to want some sort of Apple push / MDM / automation framework and using one that's already in service is better than making your own for almost all cases.\nAlso, be sure to evaluate your end user \"self-service\" options. Munki has the managed software installer and I'm using JAMF's name for their end user portal for app installs, scripts and management. Even once you have a push framework set up to script things, letting users fix things themselves is the winning move if you want to scale up your support without hiring help desk staff to do everything for your clients.\n\nA: There are a few apple device management softwares out there, but almost none of them (at least to my knowledge) is free. A very popular choice is JAMF Software.\nIt is quite sensible to consider scripts to remotely connect to devices and deploy softwares (hopefully those that require minimal user interactions). There are limitations however if you do not have full control over system configurations of the target devices; an end-user may disable remote login or uninstall your softwares etc.\nOverall, I think the answer to this question may well depend on the nature of the software(s) to be deployed, technologies you want to use etc.\n", "Q: Move iTunes data from C drive to D drive My Windows7 C-drive is full.

And though I'm not familiar with OpenBSD I also doubt that the linked example works without further mods with one exception: filtering by MAC addresses after enabling bridge packet tagging.\nIn OS X bridge packet tagging (i.e. ifconfig bridge1 rule pass in on en4 src 00:17:f2:f8:1a:3d tag APPLETV) isn't possible though.\npf in OS X is a layer-3 packet filter. It relies on IP-addresses and doesn't really work with interface names or MAC-addresses. So using an interface name in a rule (e.g. block on en4 all) is internally translated to block on <IP of en4> all and in your case block nothing because en4 has no IP-address.\nEven after assigning an IP to en4 you wouldn't be able to block AppleTV traffic to the outside world because these IP-packets neither contain <IP of en4> as source nor as destination address.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro late 2016 (Touchbar) / WD elements HDD not in Finder I have a Macbook Pro late 2016 with Touchbar etc. and a Western Digital Elements external HDD of 1 tb. \nWhen I plug in my HDD it wont show up in Finder.

As a result, the only place these photos are stored is in the app data of this somewhat obscure third party photo frame app.\nI am trying to retrieve the original photo files from the app data.

I work on a tool that can help you dig into the backup files, Decipher Backup Browser: https://deciphertools.com/decipher-backup-browser.html\nYou could either look through the app's data in all files view, or try the all photos gallery view in DBB.

Can free apps be distributed by redeemable codes? I have several concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's say a user within company B wants to install the app, using a redeemable code. How does he do that? Is it done by opening the App store, entering the code and the app will automatically become visible for that user (based on Apple ID)?\n\n*If yes, can users update the app through Appstore? \n\n*MDM can be problematic to set up, and I'm not sure why it's a better solution than redeemable codes (Apple deprecated codes for some reason). Also, I'm not aware of a free MDM (heard about Cisco's Meraki), not sure how free that thing really is.\nI'd be grateful if you could answer any of the questions above.\n\nA: From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202995 :\n\nFree apps are available as redeemable codes solely for custom B2B apps.\n\nThat means you can distribute Free Apps with codes but only if the developer assigned your VPP Apple ID for a custom version of the App (might be the same as the generally available free version, but you need to contact the developer and request they publish it to you).\n", "Q: Macbook Air Magsafe 1 charging port burning out repeatedly I have been consistently having problems with my Macbook Air Purchased in Dec 2012 (Model A1369)\nFollowing is the sequence of problems I have faced :\n\n\n*\n\n*Magsafe 1 charger pins burned out (2 years ago), thrown away charger\n\n*charging port pins burned out and replaced I/O board from ifixit.com (1 year ago)\n\n*Purchased 2 Magsafe 1 chargers (1 year ago) \n\n*Now both the new chargers\npins have burned out.\n\n\nI am faced with a decision to either buy another charger (for about 90$) or buy a new non apple laptop altogether (I have seen the magsafe connector heating issue on many people's laptops). Because this is really affecting my ability to use my laptop while being on the move. Everything else in my Macbook Air is working great and I am very happy with everything else. It is just this charging problem that is frustrating me. I have to wiggle the port and try different combinations to get the green light to come. Even if the green light comes on, charging may or may not start until the orange light comes on. \nQuestion : If I keep the burned out charging port as it is, and just replace the charger, will it also burn out the new charger ? Or do I have to again replace both the charger and the I/O board ? Is there something fundamentally wrong with the Magsafe 1 charger that it burns out the contacts ? Because a friend of mine has a newer Macbook pro and the same problem happened with him and the contacts are burned out but the laptop still charges (though the magsafe port gets really HOT)\nSo I am currently left with 3 burned chargers and 2 burned out I/O boards. Do I take the decision to replace the I/O board again and also buy new chargers. How do I avoid the connectors getting burned out again ? \n\nA: My theory is that is due to very high humidity.\nIt is 84% in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India right now!\nHumidity can form conductive film between the pins that lead to continuous eddy currents.\n\nSo how does that apply to your situation?\nMagsafe is a magnet (strong magnet). There is always a lot of microscopic particle attracted and magnetized. Normally that would not do anything, but with high humidity it dissolves the micro particles in the water droplets and allows them to flow between Positive and Negative pools of the plug, thus leading to burn marks.\nMake sure your Magsafe plug is dry, and only charge it in low humidity environment.  Use Compressed Air can and frequently blow dry the magsafe.\nAlso put can put your Mac in a fridge YES fridge (not freezer) and charge it there.\n\nA: Without knowing your exact model of MacBook Air and the models of chargers you've been using, it's a bit hard to give you a definitive answer.\nSince you purchased it in December 2012, most people (me included) would assume it's a Mid-2012 MacBook Air. Both the 11\" and 13\" models used a 45W MagSafe 2 Power Adapter (although the batteries differed in these models (35 watt hrs in the 11\" and 50 watt hrs in the 13\").\nHowever, since you refer to MagSafe 1 in your question, you really need to clarify the exact model of MacBook Air you have. Perhaps post a screenshot of the About This Mac screen (under the  menu).\nEither way, to be sure you're using a correctly specified charger for your MBA, you should refer to Find the right power adapter and cord for your Mac notebook.\nTo answer your two actual questions:\nDo I take the decision to replace the I/O board again and also buy new chargers? - This is really a personal decision you have to make. Asking the community this will only solicit a range of opinions. However, if you're using the correct chargers etc, then you shouldn't be burning out your pins. If everything you've replaced parts with were the correct specs, then something else is going on here for it to be an ongoing issue.\nHow do I avoid the connectors getting burned out again? - Once again, I refer you to Find the right power adapter and cord for your Mac notebook.\nFinally, it may be worth contacting iFixit to check what they may be able to do for you? If you had the right I/O board and only purchased it a year ago, that'd be something you could raise with them\nI'd also do the same for wherever you bought the chargers from (after all, they were only purchased a year ago and now they're both dead). Of course, if all items were purchased from iFixit you may want to consider what you do raise with them (i.e. just the chargers, one charger and the I/O board, etc). \n", "Q: Using AppleScript to launch specific tabs in System Preferences panes So I'm new to this and I might be overlooking something simple, but after failing to figure it out myself I attempted to follow the instructions from grgarside's solution to this question:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/250276/220050\nWhat I am trying to do is open 'System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation' (in Sierra, 10.12.2) using an AppleScript saved as an Application I've created via Automator. I've managed to open all of the other tabs within the 'Keyboard' pane (Keyboard, Text, Shortcuts, & Input Sources) using their anchors as part of an AppleScript but not 'Dictation', the 5th and final tab.\nThis is my current script, which opens 'System Preferences > Keyboard' but then halts with no error message. (I did note that it activates the Search field within the Keyboard pane though, which it does not do when scripted for the other 4 tabs)\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\nactivate\nset current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\nreveal anchor \"Dictation\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\nend tell\n\nAny advice?\n\nA: The following works for me under macOS Sierra:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click radio button \"Dictation\" of tab group 1 of window \"Keyboard\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: I wanted to do something like this for the Arrangement tab of the Display pane.  Unfortunately these names have a habit of changing from time to time, but for now under Big Sur, this works, exclusively using the System Preferences dictionary and no need for System Events:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\n    tell current pane to reveal anchor \"Dictation\"\nend tell\n\nIf you need a different tab (not all of them are totally intuitively named), you can run this to get a list of all the tabs in the pane you're interested in.  e.g. for the Display pane:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\"\n    anchors of current pane\nend tell\n\nIn the Result pane of the AppleScript Editor window, you'll see something like this:\n\n{anchor \"displaysDisplayTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\" of application \"System Preferences\", anchor \"displaysNightShiftTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\" of application \"System Preferences\", anchor \"displaysArrangementTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\" of application \"System Preferences\", anchor \"displaysColorTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\" of application \"System Preferences\", anchor \"displaysGeometryTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\" of application \"System Preferences\"}\n\nSo in my case, the anchor name for the Arrangement tab is displaysArrangementTab.\n", "Q: Kingston Predator showing up as \"External\" Drive in Disk Utility, Blocking Boot Camp Install I installed a 480GB Kingston Predator PCIe flash SSD in a 2009 Mac Pro. It worked great after installing macOS Sierra. Boots fast and is very snappy.\nWent to install Windows using Boot Camp and I couldn't get past the error:\n\nYou cannot partition an external disk, a RAID disk or an internal disk on which FileVault encryption is in progress. Restart your\n  computer using an internal disk that is not part of a RAID set or try\n  it again after FileVault has completed.\n\nFor some reason either Mac Pro or macOS Sierra sees the PCIe SSD as an external drive.\nIs there any way to make it appear as an internal drive or any way I can dual boot into Windows if I cannot get past this error in Boot Camp?\n\nA: I was able to add a second PCIe flash card and install Windows directly without the use of Boot Camp Assistant. I was also able to do the same by using Apple Disk Utility to create a free partition on the macOS drive for Windows and install it that way as well. However I opted for the second PCIe flash card to keep things simple and segregated.\nNow, when I boot and hold the Control key, I get \"Macintosh HD\" and \"EFI Boot\", the later of which is Windows.\n", "Q: I need to get the Messages app on OS X Lion (10.7) I would like to start by stating that I am new to this forum, and have never used it before. Patience is appreciated!\nAll greetings aside, I need help with my Mac Mini.\nI have an early 2007 Mac mini that I have running OS X Lion. (the latest version that it supports) I believe that this system is 64 bit, as per this post: is my mac 64 bit or 32 bit?\nThe point of this is, I need this Mac to run iMovie 11, as well as the Messages application. Now, I would prefer to stick with Lion, execpt, I truly wouldn't mind 'hacking' this system to run something like Yosemite or El Capitan, because I am thinking of doing this in the near future.\nFinally, one more thing. As per the guide I quoted above, I think this mini is 64 bit. The problem is, all of the \"run Yosemite\" or \"Run El Capitan\" on unsupported macs all make the use of SFOTT. (sixty four on thirty two)\nI have tried the Messages beta app, which apparently is no longer supported, (no suprise there!) and would truly appreciate fast responses to this thread.\nHere's a screenshot of the specs on my mini:\n\nThank you everyone!\n\nA: Your question seems to jump around quite a bit and because of that is a little confusing. Below are some answers that may help.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to confirm whether your Mac Mini is 64 bit, the answer is yes.\n\n*Your question title says I need to get the Messages app on OS X Lion (10.7) but your question details say you already have the Messages beta app installed. That is the only official version (albeit in beta) that was released for Mac OS X Lion. In other words you already have Messages installed, so I'm not sure what you're question title is about?\n\n*Your question also states I need this Mac to run iMovie 11. iMovie '11 was bundled with all new Macs sold on or after October 20, 2010 or for separate purchase in iLife '11. So, if you want it installed on your Mac Mini, you would have had to have purchased and installed it (as part of iLife '11). It was also available for purchase on the Mac App Store. The good news is that in terms of compatibility, iMovie '11 works perfectly in Mac OS X Lion (10.7).\n\n\nIf what you want to know is something different, then please clarify your question.\n", "Q: How do I unbind a Mac from the AD using the command line?

The external drive did not show in finder. I tried booting into Single User mode and ran all the fsck commands with no success.\nThe drive was detected but when it is plugged in fsck starts to execute and it seems to run indefinitely. In my case it looped around the Could not repair after 3 attempts\" error but then it just restarted the tests again.\nI was not able to kill the fsck process either, it just kept going.\nFinally I downloaded the free version of DiskDrill and clicked on the Rebuild button. When doing that, Diskdrill showed me drive content. However I could not select mount in the Free version and could not pay 89$ for recovering a non-important drive worth 30$.\nHowever, I found it interesting that DiskDrill could see content and offered me to mount the drive so I wondered if it had done something good. So I went back to Disk Utility that previously did not allow me to Mount the broken drive and tried to Mount again and now it worked. I think DiskDrill unblocked something. \nAfter mounting, I was able to format the drive successfully.\nI tried all other options I could find, using command line, disk utility etc and this was the only thing that unblocked the situation. So it seems tools like Disk Drill etc can accomplish more than what Mac OS offers and it might be worth looking into if you have this issue. In my case I managed to work around it with the free version in combination with DiskUtility but if you need to recover files you probably need the full version (I could see the drive content but since I did not care about it, I just formatted the drive).\n\nA: I had a mac-system Volume not showing up in Disk-Util any more. (so my mac didn´t start any more)\nSomehow i managed to install OSX on a new Hard-Drive and plugged the old one external.\nLinux was still able to mount my Volume. But couldn´t read my Pictures and Documents Folder, because of readonly Disk and no rights to read these Folders. So couldn´t change the rights to readable by anyone.\nSo i couldn´t copy my Data to an other Disk ! (i didn´t want to pay DiskWarrior)\nThen my only Solution was:\n(first i created the Folder: /my/hfs with mkdir, and instead disk1s2 you should use your disk and volume numbers)\nsudo /System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/hfs.util -M disk1s2 /my/hfs removable readonly suid dev\n\n\nA: I'd recommend checking if fsck is holding your disk hostage upon connection. This was it for me.\nRunning ps aux | grep fsck revealed:\nroot              2587   7.3  0.1  4363584  21780   ??  U    10:56PM   2:22.54 /System/Library/Filesystems/exfat.fs/Contents/Resources/./fsck_exfat -y /dev/rdisk2s1\nSo the solution was a sudo kill -9 2587 (insert your PID instead of 2587) (or sudo pkill -f fsck).\nAs soon as that ran, my Volume immediately mounted.\nOh the irony of fsck being the problem...\nAddendum (surfacing from comments):\nIdeally, you're better off letting fsck run its course. Otherwise, you'll run into this the next time too.\n\nA: I have solved this issue by moving everything in the hard drive to another computer. Formatting the hard drive and moving everything back. \nIf you're having the same problem Ariel's solution sounds reasonable. Let me know if that works out so I can accept it as the solution.\n\nA: I've tried just about everything on every forum I read short of formatting my hard drive. I was able to save my data by plugging my hard drive into an older Macbook  not using High Sierra. After the beachball went away after a while I was able to see and  drag my folders to another external hard drive one by one. It took a few days because it was a 3T, but I was able to copy everything. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Solution:\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal\n\n*Install TestDisk brew install testdisk\n\n*Run TestDisk as a super user sudo testdisk\n\n*Run the scan, then select the \"boot\" menu to restore the NTFS boot sector\n\n\nA: Although macOS Sierra should allow you to read NTFS drives natively, have you tried installing MacFuse? This always works for me.\nYou can get the latest version from GitHub. (Just download the .dmg and install)\nThis free utility will allow you to mount, read and write to NTFS disks.\n\nA: Your drive is not mounting because the file system is corrupted and it is not seeing it as a valid file system.\n\nMost likely, your drive has or is in the process of failing.  My suggestion is to use a tool like DiskDrill's free tools to see if there is anything recoverable.  If it is and it makes sense to, then you can purchase a license to recover your data.\n\nA: Disk file system corrupted, indeed. If the disk is dying or not good anymore is easy to see with a tool. Download DriveDx from binaryfruit.com (trial) and the recommended satsmart driver. Test the disk.\n\nA: If your disk happens to be exFat and you unmounted wrongly, it's most likely that fsck process keeps it hostage for repairing.\nYou can run this command which will kill the process and unmount/mount the drive.\nsudo pkill -f fsck\n\nA: I had the same problem and I used this solution that I found here:\nhttps://support.wdc.com/knowledgebase/answer.aspx?ID=20789#highsierra\nJust a word of caution - this solution involves erasing the drive, so please read the entire article before you take any action with your hard drive!\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root?

How can I go about changing the time that a banner notification stays on the screen before disappearing?\nI did some research and tried the suggestion found here, but am having no success on my MacBook Air. I restarted and logged in/out of my account a few times after re-entering the command with no luck. Does this command no longer work?\n\nA: You cannot easily customize the time anymore on current os since the preference has been removed since MacOS 10.10 Yosemite.\nIf you want your notifications to stay on the screen until you dismiss them, you can do the following:\nGo to\nSystem Preferences > Notifications\nSelect the notifications you want not to be dismissed automatically. Change the \"alert style\" to \"Alerts\" instead of \"Banners\".\n\nA: I don't believe @oa-'s answer is correct.\nI am running Catalina (10.15.2) and was able to get a slightly modified method to what is mentioned in the link from OP working just fine.\nFirst, you need to specify -int before the number of seconds parameter:\ndefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime -int 2\n\nOtherwise, it's written as a string which won't be recognized as valid argument for the number seconds.\nBefore it'll take effect, you'll also need to restart the NotificationCenter process by signing out/in or running:\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\n", "Q: Headphone audio with Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable I'm thinking of buying a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable so I can connect my MacBook Air to my PC monitor for watching iTunes movies.\nHowever, the monitor has no audio capabilities so I wondered if anyone could tell me if I would still be able to listen to the audio via the headphone jack on the MacBook?\n\nA: Yes you can, by going into the system preferences -> Sound.\nThen select the tab: Output and select your output there.\nAs a shortcut you can ALT-click the volume icon in your top bar to quickly switch between outputs.\n", "Q: Pause notications in OSX whilst in a meeting I use the in built reminders application in OSX 10.10.5 which pops up notifications to my screen, this is also true for mail and iMessages.\nThis is great most of the time, but when giving a one to one presentation on my laptop or mirroring my screen to an external display via an mini display port to HDMI cable or via an apple TV, this has the danger of flashing up personal information to the screen. \nIs there a \"meeting mode\" i can enable to temporarily pause notifications popping up to the screen. I still want to reminders, iMessages, mail etc to give me notifications but would like to be able to toggle / pause them without having to go through system prefs. \n\nA: When you click on the notification icon in the top bar, you can select \"Do not disturb\" there by clicking the icon and scrolling up, the setting is hidden above the first notification. You'll see that the icon is greyed out to show the change in state.\nAs a shortcut you can click on the notification icon in the top bar whilst keeping ⌥ ALT pressed to go into \"Do not disturb mode\". \nNotifications won't show up now!\n\nA: You can easily activate Do Not Disturb on a Mac to silence notifications temporarily. Just hit the Notification Center icon  (the rightmost in the menubar), scroll up to the top, and activate the Do Not Disturb toggle.\n\nYou can also schedule Do Not Disturb sessions in System Preferences -> Notifications.\nEdit: As @beer's answer mentions, you can click on the notification center icon while holding down Option to quickly toggle DND.\n\nA: To add to previous answers, if you are mirroring onto a projector or screen, it is possible to disable notifications by going to System Preferences -> Notifications -> Do Not Disturb -> When mirroring to TVs and Projectors and checking the box beside it.\n\nA: If you use Airparrot to manage the mirroring, rather than the inbuilt airplay utility there are options to have notifications flash up locally to your screen but not be mirrored.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the mirroring option icon when I don't have an apple TV (but continue seeing other mirroring options when available)?

Run Airfoil on your Mac and the Airfoil Speakers app on your Android device.\nAlternatively, there may be free solutions. The protocol used by Apple devices to send audio to e.g. AppleTV and Airport Express devices is called Airplay and has been reverse-engineered by projects such as Shairport. There may be an Android app which emulates this protocol to make your phone into an Airplay destination.

Accept the free apps like iMovie and Garageband there. \n\nA: If you logged in to a new Mac with an existing Apple ID go to the App Store as Non Plus Ultra already answered. You should accept the free apps that came with the new Mac and link the license to your Apple ID.\nIn the new App Store you should go to your account, which can be found at the bottom of the menu on the left in the App Store.

I have a Mac Pro with a Kingston Predator PCIe SSD card, and a GeForce GT 120 card. I can install Windows 8.1 on the SSD after creating a dedicated partition without Boot Camp, but when I try to install the Boot Camp software and when it gets to the NVIDIA display driver step, the machine reboots. I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing the old driver and installing the NVIDIA driver from the Boot Camp NVIDIA folder.\n\n*Downloading the official NVIDIA driver from the GeForce.com website.\n\n\nIn both cases, the same problem occurs.\nSo I removed the SSD and put a regular SATA driver in Bay 1 and reinstalled macOS and ran through the Boot Camp process. After Windows 8.1 installed successfully, it started the Boot Camp setup where it completed with no issues and Windows 8.1 is working flawlessly.\nI tried both the SSD and HDD setups at least twice each and each time I got identical results:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install Windows 8.1 on the PCIe SSD and Boot Camp drivers, machine reboots on NVIDIA driver setup.\n\n*If you install Windows 8.1 on the standard HDD and Boot Camp drivers, NVIDIA driver setup works fine and Boot Camp finishes completely.\n\n\nIt seems that either the presence of the PCIe Flash SSD card only in Windows (works great in macOS) or the NVIDIA drivers (I tried several) has an issue installing on Windows 8.1 installed on a PCIe Flash SSD.\nAny one why I might be running into this problem and how I can get around it?\nSince posting this question, I tried using WinClone to migrate the working Windows 8.1 with Boot Camp drivers from the same machine into an empty FAT formatted partition on the SSD. The migration looked like it work perfectly, however when I boot into Boot Camp (Windows) I get a message from Windows that installation needs to be repaired. Obviously doing this would wipe out the NVIDIA driver and the machine will probably boot fine, and then when I try to install the NVIDIA driver again, I'll be back right back at the beginning.\nSince the last update, I called Kingston support and the rep claims there should be no conflicts between the video card (and/or driver) and the PCIe flash card. They are PnP devices, and the PCIe flash driver requires no drivers. He is baffled as to why this happening.\n\nA: As it turns out, once I replaced the GT 120 video card with the GTX 980, I was able to install Boot Camp software with no problems whatsoever.

I thought I was on to something with \ndscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'\n\nBut it doesn't look like Full Name is represented in that return data.\n\nA: Simply use id -P $(stat -f%Su /dev/console) | awk -F '[:]' '{print $8}'\nid -P $(stat -f%Su /dev/console) yields: \nadminuser:********:501:20::0:0:AdminUser:/Users/adminuser:/bin/bash\n\nawk -F '[:]' '{print $8}' yields the 8th term (the \"RealName\") of an output separated by colons.\nAs proposed by fd0 you can alternatively use:\nid -P $(stat -f%Su /dev/console) | cut -d : -f 8\n\nwhich is even more simple/elegant.\n\nA: You can use dscl to read the RealName:\n$ dscl . -read /Users/grgarside RealName\nRealName:\n George Garside\n\nThe following will give you just what you're after. This uses ‘who am i’ to get the username, then sed to format the output.\n$ dscl . -read \"/Users/$(who am i | awk '{print $1}')\" RealName | sed -n 's/^ //g;2p'\nGeorge Garside\n\n\nA: Needed a two-line approach:\nusername=\"$(stat -f%Su /dev/console)\"\nrealname=\"$(dscl . -read /Users/$username RealName | cut -d: -f2 | sed -e 's/^[ \\t]*//' | grep -v \"^$\")\"\n\nAnd then you can just echo out the realname variable.\n", "Q: How to reconnect VPN by using Tunnelblick from command line? The use case is that I need a particular VPN connected at all times on one of my servers which runs macOS. It's set up with Tunnelblick. And I know how to re-connect to it manually using Tunnelblick GUI. But I noticed that sometimes due to network sometimes disconnecting due to instability or some such, Tunnelblick could get into a state of repeatedly trying to reconnect to the previously connected VPN but would never succeed. Therefore, I'm hoping I can create a cron job to periodically check if the VPN is connected (probably by pinging an URL only accessible via the said VPN), and if not, reconnect to it by restarting Tunnelblick and reconnect to the VPN. What should the command line be? I intend to add the command line into my crontab.\n\nA: You should have a look at this Answer (comments are interesting too):\nHow to start Tunnelblick VPN connection via Terminal\nThis will guide you to create an AppleScript and then you may launch it by command line or crontab.\n", "Q: Call using Facetime audio only I would like to be using Facetime for audio calls only. When I open some contact on my iPhone I can see something like on the picture attached. The intuition tells me those two buttons within Facetime row should call using either video call or audio-only call. However it doesnt matter what button I click, it always starts the video call.\nHow can I start the audio-only call from contact card, like the one below? Many thanks\n\n\nA: Are you sure you're hitting the 'audio' button correctly? I found that it needs to be tapped very precisely.\nSometimes iOS incorrectly assumes that the tap goes to the whole FaceTime row, which is then highlighted in gray during the tap and starts a FaceTime video call.\n\nA: Like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open FaceTime app\n\n*Press the + located in the top-right of screen\n\n*Select the contact(s) you want to audio FaceTime call\n\n*An audio option will be visible (big green button)\n\n\nNote: These instructions are from here. \n", "Q: Change ssh connection info for Remote Login I've been setting up an array of Mac Minis running Sierra, and I'm trying to be consistent about naming them.\nHowever, for some reason, some of their ssh name@hostnames are different.\nFor example, the Computer Name and account names are all consistent, eg: Mini Kiosk 02 \"mini-kiosk-02\".\nBut their ssh info is sometimes different.\nSome are \"ssh mini-kiosk-02@mini-kiosk-02\" while others are \"ssh mini-kiosk-04@mac-mini\".\nI'm not seeing how I can change, eg, the part after the @ sign.\nI thought scutil --set HostName etc might do the trick, but that doesn't seem to change anything.\nUpdate\nAs you can see from the screenshot, hostname does not seem to correspond to what is after the @ in the Remote Connection settings.\n\n\nA: Your command should work:\nsudo scutil --set HostName YourHostName\n\nSince OSX 10.9 Maverick, it's possible to change it with hostname command. Without -s it will be a temporary change, adding the -s will set it up permanently:\nsudo hostname -s YourHostName\n\nTo verify it, you may type hostname and observe the return. \nUpdate\nOSX uses different variables to name the machine. You may need to reset them as well.\nscutil --set HostName YourHostName\nscutil --set ComputerName $(hostname -s)\nscutil --set LocalHostName $(hostname -s)\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server NetBIOSName -string $(hostname -s)\n\n\nA: Did you see that you can also set the hostname via the hostname command?  \nSo on a server try \nsudo hostname kiosk-99\n\nand then \nhostname \n\nHowever, if your final intention is to access the computer from another machine as\nssh user@kiosk-99 \n\nthis will be (as the other poster suggested) a DNS issue, because the other computer (where you type the ssh command) will need to translate kiosk-99 into that machine's IP address, i.e. it's the same as trying to \nping kiosk-99 \n\nand getting the right IP back from the name server.\nReasons then could be that you have multiple DHCP servers in the network, so when a kiosk asks the network for an IP address it gets some from different computers.  \nHave you checked if the IP addresses of the different miniMacs are similar?\n\nA: This looks like a DNS issue.\nBe careful to check the DNS settings on one machine at a time. Focus on the machine with the terminal doing the initial ssh. Let's call that testmac\nCompare the ssh user@host with ssh user@IP.address to see how the DNS server is giving you information on the testmac.\nOnce you're sure the DNS on one machine is working, then you can know if you need to change your DHCP server to update DNS when the Mac in question (the target of ssh - not testmac) received a DHCP lease. Or you could hard code things in DNS and make DHCP reservations to match what you have set up in DNS.\nTrying to scutil or hostname your way out of DNS issues usually is ineffective at best. The Mac .local names are for mDNS so you could ssh to host.local to avoid needing to mess with DNS. Depending on how many Macs are being run or if you have viable control over DHCP/DNS that might be a fair option for some situations.\n", "Q: Samsung SSD Firmware Update Power Cycle on MBP I am trying to install the firmware update for my Samsung 840 Series (250GB) on my MacBook Pro 13\" (early 2011). As explained in Samsung's installation guide I downloaded the respective .iso file and created a bootable DVD. \nJust before I wanted to reboot from the DVD I read in the installation guide that for some systems the firmware update utility will ask you to power cycle the drive meaning that you have to disconnect the SSD from the SATA and power cable for a short moment.\nSo I guess, the only way to install this firmware update is by removing the SSD and putting it into some SSD enclosure which will be connected to my MBP, right? Is there really no way to update while still having the SSD inside my MBP?\n\nA: The back cover of the MacBook Pro does not need to be on in order to operate.  You can even have the drive brackets removed.  Simply use a piece of non-conductive tape (I've used blue painters tape) to temporarily hold the drive in place.  I've also found that this works best at the edge of a desk or table with a towel or large mousepad for the MBP to rest on when I have it inverted.\nIf you are required to power cycle the drive, carefully turn over your MBP ensuring you don't close the lid,  pull the drive up, disconnect and reconnect the drive's SATA connector.  This will power the cycle the SSD.  \nOnce that's done, you can turn the MBP back over and continue the process.\n", "Q: iMessage often fails to send SMS on non-iOS device Since iOS 10.1, my iPhone often fails to send SMS. After sending, it waits, then display the red (!), saying \"not delivered\"\n\n\n*\n\n*it seems to only happen on non-iPhone recipients\n\n*most of time (everytime??), my recipient still get my message (in spite of the not delivered warning)\n\n*someone told me \"why do you always send your messages twice?\".\n\n\nHow this correct this issue?\n\nA: This could be down to people previously using an iPhone and having their number registered with iMessage, and then moving to a non-iOS device. In this case, your phone is still trying to send the message over the iMessage platform even though the recipient can't receive it. They can check and de-register here.\n\nA: I think you have this problem, because you are using the same email on two or more devices. Anyway I will provide you with two methods, because i had a similar problem like yours back in the day.\n\n\n*\n\n*Method 1: (not an universal fix)\n\n\nGo to Settings > Notifications > Messages, turn off notification center\nThen Go to Settings > Messages, turn off iMessage\nReboot the phone\nTurn iMessage notifications back on, then turn iMessage back on, in that order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Method 2: (if you are using the same iCloud account on two or more devices)\n\n\nGo to: iMessages > Settings > Send & Receive > turn on all your phone numbers and email.\nMost importantly, set \"Start new conversations from\" your phone number, not from your email addresses.\nGood luck.\nEDIT: If you update to the latest iOS version this problem will be fixed by  itself.\n\nA: Update to iOS 10.2 if you haven't done that. Then disable and enable iMessage, see if the problem persists.\n", "Q: diskutil moving partitions into order for merging I just had my first attempt with diskutil mergePartitions - it was on a backup disk and I ended up loosing all partitions in between :p\nHaving learnt from my mistake that mergePartitions merges from the first partition to ALL IN BETWEEN up to the last - how can i move partitions so that they are in sequence.\nSo for example, say I have:\nmergeThis   disk0s1\nleaveAlone  disk0s2\nleaveAlone  disk0s3\nwithThis    disk0s4\n\nI want to merge disk0s1 with disk0s4, so how do I get to the following stage, before I can run the merge command\nmergeThis   disk0s1\nwithThis    disk0s2\nleaveAlone  disk0s3\nleaveAlone  disk0s4\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Though you can't move the partitions, you will be able to merge both partitions. You have to convert disk0s1 to a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group, then add disk0s4 as a second CS Physical Volume to the existing CS LVG and expand the Logical Volume in the existing CS LVG to the expanded CS LVG. CS is available in older OS X versions but adding PV to existing LVG is only working reliably in OS X 10.9 and newer.\nmergeThis   disk0s1\nleaveAlone  disk0s2\nleaveAlone  disk0s3\nwithThis    disk0s4\n\nmergeThis   disk0s1 > LVG' > PV1 (disk0s1) > LVF' > LV' (disk1)\nleaveAlone  disk0s2\nleaveAlone  disk0s3\nwithThis    disk0s4\n\nmergeThis   disk0s1 > LVG > PV1 (disk0s1) > LVF' > LV' (disk1)\nleaveAlone  disk0s2\nleaveAlone  disk0s3\nwithThis    disk0s4 > LVG > PV2 (disk0s4)\n\nmergeThis   disk0s1 > LVG > PV1 (disk0s1) > LVF > LV (disk1)\nleaveAlone  disk0s2\nleaveAlone  disk0s3\nwithThis    disk0s4 > LVG > PV2 (disk0s4) > LVF > LV (disk1)\n\nThe content of disk0s4 will be erased. The content of disk0s1 will be preserved as disk1 and disk1 has finally the ~size of disk0s1 + disk0s4.\n\nCoreStorage is a logical volume manager, which is an additional layer between device/partition and a volume.\nA Logical Volume Group is based on one or several Physical Volumes (which can be one or several physical devices/partitions) and may contain one or several Logical Volume Families/Logical Volumes.\nIn OS X it's usually used to manage FileVault and Fusion Drives,\n\nA: Unfortunately what you are trying to accomplish is not actually possible. Live partitioning a drive works to create a partition, but not to move one. \nIf you think of it like a piece of paper that you've drawn 3 horizontal lines on in random places - effectively creating 4 non-equal spaces - you can erase a line in between two of the adjacent ones and have one larger space again. What you're trying to do is cut along the two outer lines surrounding one of the spaces, and then try to move it into a space that 1) is already occupied by another space and 2) is highly unlikely to be the exact same size therefore would not fit correctly. Throw in the fact that the main partition is in one format (Mac OS Extended Journaled) and the other partitions likely are not, and it gets even messier.\nI apologize if that was hard to follow, but it's the only way I know how to explain it without getting into the mechanics of what really happens when you hit the 'Erase' button in a Disk Utility tool.\n", "Q: What to do (besides rebooting) when Finder won't navigate to /tmp?

When I go into email, there aren't any unread emails, let alone 2730. I have no idea how to find them to remove the alert saying I have unread email. Can you help?\n\nA: Your question does not specify what you've already tried (if anything)? \nThere can be a number of causes for this problem, and many possible solutions. For now I'll offer a couple of easier solutions since I don't know what you've already tried.\nSolution 1 - Just remove Mail notifications altogether\nIf all you want to do is remove the alert, then follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your iPhone Settings\n\n*Tap on Notifications\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Mail app listed\n\n*Tap on Mail\n\n*Disable the Allow Notifications toggle\n\n*Exit Settings\n\n\nNow the incorrect tally of unread emails is gone.\nIf you want to keep the notification, but just want it 'fixed', then there are a lot of possible solutions. I offer one of the more common ones below:\nSolution 2 - Temporarily switch off your email account(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your iPhone Settings\n\n*Swipe up until you see Mail\n\n*Tap on Mail\n\n*Tap on Accounts\n\n*Select the mail account that shows the unread messages\n\n*Toggle the Account off\n\n*Fully switch off your iPhone by holding down the power button for about 5 seconds and swiping the slide to power off prompt\n\n*Wait for at least 30 seconds\n\n*Switch your iPhone back on\n\n*Follow Steps 1 to 5 again and then skip to Step 11 below\n\n*Toggle the Account on again\n\n\nNow check whether your Unread Email count is correct?\nNOTE\nIf solution 1 is not what you want to do, and Solution 2 does not resolve your issue, there are many other possible solutions. Please update your question to include what else (if anything) you've already tried.

The only way to get it (sort of) working was by holding the power button down and forcing a reboot. \nAfter a few days of investigation, I found that if I have the Thunderbolt to Ethernet dongle plugged into the computer (even if there's no ethernet cable connected!), it will boot up and function perfectly normally. \nI've tried to reset both the SMC and NVRAM, as well as plugging in a MiniDP -> DP adapter, and a USB3.0 Ethernet adapter into my computer and booting up. None of these steps have worked.\nI've also reinstalled the system (trying Sierra, Mountain Lion, and El Capitan) and none of these resolved the problem.   \nCan someone please tell me what to do next? I'm a bit desperate. Thank you so much!\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience. This means trying things one by one until you get to the bottom of the problem.\nThe next two things I would try are running an Apple Diagnostics Test and also booting into Safe Mode. See below.\n1. Run Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Disconnect the Thunderbolt > Ethernet dongle\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. If that still doesn't work, connect the Thunderbolt > Ethernet dongle and try following the above steps again (but skip Step 2).\nRegardless, take a note of what happens.\n2. Boot into Safe Mode\nFollow the steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Disconnect the Thunderbolt > Ethernet dongle\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. could you boot your MBP or not)\n\n*To exitSafe Mode just restart your Mac as normal\n\n\nOnce you've run the diagnostics and tested a boot into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.\n", "Q: MBP boot stuck at 100% loading screen For a day now i can't boot my Mac El Capitan.

If that happens to you, try the solution found here:  Black Screen But Can See My Cursor\n\nA: The similar situation was on my Mac mini 2014: Mac OS (of any version, of any kind, including booting from installation flash drive or loading within the Internet recovery process) was showing the progress bar for a long time when loading, the progress bar moved slowly, reaches the end and nothing more happened.\nAfter PRAM reset (Command+Option+P+R) Mac OS has been successfully loaded, but only for one time. For every next Mac OS load it was required to perform PRAM reset again. In addition, the loading took longer than usual.\nIn Single User Mode (Command+S) there was a message \"pci pause: SDXC\" when executing some commands, and then all stops.\nAnd one more symptom: a delay of a few seconds between click on power key on the case and startup chime sound.\nEverything was fixed by replacing the PRAM battery (this is a regular CR2032 battery). The loading speed was also regained back to normal.\n", "Q: Duplicate birthdays in Calendar but only on Mac I have my birthdays stored in my contacts.

I changed login.sh to...\n#!/bin/bash\nlongname=$0\nshortname=$(basename \"${longname}\")\necho \"$(date -u \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\") ${shortname} (${longname}) running...\"\noutput=$(/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background)    # <- COMMAND GOES HERE            \necho \"$(date -u \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\") ${shortname} ended.\"\n\n...and that works (my usual static desktop changes to my default screensaver). I use this idiom for other launchd tasks, running the tasks in a subshell so I can easily test whether the operation succeeded and log $output. I don't understand why this works while your original doesn't, but at least it does work.\nNote that I removed the & from the end of your command - I'm not convinced this is necessary with launchd, and it was preventing my wrapper script from logging that it had ended (though the & wasn't the cause of the original problem).\n", "Q: iPad Safari missing bookmarks, favourites and reading list My iPad Safari bookmarks, favourites & reading list have disappeared. It won't let me bookmark or favourite any sites either. I've tried a hard restart, switching off iCloud & deleting cookies but to no avail. Is there a way to solve this? \n\nA: Check your Restrictions.\nIf that doesn't work, back up your iPad and use iBackupBot to delete the Safari folder in app data.\nafter you delete Safari folder, Reset All Content And Settings(wipe)then activate and restore your iPad.\nor just type safari in settings and clear history and website data, \nafter that, you can sync you data from iCloud.\n", "Q: Search file system for a similar image Can anybody recommend a macOS application to search for images similar to a single candidate?\nI can find plenty of duplicate finders which search folders for duplicate or nearly duplicate images, but I can’t find one which searches a folder for images matching a particular one.\n\nA: There is a product called Deep that allows you to search by color pallette.\n\nDeep calculates the range of colors used in each of your images by analyzing the pixels and calculating the most popular colors. This is what makes the palettes in Deep powerful, you can find images that have similar colors, which is great when you are looking for the perfect picture to go on your web site. In fact, just drag any image on to Deep and it will find and rank all the images on your computer that are similar.\n\nThere is even a YouTube video demoing its usage so you can get an idea of how it works prior to downloading, installing, and purchasing.\n", "Q: Disable the sleep function of the macbook touch bar I got the new Macbook Pro and i found out that the touch bar goes to sleep after 75 seconds of inactivity. This function is quite annoying to me.\nIs it possible to disable the sleep function of the touch bar for the 75 seconds of inactivity? I have googled it, but i didn't find anything. \n\nA: You can use my script until Apple adds a preference for the Touch Bar.\nIt simulates keyboard activity by sending the command for the fn-key every 60 seconds. You should not notice it while typing. Keep in mind, however, that this will prevent display sleep / system sleep as well.\nCopy and paste the following code into the \"Script Editor\" application on your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar:\n(*\n1. Save as an Application: Script Editor > File > Export… > File Format: Application\n2. Check \"Stay open after run handler\"\n3.

I found no complete one, but here's a partial one that might alleviate the worst part of the pain. I find that the single most annoying thing about the disappearing Touch Bar is its effect on the esc key. I use that all the time! Now you have to tap the bar twice: once to wake it up, and then again to press esc. (Or alternatively, press the fn key to wake up the bar, then press esc.)\nHere is a way to at least rescue esc functionality by adding it to what remains of the physical keyboard. You can remap the caps lock key to be your esc key. You'll lose caps lock functionality, which is also a drawback, but maybe not as bad as losing esc. (Alternatively, you can remap the control, option, or command key instead.) Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys, and use the drop downs to choose the action you want.\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-use-esc-key-touch-bar-macbook-pro\n\nA: I found @oa-'s answer useful.

To remove the script from the Cmd+Tab switcher, find the applescript application and edit its Info.plist file (right click the app file -> Show Package Contents, open Info.plist with text editor). You should add \n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>1</string>\n\nto it so it becomes hidden from app switcher.

On the 2016 MacBook Pro with touch bar, most Apple applications allow you to customize the touch bar. It's also possible to change the control strip in the System Preferences.\nHowever, I can't find a way to change the touch screen buttons that are displayed on the lock screen. I would like to add the backward/forward media buttons besides the play button.\nDoes anybody know how (or: whether) this is possible?\n\nA: There is no way to customize it yet.

Do we have any other option to make to new iOS support in our current version of Xcode without upgrading the version?\n\n\nA: Xcode updates through the Mac App Store are delta updates, meaning they only download the files necessary, rather than the entire bundle every time. This should reduce the download size.\n", "Q: How to set No Access (restrict) permission to a user on a folder? I'm trying to deny my user access to a certain folder. I can't.\nI set an admin account to be the owner of that folder, but i can't set \"No Access\" for any user on that folder. But i can do it for \"everyone\".\nWhat i really want to do is cut myself off from a certain folder (the old xcode apps) without having to delete them and empty trash, i want to keep them, but make sure my user can't access any files in that location anyway, unless i override it again.\nSo these are two questions, but i expect my first question to be answered. Maybe there is a way i can do that through command line, which i'm still not sure, but is there a way using the OSx interfaces?\nThank you\n\nA: You could set the folder to have the following permissions to deny access from yourself, do this with your admin user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Everyone: No Access\n\n*admin user: Read & Write\n\n\nAfter this delete the line with your own user, so that you fall under the group \"Everyone\". This way only the admin user has an exception to the \"no access\" rule.\n\nA: Though anyone can access the folder with the POSIX permissions 777 you still can restrict access for a single or several users (or group(s)) by adding ACLs. ACLs are an additional more fine-grained layer of permissions for files and folders.\nThis is done in Terminal.app by entering\nchmod +a \"user/group add/deny permission\"\n\nSo if you have a folder with the following permissions:\nls -laed /Users/Shared/OldXcode-projects\ndrwxrwxrwx 2 adminuser  wheel  68 Jan 17 14:32 /Users/Shared/OldXcode-projects\n\nyou can add the following ACL:\nchmod +a \"user1 deny list,add_file,delete,add_subdirectory\" /Users/Shared/OldXcode-projects\nls -laed /Users/Shared/OldXcode-projects\ndrwxrwxrwx+ 2 adminuser  wheel  - 68 17 Jan 14:32 /Users/Shared/OldXcode-projects\n 0: user:user1 deny list,add_file,delete,add_subdirectory\n\nThough everyone (e.g. adminuser, user2 and user3) has full access, user1 can't access the folder nor add files or folders.\n\nA: Just put a dot first in the folder name.

Where can I disable it?\n\nA: On your iPhone, go to: \nSettings > Messages and flip the \"iMessage\" switch to off. \nYou will still be able to send and receive regular SMSs, charged by your carrier or included in your monthly plan, but not iMessages. And they will stop trying to activate by sending those SMSs to a number abroad. \nSee http://osxdaily.com/2014/04/15/disable-imessage-ios/ if you want some screenshots. \nIf this fails then there's an hick-up with your phone or SIM. In that case, try resetting the \"Network settings\" (you'll lose all saved WiFi credentials): \nSettings > General > Reset > Reset NETWORK SETTINGS and confirm. Be sure to really choose \"Network Settings\". \nAfter the device restarts you can still do a soft reboot, this usually clears most small issues: \n\n\n*\n\n*with the device turned on and unlocked press and hold the Power Button (top or side, in newer models) and the Home Button (front) together, i.e. at the same time \n\n*keep holding them for 10 seconds and until the device reboots and you see the white Apple logo on screen. You can then let go off the buttons. \n\n\nFinally, Apple also posts some troubleshooting, if you want to attempt again to re-enable iMessage in the future, and still come across the same problem: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201422\n", "Q: Does updating iOS force you to update watchOS?

You can use an Apple Watch with older versions of watchOS while using iOS 10 on your iPhone.\nYou won't be able to use any features that are exclusive to iOS 10 or higher watchOS versions, though. Think standalone watchOS apps (watchOS 2.x and higher), iMessage animations (watchOS 3.x and higher), new watch faces and so on.\n", "Q: Application Switcher slow draw/refresh I've done quite a bit of web searching and have not found anyone addressing this specific issue.\nAfter upgrading to Sierra (macOS 10.12.2) the Application Switcher (horizontal popup with app icons that pops up when you type command-tab) is noticeably slower.  \nOne of the reasons it is slower is the graphics draw times.\nWhen it initially displays it paints from top to bottom.  The painting is so slow it is easy to see its progress (maybe it takes .3-.5 seconds).  Then when you release the tab key it redraws again with lighter colors then disappears.\nAnother problem I have is that the Chrome (even the Canary version) Hangouts extension is completely unusable because draws/refreshes are slow or repeat too often.  Those redraws occur as a series of rectangular areas around the window.  Each rectangle draw is slow enough to be visible.  Another Chrome symptom is that the tabs for each open web site flash incessantly. This all happens with hardware acceleration disabled in Chrome settings.\nThe Hangouts bug is the important problem since it is the only way I know of to get Mac notifications for instant messages through Google.\nMy hardware is a late 2010 Mac Mini with an NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB graphics chip and a single monitor connected via a digital cable.\nAlso, I upgraded from an old version of macOS to Sierra, skipping at least two versions (Yosemite and El Capitan I guess).\nThe same 'slow draw' problem occurs in Safari when I open the attach file browser from Gmail.\n\nA: It turns out that, somehow, the graphics chip was no longer recognized by the OS when these problems started.  The flashing and flickering was apparently due to the slow processing of fade-in and fade-out animations when these animations were rendered by software instead of hardware.\nI know this because I downloaded Maxon Cinebench and it told me my graphics card was \"Apple Software Renderer.\"  When I rebooted the graphics card then showed as \"NVIDIA GeForce 320M OpenGL Engine.\"\nI don't know why the OS did not recognize the Nvidia graphics chip but I assume it will happen again which would give me a clue what caused it.\n", "Q: What is the current method to set a larger cache size for VLC player on a Mac? What is the current way to set the cache size to 10 or 20 seconds so that the video over network won't lag?\n\nDetails:\nI have an NAS, and use it as a file server. Sometimes when I stream some files through wireless (802.11ac), the video may lag.\nIf I copy the file over to my Mac's hard drive, it takes only about 5 minutes, and the video is more than 1 hour, so it really shouldn't lag, if VLC is smart enough.\nHow can I set VLC to use a larger cache (I see Settings -> Video -> Show All, but don't know if Stream Output: Muxer caching is the correct setting, because setting it to 9000, meaning 9 seconds, the video still would lag). The simpler setting Settings -> Input / Codecs -> Default Cache Level won't work no matter what I set it to).\nI think the cache can be even smarter if it first cache 1 or 2 seconds, and start playing the video, and meanwhile, just cache \"as much as possible\", such as 10 or 20 seconds. It will be better not to cache 10 or 20 seconds as a start, because that will mean a long delay to even start up the video.\n\nA: VLC Preferences → Show All → Input / Codecs → Advanced (scroll down) → File caching (ms) and Network caching (ms). File caching is used when using the standard Open File functionality, even if the file is located on the network. Network caching is for the Open Network function in VLC.\n\n", "Q: How to know if MacBook Pro with LG 5K Monitor Displaying at Correct Resolution I've got the new MacBook Pro with TouchBar and the new LG 5K monitor.  I plug it into the USB port directly (single usb-c port using provided cable).\nIt looks good but I can't tell if it is really showing 5K.  In About/Displays it shows 5K but when I look in the apple display app it looks like it has less resolution then the 4K monitor I have sitting next to it (when I unplug the 4K, the screen resolution does not change even after reboot which I think is to be expected).\nMy question is, How can I know that my 5K monitor is really working at 5K?  is there some kind of 5K test pattern I can look at?\nI called apple and they had no idea how to know.  Worst support call from apple ever.  guy said he had no manager, could not escalate.  Told me it's like buying a third party product from Walmart (even though I bought it from the apple store and it was in Tim Cook's keynote)\n\n\nA: Under the display tab in the screenshot you posted there should be a \"Resolution:\" option. Click on the \"Scaled\" option to the right of it and it should show several resolutions, with the one you are currently using highlighted. If the resolution you want is not listed trying hold option and clicking \"Scaled\" for more options.\nAlternatively, if you are comfortable with the command line, the follow command should list the resolutions used on all active monitors:\nsystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep Resolution\n\n", "Q: iPhone 5 not charged enough to boot after 2 hours plugged in Today I drained my iPhone 5's battery (went down to around 10%) and then went out in the cold (it is winter now and very cold, around 0ºC/32ºF).

Now, you can see just the rankings and the goals of the game; you can also invite and challenge your friends only through iMessage, and only if the game supports it.\n", "Q: Can Apple decline my iPhone warranty just because my phone has dent even without looking inside the phone? I went to power mac service center to get my phone which is still under warranty fixed. They were not able to restore my phone and told me that in the event that it is hardware damage the phone will be replaced but because my phone has a small dent at the corner and had small cracks on the screen it is not under warranty anymore that is why I have to pay a big amount.\nI'm puzzled because they didn't even check if the problem is caused by the dent or if it is manufacturing issues and now they are declining me of warranty.\n\nA: If your iPhone is still under warranty then Apple will not reject a warranty repair unless they can determine that any damage is the cause of the issue.\nOf course this will depend on how much damage there is to the phone, what the issue is, etc. Unfortunately your question doesn't specify what the actual issue is, and without a photo of your phone we don't really know what you mean by a small dent at the corner and small cracks on the screen.\nAlso, how do you know they didn't even check if the problem is caused by the dent or if it is manufacturing issues? In most cases there is no need to physically open the phone to determine if there is a fault.\nIf it was me I would be calling Apple directly and discussing it with them.\n", "Q: Garage Band takes 46 GB? I recently got a new MacBook Pro and it only has 120 GB on it. On the system information page, I saw that garage band takes a whooping 46 GB on my Mac! I don't know how this has happened!\nWhen I received this computer, I installed logic pro, and downloaded a ton of loops. Afterwards, I wanted to delete them for other stuff, so I deleted garageband and logic off my computer, and removed all files and audio loops from application support and elsewhere, however, it still shows that it takes 46 GB. How do I fix this?\n\n\nA: It's not actually garageband taking up that space, but since it shares internal system locations and data, the space used gets categorized as \"garageband\". The actual space usage is probably due to the audio sample storage, which doesn't have anything to do with the apps but is merely a directory in one of the Library directories (i.e. Your local user Library or the system Library.\n", "Q: pfctl config to allow VPN host names instead of IP addresses in OpenVPN connection I would like to use VPN domain names instead of IP addresses to only allow some VPN servers on my Mac.

I have been using Netflix (for example) on my phone with headphones, but then I realized I would have a better experience watching it on the TV, but keep the audio on the phone.\nIs there any way to project a video (only) onto the Apple TV, and keep the audio on my iPad/iPhone/Mac?\n... I'll contrast this with OS X, where I'm able to airplay and switch between headphones and TV speakers just by plugging in headphones.\nIn addition there is this Midi control panel where I can configure outputs:\n\n\nA: While you cannot AirPlay video and get audio through wired headphones, you can connect Bluetooth headphones to an Apple TV 4th Generation. Since you have wired headphones, you'll need to make them wireless, which you can do with a simple Bluetooth audio receiver like this $15 one. Then, you can pair that Bluetooth audio receiver to your Apple TV, plug your headphones into the Bluetooth receiver, and be good to go. \nI have no affiliation with the makers of the Bluetooth receiver, but I have tested it personally (playing music from iPhone to wired Beats wirelessly) and it works great. \n\n\nA: This cannot be done natively from an iOS device as there are no output settings built in to the iOS platform that allow the splitting of the audio from the video while streaming a file. With the use of extra hardware and/or 3rd party software though what you're trying to accomplish can technically be done in a round-about way, just not the exact way you're describing, where your headphones would be connected to your phone. \nThis link has some options (some fairly cheap) that you could explore though:\nUse Headphones with Apple TV.\nI did notice you mentioned owning a Mac though. One option not mentioned in that article (because it's not Apple TV related) would be to just use your Mac connected to your tv, using a long HDMI cable and a 'Mini display port to HDMI adapter' ($10 on Amazon). That way you could sit with your Mac beside you and your headphones plugged into it, although you would have that HDMI cable strung across the room while in use that you would have to be careful of.

In other words, does supervised mode compromise the security of the device or the user's privacy in any way?\n\nA: Simply being supervised grants the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remote wipe, which won't provide access to your information, only resetting the device.\n\n*Activation Lock bypass, allowing a reset device to be used again by the administrator.\n\n*Managed Lost Mode, providing the device's location (but you'll know about this through a large modal message).\n\n\nSupervision also allows the administrator to install a number of features on the device, including a web proxy, allowing internet traffic to be monitored. To tell if these features have been installed, go to Settings → General → Profiles & Device Management → profile name.\n\nA: Supervised mode allows the supervisor access to the entire phone, without the consent of the owner - since consent is implied by using a supervised phone. \nHowever, only the computer that originally supervised the phone has access to it, so nobody else can do an unlock or wipe on the iPhone. \n", "Q: macOS Sierra: mounting NFS volumes I have a Linux server with a number of NFS exports. I have been mounting them on my Mac by setting up an auto_nfs file, and mounting them in /nfs/… folders.\nI think this may the cause of some peculiar behaviour with some applications, which don’t seem to be able to fully traverse these volumes (see Applications Not Working Properly with Networked volumes for details on what I mean by peculiar).\nWhen I mount a SMB share, it appears as a separate volume under my computer, but not so with NFS.\nI conclude that things would work better for me if I mount the NFS shares in the /Volumes directory. But I can’t:\n\n\n*\n\n*The settings in auto_nfs require existing directories, and in Sierra, I can’t create one.\n\n*I cannot mount an NFS share using the nfs: protocol, since apparently this isn’t supported.\n\n\nApparently Sierra changed a few rules regarding the /Volumes directory.\nHow can I mount an NFS share as an ordinary volume? Mount NFS share in /Volumes as a drive, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*It’s an old one and not applicable to Sierra\n\n*The suggestions don’t work here\n\n\nA: The accepted answer only works when the NFS server allows connections on non-reserved ports (i.e. >1024).\nThe exports man pages say it:\n\nexportfs understands the following export options: secure\nThis option requires that requests originate on an Internet port less\n  than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). This option is on by default. To turn it\n  off, specify insecure.\n\nFor my CentOS 7.3 box this is not the case by default and I had to add insecure to the mount. \nSo for MACOS client to work you'll have to add the insecure option to your nfs server in your export\nE.g.: /my/export 192.168.5.0/24(insecure)\nIf that's not possible: using mountyou can supply an option to allow reserved ports from the Mac side:\nsudo mount -t nfs -o resvport server:/my/export nfs\n\nA: In Finder, press cmd + k and enter the path to the NFS server/share:\n\nFor me this mounted as /Volumes/users-1 (but I already had /Volumes/Users mounted).\niMac21:~ user$ df -h /Volumes/users-1\nFilesystem               Size   Used  Avail Capacity iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on\n192.168.7.5:/nas/users  5.4Ti  4.8Ti  292Gi    95%  261121 366027775    0%   /Volumes/users-1\niMac21:~ user$\n\nIf you wanted this to happen on boot you can add it into the login items for your user.\n", "Q: How to push only with iCloud photos I have a friend who owns a iPad and iPhone, and a Windows PC. We are using iCloud to sync pictures between the lot. \nWhat we would like is for all images / pictures taken on the iPad and iPhone to push a copy up to the iCloud photos. \nWhat we would also like is for the devices to not pull anything down. \nThe issue is, he has 10k pictures in his iCloud Photos and this is too many images on his handheld device.\nIs this possible? I went into the settings app and then ICloud but could only see options for sync.\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library only does a full sync. Your friend might want to consider switching to something like Google Photos where a full sync isn't forced.\n\nA: You can use My Photo Stream for that purpose:\n\nHow many photos can My Photo Stream store?\nYou can choose to download all of your photos from My Photo Stream to your Mac and PC automatically.\n\nWith iCloud for Windows installed and My Photo Stream activated, images taken or saved on the devices will be downloaded to your PC and will remain there past the 1000 pictures / 30 days threshold.\n\nIf you don't add images to the \"Upload\" folder, there won't be pushed to your devices.\nI think adding a backup routine from the Photo Stream folder might be a god idea.\n", "Q: How to disable Location Services using Siri?

I move it between the two laptops above, and everything was great.\nRecently, I've been having trouble.  The Mac puts up a notification \"USB Accessory Needs Power / Connect \"Apple USB Ethernet Adapter\" to a USB port on this Mac.\"  If I do that, it works, but mysteriously, if I plug an old, non-powered USB 2.0 hub into the USB 3.0 hub, and plug the ethernet device into that, that also works.\nEvery once in a while, the keyboard connected to the KVM stops working, too.\nWhat's wrong here?  Is the hub defective?  The ethernet device?  Why does the second hub help?  Since it happens to two laptops, it doesn't seem likely that it's a laptop or driver issue.\n\nA: I am pretty sure this is an issue with macOS Sierra. I had a similar problem with a brand new powered hub (Dyconn PowerHub SuperSpeed 12 Port (10 Data/Charging + 2 Charging Only Ports). I assumed it was a defective hub and replaced it. However, the problem persists with the new hub. I have searched around and there doesn't seem to be systemic issues with that hub, and there are lots of issues with macOS Sierra and USB power management.\nCurrently I have a powered hard drive and 2 printers connected to the hub, so I don't think anything is drawing power. The devices seem to work - I can print and access the drive, but about every 30-60 secs a \"USB Accessory Needs Power\" window opens and closes very quickly.\nI am running macOS Sierra 10.12.4 on a MacBook Pro 15 mid-2015. From what I have read elsewhere, macOS Sierra has issues with USB management.\n\nA: The most likely cause is a fault having developed in your powered hub, in particular because you have the same issue on separate Macs, one running Sierra and one running El Capitan. I've had this happen to me a few times. They only seem to last a couple of years if used all the time. I do admit though that getting it to work by connecting the second hub to the first makes no sense. I would replace your powered hub. You can always return it if it doesn't resolve the issue.\n", "Q: Unable to connect display(s) to MBP 13'' Mid 2014 via Tunderbolt / mini DisplayPort Okay, so I've spent almost the entire last day on this problem, and I've googled the crap out of it, I hope someone here can help me.\nFirst off: Yes, I've cleared the NVRAM/PRAM several times and I've reset the SMC more than once too.\nI have a setup with two displays on my desk that are connected to my desktop PC. I sometimes used one of those displays with my MBP via HDMI. A couple of days ago, I've decided to use both of those with my MBP and an external keyboard/mouse just to have a more tidy experience on my desk.\nSo I got two DisplayPort to HDMI cables to realise this extravagant folly.\nNow, when I plug either of them in, nothing happens. \nThe (internal) display will flicker for a second, but the external displays are not detected. Neither via the old \"hold option and click detect displays in Preferences->Displays\" nor via \"put Mac to sleep and wake it up\". I've cleared the NVRAM and reset the SMC several times. I've booted up in safe mode and tried it. No dice. They don't show up in the system information box either.\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to connect both displays at this time. Neither of them works with neither cable.\nThe cables are not faulty, as I've tried both cables and both monitors with my MacBook Air Mid 2011, and they work just fine in all possible combinations.\nBoth displays work just fine with the MBP directly via an HDMI cable or with my mini DisplayPort->VGA adapter. \nSo, surely, it must be some software issue. \nNow, I've tried to use one of those hellish cables to connect my MBP to my TV, and --voila-- it worked. So my MBP is indeed capable of using those cables. \nSo, I've ruled out\na) the cables\nb) the displays\nand c) the notebook as a source for my woes.\nNeither is it the combination of a & b (works with MB Air), a & c (works with TV), or b & c (works via HDMI and mDP->VGA).\nWhat am I missing?\nHere's the displays, sorry for not including them in the original post:\n\n\n*\n\n*BenQ XL2411\n\n*Samsung SyncMaster P2770\n\n\nThe TV that for some reason works with the cables and the MacBook is a Panasonic TX-32ASW504. I'll try and go around town and plug my Macbook into other people's HDMI to test out other displays.\nI'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 on a MacBook Pro Retina 13'' Mid 2014.\n\nA: So it looks like you have systematically ruled out all hardware issues on all components, so you're right and it sounds software related. And since you were using at least one of the monitors before, it's likely not a compatibility issue.\nJust in case, I would connect an external monitor (even though it appears unusable) and then check for software updates in the App Store - maybe there's a necessary firmware update to install that has yet to be triggered.\nWhat I would do next is to test the issue in a new user account - if it happens there, it's a system-wide issue. If it doesn't, the problem could be with a corrupt system preference file somewhere in your user library that needs to be regenerated. If you have a backup from before this issue occurred, restoring your user's home folder from the backup would actually be the quickest and easiest solution to this problem, as hunting down individual preference files can be tedious when you don't know the exact one causing the issue.\nIf it's a system-wide issue, it's likely OS related not system library .plist related as you still had the same issue in safe mode. (Although if the monitors are identical it could be a driver issue and I would check the manufacturer's website for new drivers, but if they're different and both are not working that is highly unlikely.)\nNext I would back up your system and then reinstall the OS from the App Store to see if that fixes it. I know that's time consuming but I usually set mine up before I go to bed and it's done long before I wake up.\nLast but not least is an Erase and Install from the Recovery Partition, but let's hope it doesn't come to that!\n", "Q: Finder window background colour or image for USB Drive I would like to know how to add an image (if that's not possible then a colour) to the Finder window of my USB stick - just the stick not every window.\nI have seen it on various .DMG installers (the ones which require the app to be moved into the applications folder often have an image with an arrow and a text telling the user to drag and drop) and now wonder how this is done for the window of a USB drive.\nI have an application which runs straight from the stick itself without wanting to move it to the apps directory of the Mac. Every time I click on the USB drive I would like to see a custom image background (much like on those DMGs).\nSearch results returned old and obsolete ways or partial answers no longer supported by macOS Sierra.\n\nA: Only works in icon view & as far as I'm aware only on HFS drives.\nI quickly tested with a FAT32 drive which appeared to work, but didn't survive eject/insert]\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your folder or entire disk & set view to Icon [ Cmd ⌘   1  ]\n\n*Show view options [right click or  Cmd ⌘   J  ]\n\n*Select Colour or Picture [for picture you then drag & drop an image to the box on the panel.\n\n\n\n", "Q: macOS apache installs on different directory with homebrew, how to start/stop?

But as i read (if i understand correctly) macOS comes with apache in /private/etc/apache2 wich when already running and i install brew it doesn't take the apachectl commands anymore... so im not able to stop it until i brew uninstall httpd24 and then sudo apachectl stop.\ni can reach localhost:80 ->system apache\nand localhost:8080 -> brew apache\nso how can i controll the system apache when i have brew version installed?\n\nA: TL:DR; Use /usr/sbin/apachectl\nThe issue is that you have bins for both versions, and as they have the same name. Your .bashrc / .bash_profile configuration will determine the order bin folder are included, which determines which wins.\nIt's generally a good idea to /usr/local/bin win, as this is stuff you installed yourself and not something that comes with the OS by default.\nThe location of the apachectl script for the apache installed on macOS is located in /usr/sbin, so you can run it directly using /usr/sbin/apachectl. Alternately you can make an alias or symlink for this to make a unique command.\n", "Q: Back button in Finder occasionally disabled; always go up one step in hierarchy? The back button in Finder seems to only remember your own trail. I.e., when there is a folder higher up the hierarchy, but you did not visit it before you came to the current one, the back button will be disabled.\nThis means that when I open a Finder folder in an existing directory, the back button will not work. I would like it to function more like it does in Windows, so that the back button will always go up one step in the folder hierarchy. Is this possible on macOS Sierra?\n\nA: The back button behave the same way in Windows & Mac, it returns to where you last looked. If that was the only place you've been, it has no history.\nYou can test that in Windows by either selecting different locations from the sidebar shortcuts, or by opening a new window by right clicking a folder & selecting Open in new Window.

I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 2013→2014) with a mini PCIe SSD (512GB, Solid State Drive).\nThere is a problem with my current operating system causing the video output to be corrupt. Native screen is blank. HDMI output is a bunch of crazy, snowy, flickering lines and such.\nAlthough I'm fairly confident the rest of the system is working underneath the façade (or lack thereof). Apparently, it's not a GPU / hardware problem as I first thought (According to the in-store Apple tech \"genius\" guy; I was reluctant at first to agree, but now convinced).\nI tried reinstalling the OS via safe mode recovery methods.

Currently on Yosemite (10.10.5).\nMostly for Metal, I am interested in now upgrading to El Capitan (10.11.x). I have no interest in moving to macOS Sierra at this time. Apparently Apple is not really a fan of what I'm trying to do and has made it very difficult for me to just upgrade to El Capitan.\nI do not have it listed in my \"Purchased\" tab of the app store. Further, the direct link to download El Capitan from Apple gives me a fun modal:\n\nThis version of OS X 10.11 cannot be installed on this computer.\n\nPresumably this is because it is for Snow Leopard upgrades.\nAnyway, any help on how to install El Capitan is appreciated. Googling has not been helpful.\n\nA: After more research and other similar questions on Stack Exchange, I have come to the solution I was originally looking for.\nThis website provides some instructions, but more importantly direct links to the .pkg files for El Capitan on the osxapps.itunes.apple.com domain. You can then use the checksums from this git repo to verify the installers if you still feel something is fishy.\nI also spent about an hour on webchat with Apple support trying to get El Cap added to my purchase history for my Apple ID, so I could just download it from the App Store, to no avail. Their official recommendation was to find it on a third party site. Couldn't believe it. They also noted that going into an Apple Store / Genius Bar may yield results with getting it installed (or any Apple Authorized store), at which point backup media could be created if it ever needed to be reinstalled.\n\nA: Apple removes the previous version of macOS from the Mac App Store whenever a new one comes out because it's in their best interest for customers to have the latest OS (for customer satisfaction, security, app developers, etc.). You do still have two options for updating to El Capitan if you don't want the latest Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a copy of the El Capitan installer from a friend who has it\n\n*Find it in your Purchased section of the Mac App Store if you downloaded it before, or start Family Sharing with a trusted friend/spouse who upgraded their Mac to El Capitan (from there you can see your friend's purchase history in the Mac App Store and download the El Capitan updater).\n\n\n\nNote: If you do start Family Sharing with a friend, make sure to stop sharing after you get the download you want or else your friends will be able to remotely wipe/lock your device and see your location at all times with Find My Friends or Find My iPhone.\n", "Q: How to keep MacBook Pro from stopping Time Machine when sleeping?

I have a Macbook and an iPhone who are both not syncing to iCloud, but the iCloud itself is filled with pictures that i want deleted. Is there any way of doing this without first having to delete thousands of pictures on one of them? \nI tried doing it on the iPhone but apparently it says you can cancel it for 30 days, meaning i still cannot use the iCloud library since they're still in my \"recently deleted\", meaning if i enable it on any device, it's still going to download those thousands of pictures. Is there a way to just hard delete everything?\n\nA: You can delete them on iCloud.com but deleting thousands will be painful. Photos can be permanently deleted immediately by deleting them from the \"Recently Deleted\" album.\nJust enable iCloud Photo Library on the Mac using the \"Optimized Size\" setting and placeholder/thumbnails for the photos will quickly appear. Delete them from the regular Photos view then delete them again from \"Recently Deleted\" and you should be good.\n", "Q: If I hold a letter, my keyboard stops working for that app I can reliably reproduce this in several programs. If I hold a letter such as a to type aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, it doesn't repeat, it just types it once. But then when I try to input text in the app after that it doesn't work. Keyboard shortcuts still work in the app, but input no longer works. In Chrome, input in the page fails but I can input in the address bar ok. \nWhat on earth could cause this and how do I fix it?\nThis is on a MacBook Pro 15 inch Mid 2015, OSX 10.12.2 (Sierra).\nHere's a screencast of it happening:\n\nNote how I type h a few times individually, then hit space and hold the h key. From that point on the keyboard completely fails to input any characters, though (as demonstrated) I can use the keyboard to copy/paste just fine. In Chrome, the keyboard is only broken in that tab (even through a refresh--the only way to get the keyboard back is to open a new tab). In text editors like PHPStorm, it's broken in all tabs and the entire app must be restarted to unbreak the keyboard.\n\nA: I cannot reproduce the issue on my end but it sounds like you may have an issue with an Accessibility feature, seeing as how it's happening in multiple applications. Have you tried toggling 'System \nPreferences > Accessibility > Keyboard > Sticky Keys' (or Slow Keys) on and off and trying to reproduce the issue?\nSecond option might just be that your keyboard settings were somehow changed from the preset delays that you're used to. You could check 'System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard' and check the delay sliders. Setting the first one to 'Fast' and the second one to 'Short' should actually allow you to press and hold a non-alpha-numeric key for multiple entries (such as the punctuation keys or keys like =, +, -, _, etc.) \nNote: The Mac keyboard does not allow you to press and hold letters because certain letters such as 'a' and 'e' trigger an accent menu to create characters such as 'à' or 'ē'.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and I was able to solve the issue by running in the terminal:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nThis effectively disables the accent menu (which never actually popped up for me). The problem would occur again if I re-enable the above setting.\n\nA: If I recall correctly, the issue here ended up being something related to an OS update gone wrong resulting in some deep-level corruptions.

I have also seen places where people have mentioned that localhost does work in the browser, so I am wondering what I am doing wrong here.\nFrom comments\nIf I try the IPv6 address for localhost http://[::1]:8080/ then I get the same errors as using localhost.\n\nA: First check name resolution with the system resolver:\ndscacheutil -q host -a name localhost\n\nIf you get an output like:\nname: localhost\nipv6_address: ::1\n\nname: localhost\nip_address: 127.0.0.1\n\nthe system resolver works correctly.\nStop your node.js app, create a simple node.js server by using this file with an arbitrary name (e.g. multiserver.js):\nvar http = require('http');\nfunction handler(req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n  res.end('Hello World\\n');\n};\nhttp.createServer(handler).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');\nhttp.createServer(handler).listen(3001, 'localhost');\nhttp.createServer(handler).listen(3002, '192.168.0.5');\nhttp.createServer(handler).listen(3003, 'host.example.com');\nhttp.createServer(handler).listen(3004, 'LocalHostName.local');\n\n(replace the IP of the :3002 server by an IP of your host (ifconfig), the host.example.com of the :3003 server by the output of echo $HOSTNAME and LocalHostName by the output of scutil --get LocalHostName)\nand start it with\nnode ../multiserver.js\n\nNow test your \"multiserver\" with Google Chrome by entering http://name:port (don't forget to prepend http://).\nThe first two ports should work with both \"names\" (127.0.0.1/localhost). So entering either http://127.0.0.1:3000, http://127.0.0.1:3001, http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3001 should all yield \"Hello World\".\nAlso check the nine permutations of the next three ports and names (e.g. http://LocalHostName.local:3002 or http://192.168.0.5:3004) which should also all yield \"Hello World\" if the hostname/DNS are set up correctly.\nIf all this works, your express/node.js app is faulty.\n\nA: Maybe try to use the port 80.\nYou said 127.0.0.1:8080 works so I am wondering if 127.0.0.1 works too.\nI think if you type in localhost it will resolve to localhost:80 where nothing is listening.\n\nA: I am not a Javascript programmer so if anyone has better links please edit.\nThe issue is that your server is listening on the IPv4 address only and it should be listening on the IPv6 address as well.\nHow you chnage your server is off topic for Ask Different as it requires code changes. This StackOverflow answer might help.\nApple has changed macOS from El Capitan onwards to look for IPv6 addresses in preference to the older ones as reported here\nYou can test the server directly at http://[::1]:8080\nIn the worse case you could remove localhosts alias to ::1 but better if you can't do anything then just use http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your testing\n", "Q: Siri: \"Play all songs shuffled\" in iOS 10 If I am currently playing a song (unshuffled) and use Siri to \"Play all songs shuffled\", Music continues playing the same song even though Siri is showing that \"Shuffle\" is considered on.

When I turn it on I get a load of notifications saying that I need to re-enter the password for my internet accounts.\nDigging a little deeper what has happened is the 2 factor auth passwords used for Mac Mail Gmail accounts have all been lost. Any ideas why this keeps happening overnight and what I can do to prevent it?\nI've tried going to System Preferences > Internet Accounts and updating the passwords used to a Google app specific password (the system Google uses to get around applications that don't support their 2 factor auth) but when I do this it insists that I use a 2 factor login.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I updated to Sierra and then Mail kept asking for password but did not help when I re-entered them. I dug deeper and found the ports needed to be corrected (in Mail Preferences). Did that and it works now.\n\nA: I was able to resolve the issue by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going into Keychain and deleting all of the Google auth tokens for all of my Google apps for business and Gmail accounts.\n\n*Delete one of the internet accounts completely\n(I don't think this step is essential but it's what I did)\n\n*Restart the machine\n\n*Re-add the account I deleted, re-populate the passwords for the accounts that were missing them. \nThis seems to solve the issue temporarily as I haven't had it reoccur for a few days, but after a month of working fine, the issue has come back.

She then does not get it until she turns on her data. \nThis only happens with my niece who has an old iPhone 4.  She is unable to upgrade to iOS 10, so maybe that has something to do with this issue? It was fine prior to me upgrading to iOS 10.2 (messages to her when she had data connection were sent as SMS so she used to actually get them when offline). When one of my friends—who has iOS 10.2—has no internet connection, messages to him are sent as SMS automatically so he actually gets them. How can I get messages to my daughter to send as SMS automatically when she's disconnected from the internet but not from calls and texts?\nI have enabled Send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable.\n\ntl;dr by owlswipe: Messages to my niece's iPhone when she's disconnected to the internet but connected to voice + text used to automatically send as SMS instead of iMessage, but they no longer do. How can I restore the old behavior?\n\nA: It sounds like the Messages app thinks that a device signed in with your niece's Apple ID is connected to Wifi or the internet, whether this be the case or not. Is there a chance that she's used her Apple ID to sign in to the Messages app on a Mac? If so it could be receiving her iMessages, thus circumventing the 'Send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable' because technically a device capable of receiving those iMessages is 'available'.\nIf that's not the problem, these steps have worked for me in the past so I'm hoping they'll also work for you! (You will likely need your Apple ID and password to sign back in to iMessage when you're finished.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable 'Send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable' \n\n*Turn off iMessage altogether on your phone from 'Settings > Messages' (the main/first slider)\n\n*Restart your phone\n\n*Turn iMessage back on from 'Settings > Messages'\n\n*Sign back in with your Apple ID if it has been removed\n\n*Enable 'Send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable'\n\n*It wouldn't hurt to follow these steps on the iPhone 4 as well, as there is a chance the problem is on her end and not yours (Since you haven't noticed the issue happening with any other contacts using Apple devices).\n\n\nThese steps didn't cause any problems for me personally with my stored messages within the Messages app, but as always before doing any troubleshooting backing up your device is a smart move! I did not design iOS so I cannot absolutely guarantee no side effects!\n\nA: Apple has done an inadequate job integrating iMessage and SMS.  Works in most cases, but not well enough to be a reliable means for critical communications.\nTo bypass iMessage and use SMS reliably, go to Settings > Messages and turn off iMessage, then send your message. \n", "Q: Call recording without connection I need to record my incoming and outgoing calls on my iPhone 7, but it seems that all third party app use their network to call and record (which requires an internet connection).

I am using it for web development (Webstorm) and graphic design (Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer). When using the graphic design tools, my MBP can start getting hot... up to 88°C. Now this happens with within 30 minutes or more of using the software. I have to stop my work and wait for it to cool off. \nI have even put my Mac to sleep and went to the store and when I came back my Mac was pretty hot. It seems like sleep mode did not work.  Keyboard lite was on when I got back from the store.  I put it to sleep again and the same behavior happened.\nI also have a 2015 MacBook Pro 15\" and it does not run as hot as the latest 2016 MBPs. Am I missing something?  Is this normal for new MacBooks?   I have checked the apple pages for temperatures but they only provide ENVIRONMENT temperatures and that is it. \n\nA: The normal operating temperature range for silicon is much higher than is comfortable to the touch.  The heatsinks & fans are directly below the top of the keyboard along the hinge opening.  I too have found the upper edge of my MBP to be uncomfortable to touch -- typically when I'm debugging using the F() keys.\nMy recommendation would be to use a product that allows you to manually adjust the fan speed in order to run the fan at a higher-than-minimally-necessary speed to lower the temperatures accordingly.\nI personally use iStat Menus.  In that tool, under 'sensors' is a button to 'Edit Fan Rules'.\nIncorporating feedback from the OP to create a more comprehensive answer:\nAlternatively, if you believe you may have a hardware issue, a trip to the Apple store might be warranted.  The OP had a hardware issue that, while mitigated by the iStatMenus approach, really required a hardware solution, including multiple trips to the Apple store, to ultimately resolve.\n\nA: The first things I would do are to reset both the NVRAM and SMC. Follow the steps below.\nReset the NVRAM\nIMPORTANT: The steps for resetting the NVRAM are different for the Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (i.e. different to all other Macs). \nFor all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nYou should also try resetting the SMC. To do this on your MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nHow does your temperature compare?\nOnce you've reset both the NVRAM and SMC, your MBP should behave how Apple intended. If you still experience temperatures of 88º C and are concerned by this, you can use this resource (which can be filtered) to compare temperature readings with other users. Of course, I'm not sure how many users with Late-2016 MBPs have recorded their temperatures yet.\nHowever, my earlier MBP temp is regularly at 81º C and it performs very well!\nDo you have a problem?\nAnother thing you can do is run Apple Hardware Diagnostics to see if it finds any errors. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\nLet us know how you go.\n\nA: Actually, I just took my MacBook pro to the Apple store (again) and after 3 times of repairs, the MacBook pro 2016 was still having issues with the display, keyboard and overheating. Apple replaced it. Overheating is not normal specially when you are using non intensive programs. I now have a MacBook 2017 that runs at 42°C most of the time, compared to my 2016 that ran most of the time at 60°C or higher. Something to do with the Skylake vs the Kabylake... I think.\n", "Q: MacBook force click as secondary click Is there a way I can use the force click on my MacBook trackpad as a right click (secondary click)?\n\nA: Apps can't override a single finger force click, since that always produces a left click action.\nUsing two fingers, you may as well use the standard two finger tap/click for secondary click.\n\nA: The BetterTouchTool, as mentioned here, cannot replace the force click per se, but offers you some alternatives, such as \"2 finger force click\".\n\n", "Q: MacBook takes screenshots without user input Yesterday my desktop MacBook with Yosemite took a screenshot although I did not use that facility.

The application DISH Anywhere Slingplayer (currently at v. 1.1.0.386) automatically attempts to add itself to the current user's Login Items, both at login time and at app startup time (I use Little Flocker, so I see the attempt to modify ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist.)\nI am trying to disable this, without uninstalling or locking com.apple.loginitems.plist, but I can't figure out what setting/code is pulling this really crappy stunt.\nWhere can I start poking around to find the offending entries? (I already looked in /System/Library/StartupItems/, /System/Library/LaunchAgents/ and ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ but nothing obvious in there.)\n[OS X 10.11.6]\n\nA: The only other 2 locations I can think of that are Mac related and not within the app settings itself are /Library/LaunchDaemons (which you may have already checked when you checked /Library/LaunchAgents) and the preferences files for the app. If you have an appropriate application to examine them (like Xcode) you could take a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.slingmedia.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.slingmedia.setupassistant.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.slingmedia.slingplayer.plist\nI personally do not have a slingbox or the app installed so I can't examine them myself but it would be a really 'crappy stunt' - as you put it so elegantly :) - if the app is designed to execute some code every time it launches to re-initiate the login item settings.\n\nA: If you want to try to \"catch\" whatever event/process is installing the startup item, I highly suggest giving BlockBlock (free) a try. It will pop up immediately upon any injection of a launchagent/daemon and give you the option to block/allow. Works fine on 10.12.4.\nAnother tool that is very useful for working with launchd is LaunchControl. It's not free, but the trial is not crippled in any way. If you simply can't prevent the Slingplayer from adding itself to startup, you might be able to at least neuter the plist by setting its \"RunAtLoad\" flag to false.\n", "Q: Windows 10 can't be removed in Boot Camp Assistant? macOS Sierra (10.12.2) - 2015 rMBP\nInstalled Windows 10 via a direct Windows' ISO using Boot Camp Assistant. Made a partition, it installed fine, worked fine and then it got messed up and needs to be re-installed. Problem is, Boot Camp Assistant doesn't show the Windows 10 partition. Starting up BCA, there is no 'install/remove Windows' option, or any other options to select except to continue to the next screen, which once again doesn't show the Windows partition, but just the full size of my Mac's SSD. It says it'll restore my MBP to it's original 490~ GB. Is this going to erase everything on it?\nHow can I remove this Windows 10 partition if Boot Camp Assistant doesn't recognize it? I'd use Disk Utility but then I'll be left with a phantom Windows boot loader and I don't need that. Is there any way to refresh/reinstall Windows 10 on that partition using the ISO I have?\n\nA: you are going to half to  reformat though disk utility to fat32  and use usb drive your created with bootcamp to instal windows on that same drive again \n", "Q: The Keyboard on my iMac seems to be typing slow and garbled The bluetooth keyboard on my iMac seems  to work for a while then starts to skip letters or mix up letters while I am typing. It seems there is also a delay between the time I type a character and when it shows up on screen. I've switched to my wired keyboard and the same thing happens. If I reboot, the problem goes away for a while, then comes back. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Apple says the following:\nYou may have accidentally set an option that changes how your keyboard operates.\nChoose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Accessibility, then click Keyboard. Make sure Slow Keys is turned off. If Slow Keys is on, you must hold down a key longer than usual before it’s recognized.\nIf the problem persists, enter \"Safe Mode\" to bypass all third party system extensions and only load the required system components.

I fixed this by going to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources -> Set Up Bluetooth Keyboard. I disconnected my keyboard there, switched off the keyboard, turned it on, and reconnected the keyboard. Then the problem disappeared.\n\nA: *\n\n*Hold down the Shift and Option keys ('Alt' on some keyboards) and, at the same time, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.\n\n*Find your keyboard on the device list and select \"Factory Reset\"\n\n*Confirm \"remove\" when prompted.\n\n*Reconnect keyboard.\n\nI tried \"resetting NVRAM and SMC\" as Apple Support mentioned but didn't enough to solve. If the solution above doesn't solve the problem, please try to reset NVRAM and SMC before following the solution steps.\n\nAdditional Info for new MacOS: There is no \"Factory Reset\" option for a specific device in the latest macOS (I'm not sure when it changed).

Thanks for insight!\n\nA: I was searching for the same thing.  I haven't figured out how to do this with Keychain Access or the systemkeychain cli (ie to make migrating logins from one keychain to another easy) but if you just need to recover passwords/keys and plain-text is okay for you, this will sort you out:\nHow to decrypt the system keychain from another mac at the command line\n", "Q: Can't access boot options in MacOS Sierra When booting my mid 2014 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro, holding the option key to choose a startup disk doesn't work. I have just installed Windows 10 on an external SSD and the only way I can choose which to use as my startup disk is to change it from within whichever OS I am using, and my computer will boot into that OS until I change it again.\nI tried resetting the NVRAM by pressing command+option+R+P on startup. All this did was boot into recovery mode. I want to be able to choose the startup disk by pressing option on startup but I don't know how to fix the problem I am having.\n\nA: So this issue is more common than you'd think. To me what you're describing sounds like the issue where the keyboard is not initializing on time to recognize the full key sequence you're holding down. If you're getting to the Recovery Partition by holding command, option, P and R that means that the system is either only recognizing the command and R keys at that time (which happens to be the exact sequence to get to the Recovery Partition), or at the very least not recognizing the option key.\nFirst I would try resetting the SMC in case it's a System Management Controller issue. If you've never done one it's actually pretty easy, you just have to make sure it's charged over 10% first. Shut down your Mac. Disconnect the power source. Press Shift + Control + Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold all 3 keys and the power button for 10 seconds and release. (I do recognize that if the 'option' key is the issue, this reset may fail as well.)\nIf this works you should now be able to reset the PRAM as well as access the startup disk screen. \nIf you still cannot reach the startup disk screen holding option, may I suggest testing with a usb-keyboard? (Not a permanent solution obviously but would give further insight as to what's going on.)\n\nA: Booting Windows from an external disk is not trivial. You need to closely follow the instructions given in a guide like this one to make an external disk bootable for Macs. \nDisclaimer: I found the guide in this answer.\n", "Q: Pressing first letter of user account name does not select user in login window This has been irritating me for a long time and I have not found a solution for this whenever I have looked for one. \nThis problem has perplexed me maybe as far back as Mac OS X 10.7, but I can't be sure. We share a couple of Macs in our family of five and because of that we each have dedicated user accounts. In total that's five separate user accounts. After booting up we get the login window just fine. However, the only way to select the user account you wish to log in to is to click on the user's name. In the past we could just press the first letter of our username and that would automatically select that user for you. But this hasn't happened for a long time now. \nThe reason why I think it may not have occurred since Mac OS 10.7 is that one of our Macs is still on Mac OS X 10.6.8 and on that particular Mac we can still press the first letter of our username to select that account. The Mac this doesn't work on is an iMac using Mac OS X 10.11.6, but like I said, this has been happening for a long time, even before Mac OS X 10.11. It's not the end of the world, but it's surprising how annoying this is for us. \nMY QUESTIONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did Apple remove this feature for some reason?\n\n*If not, is there a setting anywhere to switch this feature back on? \n\n\nA: Did Apple remove this feature for some reason?\nNo, this has not been removed. You should still be able to select users at the login window via the first letter of their user name, or via using the tab and arrow keys.\nIf not, is there a setting anywhere to switch this feature back on? \nAt the outset let me say this may not be the likely solution for you. However, I have seen this behaviour and thought it was worth mentioning in case it helps you or others.\nIf your Mac running El Capitan is a desktop Mac (i.e. iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Pro, etc) and it happens to be plugged into a UPS (i.e. an Uninterruptible Power Supply), then shut down your Mac and unplug it from the UPS. Now plug it into another AC power outlet and reboot it. Check to see how your login window behaves now?\nIf on the off chance this is your situation and your Mac now works as you'd like, an option that may help you is upgrading your OS to macOS Sierra. I say this only because macOS Sierra offers some native support for using a UPS and this may or may not rectify this issue.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (mid 2012) can't start with 3 alarms and sometimes can't wake from sleep I have a MacBook Pro (mid 2012) and I have changed the hard disk to a Crucial_CT250MX200SSD and changed the RAM to CRUCIAL CT8G3S160BM. My Operate System is OS X 10.11.4.\nFirst, I found sometimes my Mac wouldn't wake after sleep and I have to force it to restart. Then after sometime, I found it even couldn't start: black screen with 3 alarms. Sometimes it could start after I tried again, but sometimes it wouldn't. \nI have tried to change the RAM back to the original but the problem still appeared. The Genius Bar couldn't found the problem, neither.\nThis problem usually happened after I put it in my backpack and travel to a different place. So could it be caused by vibration? Actually, when it wouldn't start, pulling the RAM out and reinstalling it could help.\nDoes anyone have met similar problems? What may be the problem of my Mac? Thank you!!\n\nedit (2017.1.26)\nAHT results:\n\n\n\n\nA: The first step would be to check out About Mac computer startup tones and identify which one of these startup tones is the one you're experiencing with your Mid-2012 MBP.\nNear enough is not good enough! If your startup tone does not match exactly one of the ones listed, please comment back and say so and describe which one it is closest to and what the difference is. Unfortunately, not all of the possible startup tones are listed on that page, but identifying the correct tone helps narrow down your problem!\nA possibility?\nThere was a common problem with some MBP models, but this predominantly affected 13\" pre-2012 models. Regardless, there was an issue with logic boards not being able to address the RAM. In many cases it was caused by pressure, over time, on the bottom of the MBP which in turn placed pressure on the logic board. \nYou could test for this by applying some pressure on the bottom case as you start up or wake the computer. Place the pressure as follows: facing the bottom case, apply the pressure to the centre of the case, but slightly to the right (but not all the way).\nIf it's slight physical damage such as this, then you'd need a new logic board. However, you could try and manage the situation by always using the MBP on an even surface (such as on a desk). Also, transporting it in your backpack sounds like some sort of trigger, so you may want to pack it in well so that the bottom case is not being 'bumped' by other items in your backpack, as this may affect how well the RAM is sitting in the slots. Finally, you may want to handle your MBP carefully (e.g. don't pick it up / carry it with only one hand).\n[UPDATE]\nNow that we've established it's definitely an issue concerning your RAM in some way, we need to try and get to the bottom of what's causing it. Please be patient as troubleshooting is often a process of elimination and can take some time. The next step is to do a general test of your hardware. \nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Insert your original 2 x 2GB memory modules\n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow\n\n*When the AHT console appears, select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox and then click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console\n\n*Take a note of the results\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro\n\n*Now remove one of the 2GB memory modules and repeat steps 3 - 10\n\n*Now reinsert the 2GB memory module and remove the other one and repeat steps 3 - 10\n\n*Now remove the 2GB memory module and insert the 8GB model in the first memory slot and repeat steps 3 - 10\n\n*Now remove the 8GB memory module and insert it instead into the second memory slot and repeat steps 3 - 10\n\n*Now insert one of the original 2GB memory modules into the first memory slot and repeat steps 3 - 10\n\n\nNote 1: These tests will take some time. At completion you should have run the Apple Hardware Test six times. Make sure you record the results clearly so you know what they were for each of the six memory configurations.\nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 4 doesn't work, start again at Step 3 and, at Step 4 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run Apple Hardware Test from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n\nA: 3 beeps upon startup definitely signals a RAM issue. The problem is that most people assume that only the actual RAM itself can trigger the beeps when in fact there's a chance that it could be the RAM slots causing the issue. \nWhat you're describing to me sounds a lot like a possible solder point issue between the RAM slots and the logic board itself, unfortunately. What leads me to believe this is 1) you've tested multiple sticks of RAM and the issue still occurs, 2) you believe it's happening after transport so things could be shaking loose temporarily, 3) the genius bar couldn't find an issue when running tests meaning maybe when they were testing it the weary solder points just happened to have settled and were making sufficient contact at the time.\nSince the genius bar proved to be of no help I would strongly recommend something called an Apple Authorized Service Provider for a second opinion. You can find one using this link (click on the 'Service' block):\nhttps://locate.apple.com/ca/en/\nNot to bash Apple Stores but they're busy places. I would try a non-Apple Store location this time as they aren't as busy and aren't trying to shuffle you out in a set period of time to get to their next appointment. They'll likely spend more time with your machine hands-on to get to the bottom of it.\n", "Q: Recreate an alias with the same name and timestamp programmatically Let us develop a utility to batch process legacy alias files.\nImplemented as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder File Service,\n\n*Automator Workflow,\n\n*Applescript,\n\n*Shellscript,\n\n*or whatever else that those the job.\n\n\nPer each file in the batch this should be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the file an alias? (avoid other file types supplied by user error)\n\n*Get its filepath, filename, timestamp, label, tags.\n\n*Delete it.\n\n*Recreate it at the original filepath with the determined filename, timestamp, label, tags.\n\n\nFollowup: I filed a bug report to Apple, see below. Maybe Apple comes up with a solution. But I think some skilled AppleScripter(s) here can come up with a solution within minutes. Would be cool, if we find a solution here, and offer it to the whole macOS community.\n\nBug report to Apple, filed on 2017-01-10\nFinder / HFS+ / filesystem — Refreshing legacy alias files to reduced filesize with batch process\nA LONG LASTING BUG WAS LUCKILY FIXED:\nIn macOS Sierra the file size of aliases was finally reduced dramatically, from multiple megabytes in Mac OS X 10.7-10.11 systems down to only about 1 KB now in macOS Sierra 10.12. (Simply by not including the icon resources, which where mostly anyhow redundant being just a copy of a generic file type icon.)\nPLEASE OFFER A FIX FOR THE BUG LEGACY AS WELL:\nDepending on how heavily aliases are used on a system, there is the potential to save multiple GBs for some users.\nI propose to Apple to offer a batch process for reducing the file size of legacy alias files. With an option to preserve the aliases' original timestamps, as they may have critical information value in some use cases.\nThen you could do a simple Finder search, select the files of your liking (all or only certain) and then drag'n'drop them onto the batch process app or file service or Finder menu command.\nCURRENT WORKAROUND WITH QUICKLOOK ONLY WORKS PARTIALLY\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder > New window (cmd-N) > Search (cmd-F)\n\n*The search criteria show up, set them as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Kind\" is \"Other\", type in \"Alias\"\n\n*You get a Finder search result window. \n\n\n*View as list and sort by size.\n\n\n*\n\n*Then you have the top file size culprits on top.\n\n\n*If you QuickLook a file via SPACE-key then no alias recreation occurs.\n\n*Issue \"File > Show Original\" (cmd-R) on the selected file.\n\n*In the newly opened window, QuickLook the alias files with SPACE.\n\n\nThen certain alias files get recreated. But not all!\nWorking, but only sometimes: PDF, JPEG, ZIP if BetterZip QuickLook plugin is the handler.\nOut of these not all aliases get refreshed.\nIt seems to also depend on the file's overall or individual associated application (Finder \"Open with\" setting, Uniform Type Identifier (UTI), TYPE/CREATOR resource fork) and which QuickLook plugin handles the file type.\nAn recreated file has a dramatically reduced file size (bout 1 KB). Sadly it looses its original timestamp, but gets the current one (equivalent to /usr/bin/touch). I would love to keep the alias timestamp preserved.\n\nA: Create a Service with Automator — Tested on macOS Sierra\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /Applications/Automator.app\n\n*File > New (cmd-N)\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a type of document: \"Service\".\n\n\n*Service receives selected: \"files or folders\" in \"Finder\".\n\n*In the left pane navigate to: Actions > Library > Utilities > Run AppleScript.\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the \"Run AppleScript\" item from the library pane on the left to the source code pane on the right.\n\n\n*Clear the prefilled content entirely.

Macs are picky about RAM, and the RAM you listed isn't what is specified by Apple. Apple requires DDR3 RAM. You have listed DDR3L RAM. It's an easy mistake to make. DDR3L is low-power RAM, requiring 1.35V instead of 1.5V. It is very possible that the RAM will not be compatible.\nAlso, officially, Apple says that the MBP only supports 8GB RAM. However, it is widely recognized that the MBP can support 16GB RAM.\nWhy wouldn't it support 32GB? Because while 16GB DDR3L RAM sticks are available, 16GB DDR3 RAM sticks don't exist. There is no such thing as a 16GB RAM stick that matches Apple's specifications (PC3-12800 DDR3 1600 MHz type 204-pin RAM).\nEdit: Although crucial says that the 16 GB RAM stick can be used in place of DDR3, it says it is not compatible with the Mac:\n\n\nA: It does not work!

For me it only happens with vim running on a remote machine using ssh. Vim does seem to be the common factor.\nAccording to this Google groups thread, the problem can be reproduced by putting this into a file:\n/goldbaum2-7.bmv already exists; use -y to recreate \n/des_surveyBuildup_11-7.bmv already exists; use -y to recreate \n/lsst_telescope12-22.bmv 1-2660 /fe0/deslsst/telescope/comps/lsst_obj_12-22_comp4k/lsst_obj_12-22_comp4k.%04d.png \nimg2bmv -f 30 -p 3 -N 6 -L 42  -t 512x360 -w 4096x2160  -w 3840x2160 -t 480x540  -o /fraid0/movies/ren400My_vars_grids_labels_11-8.bmv 1-2881 /fe0/deslsst/renaissance/comps/ren400My_vars_grids_labels_3840_11-8/ren400My_vars_grids_labels_3840_11-8.%04d.png \nDon't know how to make these movies:  -f 3 \n\nThen editing it with vim and executing the command sequence 3jdfo. This reproduces the problem for me.\nThis is clearly a bug in Terminal.app's handling of an escape sequence generated by vim. Hopefully there will be a fix in the next OSX update.\nUpdate: I have also seen the problem with command-line history editing with zsh in vi mode. Clearly a problem in Terminal.app.\nUpdate 2: The test case no longer crashes Terminal.app after the 10.12.4 update. Solution: Update to 10.12.4.\n\nA: Using Sierra 10.12.3 and macvim installed via macports, I do not get crashes, per se, when running macvim through the Terminal.app, but it is incredibly \"laggy\".  In particular, switching focus back and forth between the macvim window and any Terminal.app window can take up to a minute.\nSomeone in another thread on nabble claimed that the crashes with vim can be avoided by declaring Terminal.app to be anything other than xterm, xterm-16, or xterm-256.  That might fix the crash problem but it does not help with the sluggishness I am experiencing.\n", "Q: Bootcamp not asking for USB I bought a new Macbook and i'm trying to install windows on this computer with bootcamp (i added windows to my other macs too without problem) but this app won't gives me the option to choose the usb drive where he downloads the drivers and boot files... why is the first 1 - 2 step gone ? This way if the windows install starts it tells me there is a problem because no boot file is there... why i can't choose the usb ? did apple updated something ? :/ can't find any solutions... any idea ? Thank you  \n\nA: Please have a look at this article: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/10/01/el-capitan-boot-camp-windows-changes/\nJust follow the next steps and windows should install without using a USB drive.\n\nA: I recently had a similar problem. Apparently, BootCamp Assistant doesn't require a USB-stick anymore. In my case I used Brigadier – a neat little tool that will identify and download the correct Bootcamp drivers for you. \nConcerning your boot problem, I am not sure what is going on.

I am looking for an iPhone online but, want to know if a particular phone would work with GSM carriers outside US. Is there a proper way to find that?

The only functionality available is to use the Forward button to quote a copy of the email (with or without the original attachments).\n(On macOS mail.app, right-click on a message and select Forward as Attachment.)\n\nA: Looks like things have moved on since the original post, but unfortunately Apple has still not added this basic functionality to the iOS version of mail. It should be as simple as selecting “forward as attachment” but it’s not. You need it so you can forward spam and other emails unadulterated so the headers and other information that is normally not displayed is available to the recipient. A good example is forwarding a spam email to an anti spam services or a phishing email to the police (fraud squad). These are really important user stories that Apple seems to have forgotten about.\nSo this is what worked for me on an iPad running 15.4\n\n*\n\n*Start a new email\n\n*Hit the … at the top \n\n*Choose split screen \n\n*Once you have mail with your new message on one side and your list of messages on the left, select the message and drag it into the message on the right. This can be really tricky as mail tries to show you previews etc before it works out you want to drag and drop.\n5.You should now see an attachment in you mail with a “.elm” extension. \nThat’s it. Now you can submit spam reports from your iPad\n\nA: Answer from 2/10/19 is almost right as of IOS 14.7.\nThis works but it is clumsy. Hey Apple fixit?\n\n*\n\n*Click on the email you want to send as an attachment.\n\n*Click on the arrow at the bottom of the email and click the print option.\n\n*Hold your finger down on the picture of the email that shows up on the print screen until it pops up onto a new full sized screen.\n\n*Click on the “send to” button on the top right. From there you select the email icon which opens a new email with the original as an attachment as a PDF.\n\n*Fill in the Email send to address and subject and body.\n\n\nA: Finally, Apple have added a proper (albeit finicky) way to do this, so you can do true forwarding of emails as attachments, headers-and-all (and not just forwarding as PDFs, as suggested earlier in this thread)...  For reference, I'm using an iPhone XS Max on iOS 16.1.1.\nIn order to forward an email as attachment, you have to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open a new email (this will be the mail to which you attach the other email).\n2.Minimise the new email (by dragging the email down towards the bottom of the screen until it minimises as a Draft email)\n\n*Go to the folder containing the email you want to attach, and locate the mail in question (don't open it!)\n\n*Hold down on the email you want to attach, until it \"pops out\" of the folder and shows you a preview.\n\n*Keep your finger on the screen and drag down to the bottom of the screen.  When its at the bottom, all available draft emails will show.\nMove your finger onto the email you want to attach the email to, and hold until it maximises.\n\n*When your draft email maximises, lift your finger to drop the other email onto it as an attachment.\n\nIt can be a little awkward, and you might not do the exact finger moves first time - but it does work.\n\nA: You can take a screenshot of the original email. This will save in Photos. You can then attach it to the new email. \n\nA: I realize this question was posted in 2017 but considering it still shows up as a top result on Google I figured I’d provide an updated answer. You can now send an email as an attachment on the iPhone (at least I could on the iPhone X) although it was a little weird how I had to do it.\n1) Click on the email you want to send as an attachment.\n2) Click on the arrow at the bottom of the email and click the print option.\n3) Hold your finger down on the picture of the email that shows up on the print screen until it pops up onto a new full sized screen.\n4) Click on the “move to folder” button on the top right and from there you can select your email which will attach a copy of the email to a new email.\n", "Q: Modulate Time in Logic Pro X? Before I started using Logic Pro, I was using Fruity Loops, and in that program you can very easily modulate time (I hope that is the correct term for this).  By this I mean it acts like the sound is on a record and you can push and pull the record while it spins.  This sound is like what you hear in most dubstep songs.  A very easy way to do this in Fruity Loops was using the Gross Beat plugin.\nI have looked up how to do this, but all I can find is the Flex Time option for sound files, this only speeds up and slows down the clip linearly.  I would like to be able to do an ease automation, and I am using MIDI, not actual sound.\nIn Logic Pro I have found a few things that produce a similar sound.\n\n\n*\n\n*Glide I can make the MIDI instrument have a glide, and I can make it glide from the note that was played before to the one I want it to play.  But this is very inconvenient because it makes me have to create a note that I do not want before the note I want the effect done to (which will create unwanted sounds that can break the flow of the song.\n\n*Cutoff Changing the cutoff value through automations can create a similar noise, but this does not effect the time at all, and will create more work than I would like.\n\n*BPM I can automate the BPM, but this does the opposite of changing the cutoff value, it only slows it down and doesn't create any sounds.  It does, due to me using the Tape Delay, create an annoying high pitched click because of the dramatic speed up after the automation.  Changing the BPM also, obviously, messes up the BPM of the song, by this I mean it makes the song slower in that part but doesn't make it faster when its done to catch back up to where it is supposed to be.  This also effects the entire song, and not one specific instrument.\n\n\nWhat I want, specifically, is a way to change the speed and pitch of the instrument for a short time, through automation, and when it is set back to normal it will speed the audio back up (or slows it down) so that the instrument catches up to where it should be.\nIs there a built in way to do this in Logic Pro X? If there isn't, is there a plugin I can get to accomplish this?\n\nA: You can use the fade tool for this and use the automation curve tool to adjust to your requirements.\nBy default the fade tool is set for volume fade in/fade out, but you can change this to speed to get the same effect. It's not like a DJ spin back, but a stop/start.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How well does the Samsung Gear S3 watch work with iPhone? I've read that Samsung announced compatibility with iOS for their Gear S3 watches. \nAs iOS is a peculiar closed system, what would be compatible? Will it be able to reply to Whatsapp or Telegram messages? Record voice?\nI've searched for some information but found nothing. \n\nA: According to what Samsung has announced to date, the Gear S3 will be able to pair with specific iOS devices:\n\nCompatible devices: iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPhone 6, iPhone 6+, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S+, iPhone 7, iPhone 7+ and iPhone SE (iOS 9.0 and above).\n\nSamsung will create iOS apps to take advantage of whatever the Gear S3 has to offer.  So it appears that 'compatibility with iOS' just means they'll use Bluetooth to communicate with the iPhone and also make apps for it.\n", "Q: How to Change Hyperlink Color in macOS Notes The hyperlinks in Notes on macOS are essentially yellow on white, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nI would like to change the color to any darker color to improve the contrast, but how? I have tried to highlight hyperlinks to change their color, but the color remains the same even after selecting a color for them.\n\nA: Not sure when this started, but I found something relevant to this question just today. I really hated the color of the links in Notes, too, and had come across this question months ago and wanted to return to add my discovery:\nLink color is mostly connected to highlight Accent color in Sys Prefs. I'm running 10.14.6 and using Dark Mode. I recently changed my highlight color from grey to orange (the orange looks good against the slate color of dark mode). I just happened to open a note containing a long list of links. It took a second to realize, \"I can read these links!\" Then, \"I can read these links because they're orange!\" I tried changing the highlight color to blue and the links turned yellow (against Dark Mode that now works) not blue. So mode also plays a part in determining link color in Notes.\nEDIT: The change in Accent color changes the link color. Changing the Accent color might also change the Highlight color but they don't necessarily have to be the same.\nSystem Preferences > General > Accent Color\nHope that helps someone.\n\nA: As someone who's done a lot of UX (user experience) work over the years, I have to admit I was very surprised when I first saw the hyperlink colour in Apple's Notes app. Not so surprised that someone would actually propose it, but very surprised it passed through all the review processes at Apple.\nAnyway, I do have a couple of workaround options that may help you until Apple addresses this, as I fully expect they will at some point. These options are far from perfect, but if the default hyperlink colour is enough of an issue, they are worth considering.\nHyperlinks displaying the actual URL\nIf your hyperlink text displays the actual URL (e.g. \"apple.stackexchange.com\" instead of \"Ask Different\") you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the yellow link\n\n*From the context menu, select Remove Link\nYou will notice that the link text now changes to black* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double-click) and then right-clicking to select the Open URL option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.\n*If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with http: etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link. \nHyperlinks displaying words\nIf your hyperlink text displays words instead of an actual URL (e.g. \"Ask Different\" instead of \"apple.stackexchange.com\") you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the yellow link\n\n*From the context menu, select Edit Link...\n\n*This will open up the Link Destination window with the full URL already selected. Copy (commandC) or cut (commandX) the link and click on the OK button.\n\n*In your note, Paste (commandV) the URL over the original hyperlink text\n\n*Right-click on what is still a yellow link\n\n*From the context menu, select Remove Link\nOnce again you will notice that the link text now changes to black* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double-click) and then right-clicking to select the Open URL option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.\n*If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with http: etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link. \n\nA: \nHowever, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double-click) >and then right-clicking to select the Open URL option from the context menu.\n\nDouble-clicking the modified link does not work, because the entire line is selected... including whatever that unseen character is at the end of the line.\nThat character must be removed (de-selected) in order for the 'Open URL' contextual menu item to appear.   That will open the URL and will not change the color of the URL as it appears in notes.\nIt's still more painful than it ought to be.\n\nA: I had ordinary text being converted into links so I did the same as above: removing all the links by copying the complete note file (command A, then command C) and and then doing a paste and match (command-alt-shift-v) which reverted everything to ordinary text in black.\n\nA: I am trying to manage hashtags using notes, cutting and pasting. The link color and function is a pain for this job. One workaround is to paste the text in using Paste Matching Format, this will strip out the links automatically.\n\nA: As of Feb 8, 2019, the link color is still tan.

Is this possible? \nI've been trying to find a way, but no success until now. \n\nA: Keynote doesn't have a \"Customize Touch Bar\" option in the menu bar under \"View\", so it looks there is no way to customize it (macOS Mojave).\n", "Q: Add all songs from Top Charts to a playlist How to add all songs from 'Top charts' to my playlist at once (not one by one song)?\nThere is no options exist for this playlist to do it.\n\nA: This would be a neat feature, but there is no way to do this.\nAnd, to be honest, I think it'd be tricky to implement without also providing the user a number of options they need to select.\nThe problem is that songs in the top charts are constantly changing, so the user would need a way of choosing how this is managed? \nFor example, let's say it's a Top 50 chart:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the songs are downloaded, do they remain downloaded when they are no longer in the Top 50? \n\n*Should the playlist auto update when the Top 50 changes? \n\n*If not, how long should the playlist exist before it does check the Top 50 again? \n\n*What about the ordering of songs? Should they remain in Chart order? If so, should the playlist reflect the current order at any given point of time?\n\n\nThe list goes on...\nHowever, the idea does have merit. I suggest you send Apple feedback about this. I know they're focusing quite strongly on Apple Music etc and something like this is certainly worthy of consideration. I'd make sure your feedback covers the fact that you've considered some of the issues of implementing this and, if possible, suggest how you'd deal with those.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Windows VM from bootable SSD? I have made a bootable Windows 10 SSD, which I use to boot into Windows on my iMac. This works fine, Windows runs natively and SSD over USB 3 if fast.\nBut now, I want to have my cake and eat it to - I would like to be able to boot into OS X (Sierra) and start a Windows VM which would boot from the same SSD instead of virtual hard disk.

Why can't I disable my Macbook Pro keyboard with a shortcut?\n\nA: It would be interesting to know where that information came from, as, as far as I am aware, it is totally incorrect. \nThese are Accessibility Controls...\nOpt x5 is to enable Mouse Keys; that allows your 10-key pad to act like a mouse.\nCtrl/F1 I think you are confusing with \"Full Keyboard Access\" which allows more complete navigation using only the keyboard.\nIt Toggles between this :-\n\nand this\n\nThe only way I know to actually disable it is to use a utility called KeyboardCleanTool [freeware]\n", "Q: How do I set the cover photo of a \"shared\" Photos album? I understand how to set the cover (\"key\") photo of an Apple Photos album, but I can't see how to change the cover photo of a \"shared\" (copied) album.\nHow do I set the cover photo of a \"shared\" Photos album?\n\nA: You can't.\nWith shared iCloud photo albums the key photo will always be the photo that was uploaded last.\nUpdate: This is still valid for iOS 12.1.2.\n\nA: Actually, you can. Open an image to full view in the Shared Album, then in the menu select Image -> Make Key Photo. The key is to open the image to full view, it's not possible to select a Key Photo from the thumbnail view.\n\nA: There's no official way to do this, but you can take a screenshot of the photo that you want to set as the key photo and then add the screenshot to the shared album because, as others mentioned, the album cover is always the most recently posted media.\n\nA: There's no way to do this. Though you can temporarily set a \"key photo\" (though a surprisingly awkward procedure), that will reset to the first photo in the album as soon as any photos are added.\n", "Q: AppleScript – Pages export to PDF fails due to Sandbox permissions I'm trying to create an Automator workflow to export selected Pages documents to PDF.

I have an iPhone, and MacBook Air. If I delete a photo off of my iPhone, will this delete across all devices, or is there a way to only save in the cloud?\nEdit: I am using iOS 10, macOS Sierra, and I am using iCloud across devices.\n\nA: You didn't say what version of iOS or macOS you're using nor did you mention if you used iCloud or not.  This answer applies to the latest versions of all those.\nIf you are currently using iCloud to sync your photos across devices, once you delete a photo on any of those devices, it will also delete on iCloud.  Here is an Apple site about iCloud and how to use it.\niCloud is a syncing system designed to give you access to all your content regardless of what device you're using.\nIf you want to delete the photo from your device but keep it in a cloud solution, you need to use a 3rd-party cloud service.

I enter path in the search box, and select it to search the current folder (which is my default anyway). The tool tip indicates Filenames Name matches: path.\nWhat I see is 110 items, none of which even contain the string path, let alone match.\n\nWhat does the finder think I am looking for, and what do the results actually mean?\nThis is a relatively new iMac running MacOS Sierra. \n\nA: *\n\n*In the Finder, use command-F to get a Finder search window.  You will get:\n\n\n*There is now a bar with criteria added.  You see a pop-up menu \"Kind\" followed by \"is\" and another pop-up menu \"Any\".  Click the \"Kind\", and choose \"Name\" from that menu:\n\n\n*There now is a pop-up menu just following \"Name\", select \"contains\" from that, and type the word \"path\" in the field that follows.\n\n*You can add criteria by clicking the + sign at the right of the search bar.\nSpotlight does seem to \"power\" the default search field in Finder windows.  I use Spotlight only in desperation, as it almost never ever finds what I'm looking for.  But with the search criteria in the Finder's search window I usually book success.\nSo, remember:  command-F gets you a Finder search window with a criteria bar, and that certainly helps.\n\nA: There are two issues here: by default, Finder will:\n\n\n*\n\n*search the contents of files as well as their names \n\n*search either your entire Mac hard disk, or the current folder and all its subfolders.\n\n\nTo solve the first problem, you need to to tell Finder just to match filenames. When you typed \"path\" into the search box, a dropdown menu should have appeared, with the option \"Name matches: path\". Select that, instead of just pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can type name:path into the search box, which has the same effect.\nYou can't really solve the second problem with Finder; even when restricting the search to the current folder, there is no way to exclude its sub-folders. For that, you'll need a third-party tool, or learn to use commands in the Terminal like ls *path*.\n\nA: You can also add criteria to the pop-up list.  A useful one is the file extension.  E.g. here is the result for a search for all files that are images with file extension jpeg (not jpg) opened in the last 3 weeks:\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016 does not turn on I have a MacBook Pro 2016 with a touch bar, and without prior warning it is now refusing to turn on. Pressing the Touch ID button does nothing: no chime, no screen activity, no computer noise, no Caps Lock LED. Resetting the SMC has no effect.\nIs there any kind of diagnosis I can perform before bringing it to the Apple Store? Is there some secret key combination that will make it tell me where it's failing? Can I somehow connect it to a second computer and use that to perform a diagnosis?  \nGuides freely available through Google don't say very much beyond these steps that I've already taken.\nI guess my real question is:\n\nWhat will Apple itself do before starting to dissemble it? Can I do that myself?\n\n\nA: If you press the power button and nothing happens, there's no special or secret combination of keystrokes that will get you into diagnostic mode,\nGiven that it is so new (and still under warranty), you want an exchange, not a repair.  This is way too new for you to be having this type of difficulty.\nAs to your question, \"what will Apple do?\"  They will look at it, press the power button, check your charger and then then they will give you another machine.  They won't attempt to repair it.\n\nA: There is one more thing you can try other than just mashing the power button. \nYou can try to reset the System Management Controller (SMC) by unplugging the power from the MacBook Pro, holding down the left hand control, shift and option keys and then holding down the power button for 10 seconds. Then plug the power back in and try turning it back on as normal. \nHere is the thing that made a difference in my case: I'd have to wait approximately 3-4 hours with the computer unplugged for the battery to completely drain before it would work. (I worked this out after a trip to the Genius Bar.)\n\nA: MACBOOKS HAVE A SAFETY MECHANISM FOR HUMIDITY. Observe, if your macbook does not turn on on rainy days, especially when you live in tropics where humidity and condensation are extreme, do the following : remove screws and the back lid and dry the inside with hairdryer for about 1 minute. Also you can take your mackbook for a short while to an air conditioned room, which also makes it turn on. Google this topic, there are more reports and solutions available. Crazy, huh ? Of course you should not keep electronics in such humid conditions but realistically, how are you supposed to comply with that in some climates ? I was agonizing with this for about a year, I even almost resorted to buying a new macbook, before I came up with the idea to google something so insane... and it was the solution.\n", "Q: Apple Keyboard with numeric keypad problems I have a very strange issue with my wired Apple Keyboard with numeric keypad.

The option key works in some shortcuts and in others it doesn't. The next (F9) and the mute (F10) button don't work. Typing some diacritics works, but not in all cases. It's seems totally random.\nFirst I thought something's badly configured in macOS (newest Sierra release), but the keyboard has these same issues with every other computer.

Those locations are in turn determined when a device with GPS accesses the same wifi. This can be accurate down to the building.\n\n*geolocating your IP address. Usually accurate to the neighbourhood level, occasionally down to the building.\n\n\nYou can block the first one by turning off location services and/or changing your wifi access point (meaning you buy a brand new one, and then never use it with a phone).\nYou cannot block the second one. The website needs your IP address in order to reply to you, and if it has your IP address it can get your location.\nTry a VPN service. Your IP will then be Somewhere Else. This will break searches like \"Find  near here\".\n", "Q: App Approved but IAP's Waiting for review, not getting reviewed We have had an App go through the approval cycle several times and while the status went into \"Pending Developer Release\", our IAP's never changed out of the \"Waiting for Review\" status.  We have tried resubmitting and also creating new product ID's and then resubmitting.\nBoth times yielded the same result.  Are we missing something or is there something we are missing?\n\nA: I noticed from experience, that even when your app is approved, the IAP can take quite a while to get approved, especially when you have translated the IAP in (many) other languages, it seems that those needs to go to different teams that can understand the translation, to see if you deliver on your promise.\nSo in that mean time users get \"Product not available\" in the App. In my latest app I have 2 IAPs, the 2st one is approved 2 days after the App approval, the second which has more languages, is not yet approved (3rd day now).\n\nA: Apple has support for developers as part of your service.

Now there is no longer an option to disable it in the 'zoom' section of 'accessibility'.  As this is a new feature, there is no documentation of this issue yet.\nI would appreciate any help, as this makes the the touch bar near useless.\n\nA: I got it to work. \nSelecting the \"System Preferences\" from the top left \"Apple\" icon or just clicking the \"System Preferences\" icon directly both result in the \"Enable Touch Bar Zoom\" checkbox NOT showing up. \nThe only way to consistently get it was to right click or click and hold on the \"System Preferences\" icon found in the dock, then select \"Accessibility\", then select the \"Zoom\" tab. \nNo idea why it's any different, but it is.\n\nA: I kept trying the solution mentioned by J Track with no avail, yet after long trial and errors I was finally able to have the checkbox reappear by trying to edit the Universal Access plist then opening System Preferences (preferably from the dock):\nplutil -replace closeViewDFRZoomEnabled -bool false ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist\n\nStrangely, even though the command should set this property as false, I found the property still checked in the UI, but at least I was able to turn it off again.

I have two RAM chips in my Mac. How can i get to know, how many of them can i upgrade? I mean, it could happen, that one (or even two) of them are soldered on…?\nAnd, how is it possible to get out who is the manufacturer of RAM? - three are only cryptical codes, like 0xAD00000000000000… I wouldn't like to buy RAM from manufacturer, who doesn't match with the RAM already installed.\nIt goes about the following hardware:\nMacBook Pro\n15 Zoll, 2,4 2,2 GHz\nProzessor  2,2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nNVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT 128 MB\nSerial Number: W874214LX91\n\nRAM:\n\nBANK 0/DIMM0:\nSize:   2 GB\nTyp:    DDR2 SDRAM\nTact Frequency: 667 MHz\nStatus: OK\nManufacturer:   0xAD00000000000000\nPart Number:    0x48594D503132355336344350382D59352020\nSerial Number:  0x00006170\n\nBANK 1/DIMM1:\nSize:   1 GB\nTyp:    DDR2 SDRAM\nTact Frequency: 667 MHz\nStatus: OK\nManufacturer:   0x7F7F7F7F7F7FC100\nPart Number:    0x4232594A55533733464E3120202020202020\nSerial Number:  0x00000058\n\n\nA: Apple did not solder RAM in those days, so you should be good to go. As far as the manufacturer is concerned, it really doesn't matter. As long as the modules are from a good (and ideally the same) manufacturer (crucial has been good in my experience), match the required specs which you can find at sites such as http://www.appleserialnumberinfo.com by entering your serial number, you'll be good to go.\nI would also advise that you use the same sizes of memory modules in both banks. You currently have an imbalance, which can negatively impact performance.\n\nA: Using your serial number I was able to determine that you're running a Macbook Pro 15\" from Late 2007. These models generally came standard with 2GB of RAM. Both the link that @William T Froggard provided (http://www.appleserialnumberinfo.com) and an application called Mactracker state that the maximum amount of RAM Apple recommends for this model is 4GB. People have reported having success with up to 6GB, but functionality is not guaranteed by Apple. This would mean that the optimum setup for your Mac would be to have two 2GB modules of RAM installed, one in each slot. (As @William T Froggard also mentioned, Macs function better with RAM that is installed in identical pairs.)\nOnce again the brand name/manufacturer doesn't matter too much (although Crucial and Kingston are very well known, established names). The most important part is that the RAM is 200-pin PC2-5300 (667MHz) DDR2 SO-DIMM.\nMacbook Pro Tech Specs, as per Mactracker.app:\n\n", "Q: The checkmark is not shown in the mac \nThe checkmark is not shown is the os, I don't know what is going on with this bug?

I'm in a bit of a pickle. The iMac will prompt me to reinstall OSX Lion, but it only has 1GB of RAM, and the Lion upgrade requires 2GB, so it doesn't allow me to do that. Since the computer was restored to factory conditions, it doesn't have any backups either.\nAdditionally, it is not recognizing my live USB with Linux Mint on it under \"Startup Devices\". It does recognize that there is a USB installed under Disk Utility. \nThis is what I get on startup (and no boot options seem to work, such as pressing C or command + option + 0). \nSo basically what I need to do is figure out if its possible to boot into a live environment of Linux Mint and then install it. I'm quite sure the USB is okay. It has a Fat32 filesystem and reads just fine in other devices.\nAny helps is appreciated!\n\nA: I haven't used this process to install Linux Mint, but I have used it to install other operating systems on earlier iMacs and MacBook Pros. So I offer this answer in the hope it works for you, but if not, it may help others.\nI see two ways to install an OS from a bootable USB on earlier Macs that didn't support booting from USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the destination Mac in Target Disk Mode\n\n*Remove the HD from the destination Mac and insert it into another Mac or external case\n\n\nObviously the above options aren't for everyone. Both options requires access to another Mac that will boot from USB and the second one requires the user being comfortable with the process (in some cases the process would be a nightmare, in others fairly straightforward).\nTarget Disk Mode\nThe following is a general guide on what's involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the 2007 iMac in Target Disk Mode by holding down the T key during startup. You'll know when it's finished by seeing an icon floating around the screen. \n\n*Use an appropriate FireWire cable to connect the iMac to another Mac capable of booting from USB. (Note: You may need to use an adaptor if the other Mac does not have native FireWire support - e.g. Thunderbolt > FireWire adapter).\n\n*Insert the bootable USB (e.g. for Linux Mint) into the second Mac (i.e. the one capable of booting from the USB).\n\n*Start the second Mac and immediately hold down the Option key until you see the startup disk manager.\n\n*Select the bootable USB from the list and press Enter.\n\n*Follow the steps to install the OS (e.g. Linux Mint) onto the hard drive of the first Mac in Target Disk Mode (e.g. the 2007 iMac).\n\n*When complete, shutdown both computers and disconnect the FireWire cable between the two Macs.\n\n*Start the first Mac normally (hopefully to see it boot from the OS you just installed).\n\n\nRemove the HD\nThis involves removing the hard drive from the first Mac and inserting it into another Mac or an external case. However, choosing this option may depend on the model of your first Mac (e.g. removing a hard drive from a Mac Pro is a lot easier than removing it from an iMac) and may also depend on the model of your other Mac (e.g. a HD from an iMac will not fit into a MacBook).\nSo, this option will be easier if you use an appropriate external case, and if the original Mac is not hard to work with. If you use an external case, then the process is similar to using Target Disk Mode, because a Mac started in Target Disk Mode is effectively an external hard drive.\nObviously I can't cover all possible scenarios here, but this option is not so easy for an iMac (not even the 2007 model used by the OP). But for users comfortable with doing this, the process is broadly as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the HD from the first Mac\n\n*Insert the HD into an appropriate external case\n\n*Connect the external case to the Mac capable of booting from USB\n\n*Insert the bootable USB (e.g. for Linux Mint) into the second Mac (i.e. the one capable of booting from USB)\n\n*Start the second Mac and immediately hold down the Option key until you see the startup disk manager.\n\n*Select the bootable USB from the list and press Enter.\n\n*Follow the steps to install the OS (e.g. Linux Mint) onto the correct hard drive (i.e. the one from the other Mac)\n\n*When complete, shutdown your Mac \n\n*Disconnect the external case\n\n*Remove the HD from it and insert it back into the first Mac\n\n*Start the first Mac normally (hopefully to see it boot from the OS you just installed).\n\n\nNote: If you're in a situation where you can install the hard drive into another Mac, then at Step 2 you would install it into the Mac instead of the external case and you'd also skip Steps 3 and 9. \n", "Q: Home button unresponsive after left inactive I run a small-time iPhone repair business. I have done almost 200 LCD replacements to this point so I am moderately experienced.\nI replaced the LCD on an iPhone 6. The home button works fine while the phone is being used. However, when the iPhone is left inactive for a period of time ,at least a minute, the home button will \"sleep\" and not respond to touch. If I press the power button to \"wake\" the iPhone the home button will work. This is odd to me that it only works while the iPhone is being used.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There are a range of possible fixes. Have you tried the following?\nRecalibrating\nRecalibrating the home button appears to fix the issue for a majority of the users. It happened with our iPhones here. When the home button gets a bit tricky and unresponsive, this is what we usually do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an app. Any default iOS app. (Weather, Clock etc.)\n\n*Hold the Sleep/Wake button (Power) till the ‘Slide to power off’ appears\n\n*Now press and hold the home button till the slide goes away and you get to the homescreen.\n(You’ll notice that the app is closed)\n\n\nThis should fix the calibration issues and make the home button work better. Of course, while the thing works well, the calibration appears to wane away after sometime. For some, this happens within a week or so. For some, this happens after several weeks or months.\nCleaning / Dusting\nSweat causes moisture. There’s dust all around. And with the kind of little spaces that the home button’s edge has, it is very much possible that the unresponsiveness is due to dust clogged in it. Usually, repair takes up a lot of time and money so you can try cleaning the thing yourself.\nOne of the best ways to clean the home button without having to play around with the screws is to just press the button and air dust it. This usually blows away some of the clog dust and helps you get back some good responsiveness with the home button.\nIf all else fails:\nReset: go to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings. Have a data backup just in case.\n", "Q: Automator Service: Parent of input from files or folders I cannot find any information on this, so I hope somebody with experience can fill in the gap.\nI am writing a simple Automator Service, and I can’t get past the first step.\n\n\n*\n\n*The script is a Service\n\n*Service receives selected files or folders in Finder.app\n\n*Run AppleScript\nThe script is\non run {input,parameters}\n    set test to container of input -- Can’t make container into type reference.\n    display dialog test as string\n    return input\nend run\n\nThe input parameter has the selected file or folder, and all I want to do at this stage is to get the parent folder of the selected item.

The phone number shown in Messages and Facetime is my old number (now incorrect) - in this screenshot with area code 664\n \nThe phone number in my phone, Apple account and iCloud etc. is my new (correct) number - in this screenshot with area code 661.\n \nI have tried a number of suggestions I've found online: turning off iMessage & Facetime and restarting phone; changing phone number and changing back; signing out of AppleID throughout phone then signing back in - however I still can't activate them.  \nPlease note that facetime and imessage are working fine using my appleID, and I'm able to send/receive SMS (including SMS from Apple).  \nThe issue seems to be that Messages/Facetime is trying to activate on the old number but I can't change that number to the new one.\nHow can I change that activation phone number and activate iMessage and Facetime for my new number?\n\nA: According to Apple (https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201349) you should follow these steps:\n\"If the phone number that you want to remove belongs to an iPhone that you can't access, change your Apple ID password. This removes all phone numbers from your iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. Calls or messages for the removed numbers won't appear on those devices anymore.?\nI would sign out of everything associated with your Apple ID on all of your devices before changing your password (including iTunes Store, App Store, iCloud, Facetime, iMessage, etc).  It saves quite the headache with password prompts popping up and things just not working properly due to things like 'Find My iPhone' being so stubborn. Having a backup of your iPhone probably wouldn't hurt either.\nIf this does not work I would strongly advise to call Apple. It's been a few years since I've had to troubleshoot this issue but if memory serves me well I believe there is something they actually have to do from their end if a phone number is 'stuck' to an Apple ID.\n\nA: I ran into the same issue.\nThe only thing I can suggest is:\n1) Sign out and remove/delete icloud accounts as NYKg noted.\n2) if another apple device is logged in (ipad or iMac, etc.), I had to do the same for my ipad\n3) hard reboot\nafter that, everything worked for me, my old number was still listed as an option under the imessages, but it was grayed out and impossible to select.\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me was put my SIM in a different iPhone FaceTime and iMessage was successfully activated on that phone then I put the SIM back to my iPhone and now it worked!\n", "Q: How to block an app's access to a specific website using the hosts file?

I don't mean optical checks. Maybe some kind of system values, etc.\n\nA: Take a look at the hard drive. The SMART statu should have lots on informations.\nHere is how to look at it: \nIs there a utility for mac that shows the information of an SSD like the health etc…?\nA samble output from my computer:\n0x01  0x008  4           17080  ---  Lifetime Power-On Resets\n0x01  0x010  4           13034  ---  Power-on Hours\n0x01  0x018  6     71009610622  ---  Logical Sectors Written\n0x01  0x020  6       689785468  ---  Number of Write Commands\n0x01  0x028  6     96669153261  ---  Logical Sectors Read\n0x01  0x030  6      1474232041  ---  Number of Read Commands\n\nIt's even less likely they would have replaced the hard drive than the battery :)\n\nA: The only thing I can think of that cannot be tricked by an Erase and Install of the OS is the cycle count on the battery, provided it's the original battery. Essentially this number tells you how many times the battery has been depleted and recharged.\nCycle count of the battery:\nClick the Apple menu and then 'About this Mac > System Report... > Hardware > Power' and look for \"Cycle Count\" under 'Battery Information > Health Information'\nThe lower the number the better. Now there is a chance that the reseller you bought it off of replaced the battery, but it's highly unlikely. It's a lot of work to remove and reinstall a battery in these models (see the full 34 steps here) so unless the battery is faulty or nearing the end of its life cycle, it just wouldn't make sense to replace it.\nYou could also call Apple Support and ask if the serial number of that machine has been previously registered under a name other than yours. They cannot tell you the previous name or any other information on the account if it has been registered before (due to privacy laws), but I don't see why they couldn't just let you know if the machine has already been registered with them in the past.\n\nA: One approach is to look in the Library/Receipts folder; this will show you\na lot of installations/updates, with dates, and gives a good indication of usage\nthat isn't tied to any user (the user info can be easily removed).  That seems to\nwork for older OS X (10.9).\nOn recent OS releases, the Receipts folders are deprecated; instead of looking\nfor install/update traces there, open System Information, and look at Software/Installations for a listing of installed patches/updates etc., with dates.   In the last six years, keeping my system updated has logged hundreds\nof entries there.\n", "Q: macOS windows requiring an explicit click to make active, before UI elements inside can be clicked I'm a new Mac user, having been issued with a MacBook Pro when I started a new job three months ago.  A Windows and Linux user before, I'm now getting quite used to the differences with using Apple's desktop environment.\nOne thing that is still slowing me down a little is the requirement to explicitly click in an application window to make it active, before the UI elements inside that window can be interacted with.\nFor example, if I have two browser windows open side by side with the left one active, it takes two clicks to follow a link in the right hand window: one to make the window active, one to click the link.\nThis is in contrast to Windows or Linux, where you can click on a UI element in a inactive window and that single click will both activate the window and the element in it.\nA similar issue is trying to copy and paste text between windows.  I can select and copy text in an active terminal or editor, then paste it into another with 'right-click, Paste' but that doesn't activate the window.  I still need to left-click the window to activate it before I can type into it.\nIn Windows and Linux, the right-click to paste would also activate the window.  If I was pasting a command into a terminal, I could then just hit Enter to run it, whereas an extra mouse click is required on my Mac.  This feels a little cumbersome.\nCan this behaviour be adjusted to resemble Windows and Linux?\n\nA: The answer, in general, is \"no\". There are some exceptions/workarounds though, for example: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can click through to any control in an unfocused window using Cmd-Click. This will directly operate that control without focusing the window, which might save you a click in your side-by-side browser window scenario. Unfortunately it's up to each application developer to make this work sensibly, and some unfocused applications will still perform any special action assigned to Cmd-Click, rather than treating it as a simple click.\n\n*In Terminal.app, Cmd-Right Click will paste the contents of the primary selection (the last text you highlighted in any terminal window) into the same or another terminal, whether that terminal is focused or not.\n\n*Specifically for X11 applications running under XQuartz.app (which isn't very many these days), you can specify the \"focus follow mouse\" option so that X11 windows are focused as you mouse over them. (There also used be a hidden focus-follows-mouse option for Terminal.app windows, don't know if it still works in El Capitan or Sierra.)\n\n\nA: I know this is kind of an old thread but for anybody still looking, I found a great tool called yabai.\nHere is the GitHub link: https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai\nYou can set it up so focus-follows-mouse is the default system behavior and you will get what you're looking for. I was frustrated with this too, coming from Windows. However, I've been using this for the past 3 months and honestly I'd go crazy without it now. Highly recommend it.\nbrew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai\nbrew services start yabai\nyabai -m config focus_follows_mouse autofocus\n\nInstalling the yabai scripting addition or disabling system integrity protection was not necessary to make this work on an M1 mac.\n\nA: On Windows and Linux, quite everything which is relevant to a window, to its underlying application, is enclosed within the subject window. Prime example: the menu bar, which is in the window. On macOS, the active window finds its menu bar on top of the screen, not in the window (except a few old oddities), an active process could possibly impact or be acknowledged outside its representative window. \nThus I doubt the required switch is implemented in the user interface of MacOS or that it can be used in the underlying unix layer. I further doubt that implementing it would be feasible as long as the screen-top menu belongs to the active process. Just my 2c. \n", "Q: How does the Keychain identify executables? I am wondering how the Keychain identifies applications. I suspect that this based on code signing, but the experiments are not really consistent with this:\nIt works for executables that are not signed at all:\ncodesign -dv  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/R\n# /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/R: code object is not signed at all\n\nBut the R process is added to the ACL of this secret, and it can query it happily...\nThere is also nothing in the extended attributes of the executable:\nxattr -l  /usr/bin/security\n# \n\nIf I change the file itself, it still works:\ncp /usr/bin/security foobar\necho \"\\nharmless\" >> foobar\n./foobar find-generic-password -a 'gaborcsardi' -s foobar -g\n# keychain: \"/Users/gaborcsardi/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\"\n# class: \"genp\"\n# attributes:\n#     0x00000007 <blob>=\"foobar\"\n#     0x00000008 <blob>=<NULL>\n#     \"acct\"<blob>=\"gaborcsardi\"\n# ...\n# password: \"secret\"\n\nBut then how does it work? More specifically, how does the keychain know that the password query is coming from the security app, that I specifically allowed access to this entry?\n\nA: The Keychain doesn't identify applications, the applications call the Keychain API\n\nThe Keychain Services API provides a solution to this problem. By\n  making a single call to this API, an app can store small bits of\n  secret information on a keychain, from which the app can later\n  retrieve the information—also with a single call. The keychain secures\n  data by encrypting it before storing it in the file system, relieving\n  you of the need to implement complicated encryption algorithms. The\n  system also carefully controls access to stored items. The entire\n  keychain can be locked, meaning no one can decrypt its protected\n  contents until it is unlocked with a master password. Even with an\n  unlocked keychain, the system’s Keychain Access policy ensures that\n  only authorized apps gain access to a given item in the keychain. In\n  the simplest case, the app that created an item is the only one that\n  can access it later. However, Keychain Services also provides ways to\n  share secrets among apps.\n\n\n", "Q: Problem preparing '08 iMac for resale My wife owns an early 2008 iMac.  She is the third owner, having bought it from her brother, who bought it from a previous employer.  It had Yosemite on it when she bought it, but presumably it originally shipped with Leopard, judging by the OS X timeline.\nShe now wants to sell it so I am trying to prepare it for that, but I'm having difficulties reinstalling a pristine copy of OS X that isn't associated with her or my Apple ID, probably due to my ill-advised meddling with it.\nHere's what I did after she got it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded Yosemite to El Capitan\n\n*Realised that the Recovery partition would install a much older version, so thought it would be a good idea to update that as well, so:\n\n*Made an El Capitan USB installer using the official method, completely erased the hard disk (including the Recovery partition) and installed the system afresh from the USB.\n\n\nNow, when I attempt to use Internet Recovery, it runs the El Capitan installation, but prompts for my Apple ID before it will proceed.  This is not a satisfactory state to leave it in; we can't sell it to someone with the ability to use Internet Recovery dependant on knowing the previous owner's Apple ID.\nI suspect I need to downgrade the system (including the Recovery partition) to an older version of OS X that isn't linked to my Apple ID, maybe all the way back to Leopard.  Then, the new owner can upgrade it to El Capitan again using their own Apple ID.  However, the Leopard DVD originally shipped with the machine is long since lost.\nSo I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is attempting to downgrade back to an older version the right approach here?\n\n*How might I obtain an older version of OS X, preferably without needing to purchase it?\n\nA: You should install the latest compatible Mac OS release available for your iMac.\nIt is correct that you need an Apple ID to download a version of Mac OS using Internet Recovery.\nThe installation of Mac OS, however, will not be linked to your Apple ID if you just run the setup.\nAs soon as the new owner starts the machine and creates a user account Mac OS will ask him/her to create a new Apple ID or to use an existing one.\nPlease let me know if this helps.\n", "Q: Customise mailboxes shortcuts Is there a way to change the shortcuts to mailboxes?\nSince I don't care usually about VIPs/drafts (see attached fig.), it would be more helpful to have rather trash and archive, for instance.\n\n\nA: The shortcuts correspond to the order in which they appear on the Favourites Bar, underneath the toolbar.

However, if you want to use the same (now empty) device to upload your future photos to iCloud, you have to sync it with iPhoto again. The problem is, as soon as you sync it, not only will the future photos be uploaded to the cloud, but your old photos will get downloaded again to the device you emptied. Is there no way to automatically upload photos to iCloud without synching them?\n\nA: If you have iCloud Photo Library turned on on your device, it will sync all pictures on that library. You can use \"optimize storage\" if you need to free space on your device.\nIf you only want to have your new pictures on your phone and your whole library on iCloud, you need to transfer the pictures to Photos.app manually and then upload to iCloud from there.\n\nA: No.  iCloud is a syncing system, not an offline/cloud backup storage system.  \nIt's designed to allow you access to your files from any device logged-into that iCloud account.

You gained some unallocated disk space. \nTo reinstall Windows with Boot Camp Assistant you have to restore the ~vanilla Fusion Drive state. You can try to resize the whole Core Storage stack with the command with: diskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size. In your case that's: \ndiskutil cs resizeStack 9449131B-67F8-4D97-82D6-F2BDEDB48B6C 1022g\n\nIf you get an error \"... not enough space ...\" choose a slightly smaller size like 1021500m or 1021g.\nAfter poking around with Disk Utility or the Windows Disk Management tool (e.g. trying to remove/resize a Boot Camp partition with Disk Utility) the resizeStack command often fails with a cryptic -8xxxx error message because some internal CoreStorage structures are corrupted. Your OS X volume usually isn't affected though.\nThen you have to either backup the OS X partition with Time Machine, rebuild a vanilla Fusion Drive and finally restore the TM backup or install OS X from scratch after rebuilding a vanilla Fusion Drive.\nThen you can launch Boot Camp Assistant and install Windows 10 again.\n", "Q: My spacebar is broken, want help remapping it to my Option key I recently broke my space-key I've copied the space and I paste it to get the space when I'm typing. Can I get help mapping my key with Karabiner for Mac or any other key-mapping software?\n\nA: Using Karabiner is fairly simple if what you're trying to accomplish has a built-in remap option. You create a profile for the keyboard you want to remap (from the menu bar icon) and then open Karabiner’s Preferences page. From there go to the “Change Key” tab and select the remaps that you want to include.\nIf there are no built-in options to swap/remap the space bar to suit your preference (it's been a little while since I've had to use Karabiner so I can't remember the complete list of swaps) there is an extensive guide here which will show you how to create your own key-swap option by editing an .xml file:\nhttps://www.keychatter.com/2014/08/04/how-to-remap-keys-in-osx-using-keyremap4macbook-now-karabiner/ -- (Scroll down to the \"Advanced Remapping\" Section)\n(I included the link only as the full article steps are too long to post in a stackexchange answer)\n", "Q: Link aggregate \"bondmode\" spontaneously changes I've setup a link aggregate of the two ethernet ports on my macpro6,1 (via System Preferences > Network > Manage Virtual Interfaces > New Link Aggregate).\nDue to the way my other devices are setup, I need to set the \"bondmode\" of my device to \"static\":\n$ sudo ifconfig bond0 bondmode static\n\nThe problem so far is that, for no reason that I can discern and triggered by nothing I can identify in the logs, the bondmode reverts back to \"lacp\", and all of my connections drop.\nI can trigger this myself via networksetup -createbond xxx to create an extra (broken) bond. So perhaps changes to the network setup in general reset it to LACP?\nIs there something I can do to stop whatever process is causing the bondmode to change, or somehow achieve this another way? My end goal is to get some sort of round-robin style pattern for sending packets to spead a single connection across both ethernet cables to my server, as LACP results in all packets from a given connection going through a single link.\n\nA: I have not found a true solution, but I have created a band-aid at https://github.com/mikeboers/bondwatch.\nIt watches for the bond to report being up, but inactive, and then simply calls ifconfig $bondname bondmode static to reset it.\nI've been using it for nearly the full two weeks since I asked the question, and it has been working great.\n", "Q: Mac bash doesn't remember alias I'm trying to create a simpler alias to launch MIT-scheme from the Terminal so I did:\nalias mit-scheme=\"/Applications/MIT-Scheme.app/Contents/Resources/mit-scheme\"\n\nThen I can launch MIT-scheme by simply typing mit-scheme.\nHowever if I close this Terminal window and open a new one, when I type mit-scheme I get -bash: mit-scheme: command not found.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Running the command will define it for the current shell, but that's it. There's nothing specific about macOS here — this is a bash thing. You have to run the command on every shell.

If the MacBook is closed can it happen that the keyboard touch and scratch display?\nI don't mean anything to be put on the screen but something between display and key.\nIf you got a new MacBook there is some thin paper that cover your keyboard. I think it is there to \"defend\" display while transportation. Thats why is the question - do we need something like this if the notebook is transported for example in a bag?\n\nA: On old Powerbooks (the G4 specifically) the keyboard would sometimes leave an annoying permanent imprint on the screen. However, with any new Macbook, this is not an issue: the keys are now softer and further away from the screen, so they should never touch. \nIn my experience, trekking around with my rMBP, no protection is needed: I've traveled pretty roughly with the computer with no protection on and the screen is in perfect condition (even if I look closely). Just make sure no dust or other particles are on top of your keys because the added height may cause it to touch the screen. \nAs far as why Apple ships MBs with foam screen protectors, it is apparently to protect they screen during the roughness of shipping (where there is significantly more bounce for the keyboard and screen to deal with than you'll subject it to in your use of it); I think any damage is rare enough that you don't need to protect the screen, though Apple does want to ensure that every MB is opened upon delivery in perfect condition (thus the foam insert).\ntl:dr: Don't worry about it! You're much more likely to damage it by spilling liquid onto it, dropping it, or leaving it around pets.\nFor more, here's a forum discussion about your question.\n", "Q: What can I use to get dust off of my rMBP display? I've noticed that the Retina display on MacBook Pros gets scratches and dings very easily.  I just recently had to replace the display for a different reason, and I'd like to put on a tempered glass screen protector to prevent scratches and dings.  The problem is that I need to make sure that the screen is completely clean and dust-free before installing the screen protector, which I've found is very difficult to do.  I'm wondering if there are any products that I could buy to help get dust off of the screen?  Would something like an electronics brush or maybe even a camera lens brush work?  Please let me know!  Thanks.\n\nA: I recommend this $13 iKlear Screen Cleaning Bundle. \nIt cleans dust and grime off of any modern screen (including iPhones and Macbooks) really well and I've been using it happily for the past few years. It comes with a chamois cloth and some special spray that cleans off dust very well without harming the screen (or you—it doesn't irritate skin in my experience).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with iKlear in any way.\n", "Q: Can't format my Macbook, HDD and macUtilities won't load, \"blocked\" sign after trying to boot usb I just got my macbook white (2009) back again from fixing (batteries were swollen), and was trying to format it to OS El Capitan. \nI've been trying to do that all day, \n\n\n*\n\n*at first I tried with a bootable USB that I made on my on Mac (before formating for the first time). It didn't work, when I began the installation process - after formatting my MacOS drive, an error occurred. Ok, I was kind of expecting that. \n\n*the second time, I had already formated my HDD, so I made a bootable USB from my Windows 10 PC, using \"TransMac\". \n\n*I dind't work this time, and the next.\nThe error is: I plug the USB, Mac iniciates and while I'm pressing the \"Option\" key, it only shows the USB drive, and when I click on in to begin the install/format, the \"blocked\" sign appears and it stops there, on that loop.\n\n\nedit: \nThis is what happens when I turn on the computer holding the option key (with the USB plugged in):\n\n\n*\n\n*My MacOS drive doesn't appear, only the USB. \n\n*When I click on the USB, it begins to load (I couldn't load all images).\n\n*Then, when the bar loads, the \"blocked\" sign appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: First of all, like Allan mentioned in the comments, your MacOS drive will not show up on startup if you erased it. The reason the 'blocked' sign appears is because the installer files for OS El Capitan are corrupt on your USB.\nI also have a white MacBook from 2009 and I encountered the same issues when trying to install macOS Sierra from a bootable USB.\nHere's what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-create a bootable USB of OS X Yosemite using a Mac computer running MacOS. From my experience, third party applications like Install Disk Creator work better than the Terminal for fully loading the boot files. Note that the USB storage size must be larger than the file size of the installer for the OS you want to install. (8GB worked for me)\n\n*Run the bootable USB on your MacBook by using the steps you did before. This time, you should be able to get pass the 'blocked' sign.\n\n*Format the HDD using Disk Utility from the Utilities Menu. Click the 'Erase' tab and set the format of your HDD to 'OS X Extended (Journaled)', then click erase. Your MacBook should then be able recognise the HDD.\n\n*Install the OS X Yosemite on the HDD using the OS X Installer from the Utilities Menu. You can always update to El Capitan after you install Yosemite. You may have to configure the system time if you run into an error while validating the install.\n\n\nA: So you can boot from the USB drive, correct? If so, select the Disk Utility in the menubar and wipe your internal disk. Make sure to select \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" and \"GUID Partition Map\" as described here.\nIt is possible that your Mac is not compatible with OS X El Captian. Apparently you need at least an \"early 2009\" model. Did you check the System Requirements? If this is the case you can try some workarounds to get Sierra to run on your Mac.\n\nA: So when you see the 'blocked sign' (also known as the 'prohibitory sign', 'no entry sign' or 'circle with a line through it') what your Mac is telling you is that it cannot locate a drive with a bootable partition. What this means is that whatever drive the Mac was trying to boot to is either missing a critical boot file or it is damaged (and it either couldn't find another drive to try or it did but that one failed as well). Since you specifically selected the USB drive in an attempt to get it to boot, we know that it is in fact the drive it was trying to boot to. Long story short, your Mac is telling you that the \"Bootable USB Drive\" you created is not actually bootable.\nSome suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Complete an SMC Reset & a PRAM Reset and then try the bootable USB\ndrive again\n\n*If issue still occurs, try to re-create the bootable drive again using the resources you have as it may have experienced an issue/error that wasn't reported to you the first time; then attempt to use the 'new' bootable USB drive again (alternatively, you could try something other than TransMac in case it was the problem)\n\n*If it doesn't work, verify that the Mac still doesn't have a Recovery\nPartition option from the Boot disk selection screen (boot holding 'option' key). Unfortunately 99% of Macs from 2009 or earlier don't have the Internet Recovery option no matter which OS they've been upgraded to.\n\n\nIf you have the original install discs that came with your Mac (or a retail version of Snow Leopard), this is where I'd resort to them because my next recommendation can be a headache (or you may simply not have the resources handy). I know it means starting from either Leopard or Snow Leopard and then upgrading, but it would be the easiest and cleanest way to move forward.\nIf you don't have the original install disc or a retail copy of Snow Leopard, proceed.\nUse this section if your Macbook has a firewire port (Early or Mid 2009 model)\nIf you have access to another Mac you could attempt to put your empty Mac into target disk mode and reformat it using Disk Utility from the functioning Mac (booted normally, not to a Recovery mode). Then you could try to run the El Capitan installer right from there (after placing a copy of it into the /Applications folder), and select your Mac's internal drive as the install destination when prompted. You will need an App Store downloaded copy of the OS installer you're trying to install though, so if you don't have a functioning one you're going to need a solid internet connection to download one.\nApple article for Target Disk Mode: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22135?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US (You will need just a firewire cable if the second Mac has a firewire port; you will also need a Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter if that Mac is too new and does not have a firewire port and instead has a Thunderbolt port)\nSkip to this section if your Macbook does not have a firewire port (Late 2009 model)\nIf your Mac - for whatever reason - will not boot into Target Disk Mode, you could purchase (or borrow) and external drive enclosure, remove the hard drive from your Mac and install it into the drive enclosure, and then plug it in to a functioning Mac via usb. From there you would follow the same steps that I provided for Target Disk Mode - without booting into Target Disk Mode and instead just mounting the drive like a regular external HD - to format and reinstall.\n\nA: Your macbook 2009 (even early 2009) can handle El Capitan, but not Sierra.\nThe USB stick is not good. Make a new one on a working mac with ElCapitan.\n\nA: \"But, another worry that I have is: why my MacOS drive won't appear? \"\nBecause it is not bootable with an OS. You only see the bootable drives in the boot menu.\n\nA: Problem:  You have no bootable media.\n\n*\n\n*The USB installer didn't complete thus making it \"corrupt\" and non-bootable.  This is why you see the USB as a boot device, but then you get the prohibitory sign when you try to boot from it.  The USB has a boot partition and the boot files exist, but the files are corrupt.\n\n\n*The internal drive was wiped clean (formatted) rendering it blank and non-bootable as well.  This removed the boot partition and the files so since they can't be found, the drive doesn't show up as a boot option.\nHow to fix.\nYou need a working installer. Period.  No amount of resetting the SMC or NVRAM is going to make a non-bootable USB installer suddenly bootable.\nFirst off, let's confirm that El Capitan is compatible with your Mac.  Per Apple Support, it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\n\n\n\nThe next step is to create a new USB installer.  There are many excellent answers here on SE that already address this, so I won't belabor that point here. Take some time and read the answer to this question for details on how to do this.\nHow to obtain the El Capitan Installer.\nThis is the crux of the matter.  There are several ways to obtain the El Capitan Installer:\n\n*\n\n*Visit your local Apple Store.  They will assist you in downloading the installer for you.  In fact, they may already have the installer created and will install the OS for you while you wait. (This would obviously be the preferred method)\n\n\n*Download the installer from a friend with a Mac.  You can still download the El Capitan Installer.  If your friend downloaded it previously, it can be re-downloaded and installed.  This can be done by either creating a USB installer or connecting your Mac in \"Target Disk Mode\".  (For this, you will need a Firewire cable)\n\n\n*Purchase and install a Snow Leopard via Install Disk (available on eBay or the Apple Store).  Once you have SL installed, you can upgrade to El Capitan via the App Store\n\n\n*I am NOT going to recommend that you could download and create an the Snow Leopard disks via bittorrent and do the installation and upgrade that way because this would be outside the scope... If you must install via a PC, don't create the USB.  Burn an ISO (CD/DVD image) of SL and install that then upgrade to El Cap.\nLessons learned.\nFirst, before you erase your drive, make sure you have a working USB installer.  You can boot the installer without actually committing to installing the software.  You are just making sure it boots.  If it boots, it works.\nSecondly...allow your installation of whatever you are doing (like creating the USB installer to finish).  98% is not 100% no matter how close it seems.\nFinally....this has been said countless times:  Backup. Backup your backup.  Time Machine is your friend.\n", "Q: iPhone Not Showing Notification Content in Banner This seems like a privacy setting, or some sort of notification setting, but I can't seem to find any option to reenable this functionality.\nCurrent settings:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/0rKSn\nIssue at hand:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/nXfav\nIf it helps, I was on the iOS 10.2.1 beta before downgrading back to 10.2.

When I plug into iTunes, it does not even show my backup from the \"Restore Backup\" option.\nWhile I would prefer to have the full backup, the firmware is the most important to me.

You can restore a backup from an older version to a newer version of iOS. \nBest case, you export the data to a computer or online service and find a way to jailbreak or buy a device with the older OS.

My question is not about \"should I do it or not?\"\nIs there any solutions to cover camera and microphone? Some people use tapes.\nIt will be interesting to have something that will not damage this parts and that could easy be \"uninstalled\" :) \n\nA: For the camera:\nYou could try a small, completely opaque vinyl decal (or just a piece of one cut to the appropriate size, like those window decorations some people use that cling to glass without leaving a residue). I believe most of them adhere using a combination of static cling and a tacky (but not sticky) surface.\nFor the microphone:\nAs for the microphone, I don't know of anything that adheres to the brushed aluminum surface of a Mac that doesn't act like a sticker or tape, which may leave a residue behind. Magnets are a bad idea because they can damage internal components over time, like the speakers. Simply covering the microphone isn't a good option though because of how/where Apple installs the microphones in Macs. Sounds can still get through, although it would be muffled. \nInstead, it's been suggested that buying a TRRS 'dummy jack' and inserting it into the headphone port is more effective because it mutes the built-in microphone until you unplug it. I personally haven't been able to locate these 'dummy jacks' that people speak of, but instead a headphone splitter with Mic support should do the trick and doesn't have to be too costly.\nIf you can't find a TRRS 'dummy jack' (one that has the mic support) or a headphone/microphone splitter you could try purchasing a pair of cheap headphones that have a built-in Mic (maybe even from the dollar store?) and cut off the cord, leaving just the little end that plugs into the headphone port. Note: I have not tried the cut-off headphones trick myself, so I can't guarantee that it will work with Macs.\nYou also need to remember that if you do use one of these methods that while the Mac's audio jack/port is occupied your internal speakers will not function, as they've been switched off. This means that to listen to music or watch videos using the internal speakers you will need to remove the splitter or dummy jack.\nThe headphone splitters with microphone support look like this:\n\n\nYou'll notice that the little end has 3 rings on it - not only two - the 3rd being for microphone support.\n\nA: For the camera, a sticky note works perfectly as it does not leave any residue.  As far as the microphone goes, @NYKg's solution will work quite well if you don't mind something hanging out of your headphone jack.\n\nA: the best hack I've found- a magnate for the camera. It does no sticky damage\n\nA: For the microphone: perhaps a small magnet?\nEdit: the best I can get my laptop mic to do is be muffled a bit from holding a magnet on it, and the magnet won't stick by itself\n", "Q: MacOS Server DHCP lease duration change Running MacOS Server 5.2 on El Capitan.

This the Finder stylizes as \"iCloud Drive\" and only has folders for certain applications.\nIt is still possible to access Mobile Documents proper through Terminal, but even when opening the directory in Finder directly from Terminal it redirects to com~apple~CloudDocs.\nIs it possible to access the root Mobile Documents folder from Finder?\n\nA: I found a really nice type of workaround for this from here. Essentially you need to run the following command in Terminal:\nln -s ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/ ~/Desktop/Real\\ iCloud\\ Drive\n\nThis will create an alias on your desktop that shows all the folders in the Mobile Documents folder when you open it. You are free to browse it to your liking—albeit with one caveat: you can't directly open any folders. You'll have to use the list view's ability to expand folders and then view files from there. \n\nA: No - you'll need an alternative GUI program to see that folder. \nFinder is hard coded to not show you that folder no matter how you try to navigate there.\n\nA: I am using macOS 13.2. Finder does not show me all directories in the iCloud Drive folder, even if one creates a symbolic link as described in the accepted answer (ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/ ~/Desktop/Real\\ iCloud\\ Drive).\nTo see all folders, use terminal to navigate to that directory:\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/\n\nThen use\nls -al \n\nto view the content.\n\nA: Open Terminal and enter the following: \ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\nHold the ‘Option/alt’ key, then right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch.\nMobile Documents will now show all the hidden files, including iCloud.\n", "Q: Default font size on the status bar What is the default font and size of the font on the status bar on El Capitan and Sierra?\nMy guess is: San Francisco size 14?\n\nA: I'd guess at 11pt, SanFransisco.\nStandard list views are 12pt, the headers are smaller, but not small enough to be 10.\nYou can test by eye...\nOpen any finder window\nHit  Cmd ⌘   J \nChange the text size until it appears to match the status bar.\nZooming the screen might help comparison [ Opt ⌥  + scroll wheel by default]\nThis is a quick attempt at matching, artificially zoomed in Photoshop...\n\n", "Q: iPhone 7 never shows \"LTE\" even on LTE network I have an iPhone 7 which I bought directly from Apple, and my SIM contract is with Three here in the UK. I have been using this phone happily since September, I had noticed the mobile data connection flips between 3G and 4G which I thought little of at first. I figured 3G = HSPA/+ and 4G = LTE.\nHowever, the other week I was with a friend in the US who had recently got a 7 plus. She is with AT&T and I noticed that her phone was most often displaying LTE as the connection type. I thought this was odd as I had never seen this on my own iPhone 7 and had presumed that 4G meant LTE. I did a little googling and found some discussions which claimed that on iOS the 4G mean HSPA+ and 3G means regular old 3G. In this case I was double confused as my carrier, Three, supposedly has a 4G LTE network and so I should see LTE from time to time.\nI understand that Three does not have an LTE-Advanced network, only regular LTE. So is this perhaps the distinction and confusion? 4G = LTE and LTE = LTE-Advanced?\nCould somebody perhaps clear up what is going on? Do I need to contact my carrier to change the network connection settings on my phone? If I can make use of the iPhone 7's faster mobile data tech then I would like to as I am a very heavy data user. The reason I went with Three was for their unlimited data tariff.\nEDIT:\nAs requested by owlswipe. A photo showing Speedtest saying the network is \"Three  LTE\" with the network icon at the top left saying \"4G\" which it did throughout the test. I am on 40th floor of a tower here so speeds aren't fantastic...\n\n\nA: Most carriers support LTE on just about any modern smartphone, including iPhones going back to the iPhone 5. Indeed, Three rolled out LTE back in 2014.\nYour friend is correct that 4G (HSPA+) is not the same as LTE. In general, LTE has shorter range but enables significantly faster data speeds than plain old 4G (hence its name, Long Term Evolution).\nTo enable LTE, go to Settings -> Cellular Data Options -> Enable LTE and choose either Data Only or Voice and Data. \n\nMore information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually Enabling LTE on iPhone (cult of mac)\n\n*Difference Between 4G and LTE (nyt gadgetwise)\n\n*Picture Evidence of 3 LTE (three support)\n\n\n\nEdit: Based on OP's evidence, it seems that on 3 UK, LTE is referred to as 4G, so indeed the status bar will never show \"LTE\", just \"4G\", even while on a 4G-LTE network. As long as the speeds hold up to LTE-quality, you're probably getting LTE. This is likely a regional difference, determined by the language on your phone.\n", "Q: Tell git not to use my GitHub account (Keychain) for public repositories - it's a privacy issue Whenever some script or Git clones/pulls something from GitHub I don't wish to send my GitHub Account, if the repo is public.\nHow to make sure I won't be authenticated with my GitHub user with Keychain?\n> brew search geoip\ngeoip                                                                                                                                geoipupdate\nError: GitHub\nThe GitHub credentials in the macOS keychain may be invalid.\nClear them with:\n  printf \"protocol=https\\nhost=github.com\\n\" | git credential-osxkeychain erase\nOr create a personal access token:\n  https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=gist,public_repo&description=Homebrew\nand then set the token as: export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=\"your_new_token\"\n\n> git credential-osxkeychain erase\nhost=github.com\nprotocol=https\n\n\nA: Add the variable HOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API to your environment.\nFor example add this to your .bash_profile to turn off \"once for all\":\nexport HOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API=1\n\nor put it in front of the brew for single actions:\nHOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API=1 brew search geoip\n\n", "Q: Homebrew installed: geoiplookup shows no output - howto install GeoIP-data? > geoipupdate; geoiplookup 8.8.4.4\n> echo $?\n0\n\nIt does not print any output.

I am using a DVI -> Thunderbolt(Mini DisplayPort) cable. (I tried HDMI<->HDMI as well).\n\nA: The MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) has an Intel Iris 5100 GPU and is capable of supporting an HDMI-compatible device, including 4K, while using one Thunderbolt display or it can support two Thunderbolt displays.\nIn terms of external resolution, this model supports up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096 x 2160 pixels at 24Hz (using HDMI) or up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 30Hz (using Thunderbolt). \nAccording to the specs of the Acer R241Y, this has a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 60Hz. And, according to the user manual, this resolution is achieved using VESA mode.\nPossible solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*On your MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*REFRESH RATE - As a first step, I would check the Refresh Rate set in your MBP. You can find this under the Display tab within System Preferences > Displays. If you change it, you may need to wait a couple of minutes to ensure the change has taken effect properly.\n\n*RESOLUTION - I would also double-check you're not using the Scaled option for your resolution. Instead, make sure you have the Best for display option selected - also found in System Preferences > Displays.\n\n*RESET NVRAM - It may be worth resetting your NVRAM. If you're unsure how to do this, refer to my answer here. Make sure you look under the PRAM/NVRAM heading.\n\n\n\nNOTE: If, at any point, the display switches off after configuring options in your Displays System Preference, just press the Esc key to undo the last change.\n\n\n*On your Acer R241Y display:\n\n\nIf you're still having issues after checking/trying each of the above, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mode type -  If your display is already in Auto mode, manually try each of the others (e.g. Standard mode, Graphic mode, etc) one by one. If it's already on a specific mode, then try it in Auto mode instead.\n\n*Focus - You can also manually configure the display's focus. You should be able to do this by going to the Picture Menu.\n\n*Reset your display - There should also be a Reset option on your display's menu. It may be worth trying this if all else fails.\n\n\n[EDIT]\nSince your issue is around how fonts look, there is also a setting in your System Preferences > General. Maybe try ticking/unticking the Use LCD font smoothing when available option to see what difference that makes.\n\nA: I was experiencing a similar issue on an LG external monitor and just figured it out.  \nLG has a setting called SuperResolution+ which essentially is a sharpness filter and makes movies and pictures look better but makes text look horrible.\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/ces-lg-tackles-upscaling-with-super-resolution/\nSwitching off the sharpness filter makes my text appear perfectly.\nI wonder if there is a similar feature on your monitor but in any case this answer might be useful for someone who has this issue with LG.\n\nA: There is a fix, after all the research I did, here is how you can fix it:\nThere is something called HIDPI which is required in order for mac to display a decent font on other displays.\nInstall SwitchResX here https://www.madrau.com/ and then take your mac to recovery mode by Restarting and holding command+R. Then open the Terminal in the recovery mode(from the top bar navigation) and type in 'csrutil disable' and later 'csrutil enable' when you want to reenable it. Now after you disabled it, restart your computer and open SwitchResx:\n1- If you find the resolution of the monitor in the resolution list with the mark HIDPI then you just click and you are done!\n2- If not go into the custom resolution, select from the scaled resolutions\n3- create a resolution of your monitor but put double amount for each side pixels. Ex. If your monitor is 1920 by 1080, do 3840 by 2160. Save it and then restart the computer\n4- Go back to the list of resolutions and your created resolution should be there.. Look for 1920x1080 with HIDPI mark.\nYou can go back to recovery mode then to reenable the security.\nBOOM!\n\nA: I have been having this issue on/off with an LG UM95...34 something. It's a 34 inch 3440x1440 21:9 ultra wide. Anyway, it was fine for ages and then recently went back to being what I would call... over-sharpened. It's painful to look at close up.\nThe last thing suggested here (reset monitor settings on the actual monitor) seemed the least effort so I tried that first et voi la! It's back to its normal smooth self. Recommend trying that first.\n", "Q: MacBook Air freezes and then won't start up (interrogation folder) So I own a MacBook air Air 13 11\" which worked fine for about 15 months after I purchased it on Adorama.\nOne day, I was using it and it froze.

I was looking at movies reviews online, and a hyper link took me to iTunes, it said \"Hey this isn't available in the US but it is in the UK, would you like to change stores?\"  So I said sure, why not?  Now I'm stuck in the UK store.  I tried Settings -> iTunes & App Stores -> Apple ID -> View Apple ID -> Country/Region, but it doesn't work because of active subscriptions and passes (which I do have under the US store).  How do I get back the US store front for my iTunes Store on my iPhone?\n\nA: Quit the iTunes Store and the App Store on your iPhone. Then go to 'Settings > iTunes > iTunes & App Store' and sign out of your Apple ID, and then back in. When you relaunch the iTunes Store app it should then automatically direct you to the iTunes Store for the appropriate country.\n", "Q: Most effective way to backup contacts from iPhone to plain .csv - format I got a corrupted iPhone 5 with latest iOS 10.2\nBefore I will start over from scratch I would like to backup all my contacts and notes.\nI would prefer to store them to .csv format, because they are corrupted. The plain text format re-usable in Excel offers me the most possibilities in unifying my contacts from different sources and to correct them if necessary.\nFor the notes backup .txt would be most appropriate to me.\nWhich trustable tool should I use, preferably free, but if not available I would pay for it.\n\nA: If your contacts are stored in iCloud, use this method: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iCloud.com and log in with your Apple ID\n\n*Click the Contacts web app\n\n*Highlight all contacts (click the first contact entry, scroll to the\nbottom of your list, hold the 'shift' key and click the last contact\nentry)\n\n*Click the 'Settings' icon in the bottom left hand corner of the page\n\n*Select 'Export vCard'\n\n\nThe vCard should now be in your '~/Downloads' folder (if you haven't changed the filepath for new downloads from your web browser settings)\nIf you own a Mac (and it appears all of the contacts from your iPhone are also accounted for on your Mac) use this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Contacts application\n\n*Highlight/click a contact\n\n*Select all ('Edit > Select All' or press 'command + A'\n\n*Click 'File > Export vCard' and save it somewhere safe\n\n\nNow you will just need to find a conversion tool to convert the vCard (*.vcf file) to a *.csv file. There are many free online options such as this one but I cannot attest to whether or not the online tools are secure (as in, I don't know if they store your file on their servers somewhere after the conversion process and if they can access the information for your contacts). \nA safer option would to go with an actual application that doesn't send the information to any website servers to convert it. If you have a Mac I found one on the App Store that looks promising called vCard Editor for $5.49CAD but I personally have never used it to know how well it works.\nAs for backing up the Notes, you're not going to like the answer. Just remember - don't shoot the messenger!\nThere isn't a way to backup all of your Notes at once from an iPhone or iCloud.com. (What was Apple thinking?!) The 'Apple approved' method of backing up your Notes is to either email or text (SMS) each individual Note to yourself from your device. Yes, I'm being serious. This is even the method they walk you through if you call Apple Support for assistance.\nFortunately if you have a Mac and all of your iPhone notes appear to be accounted for on your Mac as well, there is a work around (although it will not be in *.txt format). On your Mac you can copy the '~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/' folder to someplace safe in case you ever want/need to restore all of your notes at once. \nNote: The copy/backup of that folder that you make doesn't update as you add new notes or delete some, so if you ever do need to restore that file you need to copy/backup all of your new notes first otherwise they'll get 'over-written' (for lack of better terms) upon restoration of that folder.\n", "Q: How to debug AppleScript error: \"Expected “*)” but found end of script.\" I am going mad trying to fix the following error in my AppleScript code:\n\nWhat this error means is that I have opened a comment somewhere in the code with a (* but I have forgot to close it with a *).\nThe code contains over 4000 lines and hundreds of comments. I have looked through the code for hours trying to find this missing closure but I cannot find it.\nIs there some method or application that can inform me of the exact line of the code that is responsible for the error?\n\nA: There's a syntax highlighting package for AppleScript for the text editor Atom. It works better than the one provided with Script Editor, as it will correctly identify multiline comments, even if the script itself doesn't compile:\n\nFrom there, it should be easy to identify the missing *).\n\nA: Update:\nThe reason why I could not find an instance of a (* without a corresponding *) is because every instance of (* does in fact have a corresponding *). This wasn't the cause of the error, despite the misleading error message that claimed that it was.\nThe following comment was responsible for the error:\n    (*  \n        \"This is the text that I want to display            \n    *)\n\nYou cannot put an odd number of double quotation marks in an AppleScript comment, apparently. That is to say, if you open a quote, you must close the quote.\nI have no idea why this is. It's a comment, for Pete's sake. Why does AppleScript care if I forget to close a double quotation mark in a comment?\nAlso, this requirement is not mentioned in the AppleScript Language Guide - Comments.\nIf you are curious, I just tested it, and you are allowed to put a single quotation mark in a comment without closing it. For example,\n(* 'This is the text that I want to display *)\nproduces no error.\n\nAnyway, to answer my original question:\n\nIs there some method or application that can inform me of the exact line of the code that is responsible for the error?\n\nI managed to think of a method heuristically. It's crazy basic, and to many people it is probably obvious, but it never occurred to me as I was reading line after line for hours, looking for the missing *).\nUsing the following method, I found the exact line of code responsible for the error in under 5 minutes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new, blank AppleScript file.\n\n*Copy one half of your code to the new file.\n\n\n*\n\n*If this code produces an error, then delete one half of this code. Compile the code.\n\n\n*\n\n*If this code still produces an error, then delete one half of this code. Compile the code.\n\n*If this code no longer produces an error, then hit the Undo button and delete the other half of the code. Compile the code.\n\n\n*If this code does not produce an error, then hit the Undo button. This time, copy the other half of the original code (that is, copy the half that you did not copy the first time).\nYou get the idea. You are basically halving the code (by trial and error) until you can isolate the error down to a single line of code. There must be a technical term for this method, but I don't know the term.\n", "Q: Shortcut to open/close sidebar in Notes app? In Safari, you can press  Cmd ⌘  ⇧  L  to open/close the sidebar.

This is a feature built in to Macbooks that allows you to use them like desktop computers, with the lid closed and using a monitor as your only screen.\nYou'll need:\n\n*\n\n*An AC power adapter (like this one)\n\n*An external keyboard and mouse or trackpad, either USB or wireless (like this keyboard and this trackpad)\n\n*An external display or projector (like this one)\n\n*(Optional) A dock for your MBP (like this one)\n\nTo put your MBP into Closed Clamshell Mode:\n\n*\n\n*Connect your keyboard and mouse/trackpad to the computer\n\n*Plug the computer into power\n\n*Connect it via HDMI or Thunderbolt to the external monitor\n\n*Close the lid\n\n*OR place a weak magnet next to your trackpad (the sensor for closed lid detection is there & magnetic) for better cooling (I use an old iPad case)\n\nOnce in Closed Clamshell Mode, the Macbook's screen will turn off and it will still be outputting picture to the monitor. Read more on Apple's support page.\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\nUsing the built-in keyboard and trackpad\nYou can dim your Macbook's screen all the way down (just press brightness down repeatedly) and then connect the Macbook to your monitor with HDMI. Your screen will be off but the keyboard and trackpad built into the Macbook will still be on and available. Optionally, you can download the free app Amphetamine to keep your Mac from sleeping.\n\n", "Q: Are these two optical drives interchangeable? I have two laptops:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook 2,1\n\n*MacBook Pro 5,3\n\n\nAs the optical drive of the MBP has issues, I would like to use the optical drive from the MB.\nThe MB optical drive has an ATA interface, while the MBP drive uses SATA. Googling I find that these interfaces are not interchangeable. \nHowever, both use the ATAPI protocol, so this made me doubt my earlier conclusion.\nThis is the information of the MB optical drive:\n\nThis is the information of the MBP optical drive:\n\nWill I be able to swap-out the UJ-868 (MBP) drive with the GSA-S10N (MB) drive?\n\nA: They are not interchangeable.\nATA is also referred to as PATA (Parallel ATtachment or IDE). SATA is is Serial ATA or Serial Attachment.  ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) is just the drive communication protocol used to \"talk\" to the drives.\nUsing the \"larger\" drives as a visual reference since the micro connectors' size in a laptop can be deceiving, we can see the huge difference between a PATA connector and the SATA connector.\n\n\nEven though they use the same protocol, the two are completely different.  A protocol is how devices communicate (what runs over the cable).  \nLet's use a more common interface, electricity, as an analogy.  Even though the exact same thing (electric current) runs through these devices, they are no way \"compatible.\"  The first picture is a US 220V appliance outlet and the second is a common PC electrical plug.  If you were to get one connected to the other, it most definitely wouldn't work (ever again).\n\n\n", "Q: Receiving \"USB devices disabled: Unplug the device using too much power\" upon login. Built-in keyboard and trackpad sometimes become unresponsive Hardware\nMacbook Air 13\" mid-2013 (running macOS Sierra) with no USB devices plugged in (except a Logitech wireless mouse that I never have plugged in while the laptop boots up).\nProblem\n\n\n*\n\n*I receive the message USB devices disabled: unplug the device using too much power once upon startup or logging in even when nothing's plugged into the USB ports.\n\n*The built-in keyboard and trackpad sometimes stop working. I suspect a logic board failure of some sort (but I'm no expert on hardware). However, they are always working upon starting up the machine, but only fail occasionally once I'm logged in to my user account.\n\n\nThese issues only started after recently recovering from a water spill (so that may have something to do with it). The laptop was dried with a fan for 5 days and works well still otherwise.\nHere is one of the messages Console gives me:\n\ndefault   08:11:00.752541 -0500   kernel  000790.147865 HS02@14200000: AppleUSBHostPort::interruptOccurred: **overcurrent detected with port status 0x4000**, localSimulatedInterrupts = 0x0\n\nHow I've tried to fix it\n\n\n*\n\n*I have taken it to the nearest Apple Store and had a Genius Bar employee run diagnostics. They told me that there were no apparent hardware issues, and that I would have to send the Macbook to a repair factory if the issues persist.\n\n*After cleaning the PCB with Q-tips and rubbing alcohol to remove any visible residue/dust, the keyboard/trackpad issues do not occur as often. However, they still happen once in a while.\n\n*I have also reset the SMC and NVRAM multiple times to no avail. I also deleted my Preferences.plist file as a friend suggested a corrupt Preferences.plist file can cause issues with the keyboard and trackpad.\nQuestion\nWhat can I try to fix my issues? I think these issues are probably a result of the water damage, but repairs can go up to $750 USD (so I was told) and the Genius Bar employee could not tell me what specifically was wrong with my Macbook. I would like some more info before I go and dump another few hundred dollars onto this thing, because if I have to pay $750, it may be more worth it to go and buy a new laptop instead.\nTL;DR by @owlswipe\nMy Macbook's trackpad and keyboard spontaneously stop/start working after some water damage, and the USB ports spontaneously shut off too. What's the cheapest way to get this thing back into working order?\nAlso\nThis is what happens upon logging back in after a restart:\n\n\nA: If there has been water damage that will have dried by now so the likelihood of water sloshing around causing this issue is near 0, however it may have caused corrosion to the trackpad, keyboard or main logic board.\nYou need to get Apple, or an Apple Authorised Service Provider to repair it. Alternatively you could seek third party service, or do the repair yourself.\nThe USB Over Current warning is associated primarily with the positive and negative rails having been short circuited (connected) causing more current than the allowed to flow, the USB chip puts that port into a disabled state to protect the computer from damage, this could be the result of corrosion inside creating particles that are shorting a component, or it could be that one of the connectors or wires has become corroded and has increased the resistance of that wire again causing a higher current draw and triggering the protective mode.\nSelf repair\nIf you decide to repair the computer yourself, you need to think about where the water was spilled, and how much, if it was only a small amount on the keyboard that could suggest that only keyboard replacement is necessary.\nAnyway, first step is to backup data, and find a suitable take apart guide from a site such as iFixit, following these guides you can open the machine and look for signs of liquid damage on the keyboard, trackpad and main logic board.\nOnce you've identified where the liquid has damaged you can proceed to replace these components.\n", "Q: Can the data on an MacBook Pro SSD be recovered after formatting using Disk Utility My MacBook Pro is going to a new owner and I want to be certain the data is adequately erased on the internal SSD (PCIe flash). There are two Stack Exchange questions/answers that appear to present conflicting facts about whether or not using Disk Utility to erase a partition will make it sufficiently difficult enough to prevent data recovery:\nSuggests that a simple \"Erase\" in Disk Utility will do the job:\nHow to get the \"securely erase\" function of Disk Utility on El Capitan & Sierra\nSuggests that an SSD that has been erased can be reasonably recovered:\nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12503/can-wiped-ssd-data-be-recovered\nSo based on this conflicting information, how can I be reasonably sure that the data on the erased SSD is gone and none-recoverable? Is it true that when you format a drive on a MacBook Pro (late 2016) that the TRIM function will erase all remnants of the files or are they still on the drive, ready for someone with a recovery program to access them?\nI am tempted to try the diskutil secureErase but I don't want to accedentiallly erase the wrong disk/partition nor put unnecessary wear on the SSD.\n\nA: Since I was the author of the answer linked, I'll have a go at explaining what's going on....\nFirst off, it's important to note that the study FAST referenced from the SE Information Security community,  Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives is from 2011 and now 6 years old1.   \nThe conference where this paper was presented was in Feb of 2011.  Keep in mind that the SATA 3.1 spec which addressed the TRIM issues wasn't released until July of 2011\nWithin the TRIM specification, included in SATA 3.1, \n\nA drawback of the original ATA TRIM command is that it was defined as\n  a non-queueable command and therefore could not easily be mixed with a\n  normal workload of queued read and write operations. SATA 3.1\n  introduced a queued TRIM command to remedy this.[62]\nThere are different types of TRIM defined by SATA Words 69 and 169\n  returned from an ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE command:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Non-deterministic TRIM: Each read command to the Logical block address\n  (LBA) after a TRIM may return different data. \n  \n*Deterministic TRIM\n  (DRAT): All read commands to the LBA after a TRIM shall return the\n  same data, or become determinate. \n  \n*Deterministic Read Zero after TRIM\n  (RZAT): All read commands to the LBA after a TRIM shall return zero.\n  \n\nWhat all of this comes down to is which type of TRIM command your hardware is capable of executing.  From the research I have done thus far, modern SSD's use either DRAT or RZAT depending on the \"quality\" of the drive (higher quality generally meaning RZAT is implemented).\nIn drives that implement DRAT, the deleted space is marked \"unused\" the data \"can\" be recovered, to a point.  With drives that use RZAT, once the TRIM command is executed, the drive will return \"zeros\" regardless of whatever data is in that space.2\nThe 2016 MBP uses the SanDisk SDRQKBDC4 064G 64 GB3 NAND which is OEM'd specifically for Apple.  Unfortunately, I haven't found detailed specs on concerning TRIM support for these particular drives (the White Paper they reference is 404).  While I can't get my hands on any detailed tech specs of this drive, I would wager that it uses the RZAT TRIM command and not DRAT.\nLong story short, if the SSD has only DRAT capability, there is the possibility of recovering data, but it's usually in a situation where you were able to stop the deletion process and immediately start  data recovery.  If it implement RZAT, you can be pretty sure the recovery will only get zeros back unless they take it (along with a court order) back to the manufacturer to get a low level recovery. 2\nTL;DR\nWith new and modern Macs and macOS, if you wipe your drive and reinstall macOS on top of it it is highly unlikely that someone will be able to recover your files.  \nIf you are concerned that the user will take the drive to a forensics lab to recover data, (that's a whole different issue), you should replace the drive.  Anything less than that and you will be fine.\n\n1 USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies, 2011.\n2 Recovering Evidence from SSD Drives in 2014: Understanding TRIM, Garbage Collection and Exclusions.  Sept. 23, 2014\n3 MacBook Pro 13\" Touch Bar Teardown  Ifixit.com, ~December 2016.\n\nA: The latter answer you cite has all the info. It is tricky to erase an SSD. So it depends on your security needs. \nAs the first article says, deleting files while using TRIM does a decent job of destroying data but there is a chance that some data might me recoverable. \nFor more security, you can either encrypt your disk with Filevault or wipe it. The result should be pretty much the same (wear and security wise). But as the latter answer says\nthere is no 100% guarantee that some bits are recoverable. \nEspecially in the second case it would be pretty difficult for an attacker to reconstruct the data and some commercial undelete tool would probably not be sufficient to do so. \n", "Q: How does “Optimize Mac Storage” for iCloud Drive interact with Spotlight and Time Machine? How does the option “Optimize Mac Storage” for iCloud Drive interact with Spotlight and Time Machine?\nAs far as I understand, the option causes macOS to remove your Mac’s copy of old iCloud Drive files. In iCloud Drive in the Finder, those files are then shown with a download icon. But I don’t understand what happens to those files in Spotlight and Time Machine.\nCan you still search the contents of those files in Spotlight? What happens to those files in Time Machine backups? I assume existing backups will still have the local copy, but what about new backups?\nAlso, what happens if you edit those files on an iPad? Will the files be automatically downloaded again to the Mac? If not, can you search the new contents of those files in Spotlight? Will new Time Machine backups have a local copy with the new contents, the old contents or no local copy at all?\n\nA: \nCan you still search the contents of those files in Spotlight?\n\nYes, for a while. Spotlight doesn't purge the files from the index (./Spotlight-V100), however it doesn't particularly ensure they remain.\nTherefore, when macOS stores a file in iCloud and removes it from your home folder, the Spotlight index retains an index of the contents, but doesn't actively refresh the index. For example, resetting your Spotlight index will remove the file contents from the index. To add the files back, download them from iCloud, at which point Spotlight will index them once again.\n\nWhat happens to those files in Time Machine backups?\n\nTime Machine does not back up files in iCloud. They are ‘presumed safe’ in the cloud. They will remain on any older backups, but new incremental backups will observe the files as having been deleted.\nIf you restore a Time Machine backup on to a new Mac, you will log in to iCloud as part of the Setup Assistant, at which point the files will be accessible once again as normal.\n\nAlso, what happens if you edit those files on an iPad? Will the files be automatically downloaded again to the Mac?\n\nOptimize Mac Storage attempts to keep your recent files available on your Mac. Therefore, when a file is edited by any device, your Mac will download the file locally, in case you want to continue editing there.\n\nIf not, can you search the new contents of those files in Spotlight?\n\nSince the files are downloaded on editing, the new contents will be made available in the Spotlight index when the index is updated.\n\nWill new Time Machine backups have a local copy with the new contents, the old contents or no local copy at all?\n\nIf a backup takes place whilst the file is downloaded, the new contents will be backed up. If the file is only in the cloud when Time Machine performs a backup, the file will not be backed up.\n\nA: \nHow does the option “Optimize Mac Storage” for iCloud Drive interact with Spotlight?\n\nSpotlight shows files on iCloud.\n\n\nA: For the name and kind of the file, it will show up in Spotlight. As for the contents, it seems like it is working with regular iCloud storage, but I couldn't find any information if it works with Optimised Storage. My guess is that it does work since macOS only moves the file and doesn't change the properties to not be included. It would be logical for the contents to be searchable, but I am only 99% sure. The best way to find out is in my opinion, to try it yourself and see if it works.\nIf you were to back up with Time Machine, it should include a \"symlink\" to the file but you will still probably need to sign in with your Apple ID to gain access to it.\n", "Q: How to stop iPhone users from unintentionally sending texts to my email address I use an Android phone but many of my friends and family have iPhones.  Starting a few months ago I discovered that several people sent me text messages that didn't go through.  And after digging into the problem, I discovered that their messages appeared as blue on their phone, not green, indicating that iMessage didn't convert it to a standard text. Then I discovered that (at least for some of the people), their texts were being sent to my email, not my phone number.  The weird thing is that I don't even think some of these people had my email.\nI do have an iCloud account because I own a Mac, and somebody has indicated that can lead messages to your email address.  But I'm not sure.  How can I, once and for all, deregister my email (not my phone number, that's already been asked) from receiving iMessages and have my friends' Messages apps only suggest my phone number as a destination to text me at?\ntl;dr: My email is registered as an iMessage destination, but I need to deregister it so my iPhone-using friends only send SMSs to my phone number.\nJust to be clear: This post is not a duplicate of asking how to deregister your phone number from iMessage.  I never had an iPhone when iMessage existed and when I try using the deregister iMessage page it just says my phone number is not registered with iMessage.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the messages app on your Mac.\n\n*Open preferences from the Messages menu at the top of the screen.\n\n*Select the Accounts tab of the preferences window.\n\n*Uncheck enable this account\nIn future iPhone users should not find that messaging you defaults to an iMessages and rather to a SMS message.\nThe following video demonstrates these steps:\nhttps://youtu.be/C5ilqv8NruE\nThis is a particularly nasty ongoing bug which does not rely on ever having had a iPhone and is particularly difficult to detect because the sender thinks they have sent you a text message(s) and the (non-)receiver is none-the-wiser that they are missing any messages/ignoring someone.\n\nA: Once you’ve deregistered your SMS in Apple’s system, there’s no way to stop people from contacting you via SMS or email.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/\nIt’s the same as if you wanted to stop spam / unwanted SMS messages - you can ask the person sending to block and you can contact your carrier to ask how you can control spoofed / spam messages. In the end, you are paying that carrier to let other people contact you and have to work with them to get assistance blocking or changing your number.\nIt’s also the same as if you have spam email. You can ask the sender to stop or you can work with your mail delivery service.\nNote - unsubscribe and spam block rules are hard and ineffective when the sender doesn’t respond and just hits every possible number or address. In your case, if it’s friends or aquaintances, you’ll likely be able to ask nicely and fix that.\n\nA: I'm on a newer version of macOS (Big Sur) that doesn't have the \"enable this account\" option available to uncheck in iMessage. Here's how I got around this issue:\n\n*\n\n*Apple menu > System Preferences > Apple ID > Name, Phone, Email\n\n*Add a new email to the \"Reachable At\" field. You can add a junk email address, or just add some . or + to your regular email address, iMessage will still consider it different. Follow the steps in the verification email to verify it.\n\n*Close System Preferences, and a prompt will pop up asking \"Do you want to add [new email] to iMessage and FaceTime?\" click \"Yes\".\n\n*Open the Messages app, then open preferences from the Messages menu at the top of the screen.\n\n*Click the iMessage tab at the top of the preferences menu.\n\n*The new email should be listed under \"You can be reached for messages at\".

After trying to get it out of hibernate, which wasn't successful, I forced the MacBook to shut down by keeping the power button pressed until it would shut down.\nProblem I'm experiencing now is that the MacBook won't boot and shuts down after the grey loading bar passes the +/- 40% mark. The disk is also not recognized when booted from an external HDD. Starting in safe mode is impossible. Starting the machine in verbose mode shows that there is a problem with replaying the journal.

I'd like to find a modern MKV video player app that supports macOS's new Picture in Picture feature.\nNote: I'm not interested in replicating PiP functionality, I'm only interested in the actual Picture in Picture feature.\n\nA: Picture-in-picture is a specific Safari browser and iTunes feature, and Safari is incompatible with MKV container file formats. At present there is no way to add macOS support for non-Apple approved container formats or codecs (the old Perian tool has not been updated for a very long time). \nThe way to achieve what you want would be to use an app like Adapter to convert the MKV file to MP4, which is natively understood by macOS apps, and then play it either in iTunes or QuickTime Player. In QuickTime Player you will need to select View -> Float on Top. This is not strictly picture-in-picture but has the exact same effect. \n\nA: IINA (https://iina.io/)\nI found that IINA can use macOS's native Picture in Picture mode.\n\nFor and only for modern macOS.\nIINA is born to be a modern macOS application, from its framework to\n  the user interface.

I'm trying to move some files out of my Time Machine backup to a new location on the external drive (outside of the Time Machine folder) that is in use for Time Machine.  I want to do this (as opposed to just copying from the original) primarily to retain all the hard links, not only between files under the directory I am moving, but also to previous backups, so I only maintain a single copy of everything.  Also, I don't have enough free space to make an additional actual copy!  But when I try to move the folder from Finder, I get the error:\n\"The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\"\nWhen I try to do it from the command line using mv I get the error: mv: rename [...] to [...]: Operation not permitted\nI read this question where in an answer it was explained that the \"bypass\" utility supposedly \"allows you to supply a command and argument to completely bypass the access restrictions.\"\nHowever, while I found this to work with the rm command, it failed with the same error as above when trying to move a directory.\nUpdate: It appears that if I type the full path to both the source and destination, then it works.  But even when it is outside the backup directory, the system still somehow knows it is a \"backup\" file, causing trouble trying to use it as a normal file.  How can I get rid of the \"backup\" bit or whatever that is making the system think it is a backup?\n\nA: If you list a file inside the TM backup with the Terminal command ls -l@, you'll see that it has extended attributes:\n$ ls -l@ \"iTunes Library Genius.itdb\"\n-rw-r--r--@ 22 admin  501  94208 Sep 17  2013 iTunes Library Genius.itdb\n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot     50 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot     50 \n\nI guess you'll have to remove those from the files that you moved outside the TM backup folder. I haven't tried that myself, though, as I do not want to mess with my backups :)\nTo remove these attributes, use the attr command with the \"c\" option, like this:\nxattr -c /path/to/file\n\nYou may have to use the bypass command for that again.\nLet us know whether that works.\n", "Q: How to make the right side of the trackpad of a MacBook Air behave as a right click?

I've created an application with a \"Run AppleScript\" action in Automator.\nI've created a Service in Automator which launches the aforementioned app.\nThe Service is triggered by a keyboard shortcut, assigned in System Preferences\nThe application presents a series of dialogs to the user. I would like to give the user the option of restarting the entire application mid-application.  For example, suppose that the following line was Line 100 of the code:\nset buttonChoice to button returned of (display alert \"Do you want to replace this entry?\" as critical buttons {\"Start over\", \"No\", \"Yes\"})\n\n   if buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then     \n      <this is where I need your help, Ask Different>\n   end if\n\nWhen I say \"restart\" or \"start over,\" I mean that I want to return the user to the initial dialog of the application, that is, the very first line of code of the application.\nCan this be done using AppleScript?\nIf needed, this is the location of the application file:\n\n/Applications/My Applications/My Log.app\n\n\nA: The following code example assume that the Run AppleScript action starts with an on run command without any list, e.g. {input, parameters} and consequently ends the script with end run:\non run\n\n    (*\n            This comment represents the e.g. previous 99 lines of code.\n        *)\n\n    set buttonChoice to button returned of (display alert \"Do you want to replace this entry?\" as critical buttons {\"Start over\", \"No\", \"Yes\"})\n    try\n        if buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n            return on run\n        end if\n    end try\n\n    (*\n            This comment represents the rest of the code in the script.\n        *)\n\nend run\n\nNote that I tested this in macOS Sierra 10.12 and while it does appear to start over, because if you press the \"Start over\" button it loops until you select another choice, I'm not sure this is the best way to implement this. I say that because I do not know the structure and coding of the rest of the script and that may make a difference along with the fact that while testing other code on each side of this, I was able to crash the app depending on what was going on if I looped more then once at this point.\nSo with that said, I'm offering this as something to test throughly before implementing it in the final code.\nI'd suggest just allowing the user to terminate the app with a message to manually restart by pressing the key-combo to trigger the service that starts the app over implementing a loop such as this.\n\nA: Update:\nI began with user3439894's solution as my base, but I had to make a couple of modifications to perfect the \"restart\" feature for my application (as user3439894 recommended).\nAt first, when I directly copied the solution, I was having an issue where the code would run one extra time after the restarted run completed. But, by trial and error, I managed to intuit a solution.\nHere's what I did to get it to work:\nI put the following line before the very first line of the main body of my code:\ntry\n\nand at the end of my main body of code, I put:\non error errStr number errorNumber\nend try\n\nAs instructed by user3439894, I also had to delete the default return input line from this location (and I had no need to return input in this application, anyway).\nThen, after every dialog of which I wanted the user to be presented with the option to start over in that dialog, I put:\nif buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n    return on run\nend if\n\nFollowing these steps, the \"restart\" function works perfectly! It doesn't repeat an extra number of times at the end, nor does it ever present the user with some error. I can also loop the application multiple times, if I so desire, without error or issue.\nIt even works perfectly when the dialogs are located in subroutines. Note that my subroutines are not within the try block.\n\nWhat happens when you need to use input in your AppleScript?\nI managed to discover a workaround. Simply place the restart code within a subroutine:\non run {input, parameters}\n    restartSubroutine()\n    return input\nend run\n\non restartSubroutine()\n    set buttonChoice to button returned of (display alert \"Do you want to replace this entry?\" as critical buttons {\"Start over\", \"No\", \"Yes\"})\n\n    try\n        if buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n            return on run restartSubroutine()\n            (*\n            The following lines work as well:\n            return on restartSubroutine()\n            return run restartSubroutine()\n            *)\n        end if\n    end try\nend restartSubroutine\n\nOf course, the restart function will only take you back to the beginning of that subroutine, not to the first line of the main body. But, if you don't need to reference the input until the end of your script, this may work for you so that you can have a functional restart button right up until the moment that you need input.\n\nEdit:\nI just figured out an even better workaround:\non run {input, parameters}\n    restartSubroutine(input)\n    return input\nend run\n\non restartSubroutine(input)\n    set buttonChoice to button returned of (display alert \"Do you want to replace this entry?\" as critical buttons {\"Start over\", \"No\", \"Yes\"})\n\n    if buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n        return restartSubroutine(input)\n    end if      \nend restartSubroutine\n\nIf you send the input to a subroutine, then you can have a restart function all while having access to the input contents. Win-win.\n\nA: I've discovered another method to restart an AppleScript. \nThis method is not \"better\" than the other methods that have been provided; it is merely just another way of approaching things. Here's how you can restart an .scpt file in AppleScript:\nif buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n    run script \"/Users/Me/Desktop/My script.scpt\"\n    error number -128 (* user cancelled *)\nend if\n\nOr, alternatively:\nif buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n    run script (path to me)\n    error number -128 (* user cancelled *)\nend if\n\nThis code simply creates another instance of the currently running AppleScript .scpt file, and then quits the current instance.\nI learned about run script from a comment by user Camelot on the following webpage:\nCall Another Applescript | Apple Communities\n\nWith the same underlying premise, if you want to restart an .app file using AppleScript, then use this:\nif buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n    do shell script \"open -n \" & quoted form of \"/Users/Me/Desktop/My app.app\"\n    error number -128 (* user cancelled *)\nend if\n\nOr, alternatively:\nif buttonChoice is \"Start over\" then\n    do shell script \"open -n \" & (quoted form of (POSIX path of (path to me)))\n    error number -128 (* user cancelled *)\nend if\n\nThe -n allows a new instance of the application to open, even if an instance of this application is already running. The  -n is necessary because, practically speaking, the AppleScript app technically closes after the second instance has been created, even though this may not appear to be the case based on what one sees on their screen.\n\nWhen should one use this method of restarting?\nThis is going to get a little confusing, so bear with me...\nI have an AppleScript .scpt file that automatically runs when my computer wakes from sleep. (I use SleepWatcher to accomplish this.)\nThis .scpt file calls a specific subroutine of a different .scpt file; it skips over the entire script, and only runs the code that is found in one, specific subroutine. (To accomplish this, I use the method described here.)\nThis second .scpt file is rife with \"Start over\" buttons in nearly every dialog, employing:\nreturn on run\n\nto achieve the restarting effect. (This restart method was provided in a previous answer to this question.)\nNow, the problem is, while my first .scpt file does in fact successfully restart the second .scpt file when return on run is used in the second .scpt file, once the script has completed, a dialog box containing the following error is presented to the user:\n\n«script» doesn’t understand the “return”\n\nTo be fair, this error makes sense; the first .scpt file cannot fully comprehend the significance of return, because it was never truly running the other script. It was only running one subroutine of the other script.\nThis error bugged me. So, I messed around with the code some more, and learned about run script. The specific type of scenario that I've just explained is where the run script restart method truly shines.\nThe simple run script method saves the day: it restarts the second .scpt file, and without having to invoke the return command in the process. Thus, this method is completely error-free, even when being run outside of its larger, surrounding code. This is the only method on this page that can do this, as the other methods are reliant on return.\n", "Q: Annoying MacWizz Ads I have recently been having trouble with MacWizz ads on my Chrome browser.

Is there a well known functionality in Macs once they connect to the Internet?\n\nA: Activity Monitor\nTo see the number of sent packages you can use \"Activity Monitor\".\nOpen it and choose the \"Network\" tab. Click the \"Sent Bytes\" column to sort all applications by data sent.\n\nLittle Snitch\nYou can use a firewall software like \"Little Snitch\" to monitor any incoming and outgoing network connections. It can display a detailed traffic history which you can filter by application.\nIt is a paid software but you can use the trial for a few days and remove it afterwards.\nKeep in mind that this requires you to install the software on the client's machine.\n\nA: Activity monitor and Little Snitch are good places to start. \nWith some aggravation, you can set up Wireshark which is an GUI interface to tcpdump.\nA better option for this sort of thing is to repurpose an old laptop that has 2 ethernet ports, and set it up as a general network tool.  In one mode, you set it up as a bridge.  It doesn't have an ip address of it's own, but merely copies the packets that come through.\nTurn off wifi on the suspect macbook, and connect it by cable to your network tool.

Before making the investment in memories, can someone help me?\n\nA: The memory you specified, will not work.  It is PC3-12800 while the memory you need is PC3-10600.\nAccording to Everymac.com, your particular model can support up to 16GB of memory.  \n\nApple officially supports a maximum of 8GB of RAM, but as first confirmed by site sponsor OWC, this model actually is capable of using up to 16 GB of RAM with two 8 GB memory modules.\n\nPersonally, I always recommend upgrading to the maximum amount of memory that you can get (I believe in the mantra it's better to have and not need, than need and not have).

Will it likely see a price drop this cycle? Is it best to hold off till March to buy one?\n\nA: Only Apple knows the answer to this question.\nWhile one may think that Apple could lower the price it could in fact go up: Depending on the country you are living prices have been increased in the past due to currency fluctuations.\nIMO it's unlikely that we will see a price drop for the iPhone SE. For Apple it's a device with a really low profit margin compared to other products. It has most of the iPhone 6s' internal specs so Apple is in no hurry to upgrade it either.\nI think if you need a new iPhone because your old one is broken, buy it now.\n", "Q: WhatsApp web option not displayed in WhatsApp iPhone I have an iPhone 4S with WhatsApp.\nI install WhatsApp Web on my PC.

The image background is represented as black, instead of transparent.\nThe link there shows that it's a \"color profile\" bug - is there a correct color profile that supports transparency?\n\nA: It seems to depend on how the image was made in the first place, & what its current background is set to.\nTesting with the example given in comments I see the same behaviour as the OP when using Preview.\nEven in Photoshop the same thing happens... unless I turn the image into an unlocked layer first. After that, erasing will then erase to transparent.\nI've tested with other images made in photoshop with transparency, then saved as jpg. I also checked converting the jpg to png first, before testing.\nIt seems Preview is not the only app which will knock out to a predetermined colour, Photoshop will do the same, unless first converted to a separate layer. [In Photoshop you get the choice of which colour, but 'transparent' isn't an option.]\nI'd say therefore, it's not a bug, it's intended behaviour; a limitation of a single-layered image.  \nI see no way round this except to use a dedicated graphics package, like Photoshop or Gimp.\n\nA: Even though this problem is old, I did figure out a solution that works (on Mojave at least, haven't tried it anywhere else).\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a PNG image somewhere that already has a transparent background.\n\n*In Preview, remove the contents of that image and resize it to match your source image.\n\n*Copy the source image and paste it onto this (now blank) PNG image.\n\n*Export the image as PNG, making sure Alpha is checked. You now have an image with transparent background and your old image as a second layer.\n\n*You can use the Magic Alpha on this new image and it will be saved properly.\n\n\nHope this helps anyone out there still struggling with this!\n\nA: Here's a helpful answer posted in the Apple discussion from the original Q:\n\n*\n\n*instead of editing an existing image, take a screenshot of the image – Shift + Cmd + 5 on most Mac's\n\n*remove the background from the screenshot using Preview's Instant Alpha markup tool\n\n*save the image and the edited screenshot should have a transparent background :)\n\n", "Q: In Sierra, did Apple remove the ability to play HLS streams in Quicktime Player?

Macs do not natively support this file type (you'll notice that neither Quicktime nor iTunes will play them) and lack the specific decoding algorithm for the *.mkv format by default (also known as a 'codec'), so the system actually doesn't know what to do with them. Technically the *.mkv format is actually considered an open standard container format (not a video format), which means that it's not limited to any specific coding format (it can hold pretty much anything). Macs group 'container' files that aren't natively supported media types as 'Other'.\nI know what you're thinking, and YES, it IS weird that it can figure it out in Finder though. I have no facts on why, only a guess. It might be because we've installed a 3rd party media player capable of handling and decoding the file. So basically the 3rd party player knows what an *.mkv file is, the system knows that the 3rd party player is in fact a video player, but unfortunately it doesn't come back around to close the information loop. It would be nice if that 3rd party player could pass that info on to the system though, wouldn't it?\n", "Q: Make Applescript press LShift Exactly what the title says...\nI'm new to coding and I am trying to make AppleScript simulate the key press of LShift.

So what are the first year macbooks that supported booting from usb?\n\nA: Short Answer\nAny Intel Mac capable of running Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.5 is capable of booting from USB (so long as the version of Mac OS X on that USB is at least Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.5.\nSince all MacBook models are Intel Macs, the model year is irrelevant aince all Intel Macs are capable of booting from USB so long as they're running Mac OS X 10.4.5 or later. For the record though, Apple started producing MacBooks in 2006 and the original MacBook Pro (January 2006) came pre-installed with Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.5. \nYou can read more about how to set up and use an external Mac startup disk.\nLong Answer\nIn practice I've found that it's easier to boot from USB with MacBook models from late 2008 onwards, espececially if you want to boot from a USB flash drive. I cannot advise specifically why this has been the case in my personal experience (maybe I wasn't doing it right in those early years of Intel Macs), nor whether other people have had different levels of success. However, since your model MacBook Pro is a 2009 model (based on your comment) this will not be an issue for you. Just be sure to follow the how to set up and use an external Mac startup disk if you intend to do this.\nExtra info\nIt may be of interest to some people that it was technically possible to boot from USB in the pre-Mac OS X era with the introduction of dual channel USB in 1999. Slot loading iMacs and a model of the AGP PowerMac G4 were able to boot from USB drives.\nAs an aside, you can't start a Mac in Target Disk Mode using a USB cable. To do this your Mac will need to have a FireWire port or a Thunderbolt 2 or 3 port or a USB-C port. See Share files between two computers with target disk mode for more info.\n", "Q: Arpwatch for Yosemite? Any pointers to arpwatch or equivalent for OS X Yosemite?  I'd rather not have to  use Macports. Sledge hammers on gnats etc.  I found one, Mocha, but it requires a version of Java 6. Current Java version is 8, and I recall 6 having all sorts of security issues.\nThis arises as my MacBook Pro is detecting another device using it's IP address.\nCommand line version is fine.\n\nA: You can simply right-click /Applications/Mocha.app/Contents/Resources/Java/mocha.jar and launch it with the Java Launcher. I don't know if the JRE version contains this \"app\" - at least the JDK does.\nAfter modifying the innards (e.g the info.plist & JavaApplicationStub) it may also be possible to launch the app itself without installing Java6, but I didn't get this to work.\n", "Q: Crontab and session locked I would like to execute a script on my machine every five minutes, even when I am not in front of my mac OS X Yosemite. Therefore, I would like to lock my session and shut off the screen while the computer stays active.

I've recently installed Windows using Boot Camp Assistant and now I want to remove it.\nTo remove the BOOTCAMP partition I have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to Boot Camp Assistant > Continue > Restore\nResult it was stuck half way.\n\n*Going to Disk Utility > click BOOTCAMP partition > Erase > Mac OS\nExtended (Journaled)\nResult Unmounting disk. Couldn’t open disk. Operation failed…\nCan someone help me with this?\n\nA: When you say \"going to bootcamp assistant -> continue\" do you mean you did something similar to the steps in this Apple support answer? Note that there are different steps depending on if you have a single or multiple internal drives.\nIf you are using the Disk Repair Utility, have you tried booting into the Disk Utility (hold down command+r when you boot the computer or restart)?\nEspecially if you have a single internal drive you may also want to create a bootable USB drive, and then boot to it to use Disk Utility to alter the boot drive partitioning (so the drive is not reading and writing to the same physical media). Holding down option when you start allows you to select the startup drive.\n\nA: You could try booting to internet recovery by holding down Option + Command + R after the computer chimes on boot.  Then you are able to open Disk Utility (not located on the system's hard drive) and try to erase it from there.\nAlternatively, you could try clicking on the drive it is installed on (not the partition) and then choose the \"Partition\" tab.  Here you can click on the BOOTCAMP partition and select the \"-\" in the bottom left corner, then apply those changes.\n", "Q: iPhone 6S - Not getting Push Notification and Badge icon related to OS Updates I bought an iPhone 6S three months back. Earlier I was not aware that I would get push notifications regarding iOS updates. However, later I became aware of this thanks to a friend. Since buying my iPhone, Apple has released 3 updates and I had not received a single notifcation of these.\nIf I go manually and check for software update, then I can see it. Why are other devices getting notififcations regarding iOS Updates and I'm not? I have formatted my iPhone 3 times and the latest one was done by Apple service and they set it up as new iPhone.\nPlease help me out regarding this issue.\n\nA: The problem with this type of question is that it can only be verified as resolved under the right circumstances. \nAlthough you say you have reset the iPhone three times, and once at an Apple service centre, it's not clear what type of reset was done. My advice is to follow these steps to try and resolve your issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer and launch iTunes (if it isn't already open). Note: You may need to enter a passcode or trust this computer.\n\n*Select your iPhone when it appears in iTunes. (Note: If you're prompted to update iOS do not download/install the update.\n\n*Manually do a full backup of your iPhone to your computer (i.e. not just to iCloud). You can do this by clicking on the Back Up Now button. This may take some time depending on how much data you have.\n\n*Once your backup is complete, disconnect the iPhone from your computer.\n\n*On the iPhone go to Settings > General\n\n*Swipe up and tap on the Reset option at the bottom\n\n*Tap on Erase all Content and Settings\n\n*Follow the prompts to erase/reset your iPhone\n\n*Once you've reset your iPhone, reconnect it to your Mac or PC and launch iTunes (if it isn't already open). Note: You may need to enter a passcode or trust this computer.\n\n*Select your iPhone when it appears in iTunes\n\n*When prompted, choose to Restore your iPhone from the backup you made at Step 3\n\n*Follow the prompts to restore your iPhone\n\n\nOnce these steps are complete you will have hopefully resolved your issue. \nAt the time of writing this, iOS 10.2.1 was just released (hence why at Step 2 I didn't want you downloading/installing the update if prompted). \nIf you haven't already installed this update, then you should get your notification soon. On the other hand, if iOS 10.2.1 was already installed then you won't know if these steps have resolved your issue until Apple releases the next update.\nEDIT re: Timing\nI just wanted to add a bit of info on the timing of notifications relating to iOS updates.\nTypically, after an iOS update is release, users should get a badge notification with a '1' that sometime in the first 48hrs - 72hrs. However, an actual push notification may not come until quite some time after and only if your device hasn't been updated yet. \nUsing myself as an example, I have an iPhone 6s which I've had since September 2015 (it's now Feb 2017). In that whole time I've never had a push notification about an iOS update because I always update my iPhone fairly quickly. However, my wife who also got an iPhone 6s at the same time as I did, did get a push notification for iOS 10 at some point (weeks after iOS 10 launched) because she was still on iOS 9.3.5 and was in no hurry to update (I'm usually her guinea pig with these things). However, she did eventually update from iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 10 because the notification was relentless annoying her (and because iOS 10 was working well for me).\nIn summary, what I am saying is that a badge icon should appear within 72hrs of the official release, but that a push notification message may take weeks and only if arrive if you haven't updated.\n", "Q: Reset/change Emoji color for human features I inadvertently hit the wrong color for a human emoji.

I've just been Googling about this, but I can't find definitive information (some sites claim things that I'm unsure of).  Which is faster for connecting an ethernet cable to a MacBook Pro - a Thunderbolt adapter or a USB 3.0 adapter?  I've seen some claims that Thunderbolt can do a full gigabit while USB 3.0 can only do 100mb - but then again I've seen many USB 3.0 adapters advertised on Amazon as being capable of \"10/100/1000 gigabit.\"  So, what's the verdict?  Which is faster?\n(EDIT: I've also just noticed that some USB 2.0 adapters are listed as \"10/100/1000 gigabit\" capable.  Are they really as fast as the USB 3.0 and potentially Thunderbolt adapters?)\n\nA: SHORT ANSWER\nThe answer to your question as asked in the title is it really depends on what ports you have available, personal preference, cost, etc.\nI say this because both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt are faster than ethernet, so it doesn't matter which way you go from a speed point of view.\nMore specifically (and at the risk of oversimplifying it):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet supports up to 1Gbps*\n\n*USB 3.0 supports up to 5Gbps\n\n*USB 3.1 supports up to 10Gbps\n\n*Thunderbolt 1 up to 10Gbps\n\n*Thunderbolt 2 up to 20Gbps\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 up to 40Gbps\n\n\n*In the overwhelming majority of cases, although 10Gbps ethernet networks do exist.\nSo, as you can see, it doesn't matter because they're all faster than the ethernet you're converting to.\nLONG ANSWER\nI'm adding this longer answer due to the various comments below my original answer.\nFor starters, ethernet can actually support up to 10Gbps. However, in 99.9% of cases (okay, I can't cite a source for that figure - I'm just making a point) this will not be a practical consideration for users unless they intend to connect to an existing 10Gbps ethernet network. While 10Gbps ethernet is starting to gain some traction in terms of network infrastructure, this is only happening in some of the largest organisations or those that have a particular need for this type of setup (such as ISPs, Cloud providers, data centres, etc). It is also worth noting that Apple has never launched a computer (not even Mac Pros or Servers) that natively support 10Gbps ethernet.\nOne of the reasons for a slow take up rate of 10Gbps ethernet is that it requires full duplex point-to-point links (typically via network switches) and as a result half duplex operation and repeater hubs do not work in 10Gbps ethernet networks. So converting existing ethernet networks to a 10Gbps ethernet network is no trivial matter and is quite expensive. All that said, I expect the deployment of 10Gbps ethernet networks to really start taking off more broadly due to the demands of HD video editing and the requirement of more organisations to have high-performance shared storage systems. \nBut in terms of typical consumers, this is not something worth considering when wanting to add an ethernet port to a computer and making a decision on the type of adapter they need.\nA word about latency\nA lot has been made about latency in the comments. While latency is a factor - especially when large networks with many network devices are involved - it's less of an issue for typical consumers. \nDoes latency matter to typical consumers?\nYes and no. A user on a home network who needs to transfer some photos and documents from a MacBook to an iMac is not going to be too concerned if it takes a couple of seconds for the transfer to commence. On the other hand, if the same user is browsing the web and it takes a couple of seconds for a page to start loading, that can be enough for them to move on to something else. So, latency can be very important to the overall user experience, but how important it is also depends on the application. If we spend hours on the internet we want our pages to load quickly, and latency can definitely affect this (just talk to any Satellite internet user). On the other hand, if we only transfer files across a home network occasionally, it's less important.\nSo, what is latency? \nAt the risk of oversimplifying things, latency refers to the delay in transmission time that occurs while data remains in a device's buffered memory (e.g. bridge, router, etc) before it can be sent along its path. While it seems to only be hardware related, latency is in fact affected by both hardware and software factors. Some are listed below:\nHardware factors\n\n\n*\n\n*Traversing the network medium\n\n*Traversing network switches and devices\n\n*Transmission through the PCIe bus\n\n*Memory access times\n\n*Length of network cables\n\n*Etc etc\n\n\nSoftware factors\n\n\n*\n\n*Firmware running on the adapter\n\n*The device driver controlling the adapter\n\n*Operating system execution\n\n*The portion of the network stack that data has to transmit over\n\n*Etc etc\n\n\nRegardless of the factor involved, the impact of latency on network bandwidth can be temporary or persistent.\nHow is latency measured?\nIn terms of ethernet networks, latency can be measured with different tools and methods, such as specified by IEEE RFC2544, netperf, or Ping-Pong (no, not the table tennis game). Put very simply, the main difference in these various methods is the point at which latency is measured. Regardless though, while excessive latency can limit the performance of network applications by delaying data arrival, this delay in a typical consumer network is less likely to be noticeable because there aren't usually too many network devices in consumer networks. That is, because there are less adapters, bridges, routers, etc involved between the source and destination, the total latency should be less. While users can do pings and traceroutes to measure this delay, in real world home applications (e.g. transferring files) it's not going to be noticeable unless there is a problem somewhere.\nSo, is latency a factor in determining the type of ethernet adapter one purchases?\nYes and no. In a sense this is irrelevant in a small/home network because there just aren't going to be many network devices. But if you have to make a decision on which type of adapter to purchase for 6 computers per room in a building of 10 rooms where all the computers are on the same ethernet network connected by multiple bridges etc, then it is much more relevant.\nThunderbolt v USB 3 re latency \nSo, which type of adapter is better in terms of latency? Generally, a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter is likely to have a lower latency then a USB 3 to Ethernet adapter. But, as manufacturers focus on bandwidth or throughput when they publish specs, you're not going to find it easy to try and quantify this or compare adapters. \nSo, why would I prefer a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter? To be honest, in a small/home network I probably wouldn't as I think the difference would be negligible and unnoticeable to the naked eye (so to speak). For me, the choice would come down to what ports I have available (or am willing to sacrifice) and the cost. But if it was a large network my preference for Thunderbolt is based on the real world experiences of users in particular fields. \nFor example, in the music production industry users have found that with audio devices capable of being connected either through Thunderbolt or USB3, that the overall audio latency of the connection is about 1ms for Thunderbolt and 4.5ms for USB 3. Now, these speeds can be impacted by other factors, but since these setups involve the exact same equipment, it appears that for whatever reason the Thunderbolt connection is faster (probably because Thunderbolt is allowed almost straight access to the CPU). \nWhether this difference would be replicated in terms of a typical ethernet network is unclear. By that I mean connecting a PC to specialised audio equipment directly via Thunderbolt is different to connecting a PC to an ethernet network via a Thunderbolt or USB 3 adapter. Even if it was replicated, while audio latency may be noticeable to music professionals, the transfer of files and documents is different again.\n\nA: USB 3.0 has the following speeds:\n\n\n*\n\n*gross: 500 MByte/s -> 4'000 MBit/s -> 4 GBit/s\n\n*net: 450 Mbyte/s -> 3'600 MBit/s -> 3.6 GBit/s\n\n*real value: 275-300 MByte/s -> 2'200 - 2'400 MBit/s -> 2.2-2.4 GBit/s\n\n\nThunderbolt 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*gross: 20GBit/s\n\n\nThunderbolt 3:\n\n\n*\n\n*gross: 40 GBit/s\n\n\nThunderbolt is indeed faster, but with a gigabit connection you won't notice any differences.\n\nA: \nWhich is faster for connecting an ethernet cable to a MacBook Pro - a Thunderbolt adapter or a USB 3.0 adapter?\n\nThat depends on how fast your network is and how much you are prepared to spend.\nAt 1 gigabit I would expect little to no difference between USB3 and Thunderbolt. In both cases the Ethernet link should be the bottleneck.\nEthernet doesn't stop at 1 gigabit though. There are a couple of Thunderbolt to dual 10GBASE-T Ethernet adaptors on the market. One from Promise, one from Sonnet. The promise one is cheaper but the one review of it on the apple site says it doesn't live up to it's specs and recommends getting the sonnet one instead. \n\nA: As said in other answers, both interfaces are more than able to handle the 1GB Ethernet bandwidth and in fact most adapters will provide roughly the same performance.\nThe choice will come down to the price of the adapter (USB3 might be cheaper) and which port you are willing to sacrifice for the Ethernet connectivity.\nYou may choose the Thunderbolt adapter if you're on the move and don't have a USB3 hub with you. You'll run out of USB port way before running out of Thunderbolt port in this situation.\nYou may choose the USB adapter if you're on desktop mode with a USB3 hub, that way you can keep the Thunderbolt ports for display or other purposes.\nAlso note that if you're switching between computers or operating systems, USB adapter are widely compatibles whereas Thunderbolt is only fully supported on macOS at the moment (I had minor issues with the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter and a MBP under Windows or Linux).\n\nA: Here's a review comparing the two adapters.\n\n\n*\n\n*In terms of raw throughput, there is no significant difference (111-115 MB/s on both adapters)\n\n*USB is reported to disconnect under heavy loads and to have troubles with wake-up. However, it's not clear to me whether those issues are caused by the USB hub or the adapter itself. To me, it sounds like the hub may not be powered properly.\n\n*In terms of CPU utilization Thunderbolt adapter is better, but not by a lagre margin (22% CPU load vs. 30% in case of USB 3.0)\n\n\nWhat you really need to consider is how versatile the respective adapter will be. If you have other computers with no Thunderbolt slot, USB sounds like a better idea. On the other hand, if you always happen to have a Thunderbolt slot and it's never in use, buying a Thunderbolt adapter will save you a USB slot.\n\nA: The developer Marco Arment answered this question. His data was as follows:\n\nApple USB Ethernet Adapter: 94 Mbps (it’s a 10/100 device, and only\n  USB 2)\nWireless via 802.11n: 118 Mbps (to the newest AirPort Extreme, 15 feet\n  away)\nThunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter: 941 Mbps\n\n\nA: I would recommend Thunderbolt, as it is essentially external PCI-Express, which is the same bus an internal network card (among other things like graphics cards, etc) is attached to.\nPCI-E (and thus Thunderbolt) support DMA, which allows the network card to write packets to the system's memory directly without involving the CPU. USB as far as I know does not support DMA and will require cooperation from the CPU to copy every single network packet to memory.\n\nA: An answer from my personal experience: I've used both\n\n\n*\n\n*original Apple's Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter\n\n*Cable Matters DB50 USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet adapter\n\n\nand noticed no difference when testing for speed nor in daily use.\n\nA: Any article you read about a USB ethernet adapter only being able to reach 100Mbps is likely false unless a particular adapter is a total dud. What is true is that a USB 2.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter, or a USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter connected to a USB 2.0 port can only handle around 400Mbps - the link speed of USB 2.0 caps out at 480Mbps. \nA USB 3.0 Gig-E adapter connected to a USB 3.0 port on a computer with sufficient CPU resources can achieve full gigabit speeds. A thunderbolt adapter may place less stress on the CPU. A thunderbolt adapter is however less universally useful as fewer computers can support it. Worse, it is my experience that you cannot connect a thunderbolt ethernet adapter to a Macbook running Windows while it is running. You must reboot to allow the system to detect the new PCI-E device. (This does not happen in Mac OS.) This could have been fixed by now, but it was enough of a nuisance that I eschewed the objectively superior thunderbolt adapter for a USB 3.0 device instead.\n\nA: A small extension of the very thorough answer by @Monomeeth.\nThunderbolt 3 is a beast of a protocol and hardware solution capable of speeds of 20 Gbps over copper, passive cables or 40 Gbps over active (copper or optical) cables. As a matter of fact Thunderbolt also allows for networking, which should be present in all major operating systems including Linux kernel 4.15+ shortly. So you can connect two computers over Thunderbolt and implement a ~ 10 Gbps network connection with that.\nAs an alternative, there are \"host to host\" USB cables in a version with USB 2.0 (not recommended) and USB 3.0 (this is in the spec, section 5.5.2 mentions other \"host-to-host applications\") speeds. This is also called ethernet over usb and I heard people tell it works well enough and is also supported in Linux. Prolific has some offerings, that should be solid.\nIn addition to regular USB 3.0 to one gigabit ethernet port adapter you can also get a USB 3.0 to two gigabit ethernet ports adapter, such as StarTech USB32000SPT.\nOf course, many of these adapter will have problems, like not reliably or not at all supporting PXE boot, Wake on LAN, VLAN tags or higher MTU sizes. There are no offload engines and support for really advanced stuff like SR-IOV you can just forget about in most cases.\n\nA: I have used both, the TB2 Apple 1 Gbps Ethernet adapter, and the Anker USB 3.0 1 Gbps adapter. I cannot see any difference between the two. Btw, TB carries multiple protocols, TB3 is only able on carrying 4 x 8 Gbps data. Only when mixed with Display Port, you get the 40 Gbps. On all platforms, besides the new Ice Lake SoC, two TB ports share these 32 Gbps.\n\nA: For the new MacBook pro with thunderbolt 3 over usb type-c port. The \"Delock Adapter SuperSpeed USB (USB 3.1 Gen 1) with USB Type-C™ male > Gigabit LAN 10/100/1000 Mbps compact\" is your answer. It supports usb down to usb 2.0 but will also do gigabit ethernet over thunderbolt.\n", "Q: Replace MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) battery from MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) The macbook i am using currently is MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012).

I tried and reviewed all (except for the removing of the email account) and came to a solution which worked for me:\n1 - went to the account settings that was giving me the issue and changed the \"Sync\" period to 1 day.\n(Settings / Mail / Accounts / <email account> / Sync Mail)\n2 - get our of the settings and open the mail app. Wait for it to sync, once the account is synced, the emails you wished to be removed will still be there, but just delete them (again).\n3 - you will still receive the \"message could not be moved to the trash\" notification, however, the messages will not return to your inbox (as they did previously).\n4 - wait a couple of days to go back to your settings and change the sync period to whatever you like.\nThis worked for me and I believe it should work for anybody which the previous solutions did not work with.\nFor me I believe it was an issue when I deleted the emails both from the server and the iphone mail client when it (the iphone) was not connected to the internet.\nAnyway I hope this helps!\n\nA: When this issue occurs it usually means that the Mail client on your device is having difficulty syncing with the email service provider's server. I've noticed that this issue occurs most often when trying to delete a very large (50+) amount of emails at once rather than a few at a time (but this is not always the case), or when your network connection is spotty or was interrupted.\nHow most mail clients (applications) work:\nWhen you select a message and tell it to 'Move to Trash' the Mail.app puts it in the local Trash within the Mail.app first. Next, it's supposed to send a signal to the mail server to tell it to place the copy of that message that's hosted on the server into the Trash on the server. This usually happens within seconds, and you don't usually notice the delay. However, if for some reason the connection to the mail server is poor or interrupted, this can cause the server to not receive the signal sent from the Mail.app to delete the message(s) off of the server. The same issue can occur when simply trying to empty the trash as well, or when moving messages from one folder to another within the account. (Usually when one action doesn't work the others have difficulty as well.)\nTo resolve the issue:\nFor most accounts the first thing you would do is ensure that all of the account settings are correct in 'Settings > Mail > Accounts' - cross-referencing them with the ones provided by your email service provider - but because we're working with an iCloud account these settings are automatically configured.\nThis leaves us with two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to iCloud.com from a web browser on a computer, login, and then delete the messages that are\ngiving you trouble right from the source. Remember to empty the Trash from the settings icon in the bottom left when you're done. This will fix the\nimmediate issue, but it doesn't always prevent the issue from re-occurring in\nthe future.\n\n*Disable the iCloud mail feature from 'Settings > iCloud' by turning\noff the 'Mail' switch, restarting your iPhone, and then re-enabling it. It may take a few minutes for your messages to re-appear in the Mail.app upon the first launch as it has to re-sync everything with the iCloud servers.\n\n\nFor best results, we can combine both steps. Turn off iCloud Mail on your iPhone from 'Settings > iCloud', then go to iCloud.com and delete any messages you no longer want (remembering to empty the Trash from the settings icon in the bottom left when you're done). Restart your iPhone and then re-enable iCloud Mail from 'Settings > iCloud' on your iPhone. This will make it so that the current messages you don't want on your iPhone will never sync to it in the first place.\n", "Q: Terminal shows \">\" after running command I am new to Mac Terminal.

Is it just because they share the same driver (weird)?\nI'm using HDMI with a MiniDisplay to HDMI adapter.\nEDIT: I'd like to run at the native resolution, possibly enabling retina, or at least the biggest resolution that the MBA mid-2012 can handle, which should be around 2,500something.\n\nA: To answer your questions about running a 4K display with a Mid 2012 MacBook Air 11\"/13\":\nUnfortunately the 2012 MBA isn't technically able to do so.\nThe 2012 MBA has an Intel HD Graphics 4000 GPU which supports only up to 2560x1600 px via its Thunderbolt port directly. Attaching another video adapter (like HDMI) may reduce the maximum possible resolution.\nDepending on the external display it may choose a lower resolution if if the source (your MBA) is not capable of driving the display's native resolution. It appears that your MBA reduces the resolution to 1920x1080 px when you connect it to the display's HDMI port.\nIf possible use a miniDisplayport to Displayport cable to connect your computer to the display. You may be able to use a resolution of 2560x1600 px.\n", "Q: My Dock and Launchpad appear to have died So around last month my dock decided to make my notification badges blue and very large. I have no clue why. I’ve tried resetting the preferences, restoring them from time machine, restoring Dock.app from Time Machine and nothing works. Whatever caused this, also broke LaunchPad because the instant I try to open it, it just crashes, the dock quits and restarts, and it never appears. Any ideas?\nRetina 5K iMac (iMac15,1) macOS 10.12.1\n\nA: First off, I would install any macOS software updates from the App Store in case it's a weird, uncommon bug with that version. (Current version is 10.12.2)\nIf your issue is not resolved after this, I would highly recommend testing in a new user account to determine whether or not the issue is system-wide. You could also boot into Safe Mode to see if the issue persists there. This would narrow down the list of possible culprits immensely!\nIf the issue appears to be user-based not system-wide, and still occurs in Safe Mode, I would then recommend rebuilding the the Launchpad database if you haven't tried this already.\nWhen an issue does not occur in Safe Mode and has not resolved itself after restarting out of Safe Mode (yes, it can happen - albeit not often), it usually points to an issue with a kernel extension, third-party font, or a startup/login item. So at least if this is the case, we'll know where to start looking.\nTo rebuild the Launchpad Databases:\nNote: Having a backup of your system is highly recommended as some of the tasks you will be performing delete user library data; not to mention you will be working with a couple of Terminal commands which if typed incorrectly can cause issues with your system.\nClick here for my reference\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Launchpad, if it's open. You can do this by clicking anywhere\nin the Launchpad app, as long as you don't click on an app icon.\n\n*Open a Finder window.\n\n*You need to access your Library folder, which is hidden by the\noperating system. You can gain access to this folder by using the\ninstructions in OS X Is Hiding Your Library Folder. Once you have\nthe Library folder open and visible in the Finder, you can continue\nto the next step.\n\n*In the Library folder, locate and open the Application Support\nfolder.\n\n*In the Application Support folder, locate and open the Dock folder.\n\n*You'll find a number of files in the Dock folder, including one\nnamed desktoppicture.db, and one or more files starting with a\ndashed set of capital letters and numbers, and ending in .db. An\nexample file name is FE0131A-54E1-2A8E-B0A0A77CFCA4.db. Grab all the\nfiles in the Dock folder with the dashed set of letters and numbers\nthat end in .db and drag them to the trash.\n\n*Launch Terminal, located in the /Applications/Utilities folder.\n\n*In the Terminal window, enter the following: defaults write\ncom.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true\n\n*Press enter or return to issue the command.\n\n*In the Terminal window, enter: killall Dock\n\n*Press enter or return.\n\n*You can now quit Terminal.\n\n\nI would suggest restarting your Mac at this point and then testing the issue. Keep in mind that the first time you open Launchpad it has to rebuild the databases it needs so it may take a bit longer to launch.\n", "Q: “Your system has run out of application memory”, but memory pressure is not even at 50%? The system has 16GB of memory, and the memory pressure looks well below even 50%. This doesn't make any sense. Usually the message starts popping after about 10 days without restarting.\nAny light to shed here? I used to have a 12GB hackintosh with Yosemite and this NEVER happened, it lasted stable without restarting for months at a time, this is really ridiculous, I was really expecting for Apple hardware to be more reliable, not less.\n\n\nA: Note that memory pressure does not have a one-to-one relationship with the percent of memory used. Here's a previous thread explaining how pressure is measured.\nYour system appears to have used all physical RAM you have (13.6 GB actively used, 2.3 GB of cached ram). Thus, when you open new applications or attempt to load a new webpage, some of the data in physical RAM is swapped to disk. If your disk is full, and it can't swap any more RAM, then this \"Out of Memory\" error could occur. \nI'm somewhat confident this is a software issue, not hardware. As you mentioned, you don't regularly reboot your Mac. Rebooting essentially resets RAM, freeing up significant amounts of space. Taking a quick glance at the process list, there seem to be a lot of \"status-bar\" apps that reside in the background (like Telegram). Having so many applications open over the course of 10 days probably means a significant amount of information is being cached in RAM, which is why you have so high memory usage. \nFix this by closing stuff you aren't using, or reboot every time this happens. Alternatively, switch to a different browser (if you can/are willing) since Chrome has a litany of nice but memory-intensive features such as preloading search results. \nIf you're interested in finding what is really causing the memory usage, this very thorough thread has instructions.\nFinally, the reason you never had this issue on Yosemite may have been that you simply didn't open as many apps, restarted more often, or had more disk space for swap. \nTL;DR: Restart regularly, and close unused apps. Maybe switch browsers. \n", "Q: Remove Bookmark and Reading List Sidebar Tapping the book icon to the left of the address bar does not remove the Bookmarks/Reading List Sidebar.

When one adds a \"Run AppleScript\" action to a file in Automator.app (e.g., a workflow, application, or service), the following default code is presented:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    (* Your script goes here *)\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nWhat is the significance of input and parameters? That is to say,\n\n\n*\n\n*Where does the AppleScript code get these variables from?\n\n*To where exactly does the AppleScript return the input to?\n\n*How might these variables be ideally employed in an AppleScript application/service? Examples are appreciated.\n\nA: I'll try to answer my own question, making use of the relevant documentation1 provided by @user3439894 in a comment on my question.\nWhere does the AppleScript code get these variables from?\ninput:\n\nThe input parameter contains (in most instances) the output of the previous action in the workflow.\n\nThe data type of input is list.\nTo display the contents of input in Automator's corresponding \"Results\" pane for that specific action, simply use:\nreturn input\n\n\nparameters:\n\nThe parameters parameter contains the settings made in the action’s user interface.\n\nThe data type of parameters is reco (i.e., a record object).\nHere is an overview of the reco type2:\n\nThis type is used as the type of the properties property for the item class, and the type of the with properties parameters of the duplicate and make commands.\n\nTo display the contents of parameters in Automator's corresponding \"Results\" pane for that specific action, simply use:\nreturn parameters\n\nWhat, specifically, does parameters contain?\nI was curious what exactly is meant by, \"settings made in the action’s user interface,\" so I took a look at the contents of parameters. I learned that, unlike input, parameters only contains information about that specific action, not any information regarding the preceding action. \nBy using the following line of code,\ndisplay dialog length of parameters\n\nI also discovered that the number of properties in parameters for a \"Run AppleScript\" action in Automator is three.\nThey are:\n|temporary items path|:\n\nwhere |temporary items path| is followed by the file path of the temporary folder created to store temporary data that may be created by the currently running \"Run AppleScript\" action. This folder is necessarily created upon run, even if the code does not create any temporary data. After the \"Run AppleScript\" action has completed, this folder and its parent folder are immediately deleted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that |temporary items path| differs from (path to temporary items).\n\n\n*\n\n*return POSIX path of (path to temporary items) produces:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\"/private/var/folders/p9/q_5_fbld7qzdmz6htfqjcxhw0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/\"\n\n\n\n*return |temporary items path| of parameters produces:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\"/var/folders/p9/q_5_fbld7qzdmz6htfqjcxhw0000gn/T/1BD6446F-5501-42E5-A002-29588DFF8BD8/1/com.apple.Automator.RunScript\"\n\n\n\n*While both folders reside within the \"T\" folder, the difference between these two folders is that the |temporary items path| folder, as well as its parent folder, are deleted upon completion of the \"Run AppleScript\" action (i.e., this folder is action-specific), while the path to temporary items folder is never deleted and can be viewed even when the AppleScript is not running.\n\nignoresInput:\n\nwhere ignoresInput is either true or false, depending on whether the \"Ignore this action's input\" box found in the Options tab beneath that action in Automator is either ticked or unchecked.\nsource:\n\nwhere source contains the unabridged AppleScript code of that \"Run AppleScript\" action.\nHow does one read the contents of parameters within an AppleScript?\nSince the type of parameters is not list, one cannot simply:\nset firstParameter to item 1 of parameters\n\nas this will produce an error. But, you can convert parameters to a list object:\nset parametersInListFormat to (parameters as list)\n\nThen, you'll be able to execute something like this:\nset individualItemFrom_parametersInListFormat to \"\"\n\nrepeat with individualItemFrom_parametersInListFormat in parametersInListFormat\n    display dialog individualItemFrom_parametersInListFormat\nend repeat\n\nAlternatively, you can skip the conversion to a list and read the contents of parameters simply like so1:\nset item1 to |temporary items path| of parameters\nset item2 to |ignoresInput| of parameters\nset item3 to source of parameters\n\n\nTo where exactly does the AppleScript return the input to?\nThe input of the current action is sent to the next action as that action's input.\nMore info on the return statement3:\n\nA return statement exits a handler and optionally returns a specified value. Execution continues at the place in the script where the handler was called.\nIf a handler does not include a return statement, AppleScript returns the value returned by the last statement. If the last statement doesn’t return a value, AppleScript returns nothing.\nWhen AppleScript has finished executing a handler (that is, when it executes a return statement or the last statement in the handler), it passes control to the place in the script immediately after the place where the handler was called. If a handler call is part of an expression, AppleScript uses the value returned by the handler to evaluate the expression.\n\n\nHow might these variables be ideally employed in an AppleScript application/service?\nNow that I better understand the positional parameters of input and parameters, it is easier for me to imagine their practical value.\ninput:\nThe value of input is conspicuous and the possibilities for its implementation are immeasurable.\nOne very basic application would be if you want to pass a string of text that a user enters in a dialog box via an \"Ask for Text\" action to the next action, a \"Run AppleScript\" action that writes this string to file. Here is what this might look like:\n\n\nparameters:\nGiven that parameters is limited to that specific action and does not contain any data from previous actions, and the data that it does contain isn't necessarily relevant, it is much less useful and flexible  than input. I can visualize the need for |temporary items path|, but I am unable to do so for the other two properties.\nHere is an example of how one might need to reference |temporary items path| in their AppleScript:\n\n\n*\n\n*Say that one wanted an Automator application to display to the user the dimensions of a web image.\n\n\n*\n\n*The user could use |temporary items path| as a location to store that image, so that the code could operate on it. Then, upon completion, since the user does not need or want the image saved to disk, the AppleScript would automatically delete that image (or, more specifically, the AppleScript would automatically delete the folder that contains the folder that contains that image).\n\n*Here is how this might be implemented:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set theURLofImage to \"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/company/img/logos/se/se-logo.png\"\n    set tempFolderThatIsAutomaticallyDeletedAfterRun to |temporary items path| of parameters\n    set filename to \"StackExchangeLogo.png\"\n    set fullFilepath to tempFolderThatIsAutomaticallyDeletedAfterRun & \"/\" & filename\n\n\n\n    -- Saving image from internet to disk.\n    -- From: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21491446/7138483    \n    do shell script \"curl -f \" & theURLofImage & \" -o \" & fullFilepath\n\n\n\n    -- Figuring out the dimensions of the saved image.\n    -- From: https://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/imageevents/01.html\n    try\n        tell application \"Image Events\"\n            launch\n            set this_image to open fullFilepath\n            -- Extract the properties record.\n            set the props_rec to the properties of this_image\n            -- Purge the open image data.\n            close this_image\n            -- Extract the property value from the record.\n            copy (dimensions of props_rec) to {x, y}\n            set the image_info to \"Dimensions of \" & filename & \": \" & \"\" & x & \" x \" & y\n        end tell\n        display dialog image_info\n    on error error_message\n        display dialog error_message\n    end try\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\n\n*Also, one might want to monitor the size of the |temporary items path| folder, to impose a limitation, so that if its size surpasses a certain value, an error is presented to the user.\nIn terms of how |ignoresInput| might be used, one could change the |ignoresInput| setting mid-code, with the following line:\nset |ignoresInput| of parameters to true\n\nOne might want to arrange their code so that if the input meets or does not meet some condition, then the input should be ignored. For example:\nif item 1 of input > 10 then\n        set |ignoresInput| of parameters to true\nend if\n\nBut, even if one did want to make sure that the input was only utilized if its contents met some condition, one could accomplish this same effect without having to read or alter the |ignoresInput| value; instead, one could simply declare their own boolean value for this purpose. So, I still think that the applicability of the |ignoresInput| parameter is questionable.\nSimilarly, I can't think of any particularly compelling reasons why one would need to read or modify the source parameter of their AppleScript while it runs.\n\nWhat else?\nOne area of confusion for me still exists.\nI still don't understand why Apple, in its documentation, advises against not returning anything in an AppleScript1:\n\nThe template code finally returns input as its output; your action should always return something as output, even if it what [sic] is given it as input.\n\nWhat's the harm of removing the return statement from one's AppleScript, if one does not need it?\nIf someone familiar with AppleScript methodology can address this matter for me, please drop a comment.\nIt is possible that I am misinterpreting the sentence.\nI am interpreting this sentence to mean:\n\"When writing your code, you should always make sure to include a return statement somewhere in your code.\"\nBut, the sentence could potentially mean instead:\n\"If you put a return statement in your code, that return statement is designed to always return something. If you don't assign anything to input, then the code will simply return the same input that it received.\"\nThe ambiguity revolves around the original intent of the word, should, and whether the should is meant to act as a recommendation for the user writing an AppleScript, or whether, by should, they meant will.\n\nSources for passages included in this answer:\n1.

I have an SSD, and I am using a SATA to USB 3 adapter (basically an enclosure, as it is called) to connect it to my laptop. This worked fine with a mid-2012 MacBook Pro. \nI tried to use this SSD with with a retina late 2012 MacBook Pro, only to find that it wasn't recognized at all by the MacBook. It didn't show up in the Finder, in Disk Utility, or even in the \"System Information\" USB section. It seemed as though it wasn't even connected. The USB ports on the MacBook are functional.\nI tried formatting it with macOS Journaled, exFAT, and even NTFS, but to no avail. I decided to see if this would happen with other MacBooks. I connected it to another retina MacBook Pro, and it wasn't recognized. I connected it to a MacBook Air, and it was. When I formatted it to exFAT I connected it to a Windows computer, and it was recognized (and that's how I tried formatting it as an NTFS drive).\nAs some additional information, when I connect the SSD to the MacBook Pro, the enclosure light lights up, meaning that power definitely goes to it. However, it doesn't blink at all (which would suggest some operations were going on). \nSo from this, although I haven't tested an exhaustive list of computers, it seems as though the SSD won't work with newer, retina MacBooks. Is there any explanation for this? Is there any way in which I could make it work again? Is there a problem with my SSD, the adaptor, the USB 3.0 Micro-B 10 Pin to USB 3.0 Type A wire that I am using? Or is there a problem with newer MacBooks in general which don't allow such SSDs to be connected to the laptop with this adapter (which seems like the most likely of these)? Are there any drivers I need to install for it to work? (This doesn't sound likely, though). \nHas anyone here had any luck with connecting an external SSD to their (retina) MacBook Pro?\nRunning diskutil list after connecting the external SSD, as was suggested by Allan in the comments, gives this output:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            120.5 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            Macintosh HD           +120.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n                                 Unencrypted\n\nThis is the same output that I get when I don't have the SSD connected.\n\nA: It seems like, since the SSD is not recognized at all, and:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB ports fully function\n\n*The SSD fully functions (with older Macs and Windows computers),\n\n\nthe only conclusion to come to is that the adapter uses drivers which are not present in newer MacBooks. Even if the old and new MacBooks are on the latest version of macOS (Sierra as of writing this), there is some connection between the adapter and the hardware you are trying it on.\nSolution: use a different adapter (this solved my problem!)\n\nMany thanks to Allan for his help resolving this issue.

Will it be store decrypted? I have encrypted my hard drive with FileVault.\nIf I will manually create a backup by copying to some external hard drive - how will the information on this external one be stored?\n\nA: It will be stored as plain files; FileVault encryption only protects files when thy're on your startup volume. You can encrypt the external drive if you want. You can also create an encrypted disk image, store the image on the external disk, and then store files inside the encrypted image. But unless you do something to encrypt the files, they'll be freely readable from the external disk.\nBTW, the same is true of Apple's Time Machine backup system -- backing up a FileVault-protected Mac results in an unencrypted backup unless you choose the option to encrypt the backup.\n\nA: FileVault doesn't encrypt single files but whole volumes. So after unlocking the volume the files itselves appear as not encrypted. Copying the files (as part of a backup) will save them unencrypted on a normal backup volume. Copying them to an encrypted but unlocked backup volume will save them also as \"not encrypted\". After locking the encrypted backup volume they are safe again though.\n\nA: Files are not encrypted with FileVault, the disk is encrypted and it's not always easy to understand the difference.\nBut what it means, in practice, is if you copy a file from a FileVault-protected drive on your Mac to an external drive:\n1) which is not FileVault-protected,\n - the file will be accessible on your Mac\n - the file will be accessible on any other machine (Mac/PC) which you might connect the external drive to.\n2) which is FileVault-protected\n - the file will be accessible on your Mac\n - the file will NOT be accessible by another party who, with/without your permission moves/steals the drive\n - the file MAY be accessible by you on another Mac, but you will need a password (I'm just not sure which one)\n", "Q: What is this menubar icon with NW-SE double-headed arrow?

I want to add my Downloads folder to my iCloud Drive so that it can sync just like Sierra syncs with the Documents and Desktop folder.\nCan this be done?\n\nA: You could create an 'Alias' of your 'Downloads' folder and move it to iCloud Drive. \nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Finder and locate your 'Downloads' folder\n\n*Right-click on your 'Downloads' folder and select 'Make Alias'\n\n*Drag the new alias to 'iCloud Drive' in the Finder sidebar (You'll notice the animated pie graph icon filling up to the right of 'iCloud Drive' in the Finder window as it syncs)\n\n\nYou can now remove the word 'Alias' from the name of the folder in iCloud drive if you'd like. There is no real technical reason for it to be there other than to remind you that it's an alias and not the original folder.\n\nA: Here's how I did it on mine.\nYou have to understand that as of September 24, 2017, iCloud only allows Desktop and Documents folder to stored on iCloud. Eg. you cannot select yet additional folders you want to be synced to iCloud.\nSo, I chose to sync my Downloads folder by storing it in Documents folder because had I put it in iCloud-synced Desktop folder, the Downloads folder would be visible on my Desktop.\nThe Downloads folder is protected by macOS from changes (such as a rename on Finder), but if you can use the Terminal app to circumvent this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, and go to iCloud-synced Documents folder\n\n*Manually create a folder named Downloads\n\n*Move all your files in the original Downloads folder into this newly created Downloads folder located under Documents folder\n\n*Create a symbolic link for the newly-created Downloads folder (keyboard shortcut is: Command + L). It will be automatically be named Downloads alias by macOS\n\n*Put the newly-created Download alias under your home directory. Eg. /Users/your-user-name\n\n*Using the Terminal app, delete Downloads folder\n\n*Now, you can rename Downloads alias as Downloads\nNow, all files saved through Downloads (alias) will be stored under iCloud-synced Documents/Downloads folder.\n\nA: Similar answer to one of the others, but in this case I've used a symbolic link to do this rather than use the GUI to create an apple 'Alias', just to be sure it works in all cases.\nRather than add the original Downloads folder into iCloud, I've relied on the standard 'Documents and Desktop' sync option provided by Apple in iCloud without messing around in the background where those files are accessible (~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/) as I'm not confident that adding links in there is a good idea long term.\nIn terminal (or iTerm2 if you want a more customisable terminal):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a 'Downloads' folder in your 'Documents' directory (if you haven't already): mkdir ~/Documents/Downloads\n\n*Copy (or move as with this example) your files from the old (presumed to be in ~/Downloads directory to the new Downloads directory: mv ~/Downloads ~/Documents/Downloads\n\n*Delete your old Downloads folder (this should require your password, and presumes you are logged in as an administrator): sudo rm -rf ~/Downloads/\n\n*Create a symbolic link to your new Downloads folder: ln -s ~/Documents/Downloads ~/Downloads\nAll those commands again, but without all the extra words :)\nmkdir ~/Documents/Downloads\nmv ~/Downloads ~/Documents/Downloads\nsudo rm -rf ~/Downloads/\nln -s ~/Documents/Downloads ~/Downloads\n\nYou will probably have to drag the new Downloads link (or folder) in Finder to the Favourites section/left menu if you want it to display there once more.\n\nA: Using Aliases and Symbolic Links may not work.  On one of my Mac's, Finder replaced the symbolic link with an empty folder upon reboot.  The only way I've been able to consistently do this is to create a directory hard-link.  This is not possible with the default OS X command line as ln won't work if you're doing a hard-link to directories.\nIn order to do this, you need to install Brew and install the hardlink-osx package.  Though, before doing so one should consult this question from Ask Ubuntu, as I think this function is disabled in all versions of the ln command.  Now, I had issues even with a hard link because the operating system did not notify the sync agent that a file in ~/Documents/Downloads had been altered because the OS call to the file system was for ~/Downloads and sometimes the sync finder extension did not seem to let the iCloud sync engine know there were changes to upload when a new file was downloaded or modified.\n\nA: preferences>icloud>options and check the box for \"Desktop & Documents Folders\"\nDrag \"Downloads\" onto the desktop. \nDone!\n", "Q: Is there a way to register more fingerprints for TouchID on a MacBook? It seems strange to me I can only register 3 finger prints for TouchID on my new 2016 MacBook Pro.  \nIs there any way to get macOS to allow for more?\nNote: I know with iPhones you could fool it by alternating fingers back and forth while registering them and may try that, but 3 just seem bizarrely limiting.\nPreempting the person that asks why? I place my MacBook on a rain stand regularly to the left of my external monitor and it'd be easier to use my left had to reach the sensor...  coupled with the face that I occasionally do things (usually twisting copper wires) the chews up the finger prints on my index finger...  all together it'd be nice to register middle, index and thumb on BOTH hands.   \n\nA: One option it to alternate fingers back and forth while registering them. \nie. place your right index one press, then right middle one press, then right index again for one press, etc... Do that the same when you get to the edges. You'll be able to unlock using either finger stored in a single memory location.\nI currently use this, it does work, I've heard of people registering several finger prints to a single location on iOS. I'd rather register them discretely though, hence why I asked this question.\nI suspect it's accuracy goes down as the number of finger prints goes up, but I haven't seen that with just two prints on one memory slot. \n", "Q: Unable to install Snow Leopard from original disks I own an iMac that was recently updated in error by a family member (I've forgiven them). This was a disaster because some of my hardware and software no longer work! Previously this iMac was running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. So, I decided to install Snow Leopard again. I have the original disks (remember those things) that came with the computer but cannot install Snow Leopard. I have wasted two whole days on this and am now desperate.\nMy specs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Late 2009 iMac\n\n*27\" model\n\n*16GB RAM\n\n*Apple Wireless Keyboard\n\n*Magic Mouse\n\n*Mac OS X 10.11.6 installed :(\n\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting into Recovery Mode, from both the local HD and internet, but my Mac doesn't seem to support this?\n\n*Installing Snow Leopard from original Apple iMac grey disks that shipped with the computer\n\n*Installing Snow Leopard from a retail version of Snow Leopard (borrowed from a friend)\n\n*Verified the optical drive is working fine (it reads CDs/DVDs and burns DVDs fine)\n\n*Verified that booting from the optical drive is fine (booted from a Prosoft Data Rescue II CD)\n\n*Followed the steps outlined at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/upgrading-your-mac-to-snow-leopard-using-your-usb-drive/ to create a bootable installation USB.

I have a function on February 19 to prepare for and I require Snow Leopard for compatibility with some specialized software/hardware. \nPleeeeeeaaase can someone help me? Pretty please with sugar on top…!!! :)\n\nA: Depending on when you bought your iMac, it came pre-installed with either Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.1 (10A2155) or 10.6.2 (10C2234). It is one of these versions that will be on the original discs you refer to and, based on your lack of success with the retail copy, it is also one of these versions your friend must have as well.\nNow, the reason your iMac isn't booting from any of these is that it can no longer run any version of Mac OS X before Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3.\nWhy?\nWell, the key issue here is that your iMac is one of the quad core models. These were options for the 27\" model only and both variants (i.e. the i5 and i7 versions) had a firmware update. Because of your music requirements (as expressed to me via Comments), I am 99.9% certain you installed this firmware update (which Apple recommended all users do anyway).\nIt is this update that is preventing you to boot from your Snow Leopard discs because the firmware update itself requires as a minimum Snow Leopard (10.6.3). The installers you're trying to use are for Snow Leopard 10.6.1 or 10.6.2.\nSolution\nIMPORTANT: This solution is based on your comment that you have backups of all your files etc. Proceeding with this will reformat your hard drive - so proceed carefully and ensure you have a current backup!\nYou can use Target Disk Mode to get around your problem. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Borrow your friend's MacBook Pro and ensure it and your iMac are both switched off\n\n*Connect the two computers together via a FireWire cable\n\n*Start your iMac in Target Disk Mode by holding down the T key on your iMac keyboard immediately after starting up. Keep the key down until you see the icon floating around the screen.\n\n*Start the MBP\n\n*Once booted, your iMac's hard drive will appear on the MBP desktop just like any external hard drive would.\n\n*Insert the Snow Leopard retail disk into the MBP and follow the prompts to install Snow Leopard. Ensure you select the iMac hard drive as the install location - DO NOT select the MBP hard drive or you'll have a very unhappy friend!\n\n*When the installation is complete, reboot the MBP again and immediately hold down the Option key. When prompted to select a statup disk, select the iMac's drive and hit Enter.\n\n*You're now booting the MBP from your iMac hard drive.\n\n*Once booted, use the Apple Menu > Software Update option to install updates.\n\n*Keep installing updates until you have at least Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 (the first version which includes the Mac App Store).\n\n*Once you're running Mac OS X 10.6.6, shut down the MBP and switch off your iMac.\n\n*Disconnect the FireWire cable from the two Macs.\n\n*Reboot your iMac and update/install whatever software you need to get it working as you want.\n\n*Copy/migrate across any files etc from your backup.\n\n*Crisis averted!\n\n\nObviously the above steps will take some time, but let me know if you run into any problems.\nAs an aside, if you don't have access to a FireWire cable, or your friend doesn't want to lend you their MBP, you could try Kent's suggestion in the comments.

Apple care didn't find any issue first time but second time they admit there is a hardware issue in my Macbook and they replaced it.

I had to print a A4 paper with a detailed description (told them issue happen when put in a sd card and then take it out) and screenshot of diagnosis page showing SD Card error in diagnosis boot page (because for some reasons, it was randomly showing that error and apparently when I give my Macbook for first repair, it passed test 100% successfully) Reception who receive my Macbook, she didn't really reflect things I told to her to technician.

At first, after some inactivity (about 30 second to a minute) the dashboard and the shut down prompt would pop up. I got the dashboard to stop popping up by changing the settings, where it was set to pop up with f12, I changed it to f19. Boom the dashboard stopped coming up, but the little box that asked \"are you sure you would like to shut your computer down\" keeps coming up. \nNow then my dad has replaced the battery, the hard drive, and reinstalled the os (which is snow leopard btw.) I ran the ASD, which was crazy to pull off, and the only thing that came back was a temp sensor- palm rest L test 1 - unable to read sensor. I would think though if that was the problem, that it was force shut down the mac, which it doesn't. Like I said before the prompt only comes up after inactivity, if I kept the eject button pressed down, the prompt doesn't pop up. Also if I keep the prompt on the screen and don't do anything after about 5 minutes, the mac makes a slight sound like the sound a computer makes if you keep a button pressed for too long. It has never done a forced shutdown on its own though. \nSo, I should tell you now, this is the first mac I've got down and dirty into. That being said I like to think I'm slightly above average, when it comes to computers and electronics. My gut (the microsoft guy in me as well) is telling me to do a complete format and reinstall (like you would do on a new pc.) My dad tells me you can't do that, though I haven't really looked into it. So I started looking into standard settings, power saver, screen saver, anything I could get to from the gui. I couldn't find anything that stuck out. I tried doing the option, command, p, r, and power button thing, however I saw that there are supposed to be three beeps, I only got one. Also didn't work. I did a couple of things in the terminal. Mostly to do with pmset command. I noticed when I did the command \"sudo pmset -c powerbutton 0\" nothing happened so I set the powerbutton to 1, I was under the assumption that when I did that the power button on the mac would send the computer to sleep. It didn't, the regular shut down prompt pops up, both after the button and after inactivity. \nOh, I just remembered I had a problem with being unable to unmount my flash drive, when trying to restore it. I had to go into the terminal and force unmount it. After I did I didn't have anymore troubles. Also it was having some difficulties loading disks, like after putting the disk in, it would try to read it and would kick it out after 30 seconds or so. I dunno if these have anything to do with the problem at hand though.\nSo help a brother out here, this macbook is supposed to be a gift to my aunt.

I've installed in end 2015 a frash mac osx. I setted up the firmware password and never used again. Until today. The problem is: I forgot that. I know that I can go to an Apple Store or a certified shop and have it restored, but this requires me a lot of time (I'm far away from Apple Store and the neares shop told me they have to keep it for 10 days beacuse they have other pc to repair first..).\nMy goal is to reinstall a fresh Mac OSX (I do every year). Is this possible without having the firmware password? I usually do the Command+R and the proceed from there, but I can't beacuse I don't remember the password. \nI was wondering: if I download sierra installation can I run a fresh installation and erase all data?\nPS: With the find my phone I can reset pc, but can I also reset the firmware password (I dubpt so)\n\nA: There is nothing nicer than a fresh install, and the FW password was also an obstacle for me on my Mid-2012 Mac. After tinkering, I was able to erase my Mac to factory default and fresh install, but, this method does not reset the FW password. \nYou will need: \n- An internet connection\n- A second apple device connected to an Apple ID \n- Your Mac, connected to the same Apple ID with Find My Mac enabled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iCloud \"Find My Mac\"\n\n*Using another device, locate your Mac and find the \"erase\" option. \n\n*Once your Mac has been erased, you should be taken to the recovery menu by default where you are able to install a fresh version of MacOS without the FW password.\n\n\nThis method will erase and restore your Mac to factory defaults, as if it were just out the box!\nThis was also my ultimate goal (security paranoia) and was relieved I did not have to go to apple and wait 10+ days for repair. \nUnfortunately, after days of googling, tinkering and having faith I would be the first to break the code.... I do not think there is anyway to reset the FirmWare PW unless you visit Apple. \n\nA: \"Find my iPhone\"->\"Erase Mac\" locks a MacBook with a firmware password.\nMacBook 2015 shows a black screen with white crossed-circle symbol (not the recovery menu) after it is erased.\n\nA: OSXDaily says you can do it by booting into recovery mode.  If that is true, then setting the password in the first place was a complete waste of time.\niMacs from way back when would reset it by a button on the main logic board.  If that is no longer possible, try this slightly more involved hack.\n", "Q: How to replace missing root and intermediate certificates in Mac OS X v10.8 Let me preface this with the fact that I know nothing about networking / security / etc.  Twice now, I've had issues with root certificates not working and throwing errors, even though they are still valid.\nHere's the link to my last post that was was fixed after an update to the OS (at this point, I cannot update any further, as my system is frozen based on older software that requires it).\nSafari can't verify the identity of the website errors\nNow, the same issue happened again and I can't figure out what to do.  I've been worried that this is a MiTM attack, but didn't know what to do to fix it at this point. I deleted the key in question that had a red x next to it in Keychain and tried to reinstall the keys through Pacifist, but its still not working (also, I dont see the Key now after using the Pacifist method, so I'm not sure how to get it back, but the websites are still throwing errors.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions to fix the issue (as I would like to safely get into some websites that requires this), or a solution to the overall problem, I would be EXTREMELY happy (I will be offering reputation points as soon as the option is open or will send directly, if its possible to do, if someone helps me to fix this sooner than that).\nI'm on OS 10.8.5 currently.\nEDIT:\nI installed it and it now says, under \"InCommon RSA Standard Assurance Client CA\" - This certificate was signed by an unknown authority.\" I also have 3 to 4 other login certificates that are showing errors, each one of them has some sort of message about the \"InCommon RSA Standard Assurance Client CA.\"  Strangely, theres another certificate that is showing no errors that is signed by the InCommon RSA Standard Assurance CLient CA, but with a different expiration date.  I'm lost.  I can post photos of all the errors if necessary.\nUPDATE:\nUpgraded from 10.8.5 to 10.10.5.  Certificate issues still persist.\n\nA: One should never delete a Root Certificate.\nAnd you should never delete a Root Certificate that has been Marked as Invalid before its expiration Date has been reached.\nThere was a reason why it was marked as invalid.\nMostly because the Issuer of the Certificate mark it as invalid (this could have been done because he got hacked or whatever could have compromised his Root Certificate).\nNow you/your Browser don't have the Root Certificate so you/your Browser aren't able to validate any Certificate which is trusted by this Root.\nSo it depends on the Browser and how it handles Certificates of a Root it doesn't know.\nIf the Browser acts correct he will show you each Certificate based on this Root as invalid but some Browsers (at least in Past) didn't handle this correct and would have shown Certificates without a Root they know as valid.\n\nA: My first best option would be to back up your files, wipe the machine entirely and reinstall the operating system from known good media. Especially since you say this issue has been going on for a while and you are unable to recall all the changes you've made. This is the fastest, safest option.\nIf that isn't an option, then you need to download and replace all the root certificates that were deleted. Find a machine that you trust and use it to download the root or intermediate certificates from trustworthy sites. Each time you get a message saying \"...signed by an untrusted issuer\" you need to locate the certificate that was used to sign it, download it and install it. That is the only way to get rid of these errors. Sorry but there is no quick fix that is going to undo this damage.\nLastly, I would seriously, strongly recommend updating to the most recent version of macOS that will install on your Mac. You seem to be concerned about security. Running an operating system that Apple stopped patching (i.e. abandoned) in August 2015 isn't a good idea. If you are stuck using 10.8.5 because pieces of software haven't been updated it is time to drop them or even post question(s) here looking for help either getting them working on newer versions of macOS or finding replacements.\n\nA: Download and install the AddTrust External CA Root which is linked from  Comodo.\n\nA: I understand you want to fix your Apple certificates and I´m sorry you are having problems.  First off you need to understand what certificates were intended for originally and what they have become in the new modern economy of corporate driven 3d proxy internet.  A certificate is a text file that usually has 1024 2048 etc. Characters.  In other words, root and user certificates are just two separate text files that maintain a mathematical relationship.\nGo ahead and compare the certificate installation process for Google Android Studio and Xcode iTunes Submit.  With Xcode you need a whole inter-department banana farm of certificate garbage at Apple to get up-and-running.  Google is a download and click.\nNow I hate to tell you this but you need to break the certificate engine inside OSX with a linux patch because the only way the root certificate at apple will build pyramid math to approve your certificate is if your mac is under warranty.\nAlso keep in mind if you are within the United Kingdom it is illegal to participate in a planned obsolescence plan such as Apples illegal misuse of data certs as blacklisting technology.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Download Firefox, it has its own CA Root certificates store.\n", "Q: OS X Syriac script/font not rendered OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\nViewing webpages with syriac characters, e. g.

I am experiencing trouble trying to get the combination of Qt 5.8.0 / PyQt 5.7.1 / sip 4.19 / Python3.5 to install & work correctly on my macOS 10.12.2 (Sierra).\nSteps to reproduce the problem: \n(I am being very specific for if anyone else will ever venture here trying to accomplish the same thing) \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Python3.5 via homebrew (brew install python3.5).\n\n*Installing PyQt5 via homebrew however did not work as my python code complained that it could not find the pyqt module. I fixed it by applying some symlinks. Yet, the code remained buggy throwing up errors like QtGui.QApplication was missing etc. I also found multiple complains of macOS users that had run into similar problems but I could not find any real solution. So, I removed all my symlinks and ran brew uninstall pyqt5.\n\n*Then I found this gist on GitHub, and started following that so I:\n\n*Downloaded qt-opensource-mac-x64-clang-5.8.0.dmg from qt-project.org\n\n*Downloaded SIP and PyQt5-gpl sources as mentioned in the gist. \n\n*I then unpacked the SIP & PyQt5 tar files. Then I executed the command: \npython3.5 ~/Downloads/sip-4.19/configure.py -d /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages --arch x86_64\n\n\n*So far, so good. Also make, sudo make install & sudo make clean, as mentioned in the gist, executed without a problem. \n\n*Now, I arrived at step nr. 13 from the gist, which told me to make a small change to the !host_build command listed in the ~/Qt5.8.0/5.8/clang_64/mkspecs/qdevice.pri file. The file  however did not mention any !host_build comment at all, so I added one myself.\n\n*Then, at step 15 from the gist I executed:\npython3.5 configure.py --destdir /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages --qmake ~/Qt5.8.0/5.8/clang_64/bin/qmake\n\n\n*This gave a SDK path error, which I fixed by running sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer as per instruction on this post on Stack from people that ran into a similar problem. \n\n*Now, the code mentioned above in step 10 did execute, but it threw up an error: \n\nError: This version of PyQt5 and the commercial version of Qt have incompatible licenses\n\n\n*So, I searched and arrived at a post on the QT forum. It helped me solve the error by making some small adjustments to PyQt5's configure.py file (commenting out the license check). \n\n*Then, I was finally able to successfully run the command I mentioned at step 10 (step 15 from the gist). \n\n*However, when I tried to run make again, everything seems to be going perfect until it now throws out this error that, so far, I have not been able to fix:\n~/Downloads/PyQt5_gpl-5.7.1/QtCore/sipQtCoreQt.cpp:1093:62: error: no member named 'WindowCancelButtonHint' in namespace 'Qt'; did you mean\n      'WindowCloseButtonHint'?\n    {sipName_WindowCancelButtonHint, static_cast<int>( ::Qt::WindowCancelButtonHint), 419},\n                                                       ~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n    WindowCloseButtonHint\n../../../Qt5.8.0/5.8/clang_64/lib/QtCore.framework/Headers/qnamespace.h:300:9: note: 'WindowCloseButtonHint' declared here\n        WindowCloseButtonHint = 0x08000000,\n        ^\n~/Downloads/PyQt5_gpl-5.7.1/QtCore/sipQtCoreQt.cpp:1106:58: error: no member named 'WindowOkButtonHint' in namespace 'Qt'\n    {sipName_WindowOkButtonHint, static_cast<int>( ::Qt::WindowOkButtonHint), 419},\n                                                   ~~~~~~^\n2 errors generated.\nmake[1]: *** [sipQtCoreQt.o] Error 1\nmake: *** [sub-QtCore-make_first-ordered] Error 2\n\nIs there anyone able to help me out?\n\nA: I am the one who did the Qt5 5.8.0 upgrade for Homebrew. This is a known problem that will persist until Riverbank upgrades their software. I suggest you contact them on their mailing list.\nUPDATE: As a temporary workaround, I've added a qt@5.7 formula, and updated the PyQt5 formula to depend on it.

If you checked the checkbox, your iPhone encrypted backup password was saved in your Keychain files. So you can open the Keychain to show the encryption password once you forget it. \nIf you did not check that \"Remember this password in my Keychain\" option, your iPhone backup password would not be saved in your Keychain.

Opera works just fine, but Safari refuses to play nicely and I can't figure out why.\nI have two profiles, the \"default\" profile that Foxmarks originally created (mobile.foxmarks.com) and one that I created (Profile 1).  Both have the identical bookmarks in them at this point, as shown in my.xmarks.com.\nUnfortunately, Safari keeps somehow finding my old bookmarks from years ago that are a complete mess, and re-downloading them into the browser.  The only positive is that I have disabled Automatic Synchronization in XMark's preferences for Safari, so that Safari will no longer then corrupt my \"real\" bookmarks in Chrome, Opera, and Firefox, with this ancient data.\nMy solution every time I notice this (seems to be every few weeks), is to force-download to Safari from the server, overwriting the local data.  This works, but of course kinda defeats the purpose of keeping them all in sync (I browse for different purposes in each browser [different projects] and so would like to be able to bookmark in any of them and know that they will all stay in sync).  Ideally I could let Safari auto-sync as well.\nWhy does this keep happening?  Where is Safari even getting this old data, since it's clearly not in my profiles on XMarks?  How can I get Safari to stop this and simply work like all the other browsers do with XMarks?\nUPDATE: \nAfter my most recent re-overwriting of the local bookmarks, I then uploaded from my local machine to the server, overwriting the server bookmrakrs to ensure they should be identical.  A couple hours later I got a popup that says this:\n\nYou restored or uploaded bookmarks from another computer to our\n  servers. You can sync normally (the safest choice), or you can\n  download the server bookmarks, overwriting your local bookmarks. Which\n  do you prefer?\n\nI'm given the choices of Sync, Download, or Cancel.  I took a chance on \"Sync\" and everything seems fine, I don't see the old bookmarks appearing in Safari.\n\nA: I seem to have solved my issue, as it's been quite a while now and the problem has not reappeared.\nFirst I turned off Safari XMarks' option to automatically synchronize, so that it wouldn't mess things up during this process.  Then t had to get my bookmarks in Safari all clean & perfect, and once I had that I manually overwrote the server bookmarks with the copy in Safari.  Since then, my old \"bad\" bookmarks have not reappeared.  I suppose it's possible that Safari is quietly in the background still downloading and overwriting my local with the server bookmarks from time to time, but since the server copy is now correct, if that's happening, I don't notice.\nEverything seems fine now, I can use/update bookmarks in Chrome and Safari and they all stay in sync, though there is a definite lag in time for them to pick up changes made from one another, that's just a fact of the way the software works it seems.\n", "Q: Will an IOS App get deleted/ Remove itself if Developer's license expires? Similar questions have been asked by Developers in regards to availability on the store. My question is, if i buy an app today, 2 months later, the App's developer decides he's not making enough revenue from his app, and doesn't renew his yearly subscription, what happens to the app i bought? \nThanks.\n\nA: According to Apple's developer site, the developer's apps will be removed from the App Store but you can keep it if it's already installed.\n\nIf your Apple Developer Program membership expires, your apps will no longer be available for download and you will not be able to submit new apps or updates. You will lose access to pre-release software, Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, and Technical Support Incidents. However, your apps will still function for users who have already installed or downloaded them, and you will still have access to iTunes Connect and free development resources.\n\nIf you delete the app then you won't be able to re-download it because it would've been removed from the store.\n\nA: Your copy of an app will never be taken from you.\nThis applies to both free and paid apps.   Of course, it will no longer be updated, so if any compatibility issues or bugs arise in the future you will be on your own.\nWhat I don't know, though, is whether or not Apple keeps a copy of the app on its servers for redownload/restore purposes, so if it's an app you really care about I suggest keeping a backup of the .ipa file so that you can restore it manually if you ever need to.\nIf you have a Mac, here's how to make a manual backup (instructions for iTunes 12.5):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes and choose Account → Purchased from the menu bar.\n\n*Click the Apps tab on the top-right corner if necessary.\n\n*Find the app you want to keep a backup of and click its download button if there is one.  On this screenshot, I have already downloaded a copy of Tiny Wings and do not have a local copy of Super Mario Run.\n\nIf you don't see the app in the list, try switching between \"All\" and \"Not In My Library.\"\nThere's also a handy \"Download All\" button in the lower-right corner.\n\n*Once it's downloaded, it will be captured and saved in the next Time Machine backup.\n\n*If you want to get to the actual .ipa file, it's saved in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications.\n\n\n", "Q: What camera does the 6th-generation iPod touch have? Given that the 6th-generation iPod touch gets its A8 processor from 2014's iPhone 6, it seems likely that other components were improved as well.  Was the camera upgraded to the component used in the iPhone 6 (including the sapphire lens, even?), or is it carry-over from the 5th generation (released in 2012 with components from the iPhone 5)? \nI looked at Wikipedia and the iFixit teardowns and I'm having a hard time reconciling the apparently contradictory information.  Anybody able to make some sense of this?\n5th-generation iFixit teardown\n6th-generation iFixit teardown \niPod touch (Wikipedia)\n\nA: It is simply neither the iPhone 6 camera nor the 5th generation iPod Touch camera.\nThe 6th generation iPod Touch has a camera of its own. Some specs are similar to the iPhone 6 camera, but not all. The camera was upgraded from 5 Mpixel on the 5th Gen to 8 Mpixel on the 6th gen - similar to the iPhone 6. On the other hand, the camera does not have the sapphire crystal lens cover and auto image stabilization features that the iPhone 6 has.\n", "Q: Is there a way to configure the wireless keyboard to control the keyboard light? My Macbook Pro has a lit keyboard.\nI can change the intensity of the keyboard light using Fn F5/F6 on the Macbook's keyboard.\nMy Apple Wireless Keyboard, Third generation (A1314), has no markings on F5/F6 for changing the keyboard light.\nSure enough, pressing Fn F5/F6 on the wireless keyboard does not affect the keyboard light.\n(Fortunately, changing the Macbook's display intensity and volume both work fine on the wireless keyboard, where the inscriptions on the keyboard say they should.)\nIs there a way to configure the wireless keyboard to control the keyboard light?\n\nA: You would think this would be a simple task, such as simply designating a shortcut to a specific key combination for this action from System Preferences, but unfortunately it's not an option. You may have noticed that the actions themselves (dim, increase brightness, toggle backlight on/off) are not included in the 'Shortcuts' list in 'System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts' and therefore there isn't a way to configure them natively within the settings/preferences of OS X/macOS. \nI have heard of a third party program called LabTick that has helped to resolve this issue with users in the past, but it was developed for older operating systems and warns against it being unstable on a newer OS. I have confirmed the instability myself by installing it on macOS Sierra 10.12.2; the first time I launched it, it quit unexpectedly while trying to configure the shortcuts. When I was finally able to configure the shortcuts, they did not work for me even after trying multiple different key combinations.\n", "Q: Automating pfctl to block incoming connections and IPs I get a lot of unwanted traffic from Chinese IP addresses. I'm using an old Mac with OS X 10.7.5 (my Mac is ancient, so I cannot update further), so I imagine it's more vulnerable than a newer Mac would be. \nThis page gave an excellent tutorial about how to use pfctl to detect sshd \"attackers\" who violate certain rules and add them to a blacklist. In my naive understanding, this applies only to sshd connections. \nHow can I generalize that tutorial to block other kinds of traffic as well? In particular, I have unwanted traffic involving sshd, sshd-keygen-wrapper, and screensharingd, though I'd love to block any traffic that has too many simultaneous connections or too many attempts within a certain amount of time. \n\nA: You can simply replace:\ntable <attackers> persist\nblock log quick from <attackers>\npass in quick proto tcp from any port ssh flags S/SA keep state (max-src-conn 3, max-src-conn-rate 5/60, overload <attackers> flush global)\n\nwith:\ntable <attackers> persist\nblock log quick from <attackers>\npass in quick proto tcp from any flags S/SA keep state (max-src-conn 3, max-src-conn-rate 5/60,  overload <attackers> flush global)\n\nIf you want to restrict this to single ports use: ... port {22, 443, 5900:5902} ... instead of ... port ssh ....\n", "Q: Multiple AppleIDs across two iMacs I have an old iMac, but also acquired a new one, and now run them both, side by side. I set up the new one to have the same AppleID as my old iMac, which has an enormous amount of music in iTunes. While there are a few iTunes purchases in there, mostly this music is from my CD collection that I imported over the years into iTunes on the old iMac.\nI thought that these would sync, but that music won't appear on the new iMac's iTunes, even though its signed in with the same AppleID credentials.  To confirm the credentials are identical, I can see (for example) that my \"Purchase History\" in iTunes contains identical information on both iMacs.\nSo why is it that my imported CDs (in the original iTunes) can't be seen on my new iMac?   many thanks for any thoughts - very concerned that I'll lose all those old songs, and all the effort it took to import them - I had hoped to migrate it all to the new iMac :(\n\nA: By default, iTunes is not going to copy your Music CD tracks from one Mac to the other, though Apple does offer more than one paid method to have them moved for you.\nThere are free ways too, multiple of them, and this article from Apple goes over some options: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204318\n", "Q: Apple Account Verification Last week I attempted to log into my apple@me.com account and it stated that my account needed verification and is locked.  To verify, I can have an e-mail sent or answer security questions.  The address that the e-mail is being sent to is the very account that I am locked out of.  There are 3 security questions, of which I need two correct.  I only have one correct (it won't tell me which one) and I've exhausted all possible options.  Apple support is telling me that my only option is to figure out the security questions.  Why I appreciate the security, this is an account used for gaming and I refuse to believe that there is no other way I can verify my identity.  I have other accounts linked to this one and they are telling me that that doesn't matter either.  Any options or specific contacts I can reach out to would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: First, check and see if you can log in to your account at appleid.apple.com. Support can help you a lot more if you can log in here, since you can get a support PIN (which acts as a password). \nTell them your support PIN (found at the very bottom of the page) and they will know that it's you and can fix your account with only one security question.\n\nYour Apple ID should also be set up with a non-apple email address, and that should be where you are getting your codes. Check all of you emails, spam folders and all, to make sure you didn't miss an account reset email. Good luck!\n\nA: Bear with me - it can get hard to follow.\nSo the original Apple '@me.com' email addresses were created back when 'MobileMe' was still a thing. You didn't need a 3rd party email address to acquire an '@me.com' email address from Apple like you do now for '@icloud.com' email accounts. A few years ago, Apple transitioned from 'MobileMe' to 'iCloud'. It was a forced transition as after a few months they flipped the switch on the 'MobileMe' servers and you could no longer access the account (or the data stored within the account) unless you followed the migration procedure in the email that they sent you multiple times.\nOne step of this forced-transition was that they requested that you bind a 3rd party email address to your account as either an alternate login or a rescue address (likely for situations such as these), but you may not in fact remember doing it even if you had. If you did follow through with this step though, there may be good news ahead!\nNote: I cannot guarantee that this will work not knowing what details you chose to provide iCloud years ago, but it's worth a shot.\nMy suggestion: Go to iforgot.apple.com and click the blue link that says 'Forgot Apple ID?' It should take you to a screen where it requests your first name, last name, and an email address. Type the 3rd party email address (like hotmail, gmail, outlook, etc) that you would have most likely used let's say, 3-4 years ago. Upon continuing, if it tells you \"No Apple ID Found. We can’t find an Apple ID matching the information provided.\" click 'Try Again'. Continue to enter all of the email addresses you owned as far back as you can remember that even had a slight chance of you using them. If after entering all email addresses you can remember it still has not found one that matches your information, I apologize but my suggestion did not work.\nIf one of the email addresses you provided finds an Apple ID, return to appleid.apple.com and attempt to log in with it using the same password you would use to log in with your '@me.com' account. \nUpon logging in:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it tells you that your password is incorrect, it's actually a\nsecond separate account that you created at some point\n\n*If it lets you log in without telling you that your account is locked\nand needs verification, it's actually a second\nseparate account that you created at some point (and just happened to\nuse the same password); this is not helpful in recovering your main account\n\n*If it lets you log in and gives you the same message that your\naccount is locked and needs verification, and the security questions appear to be the same, this is very likely the same account, and this email address should have also been sent the password reset email (I'm hoping that if you got this far, that you still have access to this email account, otherwise all of this will not have not been helpful)\n\n\nOne last thing to note is, if you ever set up something called a 'Rescue Email Address' this bypasses all other email addresses you associated with the account and the Reset Password email will only be sent to that address.\n", "Q: macOS equivalent to Ubuntu mouse middle button on window title bar to lower window? On Ubuntu it's extremely handy to lower a given window by clicking mouse middle button on title bar \n... is there a macOS equivalent ?\nPS.  to lower a window is simply to keep an open window at current location on desktop and push it to the bottom of all overlapping windows ... the opposite of clicking on title bar of partially shown window to raise it to top most window ... given window may very well be occluded by neighbor windows so not necessarily the top most window holding the window focus ... very different from minimizing a window \n\nA: I believe what you are referencing is the setting in Ubuntu that can be configured called 'Raise window if covered, otherwise lower it.'\nUnfortunately there is no equivalent for this action built into the Mac OS. We have plenty of shortcuts, but not that one.\nThere has been plenty of discussion about this missing feature in past questions like this one, which is broken down a little better for readers in this answer. I'm not marking your question as a duplicate because it's not exactly the same, and we're now dealing with a different OS than they would have been 5 years ago.\nHere are our options:\n\n\n*\n\n*'command + tab' - for cycling through open applications\n\n*'command + `' - for cycling through multiple windows of the active\napplication\n\n*'command + H' - to hide an application (all windows) without minimizing it; handy when you still want to be able to access the window from the application switcher without having to de-minimize it first\n\n\nIf the built in shortcuts of the Mac OS just don't work for what you're trying to accomplish, I suggest looking into a 3rd party solution. I have heard good things about a program called 'Witch' (although I don't use it myself). BetterTouchTool is another that I've seen recommended by many, but there are many on the market that have the ability to program shortcuts (and gestures) for the purpose of cycling through, activating, and handling open applications and/or windows.\n", "Q: What does ~~MULTILATERAL~~ Mean in an imessages text conversation on iPhone? Some of my contacts have multiple points of contact.  A friend and I were trying to get to the bottom of why some messages didn't appear on his ipad, and some didn't appear on my mac.  We both have iphones.  \nOn my mac, I swtiched a conversation from phone number to email address, and the text message one had this one word in caps, surrounded by double tildes\nThe phone number also only shows up as a phone number, but the email address shows up as his name.  Both the email and the phone are part of his contacts.\nA google of imessage iphone and multilateral gives no joy.\nWhat does multilateral mean in this context?\n\nA: 'Multilateral' generally means multiple participants. If your threads aren't group messages, it's likely referring to the fact that the conversation may be acting like there are multiple participants because you have multiple points of contact for each other (email address, phone number, etc).\nI would try following the steps in this article to resolve your issue. If your previous conversations aren't important enough to keep, I would also suggest purging all threads you have for each other on all of your devices before following the steps in the article provided. This just helps with clarity and cutting down on confusion when you begin receiving new messages.\nAlso, sometimes it helps to review the information you have added in the 'You can be reached for messages at' section of the 'Accounts' preferences panel within the Messages app. Ideally, you should only have your iPhone's phone number and the email address that is associated with your Apple ID listed under this section.\n", "Q: terminal script to search CSV file 2 parts to this, can't see where I'm going wrong\nThe 1st part works--get my BSSID through the airport command:\nmyBSSID=\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -I | grep BSSID | awk '{print $2}'\"\n\nthen (this is where I get EOF or syntax errors): \npass that value to awk, which will search a file (APtable.csv) for that string, and give me the adjacent value to it: \nawk -v theBSSID=$myBSSID '$1 == theBSSID {print $2}' '/Users/russell/Desktop/APtable.csv'\n\n\nA: You do not need to pipe to grep and then to awk in the first line as awk can do what's needed by itself. Also the way you have the first line written, it is missing the $(...) around the commands.\nIn the second line you're missing the field separator in the awk command, which in a .csv file normally is a comma. So I added that to the awk command.\nUse the following two lines:\nmyBSSID=\"$(/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -I | awk '/BSSID/{print $2}')\"\nawk -F ',' -v theBSSID=\"$myBSSID\" '$1 == theBSSID {print $2}' \"$HOME/Desktop/APtable.csv\"\n\n\nI noticed the output of the airport command didn't report the BSSID correctly in that if left out some zeros.\nIf that's the case on your system and the .cvs file has proper info, then try the following:\nmyBSSID=\"$(system_profiler SPAirPortDataType | awk '/BSSID/{print $2}')\"\nawk -F ',' -v theBSSID=\"$myBSSID\" '$1 == theBSSID {print $2}' \"$HOME/Desktop/APtable.csv\"\n\nNote that system_profiler SPAirPortDataType isn't as fast as using airport but if the output of airport is dropping some of the zeros, then you'll need an alternative if the BSSID's in the .cvs file have all 12 characters, not counting the colons, which they should.\nThe following could be used to incorporate both methods in a bash script so as to only use the second method if the length of myBSSID is less then 17 characters, as 17 is the correct length.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmyBSSID=\"$(/S*/L*/P*/A*/V*/A/R*/airport -I | awk '/BSSID/{print $2}')\"\nl=\"${#myBSSID}\"\nif [[ $l -lt 17 ]]; then\n    myBSSID=\"$(system_profiler SPAirPortDataType | awk '/BSSID/{print $2}')\"\nfi\nawk -F ',' -v theBSSID=\"$myBSSID\" '$1 == theBSSID {print $2}' \"$HOME/Desktop/APtable.csv\"\n\n", "Q: How to setup Dual Apple Thunderbolt Display 27 inch with Thunderbolt 3 MacBook Pro and Ethernet My current setup\n2 Thunderbolt 27 inch displays\n7 port Dlink USB 2.0 HUB\n15\" MacBook Pro Retina, Late 2013\nVarious low power USB 2.0 Peripherals plugged into hub\nI have the one monitor daisy chained into the other which also has an ethernet 1 Gb/s connection and the USB hub connection. This is all connected to my MacBook Pro with the Thunderbolt 2 connection.\n\nUpgrading to 2016 MacBook Pro\nI thought it would be relatively simple to simply get a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter.However, Apple support said that this is not possible.\nIf that is true, why? They said I would need an adapter for each Thunderbolt Display. An adapter for the ethernet, and an adapter for the USB 2.0 hub.\nThat's a total of 4 adapters!\nHowever, I'm wondering if that is true since you can buy hubs (OWC Thunderbolt 2 Dock) which this guide says will run over a single Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter. These hubs can have various thunderbolt/hdmi/ethernet connections. In principle, aren't I using the Thunderbolt display in the same manner?\n\nA: The product page indicates that you CAN use the adapter for the display.\n\nIn addition, it can be used to connect Thunderbolt-enabled displays — such as the Apple Thunderbolt Display and LG Thunderbolt 2 displays — to any of the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports on your MacBook Pro.\n\nPlease note the distinction between Thunderbolt and mini-DisplayPort. The Apple 27\" Thunderbolt Display ISN'T primarily a display. It's actually a Thunderbolt-connected hub with a built-in display. Why is this distinction important? Because it means that the data traveling from the computer is being transmitted via Thunderbolt, not DisplayPort protocols. While it is true that you wouldn't be able to use the Thunderbolt 2/3 adapter for a mini-DisplayPort monitor, using it to connect your Thunderbolt monitors WILL work. According to the products webpage:\n\nThis adapter does not support DisplayPort displays like the Apple LED Cinema Display or third-party DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort displays\n\nSource: Apple Product page\nEdit: I assume you mean the 2016 MBP, as no 2017 model has been released as of this question.\n", "Q: Not getting video from GTX 970, Mac Pro 2008 (MacPro3,1) We had a hard drive crash with 10.10.5. I replaced the hard drive, reloaded 10.10 using my native ATI 2400 XT, ran all updates, installed latest web drivers, added the nvda_drv=1 boot argument, shut down, popped in the GTX 970, heard the chime for start-up but did not get to desktop.

I want to share my internet connection in such a way that my SSID is not visible/discoverable on other devices. I want to allow access only to devices which know my SSID/mac address. Is there a way I can accomplish this?\n\nA: While most routers provide the option to hide your SSID by not broadcasting it, to the best of my knowledge there is no built-in macOS way to do the same thing. \nHowever, if the main reason you wanted to hide it was because you wanted to limit access to only those devices you wanted to connect to it, you can do this by setting a password on the Wi-Fi network your Mac is creating/sharing.\nYou can do this from the System Preferences > Sharing pane. \nWhen you look at the Internet Sharing options, click on \"Wi-Fi Options\" button at the bottom-right of the screen and then you will be able to set the name, channel, and password of your ad-hoc network.\nBy doing this, other devices may be able to see your network, but they can't connect without the password.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) high temperature I know there are plenty of articles here about CPU reaching very high temperatures but I am still concerned about mine.\nI bought a used MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015 (i5, 2.7 Ghz) computer this week. This is not my first MacBook Pro (I had 2012 non retina model) but it has never reached 100C unless I played games or did some video rendering.\nWhat makes me really worried is that CPU temperature easily reaches 100-105C when I open Adobe Bridge and click \"Space\" keyboard button to generate a 100% image preview. I know that it's using CPU graphics processor for this task but is it really normal for the temperature to get critical when doing such a simple task? The fan runs at around 2000 RPM until the CPU temperature reaches <100C. Then the fan starts running really fast and keeps the temperature at around 95-100C if I continue doing my tasks.\nI know that MacBooks are built to work under high CPU temperature but I also know that high temperatures are not good for the lifetime of hardware. Should I be concerned about CPU temperature getting critical values so easily?\nThe temperature of my MacBook is around 40C when idle, 50-70C when I am browsing or watching online videos, I can never hear the fan until the temperature reaches critical 100-105C values.\nIs it really normal? I don't want to believe that a 1 year old MacBook Pro can have a big amount of dust inside the fan or thermal paste to be dried out so quickly.\nThank you and I appreciate your comments.\n\nA: As a starting point I would reset both your NVRAM and your SMC. See below for instructions.\nReset your NVRAM\nNewer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nReset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. To reset this on your particular MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter doing both these, let us know how you go.\nCompare CPU temperatures\nAlso, as a point of reference, this resource (which can be filtered) will give you an idea of the wide range of temperatures that Macs can work with. However, after you've reset both the NVRAM and SMC you can monitor your CPU temperature and then use this resource to compare your temps to other comparable models.\n", "Q: Fish adb not found I installed fish shell on my macbook. when I try to run the command adb - get error fish: Unknown command 'adb', though adb is added to .bash_profile.

(i.e. the CWD) in its path by default, so simply entering the directory containing the binary you want to run is not likely to work.  If that's strictly necessary, explicitly specify the path:\n$ ./binary_to_run\nIn general, including '.' in the path is a security exploit waiting to happen.\n", "Q: Execute alias with sudo at session startup I created the following alias and put it into my ~/.zshrc:\nalias kiosk-proxy=\"echo \\\"rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\\\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\"\n\nIt's basically a pf rule which redirects all incoming traffic with the destination port 80 to 127.0.0.1:8080 (but what it does is not important, it's just to give you some context)\nCurrently, I have to manually run this at every session startup, I'd like to automate it.\nIt would be rather simple if it didn't need sudo rights, I'd just put kiosk-proxy in my ~/.bash_profile, I guess. \nBut since it needs sudo, it's gonna ask for the password and I doubt it's gonna prompt it.

Worse case, I can move the alias to another file.\n\nA: Enabling pf (with the rdr rule) with a command/alias or a shell script/function in your bash/zsh profile like in your question is neither common nor good practice.

Apps licensed under the GNU GPL are not allowed in the App Store (Mac or iOS) because Apple's terms and the terms of the GPL are mutually incompatible.\nCould this problem be bypassed by releasing a non-GPL dummy application which simply downloads and installs the GPL application? Would Apple accept such an application?\nIf necessary, the dummy app could be marketed as a \"downloader\" or \"updater\" for the GPL app.\n\nA: This is not possible. Apps can't download other apps.\n\n2.5.2 Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code, including other iOS, watchOS, macOS, or tvOS apps.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements\n", "Q: iTunes 12.5.5.5 can no longer delete subscribed podcasts I have used iTunes for years, and now suddenly after an update I can no longer delete a subscribed podcast.

Before the update, this worked just fine.\n\nA: Just click the podcast and press, \"delete\" (backspace)\nI experienced the same issue, removing the podcast from the menu did nothing.\n\nA: I partially share your problem. I'm running 12.6.1,25 and I go to the podcast menu and try to delete individual episodes and it does nothing. Cannot delete anything.\nIf I go up a level and delete the whole podcast it works. Then I have to go find the podcast and re-establish it.\nAnother strange thing- All podcasts have been queued up going back to the first episode of each one.

After quitting calendar and Removing the cache I saw the cache files were immediately renewed. So I took a look at the running processes within the system activity monitor (programs/utilities) and found two still active processes, being Calendar (so even stopping the program left the proces active) and a proces called CalendarAgent. \nLooking at it after the repair, I see that the Calendar proces disappears when I quit the program from within Finder.

To speed up the process I have two drives.\nI'd like to set up a script (pure bash or bash + AppleScript combination) that runs on insert. macOS allows to configure a script in Settings › CDs & DVDs › On insert…\nThe process should look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert DVD in one of the two drives\n\n*Script starts and checks which drive triggered the command (hardest part for me)\n\n*Opens a Terminal window and runs the actual script\n\n\nA rough draft of what my idea is:\n#!/bin/bash\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/THEDRIVE\necho -n `date \"+%Y-%m-%d - %H:%M:%S -> Starting with DISCTITLE\"` >> iso.log\ndd if=/dev/THEDRIVE | pv -s DRIVESIZE | dd of=/myfolder/DISCTITLE.iso\necho -n `Finished DISCTITLE, took TIME.

But I have, of course, always both drives present.\nHow could I use e.g. awk or sed to get device/mountpoint, disc title, size and drivenumber (to eject the right one) of the current disc?\n\nA: I've managed to solve it very easily.\nAfter comparing Mac DVD Ripper Pro, MacX DVD Ripper Pro (don't confuse the two), RipIt and AnyDVD for Windows. I decided to use Mac DVD Ripper Pro.\nIt has a setting to start automatically after inserting a DVD and ejecting it after being finished.\nI run two instances of the app using open -n /Applications/MDRP.app. Since MDRP picks up the first DVD it finds, and the first one won't be available, the second instance will pick up the second DVD drive and vice versa.\nOutput .iso is not a bitwise copy, since MDRP takes care of the copy protection (at least CSS was no problem) but played well in my tests with VLC and Kodi (on my Media Server).\nOnly thing I didn't find were log files, but everything else I've been looking for is solved this way.\nIf you prefer video_ts output over .iso you can do the same thing using RipIt, RipIt also in-officially supports ripping from two drives at the same time.\nNote: I haven't yet tried ripping DVDs protected with Sony ArccOS, UOPs, and Disney X-project as mentioned in the comments.

I have a 2011 Macbook Pro 15\" running Sierra.\nThe Macbook's fans are annoying me to no end - they are running most of the time I do serious work, right from the minute I start. It can get hot here in the summer, but it happens also at reasonable room temperatures, like right now, at 23°C (73°F).\nHere's a graph of my CPU load over an extended period of time, looking fairly relaxed to my eyes:\n\nyet the fan is running constantly:\n\nThis has been happening for the past three versions of OS X, so it's nothing version specific. (I started thinking that maybe this isn't normal only recently.)\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Made sure there are no processes running in activity monitor that hog a lot of CPU time (my work tends to be CPU/GPU intensive though, Photoshop, IDEs, etc. open in parallel all the time)\n\n*Reset NVRAM and SMC, many times\n\n*Opened the device and removed a giant piece of lint from behind the air ducts (I was sure that'd fix it):\n\n(I didn't do anything else in there other than remove the easily accessible, obvious blockage, though)\nIs this normal? Is there anything I can do? Is there some unofficial way to get to the CPU, and maybe apply some better thermal paste? Is there some other potential bottleneck that I should look at other than CPU?\nThe machine is perfectly usable for me otherwise despite its age (after a RAM and SSD upgrade).\n\nA: You need to strip & clean the entire airflow, if that fluff-ball was clogged in the outlet, there's an entire duvet inside. All the machines here get a full strip & clean once a year, with a 'quick blow round' in between. If it's gone 6 years without cleaning, it's likely to be pretty well-insulated in there by now.\niFixit teardowns are second to none - there is far too much for me to try to précis here\niFixit - MacBook Pro 15\" Unibody Early 2011 Teardown\n\nA: Open Activity Monitor and take screen shots of the full window to share with us. I'd like to see the CPU tab, sorted by % CPU with the arrow pointing down; and the ENERGY tab, sorted by Avg Energy Impact with the arrow pointing down.\nThese can help us find out if you have a run-away app or process.\nAfter taking those screenshots, I'd advise performing a Safe Boot. Give it a few minutes of runtime, long enough for you to determine if it's better in Safe Boot or not, then restart to get back out of Safe Boot.\n\nA: I have a Macbook Pro 15\" Late 2011 and I did this:\nAssuming your heatsink and air chamber is free of dust, cleaning the 2 Sunion fans is key, specifically their fan blades. I went from 6000-6200 rpm to 4000-4500 rpm with 25% cpu usage.\n\n*\n\n*Disassemble each fan into its 2 metal plates by removing 2 small phillips screws and the electrical tape holding the fan wire. Place tape elsewhere on a table so it does not stick to dust and cotton fibres.\n\n*Use a tooth pick and a tiny little cotton ball (from a q-tip) and wedge it deep between every fan blade to remove the caked on dust. Give it a good scrub.\n\n*Caked on dust won't go away with a simple air compressor can, you need cotton ball friction to remove it\n\n*Remove any stray cotton q-tip fibres around the fan assembly, they might start a fire since cotton is flammable\n\nAir friction from the dust on each fan blade is a major debuff to the airflow, causing your fans to spin faster and louder to compensate.\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut for moving selected message(s) to the Junk folder in macOS Mail?

Thanks \n\nA: If you're indicating that you're in Safe Boot and your audio is not working on the built-in speakers of your Mac... that's expected. Safe Boot is a testing environment only and some things simply do not function there due to the imposed limitations of Safe Boot, for the purpose of testing.\nIf Safe Boot fixed your primary issue, then simply restart. If the issue is still resolved, then hooray. If not, then you have something causing an issue in at least one of the following locations: Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, Startup Items, or Login Items.\n", "Q: IOS and OSX update url or IP blocking? As the title says, I am wondering, does anyone know the url or ip ranges the iPhone and OSX tries to connect to when trying to auto update?\nI have searched for how to block updates and such. I have seen nothing on this area of thought. I know one can block updates on IOS from happening on Cell Data. But both IOS and OSX will annoyingly get updates when on wifi.\nSo my thought is to just block the known addresses they look for at the router/firewall box.\n\nA: Apple has an exhaustive but not completely comprehensive document listing the ports needed for the various features:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202944\nSometimes new ports pop up and new destinations - so you'll want to set up monitoring if you have a need to prevent updates that is worth the engineering effort to determine if/when Apple changes their setup.\nFor updates, you'd need to block port 80 and 443 so it's probably better for you to disable updates rather than try to block them. Apple does change the endpoints and fall back to common ports when specific ports are blocked. \nRather than work on firewall rules, since you'll likely block other functionality like push notification and App Store function if you block all Apple IP over those ports, think about configuration profiles to prevent / block updates if you can't just set up devices to not check or apply updates.\n\nA: 1) Go here to block iOS updates coming straight from Apple, current (2017-2018).

You can review the MacBook Pro 13\" Unibody Mid 2012 Logic Board Replacement page which details the tools required and steps involved. If you feel comfortable doing this, then you can decide whether or not purchasing a replacement logic board is an economical exercise or not.\nWithout knowing your location, I can't really recommend a retailer to purchase one from.

This will keep things separated. \nWhen using your main \"superuser\" account you will have to remember to choose \"install only for this user\" rather than \"install for all users\" if you want some programs to be unavailable from your other accounts. Even if you \"install for all users\" this would just give your work user the ability to launch the program, like Chrome, but it would not see the history or bookmarks or extensions that you had installed as the home user.\nThe instructions vary slightly depending on which version of OS X you are using. In the Sierra dialog shown, you open System Preferences then Users and Groups (Accounts on previous versions) then unlock in the bottom left\nthen the plus sign to add a new user. Make them a regular account, not admin and they won't be able to see documents from other accounts. There - you have the separate desktops you wanted. To switch between desktops use AppleMenu - logout, then log back in as the next user. It's much faster than a shutdown or restart.

I have a Macbook Pro and an iPad Pro 9.7\".\nUsing Duet, I can use the iPad as a second monitor. That's awesome for my setup - but Duet requires the iPad being connected to the host machine through the lighting cable.\nI'm worried that having the iPad connected to the Macbook all the time (and hence, getting charged all the time) could be bad for the iPad's battery life in the long term. (The iPad would be connected for many hours every work day.)\nDoes this worry have merit, or is it unfounded?\n\nA: It shouldn't affect the battery life of your iPad unless you keep it plugged in forever (for a very long amount of time, which you shouldn't). This is like plugging in your iPad for the whole night. It will stop charging itself when it is full and simply just be running on the power adapter. Unless you decided to leave it in forever (the problem with this is that it will always be using the lightning cable to draw power and the battery is hardly even used) otherwise it shouldn't be a big problem to worry about. You also don't have to worry about battery draining while using the iPad by plugging into your MacBook as your MacBook will provide extra energy enough for the iPad to charge and be running on the Lightning Cable.\nIf you want to learn more about how charging works on iPhone (should be the same for iPad) there is another question here that give some detailed information on how iPhone/iPad charges.\n\nA: It will only be bad for the battery life if the battery actually discharges. If the power provided by the host device is enough to drive the tablet, the battery should never be discharged. \nGiven that the display of any large tablet is very power hungry, and USB ports of many laptops deliver very little power, I suggest to try it out while the tablet is at around 50%, and check if the battery is higher than 50% after an hour or so. If it is noticeably higher than 50%, you're fine. The answer will be different for different laptops, and might even depend on the laptop being plugged in or on battery.\n\nA: iOS devices are designed with intelligent battery management software (as part of iOS) that ensures leaving them plugged in, even during use, is not bad for the battery.\nIn particular, when the device is nearly 100% charged, it goes through charge/discharge cycles that are beneficial for battery life in the long run.  You can read about that for example in this older article about iPad batteries.\nLi-ion batteries are not Ni-Cad batteries, which needed full discharges to keep from having a 'memory' effect.  Li-ion batteries are most healthy when not quite fully charged, but much worse for them is being fully discharged; and an Li-ion battery that is kept fully charged all the time isn't particularly bad for it (it's the act of charging from very discharged to fully charged that's a bit bad for it).\n\nA: The battery will wear faster when you use power-hungry applications or set the display very bright very often. Duet may be such an application.\nYou may not notice it, but the battery transfers much more energy in the same amount of time. This leads to more 'battery cycles' which in turn degrade your battery.\nIt has no negative impact on the battery life if you keep the Lightning cable in plugged in all the time.\nHowever, use the original 12 Watt USB power adapter and a certified Lightning cable for your safety, especially if you leave the iPad unattended.\n\nGeneral tips to increase your iPad's battery life\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep the device cool. Remove unneccessary cases and don't place it near warm objects.\n\n*Use certified Lightning cables. This is for your safety. You don't need to expensive cables made by Apple, as long as they are certified. They are called MFi which stands for \"Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad\". MFi cables undergo electrical and mechanical tests by Apple.\n\n*Use original power adapters. Again, you don't want the power adapter to catch fire.\nIt's fine to connect the charging cable to your computer's USB port instead. \n\n*If your iPad will be unused for some days, discharge the battery to ~50 %. \"(…) if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\"\n\nTerminology\nBattery cycles\n\nWhen you use your [device], its battery goes through charge cycles. A charge cycle happens when you use all of the battery’s power—but that doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge.\nFor example, you could use half of your notebook's charge in one day, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two.\n\nSource: Apple, emphasis mine\nBattery wear/degradation/condition/health\nThe more you use a battery the more its capacity will reduce over time. This is sometimes called 'battery wear'.\nBattery degradation can have different causes. Using a device so often that you need to re-charge it daily from 0 to 100 % will lead to a high battery cycle count. The chemicals in the battery will store less energy after each cycle.\nThe battery condition can give you a hint how much of its original capacity a battery can hold. It may be ok for a battery to retain about 80 % of its original capacity after 1000 full cycles. If you have a new device with the same low battery condition (80 % capacity) something may be wrong with your battery. This can be caused by faulty battery or a few cells within your battery that are not working.\nBattery condition is sometimes called battery health.\n", "Q: Can iOS display a text message notification icon in the status bar? My mother has just moved from an Android phone to an iPhone SE and she misses the fact that she no longer gets a text message notification icon at the top of the screen. This is a small envelope shaped icon in the same region of the screen as the WiFi connected symbol.\nIs there any setting or application that will give her this functionality?\n\nA: Notification icons in the status bar aren't a feature of iOS, just Android, so there's no way to get the look you're talking about.\nYou will, however, get a notification and a sound on the lock screen/home screen when you get a text, a badge on the Messages app icon that you can enable/disable in Settings -> Notifications -> Messages, and the notification will be accessible in Notification Center (which shows up when you swipe down from the top of the screen) until you read the message.\nWhile iOS surely has some advantages over Android, its customisation options aren't one of them: there's just no way to get those icons you want there.\nThough I haven't tested it, it may be possible to do this if you jailbreak an iPhone—see @timothymh's answer.\ntl;dr: There's no way to do this with iOS.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible as of iOS 10.3.\nBy default iOS has this behavior when it comes to message notifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*new messages will be displayed on the Lock Screen (called Notifications)\n\n*the notifications on the Lock Screen disappear if you unlock the phone\n\n*the number of unread messages will be displayed as a badge on the Messages.app's icon\n\n*you can see all notifications for unread messages by pulling the Notification Center (swipe down from the top of the screen)\n\n*if you read a message by opening the corresponding app the notification will disappear from the Notification Center\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: If your phone is jailbroken, you can install a tweak which modifies banner notifications such that they appear in the status bar, such as ThinBar or Resero. There are also a plethora of tweaks which let you display icons in the status bar when an app icon has a badge on the home screen.\nOtherwise, this is not possible.\nEdit: As Monomeeth mentioned below, jailbreaking is a somewhat technical and sometimes buggy process, which in many cases voids the warranty, so I would not recommend jailbreaking the phone of someone who isn't utterly familiar with what that means, such as (I assume) your mother.\n", "Q: OSX Lion AFP multiple requests to NAS I've got 8 TB of NAS shared with a network of mostly MacOSX Lion iMacs via AFP. \nRight after opening the share, the computer starts to send an enormous amount of FPEnumerateExt2 requests, trying to get the sizes of the shared files and calculate sizes of folders.\nMultiply it by several computers, and network and NAS quickly gets flooded by the requests rendering it borderline unusable.

As Intel releases new processors, they also release new processor sockets, so the new processors, besides not being supported by the computer, literally won't fit in the computer.\nThe highest upgrade you'll be able to do is something from the same product line. The highest processor in that line is the X5492, which clocks in at 3.40 GHz.

I would also like to accsess the command line on my iOS device on a bigger screen.\n\nA: Answer:\nIf you put your phone in tethering mode, you can hook it up to the computer via USB and SSH to the IP address of your phone's tether or hotspot interface. You could also do it over WiFi or BlueTooth.  The IP address of the phone shows up as your laptop's tethered connection's gateway.\n\nCommentary:\n\"Keep my security while still being jailbroken.\"   \nYeah.. um, no.  You defeated security mechanisms on it to add customization.  It's a trade-off. If you're that concerned about potential security risks, you shouldn't have jailbroken the phone. \nThere is no way to get to the phone's console except from the phone itself without using SSH.\nSSH  (\"Secure SHell\") is plenty secure between your laptop and iPhone, especially with WPA on WiFi, if you're not going through any untrusted network devices.  \nSSH over USB tethering is your most secure option.

Which one is the best? If none of them are good enough, which one is the cheapest that i can get? Thanks!\n\nA: All of them will perform similarly for development, since they all have Core 2 Duo's running at about the same clock. RAM will be your saving grace in this case, so plan to upgrade any 2GB machine to 4, 6, or 8GB.  I also recommend upgrading the drive to an SSD, which should be possible in all of these machines (except perhaps the Air).\nIf you get the Mini, you will have to factor in the cost of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, unless you have them already.\n\nI have a 17\" 2007 MBP with 6GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD. It boots quickly and El Capitan looks great on it.  I am able to detect a little bit of sluggishness compared to my newer machines, but that is to be expected.  It does heat up when doing heavy tasks, like compiling.\nBeware that some of the 2007 MBP's had problems with the Nvidia GPU solder failing and the screen going blank.  If the owner got the GPU problem fixed by Apple's recall or by one of the companies performing the GPU replacement, it should be fine.

(Source: Apple Communities)\nSecond, reset your NVRAM by turning off your Mac, holding ⌥⌘PR and turning your Mac on again. Make sure to hold the buttons until you hear the startup chime for the second time.\nShut down your Mac one more time, then reset its SMC by pressing ⇧Ctrl⌥ and the Power button at the same time. Your Mac needs to be connected to a power supply during that entire process. Keep an eye on the little light on the MagSafe plug while you hold down the for keys. Release the keys at the same time. The MagSafe light should change colors for a second or so; if it doesn’t, retry until it does. Now try installing El Capitan again. (Source: Reset SMC of a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro Retina, or MacBook Pro’s with an internal non-removable battery)\nIf the installer still crashes during logBatteryState, try resetting the system management controller by physically removing the battery from the logic board. To do this, you’ll need to remove the screws from the bottom case, lift the case just like you did back when you installed the SSD. Locate the battery, then remove the three screws to detach it from the logic board (two screws are in plain sight and the third screw is hidden under a warning label.)\nNow lift the battery a bit, remove the connector from the logic board, press the Power button and hold it down for 10 seconds with the battery still disconnected. Now reattach the battery and retry the El Capitan installation one more time. (Source: this comment on ifixit.com)\nIf you have followed all the steps and the crash still occurs during logBatteryState, you might want to get another battery of the same model that is confirmed to work, then install it in order to figure out whether there is an issue with your battery; if not, it might be an issue with the PMC on your logic board.\n\nA: I have managed to enter new OS by pushing Shift and thus booting into Safe mode. I've got asked several questions about my time zone, keyboard layout etc, and it ended with Login screen with newly created user. However, the next problem is that installer remained \"sticky\" somewhere. Every time I tried to boot in non-safe mode, installer was starting again. I have no idea where does it write, but I guessed that if I try to update system, that update will overrride installer in the boot options. Indeed, I've got different message after reboot: \"Installing Software Update\". And then after reboot I was finally in the new OS in normal mode.\n", "Q: If the battery is very old are there any disadvantages or danger to use notebook with power adapter only? Lets say the battery has over 5000 cycles and is almost dead or dead. If I will use this notebook always with power adapter - is at dangerous in any way?\nI mean - is it possible that the old battery will explode etc.? \nIts MacBook Pro 2015 so it cannot be removed.\n\nA: Short answer:\nNo.\n\nMedium answer: \nThere is always a risk of something failing in a fantastic way, but the chances of a deadly situation are slim to none if the user is taking good care of their hardware (no frayed cords, no liquids near electronics, etc.).\n\nLong answer:\nSimply put, batteries are arrays of cells that consist of sandwiches of two metals and a chemical between them.  The reaction draws electrons from the negatively charged side of the cell, through the electronic device's circuitry, through the positively charged metal into the chemical compound, which eventually becomes saturated as the first metal's electrons are drained.  \nRecharging reverses this process, but flaws develop in the first metal's surface, causing it to resist or refuse additional inbound electron flow.  Eventually, the battery becomes unable to accept a new charge and has nothing left to give.\nThe battery's circuitry and charging circuitry have failsafe mechanisms to prevent shorting the battery (which can result in an explosion if there's enough current stored), shorting--and subsequently frying--the charger's power supply, and all the fun stuff in between.  With all of that safety equipment in place, it essentially means your battery's nothing but a brick that the charger refuses to touch.\nSo no, it is highly unlikely to explode.\nAll that being said, I have had old batteries swell and expand...\nCheck ifixit.com for what it would take to replace your laptop's battery, when the time comes.\n\nA: Adding to the very good answer from SirBryan, you should keep in mind that MacBooks also use the battery as a buffer. That means there can be situations, e. g.  when the GPU and CPU are under full load, where the power adapter simply does not deliver enough energy. They are designed in a way that they cover 95% of all load situations. \nSo, once your battery is completely dead,  the Mac has no choice but throttle the CPU to avoid peak power draw and therefore power failure. You are likely to notice a considerable performance loss at some point. \n", "Q: MB Pro instantly gobbling up 70+ Gb SSD - How to track culprit? Mac OS 10.10.5, MB Pro 16 GB DDR, 500 Gb SSD.\nProbable culprit app MS Excel for Mac 2011?\nIt seems that when I open up a spreadsheet with lots of formulas, within a few minutes I'm getting \"Out of Disk Space\" warnings. (before starting I have about 66 GB space)\nHow can I verify Excel is the culprit, and how can I manage it, other than buying a (very high priced) bigger SSD? I do keep my trash emptied, usually.\nAre there any tools/utilities which show files accessed sorted by bytes-written first, then date?\n\nA: It sounds like the operating system is swapping out.\nOpen Activity Monitor from the Utilities folder (inside Applications) and select the Memory tab.  Click on the Memory category until the little caret arrow points downward.  Then open Excel.\nAt the bottom, you can see if Swap Used increases.\n\n\nA: To find the culprit, you can use a free application called Disk Inventory X.

Nothing changed anything.\nThese folders and all their contents show up in Finder as Read&Write for my user, and they also do not have Locked property set. Somehow this is not true in practice.\nWhat can I do to fix this insanity?\nI have found only one thing that actually solves it — copy the whole folder, delete old one with sudo, rename it back. But it's impractical for huge folders because it's slow and hurts SSD life.\n\nA: UPDATE 2 (now I got it):\nThe culprit is the ACLs. Apparently Time Machine uses them, and copying via Finder preserves ACLs.\nThey are easy to remove recursively from folders where you know they are not needed:\nsudo chmod -R -N ~/Pictures for example will drop all ACL rules in ~/Pictures and everything inside.\nSource/more info: https://backdrift.org/fixing-mac-osx-file-permissions-and-acls-from-the-command-line\nolder unsuccessful attempts:\nAfter some more desperate searching and brainstorming, I came up with one workaround:\n1: Install coreutils from Homebrew (if not already done so)\n2: gcp -dRl <broken_folder> <temporary_folder> — this will \"copy\" it with hardlinks instead of actual copying while not preserving permissions and any other \"invisible\" things which could be broken, so it's fast and almost zero damage regardless of file sizes\n3: Test if permissions in temporary folder are OK \"in practice\"\n4: sudo rm -rf <broken_folder> && mv <temporary_folder> <broken_folder> — remove bad one and put fixed one in its place\nbased on this answer and GNU cp manual.\nUPDATE:\nIn newer versions of macOS even this doesn't work.

There is this nettop tool which shows the IP address but it doesn't show the public IP address when the Mac is connected via router - it shows the same address as we can see using System Preferences' Network option. Does anyone know how to see the public IP address of outgoing internet traffic leaving my computer?\n\nA: Another quick service is curl ifconfig.me\nAdd an echo afterwards to complete the line:\ncurl ifconfig.me && echo\n\n\n\nA: You can pick one of the many external services who parrot your public IP address back to you when you query them. For example,\ncurl -s http://ipecho.net/plain; echo\n\nI personally use it often enough so I wrap it in a shell function called myip, inspired by a shell function from the Bash-it library:\nfunction myip()\n{\n    res=$(curl -s http://ipecho.net/plain; echo)\n    echo -e \"Your public IP is: ${echo_bold_green} $res ${echo_normal}\"\n}\n\nUpdate: I edited the answer to use curl instead of wget because the latter does not come with macOS (thanks to user klanomath for pointing this out.)\n\nA: We (at work and while troubleshooting family/friends) always go to http://myipaddress.com in a web browser.  As Synoli stated, there are dozens of sites out there that show you the IP address the world sees when you browse and perform other tasks.\nYou may find that some ISP's, especially mobile network operators like AT&T, Verizon, etc. proxy everything behind a pool of IP addresses, and very often web traffic goes through a different set of proxies than everything else.\nIf your network is IPv6 capable, that could complicate things, with some providers doing 6to4, carrier-grade NAT, and others passing IPv6 straight through.\n\nA: Finally, I found the solution what I was looking for:\nnettop -L 0 > test.csv\nThis will take infinite logs and store in test.csv file for all the applications sending/receiving traffic over network. Note that some applications when set to use proxy can use different IP address. (This is to falsify one of the comments posted here which says all the applications use the same IP address). \n\nA: Beyond\nYou can use the Beyond application, which I wrote, to get a list of all your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:\nBeyond.app > Window (menu) > Beyond Network\n\nPaid users of the application can test if incoming traffic will also be routed to the Mac.\n", "Q: Stop macOS from asking to report to Apple every time I Force Quit an application Every time I force quit an application from Activity Monitor, I get a pop-up saying \"You have forced  to quit.

To do this, use:\ndefaults write com.apple.CrashReporter UseUNC 1\nThe advantage of this is you still get notified if an app has crashed, but you don't have to respond in any way (nothing to click on). To undo this change you would use the same entry but replace the 1 with a 0.\n", "Q: Is there a way to click windows fileshare links in macos? My company (like many others) primarily uses Windows computers and as such has a lot of Windows-based fileshares.

How can I do this?\n\nA: The default directory for third-party executables in macOS is /usr/local/bin. Since this directory already is in the PATH you don't have to modify anything except sudo linking the executable to this dir.\nIf the directory doesn't exist, create it with sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin.

With this done, press ⌘A to select all, then ⌘C to copy this information to the Clipboard.\nNow in Script Editor use the following command to get the RTF class data from the Clipboard.\nget the clipboard as «class RTF »\n\nWhat is returned will be used as the Custom RTF Document Template by assigning it to a variable in the actual script, e.g.:\nset customRTFDocumentTemplate to «data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»\n\nNote that the above template has the default font, Helvetica, with size set to 18 and one blank line as its content. If you want a different font then Helvetica, set both the font and size before adding content, a blank line in this case, then use the info above to get is as RTF class data from the Clipboard.\nAlso note that in the on openDocument() handler, the bounds list is set to {160, 22, 883, 639} not {160, 10, 883, 639} as the second item in the bounds list should not be less then the height of the menu bar.\n\nA: I've taken a different approach aside from the file check.

I intended on resetting it back to its factory settings since it was acting up in a lot of different ways - apps crashing, occasional freezes and just not very usable anymore. This has been going on for a while and gradually getting worse. Its quite old so I thought resetting it is probably worth a try.\nAnywho, upon having done so, I was prompted to plug the device into my PC and start iTunes. This is how far I've gotten - all PCs I've tried simply do not even recognize a corresponding USB device.\nAll of the online tips for this kind of situation, e.g. installing the newest iTunes version, did not help since the device does not seem to be communicating at even the most basic level.\nI'm not familiar with the internals of the iPad - is there a dedicated USB controller on one of the logic boards or are the signals routed directly to the CPU? I'm close to simply cracking it open and having a look, but I thought I'd ask for advice first - in hopes of someone having had a similar issue and possibly a better solution.\nCheers, Shibby\n\nA: You could try to set it in DFU Mode, sometimes that resolves the issue with a faulty USB-I/O. \n\nEntering DFU Mode on iPhone, iPad or iPod touch:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Plug your device into your computer with a USB cable. \n  \n*Turn off the device.\n  \n*Hold the Power button for 3 seconds.\n  \n*Hold the Home and Power buttons for 10 seconds.\n  \n*Release the Power button but keep holding the Home button.\n  \n*After about 15 seconds you will be alerted by iTunes saying that it has detected a device in Recovery Mode.\n  \n  \nSource: https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/DFU_Mode\n\n\nMaybe it depends on what iOS you are, so if it does not go into DFU Mode, research it.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: External SSD or HD. Performance compare to internal SSD? I have MacBook Pro 2015 with 128 SSD and want to have some extra storage.\nThe possible solutions I know are (all external): HDD, SSD, Flash.\nAre there any information about the performance of using any of the solutions comparing to my internal SSD? \n\nA: An external HDD is going to be ~100 MB/s, an external SSD closer to ~500MB/s, the SD card expanders (such as tardisk or transcend jetdrive) have read/write speeds only slightly slower than that of the HDD (~75MB/s). However, the SD expander has the advantage of not actually being external (it sits flush to the edge of the MBP and occupies the SD card spot). Your internal SSD likely has speeds close to ~700MB/s. Network attached storage will only be as fast as your connection. If you have an \"N\" network, your speed will max out at ~35MB/s, with an \"AC\" connection or gigabit Ethernet you should have no problem getting full ~100MB/s speeds.\n", "Q: how many hours has my laptop display been used? I often use my late-2012 AirBook laptop to watch streaming videos through an external monitor using the Thunderbolt port. When I do this, I usually turn the display brightness of my laptops screen all the way down (such that the apple logo on the back in no longer illuminated). I don't know that this counts as the display being \"off\" but I am curious if (like the battery hours/lifecycle count or other usage info in the System Report) there is a total number of hours tracked for the laptop display?\n\nA: If you're turning the brightness all the way down, the display is still on, but the backlight for the display is off. I do not believe a backlight tracker exists.\nI do not believe a display tracker exists either.\nHowever, assuming you rarely or never use your MBP with the screen closed (needs external keyboard/mouse/screen), you can calculate a rough estimate by multiplying the battery's cycle count by the average lifespan of the battery (100%-0%). I'm not sure why this information would be relevant, but for example if I have a cycle count of 460 and my battery generally lasts for about 7 hours, I'd have a display count of (very roughly) about 3200 hours.\n", "Q: Automator workflow triggered by another app?

I want to trigger the Automator script to play a particular track in iTunes when my Pomodoro work timer finishes.\nIf not possible can anyone recommend any other solutions? (please treat with kid gloves as am not a developer)\nthnkx\n\nA: You would probably need an API for the pomodoro app that you're using.

Then create an apple script which watches for the identified trigger and plays the sound bite you want when this trigger to call on the custom apple script.\n", "Q: Mail PDF attachments shown as 0 KB Since I updated to macOS Sierra (10.12.2) PDF attachment are shown with sizes of 0 KB and a preview is not embedded.

Is this a new virus?\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nA: Try entering your old password (assuming you just changed your password).\nAs I understand it, this pops up because the OS is trying to migrate your old keychain to the new one (post password change) and needs your authorization to access your keychain (thus needing your previous password to migrate to the new one).\nIt's a poorly thought out UX.\n\nA: Type this in the terminal:\nsecurity -v set-keychain-settings -t 72000 login.keychain \n\n", "Q: Opening Notes of another user account in OS X EI Captain I recently replaced my macbook's user account by changing account name from name1 to name2.

I know that firewire is kinda obsolete after apple killed it off but I know that firewire has good speeds and it would be great to use for copying big files (I often do).

The useless ultra generic error messages was not helpful at all, so I tried to format it from terminal with diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ OSX GPT /dev/disk3. There I was able to partially format the disk but finalisation broke with more errors. I was suspicious about electronics in this enclosure and macOS driver for it because I had several of them, and several SSD HDDs all showing same issue. All that lead me to investigate MBR/GPT of the disk in question.\nWhat was strange to me was that fdisk saw unknown partition ID and gpt did not work at all.\nDisk: /dev/disk3    geometry: 14593/255/63 [234441648 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  234441647] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       \n\nAnd gpt did not work at all:\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk3\ngpt show: error: bogus map\ngpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk3': Undefined error: 0\n\nThen I found about Hybrid MBR/Protective MBR/GPT issues people had, mostly due to BootCamp which was responsible for creating the Hybrid MBR conditions that was causing many problems to dual boot users (lost system partitions etc.). I was certain I created condition like that by my self (by using different non compatible OSX versions tough).\nThe solution in this case was to clear the hybrid MBR data, or even better to clear all GPT/MBR data on the disk (if you do not need the data), and start over.\nI was not able to use Apple utilities successfully, but GPT fdisk (gdisk) worked great for me. SIP fill forbid gdisk from working on system disk (unless it's disabled), but it works great with external HDDs. gdisk revealed that my MBR and GPT were very different.\nsudo gdisk /dev/disk3\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: MBR only\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid MBR and GPT. Which do you want to use?\n 1 - MBR\n 2 - GPT\n 3 - Create blank GPT\n\nIt's worth noting that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1 reads MBR partition table (as seen by fdisk) and converts\nthem to GPT. \n\n*Option 2 uses existing GPT (as seen by gdisk) and deletes the MBR partition table (becoming protective MBR) \n\n*Option 3 will start fresh with a new empty GPT.\n\n\nIf you want to save data on your HDD, do not do this. You have to repair it from gdisk. My fix was using option 3, then zaping (deleting all partition information) whole disk and recreating blank GPT:\nx\nz\nYes\ny\n\nAfter that I was again able to initialise/format the disk in Disk Utility again (and in terminal).\nMore info about GPT can be found here and here on gdisk homepage. \nThe fastest way to get gdisk is by brewing from cask with:\nbrew cask install gdisk\nHope this helps someone.\nIMHO - it is not unlikely that disks will end up this way if they are eg. used between OS'es. macOS should really have support to handle them without breaking a sweat, but sadly - it does not.\n", "Q: How to keep an application on top of all windows using AppleScript? I have an AppleScript .app file that basically consists of a series of dialogs.\nI would like to keep this application on top of all other windows (including on top of any new windows that are created while the application is still running), until the AppleScript is complete and the application automatically closes.\nCan pinning a window on top be accomplished in AppleScript?\n\nA: Method 1: SystemUIServer\nAfter hours of searching online and testing out various solutions, I've found one method to keep a running AppleScript on top of all windows. The method is provided in post #2 of this MacScripter.net thread.\nHere is the code:\ntell application \"SystemUIServer\"\n   activate\nend tell\n\nI placed my entire AppleScript code within the above tell statement. This worked perfectly on the first dialog, but, unfortunately, this caused an error soon after progressing through the AppleScript.\nWhat I had to do was manually encapsulate every dialog in its own tell statement. For every instance of:\nchoose from list\ndisplay alert\ndisplay dialog\n\nI had to add a statement. I have countless dialogs embedded in the AppleScript in question, so this took me several hours to complete.\nSo, this is not a great answer, as it is potentially very laborious. Ideally, one could insert the SystemUIServer statement just once in their code and be done with it. \n\nA note on the default timeout:\nIf you encapsulate a dialog within the above tell block, by default, the script will timeout if the user does not click a button within 2 minutes. When this timeout occurs, the script will be cancelled. The user will be given the following error:\n\nSystemUIServer got an error: AppleEvent timed out.\n\n(Strangely enough, however, even after the user closes this error dialog, the original dialog will still remain pinned to the top until the user clicks a button on the dialog.)\nHere's the relevant description from the AppleScript documentation for with timeout:\n\nWhen a command fails to complete in the allotted time (whether the default of two minutes, or a time set by a with timeout statement), AppleScript stops running the script and returns the error \"event timed out\". AppleScript does not cancel the operation—it merely stops execution of the script. If you want the script to continue, you can wrap the statements in a try statement. However, whether your script can send a command to cancel an offending lengthy operation after a timeout is dependent on the application that is performing the command.\n\nHence, if you do not want to have a timeout affect your dialogs, then do the following:\ntell application \"SystemUIServer\"\n    with timeout of 999999 seconds\n       activate\n        display dialog \"Hello World\"\n    end timeout\nend tell\n\n\nA note on input dialogs:\nMethod 1 does not work properly with a display dialog that has a text field (i.e., default answer \"\").\nWhile the dialog is kept on top of all other windows, if the user clicks anywhere outside of the bounds of the dialog, the user will not be able to type text in the text box. The blinking text cursor will permanently disappear.\nThe top bar of the dialog box immediately turns white when the user clicks out of the dialog. It is not possible to get the bar to return to the dark grey color (which reflects a foreground/active state), so that text can be typed.\nThe user will still be able to press any buttons in the dialog, but the primary function of the dialog, i.e., to get a text input from the user, will be seriously hampered.\nIn short, I do not recommend including input dialogs in a SystemUIServer tell block.\n\nMethod 2: FastScripts app\nAnother way to keep every dialog of an AppleScript file pinned on top of all other windows is to use a third-party application entitled FastScripts to trigger the script files. FastScripts keeps all dialogs pinned on top by default, which is very helpful. I don't even know if this feature can be disabled (if you wanted to turn it off; I don't).\nFastScripts can launch a .scpt file via either a custom keyboard shortcut or manually (simply click on the FastScripts icon in the menu bar to be presented with a drop-down list of your scripts).\n(I know that when I asked this question originally, I specified that the AppleScript was saved as an .app file. But, an AppleScript .app file can be converted to an AppleScript .scpt file easily and in little time.)\nOf course, this method is appealing because one does not need to edit one bit of their AppleScript code for the desired effect to be implemented. FastScripts does all of the hard work. \n", "Q: Multiple keychain-db files on Sierra I tried resetting my login keychain on Sierra because I was seeing lots of duplicate codesigning identities when running security find-identity -v -p codesigning.

Everything worked fine until I've installed Visual Studio 2015 (Update 3) with all of its components (50GB~).\nAfter I've rebooted the computer, it took ~10 minutes to load Windows (waiting at the dark screen with Windows logo and dots loading animation).

Reset System Management Controller (SMC)\nFollow the instructions on Apple's \"Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac\" page. This should not delete any of your saved data.\n2. Reset non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM)\nAgain, follow Apple's instructions on doing this, located at their \"How to reset NVRAM on your Mac\" page. This also shouldn't delete any of your saved data.\n3. Disable Notification Center (?)\nTry booting into single-user mode (Command + S while starting up), and type this command into the prompt:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.UserNotificationCenter.plist\nThis will disable the Notification Center and in turn the \"disabling of USB devices\", hopefully granting you access to your system.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2012 hangs on startup My 2012 MacBook Pro with Sierra recently started hanging at boot. It seems to start normally; the Apple logo and progress bar appear, but it hangs at about 3/4 of the way through.\nRight before I first had the issue I was using the machine normally then very suddenly (I'm not sure what triggered it) there were display issues where vertical lines appeared on the screen and the computer became unresponsive. I restarted it and it never came back up.\nThe same problem occurred when I tried to boot into the recovery partition and Windows 7.  I thought this was a hardware problem so I started the Apple Hardware Test with option-D and ran a diagnostic. It came up empty, no issues.\nI remembered that I had an old Time Machine backup sitting around. I tried to boot from that but after a few seconds the screen went blue with small black vertical stripes.\nDoes anyone know what the issue could be and how or if I can fix it?\n\nA: Black stripes on blue screen and booting problems is very alike a GPU problem just like MacBooks 2011 had. \nThough, to surely check it is not software you may try backing up data to another computer (requires removing Mac's HD and putting it into external case), format it and install a fresh MacOS from a flash drive. \n", "Q: Error with Homebrew install of ffmpeg --with all options After installing ffmpeg using Homebrew on my late 2012 MacBook Air i7 with macOS 10.12.3, I get this message:\nError: File exists - /usr/local/opt/ffmpeg/.brew\nThis path is a link to /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/3.2.2/.brew which ls -al reveals to contain only the Ruby file, \"ffmpeg.rb\"\nPrior to this I'd installed ffmpeg successfully using brew install ffmpeg but then uninstalled it to re-install with all the options per brew options ffmpeg:\nbrew install ffmpeg --with-chromaprint --with-fdk-aac --with-fontconfig --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-game-music-emu --with-libass --with-libbluray --with-libbs2b --with-libcaca --with-libebur128 --with-libgsm --with-libmodplug --with-libsoxr --with-libssh --with-libvidstab --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openh264 --with-openjpeg --with-openssl --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-rubberband --with-schroedinger --with-sdl2 --with-snappy --with-speex --with-tesseract --with-theora --with-tools --with-two-lame --with-wavpack --with-webp --with-x265 --with-xz --with-zeromq --with-zimg\nNow instead of a successful installation end message I get this:\n...\n==> make install\n==> make alltools\nError: File exists - /usr/local/opt/ffmpeg/.brew\n\nWith brew uninstall ffmpeg I've deleted the /usr/local/opt/ffmpeg/ linked directory and the actual /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/ directory.

the Homebrew bug report, the problem is specific to installing the chromaprint option:\n\nThe issue seems to be that chromaprint is being built with examples\n  by default, and therefore has a ffmpeg dependency. This means that\n  an installation of ffmpeg is already linked by the time the main\n  build actually begins.\n\nInstalling FFmpeg with all the Homebrew options except chromaprint reports no errors.\nOf note, installing without the chromaprint flag, ffplay works after the install without the need for using the additional command: brew unlink ffmpeg && brew link ffmpeg.\nAlso of note, installation of ffmpeg with the chromaprint option seems to prevent ffplay from becoming available. I am not sure what else might be compromised by this Homebrew installation bug, but otherwise, ffmpeg seems functional when installed with the chromaprint option. Even with the error message, an installation using the --with-chromaprint option renders the install enabled with the chromaprint option (per the INSTALL_RECEIPT.json file and the \"enabled options\" reported in the configuration) - including fpcalc.\nFFMPEG document on chromaprint formats.\nLukáš Lalinský's \"Introducing Chromaprint\" and \"How does Chromaprint work?\"\n", "Q: App to use iMac as digital photo frame for photos on a network drive?

I checked the Sharing Permission and it states that \"You can only read\".  In order to change my permissions, I reformatted the drive.\nI did not realize it would wipe my drive clean.  Can I recover the information in the drive.\n\nA: PhotoRec is a free program that I've used that may help you recover files. http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\nHowever, some information may not be recoverable no matter what you use, such as folder structures. Whatever you do, don't save any new files to the drive, and probably leave it off unless you are recovering. If you are uncomfortable, there are lots of places that will do data recovery for you.\nYou probably already know that you were unable to write to your external drive if it was formatted with NTFS. \n\nA: Try EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard for Mac 10.10 I had lost a drive with all my photos - and had deleted from a old drive that I reformatted. I was able to pull them from that old drive using this program, it has a 2gb recovery trial that will allow you to test it before you buy it.\n", "Q: is everything (files, programs, internet passwords) stored on the Hard Drive? I'm looking to sell my macbook due to a corrupted hard drive.

These are all stored on the hard drive itself. The only thing that will be left behind is the firmware, but that doesn't store any personal information or any records of what programs you may have had installed. If you'd like more information on firmware, you can check the wiki here: Firmware Wiki\n", "Q: How can I get iOS7 on my iPhone 3GS I’m have difficulty downloading WhatsApp on my iPhone 3GS because it is running iOS 6, which WhatsApp no longer supports.\nHow can I update my iPhone 3GS to iOS 7?\n\nA: There was a project for the iPhone 2G and iPhone 3G as well as the iPod 1G and 2G MB/MC called the WhiteDoor project, it was a custom firmware for the original iPhone that was designed to update the graphics, backport several features of newer iOS versions, and generally increase the scope of capability for the original iPhone so that it could still be used with modern apps and features.\nIt would seem that this project, called BlackDoor is the same idea as the WhiteDoor firmware, but designed for newer outdated iPhones (model 3GS is supported whereas WhiteDoor only supports up to the 3G.)\nBlackDoor firmware comes pre jailbroken, and has both Cydia, Installous, and IPA Installer by default. You may be able to find a modern copy of WhatsApp that is compatible with your model of iPhone on Cydia, as I know software is often maintained for older devices on there. Alternatively you should be able to install an older version of WhatsApp that is compatible with your device through Installous, or directly through IPA Installer if you can find the IPA (iPhone Application file) for an older version of it.\nIn any event it would seem like a jailbreak would be the best bet for you going forward in general, given how long it has been since Apple dropped support for the iPhone 3GS it is pretty much the only way you will be able to get ahold of and install apps who have dropped support for iOS 6, or use any features exclusive to newer versions of iOS without buying a new iPhone. \nOptions for jailbreaking include using the Evad3rs method (probably the easiest for someone new to jailbreaking, and will keep all of your data, a quick search should provide all needed info.), backing up your data and installing the BlackDoor firmware (as previously mentioned it comes pre-jailbroken, info about it, instructions on how to install it, and downloads for it can be found here BlackDoor website). Be aware that if you intend to install BlackDoor it is based on iOS 3.1.3 so it will be a substantial downgrade, only use this if you aren't comfortable with jailbreaking your iPhone yourself.\nFinally there is always the option of downloading a copy of the newest version of iOS 6 (6.1.2), opening it, injecting the jailbreak files, and required SHSH Blobs, creating a new custom firmware from the modified copy, signing it with a signature spoofing program like iFaith and manually installing it by putting the iPhone in DFU mode.\nObviously the last option is the most involved and I do not recommend attempting it unless you have a substantial amount of experience with jailbreaking iDevices. In any event though even if you can find an older copy of WhatsApp you will not be able to install it unless the device is jailbroken, as a jailbreak is required to install software without using the AppStore. Ultimately the Evad3rs method is probably the best option for you, and you can find it here if you are interested. Evasi0n.com\n\nA: Just go to Settings > General > Software Update to update iOS.

I've gotten into the (bad) habit of writing for hours within Stickies. It's fast to start up, uses very little RAM, doesn't distract me with bells and whistles or obtrusive GUI, it auto-saves, and the windows can be usually very small, which I like.\nSome of my notes are becoming rather large, however, and I am wondering if there's a limit to the quantity of text one can write in Stickies (with the default font and font size). Or if the limit may be assigned to the overall quantity of text within all Stickies notes combined.\n\nA: There shouldn't be. The only issue you may incur is writing too much for your RAM to handle, but that's into if you write gigabytes unto gigibytes of raw text. \nThe average user shouldn't. \n\nA: The database will surely struggle before you hit an architectural limit since HFS + lets a file grow to 8 Exabytes.\nI would perform a little profiling to see what is making your app slow if you find things problematic down the road.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off any apps that start when you log in to the Mac (System Preferences - search for log in items)\n\n*Restart your Mac and log in.\n\n*Open Activity Monitor (Applications/Utilities folder) - look at memory usage and CPU usage.

I’ve got a Mid-2012 Macbook Air that I changed out the SSD to 256Gb using the OWC Aura product. No problems at all – but it still only has 4Gb of ram and sucks it up pretty quickly now I have installed Sierra!\n8gb was a preconfigured option on these models and from what I can tell the RAM is soldered in.\nHas anyone upgraded one of these, and can you tell me how and using what RAM?\nThanks!\nPhil in New Zealand\n\nA: Nope, the RAM on the MacBook Air is soldered in so you won't be able to upgrade it without breaking the computer. You need to make sure the amount of RAM is enough when you buy the machine.\nIf you don't mind you can downgrade the OS (the lowest you can get on 2012 MBA is 10.7.4), that will probably reduce the amount of RAM needed.\n\nA: No answer, but I'm having the same problem. With the relative speed of SSD memory, which this model has,it would seem feasible to have an app that could set aside a bit of the drive into a \"pseudo RAM\".

One big problem I have are notifications, I receive hundreds of valid notifications each day (emails, messages, calendar reminders, etc) and I want to remove all notifications except calendar reminders. In android they were grouped by app so I was able to simply remove all emails for example. But now I either have to manually remove each email or I have to \"clear all\", which also clears calendar reminders.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot clear all notifications without clearing reminders as well (by the way, on iOS they are just called Reminders). If you want to selectively clear notifications, you'll have to do that manually, just the way you described it. It's either one or all.\n\nA: Another approach would be to prevent most apps from appearing in the Notification Center altogether.\nOpen Settings → Notifications and for every app you don’t want in the Notification Center, toggle Show in Notification Center Off.\nYou will still receive notifications as normal for those apps, but you won’t need to clear them out of your Notification Center.\nI do this for apps that show a Badge Icon since I’m reminded of their notifications right from the home screen anyway.\n", "Q: Way to send Computer audio wirelessly (wifi or bluetooth) to iOS device to be heard on its speakers? \nInspired by this question over on Ask Ubuntu:\nA method to send Ubuntu's (16.04) audio over WiFi to iOS (10.2) device?\n\nIs there a way to stream audio from another computer (whether it's Linux, Mac, or Windows) to an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) such that the audio can play over the iOS device?\nI know there are solutions for Android or such, but was curious if there's a solution or method to do this with iOS devices.\n\nA: You can buy a bluetooth to audio jack adapter:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Stereo-Adapter-Transmitter/dp/B00RHKYX7W\nThis way you should be able to use it as an amplifier using Garage Band amp on your iPhone.\nIt should work just like so:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkL0bIx-ESk\n", "Q: GPS on iPhone 6 is not accurate or working at all 1 week ago my GPS worked very accurately on Google Maps.

I want to make a launch daemon that automatically launches yalu on boot, but I cannot find the app executable. Does anybody know where iOS 10 stores apps?\n\nA: Long story short is that, unfortunately, only signed code can be ran before the jailbreak and your daemon will fail to launch. If unsigned daemons worked before the jailbreak, they could have already used that as an untether.\nIn fact, some jailbreak developers discussed this publicly just a few days after this answer was made and they arrived at the same conclusion. They went into it further and and came to the realization that even if they signed it themselves through the Apple developer signing tool, it would not work because only binaries signed by Apple can be executed as a daemon.\n\nA: Applications have been moved in iOS 10.

I simply contacted Bose and they ended up replacing my headphones and even gave me the gen 2 headphones\n\nA: If your Bose QC35 headphones are simultaneously connected to your MacBook and iPhone, then whichever device is sending an audio signal through to them will be heard in the headphones. \nNow, pausing iTunes on your MacBook only pauses iTunes, it isn't going to pause any other audio - so if your headphones are connected at the time then any other audio will still be heard on your headphones, not on your internal MacBook speakers.\nIf what you want is for sound effects to not play through your headphones, then you can configure your Sound preferences (System Preferences > Sound) so that sound effects play through your internal speakers, even when your headphones are connected via Bluetooth.\nHope this helps, but if I've misunderstood your problem, perhaps you could clarify your question. \nReset and pair again\nAnother option you could try is to full reset your bluetooth device list and start again. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slide the power switch to the Bluetooth symbol and hold it there\n\n*After about 10 seconds you should hear \"Bluetooth device list cleared\"\n\n*Now delete your headphones from the Bluetooth list on your MacBook and iPhone\n\n*Pair your headphones again, but only to your MacBook\n\n*Use your headphones with your MacBook for long enough to feel your issue is resolved\n\n*When satisfied, pair your headphone to your iPhone\n\n*Test to see if the behaviour is now what you expect between both devices\n\n\nNOTE: I have always found that there are random issues like you're experiencing when multiple devices are simultaneously connected to Bluetooth headphones. For me, I no longer do this - but hopefully you have more success.\nBose Support\nIt may be worth you checking with Bose Support. I remember reading somewhere that these headphones can have their firmware updated - so perhaps Bose could shed some light on the issue you're having or whether or not there is an update available.\n\nA: I ran into this issue today and what did the trick for me at least on the 2015 Macbook Pro is holding shift + option and clicking on the bluetooth icon on in the menubar. After that point ot debug and than click on reset bluetooth module. I had the bluetooth turned off on the back and my headphones turned off as well when I did it. Presumebly it should work when the mac bluetooth module is online but I took the safe route. I reconnected my headphones to my iphone and than back to my Macbook and the seemless sound work again. I am guessing the bluetooth module is running into some error code and it just descides to hog the headphones for ever.

You've made it pretty clear you have valuable footage on this drive you can't risk losing, so you really should have a second drive for backup purposes.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Seems to be something with WD and Mac products. It would not eject, I shut it down, and it no longer recognized. A strange way I fixed this was I plugged it into a chromebook (which recognized the exfat without any issue) ejected it from there (made NO CHANGES, and then suddenly it worked fine. I don't know what is up but it is getting annoying.\n\nA: The SAME exact thing happened to me. Including storing a lot of video files on my drive and it being vital that I didn't lose any of them. I tried shutting down my MacBook and when I restarted it, the files were showing again in my WD EastStore 10 TB drive. THANK GOD.\n", "Q: Can I buy an unlocked iPhone in Japan? I'm going to Japan (Tokyo, being more specific) on April, and I'd like to buy an iPhone there. I made some research and found mixed information about whether is possible to buy an unlocked iPhone 7 256GB in an Apple Store in Tokyo.\nThis post for example, is from someone that bought an iPhone and it didn't work in US. But MadDane said in Aug 18, 2016:\n\nI have lived in Japan and have friends that came to visit while I was there that bought an iPhone 6s while there. This was at an Apple Store in Tokyo, but it was unlocked and works perfectly overseas. So you should definitely be able to get the same.\n\nSo, is it possible to buy an unlocked iPhone in Japan at an Apple Store to use it later with a GSM carrier in Brazil?\n\nA: It is possible to buy a unlocked iPhone at any apple-store in japan, but there are the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*LTE Freqency Band does not match (Japan 2,1 GHz / Brazil 2.6 GHz). That means, LTE will not work. You will need the model A1778 and in Japan you can only buy the model A1779: http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/\n\n*You can not claim any warranty replacements outside of japan\n", "Q: Multithreaded compression in xz on macos Is it possible to use the multithreaded compression built into xz 5.2+ on macos?

It was explained to me like this:\n\"If you use -9, it means it uses 64 MiB LZMA2 dictionary and the default block size is 3 * dict_size = 192 MiB, a new thread is started for every 192 MiB of input.\"\nSo at -9 I would need a filesize of 1344+ MB to get all 8 cores active, each working on a >192MB block of data\n", "Q: \"Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar\" setting not remembered I see no keyboard & character indicator on the menubar panel, and trying to enable \"Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar\" in  System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard tab, that has no effect and, after closing and re-opening that settings window, Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar is still NOT ticked.\n\nI use more than one keyboard layout and I need to permanently see the active one on the panel, and switch between them from there (at the present I can only switch from shortcut), like in this image I found on the internet:\n\n\nA: I think you are looking for this option:\n\n", "Q: iPhone 6 after death My 89 yr old Dad just died.  Before I catch static, yes, I have a death certificate.  He was somewhat forgetful and would often forget passwords and reset them (and forget those too).  I have his phone and I know his iCloud ID but I do not know his phone unlock code nor his iCloud ID.  When I try to reset his iCloud ID, it wants to notify his iPhone (which I cant unlock).\nCan I:\n\n\n*\n\n*erase his iPhone -- so it will be unlocked\n\n*have iCloud send the password reset to the iPhone\n\n*get into his iCloud and then restore the phone?\n\n\nA: I guess your objective is to be able to use iPhone again and not recovering anything from the phone. You can follow this guide to erase your phone and remove the passcode.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT204306\n\nA: If you don't have any way to get in to his iCloud:\nReset the iPhone.\nIf you have the iCloud password:\nUnlock the passcode with iCloud.\n\nA: and sorry for your loss.\nMy best friend went through this problem a little while back when his husband passed away. You always have the choice of resetting the device, but if you might want to see some of the things on the device as a sort of keepsake, like emails etc... Then you have to call Apple and give proof of the passing, I'm not 100% sure they will do for a Father-Daughter situation, but they got my friend access right away. He did have to send a copy of his marriage license and death certificate via email, but If I understand your question correctly, and Apple still does this, you should be able to gain access by contacting apple or AppleCare (I think they are one in the same under Support. Oh, and ask for a supervisor or manager.\nI hope this helps, and again, I am sorry for your loss.\n", "Q: Transfer folder from MacBook to iPad I want to transfer folder that contains many video files from MacBook to iPad. I don't want to use iCloud. I use AirDrop.

Is there a way to open .ace compressed file on macOS? I tried searching for solutions but haven't come across any method to extract it yet.\n\nA: Shameless plug: With acefile there is now a python based solution to uncompress ACE archives, that is slow, but works on OS X.  Simply make sure you have Python 3 and then install acefile:\npip3 install acefile\n\nThen you will have the acefile-unace utility installed, that you can use to extract ACE archives, including the newer ACE 2.0 format that is not supported by most archivers with ACE support on platforms other than Windows.  Run something like:\nacefile-unace -x example.ace\n\nYou may have to explicitly give the bin path of your python installation if you don't have that in your PATH (e.g. /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/).\n\nA: You have the following three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Unarchiver, which supports only older ACE archives (not created with WinAce). It is available either as a direct download, or from the Mac App Store (with further restrictions/sandboxing).\n\n*RAR, which can decompress ACE archives. On macOS, it is only available as a command-line utility. As I recall, it supports WinAce archives.\n\n*MacUnace from the makers of WinAce. Note that this is a very old executable, dating back to 2003. Compatibility is not guaranteed. And beware that some versions of WinAce used to ship with bundled adware.\n\n\nA: The commandline Mac version of RAR does not do .ace files, even if the author's site says their GUI Windows one (WinRAR) can.  I just tried: \"cait_farm.ace is not RAR archive\". (Nice grammar, there.) I've tried both their freeware version and their trial commercial version.\nIt's correct that The Unarchiver can't handle WinAce files; its failure is why I came looking.\nMacUnace doesn't run on modern Macs, nor (obviously) will the GUI wrapper for it, UnaceX.  Seems our only option is to take the .ace to a Windows box, or run Windows in a virtual machine to do it (I keep a Win7 VM around for tasks like this, but it's a hassle.)\nUPDATE: The python-based acefile utility mentioned by Daniel Roethlisberger here, after a minor patch made in response to a bug report of mine a while back, is now working like a charm on every single .ACE file I have thrown at it, including the \"extended\" version of the format.  We have a winner!\n\nA: Just use Boxer (http://boxerapp.com/) and the original ACE (http://www.winace.com/files/ace26.exe)\n", "Q: .cshrc got empitied, aliases are loaded in opened terminal, how to retrieve them? accidentally my .cshrc file got deleted, which had many aliases. I have terminal tab opened in my linux machine, which has all these aliases loaded in it. How can i retrieve it so that i could write them back to .cshrc file and get it back? \n\nA: From the manual, it seems that alias should list all of the aliases in the currently running shell:\n\nalias [name [wordlist]]\nWithout arguments, prints all aliases.  With name, prints the\n  alias for name.  With name and wordlist, assigns wordlist as\n  the alias of name.  wordlist is command and filename\n  substituted.  name may not be alias' orunalias'.

Some application called \"CodeBox\" (website).  If I try to perform the update, it tells me it is linked to another account and thus cannot perform it. But I can't remove it neither, as it is nowhere to be found on my machine!\nI tried to find it via a full text search: grep \"CodeBox\" -R -l / but it only showed a few irrelevant files.\nAlso tried:\n- mdfind \"CodeBox\"``\n-softwareupdate -l` (returns \"no new software available).\nNote that this is a legit version of Mac Os X (some forums threads say it could come from a cracked version of Mac Os X found on torrent sites).\nI'm at loss here. Any idea?\n\nA: Its not in a backup on an external drive? As I've seen that before an application in a backup of a old users home folder that showed there were updates even though the applications were not installed on the Mac. Removed the external drive and the App Store no longer showed any available updates. Then deleted the old backup on the external drive so it wouldn't prompt again.\n", "Q: Can a 2012 Macbook Pro run a 4k display? I was thinking about getting a 4k display for photo and video editing. I just edit 1080p video and that was never a problem on my mid 2012 mbp non-retina with i5 and 8gb ram. It also was never a problem when I had a external 1080p display hooked up to it with a thunderbolt to hdmi adapter. Can the macbook run a 4k display even for basic tasks like web browsing and some stuff in sketch and affinity designer?\n\nA: According to Everymac that machine can only run an external screen up to 2560x1600.\n\nA: I run a 2012 non Retina MBP El Capitan and use a Moshi TB to HDMI adapter to run my Samsung 4K 40\" TV at 4K. The only problem is sometimes it is finicky reconnecting after putting the Mac in sleep mode or turning off the TV power. I have to plug/unplug the cables several times. \nHowever it is a great setup with lots of desktop room which is great when I work with music in Sibelius. I can see a big chunk of the score at once and I can magnify web pages, word docs, etc. so I can see the print much more easily.\n4K at a foot away!\n", "Q: Refresh Calendar.app with correct Exchange-account data In the Calendar.app on OS X I sync some calendars with an Exchange-account. When I look at the same calendar in Outlook all calendar items seems to be correct, but in the Calendar.app some items has the wrong date. I would like the Calendar.app to refresh so that it is equal to what I can see in the Outlook calendar, but normal Refresh does not help.\nAre there any workaround that could fix such an issue?\n\nA: For me the solution was: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open in Finder by running open ~/Library/Calendars in Terminal\n\n*Look for a folder that ends with .exchange. Open it.\n\n*Find the correct Exchange calendar by looking at the Info.plist files in each of the .calendar folders. Open the Events folder.\n\n*If you know that the problem is recent, sort all files by Date Modified. Set Cover Flow mode for showing the files in Finder\n\n*By looking at the items in Finder, Skip through the ics-files to search for the item that has the wrong date.\n\n*\"Move to Trash\" the incorrect item\n\n*Start the Calendar.app\n\n\nI guess that it might be possible to \"Move to trash\" the .calendar folder for a full refresh of everything, but for me it was not necessary.\n", "Q: iCloud Photo Library and storage usage on devices I am considering to use one of Apples iCloud plans.\nI read that photos and videos on the devices are \"lightweight versions\" using less storage (at least if you configure it that way).\nBut let's say I have 200 GB of cloud storage filled with 190 GB of pictures, how can my iPhone with 16 GB handle that? (Assuming 16GB are not enough for the \"lightweight versions\" of the photos)\nAm I getting device storage warnings and alike?\nThanks.\n\nA: It is not a lightweight version it's more like a preview and then when you're connected to the internet you have access to the photo in full resolution. Your iPhone will let some space to the photos it will just optimise the storage, not all photos will be in the cloud. But I'm not sure if it can handle 200Gb but some space in your iPhone will be used depending on how frequently you access your photos in the cloud.\n", "Q: How to Set, Use iOS 10.2 Parental Controls on iPhone 7 Plus i want to be safe from my child use my iPhone, what i have to do? To restrict my device running on iOS 10.2?\n\nA: What exactly do you want to restrict?\nYou can restrict apps:\nSettings > General > Restrictions > Select app.\nYou can restrict websites, content:\nSettings > General > Restrictions > Allowed content.\nYou can set a Password:\nSettings > Touch ID & Passcode.\nOr you can use third part apps that block specific content and apps.\n\nA: You can also use the learning mode to keep your child within a specific app, like a puzzle or game that you allow it to play.\nSettings > General > Accesibility > Learning\nEnable Guided access.\nConfigure a passcode\nOptionally configure Time limits.\nNow open the app your kid wants to use/play, triple-click the home button\n- select the area that may be clickable\n- select the hardware buttons that are allowed (volume is a good one :))\n- click start.\nYou kid can now only use that specific app, without leaving it.\nTo exit this mode, just triple-click home and enter the configured passcode.\nI use this all the time with my kids (also on iPad).\nCheers\n", "Q: Logging into iCloud on a Network Managed user account If I log into a Mac at my uni, then I log on as a network user, so none of my files are actually stored on the Mac and I can log on to any machine and anyone can log into their account on this Mac.\nIs it safe to log into iCloud in this case, as in noone else will be able to access it after I log out? Will it try and sync my entire iCloud Drive to this Mac?\n\nA: Personally, I wouldn't add your personal iCloud account to a shared Mac. It can be done but you would need to set it up to not sync anything to the Mac and by doing that you are using iCloud in the way it was really designed to be used. Plus you would need to sign out each time for security. You would be better off accessing your iCloud account on a web browser.\n", "Q: How do I emulate iOS Clash Royale on Windows? I have no experience with apple devices. How do I emulate iOS Clash Royale on windows? i mean, emulating Clash royale but the ios one.\n\nA: You can't. \nThere is no emulation software for Windows to run iOS apps.\nEven on Mac you must have the source code, you cannot run a compiled app.\n", "Q: Restricted Messaging My daughter has an iphone and I would like to restrict when and who she can text with.  I'm aware that you can turn off the messaging completely but that's not wanted.

This site can show you how to do that while using Restrictions to prevent your daughter from making changes.\nThere are some 3rd-party applications that might be able to do what you want.  Search the App Store for messaging apps that have that feature.\n", "Q: Revert to El Capitan I'm having major 'disagreements' with Sierra, compatibility issues with software etc, & have decided to revert to El Capitan.\nI have done this many times in the past, tested an OS then gone back to the earlier version. I make a clone of the old drive, then update; clone back after a few days & all is well. Most I lose is a few non-essential emails which doesn't bother me.\nThis time, I've left it too long to do that.\nMy clone is 2 weeks old, my POP email will only sync back one day. I have no real trace of what else may have changed in that period, but let's say with the best of intentions I'll miss something that I later discover I should have made a safety of.\nI have Time Machine, up to date, but of course it's now syncing Sierra.\nI also have Backblaze.\nSo ultimately I should have the resources to go back & find anything I may have missed.\nMy worry is if I use a clean install & migrate from Time Machine, some old authorisations on the drive will be lost. Some cannot be retrieved if they break because the servers that authorised them no longer exist. [Old pro audio plugins etc, still working but no longer supported.] These survive a clone, but I don't know if they'd survive a migrate. [I didn't migrate from my old 3,1 to this 5,1, I just moved the boot drive from the old to the new machine.]\nI have all old installers in my Purchase History, so obtaining El Capitan is not an issue.\nI'm on a Mac Pro 5,1 so dropping in a spare drive is no problem, if that would help.\nI've never tested whether this machine will boot from USB, my older 3,1 never would - I shall test that & update the question.\nEdit I've tested, it will successfully boot from an El Capitan installer USB.\nI've also made a clone of the boot drive as it is right now, belt & braces.\nI see my options as...\n1. Restore from the clone & try to find anything I missed.\n2. Nuke & pave, then migrate Time Machine  \nIs there a 3rd option?\nSome method to restore to my current backup, but sitting on El Capitan rather than Sierra?\nLate Edit\nWell, option 2 just went away. The installer simply refuses to migrate from a newer OS to an older one, whether from a mounted or remote drive, or Time Machine.\nRestore Mavericks from Time Machine may help future Googlers too.\n\nA: Next time I'll remember to set my POP3 server to keep mails for a month before I ever upgrade again :/\nSimplest solution seems to have been to re-clone back from my two-week-old El Capitan clone - the one I made right before the upgrade.\nThat successfully took me back to El Capitan - but from 2 weeks ago.\nThat left me with having to remember/pick through what had been changed in the past two weeks.\nCarbon Copy Cloner makes a Safety Net folder containing older versions - though in this case it was more useful for finding newer versions of apps I'd updated in the meantime.\nMainly what it had dumped in there was \"Sierra\".\nMy most important stuff was my photography folder, so I simply copied that in its entirety from a safety copy [yesterday's Sierra clone].\nA Parallels VM I knew I had been working on I did the same.\nBecause Mail had changed its library structure I lost two weeks of relatively unimportant emails - I can live with that.  If I remember anything hugely important I can boot to my Sierra clone & forward it to myself.\nTime Machine proved to be completely useless in that respect. It claimed to be able to restore missing emails, but as everything in the past two weeks was in a newer format, it couldn't actually find anything.\nSo, job done. It actually took about 45 mins in all; once I'd figured out the structure & the potential sacrifice.\nThe moral of the story... sometimes two clones & two complete backups still isn't enough to get back all data.\nI'm still open to alternative suggestions.\nI'm in a position to simply repeat the process, as I still have copies of all the 'originals'.\n\nA: You could look into using an installation of El Captain on a separate partition, which should give you access to your files and enable you to test what you can successfully migrate to that OS if you need to, if not (and providing your partition is large enough) you could likely just boot to (and use) El Captain from there.  I encourage you to do some additional reading before you jump in.\n...be sure to back your data up first, I believe this would be essentially a non-destructive effort.\n", "Q: How to manage a large number of external servers mount paths? During my typical workflow I need to connect to 10 to 15 different servers (samba and ftp), depending on the work I am doing. Usually I press cmd + K in the Finder and select one of them in my Favorites list. Some of the servers I also placed in the sidebar's Favorites to connect to them quicker. However, this is also awkward as the list in my sidebar is already rather long and some servers have the same name, which cannot be changed there.\nCan you recommend a better workflow or a tool when working with a large number of servers? \n\nA: You can create aliases and put those anywhere. In Finder, navigate to a shared folder or any path inside, then create an alias. You can create an alias by ⇧⌘-dragging a folder.\nYou can place this alias anywhere in any hierarchy, such as a folder in your documents, and when opening the alias, Finder will resolve the alias and connect to the relevant server.\n                                \n", "Q: How to fix an accidentally created Apple CoreStorage Volume, LVG, Logical Volume Group (broken partitions) I used Unetbootin and accidentally chose a partition on my HDD to install the Lubuntu Live-USB I wanted to create on an USB Stick.\nNow, my HDD looks like this \n\nI can boot into Mac OS X and everything works fine. \nThis is a 4TB SHDD.

(I might make exceptions, but I'll decide that on a file-by-file basis as needed.)\n(However, I do need to be logged in to iCloud for some things, so just turning off iCloud won't work.)\nHow can I accomplish that?\nI found the dialog below, but the options are ambiguous.\nIt isn't clear to me what unchecking those boxes and then clicking \"store in iCloud\" will do. Because what I'm trying to do is not store in iCloud. Where is the option for that?\n\n\nA: Optimized Storage isn't a single feature you can turn off in a single place; it's a bunch of similar features that you'll need to check and (if necessary) turn off individually. That Manage Storage window you got to from About This Mac is designed to let you turn on various Optimized Storage features, but not really useful to check their status or turn them off.\nThere's a good explanation by Adam Engst in two articles over at TidBITS: Explaining Sierra’s Optimized Storage and How to Turn Off Sierra’s Optimized Storage. I'll attempt to summarize.\n\n\n*\n\n*Files: in System Preferences > iCloud pane > iCloud Drive Options button > deselect \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" (to prevent those folders from being stored in iCloud) and \"Optimize Mac Storage\" (to prevent deletion of local copies of the documents you do explicitly store in iCloud).\nAfter closing that Options dialog, turn off any other kinds of that you don't want to have synced with to iCloud. Note, however, that for some of these data types, you can enable them here and then use the relevant app to choose which items get stored locally and which are synced.\n\n*Trash: In Finder, choose Finder menu > Preferences > Advanced tab > deselect \"Remove items from the Trash after 30 days\".\n\n*Photos: if you turned off iCloud's Photos feature in the iCloud preferences, you're done. If you want iCloud to store and share photos, but not delete local copies, you need to go into the Photos app, choose Photos menu > Preferences > iCloud tab > deselect \"Optimize Mac Storage\".\nNote that Adam recommends that if you do use iCloud to share photos across your devices, you should have one Mac set to \"Download Originals to this Mac\" and not to \"Optimize Mac Storage\", and then make sure that Mac gets backed up. Seems like good advice to me.\n\n*Email attachments: in the Mail app, choose Mail > Preferences (not \"Accounts\"!) > Accounts tab, then for each account do Account Information tab > Download Attachments pop-up menu > choose \"All\".\n\n*Videos in iTunes: in the iTunes app, choose iTunes > Preferences > Advanced tab > deselect \"Automatically delete watched movies and TV shows\".\n", "Q: Connect 2 LG Ultrafine 5K monitors plugged into the same side of late 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch I have a late 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch that, to my knowledge has 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports (two on each side). I have two LG Ultrafine 5K monitors. When I connect them to one port on either side of the computer, they work just fine and I can see them connected to individual Thunderbolt buses in my system information:\n\nWhen I connect them to the ports on the same side, I get no picture in one of them. Doesn't matter which one, whichever I connect second, doesn't get a picture. But, my system information shows them both connected to a Thunderbolt bus. \n\nHas anybody tried this? I realize that the one bus may not have the bandwidth, but it was my understanding that this particular model has 4 fully functional thunderbolt 3 ports and it looks like each display is getting the necessary bandwidth.\n\n\nSource\nAlthough now that I'm looking at that diagram, it shows one display on each side of the computer, ha!\n\nA: What you're seeing is the correct behaviour.\nEach 5K monitor actually uses 2 DisplayPort 1.2 streams and stiches them together to form a single image.\nYou have two DisplayPort streams available per Thunderbolt 3 bus, so plugging in a 5K monitor on the left hand side of the MacBook Pro occupies all the DisplayPort capacity available on that side.\nThis means that you need to plug one monitor into the left hand side and the other into the right hand side of the MacBook Pro. \nIt also means that MacBook Pros with only 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports only supports a single 5K monitor.\n", "Q: Is it possible to display all of the Service titles in the context menu? When one has more than three Services in a context menu, what occurs is that they are automatically kept within a \"Services\" sub-menu. The user then must hover over this sub-menu before they may click on the desired Service title.\nIs it possible to show all 4 Service titles in the context menu?\n\nA: To show all Services on the Context Menu in Finder, do the following.\nIn Terminal, use the following commands:\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences NSServicesMinimumItemCountForContextSubmenu -int 100001\nkillall -HUP Finder\n\nNow all applicable Services in Finder's Context Menu should appear without being in a Services Sub Menu.\nTo revert to default behavior, use the following commands in Terminal:\ndefaults delete .GlobalPreferences NSServicesMinimumItemCountForContextSubmenu\nkillall -HUP Finder\n\nNote: I've only tested this in OS X 10.8.5 and OS X 10.11.6 and it worked in both, so I'd assume it should work in the OS X versions in between. I've also tested this it in macOS 10.12.2 and it works, so I'd assume other versions of macOS 10.12.x it should work.\nUpdate Note: This should also have an affect on other Context Menus in Applications other then Finder. However, applications that are running at the time this change is made must be restarted for this to take effect. After this change has been made, applications opened afterwards will be affected immediately.  You can also just logout/login for the change to take effect globally, all at once.\n", "Q: Secure erase ssd with Snow leopard (10.6.8) I want to return my crucial mx300 to amazon, but first I have to secure erase all data on it. I don't have any particularly sensitive files, I'm worried mainly about passwords. Unfortunately I have snow leopard (10.6.8) installed on it, so it won't be possible to use FileVault. Searching in the answers to similar questions I found this method which could be handy in my case: \n\"I found a workaround. Restart the computer and hold option to enter the setup screen. Go into disk utility and select the drive. Erase the drive using \"Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted). Make a password for the encryption, it doesn't matter what it is because you won't need it. Hit \"Erase\". Now select the volume and the \"Erase Free Space\" and \"Security Options\" buttons should no longer be grayed out. Click and select your level of security and off you go. I presume \"Erase Free Space\" and \"Security Options\" should do the same thing because you just erased the drive so all space is considered free. This worked for me so let me know if it helps.\"\nWill it be enough? Do you know other methods I can use?\nThank you\n\nA: Apple removed the secure erase from SSD since they do not work like HDD where you can command a secure erase. THe best you can do is fill the drive up with some other data and reduce the portion of the memory cells that still contain unerased and original data. \nTHe NAND controller in SSD is the only way to ensure all cells are properly sanitized, so you would need a manufacturer specific utility to force all of the cells to be over-written with whatever data the manufacturer recommends.\nDepending on why you are erasing, you would spend the time to get a custom tool or just copy new data on the drive or choose to physically destroy the SSD to prevent any recovery of the data.\nGoing forward, the only way to secure data on an SSD is to encrypt the data before it is written and then destroy the cryptographic key that can decrypt the data. No erasure of the data is needed, just key destruction.\nIn your case, you might just load Rick Ashley videos from YouTube and then change any passwords you really cannot afford to lose to some unique value so that in the remote chance a hacker gets your SSD and recovers data - they would only get to accounts you can fix later.\n", "Q: Services bug that prematurely activates an application I have discovered a very strange bug with Services.\nTo witness this behavior, please do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that Safari is in your Dock.\n\n*Open Automator. Create a new Service.\n\n*Set the service to receive \"no input\" in \"any application.\"\n\n*Insert a \"Run AppleScript\" action.\n\n*Paste the following into the action:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    delay 5\n    display dialog \"Hello\"      \n    tell application \"Safari\" to activate\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\n*Save the Service.\n\n*Close the Service.\n\n*Re-open the Service.\n\n*Automator should present you with a dialog asking, \"Do you want to install the “ServiceName” service?\" Click \"Install.\"\n\n*When given the \"Installation complete\" dialog, click \"Done.\"\nNow, run the Service. To do this, click on the current-application title in the top-left corner of the screen (the second item in the menu bar). Then click on the Service title.\nYou will notice that Safari will immediately open (evidenced by the black dot underneath its logo in the Dock). Safari will open before the 5 second delay and before the \"Hello\" dialog is displayed.\nPlacing the activate statement in a subroutine does not fix the issue.\nCan someone confirm that this is a bug? I am convinced that this is a bug with the Services feature because when you run the Service from within Automator (by clicking the \"play\" button in the top-right corner of the Automator window), the code runs correctly.\nIf this is a bug, does anyone have a workaround so that the application is not in fact opened before the previous code runs?\n\nMy Macbook Pro is running OS X El Capitan, 10.11.6.\n\nThe bug might be related to another piece of strange behavior that I noticed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit out of Safari.app and Automator.app, if they are running.\n\n*Pull up the folder where the computer's Services are stored (/Users/Me/Library/Services/) in Finder.\n\n*Right-click the Service file and open the file with Automator.\nYou will notice that opening the .workflow file with Automator will activate Safari. It shouldn't do that.\n\nA: The only workaround I've found after testing several different scenarios is to wrap the Safari commands within a do shell script command, e.g. do shell script \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Safari\\\" to activate'\". Note that with osascript, multiple −e options may be given to build up a multi-line script.\nFrom the manual page for osascript:\n\n−e statement\nEnter one line of a script. If −e is given, osascript will not look for a filename in the argument list. Multiple −e options may be given to build up a multi-line script. Because most scripts use characters that are special to many shell programs (e.g., AppleScript uses single and double quote marks, “(”, “)”, and “*”), the statement will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell intact.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    activate\n    make new document in front\n    set URL of front document to \"http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271133/services-bug-that-prematurely-activates-an-application\"\nend tell\n\nAn example of the AppleScript code above, written as a do shell script command using osascript with the -e option, as necessary.\ndo shell script \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Safari\\\"' -e 'activate' -e 'make new document in front' -e 'set URL of front document to \\\"http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271133/services-bug-that-prematurely-activates-an-application\\\"' -e 'end tell'\"\n\nAs you can see, each line of AppleScript code from the normal tell block statement is its own -e option, and as noted in the manual page for osascript with the -e option, escaping with a backslash has been done as necessary for the code to compile correctly before being run.\nIn other words, this turn the normal tell block statement and its included commands to a one-line do shell script command so as to circumvent the apparent bug in the use case scenario presented in the OP.\nNote that you should be able to do similar with other applications triggered by the same bug, by substituting the appropriate application name (and commands) as needed.\n", "Q: Can i sell a phone that has been previously jailbroken, but restored, back to my carrier? I have an iPhone 6s that i'd like to jailbreak, but it is locked to a carrier. I wouldn't be unlocking it, as id like to sell it back to the carrier at some point in time. Is it possible for me to jailbreak, use tweaks and mods for a while, then restore my phone and sell it back?\n\nA: Sure; provided that you don't brick it accidentally, restoring it in iTunes will remove any evidence that it was ever jailbroken.  When I bought my 6+, the 5S I sent back to the carrier had been jailbroken the entire time I owned it.  I restored it to factory before sending it back and no one mentioned anything.  Same thing when I updated from the 6+ to the 6S+.  Restored the 6+ and the carrier didn't complain.\n\nA: Jailbreaking does violate your phone's warranty. If that is a condition of your agreement, then yes, it will impact your ability to do so.\nAlso, make sure that you don't install and tweaks or mods that brick your phone or mess with data, etc. \nOtherwise, you should be fine, but I'd check with your carrier to be extra sure.

I've researched methods on how to get the selection as a text variable in an AppleScript. But these methods rely on copying the selection to the clipboard (for example, by keystroking the copy command at the top of the script) in order to introduce this text to the AppleScript (by using the clipboard).\nThis is less than ideal, of course, because the actual clipboard text is overwritten.\nIs there another way to get the selected text, system-wide, in AppleScript, without disturbing the clipboard?\nObviously, one can easily get the selected text without touching the clipboard in Automator. However, in this case, I don't want to use Automator; I need a pure AppleScript solution.\n\nA: Here is a recent blog post that focuses on this very mission:\nMichael Tsai - Blog - Processing the Selected Text via Script\nOne way to get the currently selected text into an AppleScript, without overwriting the clipboard contents, is to simply save the clipboard contents to a new variable before the selected text is copied. Then, at the end of the script, place the original clipboard contents back onto the clipboard.\nHere is what this might look like:\n-- Back up clipboard contents:\nset savedClipboard to the clipboard\n\n-- Copy selected text to clipboard:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}\ndelay 1 -- Without this, the clipboard may have stale data.\n\nset theSelectedText to the clipboard\n\n-- Makes the selected text all uppercase:\n-- From: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171196/184907\nset theModifiedSelectedText to (do shell script (\"echo \" & theSelectedText & \" | tr a-z A-Z;\"))\n\n-- Overwrite the old selection with the desired text:\nset the clipboard to theModifiedSelectedText\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using {command down}\ndelay 0.1 -- Without this delay, may restore clipboard before pasting.\n\n-- Instead of the above three lines, you could instead use:\n--      tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke theModifiedSelectedText\n-- But this way is a little slower.\n\n-- Restore clipboard:\nset the clipboard to savedClipboard\n\nBut, this method is imperfect, as Michael notes:\n\nThis is ugly and has some downsides: there are delays necessitated by the GUI scripting, and certain types of clipboard data are not preserved.\n\n\nHowever, Shane Stanley left a comment on the blog post with a method to retain the original formatting of the clipboard contents.\nIf using the previous example, replace the first line with:\nset savedClipboard to my fetchStorableClipboard()\n\nReplace the last line with:\nmy putOnClipboard:savedClipboard\n\nAnd add the following code to the end:\nuse AppleScript version \"2.4\"\nuse scripting additions\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse framework \"AppKit\"\n\n\non fetchStorableClipboard()\n    set aMutableArray to current application's NSMutableArray's array() -- used to store contents\n    -- get the pasteboard and then its pasteboard items\n    set thePasteboard to current application's NSPasteboard's generalPasteboard()\n    -- loop through pasteboard items\n    repeat with anItem in thePasteboard's pasteboardItems()\n        -- make a new pasteboard item to store existing item's stuff\n        set newPBItem to current application's NSPasteboardItem's alloc()'s init()\n        -- get the types of data stored on the pasteboard item\n        set theTypes to anItem's types()\n        -- for each type, get the corresponding data and store it all in the new pasteboard item\n        repeat with aType in theTypes\n            set theData to (anItem's dataForType:aType)'s mutableCopy()\n            if theData is not missing value then\n                (newPBItem's setData:theData forType:aType)\n            end if\n        end repeat\n        -- add new pasteboard item to array\n        (aMutableArray's addObject:newPBItem)\n    end repeat\n    return aMutableArray\nend fetchStorableClipboard\n\n\non putOnClipboard:theArray\n    -- get pasteboard\n    set thePasteboard to current application's NSPasteboard's generalPasteboard()\n    -- clear it, then write new contents\n    thePasteboard's clearContents()\n    thePasteboard's writeObjects:theArray\nend putOnClipboard:\n\nI've tested this solution provided by Shane, and it does indeed retain all of the original formatting of the clipboard contents if you have rich text on the clipboard.\n\nShane later left a second comment, this time with the intent of minimizing the runtime of the script.\nReplace this code:\n-- Copy selected text to clipboard:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}\ndelay 1 -- Without this, the clipboard may have stale data.\n\nwith this code:\nset thePasteboard to current application's NSPasteboard's generalPasteboard()\nset theCount to thePasteboard's changeCount()\n-- Copy selected text to clipboard:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}\n-- Check for changed clipboard:\nrepeat 20 times\n    if thePasteboard's changeCount() is not theCount then exit repeat\n    delay 0.1\nend repeat\n\nI tested this new code and I did find that the script was in fact noticeably faster, just by a hair.\n\nOverall, this is not a bad workaround. The contents of the clipboard are preserved and the delay is much less noticeable if you employ the code provided in Shane's second comment.\nI tested the solution against a Service created in Automator.app that receives the selected text as the input. The Service and the pure AppleScript solution pretty much took equal amounts of time to complete (i.e, about one second).\n\nIf one wants a method to get and replace the selected text without having to touch the clipboard, Michael suggests in his blog post that one can utilize a piece of third-party software entitled LaunchBar. However, this is \"cheating,\" because, at that point, we have moved beyond the scope of my original question, which is strictly concerned about AppleScript.\n", "Q: AppleScript: Get Image Location Data I am trying to write an Automator Script which involves, among other things, getting the GPS location data from an image. This will be a Finder Service.\nFrom what I have been able to discover so far, it involves running some AppleScript and talking to the Image Events headless application.\nFrom here, how do I actually get the Latitude & Longitude of the image?\nI know there are applications which can read this data, including on the command line, but I wondered whether it was available to MacOS without adding anything.\n\nA: I do not believe Image Events is able to get that type of meta data from the photo however mdls can do it, e.g. mdls -name kMDItemLatitude -name kMDItemLongitude /path/to/photo however it all depends what exactly your trying to do with this info. I personally prefer using exiftool however you'd have to install it.\nTo answer the question in your comment:\nIf you query an attributeName when using -raw and the attributeName doesn't exist the output is literally (null) and if you want it to be something else then use −nullMarker markerString, e.g.: −nullMarker \"Does Not Exist\"\nmdls -name kMDItemFake -raw -nullMarker \"Does Not Exist\" /path/to/photo\n\nIn the example command above kMDItemFake is a fake kMDItem item, so that command will output: Does Not Exist instead of (null).\nIn other words, if as example the photo doesn't have kMDItemLatitude info and you query for it the output will be (null) when using mdls -name kMDItemLatitude -raw. To change that, use −nullMarker markerString.\nIf a kMDItem doesn't exist and you want no output when using mdls -name attar -raw then use mdls -name attar -raw −nullMarker '' /path/to/photo.\n", "Q: Split Input Channels Using SoundFlower and AULab I want to split my stereo input channels so I can Eq one of them. They both would then go to the built-in output. I've installed SoundFloser and AU Lab on Mac OS 10.12 Sierra. I've read through the help pages for AU lab. I couldn't find anything specific to my need. With all the options, it looks like it should be possible. I've tried selecting two mono inputs. I get two left channels as input. I didn't see any way to change the source of the mono input, but I could have missed it.\n\nA: It could be done using Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack which is ostensibly an audio recorder but has really comprehensive routing capabilities too.\nYou build your path just by drag & drop, it makes the connections for you.\nRoute a source to two different Channels plugins, kill left in one & kill right in

I recently updated to macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Beta (16E144f) and it might be what is causing sudo to delay up to 10 minutes as it's the most recent change I recall since this problem occurred. I have never had to wait so long for a basic program and something is clearly wrong. The command eventually succeeds, but after waiting way too long.\nI've been using this question as a reference. So far, I've tried adding my hostname to the end of the 127.0.0.1 line in /etc/hosts as well as. I checked /etc/resolv.conf and I did have some extra entries from when I was on a network that needed manual DNS entries, but I removed them and there has been no difference. I used the networksetup -setdnsservers command to restore the original values. Internet still works fine but still a very slow sudo.\nI tried the logger 'test' command thinking it would write to /var/log/system.log, but it looks like it totally deleted that file although it was soon made anew.\nI was hoping to use the strace command to see what was happening while sudo ran but that command is not available on OS X.

I just purchased an AirPort Time Capsule and set up backups of my OS X Sierra. (Actually, they're going to a USB drive connected to it but I think it amounts to the same thing.)\nIf leave for work with my laptop in the middle of a backup, will Time Machine handle that gracefully and do something sane or will it have a meltdown and corrupt the backup and all the other backups and become unusable?\n\nA: Time Machine should handle this gracefully, with the in-progress backup continuing the next time you connect.\nI have many many Time Machine backups that have all been done over wifi, and I have honestly paid no attention to whether or not backups are in progress or complete while taking my laptop in and out of the house.\n\nA: Time machine backs up periodically.

The program is called uhubctl, and allows you to toggle and cycle power on individual ports for supported USB hubs.\nAs the description would imply, you'll need to know which USB port the device in question is connected to (or cycle the entire hub if you're confident it won't cause and issues with other peripherals), and I still recommend using diskutil eject diskX (or sudo umount /dev/sdX for Linux and umount diskX for BSD) before power cycling the port to ensure that the device unmounts cleanly.\nuhubctl home page is here (you can get source code using git clone https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl).\nYou'll need to compile it from source one way or another, either with make or via brew. By far easiest way to install it in one swoop with brew:\nbrew tap mvp/uhubctl https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl  \nbrew install uhubctl\n\nTested and can confirm working with both Apple and 3rd party USB hubs on macOS 10.13-10.15, and on macOS 11 Big Sur too (including M1 Macs).\n", "Q: Can I safely remove a broken recovery partition?

When I connect the second one, the system freezes up and the second monitor stays blank.\nMy research suggests that the MacBook Pro 2015's GPU is meant to support one DisplayPort monitor plus its own screen - but can I configure it to use two DisplayPort monitors and not use its own screen?\n(There are lots of similar questions but I couldn't find one that specifically deals with 2x DisplayPort cables)\n\nA: I found conflicting information about this subject, so for the sake of clarity for anyone asking the same question:\n\n\n*\n\n*As per the comment @James left on @Bret's answer, the Mid 2015 MacBook Pro with Intel Iris graphics CANNOT drive two DisplayPort monitors simultaneously, so it is not possible to run two external 4K displays at 60Hz. This was tested on the 15\" model with standard Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cables.\n\n*You can however run one 4K display at 60Hz through a DisplayPort and a second 4K display through the HDMI port at 30Hz.\n\n\nA: With the 15\" MacBook Pro with Iris Pro integrated graphics, you may use 2 External Displays along with the current Mac Display\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays\nSource: Apple\n\n", "Q: Isn't XCode meant to be free? I have a Mac running 10.7 Lion. I have the lastest compatible XCode installed but it isn't able to work with my iOS 10 iPad. It will work with my old iOS 6 iPod. I wrote an extremely basic app which compiled successfully and ran fine in the virtual device, however the system won't let me run or install the app on my iPod. I see I have a certificate issue and to obtain one I need to be part of the Apple Developer Programme.\nI'm guessing that in the latest release of XCode this won't be an issue, and I can make apps and run them on my iPad for free as long as its for personal use. I know my Mac can't run Sierra but if I got hold of one which could would this be the case?\nI don't want to have to pay a £99 per year Apple Dev Prog fee.\n\nA: The actual problem is that side loading of apps without needing an Apple signed certificate was added to iOS 8. You'll want to upgrade your iOS and Mac OS to get to the level where Xcode can self-sign and self run based on your free AppleID instead of a paid and signed developer certificate.\nIt that fails, you would have to get a newer device to use the free entitlement of running code you self-sign and side load from Xcode.\n\nA: XCode as an application is free. A developer account is £/$99/year.\n", "Q: Is Xcode 7.3 compatible with Homebrew on Sierra? I am a beginner and while attempting to get my Macbook Pro (early 2011, 4 GB RAM) ready for an online class (Python for DNA sequencing data analysis) I apparently did something wrong.  I first downloaded Xcode (v7) from the App store.  I chose version 7 because a friend said version 8 was crashing on him and also I've read that one may have both versions if they are placed in different folders.  I agreed to the Xcode licence then installed Homebrew by running the script from the Homebrew website in Terminal. It installed successfully.  Next I tried to insert the Homebrew directory at the top of path.  I did this by first creating a .bash_profile file, opened the file and inserted: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH.  This is when everything froze and I could not restart or force quit.  Waited for the power to die then recharged.  The computer is very slow now and Preview will not quit (tried many ways to force quit).  Preview will not allow a restart or shutdown.  Is problem from downloading the wrong version of software, or perhaps from messing with the Path?  Any ideas to solve the immediate issue with Preview and overall software installation guidance would be much appreciated.     \n\nA: For starters, if you were editing the .bash_profile in your user folder it should not be able to cause system-wide issues, the most you would experience is a lack of ability to run software installed by Homebrew if you mistyped the line. To be safe though, I would remove this line from your bash profile if possible. Homebrew auto-links software it installs into the /usr/bin/ and /opt/local/ directories, so you don't have to add anything to the $PATH for ot to work properly. \nAs far as Xcode goes I am on Sierra and version 8 has worked fine for me, but version 7 was extremely glitchy when I was running El Capitan. Not to mention that version 8 is about half the size of version 7, so I would recommend uninstalling version 7 and replacing it with version 8.\nWith Homebrew in particular there is the issue that it requires both the Xcode app, and the Xcode command line tools (a quick search will reveal how to install them from the Terminal) so if you don't have both it could cause issues.\nFinally do you have System Integrity Protection disabled? Some features of Xcode require root to run, and the Xcode app is allowed to make changes to the system, even if SIP is enabled. Homebrew on the other hand requires root permission to install properly but will be denied access to modify the core system if SIP is enabled, so its possible that Homebrew made some system modifications through Xcode, some modifications to the non-SIP-protected root folders, and was denied access to modify the SIP-protected root folders, resulting in a half modified, partially linked and generally unstable system. You can check if SIP is enabled (if you don't know) by running the command csrutil in the terminal. If it is enabled, and you have a recent time machine backup, I would recommend rebooting to your recovery partition, restoring your system with the backup, opening a terminal while in the recovery, running csrutil disable, and rebooting to macOS. From there install the Xcode command line tools if you don't have them, and try the process again with Xcode 8 instead. While this isn't for sure the issue, SIP can cause problems when used with software that modifies the system, and seeing as how you have enough IT know-how to be installing Xcode and a command line package manager in the first place I recommend disabling it to be safe as a rule.\n", "Q: Is a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo better than a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz? I think my 2008 Macbook is about to bite the dust and wanted to buy a new Macbook Pro.....I noticed that I have the option to purchase a 2.0GHz processor which has a 3.1GHz \"turbo boost\".  Would the turbo boost make this a better/faster processor?  I will be using the Macbook mainly to run Logic Pro along with music plugins.\n\nA: Don't be fooled by the Ghz. The i5-6360U is in the Late 2016 13\" MacBook Pro and is a Skylake CPU. I assume your 2008 MacBook Pro is a 15\" model, as the 13\" did not ship with that CPU.\nThe newer i5 machine has a Geekbench score of 3609 vs 1320 for the Late 2008 MacBook Pro 15\". \nNot only that, but the newer Mac features better graphics (even integrated graphics), built in SSD, etc. If  you still have a hard drive in your old Mac, the SSD alone will shock you in performance improvements for your Mac.\nGeekBench\nUpdate: I see some additional questions in the comments about how a 2 Ghz processor can 'beat' a 2.4 Ghz processor. One thing to note is that the transition at Intel from Pentium to Core Duo essentially ended the Ghz wars. Intel found the adding cores, reducing heat and improving cacheing improved performance more than Ghz. This really showed when their mobile CPUs were beating out their desktop CPUs, so Intel switched to their 'mobile architecture' for everything, thus Core and Core Duo.  The i Series are built on that philosophy. \nAnother way to look at it is this: Most common car (US) V8 engines in the  70s produced as little as 110 HP. (Muscle cars made much more, but enlarged the engine and got terrible gas mileage) Today, we have 4 cylinder engines that produce 300 HP, and V8s that produce muscle car HP but get economy car fuel mileage. So, how does a 4 cylinder make more horsepower than a V8?  Its far more than the number of cylinders, just as its is far more than Ghz for CPUs.\n", "Q: Apple mdls (MetaData List) command on Networked Drive I have discovered mdls as a way of extracting information from a (photo) file. However, I have found that it doesn’t seem to work properly if I am accessing the file over the network. Some of the meta data is missing, most notably the GPS data which is what I wanted most.\nHowever, if I copy the file to a local drive, then the metadata is all there, and everything is fine again. This suggests that mdls is looking in the wrong place for some data … ?\nIt gets weirder depending on the network:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I connect using SMB I get a limited selection of metadata\n\n*If I connect using NFS I get the message that it could not find the file at all.\n\n\nHow can I use successfully mdls on networked files?\n\nA: Just an FYI, exiftool (which has to be installed) can pull all metadata from the file over the network without the need to have the network volume indexed.\nThat said, the most likely reason you're only getting some of the metadata is because indexing is most likely turned off on the network volume.\nI tested this with an SMB Share to a Linux System and copied over some photos that I know contain GPS Info.\nOn first query I got the same results you did, a subset of the metadata, however upon turning indexing on using mdutil and letting the volume be indexed, then mdls returned all metadata including the GPS Info.\nIn Terminal use the following syntax, mdutil -i on mount_point, e.g.:\nmdutil -i on /Volumes/Data\n\nAlso, you might want to read the manual page for: mdutil\n\nA: Not an answer but a data point. I also checked this under MacOS 10.2 but unlike user3439894 I'm on .3 instead of .2. When I tried mdutil -i on a network smb volume (both with sudo and without) I get the response: \"unexpected indexing state\". mdutil -s for the same networked volume yields: \"Server search enabled.\" In my case the difference may be that the networked share is on our MacOS 10.8 server.\nI encountered this answer while trying to figure out why tags put on a file in the Finder on the networked volume by a MacOS 10.12 machine do not appear when a different Mac running MacOS 10.10. I will have to see if a file tagged on the local Mac and then moved to the MacOS 10.8 server can have its tags read by the 10.10 Mac...\n", "Q: Is there a way to mount or expose a folder within a package to another folder? I'm trying to create a time-lapse video from jpegs using GoPro studio on the MAC but that (and alternatives I've tried) don't seem to understand how to access all the photos in the Photos app.\nIf I right-click on the Photos app and go to 'show package' contents, I can see all my photos in a directory called 'Masters'.\nIs there any way to mount or otherwise expose that folder as a standard folder that other applications might be able to work with?\n\nA: You can create an alias outside the bundle to expose this folder (by command-option dragging \"Masters\" out of the bundle). However, it is not always advisable to mess with the contents of a bundle, so proceed with caution. If you're just reading the photos, there's no problem, but Photos may not take kindly to modifications. The \"safest\" (but most annoying) way to access items in your Photos library is to export them from Photos itself.\n\nA: If the application you are using has a standard file selection dialog (the kind that Apple uses), you can drag and drop a folder or files from the Finder into that dialog.\nIn your case, this means you could open the package in the Finder and simply drag the “Masters” folder into the GoPro “Open” dialog.\n", "Q: Do the iPhone 7 and 7 plus cameras use the same sensor? I am looking to upgrade to the latest iPhone mainly for the camera.  I am wondering if the iPhone 7 and 7 plus use the same camera sensor.  Specifically, will they handle the same in low light conditions.  I shoot a lot of low light photos and am curious if they will perform the same.  \n\nA: SHORT ANSWER\nIf it was me and my main interest was in photography, I'd definitely opt for the iPhone 7 Plus over the iPhone 7. Don't get me wrong, both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have great camera systems, but the iPhone 7 Plus has a few features over the iPhone 7 because of its secondary 56mm-equivalent \"telephoto\" lens system. And, since you're main interest is in low light conditions, you should be aware that Apple markets the iPhone 7 Plus as being the one to use for low-light photography.\nLONG ANSWER\nLet's start with the specs - below is a summary of the camera specs of each:\niPhone 7 Plus\n\n\n*\n\n*PRIMARY CAMERA: Dual 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS and 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, quad-LED (dual tone) flash. This features: 1/3\" sensor size @ 28mm, 1/3.6\" sensor size @ 56mm, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 8MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection, and HDR (photo/panorama). Video recording at:   2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, and 720p@240fps.\n\n*SECONDARY CAMERA: 7 MP (32mm, f/2.2), face detection, HDR, and panorama. Video recording at: 1080p@30fps and 720p@240fps.\n\n\niPhone 7\n\n\n*\n\n*PRIMARY CAMERA: 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS), phase detection autofocus, and quad-LED (dual tone) flash. This features: 1/3\" sensor size, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 8MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection, and HDR (photo/panorama). Video recording at: 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, and 720p@240fps.\n\n*SECONDARY CAMERA: 7 MP (32mm, f/2.2), face detection, HDR, and panorama. Video recording at: 1080p@30fps and 720p@240fps.\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Apple pushes the fact that the iPhone 7 Plus is ideally suited to low-light conditions. They even produced a video to highlight this. It's called Midnight and you'll see that the iPhone being used is an iPhone 7 Plus (this is obvious when the user picks his iPhone up at about 5 seconds in).\nIn summary, with an iPhone 7 Plus you can use the 28mm-equivalent wide-angle lens using Photo mode, zoom up to 10x (digitally), and take snaps with an added depth of field effect using Portrait mode.\nIf you do a Google search I'm sure you'll find lots of info about the advantages of an iPhone 7 Plus camera system compared to the iPhone 7. I'm sure if you read some reviews you'll find some that tested each in low-light conditions for you to compare.\n", "Q: How can I get bluetooth devices to connect without repeatedly opening the Bluetooth preference pane? I have a bluetooth mouse (a Microsoft Designer Bluetooth) connected to my 2012 rMBP running Sierra.\nThe mouse works fine when it is connected.  For some reason, however, when it is disconnected in usual circumstances (sleep/wake, inactivity, etc), it usually doesn't reconnect, unless I open the Bluetooth preference pane.\nI don't have to do anything in the preference pane.  Merely opening it suffices to get the connection working, and the effect is almost instantaneous, sometimes happening before the preference pane visibly opens.\nThus my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does this happen?  What does opening the preference pane actually change?\n\n*How can I get the device to connect properly, rather than needing me to open the preference pane every time?\n\n\nI assume this is some sort of problem with power-saving configurations, but there are no user-discoverable options for this in macOS.\n\nA: I believe there has been many cases of Microsoft Designer Bluetooth mouse users having issues, so as a minimum this product appears to be very fussy. \nHowever, one thing I have seen that does work in some cases is to make sure it's the first Bluetooth device paired to your computer. \nIn a nutshell you need to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard and mouse.\nIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected.\nI have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).\nBefore starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nAlso, since you're trying to resolve an issue with a Bluetooth mouse,  you will need to use another mouse to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.    \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Shutdown your Mac\n\n*Ensure your Microsoft Designer Bluetooth mouse is fully powered off\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*On your Mac, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar \n\n*Select the Set Up Bluetooth Device option\n\n*On the mouse, press the power button down and keep it down for at least 5 secs. The blue light should start blinking\n\n*Once the Setup Assistant finds the mouse, select it from the list and click on “Continue”. \n\n*Now pair your mouse\n\n*If you have any other Bluetooth devices, you can go ahead and pair them now (or you can do it later). However, the point is to pair the Microsoft Designer Bluetooth mouse first before any other Bluetooth devices!\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: Restoring Contacts groups from Time Machine For reasons unknown, everything just completely vanished from my Contacts (including contacts and all of my groups).  Note, these are all Contacts that were stored on my Mac -- I don't use iCloud and they are not synced anywhere else.\nNo problem -- I have a Time Machine backup, so I enter TM, scroll back in time to yesterday, and there they are.  I select all and restore all of my contacts.  Back in the present, all of my individual contacts are there.  But none of the groups are.\nI've just spent several hours fruitlessly trying to figure out how to restore my groups.  One thing that has not worked is copying the entire Application Support > AddressBook folder from my Time Machine to my user library:  when I try this, and then restart Contacts, the entire list is empty again.  (I don't understand this behavior at all, by the way.)\n\nWhere does Contacts store my group metadata?  How can I restore it from a Time Machine backup?\n\n\nA: Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been dealing with trying to selectively restore certain data types from TM. Upon disabling the iCloud on a few devices, I lost contacts, calendar, reminders and notes. \nI worked with a senior Apple advisor to restore contacts and calendars from TM. (We were unable to get reminders and notes - argh.) I experienced what you have, some restore attempts did not bring back groups. I use groups heavily and so was very determined to find a solution that brought back both contacts and groups. \nWhen I saw your post yesterday, I contacted the Apple advisor to confirm the steps we took to restore contacts, that included groups. He says that it was going to ~Library/Application Support/Address Book, and restoring that entire folder was the solution. I can’t remember for sure (we were trying lots of different things), but he says that was the one that worked. I have to assume he is correct.\nIn your message, you indicate that this is the route you tried without success. Keep trying...I want to let you know there is a solution, I was able to do so. \nC.\n\nA: In Contacts, look at the View menu; you can hide groups, or show groups.\nThe data (at least, in El Capitan, 10.11.6) is in \n\"/Users/your_name_here/Library/Application Support/AddressBook\"\nWhen I delete a group, it changes the files\n\"Metadata\" and \"AddressBook-v22.abcddb-wal\"\n", "Q: Apple 5S Charge-Only USB Mode Is there any way to make the phone content inaccessible when connected via USB to PC. I want to do some settings on iphone itself so that the Internal storage isn't visible on laptop/PC to which it's connected.\nI want to use USB only for charging.\n\nA: Unfortunately no there is no way to set a default option of how your iPhone interacts with a computer. However if you plug in your iPhone it will ask you if you trust this computer and you click no, then that computer will not be able to see any data on the iPhone.\n\nA: You can use \"Data blocked\" and charge only adapter or USB cable.

I'm trying to create a one-click solution that'll open YouTube and start her playlist. At the moment, I can create a home screen schortcut from Safari which loads the playlist in Safari. There're several problems with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*For some reason it doesn't auto play the songs, even with the &autoplay=1 attached to the URL.\n\n*It doesn't load in the YouTube app. The webpage is not very grandma-friendly: she has shaky hands, her touch action to play the video tends to scroll the page instead. I've tried with youtube:// URL scheme, but it's impossible to add this URL to the home screen. Safari only allows me to do that after the page is fully loaded, and the URL textbox is not editable.\n\n*I live in a different country. It is best if I can change the playlist remotely upon request. I've tried creating a bitly short URL with the hope to be able to reconfigure it to a different playlist remotely. However, I haven't figured out how to add this bitly URL to the homescreen yet -- same reason as above.\nAny suggestions? I have a hunch that there's an app to do this!\n\nA: Okay never mind. I'm making a Github page to do this.\nPut the following code to a HTML page, which loads the YouTube app upon open:\n<script>\nwindow.location.href=\"youtube://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[videoId]\";\n</script>\n\nHost the page somewhere, for example github.io, and then add a shortcut on the homescreen.\n", "Q: Get List of Purchased Items on App Store Is there a way of downloading a list of all purchases from the Mac App Store?\nI know I can see them, and I know I can get a list of apps currently on my system, but I would like to have a list of all purchases ever made.\n\nA: Unfortunately the only way to do this is if you have access to a Mac (or Virtual Machine) running OS X El Capitan (10.11). I have an iMac that can't be upgraded beyond 10.11 so I'm able to do this pretty easily. I'll explain how for anyone who might be interested enough to do this in 2019 or beyond.\nThe App Store in El Capitan had a \"Debug\" menu, (which was removed in 10.12), which you can enable by entering this command in Terminal.app:\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\nOnce enabled, you will find the Debug menu at the far right of the App Store menus. One of its options is: \"Save page source to disk\"\n\nIf you open the \"Purchased\" tab in the App Store app, and then select \"Save page source to disk\" it will save the HTML to:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.appstore/Data/Library/Documentation/pageSource.html\n\n(I think it was /tmp/pageSource.html in an earlier version of OS X, but I'm not sure.)\nFrom there you can use the HTML file to produce a list, or just use the HTML file if you prefer. I have a script that transforms the pageSource.html into https://mas.luo.ma for me. \nI don't know how long Apple will support El Capitan accessing the App Store, but I believe they still support back to 10.7 / Lion, so I'm hopeful it will continue for a good long time.\n\nA: If you login to the app store and click the Purchased icon this will show all apps purchased with the ID you are signed in with. This will include currently installed as well as previously installed.\n\nDon't think you can download it though\n", "Q: how does the \"Time since last full charge\" update in iOS settings? I struggle to understand how this updates, anyone so polite to explain?\n\n\nA: From what I've noticed, the Time Since Last Full Charge only resets to 0 min when you charge your device completely. If you, for example, had been using your phone for a day, put it to charge in the evening, but without charing it to 100%, the timer will not reset. If you do the same thing the following day, it would display \"2 days\", even though you have charged your phone last night.\nAnd it also doesn't start counting the time until you unplug your phone from the charger.\n", "Q: How do I stop my iPhone messages from appearing on my Mac?

If I delete the messages app from my Mac, will it screw things up on my messages in general?\n\nA: No. Opting out of message delivery on one device (Mac or iPad) doesn't change delivery to the iPhone. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go ahead and disable handoff if you don't want that enabled. \n\n*go ahead and sign out of messages on the Mac if you don't want that enabled. \n\n", "Q: mysql on OSX suddenly stopped functioning, unable to locate or connect Having been using an installed version of mysql for some time without any problem, when I attempted to start the server recently it simply failed to recognise the command.\nThe installation is still there and I can see my databases in the filesystem.

If I press the unibody hard on the left side, then I can make the green disappear, but that's not a solution.  \nThis is a MacBook Pro (15”, mid-2010) 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 with 8GB 1067 MHz DDR3, an NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MB / Intel HD Graphics 288 Mb, and the OS is El Capitan v.10.11.6  \nTo determine if the problem is caused by a graphics card or not, I would like to know if there is a way to have only one card/processor active at time?\n\nA: If Cmd+Shift+3 does not capture the display as you see it, or, if mirroring the display on your external monitor does not reproduce it then it is not the OS which is making that happen.  \nYour problem may be in the connection of the graphics and screen hardware itself. If pressing the unibody relieves this, you may need to reseat the graphics card or some other component. Has you laptop been dropped recently?\nThis Mid-2010 MacBook Pro teardown article or this disassembly video might help you ascertain which components you are pressing on.\nAlso, you may simply be overheating from a clogged vent port.

Try moving to a darker area, or covering your light sensor to see if it then lets you turn it on.\n", "Q: Sky blue dot next to app I got an iPhone 7+ on iOS 10.2 and I just got this sky blue dot next to an app, instead of the normal blue one.\nAs you can see in the screenshot, there's a real difference between the sky blue and the normal one\nDo you guys know what that means?\nThanks\n\n\nA: I'm going by memory on this answer because I can't recall at this moment the Apple Support doc that covered this (I'll have to look it up later or someone can update my answer if they have the link).\nBoth colors indicate that an update was performed and you haven't opened the app since that update.\nThe dark blue dot means the app was updated manually.  This means you saw an update was available and you tapped the button to perform the update.  \nThe light blue dot means the app was updated automatically.  This means you have automatic updates turned on and the App Store checked, saw an available update, and updated the app without your initiating the update.\nI hope that makes sense and that it's not vica-versa. \n\nA: The dots are slightly transparent, so if they are in front of a dark wallpaper, they will appear darker.

I have a number of word files in both .doc and .docx format.\nDoes anyone know if there might be any problems opening these kind of files and, equally important, preserve the formatting and styles on a mac?\nI will be using Microsoft word on the mac.\n\nA: \nDoes anyone know if there might be any problems opening these kind of files?\n\nYou won't have any problems. With the pre-installed Pages app on Mac, you can easily open any .docx and .doc files. They will be converted to .pages documents that can't be opened on Windows PCs, but you can easily export any documents from Pages as .docx files that can be opened on PCs.\nAn easier solution is to use the web-based Google Drive (née Google Docs) that will let you natively open .docx, sync them to your Google account on all your computers, and edit them from anywhere, including your Mac. Or, if you'd prefer the Microsoft-based approach, you can download the Office suite onto your Mac, which works just how it does on PCs.\n\nCan I preserve the formatting and styles on a mac?\n\nI've had no problems preserving format and styling of a .docx document on Mac, using Pages or Google Drive. You will have no problems with a modern program like the ones I've suggested above.\n\ntl;dr: You can totally use Pages, Google Drive, or Word on your Mac to open, edit, and export documents without losing any formatting.\n\nA: Late and long, HTH:\nI've been using both Word 2016s, PC and MacOS, for 3 days now. There are compatibility issues breaking e.g. your TOC and StyleRefs and causing trouble in PDFs with at least one font of the Helvetica Neue LT Pro Family. It is quite easy to provoke Reference errors or an incomplete Table of Contents simply by opening a *.docx created in the other OS (see steps below). The third example is about the PDFs.\nError in StyleRefs: \n- Create a new blank document with Word 2016\n- Rename built-in styles from level 1 through 4\n- Create some dummy text and a few headers of all levels\n- Display the header of the current chapter in the document's footer via Field Function. You would now expect a field code like e.g. { STYLEREF \"myHeader_01\"..., but there is more: Word adds the name of the built-in style, e.g. (MacOS) { STYLEREF \"Heading 1;myHeader_01\"... or (PC) { STYLEREF \"Heading 1,myHeader_01\"... Did you already find the tiny difference? \n- Save your document, open it in the other OS. Prediction: The header text will not be shown in the footer. Instead, you get an error. The only difference is, that the Mac field codes work with \";\" while the PC field codes use \",\" as a separator.\n- Remedy: Delete the name of the built-in style and the separator from the field code, only keep your own name. Thus you will not need a separator. Your document will now survive any field update in any OS. \nIncomplete TOC: \n- Use the same test document and style set as above\n- Create another new level-1 header style\n- Create a custom TOC\n- Tap \"Options\" in the TOC assistant\n- Exclude one of the two 1st level headers from your TOC by erasing the numeric entry from the Input Field\n- Finish your TOC by means of the assistant\n- Toggle field codes (MacOS) { TOC \\o \"2-4\" \\t \"myHeader_01;1\" } and (PC) { TOC \\o \"2-4\" \\t \"myHeader_01,1\" } This will result in a TOC with 4 levels. The 1st level is created out of your style \"myHeader_01\" - thus the \"1\" behind the style name. Again you may remark the different separators in the (else identical) codes.\n- Save your document, open it in the other OS. At first you will see your TOC as expected. However, if you \"Update Fields\", 1st level entries will entirely disappear from your TOC.\n- Healing: If you can, delete the separator and the level number behind your style name. \"If you can\" = If you do not have to use separators for other purposes (e.g. exclusion of two or more header styles, exclusions in 2 and more levels). Without \",\" or \";\" in the TOC field codes, your document will survive any field update in any OS without content loss. \nMissing special characters in Mac PDFs\n- Install Font Family Helvetica Neue LT Pro in PC and Mac\n- Create a Word document with some dummy text. Type German special characters ä, ö, ü and others. Apply \"Helvetica Neue LT Pro 65 Medium\" (display in Mac Word's font dropdown box) / \"Helvetica Neue LT Pro 65 Md\" (display in PC Word) on all text.\n- Save document as PDF in both, PC and Mac version.\n- Compare PDFs: While the PC PDF displays ä, ö, ü as expected, the Mac PDF will display rectangles instead of these (and maybe other) letters. *.docx are ok in both OSs.\n- Workaround: Avoid this particular font or use it without ä, ö, ü, if you need to create PDFs from Word 2016's Mac version. \nConclusion: \nWord 2016 (MacOS) and Word 2016 (PC) do not create identical documents - even if you only use the typical functions (no VB etc.). The incompatibilities are worse than formatting issues; in my examples, they produced errors. You can never expect your documents to work without checking every page.\n\nA: In general the \"common stuff\" goes back and forth between platforms with no problems. Differing sets of fonts, various levels of support for showing colors, etc., between platforms can cause documents to appear differently on Windows vs macOS.\nWord has a compatibility checker than can help report on portions of documents that may not translate well to other versions of Word:\nhttps://support.office.com/en-US/article/Check-a-document-for-compatibility-C5AA52E0-15C8-4DA7-9942-379552795D90\nHere's a document from Microsoft's support knowledge base that covers the topic of sharing MS Office documents amongst various versions of Office:\nhttps://support.office.com/en-US/article/Sharing-documents-with-other-versions-of-Office-fdc95a18-f1fe-4049-b85c-42e2143f9243\nThis article is focused on Powerpoint, but offers good tips about compatibility that apply to Word as well:\nhttps://support.office.com/en-US/article/Cross-Platform-PowerPoint-Compatibility-0eebb4f1-c329-4c50-b83c-3af1bab640de\n\nA: Since you indicated that you will be using Word for Mac, as long as it's the 2016 or 2011 versions you will have no problems.\nMicrosoft has merged the code base (finally) so the versions for Mac and Windows are now identical, and the docs they produce are fully interoperable.\n", "Q: Shortcut for making a new window in Safari Whenever I use the new window shortcut in Safari, it creates a new tab instead of a new window.

There are a number of things I suggest you try to get to the bottom of this.\n1. Bootup into Safe Mode\nFirst of all let's boot up into Safe Mode. Not only can you test to see if the problem is replicated in Safe Mode, but the very act of booting into Safe Mode will run some checks, delete system cache files, verify your startup disk, and attempt to repair directory issues (if any are identified).\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. could you boot your Mac okay, is the issue still present, etc)\n\n*To exit Safe Mode just restart your Mac as normal\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went. This will help determine if the issue is related to third party software etc.\n2. Reset your PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this.\nYour question doesn't specify what model of Mac you're using, but all Macs (except for Late-2016 MacBook Pro models) use the same process. I've included steps for both scenarios below:\n\n\n*\n\n*For ALL models EXCEPT for Late-2016 MacBook Pros\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\n\n\n*\n\n*For all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\n3. Delete preferences\nIf starting in Safe Mode and resetting your PRAM/NVRAM does not resolve the issue, delete the com.apple.systempreferences.plist and com.apple.loginwindow.plist files.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*While only logged into your main account and within Finder, hold the option key while clicking on the Go menu\n\n*Select the Library option from the drop-down menu\n\n*In the Library window that opens up, find and open the Preferences folder\n\n*Right-click on com.apple.systempreferences.plist and select Move to Trash\n\n*Right-click on com.apple.loginwindow.plist and select Move to Trash\n\n*Restart the computer\n\n*Empty the trash\n\n\nTest to see whether this has made any difference to your problem.\n4. Create a new user account\nIf doing all three things above do not resolve the issue, I suggest creating a new user account. However, do not do this until you know the problem isn't resolved. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account\n\n*Reboot your Mac as normal\n\n*Log into the new account and use it for a little while (maybe some web browsing)\n\n*Now try using fast user switching to switch to another account\n\n*Take note of what happens (was the new user logged out or not?)\n\n*If the new user wasn't logged out, continue to step 7, otherwise stop here and report back\n\n*Use the account you're now logged into for a while\n\n*Now try fast user switching back to the new user account\n\n*Take note of what happens (was the old user logged out when you switched back to the new user account?)\n\n*Regardless of what happens at Step 9, now try using fast user switching to switch to another account\n\n*Take note of what happens (was the new user logged out or not?)\n\n\nAfter doing the above, report back on what happened at Step 6. If you progressed further, also report on what happened at Steps 9 and 11.\nIf you found the problem was not replicated in the above 11 steps, then use your computer normally (but do not delete the new user account you created). If the problem reappears, then start using the new user account instead for a while as your main account and see whether the problem returns.\n", "Q: What is the reason of sound from the attached file? From time to time I hear this sound without any visible notification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwUf1IftWc6YUk1BWDFoQ1A2SW8/view\nWhat is the reason of it?\nUsually I have the following apps opened: Chrome, Skype, Telegram, Sublime Text, IntelliJ, iTerm, Commander One, Postman.\nmacOS 10.12.3\n\nA: James P, Thanks for the hint!

What kind of adaptor would I need on the other end of the cable?\n\nA: Yes - you can look forward to vendors shipping Thunderbolt 3 docks and have one cable going to your Mac and everything else connected to the dock:\n\n\n*\n\n*power\n\n*ethernet\n\n*USB\n\n*video\n\n*Thunderbolt \n\n*possibly audio in/out and firewire\n\n\nI would read this review of Thunderbolt 2 docks and keep in mind that no Thunderbolt 2 dock will charge the new Thunderbolt 3 / USB C MacBook Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-thunderbolt-dock/\nUntil the \"3\" version docks ship, you'll need to use \"2\" version cables for display/dock/whatever and a second USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 charge cable.\n", "Q: How to avoid iTunes' \"Do you want the application iTunes.app to accept incoming network connections?\"? The last few releases of iTunes 12.5.x.y ask, every time iTunes is launched:\n\nDo you want the application \"iTunes.app\" to accept incoming network connections?\n\nIs there a way to select either answer as a default and avoid getting constantly asked that question?\n\nA: El Capitan\nUninstalling and reinstalling iTunes is the only way I could solve this issue.\nAs this (battery-draining, maldesigned) page warns you, you can't just drag iTunes to the Trash. El Capitan will warn you that it's part of the OS. Get Info, clicking on the padlock, and giving everyone read+write permission will get over that.\nThe next step is to download it. Surprise: iTunes is not available on the App Store. But you can download a dmg just fine here.\nAfter 5 minutes of use I can confirm the message no longer appears.\nI can also confirm that the music collection appears unharmed.\nPre El Capitan\nThanks to owlswipe's hint, the solution follows.\nIn System Preferences, under Security & Privacy\n\nClick \"Firewall Options\"\n\nand allow incoming connections for iTunes.\nIt's not clear why \"incoming connections\" is an option for iTunes.\n\nA: Deleting then installing iTunes seems like a bizarre way to resolve this issue, but it's also the only solution I've found that actually works.\n\nA: You can use this command line in terminal\nsudo codesign --force --sign - <full path to application>\nIt works for me\n", "Q: AppleScript: How to un-hide the file extension of a screenshot? set filePath to \"/Users/Me/Desktop/\" & \"Screenshot\" & \".png\"\n\ndo shell script \"screencapture -mx -T1 \" & filePath\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set extension hidden of (filePath as POSIX file) to false\nend tell\n\nThe above code produces the error:\n\nFinder got an error: Can’t set extension hidden of file \"Macintosh\n  HD:Users:Me:Desktop:Screenshot.png\" to false.\n\n\nA: You were close!

What is hiutil?\nWhy is it sucking up my cpu?\nHow long will this go for?\nWhen will it happen again?  \n\n\nA: It's indexing your computer drive(s).\nPer the man page hiutil (help index utility) is used for creating and examining .helpindex files (Help Viewer.app indices) & is used for the Help menu searches as well as for Spotlight. You can use sudo find / -name \"*.helpindex\" to display all of them. See here for some description from the developers site about Apple Help concepts.\nPer this answer on Apple's discussion forum hiutil is indexing your hard drive to make using the Help and Spotlight features snappier. You may also have a process running called mdutil (meta data utility).  \nYou can kill the process - it may run for a half hour depending on system changes (note the Activity Monitor syntax for time is d:h:5m:17.85s and it is reporting accumulated time with the processor actually used - not total time since the process first started). If you want it to not run at all, you could also remove the executable file from /usr/bin/ and restart - tho I'd suggest moving it somewhere so you can restore it to that location instead of deleting it.\nIf the process is running in conjunction with mdutil then you can check the status of the volume being scanned with mdutil -s <volumename>. You may want to open Activity Monitor as root so you can see everything going on (along with - as i see in your picture -selecting \"All Processes\" from the View menu):\nsudo \"/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app/Contents/MacOS/Activity Monitor\"\n\n...double click or select and Cmd+i on a process to get more info about it and related processes. \nWhen this process is running, you might - depending on your OS - see an index progression bar in your spotlight window if you start to enter text (or enter \"indexing\").\nYou can adjust your System Preferences >> Spotlight::Search Results and ::Privacy panes to alter the scanning behaviour. As changes are made to actively scanned directories, the indexer is invoked.\n\nIf your computer is continually indexing and won't stop, you could add your internal drive to the \"Private\" list and see if it the indexing finishes.\nAnother option if you determine that the hdutil process is working with mdutil is to enter sudo mdutil -E / . to force Spotlight to create a new index file.\n", "Q: touchbar and keyboard brightness adjustment Is there a way to manually control keyboard backlight with a MBP touchbar?\nThe same way the old F6 key was working on non touchbar laptop\n\nA: Yes, first expand the control strip by clicking on the arrow next to the 4 control buttons on the right (or 5 if you set it). Now there should be two icon similar to the one on the F5 and F6 key (unless you got rid of it in Keyboard Settings -> Customize Control Strip it should be there). \n", "Q: Is a sim-free iPhone different from a virtual-sim iPhone? We read that Apple has a patent on a 'virtual sim' iPhone. \nThen we saw that Apple was selling a 'sim-free' iPhone. \nBoth allow you to choose your carrier later. These appear to be different concepts. \nMy question is: Is a sim-free iphone different to a virtual-sim iphone?\n\nA: No no, Apple is selling the phone only, without a SIM or a carrier plan.  That's what SIM free means. The device ships without a SIM. You need to buy a SIM card separately . But a virtual SIM is a completely different thing.\nA virtual SIM is a concept in which no SIM card is needed and the protected storage is inside the phone. So you can switch carriers without changing a SIM\n", "Q: Safari asks for Flash to be enabled for every website? I have gotten along quite well without Flash for a long time.  But recently I had reason to install it for one particular website.  Since it is installed, I figured I'd have it prompt me if another site wants Flash.  But I've been asked to enable it for every website, almost all of which have worked fine without it and work fine after I say \"never for this website.\"\nI've tried FireFox on a few of those sites, with no apparent difference from before.\nShould I report it as a bug?  Can I put a stop to it, and if not, how do I remove Flash without breaking other things?\n\nA: Go to Safari Preferences, Security tab, and click Plug-In Settings. Select Flash Player on the left, and ensure that \"when visiting other websites\" is set to Off, rather than Ask.\n\n", "Q: Chrome doesn’t start on Mac OS I successfully installed Chrome on my Mac. However, when I'm trying to start it the browser icon just bounces in the dock once and disappears. Reinstalling, rebooting Mac and other options found on forums didn't help at all. How to fix this problem?\n\nA: After a lot of investigation, I've finally found the solution (so I decided to put it as an answer here).\nYou need to open Terminal (Spotlight search - type \"terminal\") and run the following command:\nsudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome\n\nIt will remove Chrome user data so use it at your own risk, but at least it helped me to run Chrome on macOS. Other approaches that seemed safer didn't work for me. You need to back up the Chrome folder beforehand if you're worried about losing your data.\n\nA: OK. I did not have the Chrome folder under ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google  So I just deleted the \"Google\" folder under \"Application Support\" and that fixed it!! deleted the Google folder - re-started Chrome and the Google folder and other folders under it got created \n\nA: Other thing is to run Chrome from the Terminal.\n$ cd '/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS'\n$ ./Google\\ Chrome &\n\n\nA: If the above command doesn't work, Open the Spotlight Search (cmd+space), Enter \"/Library/Application Support\" . Locate the Google folder, Move to Trash. And reinstall Chrome once again\n\nA: Better solution than removing the folder, since we don't know the impact, it to change folder permission.\nOpen Terminal and use command below:\nsudo chown -R $(scutil <<< \"show State:/Users/ConsoleUser\" | awk '/Name :/ && ! /loginwindow/ { print $3 }') ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google\n\nThis is basically same solution few other folks are mentioning above, but they are recommending the GUI way.\nPS: your password (administrator privilege) will be required.\n\nA: In my case the problem was solved by repairing folder permissions in the ~/Library folder as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Finder, navigate to ~/Library using the ⌘⇧G (Command+Shift+G) command\n\n*Open the folder info dialog\n\n*In the \"Sharing & Permissions\" section, unlock the lock by entering credentials\n\n*From the cogwheel drop down menu, select the \"Apply to enclosed items...\" action\n\n\nA: This is what worked for me: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7494016\nBasically you need to give the Google folder admin privleges in the Application Support folder. Like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a finder window or click on the Desktop.\n\n*Hold down SHIFT+COMMAND+G (⇧⌘G) type \"~/Library/Application Support\". Then click Go\n\n*Find the folder named \"Google\"\n\n*Get Info (⌘I)\n\n*In the Get Info window click on the lock in\nbottom right corner Enter your login password (you need to be an\nadmin) and press enter \n\n*Click the + button on bottom left\n\n*From the drop down click on Administrators Then click on select At the bottom of window you should now see admin Under \"Name\" To the right of amin click on \"read only\" and change to Read & Write\n\n*Now click on the setting cog and select Apply to enclosed like this\n\n\nA: In my case, the problem was that Google Chrome was in MacOS Login Startup Items. When I closed it, I couldn't restart it for some reason. I removed it from the Startup Items and now all's good.\n", "Q: How to examine disks and their partitions via terminal?

Please help me spot the error.\nI expect this to run with the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only while the user jaredclemence is using the system\n\n*Once immediately on login\n\n*Every 15 minutes thereafter\n\n*Change Directory to /Library/WebServer/Documents/medface/ before running the script.\n\n\nThe plist file is as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>org.pediatricheartcenter.medface.crons</string>\n        <key>User</key>\n        <string>jaredclemence</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n                <string>/User/jaredclemence/runMedfaceSchedTasks.batch</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n        <string>/Library/WebServer/Documents/medface</string>\n        <key>StartInterval</key>\n        <integer>900</integer>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have stored the file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.pediatricheartcenter.medface.crons.plist\n\n*A previous version of the file used Program instead of ProgramArguments with a <string> value instead of an array.\n\n\nA: Launchd writes errors to system.log.  Using Console, I viewed the log. There, launchd told me that it did not like my User key value.  I removed the User - jaredclemence key-value pair, and loaded the plist again. It then told me the batch program did not exist and I then noticed the error in the file path.  /User should be /Users\nBy removing the User setting and correcting the file path, I was able to fix the problem. Now, running ps -ef | grep 'runMed', I am able to see that the batch file is currently executing.\nSUCCESS!\n", "Q: SCRIPTS for TOUCH I've seen a useful command like this:\nfor f in *; do t=$(echo $f | sed -E 's/[-. mov]//g'); touch -t $t \"$f\"; done\n\nWhat do I need to change in that command, in order to keep only the \"time stamp\" string for a file with the following naming convention?\naaaa@XXXXXX(XXXXXXX)_20170201101315.mp3\n\n\nA: You can practice on the command line to get a working sed script:\n$ echo \"aaaa@XXXXXX(XXXXXXX)_20170201101315.mp3\" | sed -e \"s/^.*_//g\" -e \"s/\\.mp3$//g\"\n20170201101315\n\nSince the timestamp in your filename includes the seconds and it's not in a format that touch accepts (it wants a '.' before the seconds), I exclude them with a cut:\nfor f in *; do t=$(echo $f |  sed -e \"s/^.*_//g\" -e \"s/\\.mp3$//g\" | cut -c -12); echo touch -t $t \"$f\"; touch -t $t \"$f\"; done\n\n\nA: I'd take a little different approach, in that I'd want to test that the filename ends in .mp3 and the length of the t variable is 12 characters long before processing. This should keel it from acting on files that do not conform to the pattern and avoid throwing errors, even though the errors in this case should be non-fatal. I just don't like unnecessary junk outputted.\nThis is an example of it in script form:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in *.mp3; do\n    t=\"$(awk '/_.*/ { match($0, /_.*/); print substr($0, RSTART + 1, RLENGTH - 7); }'<<<\"$f\")\"\n        if [[ ${#t} -eq 12 ]]; then\n            touch -t \"$t\" \"$f\"\n        fi\ndone\n\nThis is an example of the script as a one-liner, albeit a long one.\nfor f in *.mp3; do t=\"$(awk '/_.*/ { match($0, /_.*/); print substr($0, RSTART + 1, RLENGTH - 7); }'<<<\"$f\")\"; if [[ ${#t} -eq 12 ]]; then touch -t \"$t\" \"$f\"; fi; done\n\nWhich can be shortened to:\nfor f in *.mp3; do t=\"$(awk '/_.*/ { match($0, /_.*/); print substr($0, RSTART + 1, RLENGTH - 7); }'<<<\"$f\")\"; [[ ${#t} -eq 12 ]] && touch -t \"$t\" \"$f\"; done\n\nIf you really want to shorten it further:\nfor f in *; do t=\"$(awk '/_.*/ { match($0, /_.*/); print substr($0, RSTART + 1, RLENGTH - 7); }'<<<\"$f\")\"; touch -t \"$t\" \"$f\" 2>/dev/null; done\n\nThe above form of the compound command does no error checking and redirects the error output of the touch command so it doesn't clutter the screen. This form is fine in this use case as a malformed touch commands will be non-fatal.\n", "Q: Show/emphasize only certain types of files in finder I use TeX a lot and it generates lots of auxiliary files that I am generally not interested in opening, and they clutter up my folders.  Is there any way to make Finder automatically hide/gray-out files with certain extensions in Compact List or Column views, either for a specific folder or for all folders?  \nAlternatively, if this is not possible, can I customize the \"view by file type\" option to separate into my own categories based on file extension (e.g., category 1 would contain .tex and .pdf files, category 2 would contain .sty and .bib, and so on) and have them listed alphabetized by category?\n\nA: One option would entail examining latexmk and rubber with their cleanup options.\nBut since cleaning up the .aux and related files is only recommended after the final compilation run anyway, the following seems to present a very neat solution for macOS users. One way to cleanup afterwards when you use TeXShop with its default settings is adding this flexible AppleScript to the program:\n[quote]\nA TeXShop solution\nAs others have mentioned, deleting auxiliary files as a matter of course is not usually a good idea, especially for complex documents.

A friend tells me that on OSX, bypassing password and getting into user's files is very easy (especially when hard disk not encrypted, but protected with user's login password). He tells me this is how it would be done:  \n\n\n*\n\n*shut down the mac  \n\n*hold Cmd+s  \n\n*boot up the mac\nthat is all you need for basic root access  \n\n*mount -w /\nto get basic read/write  \n\n\nI can't believe it would be that easy. Is he talkin cr*p or what?\n\nA: I just did it on my MacBook Air with macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (latest macOS as of 02/2017) and that is indeed actually how it can be done.  \nAs Tetsujin wisely points out, if you have the machine in your hands, then no OS is immune to a simple 'read the disk' attack - unless the drive itself is encrypted.\nOf note Cmd+s invokes \"Single User Mode\" and there are other ways to bypass the login requirement, such as booting into local or internet \"Recovery Mode\" or booting the drive in \"Target Mode\". To avoid abuse of these options, you could also use a Firmware Lock. Per the article about \"Recovery Mode\":\n\nEnable a Firmware Password to Lock Down Your Mac’s Hardware Even with\n  FileVault enabled, someone with access to your Mac could still wipe it\n  from recovery mode and set it up as a new system. A firmware password\n  can protect against this.\nThis will also help if you don’t want to use FileVault encryption for\n  some reason, but do want to prevent people from changing your password\n  and accessing your files. A firmware password also prevents people\n  from booting your Mac from other devices — like USB drives or external\n  hard drives — and accessing your files if they’re not encrypted.\n  Someone could still rip the hard drive out of your Mac and access its\n  files on another device if you just use a firmware password without\n  encryption, however.\nIf you set a firmware password, you’ll need to enter it before booting\n  into recovery mode or holding the Option key to boot from a different\n  device. Just powering on your Mac normally without doing anything\n  special won’t require the password, so it isn’t too much additional\n  hassle.\n\nAlso of note, per this answer, the impact to performance from activating FileVault on computers using SSD drives is negligible. The only difference the user will likely notice is the need to enter a password prior to booting... and remembering where you stored your \"recovery key\" should you ever need it.\n\n\nA: Enryption is opt-out so anyone that doesn't have their boot drive encrypted chose to do so out of a decision or inattention/ignorance.\nPhysical control of the computer gives you total control of the contents of the storage. Before Yosemite, you had to opt in to encrypt your data, so I suppose this is possible / default based on the version of macOS you run up against.\nYou could also enable a firmware password to prevent booting to single user mode or target disk mode if you wanted a little more protection but had to opt out of encryption of the drive.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a custom keyboard and upload it to the App store? I am working with someone who teaches an endangered language, of interest to a fairly small group. Many of the people in that group use only phones, and don’t have laptops.

You should make sure there is not one there already by searching the store for the language you are talking about.\nHave a look at the Keyman app.  It already has lots of keyboards and I think offers ways to create new ones. \nKeyman \nFor developer info see iOS Custom Keyboard\n", "Q: Choppy mouse on macOS Sierra 10.12.3?

So I decided to recover OS X (El Capitan), have it installed to an external drive and then use Bootcamp to do a full install of Windows to the main drive. But now he doesn't allow me to use the full drive, he always wants to keep a share of about 10 GB for an \"OS X\" that does not exist.\nIs there a way to tell Bootcamp to use the whole disk? Otherwise, when I download macOS Sierra and create an install medium from it, will I be able to fetch the Bootcamp installer from this medium?\n\nA: No. Install OSX, then use Bootcamp Assistant to make and format a new partition and install Windows.

Otherwise an adversary could easily determine which sections were blank, and attack only the ones that weren’t all 0s.\nThat’s one weakness of per-file encryption: allowing an attacker to determine what they want to target.\nThe way you chose to perform this operation, your empty disk will be fully encrypted once. Then once you move the 1 TB back onto it, encryption will be performed a second time on half of your drive.\nThis means it will have taken 50% longer to encrypt the drive vs. if you had left the files on the drive to begin with. Then add to that the amount of time required to shuffle the data back and forth, and you end up with a significant time loss.\nNow since the process has already started, it’s more advantageous to let it complete before moving the files back over. Spinning hard drives really struggle with writing multiple areas of a drive at a time (which would occur if you encrypt one area while copying files to another).\nIf the external is an SSD, copying while the initial encryption takes place might not impact the process as much.\n", "Q: Access radeon setting on mac, 3d defective I am new at mac recently. The mid 2010 imac shows shattered lines and dots in any 3d apps. Chess is the example:\n\nI tried the hardware test by hold 'd' but couldn't find problem. I tried format and install OS. This imac still has the problem.\nI will try to downclock/underclock. How about adjust 3d setting so does mac have radeon's setting (catalyst)?\n\nA: MacOS does not have Radeon Settings/Catalyst as Windows does. Apple publishes their own drivers through system updates. While Nvidia does offer their own Mac drivers, they often lag far behind the PC counterparts and don't seem to offer any sort of Wattman-equivalent for changing clock speeds.\nWhile there is an app called ATICellerator, it hasn't been updated in almost a decade, and almost certainly won't work with a more modern card, like the one in your iMac.\nConceivably, you could create a custom ROM and reflash your card using Zeus–however, both Zeus and the guides/support for such a modification are relatively limited, especially for a niche card like yours–generally this was used to flash desktop PC cards with Mac firmwares. This is a potentially risky process that may leave you with bricked/dead hardware if you mess up–though you may decide you've got nothing left to lose.\nThe simplest and best solution is probably to just buy a replacement GPU and replace it following a guide such as the one iFixit publishes. If your card is dying, underclocking it may not save it much longer anyways. If you want to test this, consider installing Windows and attempting to apply a clock change using some sort of reputable app such as Wattman (bundled with the AMD drivers) or MSI Afterburner. You may find that even then, clock changes refuse to stick (even within Windows) for one reason or another. Note that these changes will not pervade through to MacOS.\n", "Q: How to rework a \"System Events\" command in AppleScript, so that it automatically works in all applications? With the following AppleScript code within a \"Run AppleScript\" action in a Service:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theSBounds to {{572, 64}, {332, 515}}\n    set position of window \"Google Hangouts - myemailaddress@gmail.com\" of application process \"Google Chrome\" to item 1 of theSBounds\n    set size of window \"Google Hangouts - myemailaddress@gmail.com\" of application process \"Google Chrome\" to item 2 of theSBounds\nend tell\n\nthe Service will only work if the application from which that Service has been called has been added to the list of applications under \"Allow the apps below to control your computer.\" This list is found at System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility.\nIs it possible to modify the AppleScript code somehow so that adding every application on one's computer to the list is not necessary? Or, so that, one only needs to add one item to the list, as opposed to every application on one's computer?\nI thought that something like this might work:\ndo shell script \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\"' -e 'set theSBounds to {{572, 64}, {332, 515}}' -e 'set position of window \\\"Google Hangouts - myemailaddress@gmail.com\\\" of application process \\\"Google Chrome\\\" to item 1 of theSBounds' -e 'set size of window \\\"Google Hangouts - myemailaddress@gmail.com\\\" of application process \\\"Google Chrome\\\" to item 2 of theSBounds' -e 'end tell'\" with administrator privileges\n\nbut this code also requires that the application from which the Service is run is added to the Accessibility list.\nNote: I only want to run this AppleScript as a Service, and not in an Automator-created Application, because the code receives selected text as its input (system-wide).\n\nA: I've found an okay solution (i.e., workaround).\nInsert the \"System Events\" block of code into a \"Run AppleScript\" action and save it as its own application file in Automator. Note: The file extension of this code must be .app in order for this to work (more on this in a moment).\nGo to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy tab → Accessibility. Add and checkmark the newly created application to the list of apps allowed to control your computer.\nRun the newly created app from within your Service. To do so, you may add the following line to your AppleScript code:\ndo shell script \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Application Name\\\" to activate'\"\n\n(I habitually use osascript to activate applications when using a \"Run AppleScript\" action in a Service, as this circumvents a bug with Services that I've discovered.)\nYour Service should now run perfectly in every application on your computer, despite the fact that only one application (the one that contains the \"System Events\" code) has explicitly been granted the power to control the computer.\nThe file must be saved as a .app file, and not as a .scpt or .applescript file. This is because it is not possible to add .scpt or .applescript files to the list of apps allowed to control your computer; only true .app files can be selected in the dialog.\nNote that the .app file does not have to be created in Automator. If you create the .app file in Script Editor.app and follow the other steps, the .app file will function in the same manner.\nThere is one difference, however. When the .app file is created in Automator, one can use either activate or launch to run the application in their Service. But, when the .app file is created in Script Editor, one can only use activate to run the application; launch will result in nothing happening.\n", "Q: How to stop auto music playing on Bluetooth connect My mom got an iPhone 6s, and she LOVES it. There is one problem. When she connects to her car Bluetooth (the car is a 2012 Toyota Sienna LE), it automatically plays music, even without opening the music app. She tried Siri, opening and closing the music app, and turning off Bluetooth entirely. None of these work. So, is there a setting or a trick to stop music from playing automatically after she connects to Bluetooth?\n\nA: I created a song called \"AAA Silence\" that fixes this problem at least for iPhones (by being 79 minutes of silence that should always be the first song alphabetically on your phone), and I put it on the iTunes Store and on CD Baby. You can just search for \"AAA Silence\" in the iTunes Store or on CD Baby to get it. Alternately, you can get direct links to buy it and read more about it at http://aaasilence.com/\n\nA: Turning the bluetooth connector off, then it stops. \nBut if you want the BT connection on, you can try another source on your car media system: select Radio or SD card or DvD or another medium will play that instead of the iPhone music. And it will remember that setting probably (in my car it does).\nNormally the iPhone music is played by direct connect via BT to the music library without he music app.\n", "Q: Making an El Capitan Install/Recovery Flash Drive from Snow Leopard To make a long story short, I managed to have to wipe my entire hard drive. Fortunately, I have a Time Machine backup ready to work. Unfortunately, I can't find any way to get the option of restoring it.\nI have the Snow Leopard DVD somewhere in the house, but after somebody moved it, I've completely lost track of where it is. I've ransacked the house and found every other disc I've ever owned but that one. If I could use it, I would have by now, and I wouldn't be here asking this question.\nI do have some resources. I have a copy of the \"Install El Capitan\" program with its .dmgs sitting on the other computer's hard drive. The trouble is that that computer has Snow Leopard, and that's the last version of OS X that it can run. That's a problem, because Snow Leopard doesn't have access to createinstallmedia, which I understand is the go-to solution for this kind of thing.\nI followed the instructions in this question, and it got me as far as making a bootable USB flash drive that has El Capitan on it. The trouble is that it can't install it (it gives me some \"undefined error 0\" or somesuch), and for some reason, the menu that usually allows you to access Time Machine recovery is nowhere that I can see, even though the installer suggests that it should be available.\nI got cute and tried to access it through the Terminal, but apparently recovery/installer-partition Terminal is crippleware, as it doesn't come with the \"open\" command.\nI've spent most of my waking hours since 4 AM this morning stressing about this, and it'd be nice if there was a relatively easy, viable solution that I'm missing. If not, I do think I know how I can fix it (create another boot drive based on the Snow Leopard Mac with Carbon Copy Cloner, then copy the installer onto it and run it from the flash drive), but it'll take hours and I'd like there to be a quicker way.\nThanks for any help y'all can provide.\n\nA: Your main disk is correctly formatted.\nThere is no OS on the main disk.\nYou have a TM disk with backups on it.\nAnd you have a bootable stick with ElCapitan on it, made on another Mac.\nConnect the USB stick only, start the mac while holding the Alt/Option key: this gets you in the boot menu, the only thing in there is the USB stick, select and start from it. Then follows the installation of ElCapitan.1)\nRestart the mac again, it starts in ElCapitan, connect the TM disk, (re)connect the TM disk to TimeMachine, after that you can enter TM.\n1). If the USB stick does not start, you have to make a new bootable USB stick again.\n", "Q: iTunes \"smart\" playlists - unable to limit filter to any other existing playlists Someone has already asked this question about a month ago, and he did a fine job of explaining it and it is EXACTLY what is happening to me.

I can see the mouse pointer within the VM. But clicking on menus has no effect, dragging on window titles has no effect, clicking within the various apps’ windows has no effect. \nAt that point, the VM becomes useless. My only option is to choose Actions > Restart on the Parallels app (on the real Mac) to reboot the VM.

I can still move the mouse cursor around, though.\n\n\nA: A workaround with this is to open Apple Remote Desktop, and screen share the Mac VM. At least doing that will keep me from losing work that I have started in the VM.\nI have contacted Parallels support about this many times. It happens on both of my Macs, and it has been going on since I upgraded to Parallels 12 last year. It's still happening with Parallels 13.

While other software demands it to be there?\n\nA: You are doing two different things here.\nThe text one is open a file with the application that open associates with the file extension.\nThe Terminal one is you trying to open a named application. \nWhat open does is first look, using the full path name, for the file that is named, as you only give a file name it is a relative path it looks for that file in the current directory. (Thus for Terminal.,app it says it can't find the file and then gives up). When it has found the file it then searches for the default application for the file's extension, then sees if the application is running, if not it starts the application. Finally open sends a message to the application to deal with the file. \nPassing -a to open tells open to use the named application, it searches its database for previously opened apps and so does not need the full path to find Terminal.app\n", "Q: What GPU can i put in my Mac Pro 5,1?

I'm after something similar to the Skype app. I've tried Zoiper and Bria but neither have this feature. \nThe app should support the standard SIP protocol and allow connecting to any VoIP/SIP provider.\n\nA: I know that there is an app that behaves similar to your mention. The case is, that the app I'm talking about is well known in DACH and is only working with routers of a specific company 'avm'. The app is called 'Fritz!App Fon' and empowers you to receive and make calls. Even when not opened, the app receives incoming calls. Unfortunately you need those routers 'Fritz!Box' to take advantage of that feature. VOIP providers can then be set in the router's settings and be bound to your device - very simple and not complicated at all.\nEdit: Via VPN you are able to make those calls from any place on the world - internet connectivity required :)\n\nA: I tried several SIP client apps (in beginning of 2019, with iOS 12.1.3 on iPhone SE, with my SIP provider; your mileage may vary).\nOnly free apps (with the exception of payable push notification service, where noted).\nFirst a note: one of the biggest issues is availability while the app is in the background, or when you just put the phone down and it locks the screen and kills most apps. So the app can not receive incoming calls (or messages). This is solved by the app making/tricking the OS to run the app in the background all the time, or using push notifications (the \"official\" way, supported and endorsed by iOS).\nSecond note: All apps can and do use the phones contact list. To match incoming calls, allow selecting a contact to make an outgoing call, etc...\n\"Winners\"\nBria Mobile (version 5.5.2)\nI enabled push notifications, costs about 1 EUR per month, there is a week or two free trial period.\nI did not test background mode (instead of push notifications) although the app has some settings for that (and they all warn about increased battery usage).\n\n*\n\n*(++) works, with almost zero issues (unlike others)\n\n*(--) push notifications are payable (they are payable for all apps, to be honest, at least the ones listed here)\n\n*(--) the missed call notification sometimes shows only phone number and no contact name (even if caller is known and in my contact list)\n\n*(--) in received SMS messages it converts some character combinations to smiley icons\n\nGrandstream Wave (version 1.2.9.3)\n\n*\n\n*(++) works also in background\n\n*(--) therefore increases battery usage\n\n*(--) still sometimes not receiving incoming calls, rarely (I guesstimate around one in 20 incoming calls to fail)\n\n*(--) many incoming SMS messages are unreadable due to a graphics glitch\n\n*(--) incoming calls phone number often not matched to a known contact (see details here)\n\n*(--) sometimes receives the same SMS multiple times\n\n*(--) after restart of phone, incoming calls don't work even if app is still running (is shown in the active app list), have to start it manually\n\n*(--) back (arrow) button in the GUI is very unresponsive, have to tap it several times to work\n\n\"Losers\"\nLinphone 4.0.3 (inside the app it says 4.0.2)\n\n*\n\n*(--) not showing received SMS message content, only time and sender\n\n*(--) outgoing calls don't work!\n\n*(--) sometimes changes in settings/preferences are not remembered\n\n*(--) does not match incoming call phone numbers to contacts\n\nZoiper Lite v3.21.1\n\n*\n\n*(--) bad support, both free/community and premium.

From both of these OSX devices Im able to print wireless and everything works fine for these. However I also have iOS device and from what I understand I can print only using AirPrint in case of iOS. In this guide they say AirPrint printers connected to the USB port of the Apple AirPort Base Station or Time Capsules are not supported with AirPrint.\nSo it means I should disconnect usb printer from the AirPort and connect to wireless network directly, but in that case I would be unable to print from my OSX devices? (I assume this AirPrint functionality is not available in OSX, but Im not sure)  Does this technically mean that you can use Airport Extreme to connect with printer centrally shared for the network but cannot use it for iOS and OSX devices at the same time??\n\nA: Connect your printer to your network instead of the USB port. Your Mac can print wirelessly if in the printers network both via the AirPrint driver as well as the printers native driver (might need to be downloaded from the manufacturers site). The native driver might give you more options (if you have more than 1 paper tray or other non-default features). \nYour iOS device will print via AirPrint or alternatively there might be an app from the manufacturer that allows printing via the app but not on a system level. \n\nA: You can use AirPrint printers on macOS. To do this you must plug it in via USB to the wifi router, then on your mac, use System Preferences to add the printer by clicking the little + button. Use the network tool that should find it via Bonjour (a feature built into most devices). This should work for both Mac and PC, as well as iOS. \nSource(s):\nhttp://www.msl.ubc.ca/it-support/printing/install-printer-osx \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201387\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201311\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT203159\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2929464/how-to-share-a-printer-using-an-airport-extreme-or-airport-time-capsule.amp.html\n", "Q: How to prevent reopening of all programs after power outage When shutting down or logging out regularly, there is an option to reopen, or not, all the programs and their respective windows upon logging in again.\nThat option for me is unchecked, and the OS seems to remember that choice.\nLikewise, in the General panel of System Preferences, I have it set to NOT reopen windows/documents when relaunching programs.\nHowever, if the new login occurs after a power outage, every single program that was previous opened gets opened up and attempts to load the windows that were open, rendering my computer basically unusable for almost ten minutes or more (I often have dozens of programs open and we won't even talk about number of tabs on Chrome).\nIs there a way to suppress the relaunching of programs and previously opened documents permanently and definitively?\nI'm on Sierra.\n\nA: For others looking for an answer to this, specifically to prevent applications restarting after a power failure, see this other AskDifferent post:\nAvoiding all apps reopening when OS X crashes\nThe important part is to prevent the OS from writing to the ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow* file(s) which are used to record which applications are open at any given time, and informs the OS of which applications to restore in the case of a power failure.\nIf you need to ensure that your system's start-up sequence is the same regardless of a manual or timed power-on, as well as a restart in the case of a power failure, then the details provided at the linked answer above, are the solution you need. This is particularly useful in cases where the system is being used to power a kiosk or a similar setup.\nI recommend following the \"GUI method\" outlined in the linked answer, which first involves emptying the file of any references to currently open applications, then locking the file, using the Get Info window's Lock option. This prevents the file being written to going forwards, and ensures the file remains empty of references to currently running applications. As such the system will restart from a power failure, in the same way as it would under normal start-up conditions.\n\nA: Have a look at Temporarily Disable Login Items in Mac OS X.\n\nHow to Temporarily Disable Login Items in OS X\nTo temporarily disable all login items and login apps from loading\n  upon start or login of OS X, hold down the Shift key when clicking the\n  “login” button and continue holding the Shift until the desktop\n  displays on the Mac.

A power supply with a rating of 45W will supply up to 45W.1 \nA general rule of thumb is that you can always get a bigger power supply, never smaller.

Can you run 2 at a time (24A) on the same circuit?  Nope, it will pop.  Can you run 1 vacuum and a 1A lightbulb (13A)?  Sure.\nSo, you can plug a device with a 60W draw into an 80W power supply, but it's not recommended to plug the same device with a 60W draw into a 45W power supply.\nWhat can happen?\nWith the new USB-C ports on the Mac, most likely a slow charge.  With devices in general - you could damage/destroy the device and/or the power supply.\n\n1 This assumes the same voltage.  USB-C will auto negotiate the power delivery.  Older devices that don't do this; too many volts can fry your device.  More amps than necessary won't harm anything.

She has not changed any settings - I believe.\nShe cannot login because Caps Lock is always on causing $%£%£^ characters and backspace key does not work.\nLooking online, it seems I need to reset PRAM.\nPressing PROptionCommand   always loads Recovery utility. I have tried many times, and all variations in timings before and after pressing power.\nBased on Adriano's comment I need another way to reset PRAM, as I cannot log in to turn off Password Firmware Protection.\nAny Suggestions\nThanks Colin K\n\nA: After reading your question a few times I've made an assumption (dangerous, I know). My assumption is that the only password you're being prompted for is your daughter's User Account password and NOT a firmware password. The reason I assume this is because the only reason (it seems) that you think it's prompting for a firmware password is because of Adriano's answer to another question.\nSo, if my assumption is correct, then my first thought was the same as that offered by n1000 in the comments - Have you tried an external keyboard?\nHowever, if you haven't got an external keyboard handy, and since you're booting into Recovery Mode anyway, you can actually change your daughter's password from Recovery Mode and then log in using that and change the settings so a password is no longer required. \nWhy would this help? Well, since your Caps Lock key is stuck, creating a password with how your keyboard is right now will mean that you will be able to log in using that keyboard.\nResetting password from Recovery Mode\nTo reset your daughter's password password from Recovery Mode, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off your Mac\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode by pressing the power button while holding down CommandR\n\n*Select Disk Utility and press Continue.\n\n*Choose Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*Enter resetpassword (all one word, lowercase letters)\n\n*Press Return\n\n*Select the drive with your daughter's account (typically the main hard drive)\n\n*Choose your daughter's account using Select the User Account.\n\n*Enter a new password \n\n*Re-enter the same password\n\n*Enter a password hint\n\n*Click Save \n\n*Ignore the warning about the password changing\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Shutdown the Mac using Apple > Shut Down\n\n*Restart the Mac normally and use the new password to log into your daughter's account\n\n*Once logged in, go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on Users & Groups\n\n*Click on Login Options\n\n*From the Automatic login pop-up menu, choose your daughter's account\n\n\nThis will ensure that whenever your daughter's Mac is booted it will automatically boot into her account (which it sounds like you want to do).\nIf I've misunderstood your question, or you have any questions/issues, let me know by posting a comment.\n[Edit]\nNow that we've got you logged in, let's try sorting out your keyboard issue. Since you can't reset the PRAM as per usual, it's actually worth resetting the SMC instead. Sometimes this will resolve the issue preventing a PRAM reset.\nFor your MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer \n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in. \n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol \n(on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button \n\n*Let go \n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button. \n\n\nOnce you've done this, log back in and see if there's been any change to your keyboard and report back.\n\nA: As you have already found, you can't reset the NVRAM1 because your Caps key is in the \"locked\" state.

Even with the Screenshots that one can grab with Cmd+Shift+3.\nPhotoshop and Affinity Photo display colors properly (and rather consistently) on all the above scenarios.\nI discovered that it won't happen when the original display profile (named imac) is used, but will happen with all the other profiles, created both by basICColor and ArgyllCMS.\nHere's a sample: \n\nFrom left to right, the rendering of the same file in Preview(quick look is the same), Apple Photos App, Photoshop and Affinity Photo\nAnobody having a clue what is going on? It's been bothering me for months! \nEdit (an interesting discovery): I discovered that unchecking \"embed color profile\" while viewing the Export As.. dialog on Photoshop, exhibits a similar darkening issue that is fixed if I revert my System Preferences to using the default display profile. The file saved is fine though. Probably Adobe is using macOS's previewing capabilities inside their Export As... dialog? I wouldn't know....\nApple Photos app is exhibiting a similar behavior, but the results is not so exaggerated as it is in the preview/quick look tool\nHere (on the left) is how QuickLook shows an image when I first open it, and then (on the right) when I double tap (with my magic mouse) to cause it to zoom. When the image is already 1:1 scale like this one, it won't zoom further, but the color weirdness does kick in anyways. Zooming out, doesn't solve the problem. One has to close QuickLook to recover original colors.\n\n\nA: (After reading all the literature I could find around the issue here's what I've learned)\nA disclaimer first\nThere is a chance (as @Mr.Kennedy points out) that your system is suffering from issues with the quicklook generator.

Most probably an Apple's bug inside ColorSync or Preview/QuickLook/Photos, that affects some color profiles generated by a few profiling software, but does not affect other profiles at all (such as the factory profiles).\nAccording to some, first ColorSync issues were introduced in Mountain Lion. Others had issues in Mavericks, while others discovered it first in El Capitan. I can verify that it is still present in Sierra though. It's unclear if all these issues were all one and the same, but in here I'll treat them as such.\nAdobe is aware of these issues (it was affecting Lightroom up to some version) rectified it since(2), but consequent updates by apple have complicated things since it has reemerged in a different way. There is a lengthy discussion in the Adobe forums(3).\nCause\nAt the root, it is that certain ICC profiles, contain information that **Apple's ColorSync won't treat properly (and this affects all programs that rely on ColorSync).\nThere have been various ideas proposed as what it is that ColorSync doesn't like about them.\nThis issue has been linked (but inconclusively) to:\n\n\n*\n\n*LUT based icc profiles\n\n*matrix based icc profiles\n\n*particular software used to generated the ICC profile (eg displayCal/basICColors).\n\n*compatibility issues with the ICC version number (ICCv2 or v4 profiles)\n\n*black point compensation accounted for in the profile curves.\n\n*EIZO displays\n\n*Secondary displays\n\n\nThere has been no consensus though. For instance I've seen both ICCv2 and ICCv4 profiles that work, and ICCv2 and ICCv4 profiles that do not.\nSolution\nNo solution has been found yet afaik.\n\n\n*\n\n*From reports, it seems that profiles created with certain programs seem to be \"incompatible\" while profiles created by other programs seem to be fine.If you are using \n\n\n*\n\n*displayCal (using ArgyllCMS) (aka dispcalGUI)\n\n*basICColor \n\n*Eizo ColorNavigator (4)\nthis may be the related. testing some other software for profiling, may be the solution for some who have the option\n\n*Others have reported success with experimenting by changing parameters of the profiles generated (ICC version number, black point compensation, LUT, curves, 3x3 matrix) but nothing definitive.\n\n*Adobe is implementing its own workarounds(2),(5) (that seem to be falling apart when apple is changing something).\n\n*One could revert to using the factory profile (for those who don't care about color management) which work fine\n\n*Needless to say that avoiding ColorSync reliance and using programs that color manage their own output everywhere in your work environment is certainly the most complete solution (but rarely a viable option)\n\n\nRaising Awareness\nYou may also wish to add your voice by submitting to Apple a bug report on the issue\nOther places where this problem is discussed\nI'm listing here some of the other places where these issues are being discussed\nOSX Preview issues\n\n\n*\n\n*Q: Preview+El Capitan = color management bug?\n\n*Q: wrong colors in preview.app\n\n*Dark Images in Mac \"Photos\" & \"Preview\" with DisplayCAL generated Profile\nAdobe Lightroom\n\n\n*\n\n*Lightroom 5 ICC profiles clipped shadows under OSX\n\n*Serious color management bug in Mac OS 10.9 \"Mavericks\"\n\n*Further quantification of the Mavericks color management problem\nFinalcut Pro X\n\n\n*\n\n*Q: Very very dark video in FCP X viewer.\n\nA: I had this problem with High Sierra, Preview, and a DisplayCal profile. \nThe latest version of DisplayCal, 3.5, has in its release notes:\n\nMac OS X: Set default profile type to single curve + matrix with black point compensation due to long-standing Mac OS X bugs with any other profile type.\n\nUpgrading DisplayCal and creating new profiles for each of my displays based on the Default profile solved the problem for me.

The install disk says OSX 10.4 but I don't know if it's been upgraded.)\nI can't insert the install disk into the optical drive (it encounters a solid resistance - I can't tell if there's another disk in there or not, but pressing Eject does nothing, and I don't see any hole in which to poke a paperclip to try to manually eject it). \nI found a recommendation to:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into single-user mode \n\n*run fsck -fy \n\n*mount -uw / \n\n*rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone \n\n*reboot\nwhich supposedly would take me through creating a new (admin) user account, which I could then use to reset the owner's password. It rebooted, asked me what language I wanted to use, and after that, nothing (it briefly showed the spinning gear, changed the screen color a couple of times, showed the spinning gear, changed screen color, ad infinitum).\nI did manage, from single user mode, to use Unix commands to verify that the owner's home directory still existed. I also inserted a flash drive into a USB port hoping I might use Unix 'cp' to copy the home directory onto it, but it didn't appear in the /Volumes directory.\nNow the machine boots up to the window asking what language to use, and goes no further. And as I mentioned, the optical drive doesn't appear to work.\nBefore I go out and buy a FW 400-800 cable and a FW800-Thunderbolt adapter to try and mount the PB in firewire mode to my 2012 MBP, I wondered if someone could suggest any other things to try. \nUPDATE in response to Gordon Davisson: \nOutput of sw_vers\n\n\n*\n\n*ProductName: Mac OS X \n\n*ProductVersion: 10.4.11 \n\n*BuildVersion: 8S165\n\n\nOutput of ls /dev/disk*\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/disk0  /dev/disk0s1  /dev/disk0s3\n\n\nOutput of ls /dev/disk* after plugging in flash drive\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/disk0  /dev/disk0s1  /dev/disk0s3  (same)\nOutput of diskutil list\n\n\n*\n\n*Command never completed!

This is what is preventing my inserting a CD. \n[UPDATE]: All suggestions were useful but were stymied by other unforeseen problems (optical drive problem, etc.). I finally paid about $35 for a Firewire 400-800 cable and a Firewire->Thunderbolt adaptor, booted the laptop into FW target mode, and successfully copied the home folder (about 40GB) onto my Mac. The laptop may be a brick at this point, but the data is rescued. Mission accomplished.\n\nA: As a first step, I would try ejecting from the Optical drive again. However, this time try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the PowerBook is switched off\n\n*Press the mouse button (or trackpad button) down and keep it down\n\n*Restart the PowerBook and keep the button down until something ejects or you get the same language prompt again\nAssuming this ejects a CD/DVD, then try the Install disk option.\nNOTE: If these steps don't work, you may want to try again with a USB mouse if you didn't already (just in case there's an issue with the trackpad).\n[EDIT]\nIf you can't use the Optical drive, then you have two options. \n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase a FireWire cable (as you've already noted) and use Target Disk Mode\n\n*Remove the hard drive altogether and use it in an external case/enclosure\n\n\nOf course, option 2 will depend on whether the intention was to still use the PowerBook and whether or not you feel comfortable with the hard drive removal.\nIf you'd like to determine your willingness to do this, here are the instructions for doing so with that PowerBook (based on your description).\nOne advantage of this approach (besides the fact you can pick up external cases for next to nothing) is that you can potentially still use the hard drive as an external drive once you've recovered the data. You can also then choose to reformat and reinstall the system and replace it back into the PowerBook (if there is still a purpose for it), or place another HD into the PowerBook. \n\nA: I don't have a 10.4 system available to test with, but I think you should be able to get enough of the OS running to access a USB flash drive by going into single-user mode, then running the command sh /etc/rc. If that doesn't work to mount the flash drive, try running ls /dev/disk* again and see what if it lists /dev/disk1 and /dev/disk1s; if it does, you should be able to mount the drive manually with mkdir /Volumes/flash and mount /dev/disk1s<something> /Volumes/flash. If that doesn't work, you might have to specify the volume type with e.g. mount -t hfs /dev/disk1s<something> /Volumes/flash (for a Mac-formatted drive) or mount -t msdos /dev/disk1s<something> /Volumes/flash (for a FAT-formatted drive).\n\nA: I recently needed to reset the password on my iBook G4 (PowerBook 6,5) and I did it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the machine and hold command (the apple key) and S key while it is turning on until you see some text. This starts the machine in single user mode. \n\n*Next, you need to mount the file system and make it writeable with the following commands: \n    /sbin/fsck -fy\n\n    /sbin/mount -uw /\n\n    sh /etc/rc\n\nType the first command above, then click enter and wait until the process stops. (You know the process has stopped when you have a # after the \"root.\") Then, type the second command and click enter and wait until the process stops. Then, type the third command and click enter and wait until the process stops. \n(Tips: 1. The spaces in the commands are important. 2.

According to google, as of 10.10 there is an undocumented \"--xz\" switch for tar but I can't get it to work. On linux there is a \"-J\" switch that allows for xz compression but that isn't supported directly on OS X.\nThe man page for tar references xz compression but does not show a working example of how to use it. My other searches all result in something similar to:\n    tar cf - some_dir | xz -1 > some_dir.txz\n\nHowever, decompressing that from the command line is less than intuitive and requires xz to handle the decompression before handing the file off to tar. \nSo, what's the \"state of the art\" in using xz compression directly from tar?\n\nA: Looking at the source code for the libarchive package from Apple Open Source for OS X 10.8.5, 10.9, 10.10, and macOS 10.12.3, of which contains the source code for bsdtar, it includes the ability to use xz compression directly in tar, however it was not implemented at compile time until OS X 10.9.0 and later. Although the manual page bsdtar.1 doesn't show the -J, --xz options even though it's in the bsdtar.c source code.\nTo create an xz compressed tar archive in OS X 10.9 or later use the following syntax examples:\ntar -cJf filename.tar.xz /path/to/folder_or_file ...\n\nOr:\ntar --xz -cf filename.tar.xz /path/to/folder_or_file ...\n\nExample:\ntar -cJf Documents.tar.xz \"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nOr:\ntar --xz -cf Documents.tar.xz \"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nI also checked the Documents.tar.xz file after it was created in a Hex Editor and it did have the proper header which included the expected 7zXZ portion of the signature.\n", "Q: Why do some people take a photo, then a screenshot of the photo and only then share it? I see screenshots of pictures in the Photos app all the time. For example:\n\nSo someone took a picture, then went to Photos app, took a screenshot of it, then went to Photos app again and only then shared it. Seems like two steps too many to share a pic.\nAnd I see it everywhere: on Craigslist, at my friends houses printed out on the walls, it's ridiculous.\nThe only explanation I can think of would be a cheap hack to save some space on disk and/or traffic due to the fact that a screenshot is smaller than the original image. But the kinds of places you normally see this suggest that it's probably some form of ignorance. It's just that usually ignorance is a shortcut. But here we witness a detour.\n\nA: It's likely this question will be closed because it's primarily opinion-based.\nHowever, one potential reason why some people may choose to take a screenshot of a photo before sharing it is due to privacy concerns. \nFor example, if I take a photo with my iPhone 6s and view the EXIF data, it will show that the photo was taken with an iPhone 6s, which camera was used (front or back), the exposure, the Date and Time, the Location (an actual address where possible), etc etc. In fact, there's over 50 fields of data if viewing the full record. However, if I take a screenshot of that exact same photo, and view the EXIF data of that, I will see almost no information beyond the fact it's a screenshot, the resolution, file size, and a guess of when the screenshot was taken.\nYou can prove this to yourself by using an online EXIF viewer to upload a photo. There are many of them around, but for example you could try http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi and upload a photo from your phone to view its data. Then take a screenshot of that same photo and upload that instead.\nIn summary, for some users it probably isn't just a cheap hack to save some space on disk and/or traffic due to the fact that a screenshot is smaller than the original image.\n", "Q: Create an iCloud account on my friend's iPhone I don't have an Apple device, but I'd like to try iCloud Mail on my PC. Can I create an iCloud account on my friend's iPhone, then sign out on his device and use the account on iCloud.com? If so, doesn't it erase his iPhone data or cause any problem whatsoever?\n\nA: If all you need to know is whether it will erase your friend's iPhone data, the answer is no. \nWhat your friend will need to do is sign out of their iCloud account via Settings > iCloud.\nAfter signing out, what happens depends to some degree on what version of iOS your friend has installed, whether they have other Apple devices, etc. However, the worst case scenario is that when they sign back into their iCloud account all their iCloud data will sync back to their device with the exception of any photo stream photos older than 30 days. (Of course, if you're only going to use it for a very brief period to create the account, and then sign out of it, this won't be an issue as they'd be signing back in not long after signing out).\nHowever, I do strongly recommend that your friend does a manual backup of their device to iTunes (on their computer) first. This is just an extra precaution in case something unexpected happens.\nAlso, your friend may get some emails from Apple (e.g. about Find My iPhone being disabled, etc).\n\nA: No need to use an iPhone. Just create an iCloud account through Apple's web site as outlined here:\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-iCloud-Account\nEssentially, the link says to go to appleid.apple.com and create an Apple Id.  Using that Apple Id, you can log into icloud.com and use the icloud services there.\n", "Q: Unable to open file in Preview even though I have all permissions I've been storing image files on Dropbox (uploaded automatically from my phone via their \"Camera Uploads\" feature).

(See screen shot - I have removed my log-in name from the picture).  I am using MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 on a MacBook Pro (early 2011).\n\n\nA: The issue is due to missing fonts. (Where the system picks a poor choice to substitute for the “missing characters”). If you use font management software, be sure to reinstall or re-enable the system fonts.  \n\n1. Run validations with Font Book\nLaunch Font Book and press command-A to select all fonts. Then from\n  the \"File\" menu select \"Validate Fonts\" and wait for the results in\n  the font validation window. Keep in mind that even though you may find\n  minor problems with your current fonts, its best to follow the saying\n  \"if it's not broken then don't fix it\", and leave well-enough alone\n  unless you're experiencing problems.\n2. Clear the font cache\nIn OS X, fonts are handled by the Apple Type Server process, which\n  stores commonly used fonts in a cache for quick access. If there is\n  corruption in this cache then you may experience a variety of\n  troubles. To clear the cache, in pre-Leopard versions of OS X go to\n  the /Macintosh HD/Library/Caches/ folder and remove the\n  \"com.apple.ATS\" file. After doing this, restart the system.\nFor OS X 10.5 and later, you cannot easily access the user and global\n  font caches, but you can use Apple's \"atsutil\" terminal command to\n  manage the ATS process. Open \"Terminal\" and enter the following\n  commands to clear the user (or global) databases and restart the\n  server:\natsutil databases -removeUser atsutil server -shutdown atsutil server\n  -ping\nNOTE: Use \"sudo atsutil databases -remove\" instead of the first\n  command to remove the database for all users.\n3. Avoid older font formats\nIf you can, avoid \".dfont\" and \"Type 1 PostScript\" fonts. This\n  suggestion may depend on the requirements for various programs, but if\n  you have an older font suite that you are thinking about installing,\n  it may run into problems with newer programs so you might consider\n  getting an updated version of the suite before installing. Granted you\n  can always try, but there is the potential that older font formats can\n  cause problems so we recommend you stick to the more modern \".ttf\" and\n  \".ttc\" fonts.\n4. Manually clear out duplicates\nFont Book has an option to \"Resolve Duplicates\" (available in the\n  \"Edit\" menu), but this is limited in functionality and may not remove\n  the specific font duplicate which you desire to remove. As such, the\n  best approach to managing duplicate fonts is to do it manually\n  (tedious, but effective if done correctly). In Font Book, you can use\n  the \"Show Font info\" option (command-I) to see information about a\n  selected font, and especially where the font is located on your\n  system. Doing this for your duplicate fonts will allow you to select\n  which one to remove, either by removing it from its font folder, or by\n  right-clicking it and selecting \"Disable\".\n\nFrom: https://www.cnet.com/news/font-problems-and-management-in-os-x/\n\nA: Try going to Applications/Font Book/ and do File > Restore Standard Fonts and restart.\n", "Q: Do I need to format Macbook Pro md101hn/a?

Is this a bug in 10.12.3?\n\nA: 1) If FileVault is encrypting your disk you will see corestoraged as a blocking process.\n2) If Time Machine is encrypting an external drive with backup corestoraged will be also blocking sleep (even if the backup disk is unmounted and not connected to the Mac!!!).\n➜  ~ pmset -g\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\nstandbydelay         10800\nstandby              1\nwomp                 1\nhalfdim              1\nhibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\npowernap             1\ngpuswitch            2\nnetworkoversleep     0\ndisksleep            10\nsleep                10 (sleep prevented by corestoraged)\nautopoweroffdelay    28800\nhibernatemode        3\nautopoweroff         1\nttyskeepawake        1\ndisplaysleep         10\nacwake               0\nlidwake              1\n\nIn my case, it was the Time Machine.

I'm using Sierra OS. Here are some things that I would like to understand:\nI like to work on two desktops and have some windows belonging to 1st desktop and some to 2nd desktop (think Unity). When I create a second desktop I would logically think that I can move one of existing windows to it, but right-clicking on the app in \"dock\" only shows: All desktops, This Desktop, None. Using the ^1, ^2 shortcuts brings the window to selected desktop but then shows it on the other desktop where it came from as well. Maximizing the window and restoring the size back to original will bring it back to original desktop as well, which seems to be a bug?\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a good way to assign windows to desktops if there is any in mac?\n\n*Is there a software that can override this annoying functionality? Another windows management package?\n\n*Why does any maximized window appear on the very right side even it belongs to the most left desktop? Any way to stop this?\n\n\nI already tried looking for answers on the web, but haven't found any good solution, only mirriad of useless articles.\n\nYoutube video\n\nA: I'll take your points in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can assign entire applications to desktops, but I don't know of any tool that can assign specific windows to desktops, at least out of the box. Maybe you could whip something up with Hammerspoon and Lua scripting.\nI've never actually used Hammerspoon, I've just heard about it. If you decide to go this route, good luck!\n\n*That's not actually how you move windows between desktops. That dock menu is for the entire application, not the specific window. (Windows actually don't even have window management menus at all!) To do this, grab the title bar and press ⌃← / ⌃→ or do a 3- or 4-finger trackpad swipe, or hold the window at the edge of the screen for a moment. You can also move windows between desktops with \"Mission Control\", a combination of Expo and Scale. You get to that with ⌃↑ or a 3- or 4-finger trackpad swipe up.\n\n*It sounds like you're talking about fullscreen, not maximizing; it seems to just work that way. Unlike in Unity, though, the window no longer belongs to any desktop -- it's in its own space, all by itself. You can drag it between any of the other spaces, of course, if you want it over by the left again.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to maximize your window instead of fullscreening it, ⌥ (option)-click the green(by default) title bar button.

And if so, any issues?\nI was doing Geekbench benchmarks and found this profile:\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/1046173\nNotice the 2133 MHZ RAM installed on that unit. Clearly, he's able to boot and run his Mac and run all Geekbench 4 tests. \nI'm tempted to test it out myself to see if there are any overall system performance increased (boot time, app launch, etc..) but I can't find where to buy that 2133 MHZ 204-pin RAM. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Just in case you weren't aware, while Apple only officially supports 8GB RAM in your model MacBook Pro, it is in fact capable of running 16GB RAM and many users have done just that. So, if you currently have 8GB or less, you can certainly see some real benefits by upgrading to 16GB RAM (depending on your usage).\nAs for using 2133 MHz DDR3 modules, it seems they're working okay for rburkat based on his Geekbench results. In reality, the original 1333MHz spec used by Apple is a minimum speed. However, how much your MBP can take advantage of faster memory will depend on the logic board and processor.\nIn terms of purchasing compatible memory at various speeds for your MBP, you can refer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacSales.com - US and others\n\n*Flexx - UK\n\n*RAM City - Australia\n\n*Mac Fixit - Australia\n\n*Simply Mac - South East Asia\n\n\nA: I have 16GB of HyperX Impact 2133 MHz DDR3 RAM installed in my 17-inch Macbook Pro Late 2011 2.4 GHz running El Capitan (MacOS 10.11.6). I purchased the RAM on Amazon: Here Geekbench 4.0 shows an overall 5% increase in performance over the previously installed 16GB of 1600 MHz RAM. Some of the benchmarks improved by over 10%. Multi-core memory bandwidth increased over 27%!\nHowever, there does appears to be some stability issues that have occurred since the install. I have been logged out in the middle of work (twice). PowerPoint has crashed (once). I had one crash using dual monitors. Also, GeekBench 4.0 has become unstable. My computer was running very stable prior to the install. I've had the 2133 MHz RAM in my rig for about a week and am still using it. I'll update this post if anything changes. I'm sticking with it a little longer mainly because I already have the RAM. I'm not sure the minor improvement in performance is worth the expense and reduction in stability. One more crash and I'm pulling the memory.\nAnother important thing to note is that Geekbench shows dramatic reductions in CPU performance when other applications are running (even when they are idle). So, if you're addicted to speed (like I am), you can achieve a much more significant performance boost by closing unused applications. This can give you an overall performance boost of over 20%.\nI've attached a GeekBench comparison between my old 1600 MHz DDR3 and new 2133 MHz DDR3 RAM:\n\n", "Q: \"suggestd quit unexpectedly\" means what?

Say I had an iMac (assume newest models) with 2 external displays (USB-C/Thunderbolt 3?) in my office. If I bring my (assume latest) MacBook Pro into the office and would like to use it rather than the iMac, could I connect the MacBook Pro to the iMac and then use the iMac and the 2 displays connected to the iMac as monitors for the MacBook Pro? \nIf so, what would I need to do to accomplish this? \nUpdate: (I realized I didn't clearly state my goal)\nGoal: I would like to have a desktop station in the office, but a laptop for when I'm out and about. If I was working on something on the laptop and don't feel like waiting/causing some sort of syncing between the laptop and desktop, i'd like to just use the laptop as the computer and the displays for more screen real estate. (Usually, I would just use the iMac in the office and the laptop when i'm not in the office)\nUpdate 2: Perhaps a KVM switch is the way to go? Maybe they don't yet exist for thunderbolt3, but maybe this would be the best way? Have 2 monitors that go through a KVM to get to the iMac, but could also get to my laptop this way?\n\nA: Short answer:  No, this can't be done.\nAt the very minimum you would need to set your iMac into \"Target Display Mode.\"  The last iMac that will support this is the Mid 2014.\n\nNow, if you happen to have a compatible iMac (not the \"newest model\" you referred to), it still wouldn't work.  Target display mode turns your iMac display into an external monitor for your compatible MacBook with a Thunderbolt port.  It doesn't turn it into a \"thunderbolt hub.\"\nI am assuming you don't want to use the iMac and instead just use your MacBook and your goal is to get three monitors going...  I suggest just getting a third monitor and hooking that up to your MBP and bequeathing your latest iMac to a worthy coworker.  I am a huge proponent of finding the simplest solution and not layer it with complexity.\n\nA: Short Answer\nYou're going to run into a number of hurdles, and what you want to do will be impossible to do the way you want to do it. And, it will be almost impossible to achieve the final overall result.\nLong Answer\nBelow is a breakdown of the issues you face and the one possible solution I see that doesn't in itself achieve what you want the way you wanted to.\nTARGET DISPLAY MODE\nFor starters, you wouldn't be able to use the latest iMac in Target Display Mode as the only iMacs to support this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Late-2009 27\" iMac\n\n*Mid-2010 27\" iMac\n\n*Any iMac from mid-2011 to mid-2014\n\n\nLEVERAGING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS\nYou may have some limited success with a software solution. For example, people use Air Display to use existing iMacs as monitors for other devices/computers. However, this and other software solutions can be a little hit and miss, and then it's only to connect to the one Mac as a display.\nTHE EXTERNAL DISPLAYS\nThe other issue is that you want to access the two external displays while they're still connected to an iMac which itself is going to be used as a display, so I don't see how you would achieve this.\nTHE CLOSEST SETUP I CAN SEE TO WHAT YOU WANT\nAs far as I can tell, the closest you would get to achieving what you want is to do something like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect each of your two external displays directly to the MacBook Pro\n\n*Use software such as Air Display to use your iMac as a monitor\n\n\nHow successful this will be, and exactly how you achieve this (cables, hubs, docks, etc) will depend on your exact model of 2016 MBP and the models of external displays you have.\n", "Q: Problems with resetting and old MBP \"An error occurred during installation...\" I'm trying to factory reset an old MBP, not sure how old but somewhere between 2009-2012.

I apologize deeply if I have broken a rule. That was not my intent in posting this\nMy first thought with my Mid 2011 iMac was a graphics card failure that apple announced a recall for and then later ended approximately one month before I had my unfortunate event. I was using a low end application (Diablo II) when I hit an orange screen followed by the WSoD. I didn't panic (yet). I had a lot of boot option to try to fix this. I ran through everything I could find on the web regarding various boot options and disc repairs. These would all start to work but die with a small percentage of the progress bar left to fill. This would be met with a full-width artifact just before WSoD.\nTo this point, and after a lot of struggling, I joyously was able to boot main drive through target disc mode. So I am at a worst case scenario of transferring all my data to an external drive and then (hopefully) clone the drive for further use.\nI am experiencing the protracted \"Stopping\" on transfers that I have seen all over the net without much help.\nWhat should I do next? Any ideas? All help will be welcome.\nAnd assuming it is the graphics card (AMD Radeon HD 6970M), and ballpark ideas on repair costs? The sell and buy new may be an option if the numbers work right.\n\nA: Given that Apple was offering free replacements, my recommendation is to go to a physical Apple store location and ask for a replacement. Apple still services these machines, and will be willing to quote you a price for replacement. There's a good chance that they'll offer to replace it for free given the circumstances, though the fee is up to their discretion.\nFailing that, you could replace the GPU yourself. The GPU is an MXM board slotted into the logic board; while it's not the easiest thing to repair, it is serviceable. \n\nUnusually, iFixit doesn't have a full repair guide for this model, but the limited guide should be enough to get you most of the way there. A 6970M or 6770M should work.\n", "Q: How to make Google Chrome Helper not use as much CPU I've found solutions for this problem but they dont seem applicable now in 2017.\nFor some reason, Google Chrome Helper is using a lot of my CPU and fans are going full blast.  I found this link on Apple's site that seems to help everyone but I can't seem to find it on my version of Chrome.  I have a MBP running 10.9.5.\nThey mention to go to Chrome > preferences > settings > show advanced settings > content settings (under privacy).  Then click the 'click to play' button under the Plugins section.  However, there's no plugins section and so I can't do this to try to fix the problem.  I'm using Chrome version 56.0.2924.\nI don't have many extensions installed on Chrome (just Webex, Google docs, Okta).  I have Flash installed too, which I think is taking some resources but there are times I'm not watching video or using anything with Flash and it's still using 150% CPU.\nWhat workaround can I do with this version of Chrome to make Google Chrome helper from using > 150% CPU?\n\nA: Invoke ⋮ Chrome Menu → Window → Task Manager to see what exactly consumes CPU. Because the helper is a black box from the OS' side of view. I personally found a mining extension that way.\nAlso watch for ad content and ad blockers in an escalating war, endless refresh and block cycles.\n\nA: Chrome, or any modern browser, is not so much directly or itself a problem here.\nFlash on the other hand is a problem in itself. If uninstalling system-wide Flash and the one that is embedded within Chrome are not an option, you should at least prohibit it from autoplay.\nMisbehaving plugins or extensions might play a role too. Those mentioned by the OP are unfamiliar to me. Starting without them might lead to satisfactory results. They are certainly not needed on every site you visit. It may help to use different browsers or different profiles for one browser. One browser(-profile/account) for work, another one to ordinary surfing.\nThe main fault that drives this resource hog is on the web itself. \nOn really old fashioned sites you will not see so much pressure on the rendering and javascript engines that are demanding so much CPU.\nFirst line of defence against this is to block the grossly overused advertising and user profiling or user tracking that dominates almost every page out there. Any adblocker is of tremendous value here. \nSecond fault is mostly connected to ads as well but comes with a few additional nasties. Bad design on the pages themselves. That includes  javascript abuse, bloated CSS, the Google enforced autoloading of additional content, dozens of cross site requests, big media elements. On most major sites you do not load a web page anymore. You load a bit of content that allows dozens of programs to execute around that.\nTo soften the resource usage of a browser it is necessary to \n\n\n*\n\n*reduce the number of extensions in the browser\n\n*block ads, \n\n*allow javascript only were it's strictly necessary for the core functionality of the sites you visit\n\n*never to let anything autoplay\n\n\nSince all these tips not only save your electricity bill and bandwidth everywhere they should also enhance your security and privacy.\nSo look for these search terms in Google's webstore: adblock, security, privacy and block. (follow the links and use the terms for a personal search in the extensions repository of your browser of choice.)\n\nA: 150% seems like an awfully high number, even for Chrome. I'd recommend disabling extensions and such temporarily and seeing if one of them is potentially causing the issue.\nIf, however, you find that nothing seems to work, you can limit the resources available to Chrome. Limiting the resources provided is pretty easy (provided you're willing to work with a little bit of third-party software.) You can use cputhrottle to limit the usage at the system level (better explained here.)\n\nA: It really depends...none of the answers above worked for me, until I disabled each extension one by one and found that it was the Adblocker. Thank goodness Chrome makes it easy to switch these on and off!\nAs soon as I launched Chrome, CPU would jump to 240%, before opening up any sites.\nWeird thing is that I've had this Adblocker extension installed for at least two years, and it just started happening this past week.\n\nA: For me it was ad blocker!\nEating 40% of CPU time to time.\n\nA: Okta seems to be the culprit here (as in the site itself) if I open up my Okta pinned tab then the CPUs spike to 100%+ and if i kill the helper process the Okta site crashes out with the 'Aw, Snap!' sick folder screen\n\nA: the chrome helper is called \"Keystone\" which helps update chrome. you cant stop it, its just a thing with chrome. I'm not sure if the developers at google are aware of this issue. uninstall chrome, including all of the chrome files. use a different browser temporarily, safari, edge, Firefox, opera, brave, etc.\n\nA: For me, it was the Google Mail Offline extension.\n\nA: I recently faced similar issue and discovered that the problem is Chrome browser itself which has trouble handling rich websites (a lot of animations causing frequent screen repaints) on 4K screens. 4K screens compared to regular Full HD screens have 4 times more pixels that needs to be painted on the screen. Because of that a lot of animations requires more CPU power to draw all that on screen.\nThe same site on Firefox performed a bit better. On Safari it was much better but still far from perfect.\nIt may not be an answer to OP's question but for sure is one of the factors when it comes to browser's CPU usage in those neat ultra high res screens.\n\nA: A note, after using the Chrome Menu → More Tools → Task Manager trick and finding that you have a background tab consuming high CPU amounts: if you don't want to close the tab yet, it may be enough to do right click → Reload, without viewing the tab (leave it in the background).\nThis keeps the tab handy for when you're ready to deal with it, but prevents Chrome from starting up animations.  \n\nA: Click on \"not secure\" icon on address bar and block JavaScript.\n", "Q: VMware Fusion taking too long to expand disk?

Likely apps with native networking implemented (example: apps that use Foundation's NSURLSession).\nRunning an iPhone 7 on iOS 10.2.1 in China with frequent DNS hijacking happening before you even have time to connect to VPN, so rebooting the device would not be a sufficient solution.\n\nA: Turn on/off of the Airplane mode in the Settings.app or Control Center makes it fast to flush the DNS cache.\n\nA: I had an iPad mini that wasn't flushing DNS when I tried turning on/off Airplane mode, nor was it flushing DNS when I tried turning on/off Wifi. I had also cleared the cache and cookies, but no cigar.\nWhat worked for me was completely rebooting the device. \n", "Q: Apple Watch, keep calendar-details during entire meeting I mostly use the \"modules\" watch face since I can have my next meeting in the middle. However I noticed now that the current appointment I have will disappear and show the the next appointment before the current one has actually ended. This is a big problem for me since it is very important I always know when my current meeting ends so I can close it in the right time.\nSee the image below, the \"J4\" meeting will be removed from the watch face before 10:50. I want it to stay until 10:50 or at least 10:45. Is that possible?\n\n\nA: \nHmm, that's wierd, it's OK for me.\nTry these:\n\n\n*\n\n*check if WatchOS is latest version\n\n*check if your calendar is synced with the end-date in your iPhone / iCloud Calendar.\n\n\nFor me it works without any hassle.\np.s.

I know it can be disabled, and its current rules viewed, but is there any way to add your own protected directories?\nThanks\n\nA: It is possible to add your own protected directory to SIP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery Mode and disable SIP\n\n*Reboot and create a directory structure.\n\n*Flag the whole folder or single files or folders:\nsudo chflags restricted /example\nsudo chflags restricted /example/example.app\nsudo chflags restricted /example/subdir/file\n\nor a folder hierarchy:\nsudo chflags -R restricted /example\n\nIf you want to exclude a subdir after using the -R option you have to remove the restricted flag there:\nsudo chflags norestricted /example/subdir\n\n\n*Boot to Recovery Mode and enable SIP\n\n\nNow the folders example, example.app and the file /example/subdir/file are protected. You still can add or remove files to/from /example/subdir.\n\nThe restricted flag has no effect if SIP is disabled - the usual POSIX/ACLs permissions apply. With SIP enabled the files/folders are protected.\n\nIt is also possible to add, remove or change SIP-protected files and directories via an installer package which is signed by Apple’s own certificate authority. Since a normal user /customer usually doesn't have access to this certificate authority, this possibility is eliminated.\n\nAn earlier version of this answer asserted that it is required to modify the file /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf and add something like:\n                                /example\n                                /example/example.app\n*                               /example/subdir\n                                /example/subdir/file\n\nThis is wrong! Simply flagging a file or folder as restricted is sufficient to protect it. \n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way to modify which directories SIP protects; SIP is either on or off. Apple appears to make no mention to such an ability in their developer documents either.\nDisregard this, @kanomath has a better answer. The latter part of my answer still stands to a limited degree.\nIf you want to lock down configuration files, modify the filesystem permissions either through the Finder GUI or the command line utility chown.\n", "Q: Installing nova client: PIP Permission Denied even as root I'm trying to install nova client on OS X 10.12.3\nI tried to install with sudo pip install python-novaclient.\nI wan't to access openstack server from OS X\nInstalling collected packages: requests, six, PrettyTable, Babel, oslo.i18n, iso8601, funcsigs, pyparsing, monotonic, netifaces, netaddr, wrapt, debtcollector, oslo.utils, simplejson, msgpack-python, oslo.serialization, positional, stevedore, keystoneauth1, python-novaclient\nException:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/basecommand.py\", line 215, in main\n    status = self.run(options, args)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/commands/install.py\", line 342, in run\n    prefix=options.prefix_path,\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/req/req_set.py\", line 784, in install\n    **kwargs\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/req/req_install.py\", line 851, in install\n    self.move_wheel_files(self.source_dir, root=root, prefix=prefix)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/req/req_install.py\", line 1064, in move_wheel_files\n    isolated=self.isolated,\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/wheel.py\", line 345, in move_wheel_files\n    clobber(source, lib_dir, True)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/wheel.py\", line 316, in clobber\n    ensure_dir(destdir)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg/pip/utils/__init__.py\", line 83, in ensure_dir\n    os.makedirs(path)\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/os.py\", line 157, in makedirs\n    mkdir(name, mode)\nOSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/requests'\n\n\nA: As per this StackOverflow answer, sudo pip install is a rather unsafe practice in that it attempts/allows/intends to modify system Python libraries.

I was not able to refuse changing my hostname by DHCP Server on Mac Book.\nNone of these solutions below worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I stop Mac OS X overriding my hostname when I receive a DHCP request on Snow Leopard?\n\n*Mac refusing to change hostname\n\n*Computer name keeps changing (deleting files)\nAfter deleting the files as suggested from the Apple engineer it retrieved a new hostname and a new ip. But it wasn't a static hostname. Creating the file /etc/hostconfig doesn't work neither. \nI mean come on, that's a well known feature and it should work. Poorly it doesn't for now. I'm sure there must be a solution for this.\nAs the server we are using a Mac Mini with built-in DNS and DHCP. My Mac Book's system is macOS Sierra 10.12.3\nEdit: From the 3rd link, the Apple engineer suggested to delete the following three files in /Libray/Preferences/SystemConfiguration:\ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\nNetworkInterfaces.plist\npreferences.plist\n\n\nA: Open /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist with Xcode and add to the ‘ProgramArguments’ array with the string --no-namechange. Save the file and restart the machine.\n\n\nA: It took a LOT of Googling and digging to get this, but I finally found a solution that works. DHCP overrides the LocalHostName system property, but not the HostName property. By default the HostName is not set in macOS Sierra, so you can set it as well as LocalHostName and ComputerName using scutil:\nsudo scutil --set HostName yourcomputername\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName yourcomputername\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName \"Your Computer name\"\n\nThe HostName property appears to be permanent. LocalHostName can still be overridden, but it won't override HostName once it's set.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016: Keyboard key stuck – how to remove key? Regularly different keys on my new MacBook Pro (2016) are stuck. I assume little pieces of dirt or small crumbs interfere with the mechanics. With older Mac keyboards, I occasionally removed individual keys for cleaning. As the keyboard of the current model was redesigned, it seems much harder to do so now and I can’t find any tutorials.\nSo: How do I remove (and reinstall) a key of a MacBook Pro (2016)?\n\nA: I found a fix for the sticking spacebar - do not remove the key - it will easily break and you may not get it back on. take a bendable plastic card like an insurance card - stiffer than paper, and gently lift up on the key until you see some space underneath it.  Then use a can of air (found at hardward store - get the one that has a straw on it) spray air under the key and then lift the key in a different area and blow under it again until you have cleaned the whole thing,  It should work after that. Mine did.\n\nA: Be aware that damage to the keyboard trying to fix it, should be the last option as this will void any warranty.\nIt can be handed in to your local Apple for a review or follow Apple's own guide for removing dirt under your Macbook.\nSee here.: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to remove the keys safely and clean them.\nBut first, it is important to know how it looks below the keycap in order to not damage anything:\n\n\n*\n\n*The key cap is attached to the mechanism by two claws and two hooks. the hooks (left side of the image) are at the bottom of the cap and they would break if you lever up the cap from there. The top side is held by claws (right side of the image) which can be unclipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n*The butterfly mechanism has a round surface on both sides that touch the whole button cap. That is where the problem comes from: since there is a big contact area it can stick together easily (fluids) or become clogged. I actually spilled whine into my keyboard and many keys were affected, but I did not break a single one doing it as follows. You will have to lever the top side of this mechanism up, gently, to unattach the keycap.\n\n\n\nSo, just be careful and do exactly as described below! \n\n\n*\n\n*First, take a thin tool (a needle works fine, but I guess a thin plastic tool is better), squeeze it into the gap above the key and gently lever it up, until you can reach below the rim of the cap with a second tool or your fingernail. \n\n*The first tool will likely be under the butterfly hinge which is why you have to release that one and make sure you are only just under the cap with the second one (short fingernail is the safest option). Now lever up (with the second one/your fingernail!) until it pops of with a slight clicking sound.\n\n*Now you have to untangle the hooks at the bottom side. Hold up the top side just a bit and very gently wiggle the key around, left right up down, until it is loose. Do this really gently! It should not make a clicking sound or anything since it isn't really attached to the hinge!\n\n*I mostly just cleaned the top side of the hinges with my finger or a soft cloth, but you can reach underneath the hinges, if necessary, with a fine brush.\n\n*To reattach the keycap, slide the hooks underneath the cap back into place from bottom to top. Then press the key (slightly upwards, that is in the direction of the screen, so that the hooks stay in place) until the top clips back in again.\n\n\nThere you go.\n\nA: I had the same issue with a stuck / spongy Enter key, and after reading through this Reddit thread I just did what people were suggesting there – strongly blow air on it and keep on hammering the key at the same time – and it fixed the issue, they key is nice and clicky again!\n", "Q: Scripts on mac. Auto execute from USB? I have written a simple script for macbook and later found a program called platypus which makes an .sh file to an .app\nNow I want to ask if it's possible to launch that app from the USB automatically as soon as it's plugged in?\nAnd if somehow yes. Does it also work if the mac is closed or just in login Screen?\n\nA: No, this wont work. This is one of the advantages of macOS, it does not execute stuff that is found on a USB drive.\nI consider this a great deal when we talk about security.\nHowever there are devices that look like an USB thumb drive, but when plugged in expose themselves as a HID (Human Interface Device) and then execute keyboard shortcuts to run their exploits.\nFor example the USB Rubber Ducky Deluxe is such a device.\n", "Q: Way to maintain same screen ratio on data projector as on Mac laptop In giving presentations from my MacBook Pro on an Epson Data Projector (VGA connection), there is I have invariably found a decrease in the display dimensions. Initially only part of the previous screen area shows, but can be reset to fill the smaller screen.\nNormally — for example with a PowerPoint presentation — this smaller size is OK, but today I was accessing one of my websites directly from the laptop to illustrate its features in my seminar. The problem was that I had written the HTML/CSS so that the site was ‘responsive’, and one aspect of this responsiveness was that certain features were not shown at the viewport size of mobile devices. The viewport matched the dimensions I had set in the stylesheet for the iPad and I ended up not being able to demonstrate some of the features.\nFailing all else I could record and show a movie or temporarily change the stylesheet, but my question is whether there is any way of changing the resolution of the data projector display from my Mac.\n\nA: Your projector probably has a maximum native resolution of XGA or 1024x768 (standard iPads have a resolution of 1024x768 points). Some projectors will allow you to send a higher resolution signal and scale it down for you. Most projectors I have seen don't do a great job, but it at least functions. To see if your projector will do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your Mac to the projector\n\n*Ppen the Displays panel in System Preferences\n\n*Option-click the \"Scaled\" option for the resolution of the projector. \n\n*Select a 4:3 resolution higher than 1024-768 (e.g. 1280x1024)\n\n\nIf the projector goes black, wait and your Mac will timeout back to 1024x768. \nThe other option is to purchase a VGA scaler (For example, the Kramer VP-426 takes VGA input and then outputs VGA). You need hardware that will take  one of the various formats your Mac can output and output at XGA (1024x768). What the hardware will do is let your Mac output a higher resolution, forcing the web page to render the \"desktop\" size, but output it to the smaller resolution projector. But honestly, purchasing a scaler for this purpose is overkill.\n", "Q: Safari is very slow I have been noticing that Safari has gotten very slow lately. Has anyone else had this issue recently?\nIt must have been after some update, could have been some time ago so I won't know which, maybe Sierra, Safari has become very slow when loading pages. It is not a connection issue as I have tried it at different places, also it can't be a issue with the settings, as I ran into the problem again even with a brand new MacBook Pro.\nI could use chrome but I don't want to :)\n\nA: Tested your network connection speed?\nI recently had a similar performance hit with Safari.

On a mac this shouldn't bee too much of a problem, since the password is persisted in the keychain, at least as long as you still have access to machine the backup was created on.\nThe problem is that iTunes asked to set the encryption password when that options was checked several months ago, and never again. I created a backup moments before resetting the device, which worked just fine, but was unable to restore from the backup because of the lost password. I was sure that this would be the iCloud account password and only saw the error when it was too late.\nI had a look around the iTunes files on the Windows machine where the backup was created and found a file named keychain-2.db, which seems to be an sqlite db with some probably encrypted data (or binary blobs?). The tables inside are named cert, genp, inet, keys, sqlite_sequence, tversion. \nIs there any possible hope of restoring the backup encryption password through this? I don't have a lot of hope, since I haven't found anything regarding this idea online so far. Should any more information be necessary or just interesting, I'd of course love to provide it. \n\nA: Various ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried any typo variations on your iCloud password (since you mentioned you thought it was the same)? Another goofy thing about the backup encryption is that there's no second password field to ensure it's typed correctly.\n\n*If I remember right, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker's free trial will let you preview two characters from the backup password on Windows in case that will help trigger your memory. I'm not sure if it's compatible with iOS 10.2 and later backup encryption yet though. (I don't work on this program, but I work on other software that reads iPhone backups, and sometimes I suggest this to help people remember their password ;))\n\n*Did you setup that iPhone by restoring from a previous encrypted backup? If so, the backup password should be the same password for the backup you set up from.\nOtherwise, you're pretty much left to trying to put yourself in the mindset of a few months ago to remember what you would have used for a password. :(\n\nA: I don't think this will help but worth a check: have you looked in Credential Manager in Windows? Right click on start -> Control Panel -> User Accounts (or just type \"Credential Manager\" into Cortana)\n", "Q: How can I block an app from accessing my contacts? An app that has access to the list of contacts is capable, without further notice, to upload that information to a server. (If it has internet access, that is, but most do.)\nI am concerned of the breach of trust to my contacts that this entails. \nFor example, someone on my contacts list may have gone into some trouble to remain unlisted in any phone book, and yet their phone number could become near-public, depending on the privacy policy of the app, which I, like many, never bother to read.\nI'm here not even referring to app(s) that exist with the sole and express intent of making contacts lists public.\nIs there any way to be in control by choosing whether a given app has access to my contacts list, similar to how an app can have access to notifications, but I can disable its access to notifications while continuing to use the app?\nTo be clear, a messenger app becomes meaningless if it doesn't have access to contacts, but, for example, an app showing me the nearest grocer or coffee shop has no need to access my contacts. Please do not suggest \"Just don't install an app that gratuitously asks for permission to access contacts.\" Doing so leaves users in the stone age.

I read about a full charge cycle at least once per month - how is this done? Just purchased this wonderful machine, brand new, want to keep it as perfect as possible, and am not sure how to do a full charge cycle of the battery. \n\nA: FWIW, Apple's own advice no longer says cycling is recommended (but it used to) -- it now just focuses on things like turning off battery hogs like WiFi when not required, and storing the device half-charged if you're not going to be using it for a while.\n\nA: You may get a lot of opinions on this, but essentially calum_b is correct that while Apple used to recommend doing at least a monthly discharge/recharge cycle, they no longer recommend this (but that's not to say they recommend against it either).\nYou can read the entirety of what Apple says about their batteries here. \nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge your MacBook Pro battery as it suits you. You do not need to let the battery discharge 100% (or any percent) before recharging.\n\n*Apple have designed their lithium-ion batteries to reach 80% of their capacity quickly and then switch to a slower trickle charge to complete the other 20%.\n\n*Ambient temperature is a big factor in determining battery health/life. Your MacBook Pro is designed to work at its best when ambient temperatures are between 16° to 22° C (62° to 72° F).\n\n*Avoid exposing your MacBook Pro to ambient temperatures higher than 35° C (95° F)\n\n*If you ever need to store your MacBook Pro long-term without being used, then ensure it is switched off and the battery is only half charged.\n\n\nFinally, you should know that the latest research (from late 2016) has found that the biggest enemy of lithium batteries is time. Regardless of how you use your MacBook, your battery will be far less healthy in five years than it is now regardless of whether you've cycled it daily or never at all.\n", "Q: how do I get homebrew build a package (clisp) with the debug flag set Is there a brew --with-debug-flag-set package style command available to get brew to build a package that includes debug information.\nSpecifically, I would like clisp to be built this way so that disassemble works in the repl.\nI imagine something along the lines of:\nbrew install clisp --with-debug\n\nor somesuch.\n\nA: According to Mike McQuaid (Lead maintainer of Homebrew) this is not possible.\n\nA: A brew formula is a Ruby (.rb) file that contains the compile options inside.  Homebrew's brew install|reinstall allows specifying a URL instead of a formula name, so compile flags can be added to an online copy of the formula and hosted on a service like gist.github.com.\nHere's an example ruby file that has an overridden compile option.\ndef install\n   args = std_cmake_args\n\n   # OVERRIDE: Force cmake to use debug flags\n   args << \"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\"\n\n   system \"cmake\", \".\", *args\nend\n\nstd_cmake_args, defined in Homebrew's interneal formula.rb is a variable internal to all Homebrew cmake formula and provides sane defaults to each cmake build prior to adding additional arguments.\nThis example uses cmake, each project will have its own compiler tools and thus potentially different technique(s) for adding compile flags.  For example, to tell cmake to use Debug flags, it's args << \"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\"\nOnce these changes have been made to the .rb file and hosted online, you can reinstall the package with the new options using the --build-from-source command line option.\nbrew reinstall --build-from-source https://<path to formula>.rb\n\n\n\n*\n\n*WARNING:  If using gist.github.com, note that the \"Raw\" version is the URL that you want.  If not, it'll try to install the HTML (e.g. code preview) of the page, which won't work. :)\n\n*WARNING: Remember, this will reinstall the specified package in the Homebrew directory with debug flags, so the old \"release\" or \"optimized\" build will not longer be available.  So please remember to reinstall the non-debug version using the standard brew install technique once troubleshooting has been completed or else you'll have a debug version of a library on your computer until it's manually updated. :)\n\nA: As of the most recent update, you can now do this by adding the --debug-symbols option to brew install.\n", "Q: Power source event trigger Late 2014 Mac mini running Sierra connected to an APC BackUPS Pro 900.

What is the use of Login Window option in Mac. If user is already logged in, then what is the point of this option. When I select this option, it went to login window. Is it only to lock the Mac?\n\n\nA: Well, locking the Mac is certainly one reason for it, and a good one.\nAnother reason would be if you (or someone else) needed to also log into another account without first logging out of the current one.\nFrom your screenshot it appears that you do not have fast user switching enabled (probably because you may be the only user), but even if you had multiple user accounts and did have it enabled, the Login Window option would still be there as a way of locking your computer.\n", "Q: Which is the earliest Apple TV that can mirror an iPad? So, I need to mirror an iPad Air 2 (not just spare apps, the whole screen and audio) wirelessly to a projector, and I was thinking of buying an Apple TV. However, since the current version is so expensive, I thought of buying an older one (say, TV 3rd Gen version A1427, A1469 or 2nd Gen). Somehow, I couldn't find this in the Apple help (I guess... because they update it to the latest version, sometimes \"hiding\" previous ones).\nWhich is the earliest version that can (decently) screen mirror an iPad?\n\nA: The Apple TV 2 is the earliest Apple TV that supports AirPlay Mirroring, being the earliest Apple TV capable of installing Software Update 4.4, which added the feature.\n\nAirPlay Mirroring: Wirelessly stream what's on your iPhone 4S or iPad 2 screen to your HDTV.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202157\n", "Q: Will the Battery of my MacBook Pro 15\" 2016 deteriorate if it is plugged in charging all day? I am using my MacBook pro 15\" 2016 everyday and attached to it I have got a DELL Monitor 25\" QHD. In order to use the monitor as main screen my MacBook pro needs to be plugged in charging all the time.\nWill the battery of the MacBook deteriorate because of this?\nThanks\n\nA: To my knowledge it is more or less a consensus that Li-Ion batteries require regular discharge to keep the electrons moving. This article is one of the most comprehensive I know on the issue. It states that one should avoid low and high temperatures, regular deep discharges, and permanent full charges. The author recommends to use the battery from time to time with shallow discharge cycles. \n\nA: You may get a lot of opinions on this, and also potentially risk having your question closed because it is primarily opinion-based. \nHowever, I will try and answer this solely by keeping it to the facts.\nFirstly, you should read what Apple has to say about their batteries. \nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge your MacBook Pro battery as it suits you. You do not need to let the battery discharge 100% (or any percent) before recharging.\n\n*Apple have designed their lithium-ion batteries to reach 80% of their capacity quickly and then switch to a slower trickle charge to complete the other 20%.\n\n*Ambient temperature is a big factor in determining battery health/life. Your MacBook Pro is designed to work at its best when ambient temperatures are between 16° to 22° C (62° to 72° F).\n\n*Avoid exposing your MacBook Pro to ambient temperatures higher than 35° C (95° F)\n\n*If you ever need to store your MacBook Pro long-term without being used, then ensure it is switched off and the battery is only half charged.\n\n\nFinally, the latest research (2016) has found that the biggest cause for ruined batteries is time. In other words, you can purchase a brand new MacBook Pro battery and leave it in a cupboard for five years* and then find it's capacity is greatly diminished when you finally start using it.\n*Just an example - the research did not specify a 5yr period.\n[EDIT - Time a key factor in battery degradation]\nI was hoping to edit my answer to cite a source (and provide a link) re my paragraph above about the latest research showing that time on its own is one of the key causes of the degradation of Lithium ion batteries. Unfortunately, while I thought I had the research saved in my Reading List and bookmarks, I wasn't able to find it - so will keep searching and will add it in due course.\nHowever, just to elaborate a bit on this (and other) research, it is still clear there are a number of factors that affect Lithium batteries: the State of Charge (SoC) - both during storage as well as at commencement of charge - charge cycles generally, the recently discovered (in 2014) formation of crystals as lithium ions pass through cathodes and anodes, and so on. \nThe new  finding from the research I was wanting to cite was primarily that a Lithium battery does actually start to degrade after manufacture as a result of time, regardless of how it is (or isn't) used (although the effect of this is pronounced by the number of charge cycles etc). I did find this quote from an ABC Science News article that may be based on the research I'm looking for:\n\nLithium batteries don't age gracefully\nFrom the moment they're made, lithium ion batteries start losing their\n  ability to store charge and generate a voltage over time. It's called\n  ageing, and it happens whether they're being used or not, so check the\n  date of manufacture when you buy a lithium ion battery.\nThe ageing is caused by chemical changes at the electrodes. The\n  positive electrode isn't a solid lump — it's made of microscopic\n  particles of a lithium-based material. Over time those particles\n  coalesce together forming bigger lumps, so there's less surface area\n  for the lithium-releasing reaction when the battery is being used\n  (discharging).\nAnd recharging doesn't send 100 per cent of the lithium ions back to\n  the negative electrode — some ions always get permanently stuck to the\n  positive electrode. So over time there are fewer positive lithium ions\n  'in play' in the battery.\n\nSource: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-15/rechargeable-batteries-how-they-work-why-they-blow-up/7081286\nThis finding is particularly relevant because many people still buy a second or spare battery and mostly keep them in cupboards until they eventually need them, but the better process would be to swap the batteries regularly to lengthen the overall lifespan/health of both batteries.\nRegardless, I am sure we will see lots of research (and some of it contradictory) and the advice offered by Apple (and others) will change over time. I still remember Apple offering an iCal reminder (via a .ics file download) that users could download to remind them to charge and discharge their MacBook batteries! Now they don't even tell people to bother, let alone offer a downloadable reminder!\n", "Q: iPhone won't turn on after screen and battery replacement The Problem\nI just replaced the battery and screen of my iPhone 5. The phone does not appear to be working at all. There is no response from the phone after doing a hard reset and the phone will not respond to the mute button. There is no backlight.\nThe only thing that seems strange is that the home button is a bit wobbly.\nWhen I plug the phone into iTunes, it says it can't access the phone because it is locked with a passcode.\nI have tried pressing all sorts of different buttons, and the only thing that gives any sort of response is plugging into the computer.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: If you can afford to lose the data on it, you might try using 'Pwned' DFU mode, which is a sort of factory firmware flashing mode similar to recovery mode, or Android's Download Mode. Once the device is in DFU mode (steps below) iTunes should tell you that it has detected an iPhone in restore mode. Choose to \"Update & Restore\", and iTunes will download, verify, and install the newest iPhone 5 firmware to the phone. When it is done the device should be accessible. If the screen still does not respond afterware but iTunes continues to interface with it, it is an issue with how the screen was installed, in which case you should (obviously only if you were the one to replace it or know what you are doing) open the iPhone, find the ribbon cable connected to the screen, disconnect it, ensure that there is nothing that would cause interference with the connection (dust particles, fuzz, etc.) and reconnect the ribbon cable. Apple uses a strange ribbon cable design and I have found in the past that it sometimes seems as though one is fully connected when it is not.\nSteps to enter DFU mode: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Disconnect the iPhone from your Mac. \n  \n*Hold BOTH Power & Home for 20 seconds. \n  \n*On the 20th second, let go of the Power button but KEEP holding the Home button for an additional 30 seconds. \n  \n*Your screen should be black, reconnect your iPhone to your Mac and if it worked iTunes should report that the connected iPhone is in recovery mode and needs to be restored. \n  \n*Either Click \"Update & Restore\" to auto-download and install the newest firmware for your device from the Apple servers, or hold down the \"Shift\" key while clicking the button to install a custom .ipsw firmware file (will only work with firmware built and signed by a licensed Apple Developer account).\n  \n\n", "Q: Time Machine Backups taking too much space? Yesterday, I installed an external hard disk for my Time Machine — well, a 1.6Tb partition of a 2Tb hard disk. I am running a new iMac with 512Gb SSD. The internal drive is about half full.\nAfter a day, I have about 5 backups, and I find that I only have 448Gb available.\nI am still trying to get the other folder sizes (understandably, this is taking a long time), but the first backup folder is about 250Gb. At a rough estimate, this suggests that the subsequent backups are about the same size. At this rate, I will run out by tomorrow.\nI understood that the Time Machine backups are sort of differential, and that subsequent backups are mostly links to the original backup files.\nThe question is: is the size, being mis-reported, or is that a correct estimate of the space used?\n\nA: I would probably do two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Let time machine run until it fills up the 1.6 TB and then see how long a windows you have. macOS will clean up the destination - purging old files as needed. \n\n*Use tmutil compare or a tool like Backup Loupe to check what is taking the space. Other tools do a lousy job of showing you actual space usage in time machine. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why does Time Machine estimate a 109GB backup size, but then need 235 GB?\n\n*Time Machine - List of Files that were backed up\n", "Q: How to write text to an RTF file, while maintaining the style of a document template, in AppleScript?

In theory, is it possible to run Windows OS off a flash drive, so that on starting up the machine, if the stick was in the USB slot, it would startup on that 'hard disk' and run windows programs off it?  \nI'm basically asking because I'm having nightmarish issues trying to get Bootcamp to partition my drive and run Windows on the partition. I've been searching the problem and it seems to be an ongoing problem going back to 2014, which amazes me.\n\nA: In theory, yes, but in practice it would be quite slow and cumbersome doing so from a flash drive. \nMy suggestion would be to search here for an answer to whatever your Bootcamp issue is (or ask a question about it). \nHowever, if you really want to bypass the internal drive, then I would recommend using an external hard drive (instead of a flash drive) to run Windows from. Be aware though that the process for doing this is quite involved. For example, read this question for one way to achieve what you want.\n\nA: Yes, is the short answer. Here's a guide for 8.1 but the same remains true for W10. The only difference here is that you would need to partition the USB drive s it's bootable on startup.\nhttp://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-8-1-on-mac-without-boot-camp/\n", "Q: \"macOS Sierra Update\" could not be verified I tried updating my new MBP from macOS Sierra 10.12 to 10.12.3 using the App Store.

I tried several times to update again using the App Store but it gets stuck with the same issue. Any hints how to complete the update to 10.12.3?\n\nA: I was able to update by using the combo updater for 10.12.3.

Would this be possible perhaps in some form of a Target Display Mode?\n\nA: There's no native way to do this. However, you may be able to achieve what you want through the use of software. Below are some options I can think of that you could test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synergy\n\n*Remote Desktop Connection\n\n*Team Viewer\n\n*ShareMouse\nHow well any of these work for you (or meet your needs) will depend on your particular requirements.\n\nA: Install Synergy on both the Mac and the PC. What you are talking about is software KVM for Keyboard, Video, Mouse. You will be able to move your mouse from the laptop screen to the PC screen. When your mouse pointer is on the MacBook you can use its keyboard to type there, when it is on the PC your keyboard will type on the PC. There is also a function to share the clipboard between them, so that you can copy something from your Mac and paste onto the PC and visa-versa. \nTarget Disk Mode is something else, it's to use one Mac as an external hard drive for a second Mac. http://osxdaily.com/2010/04/07/how-to-boot-a-mac-in-target-disk-mode/\n", "Q: Headphones unexpectedly stopped working?

I have the following accounts\n\n\n*\n\n*A personal iCloud account that secures my keychain / Facetime\n\n*A personal iTunes account\n\n*A work developer account for the App Store (not shared, I exclusively use it)\n\n\nQuestion\nHow can I enable Two Step, or Two Factor for more than one accounts above?\nBackground\nI have a mid-2012 Retina, a 2016 MacBook Pro, Watch 2, and iPhone 7.\nI use the same iCloud account on all devices, therefore I can only use two factor authentication for one account listed above.\nWhen I try to reenabled \"two step\" authentication for the other accounts, I don't see the option anymore within the idmsa portal.\nHow do I enable either 2 step, or 2 factor in the above scenarios?\n\nA: Two-factor authentication\nMacworld has a great tip on enabling two-factor authentication for an iTunes-only Apple ID (or any Apple ID not being used as the iCloud account on an iOS device):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new user account on your (or a friend's) Mac.\n\n*In the new user account, log into iCloud with your iTunes-only Apple ID.\n\n*Enable two-factor authentication (iCloud preference pane > Account Details > Security tab).\n\n\nIt may be a bit cumbersome to switch to this Mac user account though, if you need to manage your Apple ID often.\nMacworld also has some tips on using your trusted phone number(s) to receive verification codes when you don't have a trusted device nearby.\nTwo-step verification\nIt may no longer be visible in the Apple ID web management interface, but you can still enable two-step verification if you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple Support page for two-step verification, under the section How do I set up two-step verification?, click the link \"Set up two-step verification now.\"; or\n\n*Click this link: https://appleid.apple.com/manage/security/2sv/enrollment\n\nA: You should be able to enable two-step authentication for the iTunes account by going to appleid.apple.com and logging in on that account. It's an option under the Security section. I just did this (and I have a similar setup to yours) and it works. You won't be able to use the option of allowing notifications to be sent to devices using Find my iPhone, since they are presumably using your iCloud account. The developer account I'm afraid I can't help on.\nIt would certainly be nice if we could enable two-factor authentication instead, but I can't find any way to do that.\n\nA: I can only manage one such “two” account so I have my personal account protected with the extra steps / no more security questions.\nWe use 1Password at work, so my work account has a pretty long password and totally made up long passphrases for each security question and the details are escrowed with 1Password teams so that my peers aren’t locked out if I cannot be reached for whatever reason.\nFor your iTunes account, I suggest “Family Sharing” so that the majority of the purchases can all fall under the main personal AppleID.\n", "Q: How can I lower the TouchBar brightness level?

However, I suggest you do as I have and submit feedback to Apple requesting this option.\nHopefully it will be introduced in an upcoming macOS Sierra update.\n", "Q: Apple Mail - Outlook Exchange account I have been using my outlook exchange account for a while already with Apple Mail on 10.12.3\nEverything work just fine, until couple days ago, it doesn't login anymore, I get error about Username / Password combination miss match...\nHowever, login to outlook it self from webpage works just fine. Also, I'm using same mail account with iPhone with apple mail as well. I checked the login details, and even tried that same password to iPhone and it works...\nWhere to start debugging ?\nEdit: All other non outlook emails work just fine, unfortunately I don't have second outlook account to test with...\n\nA: I believe that Outlook.com actually uses Exchange 2016 (correct me if I am wrong here...) So if you are using outlook.com or a Work (MS Exchange) email account it should be similar.\nI administer an Exchange 2013 server and find that from time to time Apple Mail loses it's mind (EG connectivity, etc.) with the Exchange account. I have found the best and quickest way to solve this issue is to delete and then re-add the account from Settings > Mail > Accounts.\nNote that Exchange servers store everything (messages, calendar data, contacts) on the Exchange server so deleting the account doesn't cause loss of data unless you have lost connectivity and the mail.app (and Contacts and Calendar) hasn't pushed out your recent changes.\nAbout a year ago (maybe more) I switched my work email account to the (free) Microsoft Outlook email app for IOS. It is an excellent mail client plus it has calendar and contacts built into it as well. And I have NEVER had a problem with it losing connectivity or forgetting the password. So I keep my personal email in the Apple mail.app and all the work email in Outlook. It's a good solution, IMHO. \n", "Q: Recover /private/etc/ssh after accidentally deleting I'm working with macOS Sierra and I have accidentally deleted /private/etc/ssh.\nHow can I recover this folder so I can use SSH?\nThe last solution is to reinstall the OS, but I want avoid this.\n\nA: After deleting your ssh folder and no backup you can reinstall some content using the macOS installer and recreate the keys yourself:\nThe default content of /private/etc/ssh in El Capitan or Sierra are these files:\nmoduli                          ssh_host_ed25519_key\nssh_config                      ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub\n(ssh_config~orig)               ssh_host_rsa_key\nssh_host_dsa_key                ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\nssh_host_dsa_key.pub            sshd_config\nssh_host_ecdsa_key              (sshd_config~previous)            \nssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub          \n\nThree of the files are part of the macOS installer and can be extracted and installed from the Sierra OS X Install ESD with Pacifist: moduli, ssh_config and sshd_config.\nAll other files can be created by using ssh-keygen or copying files:\nsudo cp /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/ssh/ssh_config~orig #just a backup\nsudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config~orig #just a backup\n\nKey creation:\nsudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\nsudo ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\nsudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\nsudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n\nThis may invalidate some services relying on the old keys!\n\nA: In my El Captain machine, /etc/ssh contains these files (but some may be leftover from previous OS versions):\nmoduli                          ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub\nssh_config                      ssh_host_key\nssh_config~orig                 ssh_host_key.pub\nssh_host_dsa_key                ssh_host_rsa_key\nssh_host_dsa_key.pub            ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\nssh_host_ecdsa_key              sshd_config\nssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub          sshd_config~previous\nssh_host_ed25519_key\n\nYou may be able to recreate the keys with ssh-keygen.

This didn't happen in El Capitan.\nI first noticed this in the Slack native app, where I could enter a code block by surrounding some lines with triple backticks, like\n```\nsome code\n\n```\n\nBut apparently the same happens in e.g. Chrome. As I wrote the example above, typing three backticks and pressing enter gave me four backticks instead of jumping to the next line. But if I do the same thing in Safari, it works like it used to in El Capitan.\nI believe the Slack app was done using MacGap, i.e. it uses OSX's WebView, so the issue might have something to do with that as well. Then again, MacGap takes advantage of WebKit and thus I guess the problem should also occur in Safari (and perhaps not Chrome), if it trails back to WebKit.\nI use a Scandinavian keyboard with the input source defined as Finnish. It seems to also contribute to the problem, as I can't reproduce it if I switch to US input source.\nDoes anyone know of a way to fix this – other than switching to a US input source?\n\nA: A colleague of mine contacted Slack about this and their response was:\n\nWe are aware of a related bug within Chrome and, as our newest app is closely linked with Chrome, it is unfortunately also affecting us in Slack. In this case, it's not something we can directly fix ourselves, but we've escalated it to the relevant parties.\n\nSo I guess this is not really directly linked to Sierra as is. But I'll leave the question here in case someone runs into the same problem.\nAnd if you know a fix or a nice workaround, I'll be happy to hear it.\n(So far the best I know of is pressing space after entering the backticks which isn't that bad. It still adds a key press to my usual flow but life just isn't always perfect. :) )\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Text\nIf ‘Use smart quotes and dashes’ is checked, uncheck it.\nNow check if  the problem still continues.\nI had a similar problem & doing this fixed my problem, not sure if it will work for you or not. Let me know the result.\n", "Q: Why is Terminal complaining \"-bash: export: `PATH;': not a valid identifier\" When I start terminal I get the error \n\n-bash: export: `PATH;': not a valid identifier  \n\nWhy?\nI've looked in the two files which I think bash uses at startup, and I cannot see an issue:\n/etc/profile\n# System-wide .profile for sh(1)  \n\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then  \n        eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`  \nfi  \n\nif [ \"${BASH-no}\" != \"no\" ]; then  \n        [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc  \nfi  \n\n~/.bash_profile\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/autoconf/bin\"  \nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/automake/bin\"  \nexport VISUAL=vscodeeval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)  \n\n(N.B. The file /usr/libexec/path_helper is binary, and /etc/bashrc does not contain the text 'PATH'.)\nWhere is the error coming from? I cannot see PATH; with the trailing semicolon in either startup profile.\n\nA: Look at the output of path_helper -s:\n$ /usr/libexec/path_helper -s\nPATH=\"...\"; export PATH;\n\n(The actual value assigned to PATH isn't important; I've elided it here.)\nThe output is intended to be executed with eval, as it is in /etc/profile. The purpose is to provide an initial value for the PATH variable, then set the export attribute on the name.\nIn your .bash_profile, you are unnecessarily executing it again, but also incorrectly letting the output be used as additional arguments to an export command. The line\nexport VISUAL=vscodeeval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s) \n\nis treated as \nexport VISUAL=vscodeeval PATH=\"...\"; export PATH;\n\nexcept the semicolons are treated as literal characters, not command terminators. Thus, it tries to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set VISUAL to vscodeval and set the export attribute on VISUAL. That's OK.\n\n*Set PATH to an initial value (ending with a semicolon, which would not be what you want, but syntactically not an issue) and set its export attribute.\n\n*Set the export attribute on a variable named export. Unnecessary, but not an error.\n\n*Set the export attribute on a variable named PATH;. That is your error, since a variable name cannot contain a ;.\nThe fix is to just remove the $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s) from your .bash_profile; it only needs to be executed once from /etc/profile.\n\nA: Just to turn fd0's comment into an answer, the offending line in my ~/.bash_profile file is the last one\nexport VISUAL=vscodeeval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)  \n\nRemoving that line fixes the problem and appears to have no bad effects.

Unfortunately Spotify didn't complete install, so there was only the grey app tile and after trying to delete it it remained as an uncompleted grey tile with just a number as name:\n\nSo I tried to delete it, but after confirming that all other data of that app will be deleted the app is still there. Pressing on the app has no effect. Reinstalling Spotify leads to having Spotify as a additional app - full functional. \nI already made a soft reset (several times) also tried to delete it via iTunes (there it doesn't show up), via memory management (doesn't show up there neither). Finally I did exclude it from iCloud backup (shows up there - I know, it's funny). \nBefore I take the step to do a factory reset and recover the phone via backup - does anybody know what I can do else?\n\nA: First, try resetting your home screen layout\nResetting your iPhone's home screen layout should clear icons from apps that aren't downloaded (the relevant app icon appears to not be downloaded). This only involves moving icons around to suit your desire after the reset, no other data will be lost.\nGo to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Home Screen Layout.\nTip: take pictures of your old layout before resetting to make the process smoother.\n\nIf that doesn't work, do a factory reset\nDoing a factory reset and restoring your phone from a backup should fix this issue because the reset will clear all of your app icons and start the home screen from scratch.\nHere's how to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your iPhone to either iTunes or iCloud (if you choose iTunes, make sure to do a complete backup). How do I backup my iPhone?\n\n*Perform a factory reset of the iPhone after the backup completes in Settings > General > Reset. How do I factory reset my iPhone?\n\n*During setup, choose to restore your iPhone from another iPhone and choose the backup you just made. How do I restore my iPhone's data from a backup?\n\n*Watch as all your data returns (allow a few hours for apps and photos to re-download), almost definitely without the odd app icon in question.\n\n\nNote: data from apps that specifically request data not be backed up (like Google Authenticator) will be lost.\n\ntl;dr: try resetting home screen layout first, but if that fails you'll need to do a factory reset.\n\nFun tidbit: You just found out Spotify's SKU, a unique ID for an app in the Apple system that is not seen by users.\n\nA: Actually the best way is to back up your phone (password protect the backup so you don't lose your account passwords), then erase all content and settings and restore it.\n\nA: SOLVED. I HAD same issue.  Cleared enough memory to fully download app(uber) and the numbers turned into uber.  Deleted app from there easy peasy lemon squeezy \n", "Q: I have a movie that no longer plays on iTunes or my iPad A couple of years ago, I downloaded the movie Sita Sings the Blues, put it on iTunes on my Mac and on my iPad.

But dragging any version to iTunes gets me the beach ball and I have to force quit iTunes.\nMy iTunes/iPad have other movies (.mov, .mp4, & m4v) that work fine.\nAny suggestions on what my next step should be?\n\nA: Can you upload it to iCloud Drive? You might be able to then try playing on the iPad directly without having to go through iTunes. If you have VLC on your iPad it should be able to play almost any file that you throw at it.\n\nA: Which ipad model do you own,different iPad model has different playback settings such as video codec, bit rate, frame rate, resolution and audio codec, bit rate, sample rate and channels settings.\n", "Q: Shell script to combine PDFs, renaming output I am trying to automate some accounting tasks. For this purpose I have employed Noodlesoft Hazel's help to rename and sort documents. However, I am stuck at trying to combine PDFs that really belong together (i.e. invoice from vendor with receipt from payment portal for the same purchase).\nMore specifically, the names of the documents to be combined have the same first part, say:\n2017-02-01 Vendor1 - invoice1234.pdf\n2017-02-01 Vendor1 [PayPal] - transactionID.pdf\n\nIs there a way to combine them automatically (i.e. running a shell script in Hazel), possibly using pdfunite?

In other questions, such as \"How to properly update git on mac?\" it is implied that Apple Git isn't as good as using separately installed versions of Git. What are the downsides to using Apple Git?\n\nA: There are currently no downsides but there have been times when the Apple release was behind and missed useful changes.\nThe only downside is that it is not the latest version and so missing new features and bug fixes (and probably some regressions).\nXcode 8 includes git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78).\nLatest source release on git home page is 2.11.1 but latest maintained build is 2.10.1 \n", "Q: Ignore \"prevent sleep\" request from a specific app I sometimes have the problem that my macbook won't sleep, even with the lid closed.\nAfter some investigation I tracked the problem down to Spotify app; when the app is open, even if no song is playing, my macbook won't go to sleep and eventually go out of battery power.\nI don't have need of spotify keeping my mac awake (for obvious reason I'm ok with a video player or a game instead); is there a way to ignore its request for preventing sleep without affecting other applications?\nI know I could quit spotify when not using it, but I am prone to forget it and it's very annoying to find my mac completely drained...\nEDIT: to be clearer, I am not looking for a solution about Spotify specifically (I could simply uninstall it and forget about it), I am just looking for an option which is the default in both Linux and Windows, that is that the user always overrides any setting when he/she closes the lid.\n\nA: Your MacBook should always sleep when the lid is closed. If your Mac is not sleeping with the lid closed, this suggests a problem.\nThere are exceptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some MacBooks can be plugged into external displays and, once connected, the MacBook's lid can be safely closed without triggering system wide sleep.\n\n*Previously it has been possible to install a third party kernel extension to override macOS's behaviour and stop sleep with the lid closed. Doing this carries risk and should be avoided.\nBlocking Sleep\nIt is difficult for user space processes to block sleep. Sleep assertions should never block a user initiated sleep, either via closing the lid or requesting sleep from the Finder. Use pmset to view current power assertions:\npmset -g assertions\n\n\nA: I sometimes have this issue with Spotify.\nAn application can block sleeping even when laptop's lid is closed, ie by calling:\n[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] beginActivityWithOptions:NSActivityUserInitiated reason:@\"Good Reason\"];\n\nI suppose we shoudn't do that to prevent AppNap but the documentation is not very clear.\n\nA: To manually initiate a sleep on the mac and override 'Preventing Sleep' applications run\npmset sleepnow\nin the terminal\nEdit\nI agree, the Apple spec is flawed, Apple need to fix this!!!, there should definitely be a way to override the 'prevent sleep' system wide, however the above is the best workaround I've found...\n...and if you want something that does a bit more checking (some apps I've discovered still prevent sleeping with the above command)\nfunction slp2 {\n  #add a list of programs here that you will always wish to close\n  pkill -x qemu-system-i386\n  pkill -x qemu-system-x86_64\n  sleep 2\n  assertion=$(pmset -g assertions | egrep 'PreventUserIdleSystemSleep');\n  canSleep=${assertion:34:1};\n  if [ $canSleep != \"0\" ]; then\n    say \"cannot sleep, please close offending applications\"\n  else\n    pmset displaysleepnow\n    say \"goodnight, rest well\"\n  fi\n}\n\nYou can also assign this to a Keyboard Maestro command so you don't need to open up a terminal and type in.

I want this space to merge with other drive: Macintosh.\n\nA: You've created a disk image, which is basically just a file. You haven't partitioned your Macintosh disk, as can be seen if you select Macintosh in Disk Utility.\nTo remove the disk image, unmount the disk image using the Eject button next to Disk Image, then delete the file using Finder.

But now I'm stuck in recovery mode.\nI used the Reiboot tool on my Windows 7 laptop, but that didn't work, so it prompted me to download the firmware, since the software was damaged. I did, but I have to pay to begin the process with Reiboot. Is there any free way to fix this?\nNote: I've also tried to use the 'Tiny Umbrella' tool on my laptop, and that won't even start.

This doesn't seem to work on the new Macbook Pro with touchbar - you have to press the Fn key to show the F1, F2, etc. keys, and Fn+Command+F1 doesn't seem to do it.\nHere are my current keyboard settings:\n\n\nA: Workaround found, works for me, late 2016 MBP 15\":\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Press Fn key to > \"Show control strip\"\nfn + Command + \"screen brightness less\" (where F1 would be otherwise) = toggle mirroring\n\nA: The new shortcut is Command-Dim Brightness. It even makes sense in the following way: \nAssuming that you take advantage of the touch bar, and it displays the system controls instead of the function keys then the hand gesture is exactly the same as before when you would have pressed Command-F1 since the Dim Brightness button is where F1 would be: \n\nThe annoying thing is that if you have an application-aware touch bar configuration, then you have to bring up the system controls touch bar configuration first. \nThis is why, in some cases, the Display Menu (in the App Store) which adds a status item in your menu bar (and includes a Mirror Screen choice) is a good option. \n\nA: I have the opposite problem.. was lacking a stock option to disable this shortcut!\nI've remapped Cmd,F1 to display_brightness_decrement using Karabiner Elements - no need to interfere with other shortcuts!\nYou can install the key mapping from here: disable_cmd_f1_screen_mirroring by following instructions here: configuration-complex-modifications.\nAlternatively, to achieve this manually: you can place the following file in ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/disable_cmd_f1_screen_mirroring.json then activate it via Karabiner Elements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Karabiner Elements > Preferences > Complex Modifications > Rules\n\n*Add Rule\n\n*Enable your new rule\n\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Disable Cmd+F1 Toggle Screen Mirroring\",\n    \"rules\": [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Disable Cmd+F1 Toggle Screen Mirroring Shortcut (map to display_brightness_decrement), see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2793101\",\n            \"manipulators\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"basic\",\n                    \"description\": \"\",\n                    \"from\": {\n                        \"key_code\": \"f1\",\n                        \"modifiers\": {\n                            \"mandatory\": [\n                                \"command\"\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    },\n                    \"to\": [\n                        {\n                            \"key_code\": \"display_brightness_decrement\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\nA: Check out your options at System Preferences > Keyboard, under the “Keyboard” tab.

However, I would still like to know whether it’s possible to see who is actually connected.\n\nA: Other devices (including iPads, iPods, Macs, and other iPhones) connected to the same iCloud account as your iPhone will, if in WiFi range, automatically connect to your iPhone's hotspot when it's turned on (according to this Apple Support page and my personal experience). That means if any of your other devices are lying around, they will automatically connect to your iPhone's hotspot using iCloud.\ntl;dr: Other devices tied to the same iCloud account might automatically be joining your iPhone's hotspot network.\n\nA: When we use use bluetooth and usb wire at the same time while setting up hotspot, it will show 2 connections... if we remove usb cable it will show 1 connection... not to worry...nobody else is using your hotspot .... relax...\n", "Q: Is it possible to right click an item in finder an \"move to\" to move a file / folder to another location?

I'd like to be able to move items around my finder this way. \nUsually when I've got my laptop connected to a larger monitor I just pull 2 finder windows side by side and drag and drop to organise folders, but it would be really useful when on a smaller laptop screen to be able to do this. \nI'm running Yosemite 10.10.5.\n\nA: I have a Automator Service named Move Selected Items To....workflow and shows on the Context Menu in Finder as Move Selected Items To... when files and or folders are selected.

Change the Host intercept to whatever, and it will redirect to your \"site\" you run off your laptop for development. \nThis will run on port 53, so anything else that could disrupt the service should be shut down. \nBelow are the line numbers to add/remove your domains, the last is the interception of domain, the other two are for blocking unwanted hosts. \n 60-66\n 333-336\n 445\n\nbelow are the lines to make changes to\n        param['IP_self'] = '192.168.178.20'  # server ip here\n        param['HostToIntercept'] = 'mydomain.com'\n\nNote: Be sure to add the IP Address of the DNS Server to your test devices individually, also you may need to change the Self_IP located at the bottom of the script to your machine's IP, available by option-clicking the wifi button, or opening System Preferences -> Networking -> (Connection Name) -> Right hand side close to the top of the window.\nSources:  Personal Experience, PlexConnect, MiniDNS\n", "Q: Is it possible to make Preview prompt a dialog before quitting? I had multiple documents open in Preview, and then I accidentally pressed Cmd+Q, which quit the entire Preview program.

What software did original Macintosh developers use and what were common languages used to write that software? \nIn short, I am wondering what the original development environment was like.\n\nA: Actually the original Macintosh development environment was not on a Mac at all. Quoting from this article on Folklore.org...\n\nMacintosh development in the early days (circa 1983-1985) was done\n  using the Apple Lisa computer and its Lisa Workshop development\n  environment\n\nMost of the stories on folklore.org are written by the Apple employees who did the work and no longer work at Apple. A fascinating site. Careful, once you get started you may not come up for air for hours.\n\nA: It was called Macintosh Programmer's Workshop. \n\nMacintosh Programmer's Workshop or MPW, is a software development environment for the Classic Mac OS operating system, written by Apple Computer. For Macintosh developers, it was one of the primary tools for building applications for System 7.x and Mac OS 8.x and 9.x. Initially MPW was available for purchase, but Apple made it a free download after it was superseded by CodeWarrior. On Mac OS X it was replaced by the Project Builder IDE, which eventually became Xcode.\n\nThe languages used were Pascal (Object Oriented), C, and C++.\nThere is even a \"fan\" site (Geek-Central) that has additional info and download links.  \n", "Q: Identifying conflicting extensions in classic Mac OS I am experimenting with Sheepsaver and am having some problems. I've got it booting okay into Mac OS and have installed some games and other software. But I think I was a little too eager and installed too much without properly testing things and I'm experiencing a number of freezes. Actually, the screen freezes up and mouse pointer disappears but sound is still playing. \nAnyway, I remember in the good old days having some software installed on my Power Macs that listed what extensions conflicted with what.\nSo, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What was that software?\n\n*Is it still available?\n\n*Does it work in sheepsaver?\n\n\nA: I know exactly what you're talking about. It's called InformINIT and it was one of those tools that many of us Mac experts used to narrow down problems with. Even after Apple's Extensions Manager was released with Mac OS 7.5, InformINIT remained an extremely useful tool to identify those pesky control panels and extensions!\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you can still download it from here\n\n*Yes, it works within Sheepsaver!\n\n\nAs an aside, don't forget you can ask questions here about your Sheepsaver problems.\n", "Q: Tap on iPhone from Mac I have an iPhone 7 and I have a Google Cardboard that doesn't have a magnetic clicker. I would like to use an app, but it requires me to either tap the screen or use the VR clicker to click. Can I setup some sort of \"tapper\" on Mac so when I click a key on my Mac it taps the screen of my iPhone? (Software Program)\n\nA: It's not possible for an application to control an iPhone in this way without jailbreaking due to iOS restrictions.\nIf the device is jailbroken, you may be able to install a VNC server on the iOS device like Veency and use Screen Sharing on the Mac such that you can click on the Mac and the click will emulate a tap on the iOS device.\n", "Q: What does the arrow on the bottom left of the folder icon mean? \nAs you see the mysql and mysql-5.7.17-macos10.12-x86_64 under the local path.\nThe mysql folder icon has a arrow on the bottom left.\nDoes the arrow mean shortcut to the mysql-5.7.17-macos10.12-x86_64? Or if not, if it is a other mysql entity folder?\n\nA: The arrow means it is an alias or link, but it could lead anywhere. To find the destination, select the alias and press ⌘I (or right-click and choose Get Info), then look at the ‘Original’ path (or just open it and see where it leads).\n                                              \n", "Q: How to turn off keyboard lights on MacBook? All of sudden my keyboard on my MacBook Pro 2015 has started glowing. I don't know which key I turned on.

If you don't like that the illumination automatically adapts, you can turn it off in System Preferences → Keyboard → Adjust keyboard brightness in low light.\n", "Q: Unusual problem with Swoop on Mac OS 9.0.4 under SheepSaver I have setup SheepSaver with Mac OS 9.0.4 and it boots okay. I've installed software and games. One of those games is Swoop http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/swoop/\nI can launch Swoop and play the game ok. But after I'm dead and try to play it again, the game starts but then freezes. The music and sound effects keep playing, but pressing the keyboard keys or moving the mouse has no effect. The only response I can get is by forcing SheepSaver to quit. When I launch SheepSaver again, I can play the game again, but only once. During that first game I can play for ages, but when I'm dead it freezes again upon trying to play it again. Very strange.\nI used to play this game all the time in the Classic environment in OS X and never had any problems.\nI've tried setting up SheepSaver on another Mac and have the same problem in that installation as well.\nI've also tried changing the SheepSaver preferences - but all my changes have made things worse - the game either doesn't start or starts and freezes immediately.\nMy usual settings when the games works fine for one game are as described here http://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver_mac_os_x_setup\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what I can try next? \n\nA: Sorry it's taken me a while to respond, but as promised in the comments I've tried to replicate this problem at my end.\nThe good news is that I could in fact replicate the problem. The problem occurs on five separate SheepSaver installations on three different Macs (running Tiger, Snow Leopard and El Capitan). I've tried various preference settings, along with experimenting with Mac OS 8.6 and Mac OS 9.0.4 installations. I've also tried booting SheepSaver with extensions off, and tried playing Swoop without sound.\nLong story short, I couldn't play more than two consecutive games before SheepSaver froze.\nAs a final check, I tested Swoop on a standalone 2002 Quicksilver PowerMac G4 running Mac OS 9.2.2. Swoop plays flawlessly! :)\nSo, in a nutshell, I know this isn't the answer you were looking for, but I don't think you're going to get Swoop to work properly in SheepSaver. You could try some other emulation software, such as Basilisk, or purchase an older Mac capable of booting directly into Mac OS 9 (or running the Classic environment under Mac OS X). If you happen to want to try the Classic environment, post a comment and I'll happily test this for you (I have a couple of Macs that can run Classic OS under OS X).\nEither way, good luck!\n", "Q: Offline DNS resolution on Sierra I have configured dnsmasq to resolve all .dev domains to 127.0.0.1.

The company I work for uses MacBook Pros.  Mine is significantly slower and runs significantly hotter than my colleagues'.  I want to test the hardware to see whether there is a fault.\nAll the MBP's we use are Retina 15-inch Mid 2015, 2.5Ghz i7, 16GB RAM. The main software we use is VMWare Fusion running Windows 10 and the Mac version of MS Office. The machines are all running Sierra, but mine has run poorly since way before the upgrade.  The only quirk is that I use an external monitor, although my colleagues have used my monitor themselves with no problems.\nWhen VMWare is running, the fans are running full speed almost constantly on mine, and Windows can become almost unresponsive at times. My colleagues' machines run quietly and only occasionally run the fans (but even then the fans are run slower than mine).  I am also not able to run VMWare Fusion in Unity whereas my colleagues are.  (Aside from my infuriation, the sheer amount of noise mine makes has become a standing joke in the office!).  If I leave the Mac for a while,  it has crashed when I return and refuses to wake up requiring a reboot.  The external monitor occasionally goes black for a second or two.\nI have checked the VM settings and they are identical. I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*toggled these up and down, \n\n*wiped the VM image and created a new one, \n\n*reinstalled VMWare,  \n\n*copied my colleague's VM, and I have\n\n*wiped my Mac. \n\n\nI'm a Mac noob and am pretty much out of ideas, and so I want to check the hardware.\n\nA: Okay, the first things I would do are reset your SMC and NVRAM. Instructions follow.\nReset your SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can be reset as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nTake a note of whether the fans and/or anything else improves and report back.\nResetting the PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nNow to answer your question about testing the hardware. If resetting the SMC and NVRAM don't resolve your issue, you can follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n", "Q: One email address has two Internet Accounts I somehow have multiple accounts for the same email address - they both receive messages sent to that address but one (the POP) has hundreds of emails in the Inbox and Sent, going back years and the other (the IMAP) has four in, going back a week, and none out.\nIn Mail>Preferences>Accounts they both appear, one with a grey IMAP beneath it and one with a grey POP.\nIn Settings>Internet Accounts they also both appear, this time with a grey Mail and a grey Notes beneath them.\nIs there any reason why I should want this setup, and what is the best way to rationalise it (which I would like to do by removing the POP, but without losing emails)?\n\nA: You don't have two email accounts.  You just have two email protocols set up.\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nVirtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP. IMAP and\n  the earlier POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent\n  standard protocols for email retrieval, with many webmail service\n  providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail also providing\n  support for either IMAP or POP3.\n\nThe major differences between POP and IMAP is that POP supports the \"download and delete\" methodology and IMAP \"synchronizes\" its content between the server and client thus allowing you to have multiple email clients updated.\nWith the setup you have, the POP protocol negates any advantage you would have gained with IMAP since it downloads and deletes the message meaning there is no longer anything for IMAP to sync.\nSo, which one to use?\nIf you want sync'd emails across devices, keep IMAP.  If you have only one device and you want to save your emails locally, use POP.\nYou can remove your POP email protocol by deleting it, but if you want to save your messages, you can create a \"Saved Message Folder\" under the IMAP account and move everything from POP there.  Once copied over, delete the POP account.\n", "Q: How to use ImageMagick to bulk crop empty space on png files?

The gist of it seems to be clearing the system cache using this command sudo rm -r /System/Library/Caches could help ( assuming that is where the issue lies). You should also be able to hopefully figure out what is using up all the space with this command sudo du -chxd 1 / to see what is taking up all the space.\n", "Q: Safari extension for timed automagical tab switching. Does it exist? Can I create one? I can't find any extension that allows me to switch between open tabs every x seconds.....\nBefore I 'dive' into extension development I have to ask....:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a limitation in Safari's extensions system which would block the development of an auto tab switcher?\n\n\nA: This should be possible. The extension API gives you access to the SafariBrowserTab class, which allows you to activate a specific tab in a specific window. So adding an extension toolbar button that started/stopped the looped switching should be pretty straightforward.\n", "Q: Maximize safari window I have a problem, my Dock have enabled autohidding option. And when I set for example safari maximize window, and after it open new tab or run something from Dock, my Safari window become minus few pixels at bottom (red arrow on screenshot), how can I fix it?\n\n\nA: You can't overlap a window over the Dock. The Dock, even when hidden, will consume space on the side it is set on. A workaround is to move the window down such that the bottom of the window is where you desire (you may need to hold alt to disable sticky window edges), then pull up the top of the window. If you wish an app to consume the entire screen, you will need to use Full Screen.\n\nA: Move the mouse to the corner of the window where it becomes a resizing arrow and option double click to fill the screen, WITHOUT going into full screen mode.\nFor me, this covers the dock completely.\nMore details:\nDouble clicking on any side when the resize arrow is visible will move that side to the edge of the screen. Adding option makes it affect the opposite side as well.\n", "Q: Why are my menu bars always on my left monitor? I have a Macbook running OSx and have two external monitors plugged in. Unlike for all my colleagues, whichever app I use, in whichever monitor, the menu bar will always be in the top of the lefthand monitor. \nThis is obviously very annoying when using an app in the right-hand monitor or Macbook screen.\nHow do I get menu to appear on the same monitor as the app? I've found reference to something called Secondbars but supposedly the need for this was going to disappear in Mavericks.\n\nA: It depends entirely on one pref...\nSystem prefs > Mission Control > Displays have separate Spaces.\n\nThis will, however, completely change other aspects of your workflow.\nThe dock will always be present on each screen; you can no longer use screens in pairs, each is independent, so changing Spaces on one screen doesn't take the other with it; you can't have the same Space on both screens at once, but you can invert the left/right order of Spaces by swapping each on the other screen, via a 3rd Space.\nPersonally, as you can probably tell, I hate it ;-)\n", "Q: How to dim screen on Mac before going to sleep I would like my MacBook (on El Capitan) to dim the screen before going to sleep, so that I can hit a key to keep it unlocked if desired. Currently, there is no way to keep it from locking if it's started to turn off the screen.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: There's a free app called Caffeine which prevents it from going to sleep at all.  You can activate it indefinitely, or for a particular period of time.  I use it all the time.\nhttp://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/\n\nA: I called Apple about this and they confirmed that it's a 'feature' of High Sierra and told me there is no way to get it back. I do remember the option to slightly dim the display was there with previous versions but it's gone now and it will just go dark without warning. I think my iMac at work doesn't do this even though they are on the same version so it could be tied to some other setting. I will look into it Monday and come back.\nEDIT: I tried this on my work iMac and it does indeed still dim the display before going to sleep. I cannot find an option for it anywhere, so maybe Apple made it so that notebooks can't do that while desktops can?

Currently, there is no way to keep it from locking if it's started to turn off the screen.\n\nIt sounds like you don't need the old dimming action so much as you need a delay on the password lock following sleep or screensaver. \nOpen \"System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General\", and change the \"Require password … after sleep or screen saver begins\" dropdown from \"immediately\" to \"5 seconds\" or \"1 minute\" or longer even. \n\n\nA: This is a very interesting question and the given answers were enough in my case the first time I read this months ago.\nBut since the 5 seconds Security Setting does not quite satisfies me I wanted to look for a solution again\nI recently found out this command pmset -- manipulate power management settings as explained by the manual man pmset .\nSince I'm not sure about its use I tried to read the man(ual) and to better understand it I've even found out this article online but I'm not yet sure which is the corresponding setting for the old Snow Leopard 'slightly dimming feature'.\nCristian Moisei's answer is indeed interesting too, so I decided to compare both my systems by simply running this example showed inside the man pmset\npmset -g\n\n Prints a snapshot of battery/power source state at the moment.\n\nThis is the results from my Snow Leopard (10.6.8)\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n hibernatemode  3\n halfdim    1\n lidwake    1\n acwake     0\n womp       1\n sleep      0\n disksleep  10\n sms        1\n hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage\n ttyskeepawake  1\n displaysleep   3\n\nAnd this is the results from my El Capitan (10.11.6)\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n womp                 0\n halfdim              1\n sms                  1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            10\n sleep                0 (sleep prevented by AddressBookSourceSync)\n hibernatemode        3\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         3\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\nI've not yet found a solution so this cannot be defined as an answer, more like a lead.\nBut if you can check what's your settings maybe we could figure this out.\n\nI'm quite a noob and sorry for my english, not a native speaker.\n", "Q: Where does the iPhone save contacts? Does the iPhone save contacts in the internal storage, SIM card and iCloud (if activated)?\nI can see an option in Contacts to import from SIM.\nI wonder if the iPhone stores contacts in all these places.\n\nA: iPhone stores contacts in the location set by Settings → Contacts → Default Account. New contacts are stored on the internal storage of the device, and then synchronised with the account selected here. This can be iCloud if activated and selected.\nContacts can be imported from the SIM, but not saved to the SIM.\nNote: If you have no ‘Default account’ option in Settings → Contacts, it could be that there is only one account that syncs contacts.\n\nA: Storing contacts on sim card is a feature of older phones before internal storage was really a thing. the iPhone has the ability to import those contacts from the sim, I believe since day 1. However it has no ability to write the contacts to the sim.\n", "Q: What's the best setting of iPad for senior grandma? I know the question might be a bit subjective, but I'm really facing the problem and hopefully someone can help.\nI'm buying an iPad for my grandma. She is 80 years old, living in a rural area in China. She has very little knowledge of computers (but she has seen us using iPad and liked the look of it immediately), and she can't read that much Chinese (she never went to school). We want to connect her with video call (e.g. FaceTime, WeChat) regularly. I've tried to change the font size as large as possible, but it's still not large enough for her. Also, I tried to find a way to enlarge the icon size, but cannot find it. I'm wondering if there is a setting or theme special designed for a senior person like my grandma (that changes the iPad to have larger icons and text).\nSiri is not an option as my grandma only speaks a local dialect (not Chinese), a language Siri doesn't work in. \nWish someone with similar experience can help.\n\nA: There is a maximum text size when changing the text size from Settings → Display & Brightness → Text Size, however larger text sizes are available. To enable these larger sizes, go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Larger Text and enable Larger Accessibility Sizes, then increase the text size even further using the slider.\nTo increase the contrast of certain elements which may make the text easier to read further, go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Increase Contrast and enable Reduce Transparency and Darken Colors.\nYou can also enable the Zoom function (also under Accessibility) which enables a three-finger double-tap for zooming in on the screen.\nFurthermore, the Colour Filters allow for further customisation of the colours displayed. Accessible from Settings → General → Accessibility → Display Accommodations → Colour Filters, they \"can be used to … aid users who have difficulty reading text on the display\".\n                                      \nScreenshots ignore colour filters so the effect is not displayed above.\nA good way to find such settings is by using the search functionality in the Settings app.\n", "Q: $PATH looks corrupted, is my hunch about the fix right?

The highest external monitor resolution supported by my Macbook Pro is 2560x1600.\nWhat would I expect if I upgraded from my 1920x1200 external monitor to a 3840x2160 monitor? Those monitors are just making it into a reasonable price point.\nThe 3840x2160 resolution will of course not be an option, but is there a lower resolution that will give me a better picture than what I see in 1920x1200? This measure of quality is absolutely objective, BTW (and very easy to see by a seasoned eye).\nI understand that I would be able to use 1920x1080, doubling vertically and horizontally twice. I'm guessing the resulting picture quality would be worse than with a native 1920x1200.\nPerhaps a mode close to 2560x1440 or 2560x1600 would be possible. If yes, how ugly will the interpolation be?\nIf 24\" or 27\" 16:10 monitors were available at any resolution above 1920, I would have jumped on the chance, but somehow all monitor manufacturers decided that 16:9 (which is really suited for TVs, not for computer monitors) are the ones to build. The 30\" size is simply too large.\n\nA: You're right in theory that a 1920x1080 resolution will map perfectly onto a UHD (3840x2160) display, and you're also right that it will look worse than 1920x1200.\nHowever, most monitors will perform some sort of an interpolation (smoothing) for all resolutions other than native (source).\nWhile \"how ugly will the interpolation be?\" is subjective, I can however say that in my experience the interpolation doesn't drastically affect picture quality.  For instance, I have a Retina 5k (5120x2880) iMac, and I've compared UHD with WQHD (2560x1440) on it, and the UHD does indeed look better (though obviously not as good as 5k).\nSo if you do get a UHD monitor, I would say the 2560x1440 resolution would look the best. The 2560x1600 mode will suffer from an anisotropic scaling problem -- images will look squashed vertically (see this link).\n", "Q: Inserting blank lines into RTF file with AppleScript Can someone tell me what is the best way that I can automatically insert a blank line at the top and bottom of these newly-created .rtf files, for these two separate pieces of code?\nFirst piece of code (for when the clipboard contains rich text):\ntry\n    set richTextfromClipboard to get the clipboard as «class RTF »\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon caution\n    return\nend try\n\ntry\n    set fileHandle to open for access theRichTextFilepath with write permission\n    write richTextfromClipboard to fileHandle\n    close access fileHandle\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File I/O Error...\" with icon caution\n    try\n        close access fileHandle\n    end try\nend try\n\nSecond piece of code (for when the clipboard contains HTML):\ntry\n    do shell script \"osascript -e 'try' -e 'get the clipboard as «class HTML»' -e 'end try' | awk '{sub(/«data HTML/, \\\"3C68746D6C3E\\\") sub(/»/, \\\"3C2F68746D6C3E\\\")} {print}' | xxd -r -p | textutil -convert rtf -stdin -stdout > \" & quoted form of theRichTextFilepath\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon caution\nend try\n\nThe blank lines do not have to be of a predetermined font type or font size; the blank lines should simply match the style of the surrounding .rtf file (that is, the style of the rich text on the clipboard).\n\nA: You can use this Cocoa-AppleScript:\n-- Cocoa-AppleScript-- you need these lines in your script\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\non insertTextInRTFFile(f) -- the parameter must be the posix path of an existing file, example  --> \"/Users/someName/Desktop/xyz.rtf\"\n    set myText to linefeed -- the text to insert in the rtf (a blank line as example)\n    tell current application\n        set fileURL to its (NSURL's fileURLWithPath:f)\n        set myOption to its (NSDictionary's alloc()'s initWithObjectsAndKeys_(its NSRTFTextDocumentType, its NSDocumentTypeDocumentOption, missing value))\n        set {attrString, docAttrib, err} to its ((NSMutableAttributedString's alloc())'s initWithURL:fileURL options:myOption documentAttributes:(reference) |error|:(reference)) -- get the attributed string from the RTF file\n        if attrString is missing value then error err's localizedDescription() as text -- not a RTF file or not a valid path\n\n        -- it use the string in the 'myText' variable to create an attributed string \n        set firstline to its ((NSAttributedString's alloc())'s initWithString:myText attributes:(attrString's attributesAtIndex:0 effectiveRange:(missing value))) --  create an attributed string with the style of the first character\n        set lastline to its ((NSAttributedString's alloc())'s initWithString:myText attributes:(attrString's attributesAtIndex:((attrString's |length|()) - 1) effectiveRange:(missing value))) --  create an attributed string with the style of the last character\n    end tell\n    attrString's insertAttributedString:firstline atIndex:0 -- insert an attributed string (blank line) at the top\n    attrString's appendAttributedString:lastline -- insert an attributed string (blank line) at bottom\n    set rtfData to attrString's RTFFromRange:{0, attrString's |length|()} documentAttributes:docAttrib -- create the data from an attributed string\n    rtfData's writeToFile:f atomically:true -- write the data to the RTF file\nend insertTextInRTFFile\n\nAfter your script will have written to the RTF file:\n just call the insertTextInRTFFile() handler with the posix path of the RTF file as parameter.\n", "Q: Using Exchange email in Mail on iOS and MacOS how can I have a single Junk folder?

This was a little hard to spot at first as Mail displays this folder as \"Junk\", you have to see it on other devices (e.g. Mail on iOS) or the web app to see that the folder is actually called \"Junk Email\".\nMy question is this: how can I tell one of these OSs to use a different Junk mail folder?\n\nA: On your Mac, in Mail.app, go to Preferences → Accounts → account name → Mailbox Behaviors and set Junk Mailbox to the correct mailbox.\n", "Q: How to switch input language with good old Cmd + Space in Sierra? It turns out that in macOS Sierra (10.12) by default you can switch between languages with Ctrl + Space while previously it was Cmd + Space which is faster to click because you can easily do it with just thumb.\nMy question is - is it possible to switch back to the Cmd + Space?\nFrom what I see now it's not doable\n \n\nA: ⌘+␣ and ⌘+⌥+␣ are now used to \"Show Spotlight Search\" and \"Show Finder search window\" respectively.  You will have to change those shortcuts before you can change these.

Should I consider both RAM and Logic board damaged or dismiss the freezing as likely the result of flakey Wi-Fi service?\nI started running the test after reinstalling Lion over Wi-Fi because the trackpad had been responding weirdly.\n\nA: Using AHT over a flaky Wi-Fi connection shouldn't cause any freezing, because the required software is downloaded in entirety first, and then run.\nIf you've been experiencing issues with the trackpad too, you might have a hardware issue with your Mac. I would look into the issue further, maybe by having Apple look at it.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite Recovery Disk Can I use the recovery partition or net installer to get a copy of Yosemite? Is that possible? I'd like to avoid a clean install. However, I need to upgrade a computer that would likely not run well with macOS Sierra. I need to upgrade a Macbook 2009 from Mountain Lion. My other MacBook has a version of Yosemite installed. \n\nA: If you've installed Yosemite before, you'll still be able to download it from the App Store (given that you're using the same Apple ID as when you first downloaded Yosemite.)\nSign in to the same Apple ID on the MacBook running Mountain Lion, and go to the Purchased tab in App Store.

I lost my iPhone and it had no password. I'd like to disable my Apple ID on it and wipe it. \nIs there any way to do it if I don't have the phone with me?\n\nA: Well, if you had Find My iPhone enabled, you can wipe the phone as a whole, or add a passcode.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iCloud.com/#find\n\n*Sign in\n\n*Select your phone from the list of devices\n\n*Select either 'lost mode' (add passcode and message to lock screen) or 'erase device' (you can't track your phone anymore if you do this)\n\n*Follow the steps outlined by the website. \n\n\nIn addition, Find My iPhone will show you the GPS location of your phone, which will help you track it. It cannot be disabled without your Apple ID password, and your phone cannot be wiped with it enabled.\nIf you choose to wipe your phone, nobody will be able to use it without your Apple ID email password\nFinally, if your phone is offline, these options will be applied as soon as the phone connects to a network.\nI'd highly suggest adding a passcode to your new phone.\n", "Q: Forgot iCloud Keychain password while updating iOS on iPhone 6s Plus I'm updating iOS on my iPhone 6s Plus, and forgot my iCloud Keychain passcode. \nIt gives me two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset keychain\n\n*approve from other device\n\n\nThe first option will erase all my passwords stored on my devices, which isn't acceptable.\nThe second option is unavailable. I tried to reset my passcode, but it can only send it to my phone - which cannot receive any messages.\nI tried to go to iCloud > Account details and reset from there, but it requests the passcode right after the password. \n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way to regain access to your iCloud keychain if you don't have access to your passcode or any other devices associated with your keychain. You'll most likely have to reset your keychain.\nIn the future, consider using a password manager like LastPass or KeePass.\n\nA: You could try calling Apple. If there is another way to authenticate yourself, it is possible that they will help. (You mentioned other devices, so it is possible that they can set up another of your devices to allow it to approve resetting the iCloud keychain passcode.) For obvious reasons, Apple does not publish the rules about what they will and will not do.

When we see the command feedback \"this incident will be reported\"; where is that reported to and how can I see it on macOS Sierra.\n\nA: The sudo logs now go to the new unified logging system in macOS 10.12, which can be searched using the log command.\nFor example, to show all sudo logs from the last 3 hours:\nlog show --style syslog --predicate 'process == \"sudo\"' --last 3h\n\nTo search all sudo logs for messages containing the string \"user NOT in sudoers\":\nlog show --style syslog --predicate 'process == \"sudo\" and eventMessage contains \"user NOT in sudoers\"'\n\nUse man log or log help show to learn more about how to use the command.\n", "Q: Adding a Google account in iMessage appears to be stuck I want to add a Google Hangouts / Talk account to iMessage. I am on OS X 10.12.3 (Sierra). After logging in to my Google account and after entering OTP, it brings me to a white screen that appears to be stuck. I already tried disabling OTP but it still gets stuck. I attached a screenshot.\n\nAnybody seeing the same issue?\n\nA: As of some time in 2017, gTalk is no longer available. Messages/iMessage/iChat used the gTalk service to send and receive hangouts messages. It seems Messages 11.0 (the one I'm using with 10.13.5 on late 2009 MacBook) no longer has support for any functionality whatsoever with Google services. gTalk (2005-2017) was the precursor to Hangouts though it seems Hangouts later had backward support for gTalk which is why IM clients using gTalk still worked up until some time last year.\nI submitted a feature request to add support in a future version of messages. It seems all the API technology is already available and that Messages and other clients merely need to add support in future versions of the messaging clients. You can submit a feature request to reinstate some method of Google service chat IM here. I bet if enough people request the feature, we'll see client support for Google IM return in a future version of Messages. I really miss it because I hate having to visit hangouts.com or mail.google.com every time I want to interact on hangouts.\nMost of the information in this post is obsolete as it seems Messages had a bug prior to gTalk being discontinued. However, it means nothing now since the API no longer exists.\nUpdate August 2018:\nI found a third-party Github project that works really well. Very nice interface. It seems that Apple is just too lazy to add support for the new API and, instead, have simply removed the ability to add other accounts in Messages.

I have an iMac and I have some mp4 videos in it. I'd like to play it from my iPad Pro remotely. Is it possible?\n\nA: If you want to leave the videos on the iMac but display it on the iPad, you could put them into iTunes on the iMac and then turn on Home Sharing on the iMac. This will allow iTunes to make your iTunes library available to any Apple device on your home network. (The videos will be in \"Home Videos\" in iTunes. In iOS 10.2, you use the TV app to play iTunes video content.)  You must also be signed into the same AppleID on both devices, and the iMac must be turned on.\nIf you don't want to (or can't) use iTunes, Plex can do something similar. Plex offers many additional features, but it is also more complicated to set up.\n", "Q: Listen to all voice mails on iPhone continuously On older phones I could start vmail going and just let it run - through all messages. There were options to perform actions as you went along. But if you just let it go it would play all messages and save them.\nI miss that:on the iPhone I have to mess with the keys for every message. The \"speaker\" , play/pause and go back are all v close to one another so it is frustrating. Also there is a few seconds of pause for the vmail to be retrieved - for each vmail.\nIs there any way to get the behavior of the older phones for vmail playback on the iPhone?  Essentially a hands-free full playback?\nthanks\n\nA: Visual Voicemail—where you can select which message you want to listen to instead of being forced to listen to them in a specific order—doesn't seem to allow continuous playback. Also, is suspect that the delay in retrieving a message is because it's contacting the carrier.\nIt may be possible to find an app that allows playback as you want, but beware of buying a an older app that may not work with more recent iOS versions or one that won't work with your carrier.\nI don't know what version of iOS you're running, but more recent versions (I'm looking at 10.2) have an improved interface for playback as well as transcription of the message.\n\nA: Of course.  Dial into your provider's voicemail system and use it as you like.  That's what it's there for.\nVisual Voicemail is there for random access to your voicemails.\n\nA: As you wish, changing from comment to answer:\nHave a look at YouMail, HulloMail, Google Voice and VisionMail Visual Voicemail. I'm not sure, whether or not they are capable of what you are expecting, but you can give them a try. The build in visual voice mail functionality of iOS won't match your expectations anytime.\nAlso have a look at the answer of @Margaret Martin. @Marc Wilson also provided a useful approach. :)\n", "Q: Main user gone after upgrading to MacOS Siera I have just upgraded to MacOS Siera, and all of my users are no longer recognized.\nI can see my user folder in the Users folder but OS won't recognize it.\nI have looked around but only found issues revolving FileVault, which I have not used in the past (though I have tried the suggested solutions and they did not work).\nTo make it clear - none of my old users are available.\nOne thing I have noticed is that the OS has technically installed on a different partition than the old OS, which might have something to do with that (I had a small, 256MB partition created to allow the installation process, as instructed on apple site).\nHow can I restore the users?\n\nA: If it's on a different partition, it's basically a different system.

How can I set it to be preset as nonlinear?\nSo looking to the images, I don't want it to be set like this:\n\nInstead I want it to be preset in this way, instead of clicking the actual function everytime to make it nonlinear.\n\n\nA: In recent versions of Preview there are two annotation tools which seem almost identical: Sketch and Draw.\n\nThey both allow you to draw lines, but the difference is that Draw does not try to use shape detection.\nSolution: Use Draw instead of Sketch.\nIgnore the misleading icons, where it seems that Draw has a thicker line. You can always set the line thickness.\nThis tool appears only on computers with a Force Touch trackpad, but this is the case for most MacBooks.\nNote: As said in a comment under, the Draw tool also changes the thickness of the line depending on Trackpad pressure, so consider this if you want to use the Draw tool as an alternative to the Sketch tool.\nIt was not a problem in my case, but it may be in yours, depending on how and why you need to draw on the PDF.\n\nA: It's currently not possible to disable the shape detection used by default in the markup tools.\n\nIf your drawing is recognized as a standard shape, it’s replaced by that shape; to use your drawing instead, choose it from the palette that’s shown.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20218\nYou can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html\n\nA: With MacOS 12.5 Monterey, things have changed.\nNow, after you draw the squiggly line, the default behavior is to turn it into a shape or straight line. However, as soon as the shape is made, the \"sketch\" icon has a drop down list with one choice being to leave it as drawn. You click that and it keeps what you drew.\n", "Q: chmod 760 or 777, could this be a security problem? I'm trying to build a local PHP server using XAMPP.\nWhen I'm trying to run one of the PHP files, I get an error about the fopen command in the file.\nFrom a quick search in the web, I've seen that in order to solve it I need to run this command on terminal:\nsudo chmod 777 file.extension\n\nOn the comments to this article, I've seen that I should use 760 instead of 777.\nMy question is what every chmod command can do? Can it be a security problem? What do you recommend me to do?\n\nA: See man chmod for what the command does. Basically it sets access permissions on files and folders, with the three digits standing for user, group and other permissions. So the first digit defines the permissions for the user owning the file, the second for the group owning the file, the third for anybody else.\nIn your case\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod 777 gives everybody read, write and execute rights which for most problems is definitively too much\n\n*chmod 760 gives all rights to the owner, read and write to the group owning the file and no rights to users which neither own the file nor are part of the owning group\n\n\nGranting too many rights might be a security problem, depending on whether other people can access your computer and/or your computer is accessible from outside. \nTo resolve apache/PHP issues, granting 777 seems to be rather broad. I would go with 664 (or even 660) first.\n", "Q: What should my home folder permissions look like?

As long as everything inside your folder is restricted, you'll be okay. Apple also doesn't recommend changing the permissions for your home folder. If you really want to, though, you can try it out and just use the following Terminal command to reset the permissions:\ndiskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u`\n\n", "Q: Shortcut to open file with alternative application You can set certain applications to open certain files by default. For example, .pdf with Preview, .jpg and .png with Preview, and .txt files with TextEdit.

I use it all the time, pretty much as fast as pressing hot key shortcut.\n\n\nA: Right click on the specific file, select \"Get Info\" and from \"Open with\" select the default application used to open such kind of file.

Shortly after that, I removed the yellow tag but the file keeps popping up in my Finder window. What should I do to remove that file from Finder?\n\n\nA: I have not found a stable way in the finder to apply tags. Usually any new method I try works for the first 5 files, and then the problems arise. Even the Get Info window will not reliably work (the tags appear to be fixed, but if you close the Get Info window and open it again, none of the changes have been kept).\nHowever, recently I have been applying tags through an application's Save dialog box. Often this works to add or remove tags when the Finder doesn't. Maybe that will work for this problem file.\n\nA: If I'm understanding you correctly, you tagged a file with the \"yellow\" tag, then later removed the tag. But when you view all files with that tag, that file appears in the view.\nI would try restarting the Mac. That may flush the system. I have found adding or removing tags in the Finder to be completely unreliable. The problem has existed for years and in Sierra it's still not fixed.

Suppose I buy an iPhone 7 directly from Apple, and I select the SIM-free version.  Will this lock to the first carrier it is activated with?  Or is it unlocked for life so I'll be able to switch carriers freely without restrictions?\nSearching online, I found some reports that claim past SIM-free iPhones might lock to the first carrier they're activated with (even if bought via Apple), but the sources don't seem fully credible to me.  Going through the purchase process on apple.com, Apple describes the phone as SIM-free but never calls it unlocked and doesn't seem to have any definition of what SIM-free means. That makes me wonder.\n\nA: According to Apple a SIM-free iPhone purchased directly via Apple should be unlocked. So, it is pretty unlikely that you get locked afterwards.\nFurthermore you should be able to use every SIM worldwide*.\n*considering there are no restrictions in the chosen country like e.g. in Turkey.\nEdit: This answer is based on the situation in the U.S. only. Other countries/markets may vary.\n\nA: It happened to me. Bought an iPhone SE directly from the Apple store, put in a Three SIM. When I moved to another country, I found out it was locked to Three even though I had ended my contract with them. It took 7 days to get an unlock code.\n\nA: Just had similar issue in UK, two iPhones purchased unlocked and sim free, they are both now locked to a carrier and have to wait 10 days to get unlocked. \n", "Q: Dim screen brightness of MBP, using AppleScript (and while using a secondary monitor)? I just got a secondary monitor to use with my MacBook Pro (13\" Retina Early-2015). I previously had AppleScripts for dimming and for increasing the brightness of the MBP screen—either to no bars or to about 75%—but now they aren't working for some reason (w/ or w/o the external monitor plugged in). I also tried using Shades but both screens keep flashing every 2-3 seconds (I'd rather use an AppleScript as well).\nBasically, my external monitor is my main screen and I want to be able to dim my MBP screen using an AppleScript to either no bars or about 75% (of which the scripts will then be redirected to keyboard shortcuts with an application).\nWhat AppleScript code would be needed to do this?\nEDIT: \nHere is the old that worked really well before, but for some reason stopped (with out without an external monitor plugged in).\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat 16 times\n        key code 107\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nand\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat 11 times\n        key code 113\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: Having a secondary monitor was not the issue, it was that I also needed an external keyboard.\nWhen using an external keyboard, the brightness key codes change from 107 and 113 to 145 and 144 respectively, to lower/raise the brightness level.\nFor anyone interested, the correct key code events that works with an external keyboard (tested/works with an external Apple keyboard) are:\nTo lower the brightness all the way use:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat 16 times\n        key code 145\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nThe above code will lower the brightness all the way, regardless of where it's currently set.

I have 2 MacBook Pros and one Thunderbolt Display (27 inch). Both MBPs support Thunderbolt connectivity and work fine with external display. I need a way to switch between 2 MBP, without changing the connection everytime. \nIs there any hardware / KVM switch which supports this functionality? \nMBP Models are as below:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch Mid 2012)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\n\n\nA: Responding 2 years later because I just had to solve this problem, and this answer wasn't super helpful when I was trying to.\nNew work insisted I use their Macbook pro for work, on top of the Macbook pro I already have (and use for personal projects / consulting gigs).\nHere's what I figured out (links to specific products below)\nThunderbolt's native Lightening 2->Mini Displayport F to Displayport->1x2 Displayport Switch->2 Displayport M to USB-C M cables.\nMini Displayport F to Displayport M - $10\n1x2 Displayport Switch - $36\nDisplayport M to USB-C M cables x2 - $12 x 2\nTheoretically you could use this approach to switch between a macbook and a PC on a Thunderbolt display, by using a Displayport M to HDMI M cable (like this $13 one).\n\nA: I do know of a Thunderbolt 2 Dock and KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) device that will allow you to do just this - IOGEAR Thunderbolt 2 KVM, Docking Station, GTD732\nThere are two key bullet points that address your specific situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Share your peripherals and Thunderbolt 2 devices between 2 computers\n\n*Supports 4K (UHD) resolution.

(The MBP 2012 and TB Display are both TB1)\nThunderbolt 2 is backward compatible with Thunderbolt 1 (the main difference being bandwidth)  so in theory, it should work just fine especially since you are connecting just one TB display.\nThe other major downside is that it's extremely expensive.

They might work for hours and then stop working again. The odd thing is that when they do stop working, so does the number zero (0). \nMashing the three buttons all at once (as one does when in frustration) sometimes solves the issue temporarily. I'm using the digital keyboard viewer in the case that i need to use a \"0\", and the \" ´ \" (directly to the left of Delete) key seems to constantly be orange. \nStrangely this highlight disappears when pressing either of the ⌘ Command  keys (using the mouse to press them on the keyboard viewer). Now, the thing that confuses me the most is the fact that when pressing both ⌘ Command  keys as well as 0 (physically), then pressing the highlighted \"´\" key, it types out \"n´-\" instead of just \"`\", which should be expected if the other keys weren't functioning. \nAll of this boggles my mind. Is there some simple thing I'm missing? I refuse to get my keyboard replaced as that last oddity implies there's nothing wrong with the keyboard itself...\nI've just found that a more reliable temporary fix seems to be to hold down both command keys, however pressing 0 once will undo the fix.\n\nA: Your keyboard is failing and should be replaced.\nThe keyboard is made up of \"layers\" with one of them being a flexible plastic \"circuit board\" with conductive traces.  The photo below shows a typical example of this (Disassembled keyboards from MacBooks aren't common so I used a PC keyboard - the technology is the same).  \nUpdate:  I wrote a canonical Q/A on this topic that shows much better breakdown of the keyboard assembly and goes in depth as to what the issues could be.\n\nThe keyboard recognizes a key press when a particular circuit (or circuits for multiple key presses) is/are closed.  It's a physical connection being made.\nIf anything gets between the contacts or if the contacts become worn, the keyboard will begin to malfunction as yours is doing now.  \nThis will only get worse.  Keyboards don't fix themselves and software fixes only go so far.  Your best bet is to replace the keyboard - and there's good news and bad news...\nThe good news:  A replacement MBA keyboard is relatively cheap; less than $20.\n\nThe bad news:  Replacing the keyboard will require you (or a tech) to completely disassemble your MBA.  This involves literally taking every single component out of your MBA.  It's not a hard process, but rather a long and detailed process.  Ifixit.com has an excellent step-by-step.\nIf you feel comfortable around electronics and you have done this type of thing before, I recommend that you give it a go at replacing it yourself.  \nIf this is not something you are comfortable with, I suggest hiring a tech.\n\nA: The key thing to understand here is that even if your keyboard has a 100 keys, there aren't 100 on/off switches with wires to your motherboard -- that would be too inefficient.  Instead, characters have codes, and it is these codes which are sent through these wires, and the number of wires will be much smaller. (This is also why you can't press more than a few keys simultaneously)\nTherefore it's possible that if one of these gets shorted for some reason, (spills being the most common) a particular set of keys would stop working as expected, while leaving the others unaffected.  Sadly Apple doesn't repair keyboards, only replaces them.  I had to give up a perfectly good Apple Keyboard for just 4 keys like you.  In my case it was the left and right arrows, left command, and tilde.\nEDIT: Whether or not it's a software error should be easy to check -- try the following (in order):\n- New user account\n- Different OS (Windows via Bootcamp, or just an Ubuntu Live USB)\n", "Q: How to downgrade subversion to version 1.7 I'm on OS Sierra.\nI currently have subversion 1.9 and I want to downgrade to 1.7.\nI tried this so far with no luck:\n$ brew tap homebrew/versions\n$ brew install subversion17\nError: No available formula with the name \"subversion17\" \n==> Searching for similarly named formulae...\nError: No similarly named formulae found.\n==> Searching taps...\nError: No formulae found in taps.\n$ brew search subversion\nhomebrew/versions/subversion18   \n\nWhat other options might I have?\nEdit:  More background:\nI'm getting this message when I run svn commands in my working directory:\n\n> svn: E155036: Please see the 'svn upgrade' command svn: E155036: The\n> working copy at '/Users/MyProject' is too old (format 29) to work with\n> client version '1.9.4 (r1740329)' (expects format 31). You need to\n> upgrade the working copy first.\n\n\nI'm worried if I run the upgrade I won't be able to talk to the server anymore?  And I have no control over what version the server is running and I don't think they would be willing to upgrade it.\n\nA: Whatever your underlying motivation or use case is: I personally recommended that you do not downgrade. Downgrading to Subversion 1.7 will put your Mac at risk.\nAlso, for technical reasons, Subversion 1.7 cannot run on El Capitan or later unless a developer is willing to spend considerable effort.\nThe subversion17 formula was deleted from Homebrew last month, albeit for unrelated reasons. Before it got deleted, a comment in the formula said:\n\n# Requires system OpenSSL headers to build. >El Capitan no longer ship them.\n# Note this means that this subversion is linked against an outdated OpenSSL\n# and really should not be considered secure.\n\nIn other words, not only is Subversion 1.7 unsafe to use on macOS; also, El Capitan or later versions of macOS cannot run 1.7 because the required header files are missing.\nFor the same reason, well-known Subversion download sources, e. g. WANdisco’s download page, offer Subversion 1.7 releases for OS X Yosemite or earlier but not for current macOS versions.\nAn alternative approach would be that you post a new question (or edit your existing one) to give more information on what your underlying motivation is.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are you actually trying to achieve specifically with the 1.7 release?\n\n*What specific issue(s) do you anticipate, or have already encountered, using the latest release of Subversion instead, or any other version control package?\n\nA: If\n\n\n*\n\n*your SVN client tells you it wants you to upgrade your working copy from format 29 to format 31,\n\n*and the server is not under your control,\n\n*and you’re not sure whether the server is going to support the newer format,\nthen these steps might help you get an updated working copy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the entire folder that is your working copy, including all subdirectories, especially those named .svn. Store your backup in a safe place that is outside your working copy.\n\n*If you’re comfortable with losing your uncommitted changes, you can simply check out a fresh working copy. Clients are made to work with old servers, so chances are this is the easiest option for you. If you’re fine with that, stop here. There is no step 3.\n\n*If you’re still determined to upgrade your existing working copy, cd to it and run svn upgrade. Don’t worry about breaking something; svn upgrade is not going to affect server state. If it fails, simply restore your backup or check out a fresh working copy.\n\n*If svn upgrade succeeds, you might want to make sure whether the server is still going to well with your newly upgraded working copy. So it’s time to do a quick check and see for yourself. To prepare for that, do svn update first. If svn update fails, try fixing all the issues before you go on to the next step.\n\n*As a final test, make a change and check it in so you can see whether the server accepts that, too. For example, create a dummy change you’re comfortable with checking into the repository, e. g. a new file named deleteme.txt. Or just add a newline to some existing source code. If your working copy already has some uncommitted changes you’re comfortable with committing, you can simply use those.\n\n*Commit the changes you’ve chosen.\n\n*If svn commit returns an error, you still have a few options: as a first step, try and fix the issue yourself; or open another question to ask for help (stating exactly what you did, what you expected, and what actually happened); or edit your existing question; alternatively, simply check out a fresh working copy (see step 2).

How do I know if an update requires restart in macOS Sierra? I just updated iTunes and read the description of the update, but couldn't find any mention of a restart required. After a moment the computer restarted without a warning. Luckily, I wasn't in the middle of anything important, but I'd like to avoid such forced restarts in the future.\nEdit: There was also a macOS Sierra update today. In the figure below, there's no mention of a restart required. I also followed the two links, but found no mention there either. I'm pretty sure that the info shown here was the same prior to the update.\n\n\nA: When you look at the Updates list in the Mac App Store, it will indicate in the info if a restart is required. Below is an example of this:\n\nYou will see the words Restart Required followed by an icon of a white triangle within a grey circle (looks like a reverse play button).\nPrior to installing the update, just check the info against each update to see whether any of them require a restart.\nSecurity updates and OS updates usually require a restart. Most other apps don't.\n", "Q: Restoring from backup does not restore some applications - I need their data badly Well, I've got my iTunes backup restored to my iPhone. Unfortunately, I've had an important application for me - Photo Drag Pro, which was probably now removed from the App Store. However, I need to restore data from that application. \nThe application itself shows for a few moments on a home screen, noting \"Wait\" and then disappears. Is there a possibility to restore that application, possibly with data? It means a lot for me!  \n\nA: The actual app isn't backed up in the iOS backups, but the data for the app is backed up (unless specified not to by the developer - very rare) and a reference to the app is stored so that it can be re-downloaded from the app store. That's why you saw the \"Wait\" icon while it tried to download.\nI would go into the App Store app and tap Updates > Purchased and triple check if you can download Photo Drag Pro from here. (The policy on whether developer-removed-from-sale apps appear in this list changes more frequently than I pay attention ;) I assume right now it won't appear, but it's worth checking.)\nIf that doesn't work, then your only option may be to try to pull the data for Photo Drag Pro out of the backup using a third party tool that reads iOS backup files. There are a handful of options; the one I work on is called Decipher Backup Browser https://deciphertools.com/decipher-backup-browser.html. You can use this to open and save the files from Photo Drag Pro out of the backup and onto your computer. If you need help locating the Photo Drag Pro data in the \"All Files\" section of DBB, there's contact links on our website and we'll help (and feel free to mention Kelly specifically if you want to make sure your email gets directly to me!)\n(Note: As I mentioned, I'm a developer for the software I linked to.

AHT worked a week ago, no problem. I'm 100% sure I have the right disk. I've successfully run AHT many times using this disk in the past. \nWeirdly, I can still boot to Recovery Mode from the same disk by hitting Command + R (unfortunately, can't reach AHT that way). I ran First Aid from disk just in case, no problems found. So the disk drive, disk, and keyboard all seem to work okay.\nI shut down, hit D right after hitting the power button, and screen goes gray forever, never boots. Same thing occurs when pressing Option at boot to choose the boot disk... goes to gray screen, never boots. I'm using a wired USB keyboard (a Microsoft brand, but I'm accounting for default option key vs. command key vs. windows key, etc.). I also tried hitting D at different times after hitting power, before hitting power, and tried different USB ports for the keyboard. Unplugged everything. All fails. \nI assume my HD recovery changed something. Apple support said they think my disk is bad, which I don't buy since it worked last week.  \nPerhaps relevant: I want to use AHT because — before I recovered my HD — AHT indicated I had bad ram. (Ram problems were intermittent). I wanted to determine which of my two chips was bad by using just one or the other and repeatedly running AHT to find which individual chip is bad. Currently using just one of my two 4GB chips, which I guess could be related, if it's the bad one. MacMini is a 3,1 Intel currently running 10.11.6 btw. \nThanks a lot for any advice.\n\nA: My first thought was that perhaps you had somehow updated the firmware and were trying to use an AHT disk that couldn't boot due to this. This is a possibility because your Mac Mini came pre-shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.6, but the firmware update (which you do have installed) requires Mac OS X 10.5.7. However, then I realised your question says you only just ran the AHT last week. So, unless you somehow updated the firmware in the past week, this isn't likely to be your problem.\nSince you can't seem to get your disk to work, the only other option I can think of is to download AHT again and run it from a USB. The steps to do this are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB flash drive by using Disk Utility's Erase function. Make sure you choose OS X Extended for the format and the GUID Partition Map for the scheme. For the purposes of these steps, also give your USB the name AHT when you're erasing it.\n\n*Download the AHT for your particular Mac Mini here\n\n*Mount the downloaded image (it should mount as AHTCThree)\n\n*Now you will need to copy the AHT to your USB flash drive. To start, Launch the Terminal app (usually found within the Utilities folder)\n\n*In the Terminal window, enter the following:\ncp -r /Volumes/AHTCThree/System /Volumes/AHT/\n\n*Now we need to make the USB flash drive bootable, so enter the following line in Terminal:\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/AHT/ --file /Volumes/AHT/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics/diags.efi --label AHT\n\n*Enter your Admin password\n\n*Leave the USB flash drive plugged in and restart the Mac Mini\n\n*Immediately hold down the Option key\n\n*Select the AHT from the list and boot up\nNOTE for other readers: - These Terminal commands were written for this specific question. However, these can be adapted for your use by replacing the AHTCThree with whatever name your downloaded disk image mounted as at Step 3. For example, if at step 3 your downloaded disk image mounted as AHTEOne, then at Step 5 you would use AHTEOne instead of AHTCThree within the Terminal command.\n\nA: Maybe this is a long shot, but I could imagine that repairing your recovery partition could do the trick. This article describes the procedure:\nNote: This procedure can potentially destroy all data on your disk and you should make sure you have a working backup ready.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a copy of the “Install OS X” or “Install Mac OS X” from the Mac App Store under the “Purchases” tab which matches the version of system software on your Mac (for example, the “Install OS X Mavericks” app, or “Install macOS Sierra” app)\n\n\n*Go to the developers website here and download the latest version of Recovery Partition Creator, it’s an AppleScript that will handle the recreation of the recovery drive\n\n\n*After the app has downloaded, right-click on “Recovery Partition Creator.app” and choose “Open” to bypass Gatekeeper\n\n\n*Follow the onscreen instructions, and select the primary drive you want to restore a recovery partition onto (typically Macintosh HD unless you named the drive differently, or are using a separate disk\n\n\n*Point to the Mac OS X installer application you downloaded in the first step and let the AppleScript do it’s work\n\n\n*When the Recovery Partition Creator app is finished running, reboot the Mac and hold down Command+R to boot into Recovery and confirm the recovery partition now exists and works as intended\n\n", "Q: Apple Watch shows only new message from whats app user but not the message itself I have an Apple watch (2016, V1) and a friend have an Apple watch (2016, v1).\nOn my watch it shows the message directly on the watch.

My goal is to get 10.2 on the new one (NOT 10.2.1!!). I tried a iTunes and iCloud backup but the version is still 9.3.5 :/\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: First of all, iTunes backups don't contain firmware, so they can't upgrade or downgrade your device. They only contain data like messages, contacts and application documents.\nYou won't be able to install iOS 10.2, as it is no longer being \"signed\" by Apple. Only firmwares being signed by Apple can be installed on devices - as such, only iOS 10.2.1 can be installed. You can check which firmwares are currently being signed by Apple at https://api.ineal.me/tss/status.\n\nA: Well, since iOS 10.2.1 is the current version, the only way to get around this would be to download the iOS 10.2 IPSW file directly. There are a number of locations online from where you can do this (here for example).\nYou just need to ensure you download the correct IPSW file for your model iPhone.\nBroadly, the steps for doing this manually with an IPSW download are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac/PC download the IPSW file that corresponds with your iPhone\n\n*Connect your iPhone via USB to your Mac/PC\n\n*Launch iTunes on your Mac/PC\n\n*Click on the device summary for your connected iPhone\n\n*On a Mac press the Option key (or on Windows, press the Shift key) and simultaneously click on Update within iTunes\n\n*Find and select the IPSW file you downloaded to your Mac/PC\n\n*Follow the instructions and then click on Download and Update\n\n\niTunes should now update this particular phone to iOS 10.2.\n[EDIT]\nI've just checked and Apple has in fact just recently stopped signing iOS 10.2. As a result, while the above steps provide the process for manually installing a version of iOS via a IPSW file, the window for doing this can be pretty short as all installations are verified by Apple's signing process. In this case, that window has closed.\nAs an aside, the iOS 10.2.1 update was only quite minor over version iOS 10.2, so perhaps you could ask another question relating to whatever the issue may be with iOS 10.2.1 that you're trying to avoid?\n", "Q: Is there an app for running Go code on an iPad? I know that there are multiple compiler apps for iOS, such as Pythonista. There are also apps to compile programs in other popular languages, like C++, C, and Java. However, as much as I have searched, I cannot find anything that runs Go code. As far as I can tell, there is only one app that is even Go-related on the App Store: Go By Example, which doesn’t compile code.\nIs there any other way to run Golang code on an iOS device? Or is there an app that I am missing?\n\nA: As far as I am aware, unfortunately, there are no iOS apps for running Go. You could try to add a shortcut to https://play.golang.org to the homescreen; this effectively emulates the functionality of being able to type and compile Go code. However, needless to say, this requires an Internet connection and so is of limited use if you really need to edit \"on-the-go\" (no pun intended). \nThere are a plethora of developers who have created apps for large varieities of languages, but, as you acknowledge, Go is consistently omitted from their repertoires. If you search for a popular language, like Python, for example, then choose one of the apps for it and look at more by the same developer, there is usually a large range of associated apps, each dealing with its own programming language. In searching for Go apps, I repeated this process many times, and found apps for Lua, Groovy, Haskell and other not-so-mainstream (by which I mean less popular according to TIOBE) languages, but no Go. My search however, was by no means exhaustive, and this seems to be a much better avenue than simply using the built-in \"search\" feature on the App Store, so, if you are really desperate for offline functionality, I would consider carrying on along these lines (if you have not done so already).\nIf you can wait to compile your code until you are online (on play.golang.org), then there are several text editors with Go syntax support (Coda for iOS is a personal favourite).\n", "Q: trimforce enable does not work I am using 2009 macbook pro and I wanted to upgrade the default hdd to a Samsung Evo 850.

When we want to add a printer to mac, we go to \"Printers and Scanners\" in system preferences. There we click on \"+\" button and click on \"Add Printer or Scanner\". In new dialog with title \"Add\", we see a list of printers.\nWhen we select one of the printer: printer-x, we see status: \"Gathering printer information...\". And its driver is automatically selected. How is Mac gathering printer information? What is this whole process of adding a printer in details? Is there any tutorial/article that can help? I have tried google search, could not find something of good interest yet.\nI want to debug a situation where Mac is choosing driver for a printer sometime and sometimes it does not (for the same printer). Expected driver to see there is AirPrint. The printer is being added from a print server. So, want to have a look at what is happening in the background.\n\nA: After carefully looking at the DNSCache and Network:\nMore details on dns-sd.org however in short, for everything to work correctly, following four DNS Records for each printer are needed on client side in case of airprint/secure airprint:\n\n\n*\n\n*PTR record of type _universal._sub._ipp/ipps._tcp  (lets call it universal): needed only if printer is airprint compatible (see dns-sd.org)\n\n*PTR record of type _ipp/ipps._tcp (lets call it ipps)\n\n*SRV record\n\n*TXT record\nSRV record tells about the service related data (server/port etc.) and TXT record tells about the printer capabilities.\nOn Mac, \"ipps\" and \"universal\" records are queried by different processes (printtool and PKBrowserServic respectively). From observation: Queries of \"universal\" records by PKBrowserServic are more frequent than queries of \"ipps\" records by printtool. So, in a scenario: it has universal records but not ipps, it won't identify the driver. \nTo answer the original question: when a printer is selected, it queries for SRV and TXT record (based on universal or ipps records which are in cache already, thats how we see the printer in the list). If printer/print server is not available or if ipps record is missing, mac won't be able to do 'Auto Select' for the driver.\nThis problem can be fixed in multicast by self-querying both universal and ipps before TTL of the records expire so that the caches of all mac clients are updated.\nIn case of unicast, mac has high TTL of universal/ipps records, so it might take some time for ipps record to be updated in the cache in a new network but in few minutes (max 10 mins from observation), it has both ipps and universal and the issue does not exist anymore.\nAnother way to handle it quickly is to clear cache (sierra: killall -HUP mDNSResponder)\n\nA: If the printer supports IPP or IPPS (the Internet Printing Protocol), macOS sends an IPP query to the print device to ask for all the features it supports.\nBased on the device's response, it sets up the print queue (by auto-generating a PPD file, PostScript Printer Description) so that the available job options are listed in the user interface of the print dialog.\nYou can simulate this query and see the respective responses by printers with the help of two command line programs which you can start from the terminal: ippfind and ipptool.\nFirst, run ippfind\nippfind [ENTER]\n\nThis will return a list of all IPP-capable print devices (or shared CUPS print queues) in the LAN and WLAN you are connected to. The list will include the IPP device URI which can be used to address the print device.\nSecond, run ipptool\nNow you can use the IPP device URI found in the previous step to send a Get-Printer-Attributes query to the print device or print queue:\nipptool -t -v                 \\\n    <IPP-DEVICE-URI>          \\\n    get-printer-attributes.test\n\nYou can now see the response for the query in your terminal.\n", "Q: How to delete iCloud Backups?

However, keep in mind your SATA cable may be the culprit (see next step).\n\n\n*Check SATA cable: The SATA cables of the unibody MacBook Pros are known to cause all kinds of issues. In case your SSD proves to be ok, consider replacing the cable.\n", "Q: Is there a faster way to insert text at cursor in AppleScript than \"keystroke\"? This is for a .scpt file, triggered by a keyboard combo in FastScripts, entitled \"Type As Single Line Plain Text.\"\nThe AppleScript code takes the clipboard text, removes all rich text formatting, and then removes all line breaks and indentations, setting this new string to a new variable, theClipboardTextWithoutAnyLineBreaksOrFormatting. Finally, I want the AppleScript to insert this new text at the blinking cursor.\nBut, I don't want to overwrite the original clipboard with this new, plain text string. I simply want the new string typed out at the blinking cursor, system-wide and in any application. keystroke does accomplish exactly what I want. It is just slow.\nHere is the full script:\nset theClipboardTextWithoutAnyFormatting to (the clipboard as text)\n\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {return & linefeed, return, linefeed, character id 8233, character id 8232}\nset theClipboardTextWithoutAnyLineBreaksOrFormatting to text items of (theClipboardTextWithoutAnyFormatting as text)\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\" \"}\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke theClipboardTextWithoutAnyLineBreaksOrFormatting\n\nThe problem with this method is that if theClipboardTextWithoutAnyLineBreaksOrFormatting contains a very long string, for example 2000 characters, then it will take a while for all of the text to be typed out, since it is being done manually in real time.\nIs there a better way?\n\nA: Yes.\nUser @jackjr300 has devised an ideal solution to this question here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to keystroke special characters in AppleScript?\nThis solution works system-wide and does not affect the clipboard.\nThe provided TypeCharacters Objective-C file is significantly (i.e., exponentially) faster at typing text than AppleScript's native keystroke command.\n", "Q: Can't use Boot Camp with drive already partitioned I'm running OS X Yosemite on a recently formatted 2010 MBP.\nWhen I formatting the drive / installed Yosemite, I partitioned it with one partition called OS X and another partition simply called Partition.\nI would like to install Windows 7 onto Partition and I'm under the impression I need to use Boot Camp in order to do that... it's been many years since I last did this however.\nWhen I try to start Boot Camp, I receive the following error:\n\nThe startup disk must be formatted as a single Mac OS Extended\n  (Journaled) volume or already partitioned by Boot Camp Assistant for\n  installing Windows.\n\nI was expecting to be able to view the partitions using Boot Camp, am I misunderstanding something? Do I need to re-partition my harddrive?\nOr can I just insert my Windows disc and boot from Partition when starting up my Mac?\n\nA: To do it the 'easy way', fully utilising Boot Camp, you need to start with one single volume on the Mac [ignoring the hidden volumes].\nBoot Camp will then repartition for you & set up Windows on that new partition. Removal is then just as simple, using Boot Camp.  \nBoot Camp does more than just partition the drive, it sets Windows up in such a way that it is unaware it's being 'fooled' into thinking it's in charge of the drive.\nResist the temptation to ever change the volume structures any other way; tears will ensue ;-)\nBest way to go right now would be to remove that extra partition in Disk Utility & extend the main one back to the entire drive, then let Boot Camp re-partition in its preferred way.\nIt can be done other ways, but none of them are as simple.\n", "Q: iCloud Music Library and external HDD here's a issue – since I moved my iTunes Library to external HDD, every time I launch iTunes it asks Apple ID password.\n\nWhen I enter the login/password – all works almost perfectly after that, e.g. I can use iTunes Store, download my recent purchases. \n“Almost” because except iCloud Music Library:\n\nAnd the same issue repeats if I close and re-open iTunes, it asks Apple ID password again. Any ideas how to solve this problem?\n\nA: I just had the same problem after moving my iTunes library to my home NAS. Deauthorising and then reauthorising worked for me.\n"]
